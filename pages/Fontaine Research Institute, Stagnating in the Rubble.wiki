==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|After navigating an incredibly cumbersome procedure, you take on an assignment related to the Fontaine Research Institute. But before you can officially begin, though, you have to undergo a final review...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Katheryne, optional)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Why does Katheryne look so stressed out?
:'''Katheryne:''' ...This adventurer didn't pass the review either. I wonder what's wrong.
:{{DIcon}} Did someone not pass the Guild review?
:'''Katheryne:''' Ah, {{Traveler}}. *sigh* I'm afraid that this isn't really a Guild affair, but a commission from the Fontaine Research Institute.
:'''Katheryne:''' I'm sure you've heard that the full name of the Fontaine Research Institute is "Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering." Before the... explosion, it was the technological center of the entire Court of Fontaine.
:{{DIcon}} I think I've heard of it before.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers! Someone named [[Edwin Eastinghouse|Edwin]] made a mistake, and there was an explosion at the Fontaine Research Institute, right?
:'''Paimon:''' A commission from a place that blew up once? Sounds dangerous.
:'''Katheryne:''' That is true. According to the Fontaine Research Institute, the commission is rather difficult, and not for just anyone.
:'''Katheryne:''' So those who want to give it a try must go to the specified location to undergo a series of qualification reviews, and they must prepare their own documents and certifications.
:{{DIcon}} Is a Mondstadt flying license acceptable?
::'''Katheryne:''' As an addendum, yes. They actually have a list of documents that you must bring.
:{{DIcon}} Is an arrest warrant a document?
::'''Katheryne:''' I think it counts as identification, but may not be something you want to submit. Anyway, they have a list of documents that you must bring.
:'''Katheryne:''' The list includes your current and previous Adventure Handbooks, your commissions from the last eighty days, and more. Some of them even require stamps from the [[Maison Gestion]].
:'''Katheryne:''' And that's not all. Even if adventurers have all the documents and proofs ready, and arrive at the specified location to be reviewed...
:'''Katheryne:''' They will not be able to accept the commission if they fail just one item of the qualification review.
:'''Katheryne:''' If the adventurer is not willing to accept other work arrangements, then they will be rejected.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds really strict.
:'''Katheryne:''' Yes, a lot of them went excitedly, only to return angry. This commission has become so infamous that no one wants to be reviewed anymore.
:{{DIcon}} Now I'm kind of interested...
:{{DIcon}} That sounds challenging.
:'''Katheryne:''' You want to be reviewed!? That... That would be a huge help!
:{{DIcon}} Don't get too excited...
:'''Katheryne:''' Thank you for lending the Guild your aid! Please wait here while I get all the required documents ready for you.
:'''Katheryne:''' Do you have a pen? Oh, don't worry, I'll go get a few bottles of ink.
:'''Paimon:''' A... few bottles? Is one not enough?
:'''Katheryne:''' I... can't say. But don't worry, I'm very familiar with these documents, so just follow my instructions.
:'''Katheryne:''' First, one proof of your adventure qualifications, one thirty-day travel history, and one registration of past and current Adventure Handbook serial numbers...
:'''Katheryne:''' Now for your commission history, income statement, commission evaluations, commission statistics, and average positive ratings.
:'''Katheryne:''' For your resume, fill in your habitual residence, contact address, contact information, emergency contact, your current name, names you've used in the past, any pseudonyms, and aliases that you use when you want to conceal your identity.
:'''Katheryne:''' Now you have to sign the good faith commitment, a notice of liability, a notice of obligation, and a notice of exemptions on information release for legal purposes. And...
:{{DIcon}} This monologue's great, give us another!
:{{DIcon}} My writing hand is tired from just listening to the list of documents.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, that's a lot of documents.
:{{Black Screen|With Katheryne's help, you start filling out the forms. Alternating between hesitance and doubt, you use up bottle after bottle of ink, but the stack of forms also gradually shrinks. As you finish the last form, both Katheryne and you breathe a sigh of relief...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Finally! So this commission's complete, then?
:{{DIcon}} It hasn't even started!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't think this commission would be so troublesome. But if we don't go to the review, then we've wasted our time...
:'''Katheryne:''' Well then, we'll leave this commission to you!
:{{DIcon}} I haven't even passed the qualification review yet.
:'''Katheryne:''' You'll be fine, I believe. As the receptionist of the Adventurers' Guild, I know what you're capable of.
:'''Katheryne:''' If Fontaine Research Institute rejects you, then there's no one else in Fontaine who can take this commission.
:'''Katheryne:''' I'll mark the location on the map. Go there and find someone named [[Desnos]], who is stationed there and will guide you.
:'''Katheryne:''' Thank you again. You've done the Guild a huge favor!
:'''Katheryne:''' *sigh* If possible, I'd prefer to not have to stamp a single adventure qualification more. The way this is going, I'm going to wear the stamp out...
----
;(Approach the Recon Log Meks)
:;(If Katheryne was spoken to)
:::'''Paimon:''' This should be the place Katheryne marked for us, but there seems to be nothing here...
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, there seems to be someone...
:;(If Katheryne was not spoken to)
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh... Just what kinda place is this, it's all run-down and shabby...
:::'''Paimon:''' Eh? Wait, it seems like there's someone over there...
:'''???:''' Help! You over there! Don't just watch! Save me!

;(After defeating the Recon Log Meks)
:'''???:''' There's no end to these stupid meka! Oh, my lovely, muscular legs are now full of these horrid welts and bruises...
:'''???:''' Thank you, friend. If it weren't for you, I'd still be taking a beating from those meka...
:'''Desnos:''' Oh, sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm [[Desnos]], a member of the Fontaine Research Institute, an assistant researcher... Or so I used to be.
:'''Desnos:''' Now I'm responsible for receiving the adventurers who come here for recruitment and conducting preliminary qualification reviews.
:'''Desnos:''' They're called preliminary qualification reviews, but it's more just me checking if they're carrying all the proper documents with them.
:;(If Katheryne was spoken to)
:::{{DIcon}} So, tell me about the Institute's commission...
:::'''Desnos:''' Ah! You're here for the recruitment too? Sorry, please excuse my manners. Let's talk business then, shall we?
:::'''Desnos:''' Did you bring all the documents with you? If not, I can help you with the ones you're missing.
:::{{DIcon}} Got 'em all right here.
:::'''Desnos:''' Good. Let's see...
:::'''Desnos:''' One proof of adventure qualifications, and one thirty-day travel history, all nice and clear. This'll do just fine.
:::'''Desnos:''' Uh... I notice you've only got one Adventure Handbook with you. I'm gonna need you to show me all the Adventure Handbooks you've used and are currently using so I can take a photo of them.
:::{{DIcon}} This is the only one I have...
:::'''Desnos:''' Well, you're quite the young and promising one then... Ahem! No matter. It's easier having everything in one book anyway.
:::'''Desnos:''' Now for your commission history, income statement, commission evaluation info, commission statistics, and average positive ratings... Hmm, you're very hardworking, and you've quite the income, too!
:::'''Desnos:''' Good faith commitment, a notice of liability, a notice of obligation, and a notice of exemptions on information release for legal purposes. The last one wasn't really that necessary, but... oh well. Still...
:::'''Desnos:''' Very good! Well done. All your documents are with you. Thank heavens! You're the only candidate within the past two weeks who actually prepared all the proper documents.
:::'''Desnos:''' Now all you need to do is go to the Fontaine Research Institute to undergo a final review.
:;(If Katheryne was not spoken to)
:::'''Desnos:''' After all, some adventurers can't even get their documents right...
:::{{DIcon}} Adventurers who come here for recruitment?
:::{{DIcon}} So, you're looking for adventurers?
:::'''Desnos:''' Yes, as you said, we've been asking the Adventurers' Guild to recruit adventurers who can investigate and search the ruins of the Fontaine Research Institute.
:::'''Desnos:''' After all, nearly the entire Institute was destroyed in the explosion, and we don't have a lot of manpower.
:::'''Desnos:''' This violates the Institute's non-disclosure agreements and some other work regulations, of course, but technically only on paper...
:::{{DIcon}} I think I've heard of this incident before.
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers! Someone named [[Edwin Eastinghouse|Edwin]] made a mistake, and there was an explosion at the Institute, right?
:::'''Desnos:''' Oh, so everyone knows, do they? Ugh, must've been some journalists from [[The Steambird]] with nothing better to do...
:::'''Desnos:''' Anyway, that's what happened, and that's where we're at now.
:::'''Paimon:''' In other words, you're looking for people who are good at searching for things in ruins?
:::{{DIcon}} We're good at that.
:::{{DIcon}} This doesn't sound too hard.
:::'''Desnos:''' I can see that you're more confident than ordinary people, and I believe you've got good reason for that kind of confidence. I'm glad you're interested in the commission.
:::'''Desnos:''' But if you really are planning to take it up, I'll have to ask you to fill out some simple forms.
:::{{DIcon}} Like the other adventurers?
:::{{DIcon}} Is this the qualification review?
:::'''Desnos:''' Yes, your comprehension and attention are excellent... Better than ones who came before you, anyway.
:::'''Paimon:''' Sounds like a lot of work. We don't usually have to jump through all these hoops when we take a commission...
:::'''Desnos:''' Well, the commission concerns confidential items within the Fontaine Research Institute. The ruins contain scholarly papers and research results that must be retrieved.
:::'''Desnos:''' These are assets of the Fontaine Research Institute, and they are the foundation for rebuilding the Institute &mdash; indeed, the hope of the entire Court of Fontaine!
:::'''Desnos:''' Only trustworthy, upright, elite adventurers may enter the ruins, and that's why we have to run a qualification review. It's also why I'm here to do the preliminary part of it.
:::'''Paimon:''' Oh... and how many elite adventurers have you recruited so far?
:::'''Desnos:''' Um, well, it's complicated. The ones I had high hopes for declined because they were in bad shape at the time. Anyway, at this point, well... Alright, we have none.
:::'''Paimon:''' Are your standards too high? How else would you end up not finding a single adventurer.
:::'''Desnos:''' These are the rules set by Mr. [[Choiseul]], and I can't do anything about it. In fact, I have even helped many adventurers to polish up their documents.
:::'''Desnos:''' But even so, no adventurers have passed the review set by Mr. Choiseul and Mr. Raimondo.
:::'''Desnos:''' But don't worry, you're already much better than the previous ones, so your chances of passing are certainly higher.
:::'''Desnos:''' Please sit here while I go get a few bottles of ink. We'll be filling out some forms.
:::'''Paimon:''' A... few bottles? Is one not enough?
:::'''Desnos:''' Based on my experience, if you didn't bring any documents, then one bottle is definitely not enough.
:::'''Desnos:''' First, one proof of adventure qualifications, one thirty-day record of travel history...
:::'''Desnos:''' Actually, I'm sure that the Adventurers' Guild has these records. Don't worry, I'll write you an official letter to explain the situation, and we'll request said documents from the Guild.
:::'''Desnos:''' But for the resume, you'll have to fill in your habitual residence, your contact address, contact information, your current name, names you've used in the past, your pseudonyms, and aliases that you use when you want to conceal your identity.
:::'''Desnos:''' Then, you have to sign the good faith commitment, a notice of liability, a notice of obligation, and...
:::{{Black Screen|With Desnos's help, you start filling out the forms. Alternating between hesitance and doubt, you use up bottle after bottle of ink, but the stack of forms also gradually shrinks. As you finish the last form, Desnos smiles and you breathe a sigh of relief...}}
:::'''Desnos:''' That's all the documents. Now you just need to go to the Institute itself for the final review.
:'''Desnos:''' I was meant to be the one to take you there, but those stupid meka injured my leg.
:'''Paimon:''' It's okay! Just tell us where it is, and we'll head on over there ourselves!
:'''Desnos:''' Sounds good. I'll mark the location down on your map... Oh, and by the way! I suggest you head straight to the roof and talk to Mr. [[Nacker]].
:'''Desnos:''' The Institute sent him to work in the area. You can go talk with him. There are lots of clockwork meka in the nearby wilds, so he's definitely going to need a formidable guard.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait. We haven't passed your final review yet. Why are you assigning us work already?
:{{DIcon}} And there's no compensation either.
:'''Desnos:''' Well now, just hear me out &mdash; Mr. Nacker's a senior researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute who once even did research under Edwin, so he's got some sway in the institute.
:'''Desnos:''' If you were to get along well with him and "incidentally" demonstrate your capabilities to him to prove your worth... then you're gonna have much better chances at passing the review!
:'''Paimon:''' So what you're saying is that we should help this Mr. Nacker, and thank him for the privilege while we're at it?
:'''Desnos:''' Precisely. You can tell him: "Before arriving at the Fontaine Research Institute for the final review, Mr. Desnos has first tasked me with being your guard and ensuring your safety."
:'''Desnos:''' Anyway, I won't hold you up any longer. He should be on the roof. I've still got to... Ouch, my leg... Those stupid meka...

;(Talk to Desnos again, optional)
:'''Desnos:''' Darn it... Who in the world designed these meka here?
:{{DIcon}} Why are we having the preliminary review here, by the way?
:'''Desnos:''' Why not conduct a review at the Fontaine Research Institute, you mean?
:'''Desnos:''' Well, it's because of that huge explosion, of course.
:'''Desnos:''' After the Institute blew up, the roads that led here from the Court of Fontaine were cut off for the most part. Not to mention the area around the Institute itself... They're a total mess.
:'''Desnos:''' This is where Mr. Raimondo's project team was originally located, a place far enough from the center of the explosion to not be greatly impacted by it. You know, meaning "lots of people who are still alive."
:'''Desnos:''' You know what I mean. Even though most of the Fontaine Research Institute was destroyed... our offices must continue operating. Otherwise, who will rebuild it?
:'''Desnos:''' That's why they had him go back urgently, and also made the decision to seek assistance from adventurers.
:'''Desnos:''' We are also following the Institute's orders, and are here to receive adventurers that come here to apply.
:'''Desnos:''' Although many areas around the Institute have been cleaned up and it's about time we return to our offices...
:'''Desnos:''' Mr. Choiseul has stated otherwise: "There are many things to do and we should focus on a bigger picture. Stay where you are if possible."
:'''Desnos:''' ...And just like that, our tiny office wound up staying right here.
:'''Desnos:''' *sigh* I seriously wonder when I'll be able to return to the Institute...
----
;(Approach Chronie and Nacker)
:'''???:''' I've said this many times, Ms. Chronie. Rebuilding the Fontaine Research Institute is our only goal right now.
:'''Chronie:''' You've said the same thing three times now. Hmph. I know all too well that when you guys start repeating things like robots, there's definitely something big that you're trying to hide.
:'''???:''' ...Think what you like. As for the numerous issues you mentioned earlier, I suggest you go talk to Mr. Raimondo.
:'''Chronie:''' What, is he going to tell me all the things the Fontaine Research Institute is hiding?
:'''???:''' No, but his ways of beating around the bush might be more sincere.
:'''Chronie:''' You...
:'''???:''' Anyway, Ms. Chronie... I have my own business to attend to. The one next in line has been waiting for quite a while now.
:'''???:''' Hello, how can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Are you Mr. Nacker?
:'''Nacker:''' Yes, I am.
:{{Black Screen|You introduce yourself to Nacker and describe the final review situation. Upon mentioning Desnos, you remember what he last told you...<br>"Before formally arriving at the Fontaine Research Institute for the final review, Mr. Desnos has first tasked me with being your guard and ensuring your safety."}}
:'''Nacker:''' I see. Thank you for applying, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}... and I suppose I must also thank Mr. Desnos's injured leg.
:'''Nacker:''' Hmm... The wilds around here do pose many dangers, and having an adventurer capable of passing the preliminary qualification review by my side would be a lot safer.
:'''Chronie:''' I can't act like I didn't hear that. What dangers are there exactly, if I may ask? According to the investigations, lots of [[Arkhium]] flew out of the Institute when it exploded.
:'''Chronie:''' Will the uncontrolled Arkhium radiate energy? Will it contaminate the surrounding environment?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Wouldn't this entire area be contaminated, then?
:{{DIcon}} I suddenly feel somewhat short of breath...
:'''Nacker:''' That's just your imagination at work. *sigh* After leaving its catalytic environment, Arkhium immediately returns to an inert state. It won't radiate or contaminate anything.
:'''Nacker:''' It is apparent that Ms. Chronie's way of phrasing her concerns brought you unnecessary misunderstandings.
:'''Nacker:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}}, may I take another look at your documents? If you really wish to escort me, then we'll have to take something of a detour.
:'''Nacker:''' I'm going to a few nearby places to review the technological assets of the Institute and nab some documents along the way.
:{{DIcon}} Who's this lady next to you...
:'''Nacker:''' Some reporter, that's all.
:'''Chronie:''' Indeed, that is what I am. It's a great honor to meet you, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}. I've heard your name from my colleagues many times before.
:'''Chronie:''' I'm Chronie, a journalist for the political affairs section of The Steambird. If you have time, could we arrange a time to have a chat?
:'''Chronie:''' And of course, Ms. Paimon is also welcome to join. I'm very interested in your adventures.
:'''Chronie:''' Let me see... How does next Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday sound to you guys? Even this Saturday could work. We could go for a cup of coffee.
:'''Nacker:''' Or how about right now? You guys stay here and chat, and I'll go about my work duties.
:'''Chronie:''' That won't do. I've already reserved today's entire interview schedule for you. Sorry, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Paimon, we'll have to chat another time.
:'''Paimon:''' That's okay! We've got work to do today anyway!
:{{DIcon}} We need to escort Mr. Nacker first...
:'''Nacker:''' *sigh* I must stress again that I'm just an ordinary researcher now, and I have no further information to give you.
:'''Nacker:''' Plus, we've also got tedious and meaningless work ahead of us. Even if you go ahead and interview me, you won't get any useful information from it.
:'''Chronie:''' That won't be a problem, Mr. Nacker. All work has its own unique value, and it's our job to uncover it... Don't worry about me.
:'''Nacker:''' ...Suit yourself then. Let's get going, {{Traveler}}.
:'''Nacker:''' According to the schedule, there's a document we need to get at the institute's Executive Office. Hopefully, [[Conjat]] wasn't called up for some other work...
----
;(Enter the office)
:'''Nacker:''' This is it here. Hang on a second while I go find Ms. Conjat...
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... What's that place... A building floating in the air?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it! This must be one of those magical "I only want the second floor, just cut the first floor out!" buildings that you hear about in stories.
:{{DIcon}} The Fontaine Research Institute's science is the finest in the world!
::'''Paimon:''' It really is!
:{{DIcon}} Was this caused by the accident?
::'''Nacker:''' Indeed it was.
:'''Nacker:''' *sigh* What you're seeing now is the Central Laboratory of the Fontaine Research Institute... Or should I say, what was once the Central Laboratory.
:'''Nacker:''' Mr. Edwin Eastinghouse was once within, trying to develop a field generator using Arkhium. Initital estimates indicated that the device could lift an entire block of buildings.
:{{DIcon}} My guess is that the experiment didn't turn out so well.
:'''Nacker:''' Of course, had Mr. Edwin not left two-thirds of the Fontaine Research Institute in ashes, he would've been a shoo-in for the post of the next Director.
:'''Nacker:''' And today, the heavy responsibilities that belong to the post of Director, including a lifelong stipend and private dwelling, must be borne by the likes of Choiseul and Raimondo.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon wonders just what kind of people Raimondo and Choiseul are...
:'''Chronie:''' According to the evaluations of my peers, they are the type who can speak to you for an entire day without saying anything. I want to put that to the test.
:'''Paimon:''' ...?
:'''Nacker:''' So, it is exceedingly accurate to say that Mr. Choiseul's talents are irreplaceable.
:'''Nacker:''' Look, {{Traveler}}. The location of your final review is the former location of the [[Alain Guillotin Research Institute]], and now the current residence of the Institute.
:'''Nacker:''' Before the incident, weekly lectures were held there regarding critical projects. Of course, the old administrative functions are all still in effect, and can handle the final review.
:'''Paimon:''' What's that plaza for? There are even seats around it... Is it an amphitheater of some kind?
:'''Chronie:''' Ah! I have heard colleagues stationed at the Institute speak of this place! That is the sacred ground to Fontainians, the place where [[Fonta]] was born!
:{{DIcon}} "Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!"
:'''Nacker:''' *ahem* That is the Fontaine Research Institute's [[Academic Assembly Hall]], and is dedicated to the purpose of displaying the fruits of our research. Such as the combat-capable Artificed Dancers, the gramophone, and Turbine-Powered Glider, among others.
:'''Chronie:''' Previous analyses of Institute assets show that, of the items I mentioned previously, Fonta may be the only scientific achievement that remains legally profitable.
:'''Nacker:''' I couldn't help but notice your wording contained a few baseless accusations.
:'''Chronie:''' I'm glad you noticed. In that case, would you mind giving me your opinion of the ongoing criminal activity of selling off research materials from within the Institute?
:'''Nacker:''' It is absolutely vile, and those involved in the matter ought to be arrested in accordance with the law.
:'''Chronie:''' Huh. Well, then, out of those with access to the Institute's technical assets and the capacity to commit such a crime, who do you believe it was exactly? Could it be possible that it was...
:'''Nacker:''' It was a criminal.
:'''Chronie:''' ...
:'''Nacker:''' {{Traveler}}, let's keep moving.
:'''Nacker:''' Hmm... I need to go to a file storage room first, and retrieve a [[Survey Anchor]], which we can use to monitor the strength of the energy flows... It's not far, let's go.

;(Talk to Conjat, optional)
:'''Conjat:''' This document needs to be filed, and this one rewritten... Ugh... There's just so much to do...

;(Approach the meka on the road between the Executive Office and the Academic Assembly Hall)
:'''Nacker:''' Careful, these clockwork meka are quite aggressive.
:'''Nacker:''' Looks like Mr. Desnos was quite thorough. There's no way the young reporter lass and I could deal with them.
----
;(Enter the Materials Office)
:'''Chalmet:''' Mr. Nacker, you've finally come...
:'''Nacker:''' We came across a little hiccup on the way. Never mind that. Have you retrieved the Survey Anchor yet?
:'''Chalmet:''' I was just about to bring that up with you. I don't know if it was due to the explosion, but the supporting tools that were kept here are all damaged.
:'''Chalmet:''' You should know, if you don't use the proper tools to retrieve the Anchors, you will be subject to being struck by high-intensity Arkhium energy flows...
:'''Chronie:''' Oh... intense energy flow from the Arkhium, got it...
:'''Chalmet:''' Huh!? I... What I just said was just... I&mdash;I didn't...
:'''Chronie:''' Relax, sweetie. You were merely speaking the truth. It's not like you offended anyone.
:'''Nacker:''' What Ms. Chalmet said was indeed the truth. I hope that I can say the same for what you shall write.
:'''Chronie:''' Whenever the truth is placed right before me, I never pretend that it's not there. That would be a mistake.
:'''Nacker:''' Is that so? Well, it takes only the slightest bit of effort to fixate on something, but it always takes more brain power to avert your gaze from it.
:'''Paimon:''' It's clear they're not having an argument with each other, but why does Paimon still feel like the vibe is even scarier than if they were...
:{{DIcon}} Hurry and think of something, almighty Paimon!
::'''Paimon:''' Eh!? Why Paimon? Um... Um... how about we just get down to business!?
:{{DIcon}} Let's... deal with the Survey Anchor first, shall we?
:'''Nacker:''' You're right. Ms. Chalmet, let's go examine the Anchor.
:'''Chalmet:''' O&mdash;Okay then. That said, the area where it's located is still blocked. I'll go ahead and open those ports and unblock it...
:;(The group walks onto the balcony)
:'''Nacker:''' {{Traveler}}, as I recall, you were an adventurer who came for the recruitment, yes? Well... when assisting our Institute in its work, you'll sometimes be required to carry out certain... precise operations.
:'''Nacker:''' I'd like to see your practical capabilities first. Could you please go and help Ms. Chalmet operate the Energy Transfer Terminal to clear the area where the Survey Anchor is of obstructions?
:{{DIcon}} I guess I could...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks she's heard of this story somewhere before! It's something like... "Your test began the moment you set foot in this area"!
:{{DIcon}} So, the review has already begun?
:'''Nacker:''' You could say that. If you pass the final review, then we'll do a detailed competency assessment for you.
:'''Nacker:''' After all, everybody excels at different things, and the work they can take on also differs.
:{{DIcon}} And so their compensation will differ as well?
:'''Nacker:''' Hahaha! How very blunt of you, but you're not wrong.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh! Then we've got to show them our worth, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Nacker:''' Just treat this as an early assessment. Ms. Chalmet is over there. She'll explain to you how to operate the Terminal.
:'''Nacker:''' Please follow her instructions and unblock the area as soon as you can. I'll be watching you from the side.

;(Talk to Chronie, optional)
:'''Chronie:''' If I may, Mr. Nacker, could you explain what would happen if someone were to be directly hit by intense energy flowing from Arkhium?
:'''Nacker:''' Coma, subcutaneous bleeding, vomiting, and so on. Would you like me to list them all one by one?
:'''Chronie:''' If the Survey Anchors really are that dangerous, why would you place them in a room? You know, it feels like you're... placing a coffee maker.
:'''Nacker:''' I've already repeatedly emphasized that as long as you follow operating procedures correctly, you should not be at any risk of direct contact with said energy flows!
:'''Nacker:''' As for why they're locked up in a room... Well, it's to prevent certain idiots from taking any Anchors away without authorization, of course.
:'''Nacker:''' They have no idea how they work and just figure that they might sell some shiny things for a profit.
:'''Nacker:''' We've hung up signs, distributed flyers, and even specially organized a lecture to try to tell everyone that not only were they worthless, but they could also do you harm.
:'''Nacker:''' However, the Anchors continue to be stolen, and thus we've had no choice but to lock them up in a room... This is the truth. Are you happy now?

;(Talk to Nacker, optional)
:'''Nacker:''' Please follow her instructions and unblock the area as soon as you can. I'll be watching you from the side.

;(Talk to Chalmet, optional)
:'''Chalmet:''' Hello! Mr. Nacker has already told me that you're here to learn how to operate the Energy Transfer Terminal. Is that right?
:'''Chalmet:''' I've written the operating instructions down for you. Feel free to take a look at them.
:;(Opens the [[Tutorial/Energy Transfer Terminal|Energy Transfer Terminal tutorial]])
:'''Chalmet:''' Um... good luck with your assessment.

;(After unlocking the door)
:'''Nacker:''' Excellent work, the lock has been opened! Your abilities to quickly grasp the mechanics and execute are both outstanding, and your value far exceeds the vast majority of those who participate in experiments. I will truthfully report your performance as such.
:'''Paimon:''' So what's next... Whoa! Ms. Chronie, what's gotten into you?
:'''Chronie:''' Um... Ugh! I suddenly... feel like I'm gonna throw up... Ugh!
:'''Chalmet:''' Ms. Chronie, please, drink this medicine. Exposed Survey Anchors radiate with Arkhium energy traces, and the place we are in now has also been affected somewhat.
:'''Chalmet:''' However, this energy level won't leave permanent adverse effects on the body. Just take this medicine and you'll be fine.
:;(Paimon and the Traveler look on as Chronie takes the medicine off-screen)
:'''Chronie:''' Blech! It tastes terrible. Forget it. I guess this is also a kind of first-hand experience...
:'''Chalmet:''' {{Traveler}}, these two bottles are for the two of you. Please drink them quickly.
:{{DIcon}} I'm feeling fine. Let Paimon drink it.
::'''Paimon:''' But Paimon isn't feeling any discomfort either... Plus, the medicine doesn't taste so good, right? Um, Paimon would rather not take it...
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, but I'm not feeling any discomfort at all...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon neither!
:'''Nacker:''' Really? That's really quite interesting, and is completely at odds with the results of the "Applications of Arkhium Risk Report: 3rd Edition." We all should have been affected by the same amount of Arkhium energy...
:'''Paimon:''' Harrumph! We're constantly journeying over mountains and seas... We're way stronger than the people you've got working here!
:'''Nacker:''' Correction: You can now assume that all of the Fontaine Research Institute's staff are now working out in the open, beneath the sun and stars. Your report might consider mentioning the difficult work conditions we are enduring, Ms. Chronie.
:'''Chronie:''' Ah! I've been wronged without having been notified in advance! The Steambird won't just let this go!
:'''Nacker:''' Putting this all aside, you clearly have an extremely strong innate tolerance of the energy flow, {{Traveler}}. If so, you are certainly the best candidate to assist the Institute, without question.
:'''Nacker:''' Please approach the storage room, and report any dizziness, nausea, itchiness, or any other discomfort you feel during the process.
:'''Chronie:''' Hold on there! Are you using {{Traveler}} as a guinea pig? Without fulfilling your obligation to inform {{MC|m=him|f=her}} of the risks first?
:'''Nacker:''' It is clearly stated in "Institute (abbr.) Externally Contracted Employee Agreement, Appendix C.41," which {{MC|m=he|f=she}} signed!
:'''Nacker:''' Prior to being officially employed, the applicant shall be subject to a harmless Arkhium energy flow tolerance test, and the Institute has the right to terminate the contract based upon the results of said test.
:{{DIcon}} I hate reading text.
:{{DIcon}} Who the heck reads all that!?
:'''Nacker:''' You chose not to exercise your right to read the text, but each document was clearly marked, "Please sign your name after carefully reading the document and making sure there are no mistakes."
:'''Nacker:''' However, seeing as you seem completely unaffected by the energy flow... I believe you may be just the person we're looking for.
:'''Nacker:''' In any case, let's get down to business. Take three steps toward the storage room, then hold still for thirty seconds.
:{{Black Screen|You follow Nacker's series of complicated instructions and slowly approach the storage room at a steady pace.<br>However, just like before, you don't feel any discomfort.}}
:;(Chalmet, Chronie, and Nacker look on from above as Paimon and the Traveler enter the unlocked room. After they walk in, Traveler raises a hand to their head.)
:'''Paimon:''' We've gone this far, but Paimon still doesn't feel anything. Do you feel any discomfort?
:{{DIcon}} Ah! My head! It feels like it's gonna explode!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh!? What's wrong? {{Traveler}}, are you alright!?
::{{DIcon}} Pfft...
::'''Paimon:''' Okay, okay, that was good acting! You nearly fooled Paimon there, sheesh... But...
:{{DIcon}} I'm feeling the same as always.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's a relief, then. Paimon was worrying about how she'd carry you out of here if you were to suddenly pass out.
:'''Paimon:''' Although, we've come all this way, and we can't see Nacker or the others anymore, and it doesn't seem like we can hear them either. What do we do next?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon knows! Maybe they'll chuck some sort of box in here and communicate with us through that!
:{{DIcon}} That would be quite handy.
:{{DIcon}} Do they even have technology that cool?
:'''Paimon:''' We'll find out soon enough! Heh, Paimon can't wait to see what kind of cool gadgets they might use to communicate with us...
:'''Nacker:''' {{Traveler}}! Can you hear me!?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! So they rely on the technology of shouting really loud!
:{{DIcon}} I can hear you!
:{{DIcon}} (Shh...)
::'''Paimon:''' What are you doing!? Stop joking around at a time like this!
::'''Paimon:''' We can hear you!
:'''Nacker:''' Do you guys feel any discomfort!?
:{{DIcon}} Everything's good!
:'''Nacker:''' That's great! Please continue on to the Survey Anchor. You should be able to see it now!
:'''Nacker:''' Once you retrieve it, it will temporarily fall into a dormant state and stop radiating energy, and then we'll be able to come in! *cough*... Ahem...
:'''Paimon:''' Be careful! If you feel uncomfortable, then we'll get out of here.

;(Talk to Chalmet, optional)
:'''Chalmet:''' Huh? Back up here already? Have you retrieved the survey anchor?

;(Talk to Nacker, optional)
:'''Nacker:''' The Survey Anchor... hasn't been retrieved yet, I see. Have you come back up for a quick break?
:'''Nacker:''' That's fine, but please retrieve it as soon as you can. We'd prefer to avoid further trouble, you see.

;(Talk to Chronie, optional)
:'''Chronie:''' {{Traveler}}, how did it feel for you to be that close to a Survey Anchor?
:'''Chronie:''' If you feel any discomfort, then let me know immediately! I'll help you get the truth out there, even if Mr. Nacker tries to hide it.

;(Read the book on the left-hand table, optional)
:'''"What if We Do It This Way?":''' (This seems to be a reference book intended to impart practical techniques.)
:'''"What if We Do It This Way?":''' (The book lists a great number of issues that Fontainians are quite unlikely to encounter in their daily lives, and provides rigorously logical solutions to said problems.)
:'''"What if We Do It This Way?":''' (However, both the title page and the ending contain requests from the author for readers to not do such things in practice.)

;(Read the book on the table to the upper right side of the Survey Anchor, optional)
:'''"What Should I Do?":''' (This appears to be a reference book meant to teach common knowledge to people who have yet to come of age.)
:'''"What Should I Do?":''' (But why is it placed inside the Institute's Materials Office...?)

;(Read the book on the bookshelf on the right side of the room, reached by climbing the ladder; optional)
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' (This seems to be a literary work of fiction.)
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' (In this book, the entire Fontaine Research Institute was transported to a fantasy world, and many researchers go on adventures together in this other world.)
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' (There is a note stuck at the end of the text, with the following comments written on it:)
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' ("Why do I still have to carry mechanisms and fight monsters even in another world? How is this any different from real life?")
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' ("Is this what counts for popular novels within Institute circles? You might as well write one in which Mr. Edwin travels to another world with his Arkhium.")
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' ("Please refrain from placing novels inside the Materials Office. Also, Mr. Edwin has stated that he has no interest in traveling to other worlds.")

;(Read the book next to the gramophone behind the Survey Anchor, optional)
::'''Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering'''

::<br>
::(The text that follows is too marred to be discernible.)

;(Retrieve the anchor)
:'''Nacker:''' You... actually managed to retrieve the Survey Anchor without any instruments, like it was nothing.
:'''Chalmet:''' That's amazing. The last time, we needed at least three of us acting together to retrieve an Anchor.
:'''Nacker:''' Haha! I'm most certain that you're exactly the talent we've been looking for. With your help, all of our work is going to go much more smoothly.
:'''Nacker:''' Alright, I'll keep it for now. Let's leave this place and report back to the institute post-haste.
:'''Paimon:''' Hang on, where's Ms. Chronie? Paimon doesn't see her anywhere...
:'''Chalmet:''' She was feeling nauseous, so she stayed up there to rest.
:'''Chalmet:''' But don't worry, she's already taken her medicine. She just needs a little time...
:'''Chalmet:''' Huh? Ms. Chronie, what are you doing here...
:'''Chronie:''' A bunch of meka monsters suddenly showed up outside! They're on my heels, about to storm in!
:{{DIcon}} Well, thank you for that!
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:'''Paimon:''' Look out, {{Traveler}}! Over there!

;(After defeating the meka)
:'''Nacker:''' Phew... luckily {{Traveler}} was here. These were probably the clockwork meka that the Institute used before to monitor energy flow, as they're equipped with Arkhium energy flow monitoring devices.
:'''Nacker:''' Although they're now out of control, they still automatically converged here upon detecting the energy flow from Arkhium...
:'''Chronie:''' Mr. Nacker, should the Fontaine Research Institute be held accountable for these out-of-control meka in the wilds?
:'''Nacker:''' I don't object to that at all. They should be held accountable...
:'''Chronie:''' Oh?
:'''Nacker:''' If you truly have a way to have those buried in the ground rise up and speak again.
:'''Nacker:''' Also, I sincerely suggest that you stay here and rest, Ms. Chronie. Mr. Choiseul and Raimondo are at the Institute's new site, and they aren't going anywhere.
:'''Nacker:''' Once you're feeling better, then you can go and interview them.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! You felt so sick that you could barely even stand. Don't push yourself too hard.
:{{DIcon}} Your health is essential.
:'''Chronie:''' No... I can't. Interviewing Choiseul is the final step, not the beginning.
:'''Chronie:''' That's why I'm following Mr. Nacker around... I... I want to experience everything firsthand and get tangible evidence.
:'''Chronie:''' I have to question Choiseul with evidence in hand. That way, he won't be able to beat around the bush like last time.
:'''Chronie:''' Hehe, and lo and behold, I've now personally experienced this so-called "harmless" Arkhium energy flow, no?
:'''Chronie:''' Once I get to the Fontaine Research Institute, I'm definitely going to uncover all... all of the hidden truths...
:'''Nacker:''' ...*sigh* I truly admire your professionalism, Ms. Chronie, but are you sure you'll be able to make it the rest of the way there?
:'''Chronie:''' Don't worry, I'll be right behind you guys. I'm a reporter, after all.

;(Talk to Chalmet, optional)
:'''Chalmet:''' The backup medicine is also nearly finished. I'll go back and get more from the Institute later...
:'''Chalmet:''' Wait, do we even have any medicine left...?
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Nacker:''' We're here. This is the Mary-Ann Memorial Park. Let's see if there are any assets that can be recovered in this area.
:'''Paimon:''' This is a park, but it doesn't look like a park at all.
:'''Nacker:''' When the explosion happened, this place was hit by the first shock waves, and most of the buildings here were destroyed.
:'''Nacker:''' But there might've been some paper assets that survived the blast... That's what I'm hoping, anyway.

;(Interact with the investigation point near the broken machines)
:'''Nacker:''' These materials are so broken up they're just detritus now... Leave them be.

;(Interact with the investigation point near the canvas)
:'''Nacker:''' "Miniaturized Personal Recording Device" experimental results... Not bad.
:'''Nacker:''' [[Maillardet]] will be happy to see this. He's always wanted to put miniaturized gramophones inside Artificed Dancers...

;(Interact with the investigation point near the sideways pipe)
:'''Nacker:''' Uh... This just looks like old copies of The Steambird. Just toss them, they won't be useful.

;(Interact with the investigation point near the two upright pipes)
:'''Nacker:''' Financial reports from the Research Institute... but looking at the year... long out of date.
:'''Nacker:''' Hmm, best take them with us. Perhaps they might yet be useful.

;(Approach the next area)
:'''Nacker:''' Let me see... Oh, there might be something under the storage drums over there.
:'''Paimon:''' Is this pile of storage drums... also Institute property?
:'''Nacker:''' I guess so, but we'll need to remove them to see if there are more valuable assets here.

;(Retrieve the item inside the investigation point hidden underneath the drums)
:'''Nacker:''' Alright, there seems to really not be anything of value here... It's time to move on.
:'''Chronie:''' A researcher who once worked together with Edwin Eastinghouse is now kicking storage drums around in a junk heap...
:'''Chronie:''' Meanwhile, the Fontaine Research Institute still complains about being short-handed, huh... The way these researchers go about things is truly unfathomable.
:'''Nacker:''' Everybody's worth is reflected in different ways, and "kicking storage drums" is my way of doing so these days.
:'''Chronie:''' But I've heard that prior to Edwin's big screw-up, you had quite some sway in the Institute. Some might even say that you were... second only to Edwin himself.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh!? You were that powerful!?
:'''Nacker:''' That no longer means anything. Now I'm merely someone who was fortunate to survive this project, and one of the culprits who turned the Central Laboratory into what it is today.
:'''Nacker:''' This is the only information I can offer you, Ms. Chronie.
:'''Chronie:''' Well, I believe that was plenty. Let me write that down. Huh? Where are my pen and notebook? My whole bag disappeared...
:'''Chronie:''' I put it right next to a strange-looking meka just now. Where did they go?
:{{DIcon}} You mean... the one behind you?
:'''Chronie:''' Huh?
:'''Chronie:''' H&mdash;Help!

;(After defeating the meka)
:'''Chronie:''' What's up with these meka monsters? Why do they move sometimes and stop moving at others!?
:'''Nacker:''' I fear that anyone who could've answered your question is now... well, indisposed.
:'''Nacker:''' Let's hurry over to the Institute. {{Traveler}} needs to participate in the final qualification review, after all.
----
;(Enter the research institute)
:'''Choiseul:''' Raimondo, nothing could go wrong here, right?
:'''Raimondo:''' Everything is running according to the set orbit, Choiseul. Round and round it goes, without any errors.
:'''Choiseul:''' Error-free everything might be, but I'm just worried about getting dizzy...
:'''Nacker:''' Mr. Choiseul, Mr. Raimondo.
:'''Choiseul:''' Ah, Nacker! It's great to see you. Have you taken care of those Survey Anchors?
:'''Raimondo:''' I trust that you've done as you always have &mdash; complete your tasks to perfection.
:'''Nacker:''' I have. Allow me to give you two a brief report...
:'''Nacker:''' With {{Traveler}}'s assistance, the Anchor was successfully retrieved without any equipment.
:'''Choiseul:''' That's unbelievable! You were able to retrieve one without the use of any instruments? Goodness! Thank heavens.
:'''Choiseul:''' The entire Institute right now only has three complete sets of such equipment, and I was honestly worried as to how we might retrieve the Anchors as soon as possible.
:{{DIcon}} I didn't really do anything special...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah... It felt just like any other commission that we've done!
::'''Choiseul:''' No, no, for you to have retrieved an Anchor at all is special enough as-is.
:{{DIcon}} It was nothing compared to other things I've been through.
:'''Chronie:''' Is there any critical data in the Anchor, Mr. Choiseul?
:'''Choiseul:''' Haha, of course not...
:'''Choiseul:''' ...some insignificant data, Ms. Chronie.
:'''Chronie:''' I agree with you. After all, there's no way for insignificant data to radiate with harmful Arkhium energy flows, is there?
:'''Choiseul:''' E&mdash;Energy flow? I mean, uh... Of course! It's necessary... and must exist... as a technological means of preserving the...
:'''Chronie:''' What I'd really like to know is... Why the Fontaine Research Institute would place these Survey Anchors to monitor the Arkhium energy flow after the explosion?
:'''Choiseul:''' Certainly. Obviously, these Survey Anchors are... Uh... used for monitoring...
:'''Paimon:''' Ms. Chronie talks so fast! Like...
:{{DIcon}} A Dendro Slime on fire.
:{{DIcon}} A Whopperflower spitting fireballs.
:'''Chronie:''' Allow me to be more specific. How exactly is the Fontaine Research Institute planning to deal with this explosion?
:'''Choiseul:''' Uh... yes, I was just about to answer that question. This was an excellent question to ask, as many people... are concerned about it...
:'''Raimondo:''' Ms. Chronie, I am so delighted that you've come to visit again. I must stress on behalf of Mr. Choiseul that the institute has never changed its solution to the explosion.
:'''Raimondo:''' Once we have recovered all of the retrievable research assets at the old site, we will demolish the old Central Laboratory and do our best to restore the area's natural environment to its original state.
:'''Paimon:''' By the Central Laboratory, you mean that building floating in the air? How are you going to demolish a building like that?
:{{DIcon}} Shoot it down with a cannon?
:{{DIcon}} Blow it up, just like before?
:'''Raimondo:''' Of course we shan't be using such crude and simple solutions. This demolition will utilize our newly-researched "Experimental Field Generator."
:'''Raimondo:''' This device can deactivate the Gravity-Altering Field that surrounds the Institute's ruins and land them on the ground safely...
:'''Chronie:''' But wasn't this device also within said ruins? And wasn't it also a work of Edwin Eastinghouse that used... Arkhium as its energy source...?
:'''Chronie:''' So, based on what you're saying, the Fontaine Research Institute is still unwilling to give up this "harmless" Arkhium project, yes?
:{{DIcon}} I think they're not giving it up so easily.
:'''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You've been keeping up with what she's saying?
:{{DIcon}} Nope, I just repeated her last sentence.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Have you been doing this to pretend that you understand what's going on?
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, anyways, the Fontaine Research Institute is still trying to do dangerous stuff in dangerous ways, right?
:'''Chronie:''' A great summary, Ms. Paimon.
:'''Raimondo:''' If we're discussing uncontrolled risks, well, even walking on a road may be dangerous. Also, you should note that the energy source we're using is the completely new and stable Tri-State Arkhium.
:'''Chronie:''' How does that differ from normal Arkhium? Does the new word in front of it mean anything? This, to me, seems like a purely rhetorical maneuver.
:'''Raimondo:''' I'm sure Mr. Choiseul would be happy to have an in-depth conversation with you about grammar, but I've left Mr. Nacker hanging for too long. And really that's just impolite.
:'''Raimondo:''' Mr. Nacker, I trust that you've done everything that I've asked?
:'''Nacker:''' With {{Traveler}}'s help, everything couldn't have gone any better.
:'''Raimondo:''' ...Hmm, is this an adventurer who came for recruitment?
:{{Black Screen|Nacker recounts to Raimondo everything that happened, emphasizing the amazing talent you displayed when retrieving the Survey Anchor. He also briefly touches on Chronie's ironclad professionalism as well as the severe vomiting reaction she had. From the joking look on Nacker's face, there seems to be no ill-intent in his jest about the committed reporter... or so you assume.}}
:'''Raimondo:''' ...That is rare. Extremely rare. I'm delighted that you're applying for work at the Institute, {{Traveler}}.
:'''Raimondo:''' After hundreds of years of bad luck, we're finally catching a break... I'm confident that you'll be of great help to us.
:{{DIcon}} Here are the documents I signed...
:'''Raimondo:''' Ah, leave them over there. Don't worry about them.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Aren't you going to take a look at them? We spent ages on them, and Mr. Desnos also took them very seriously...
:'''Raimondo:''' Hahaha, these documents definitely have their uses. They certain help us weed idiots out, at least.
:'''Raimondo:''' As for you, however... I believe that your good qualities go far beyond what they can summarize. So let's leave them alone for now.
:'''Paimon:''' So, are you saying we passed the review?
:'''Raimondo:''' Without a doubt, yes.
:'''Raimondo:''' I will personally prepare the contract and notice that you'll need to sign for follow-up work. Until then... Mr. Nacker?
:'''Nacker:''' Yes?
:'''Raimondo:''' While Ms. Chronie appears to be having a discussion about energy safety with Mr. Choiseul...
:'''Raimondo:''' How about you take {{Traveler}} to retrieve the last two Survey Anchors?
:'''Raimondo:''' The energy flow control operations are nearing completion, and all that's left is the data compilation. *sigh* Oh well, at least everything is under control...
:'''Chronie:''' ...Are you guys heading somewhere else? I'll come along too!
:'''Paimon:''' This reporter lady sure has pretty good ears...

;(Talk to Choiseul or Raimondo again, optional)
:'''Choiseul:''' What should we do, Raimondo? Do you think we can convince this journalist? Tri-State Arkhium... I always felt that that name would bring us trouble.
:'''Raimondo:''' Choiseul, do you think that the name is not up to current grammatical standards and that people will criticize us for being superficial?
:'''Choiseul:''' No! Tri-State Arkhium may be different from Arkhium in name, but it looks exactly the same no matter how one looks at it!
:'''Raimondo:''' This is not a problem, as its internal structure is indeed different. The difference between it and Arkhium is like good guys and bad guys. They're both people, but they're very different in society.
:'''Choiseul:''' Ah, Raimondo... People never bother to tell the good guys from the bad guys, much less the nature of a piece of rock.
:'''Choiseul:''' They'll just say, hey, this rock looks like Arkhium, and it works like Arkhium, so why isn't it called Arkhium?
:'''Raimondo:''' Relax, Choiseul. I've already prepared the explanation script.
:{{DIcon}} (Keep listening...)
::'''Raimondo:''' See? "...The energy source that drives the Experimental Field Generator is not Arkhium, but a new one called Tri-State Arkhium."
::'''Raimondo:''' "This type of ore is an inert variant of Arkhium that was created through a special transformation process. After entering the all-new 'silent excitement state,' it is much more stable than the original's excited state."
::'''Choiseul:''' This won't do! They'll still just say that we're doing some kind of rhetorical trick!
::'''Raimondo:''' "This rhetoric is also based on strict academic classification. All in all, you will witness its excellence after this display."
::'''Choiseul:''' *sigh* But this certainly won't be able to satisfy that group of reporters.
::'''Raimondo:''' They can never be satisfied. Mr. Choiseul, all we need to do is put on a display... That's all.
:{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)

{{Quest Description|update|You arrived at the new Fontaine Research Institute and met with co-administrators Raimondo and Choiseul. After a long, mind-numbing conversation, you were tasked to escort Nacker and retrieve the last two Anchors. Perhaps it's a part of the final review...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Raimondo after retrieving the other 2 anchors)
:'''Nacker:''' Mr. Raimondo, the survey anchors have all been retrieved.
:'''Raimondo:''' Looks like we've really got the right person for the job this time. Put them over here. Someone will come and handle them.
:'''Raimondo:''' Now... let us get down to business. Come over here please, {{Traveler}}. There are some documents you'll need to sign.
:'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;They're so thick! Why are there so many documents!?
:'''Raimondo:''' Because no matter how one looks at it, escorting a researcher into the ruins of the Fontaine Research Institute and then landing said ruins shall be no small matter.
:'''Raimondo:''' And since it is such an important matter, it is only natural for us to explain every detail to the one carrying out the work.
:{{DIcon}} Who am I escorting?
:'''Raimondo:''' Why that'd be Mr. Nacker, of course. Across the entire Institute, there's no one better suited than him to deal with the Central Laboratory ruins.
:'''Chronie:''' I request that I accompany Mr. Nacker.
:'''Choiseul:''' What? Uh, I think...
:'''Raimondo:''' ...This is a terrific proposal.
:'''Raimondo:''' Choiseul, did you forget what we mentioned when we came up with the plan? We must keep the public informed about the rebuilding of the Institute with the utmost transparency.
:'''Choiseul:''' Uh... that's right! The new Fontaine Research Institute has nothing to hide. Edwin made some mistakes, but we're past that now.
:'''Choiseul:''' Please go write report on it. Go to the ruins of the Institute and see the mistakes Edwin Eastinghouse made.
:'''Choiseul:''' Looking back again, the Institute now is just what we've been working toward, the cause we stand for! But allow me to emphasize once again that...
:'''Paimon:''' And here we go again... Paimon's about to fall asleep...
:{{DIcon}} I truly admire how much you guys have to say.
::'''Paimon:''' Not to mention how every sentence seems to magically make people fall asleep... Paimon's already feeling sleepy from just half a sentence...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe you should call me after you're done talking...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, this doesn't have anything to do with us &mdash; and this is a good time for a break, anyway.
:'''Raimondo:''' No, no, it's important business. So please, come this way...
:{{Black Screen|Under Raimondo's guidance, you sign many complicated documents. Thanks to your prior experience, you finish signing them before you know it this time...}}
:'''Raimondo:''' ...Alright, that should be all of them. Thank you, {{Traveler}}. You are now an Externally Contracted Assistant Researcher for the Fontaine Research Institute.
:'''Paimon:''' What about Paimon? Does Paimon get any title?
:{{DIcon}} You're my important assistant, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Assistant... Ugh, that just doesn't sound cool...
:'''Raimondo:''' Hahaha! Don't worry. Assistants play an absolutely critical role within the Institute.
:'''Raimondo:''' But let us get back to business, shall we? Things right now in the Institute are... rather complicated. The matters you'll be dealing with are also urgent, so I won't keep you for much longer.
:'''Raimondo:''' While you're on the way, Mr. Nacker will inform you of some things to note, as well as what you will actually need to do.
:'''Raimondo:''' The rest is up to you now. A lot rests on your shoulders, Mr. Nacker.
:'''Nacker:''' ...Well then, please follow me, {{Traveler}}. We must get to the ruins.
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing!
:'''Chronie:''' Don't forget me!
:'''Nacker:''' Yes, and you. How could I possibly forget you?

;(Talk to Choiseul or Raimondo again, optional)
:'''Choiseul:''' Raimondo, during our last meeting, did I really mention that we must keep the public informed about the rebuilding of the institute with the utmost transparency?
:'''Choiseul:''' I really don't remember that. Perhaps I should check for it in the meeting notes. Could you tell me what page it was exactly?
:'''Raimondo:''' If by "checking for it in the meeting notes," you mean you wish to see this point made in clear writing...
:'''Raimondo:''' Then I must say that it won't happen, as such a point cannot be summarized into a single sentence.
:'''Raimondo:''' This point was made based on the overall essence of that meeting, which was to first address morality and human relations, and the sum total of social norms...
:'''Raimondo:''' Lastly, this concept, when extracted from countless specific words and actions, is so broad and generic that anyone can see and comprehend its abstract concept.
:'''Choiseul:''' So what you're saying is, "I didn't say that?"
:'''Raimondo:''' Uh...
:'''Raimondo:''' Correct.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|After a long struggle with the Anchors, at last you pass the final review and may officially fulfill the commission and escort Nacker to the ruins of the Central Laboratory.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Nacker:''' Come on, {{Traveler}}, Ms. Chronie, this way.
:'''Chronie:''' ...So, you mean we're going to delve into this... this... uh, this patch of water?
:'''Nacker:''' That's right. With the help of this "allogravity-condensed water," we can ascend the ruins of the Institute safely and efficiently.
:'''Nacker:''' If you don't wish to do it that way, you may also go to the opposite bank and glide in from the highest mountain using a wind glider.
:'''Chronie:''' Forget it. I... I'm not that good at using a wind glider, and I'm not really... used to heights, either.
:'''Nacker:''' Very well. Now I'll go over a few things to keep in mind when it comes to allogravity-condensed water.
:{{Black Screen|Nacker details considerations when making use of said allogravity-condensed water.}}
:'''Paimon:''' So in a nutshell, it's the same as when swimming or diving.
:{{DIcon}} I feel like this is more "flying or diving."
::'''Nacker:''' I suppose you could call it "anti-gravity diving" if you had to.
:{{DIcon}} Diving in midair will be quite a novelty.
::'''Nacker:''' In that case, please do enjoy experiencing it for yourself.
:'''Nacker:''' Is everybody ready? Ms. Chronie, you can still back out now if you'd like, and simply wait here for us to return.
:'''Chronie:''' Reporters never back down. I'll be right behind you guys! I'll... try to, anyway...
:'''Nacker:''' Alright then, if you insist. Let's get going now.

;(Approach the Experimental Field Generator)
:'''Paimon:''' This... What's this large plate?
:'''Nacker:''' That's the Experimental Field Generator that Mr. Edwin developed.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Didn't it already blow up? It looks perfectly fine now.
:'''Nacker:''' The thing that exploded wasn't this machine but the Arkhium ore that powers its core driver, the Arkhium Kinetic Core.
:'''Paimon:''' This thing... Will it suddenly start moving by itself?
:'''Nacker:''' Relax. This big guy can't move now that it's lost its power supply.
:'''Paimon:''' But didn't Raimondo say that we needed to use it to make the ruins descend? If it can't move...
:'''Nacker:''' Only a part of it will be activated. The Tri-State Arkhium can only support its operation at half speed, but that should be enough to relieve the abnormal gravity state the Central Laboratory ruins are in.
:'''Paimon:''' Er... Paimon doesn't understand that at all...
:{{DIcon}} What do you need us to do?
:'''Nacker:''' Please follow me. The place where we will need to work is in the back.
:'''Nacker:''' Ms. Chronie, please stay here. Some areas in the back contain Insitute secrets, and you're not allowed to have any exposure to them.
:'''Chronie:''' I can see that "back" of yours from here. What secrets could be hidden inside?
:'''Nacker:''' I have no idea either. That's why you're definitely not allowed inside.
:'''Chronie:''' What nonsense!
:'''Nacker:''' Anyway, please wait here. If you take photos randomly, you might capture something related to Institute secrets.
:'''Nacker:''' For example... the, um... formula for the sugar-free berry-flavored Fonta. This new Fonta product is quite important to the Institute.
:'''Nacker:''' If you leak any information of it to the outside world, you'll need to undergo a one-month confidential investigation and must report to the Maison Gestion at the [[Palais Mermonia]] three times every day and be questioned...
:'''Nacker:''' Of course, you'll need to stop your journalistic work.
:'''Chronie:''' Hahaha, don't worry. Even if I get taken away by the Palais Mermonia for questioning, it will only be because I've uncovered the secret you're hiding.
:'''Chronie:''' I won't let myself be forced to stop working for a reason as absurd as leaking some Fonta formula.
:'''Nacker:''' I admire your work ethic. I hope everything goes well with your photo-taking.
:'''Nacker:''' {{Traveler}}, let's go. There's still work for us to do.

;(Talk to Chronie, optional)
:'''Chronie:''' Huh? What was Nacker doing...?

;(After defeating the meka)
:'''Nacker:''' Sometimes I really don't get why the Institute had to design the support clockwork meka to look like humans.
:'''Nacker:''' Just from the perspective of supporting research, hands and feet are far worse than tracking and multifunctional clockwork meka apertures.
:{{DIcon}} What's this rock?
:'''Nacker:''' Oh, this is the Arkhium that supplies energy to the Experimental Field Generator.
:'''Nacker:''' What restrains it is the energy supply device created by Mr. Edwin. See this here? This circuit connects to the Generator.
:'''Nacker:''' Of all the inert Arkhium we found, this one was the best in terms of purity and stability.
:{{DIcon}} And then boom it went.
:'''Nacker:''' That came down to Mr. Edwin. I trust that this wasn't the cause, or at least, it shouldn't take all the blame.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... I&mdash;It's not gonna blow up again, is it?
:{{DIcon}} When that happens, I'm gonna need you to take us to the skies, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't have super strength! But... if it really does blow up, then P&mdash;Paimon could give it a shot...
:{{DIcon}} When that happens, let's jump into the water below.
::'''Paimon:''' Jumping into water from a high place such as this is gonna hurt when we, y'know, "splash"!...
::'''Paimon:''' Worst case scenario, P&mdash;Paimon will tug on your clothes and help to absorb the impact...?
:'''Nacker:''' Hahaha, don't worry. Now that Mr. Edwin's not around, we're completely safe.
:'''Nacker:''' Alright, I'm about to use Raimondo's catalyst to transform this Arkhium into Tri-State Arkhium and activate that big fellow outside.
:'''Nacker:''' Then, these ruins should be able to safely land on the ground.
:'''Nacker:''' {{Traveler}}, could you please help me take some photos in the area? I need to use them as evidence for my work record.
:{{DIcon}} Didn't you just say taking photos wasn't allowed?
:'''Nacker:''' It's fine. These will be used for reference in the Institute and won't be distributed.
:'''Nacker:''' Unless you secretly keep a few for yourself... which I trust you won't do.
:'''Nacker:''' Oh, right, and when you're taking photos, please look for Ms. Chronie while doing so. I've got no idea where she's run off to... or where she's hiding.
:'''Nacker:''' I really don't want to start the Generator only to suddenly find a lady tossed into midair.

;(Talk to Nacker, optional)
:'''Nacker:''' Readings are normal... Looks like everything's fine, and we shouldn't come across any hiccups...
:'''Nacker:''' {{Traveler}}, once you're done taking photos, please go find Ms. Chronie.
:'''Nacker:''' I'll come to find you guys when I've finished making adjustments here.

;(Talk to Chronie)
:'''Chronie:''' How suspicious...
:{{DIcon}} What's suspicious? Show me too!
:{{DIcon}} Hi, Ms. Chronie!
:'''Chronie:''' Oh! {{Traveler}}, you gave me a fright. How are you able to walk around without making any noise?
:'''Paimon:''' You were just too focused! Speaking of it, you followed us all the way here. Have you managed to find anything?
:'''Chronie:''' Not really. Since Mr. Nacker said all that, I don't really want to get in trouble.
:'''Chronie:''' In the end, all I could take pictures of were these dilapidated houses, broken rocks, and a motionless machine...
:'''Chronie:''' I bet I would be able to take photos of a big scoop if I could fly in the air just like you can, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Why be a reporter if you can fly?
:'''Chronie:''' I was born to do this. It's the reason I exist.
:'''Nacker:''' I, too, am very sure of that, Ms. Chronie.
:'''Chronie:''' What? You're also able to walk without making any noise? Is this a new technology the Institute's developed?
:'''Nacker:''' Unfortunately, we don't teach walking courses. I've already completed all the preparations, in any case. {{Traveler}}, please take Ms. Chronie back to the Institute.
:'''Nacker:''' Once the Experimental Field Generator is activated, it will rapidly change the gravity in the surrounding area.
:'''Nacker:''' I've been through professional training, and I know what to do in this situation.
:'''Nacker:''' For your safety, it would be best if you stay away from here.
:{{DIcon}} And how are you going to get down?
:'''Nacker:''' You don't need to worry about me. Mr. Edwin taught me how to use the Generator personally.
:'''Nacker:''' No one in the Institute can control this big guy as freely as I can... Not even Raimondo.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Guess we'll have to leave it to a professional then. Be careful!
:'''Nacker:''' Go now. We'll meet again on the surface.

;(Talk to Nacker, optional)
:'''Nacker:''' ...This should be fine now.
:'''Nacker:''' Huh? Please take Ms. Chronie with you and go down quickly. I'll be activating this big guy in a moment.
:'''Nacker:''' Then, this troublesome matter will be resolved once and for all.
----
;(Talk to Raimondo)
:'''Raimondo:''' {{Traveler}}! You're back. How's the work coming along?
:{{DIcon}} Everything's going swimmingly.
:{{DIcon}} It's fine.
:'''Paimon:''' There are still some finishing touches that "ought to be left to a professional," so Mr. Nacker is still up there.
:{{DIcon}} I feel like I haven't really contributed that much...
:'''Raimondo:''' Don't say that. You're our safety rope! Without you, dear {{Traveler}}, how could we have dared let Mr. Nacker go up there by himself? It could be said that the trip was a brilliant success.
:'''Raimondo:''' There were other benefits as well. Ms. Chronie's managed to photograph some... thought-provoking images, that she would like to ask me about. And a few of those pictures should prove even more "interesting" for Mr. Nacker.
:'''Raimondo:''' Let's not talk about that for now. Come, let us take a photo together. Monsieur Choiseul will also need to present you with a certificate and an honorary title.
:{{DIcon}} Honorary title?
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, ooh, and what about Paimon? Paimon... will also get a promotion from assistant, right!?
:'''Raimondo:''' Uh, seeing as... you're {{Traveler}}'s companion, then I guess you could join in on the photo. As for the title...
:{{DIcon}} So there's no honorary title for Paimon, then?
:'''Raimondo:''' Honorary titles must remain limited in quantity and stay relatively rare. Otherwise, how would we get sponsors and support through awarding them?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... Alright then...
:{{DIcon}} Then allow me to award Paimon...
::{{DIcon}} The honorary title of "Best Companion."
::{{DIcon}} The honorary title of "Best Travel Guide."
::{{DIcon}} A super awesome title!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, just what kind of nonsense titles are those!&nbsp;...Hmph, we're already best buddies, Paimon doesn't need a title for that!
:'''Paimon:''' You better make {{Traveler}}'s really awesome!
:'''Raimondo:''' Of course. This honorary title is of the highest standing. Besides, haven't you also been promoted to Assistant to the Honorary Senior Researcher? Come on, let's get that photo taken.
:'''Paimon:''' An assistant's still an assistant, no matter how many words you put after it...
:'''Raimondo:''' Alright, let's take the photo. This is an occasion to remember.
:'''Raimondo:''' Monsieur Choiseul, you're...
:'''Raimondo:''' Ooh, looks like he's having a nice conversation with Ms. Chronie.
:'''Choiseul:''' ...Hence, this operation is a stepping stone to rebuilding the Institute. We can do it, and it is our duty to do so, as it has always been!
:'''Choiseul:''' As for the former site of the Institute, we will keep it preserved forever and rebuild it as the Fontaine Research Institute Safety Education Center.
:'''Chronie:''' ...I think I've just about had enough.
:'''Raimondo:''' I'm certain that everybody has benefited from your speech, Monsieur Choiseul. But now's the time to take a photo together with {{Traveler}}, wouldn't you say?
:'''Choiseul:''' Yes, of course! We must take a photo and mark this occasion with our dear Honorary Senior Researcher of the Fontaine Research Institute!
:'''Choiseul:''' Please give us a second, Ms. Chronie. This shouldn't take too long.
:'''Chronie:''' Oh, don't worry. It's not like the things you said just now weren't all cliches anyway.
:'''Chronie:''' Weren't you guys going to take a photo together? I just so happen to have a Kamera with me. Please go and stand in position.
:'''Chronie:''' I traveled a long way to get here, so please at least make it worth the trip, okay?
;(A cinematic plays)
:;(Cinematic ends)
:'''Chronie:''' Uh... was that an... explosion just now?
:{{DIcon}} What else could it have been...
:{{DIcon}} We're just taking a photo together. Is such a ceremonious greeting necessary?
:'''Choiseul:''' I... don't believe that was an explosion. All things considered, uh... it was probably a controllable...
:'''Paimon:''' That was an explosion! Paimon was nearly blown away just now. If not, what else could it have been!?
:'''Chronie:''' Mr. Choiseul! Could you please explain this to us. Was this something that you had anticipated?
:'''Choiseul:''' I... uh... I must say, you asked a... very good question, a very... excellent one... as... many people are wondering the same thing.
:'''Raimondo:''' ...The color of these bodies of water. Could it be that the condenser components are already in...
:{{DIcon}} Wait, Nacker hasn't come down yet!
:'''Raimondo:''' ...You're right, he hasn't returned yet.
:'''Raimondo:''' Let's not delay, {{Traveler}}. We need to go now.
:'''Chronie:''' Wait! I want to go too! The truth behind this explosion...
:'''Raimondo:''' Please do not act rashly, Miss Reporter. If you dip one of your toes into that water, you'll be saying goodbye to this world within a minute.
:'''Chronie:''' Don't scare me!
:'''Raimondo:''' Would you! Please! Just! Stay! Here!
:'''Raimondo:''' {{Traveler}}, according to your previous experience, the energy flow that remains in these bodies of water shouldn't affect you too much.
:'''Raimondo:''' Please get to the ruins as quickly as you can. I'll find my own way up, and I'll meet you there.
:{{DIcon}} Your own way?
:'''Raimondo:''' I have my ways. After the explosion, I was among one of the first up there to conduct disaster investigation and evaluation.
:'''Raimondo:''' Things at that time were much more complicated than they are now... Anyway, enough talk. Let's get moving. Hopefully, Mr. Nacker won't meet the same fate that Edwin did...

;(Talk to Chronie, optional)
:'''Chronie:''' ...How can I get up there? Also, will that medicine work?
:'''Chronie:''' But he said that as long as I touch it... And those pictures. Darn it... I need to think of a way...

;(Talk to Choiseul, optional)
:'''Choiseul:''' My goodness, was this also predicted? Oh my...

;(Talk to [[Chisseray]] if Step 15 of ''[[Treacherous Light of the Depths]]'' is active, optional){{Verify}}
:'''Chisseray:''' Sure enough... Not doing research any more was the correct decision...
:{{DIcon}} About Punched Tape...
:'''Chisseray:''' Punched Tape? Now? The Central Laboratory blew up again! Sorry, but before that's cleared up, I don't have any time to worry about that stuff...
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|Another explosion occurred at the ruins of the Central Laboratory, scattering numerous condensing components for the large Arkhium inhibitor into the waters around the premises. You and Raimondo are forced to venture back into the ruins to deal with the emergency...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh!? Why are there so many meka here? We dismantled so many of them last time, didn't we?
:'''Raimondo:''' It seems that the explosion just now caused that Arkhium to release another wave of energy, which awakened another batch of clockwork meka...
:'''Raimondo:''' Please do dismantle them, {{Traveler}}, and quickly, please.

;(Examine the Arkhium)
:'''Raimondo:''' It looks like the Arkhium overloaded, and that the cooling mechanism is also damaged. Nacker... What have you done here exactly?
:'''Raimondo:''' This was my fault. I didn't think that Nacker would still be unsatisfied, despite all the benefits I gave him...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Benefits? Wait a second...
:'''Raimondo:''' Why are you looking at me like that? Did he say anything to you?
:{{Black Screen|You tell Raimondo of your encounters with Nacker, and his attitudes toward various matters...}}
:'''Raimondo:''' Hmph... Sweet talk! Did he tell you guys, then, that it was people like him &mdash; Edwin's successors &mdash; who are reaping the benefits of this mess by stealing all kinds of information and selling it for a fortune?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... You guys are telling completely different stories. Paimon doesn't know who to believe anymore. If only he were here, then we could find out the truth. Paimon doesn't see him at all, though...
:'''Paimon:''' If he's not here, where could he have gone?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe he successfully escaped.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe he's already...
:'''Raimondo:''' I don't think he was killed at the very least... I'll explain why later. For now, though, we must stabilize this Arkhium as quickly as we can.
:'''Raimondo:''' The suppression system shut down, and the ore is presently in an excited state. That is what caused the explosion.
:'''Paimon:''' What caused the explosion? But this big rock doesn't look blown up at all.
:{{DIcon}} I don't understand...
:'''Raimondo:''' Alright... I agree that this is indeed quite difficult to understand. I'll explain it in simpler terms for you... I guess I have no choice now.
:'''Raimondo:''' The Experimental Field Generator that Edwin created is extremely powerful and can manipulate gravity... This I believe you know already.
:'''Raimondo:''' After the explosion, all the Arkhium in the institute shattered into fragments. Among these fragments, many of them could have turned into an excited state and triggered an explosion at any time.
:'''Raimondo:''' With the use of Gravity Fields... they were all restrained and gathered... beneath our feet.
:'''Raimondo:''' That explosion just before was a small one caused by a small part of Arkhium in the ruins that was affected by energy flow. I guess you could call it... a minor rehearsal of a third great explosion.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... huh? Then... this ruin is a...
:{{DIcon}} Super-huge, ready-to-explode piece of Arkhium!?
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;So you guys did all this... not because you wanted to retrieve assets, but because you were scared this place would explode again!?
:'''Raimondo:''' ...That's just one of the objectives of this operation. But right now, our priority is to retrieve the condensing components that fell into the water and restart the suppression device.
:'''Raimondo:''' There is also Arkhium inside those components, and the intense energy flow has likely caused... unpredictable changes to the water bodies.
:'''Raimondo:''' Forgive me, but I'm really not capable of retrieving them and installing them back on the inhibitor.
:'''Raimondo:''' Only you are capable of doing this, {{Traveler}}. Please, for the Court of Fontaine, and...
:{{DIcon}} Since it's urgent, I'll just get the job done first...
:'''Paimon:''' But once this is all over, you'd better explain everything clearly!
:'''Raimondo:''' If all goes well, I will tell you everything I know.

;(Talk to Raimondo, optional)
:'''Raimondo:''' Drat... The energy flow is too strong here. I need to take more medicine...
:{{DIcon}} About the real reason for the explosion at the Fontaine Research Institute...
:'''Raimondo:''' ...You are quite inquisitive, but now's not the time for a long conversation. Please go and retrieve the condensing components first.

;(Approach one of the marked locations)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why can't we get into this water body?
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like there's no other choice! Let's look around, maybe we can find another way...

;(Interact with one of the components)
;(Obtain {{Item|Arkhium Inhibitor Condenser Component}})

;(Talk to Raimondo)
:'''Raimondo:''' ...That Mr. Nacker really knows how to create trouble for others. Just like that boss of his, Edwin Eastinghouse!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
:'''Raimondo:''' We really can't catch a break here. Not only did the explosion break off the condensing components of the device, but it also destroyed the self-sustaining system of the inhibitor.
:'''Raimondo:''' I'm about to remove the two backup Pneumousia Cores in the Experimental Field Generator and use them to supply energy to the inhibitor.
:'''Paimon:''' Luckily this big fella can't move. Otherwise, we wouldn't even have time to run...
:{{DIcon}} It's just not moving right now, you mean.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, knock on wood! Don't say things like that! What if it actually starts moving?
:'''Raimondo:''' Don't worry, its main source of energy is that big chunk of Arkhium behind it.
:'''Raimondo:''' Although the Arkhium has transformed into an activated state, the explosion damaged all of the energy supply lines, so it's lost all of its energy supply...
:'''Raimondo:''' ...Huh? The Arkhium Kinetic Core should've been right here. Where did...
:'''Paimon:''' Um... Hold on, you said that the Pneumousia Cores were a backup energy source.
:'''Paimon:''' A&mdash;And isn't the activation condition for backup energy sources... the complete loss of energy?
:'''Raimondo:''' Oh. Uh oh...
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! This big guy's moving! Gah, Paimon knew it would from the start!
:'''Raimondo:''' Edwin, you scoundrel! What did you do to this thing!?
:'''Raimondo:''' {{Traveler}}, only you can turn it off now...
:'''Raimondo:''' But not to worry. There are only two Pneumousia Cores powering it right now, so it's only functioning at one-third of its full power!
:'''Paimon:''' That's easy for you to say. Paimon can barely fly like this! Be careful, {{Traveler}}!

;(After defeating the Experimental Field Generator)
:'''Paimon:''' It... it stopped...
:'''Raimondo:''' I knew you could do it! Quick, grab these two cores. Let's go hook up the power.
:'''Raimondo:''' Just like before, you go connect the energy source, and I'll adjust the device.
<!-- screen transition -->
:'''Raimondo:''' Finally, it's stabilized. The Arkhium has transformed into an inert state... We and the Fontaine Research Institute are safe, for now.
:{{DIcon}} But it seems there are ever more secrets.
:'''Raimondo:''' As for the things you'd like to know, I {{sic|will happy}} to answer. But... not right now.
:'''Raimondo:''' What I can tell you now, based on my hypothesis, is that... Mr. Nacker stole the Arkhium Kinetic Core and triggered this small explosion.
:'''Raimondo:''' But before explaining in too much detail, we should return to the Institute, and place the proper notation and partitions into this interlude.
:'''Raimondo:''' ...Or at the very least, we need to stop Miss Journalist from getting more deeply involved. The Arkhium Kinetic Core is connected to too many other matters, and we must handle it in complete confidentiality.
:'''Raimondo:''' So, I would like you to "cooperate" with my work.
:{{DIcon}} Cooperate with your work?
:'''Paimon:''' You... you're not saying to play along with your lies, are you?
:'''Paimon:''' The scarier something is, the more you should share it with others! Then, we can all work together to deal with it faster!
:'''Raimondo:''' I have my doubts about that, you two. Every matter has its own way of being dealt with, and in this instance, we must first call for silence.
:'''Raimondo:''' But I promise that I would never have you steer from your moral standards or demand that you... have the same standard of behavior as we do.
:'''Raimondo:''' All I ask is for you to remain quiet. You need not do anything else. You might be wondering why I would have you remain silent while telling you the truth.
:'''Raimondo:''' I'll just come out and say it now. Your coming here is the only good fortune that our Institute has had in nearly a hundred years.
:'''Raimondo:''' No matter what happens or what the cost is, we must maintain good relations with you. I'm sure Mr. Choiseul feels the same way.
:{{DIcon}} Is telling the truth also a "cost" as far as you're concerned?
:{{DIcon}} Is transparency something you'd consider a "cost" as well?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! You're only just telling us the truth now, which you should have done ages ago. Just what sorta "cost" is that?
:'''Raimondo:''' Dear {{MC|m=sir|f=lady}}, Paimon. Telling the truth honestly is, in truth, the greatest price one can pay.
:'''Raimondo:''' Let's go back. I ask sincerely for your understanding and to provide all... necessary cooperation.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|The Arkhium has finally been stabilized and the crisis resolved. You follow Raimondo back to the Fontaine Research Institute. As for Nacker's whereabouts and status, and the real reason why the institute handled the Central Laboratory the way it did... Should you tell the truth?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Choiseul:''' Ms. Chronie, everything we do is in the best interests of the people of the Court of Fontaine.
:'''Chronie:''' ...So what you're saying is that the Fontaine Research Institute predicted the explosion just now? Are you kidding? Do you think I'm a Gestionnaire? You can't hoodwink me that easily!
:'''Raimondo:''' I think Monsieur Choiseul has expressed himself clearly enough. The situation is still under control. The status quo of the Court of Fontaine will not be adversely affected.
:'''Raimondo:''' Now, allow me to make a statement explaining the events that really occurred.
:'''Chronie:''' That's enough, Mister! I don't believe you for a second!
:'''Chronie:''' {{Traveler}}, you should have seen everything, right? I'm begging you, tell me the truth!
:{{DIcon}} (Let's cooperate with Raimondo for now...)
::'''Raimondo:''' No need to bother {{Traveler}} anymore, Ms. Chronie. Allow me to explain the truth.
::'''Chronie:''' Don't even think of trying to get away with it, Mr. Raimondo. I saw the Arkhium with my own eyes. This explosion must have been caused by it.
::'''Chronie:''' Did you not repeatedly emphasize before, that all the Arkhium had been properly processed and disposed of? Just what are you hiding?
::'''Raimondo:''' I haven't hidden anyting. This explosion was always a "controllable hazard removal directional blast."
::'''Paimon:''' C&mdash;Controllable hazard... wait, hazard removal... What?
::{{DIcon}} Mind you all don't bite your tongues on that.
::'''Raimondo:''' It basically means to use small, controlled blasts to quickly remove Arkhium fragments.
::'''Raimondo:''' With the goal of activating the Experimental Field Generator as quickly as possible.
::'''Raimondo:''' But couldn't have imagined... that Mr. Nacker would steal the Arkhium Kinetic Core needed to start the Experimental Field Generator.
::'''Raimondo:''' Not only that, but he intentionally activated that large chunk of Arkhium, using it to draw our attention while he made his escape.
::'''Chronie:''' ...So, is that the ploy you came up with just now? To dump all the blame onto a researcher, who could be dead right now for all you know!?
::'''Chronie:''' I think what you really want to hide is that you are completely incapable of dealing with the Arkhium! The Arkhium is still a major threat to the Court of Fontaine!
::'''Chronie:''' Ridiculous! A person's life isn't something you can throw away to help spread your own lies!
::'''Raimondo:''' I have already told you the truth, Ms. Chronie... Please listen to a final word of advice.
::'''Raimondo:''' It takes only the slightest bit of effort to fixate on something, but it always takes more brain power to avert your gaze from it.
::'''Chronie:''' ...Enough. I won't listen to another word you say, nor will I dwell on this.
::'''Chronie:''' Your words, deeds, and all the facts concealed by the Institute will be reported on in the next issue of The Steambird. Good day, gentlemen.
::{{Black Screen|Ms. Chronie strides away from the Fontaine Research Institute...}}
::'''Choiseul:''' ...Thank goodness, that's finally over with... Oh, and thank you too, {{Traveler}}.
::{{DIcon}} I just did what I should.
::'''Choiseul:''' Ah, such humility. In this day and age, those who do what they should are already outstanding.
::'''Choiseul:''' You didn't make assumptions about whether something is good or bad based on your subjective thoughts. Instead, you... think carefully about what you do and say for the sake of the greater good! Truly an excellent person!
::'''Paimon:''' But... is this really okay? Paimon still thinks that we should tell everyone the truth...
::{{DIcon}} ...
::'''Raimondo:''' There's no need to bear such a heavy burden, dear {{Traveler}}. You only... cooperated, after listening to my repeated entreaties.
::'''Raimondo:''' I am a Senior Technician of the Fontaine Research Institute, and the responsibility for this matter falls squarely on me, and me alone.
::{{DIcon}} But Ms. Chronie said...
::'''Raimondo:''' She has already obtained the truth she wants for herself. I wish her well.
::'''Raimondo:''' But as for us... we still have much to be concerned about. For example, the whereabouts of Mr. Nacker, and the Arkhium Kinetic Core...
::'''Raimondo:''' Hahaha, but shouldn't we first give you a few awards as well, Monsieur Choiseul?
::'''Choiseul:''' Right, right! Let's take another group photo together. The one we took before had an... unseemly explosion in the background.
::'''Choiseul:''' This new photo must be decent enough to be worthy of your status as our Honorary Senior Researcher.
::{{Black Screen|Choiseul and Raimondo stand in the same position as before, and an Institute researcher takes a photo for everyone...}}
::'''Choiseul:''' Perfect! Look at us &mdash; a decent bunch of decent people!
::{{DIcon}} The ostentatious awards ceremony has finally ended...
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes we won't ever have to attend such a... pompous ceremony ever again...
::{{DIcon}} The scene just isn't explosive enough.
:::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Stoppit! No more exploding! Any more explosions and Paimon'll have nightmares!
::'''Choiseul:''' This certificate and trophy are for you. I'll post a copy on the Institute bulletin board later.
::'''Choiseul:''' *sigh* I hope our researchers will follow your example. On this path, we must strive to take the lead, overcome all obstacles, and put in 120% of our...
::{{DIcon}} I actually have more questions for you.
::'''Raimondo:''' Of course. I know what you want to ask. Even though your questions are all... um, extremely complicated, I'm willing to answer them.
::'''Raimondo:''' In any case, I believe we'll have more opportunities to work together in the future, Honorary Senior Researcher.
:{{DIcon}} I'll tell you the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
::'''Chronie:''' ...I'm all ears, my dear {{Traveler}}.
::{{Black Screen|You tell Chronie everything that has happened, from beginning to end, without omitting anything.}}
::{{Black Screen|About the large Arkhium and the Experimental Field Generator.}}
::{{Black Screen|About Nacker, who is missing and could be alive or dead, and about Raimondo's accusations of him having stolen the Arkhium Kinetic Core.}}
::{{Black Screen|And of course, what Raimondo cares most about, the Central Laboratory ruins that could explode again at any time.}}
::'''Chronie:''' ...I'm shocked. Mr. Choiseul, were you aware of this?
::'''Choiseul:''' I... Oh... Of course, I... Um, my goodness...
::'''Chronie:''' So the Fontaine Research Institute doesn't even have the courage to face their own mistakes? Just to cover up the fact that you couldn't deal with the Arkhium problem, you did absolutely everything you could...
::'''Chronie:''' What I find most surprising is that you even tried to trick {{Traveler}}, who has been doing their utmost to help.
::'''Chronie:''' You even wanted to use {{Traveler}}'s credibility to convince me that Nacker was behind all of these crimes.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh!? Chronie, did you really understand?
::'''Chronie:''' I completely understand everything, dear Paimon. Thank you for dropping such subtle hints for me.
::'''Paimon:''' H&mdash;Hints? Did... did we drop any hints?
::'''Chronie:''' Of course, I know that what the Institute really wants to hide &mdash; the fact that the Central Laboratory ruins can explode again at any time.
::'''Chronie:''' Or to put it another way, Arkhium is still a threat to the entire Court of Fontaine!
::'''Chronie:''' Ridiculous! A person's life isn't something you can throw away to help spread your own lies!
::'''Raimondo:''' I have already told you the truth, Ms. Chronie... Please listen to a final word of advice.
::'''Raimondo:''' It takes only the slightest bit of effort to fixate on something, but it always takes more brain power to avert your gaze from it.
::'''Chronie:''' ...Enough. I won't listen to another word you say, nor will I dwell on this.

::{{Black Screen|Ms. Chronie strides away from the Fontaine Research Institute...}}
::'''Choiseul:''' ...Thank goodness, that's finally over with... Oh, and thank you too, {{Traveler}}.
::{{DIcon}} I didn't do what you asked me to. I thought you would...
::'''Raimondo:''' You thought I would throw a tantrum at you and scold you for not doing what I said?
::'''Raimondo:''' My dear {{Traveler}}, since the very beginning, your job has only been to escort the researcher to the ruins for an expedition. What I asked you to do was above and beyond the call of duty.
::'''Raimondo:''' It would have been great if you kept your silence, as that would've saved us a lot of trouble in the future, yes.
::'''Raimondo:''' But it's not necessarily bad that you told her the truth.
::'''Raimondo:''' I believe that now that Ms. Chronie has gotten what she wants, she will not bother us again for the time being.
::{{DIcon}} She will tell the public everything.
::'''Raimondo:''' I believe she will do that. I hope the people of Fontaine will like the truth she publicizes.
::'''Raimondo:''' But as for us... we still have much to be concerned about. For example, the whereabouts of Mr. Nacker, and the Arkhium Kinetic Core...
::'''Raimondo:''' Hahaha, but shouldn't we first give you a few awards as well. Monsieur Choiseul, would you do the honors?
::'''Choiseul:''' Oh? Of course! That's right. I've already prepared everything. There's a certificate, trophy... and other forms of remuneration, too.
::'''Choiseul:''' But before that, let's take a group photo together. The one we took before had an... unseemly explosion in the background.
::'''Choiseul:''' This new photo must be decent enough to be worthy of your status as our Honorary Senior Researcher.
::{{Black Screen|Choiseul and Raimondo stand in the same position as before, and an Institute researcher takes a photo for everyone...}}
::'''Choiseul:''' Perfect! Look at us &mdash; a decent bunch of decent people!

::{{DIcon}} I actually have more questions for you.

::'''Raimondo:''' In any case, I believe we'll have more opportunities to work together in the future, Honorary Senior Researcher.

;(Talk to Raimondo, optional)
:'''Raimondo:''' Is there something I can help you with?
:{{DIcon}} Why do you think that Nacker is still alive?
::'''Raimondo:''' Considering the interests of the Institute and my personal point of view...
::'''Raimondo:''' I do, in fact, hope that both he and that Arkhium Kinetic Core were obliterated in that explosion.
::'''Raimondo:''' That would mean that the last traces of Edwin Eastinghouse's influence here would be gone for good.
::'''Raimondo:''' But like I said earlier, that explosion was actually a small-scale Arkhium fragment resonance.
::'''Raimondo:''' Moreover... most of the Arkhium fragments in the explosion radius were ore waste that have been fully depleted of energy.
::'''Raimondo:''' Logically speaking, even if a large Arkhium chunk had gone out of control, causing the ore waste to resonate, such a violent explosion should not have occurred.
::'''Raimondo:''' The only possibility is that someone specially collected Arkhium that has not been depleted from other areas and piled them here.
::'''Raimondo:''' They then overloaded that large Arkhium chunk on purpose to create an Arkhium resonance, so as to trigger an explosion to cover up certain traces that would've existed otherwise.
::'''Raimondo:''' Nacker has always conducted research with Edwin and has a good understanding of the nature of Arkhium. It wouldn't take him much effort to do something like this.
::'''Raimondo:''' Still, that's just my preliminary conjecture. As for what happens next... we'll need to wait for the research institute to conduct a more detailed investigation.
::{{DIcon}} But why did he steal this core?
::'''Raimondo:''' This Arkhium Kinetic Core is the most cutting-edge technology created by the Fontaine Research Institute to date.
::'''Raimondo:''' It wouldn't be a bad idea to sell it or use it in the development of another project, hmph...
::'''Raimondo:''' But considering his level of academic expertise... I would rather he sell this Arkhium Kinetic Core for a good price.
:{{DIcon}} About the Arkhium Kinetic Core...
::'''Raimondo:''' Before we discuss this further, I believe Nacker or Ms. Chronie must have mentioned something to you already.
::'''Raimondo:''' They must have told you that my research projects and those of Edwin Eastinghouse had some overlap.
::'''Raimondo:''' But this is not entirely accurate... In fact, this Arkhium Kinetic Core is the fruit of my joint research with him.
::'''Raimondo:''' In theory, if we constantly inject this kinetic core with enough energy, it can easily allow the Experimental Field Generator to run at full power...
::'''Raimondo:''' After creating this core, we both realized a problem. We could barely find any way to keep injecting it with enough energy to keep it at maximum power.
::'''Raimondo:''' Edwin and I tried powering it with a mixture of Pneumousia and Arkhium energy, or by connecting large numbers of Arkhium ores in series to create a super-powered group... but neither worked.
::'''Raimondo:''' That was the situation until we found that giant Arkhium... Although it was always in an inert state, Edwin and I were certain that this ore had unprecedented purity.
::'''Raimondo:''' We believed that with the right treatment, this ore could definitely output the large amount of energy we needed...
::'''Raimondo:''' But then Edwin and I had a disagreement. I offered a up a more conversative proposal, but he wanted... to solve the problem rather more quickly.
::'''Raimondo:''' You should know everything else that happened after that.
:{{DIcon}} About Edwin...
::'''Raimondo:''' He was a genius in the field of scientific research. It's no exaggeration to say that his talent was only second to our first director, Alain Guillotin.
::'''Raimondo:''' At the same time, he was an... inhuman monster.
::'''Raimondo:''' Nothing mattered to him other than his scientific research.
::'''Raimondo:''' Edwin was willing to do anything or pay any price to advance his research.
::'''Raimondo:''' He once told me that research results were the only remuneration he needed. He said:
::'''Raimondo:''' "I don't need any remuneration. To me, research itself is the best reward."
::'''Raimondo:''' However, even though Edwin was a pure researcher, the people under him were all experts... in furthering their own interests, that is.
::'''Raimondo:''' Some secretly sold research assets, some plagiarized research results, and some used his name to scam others.
::'''Raimondo:''' They ruined the Fontaine Research Institute's reputation, little by little.
::'''Raimondo:''' Like I said before, as long as his research could advance, Edwin wouldn't do anything about this.
::'''Raimondo:''' In this way, they used Edwin's name to take all the Institute's resources for themselves.
::'''Raimondo:''' The Institute could only continue to conduct detailed reviews on the personnel and funding of Edwin's project team. Mr. Choiseul led many of these review operations personally.
::'''Raimondo:''' However, in the mouths of such people, these actions were construed as bureaucratic arrogance and distrust of researchers.
::'''Raimondo:''' More and more conflicts took place between us... and no one knew how to resolve them.
::'''Raimondo:''' But now... those conflicts no longer exist.
:{{DIcon}} About the current situation...
::'''Raimondo:''' Haha, your question is not a technical one, but rather, an administrative one.
::'''Raimondo:''' I think you should ask Mr. Choiseul about this instead.
:{{DIcon}} Why do you think Nacker stole the core?
::'''Raimondo:''' Do you still remember me flipping through the pictures Ms. Chronie took in the ruins?
::'''Raimondo:''' There's one of Nacker working in front of the suppression device. It's quite blurry... but I'm quite certain that his actions are definitely not part of any operational procedure.
::'''Paimon:''' That doesn't really mean anything, though. Maybe... maybe a thief came flying across from the nearby mountain and stole the core?
::'''Raimondo:''' Heh, that's most definitely impossible. The energy flow of the Arkhium here is the best anti-theft measure there is. No ordinary person can withstand it.
::'''Raimondo:''' Besides, the timing of the Experimental Field Generator's activation is simply too perfect. It cannot be a mere coincidence...
::'''Raimondo:''' I have a preliminary conjecture. Nacker... or should I say, the one who stole the core likely removed the Arkhium Kinetic Core early on, activating the backup energy source.
::'''Raimondo:''' However, Pneumousia Cores are relatively inefficient energy sources, and they have to keep up a continuous output of energy to reach the activation threshold of this contraption here.
::'''Raimondo:''' Hence, this person intentionally activated that large Arkhium chunk, creating a modest, but rather noticeable explosion.
::'''Raimondo:''' This way, when the Institute sent someone to investigate, they would be certain to fix the Arkhium Inhibitor first.
::'''Raimondo:''' And by the time they realized that {{sic|theey'd}} have to go to the Experimental Field Generator to retrieve the backup energy supply, the Generator would have already finished charging.
::'''Raimondo:''' From a technical perspective, such a modus operandi is highly probable, and those within the Institute capable of doing this would only be Edwin, Mr. Nacker, and myself.
::'''Raimondo:''' I doubt Edwin had the opportunity to do anything to that effect... which leaves two remaining suspects. Myself, and Mr. Nacker.
::{{DIcon}} Maybe this was all your doing, then.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! You said that Nacker lied, but you've also been lying all along!
::'''Paimon:''' Maybe this was all just part of your plan, and you tricked us into escorting you here so you could grab whatever it was you wanted.
::'''Raimondo:''' Your accusation is not entirely baseless. After this, I will also apply for and submit myself to the Institute's credibility review.
::'''Raimondo:''' As far as I'm concerned, though, Mr. Nacker is the one more likely to have committed this act. If this really was his doing, then he should be the one with the most to gain from it.
::'''Raimondo:''' Even if I am listed alongside him as a suspect... his chances of being convicted are certainly greater than mine.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Raimondo:''' Bye. I hope you have a good day.

;(Talk to Choiseul, optional)
:'''Choiseul:''' Ah! If it isn't our Honorary Senior Researcher. Welcome!
:'''Choiseul:''' Can I help you with anything? Or have you come to help me with something instead? Hahaha!
:{{DIcon}} About the Institute's current state...
::'''Choiseul:''' Everything is good! It's better than ever! Now that that egomaniac Edwin is gone, the gang of thieves under him no longer exists either.
::'''Choiseul:''' More importantly, the Institute has a chance to be reborn!
::'''Choiseul:''' We can take off the shackles and burdens of the past to focus wholeheartedly on building our foundations once again &mdash; that is, to work hard for the well-being of all the people of the Court of Fontaine.
::'''Choiseul:''' I'm currently gathering some people and preparing a Code of Conduct for our organization.
::'''Choiseul:''' It will include principles on the use of funds, research asset management methods... and ethical standards that should be observed in scientific research and work.
::'''Choiseul:''' All research-related behavior at our Institute will have relevant rules and provisions.
::'''Choiseul:''' Ah... What a wonderful future! It's simply the best!
:{{DIcon}} Do you and Raimondo run things together?
::'''Choiseul:''' No, to be precise, we deal with affairs related to different areas.
::'''Choiseul:''' Raimondo is responsible for getting scientific work and research back on track, and I'm responsible for everything apart from that.
::'''Choiseul:''' For example, I'm responsible for arranging funds related to manpower, quarterly budget allocations, re-accommodating visitors, and getting rid of those journalists together with Raimondo.
::'''Choiseul:''' But our main goal remains the same &mdash; to rebuild the Fontaine Research Institute and work hard for the well-being of all the people of the Court of Fontaine.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Choiseul:''' You go and do what you need to do. The Institute will always welcome you!

:{{DIcon}} You seem... to be a bit flustered?
:'''Chronie:''' It's like this... Ever since I got back from the Fontaine Research Institute, I started writing my article.
:'''Chronie:''' I put everything I saw, heard, and felt into that draft.
:'''Chronie:''' Such as how the Institute had never completely removed the Arkhium, but instead restarted another Arkhium-related research project.
:'''Chronie:''' Someone who used to work under Edwin was sent to explore the Institute ruins, but lost his life in an explosion.

:{{DIcon}} A credibility review?
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't your paper believe your report was reliable?
:'''Chronie:''' No, the review didn't target any specific report, but me personally...
:'''Chronie:''' Simply put, the Fontaine Research Institute accused me of inserting my own subjective emotions into the report due to conflicts of interest with the Institute and spreading false information to the public...
:{{DIcon}} But... do you have a conflict of interest with the Institute?
:'''Paimon:''' She only took a few pictures of worn rocks and broken machines... What conflict of interest could there possibly be?
:{{DIcon}} Because you exposed their unethical practices?
:'''Chronie:''' They... They accused me of leaking the latest design in the Fonta line.
:'''Chronie:''' They insisted that some of the photos I took in the ruins revealed parts of the latest Fonta design.
:'''Chronie:''' They must thoroughly examine every photo. Until then, they won't withdraw the lawsuit and I must continue to be subject to the credibility review.
:'''Chronie:''' It's obviously a ploy to stop my article from going public... but I will not give up.
