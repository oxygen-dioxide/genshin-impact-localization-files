'''Sudabeh''' is an [[NPC]] located in [[Vimara Village]], [[Sumeru]] who first appears in the ''[[Aranyaka]]'' World Quest ''[[The Children of Vimara Village]]''. She is [[Kavus]]' younger sister, [[Iosaphat]]'s daughter, and [[Amadhiah]]'s granddaughter. Her mother's name is left unmentioned, but she is a researcher at [[Sumeru Akademiya]] who spends most of her time away from home.

Her dialogue changes as the player progresses through ''Aranyaka''. After completing ''Aranyaka'', following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player three [[Suspicious Curry Shrimp]].
