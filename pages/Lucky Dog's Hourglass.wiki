==Description==
Even time itself could not leave a wrinkle on the face of the happy-go-lucky boy known as Lucky Dog.<br />Lucky Dog had no family, let alone children of his own.<br />But in the course of his life of good fortune, he considered all he met as his friends and family.<br />As his life was nearing its end, he saw an hourglass with sand flowing down, as if counting down his remaining time.<br />He simply chuckled, took a slingshot, and shattered the hourglass.
