==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aratani:''' Should I do a special issue... Hmm, a serial release would be fine, too...
:'''Aratani:''' Ah, speaking of which, the books from "that place" in [[Ritou]] will probably arrive soon. I can use them as reference...
:{{DIcon}} Could I ask about a novelist by the name of [[Sumida]]...
:;(After completing {{tx}})
::'''Aratani:''' Sumida... Huh, speaking of that, I haven't actually seen her in a while.
::'''Aratani:''' She bade me a solemn farewell sometime back, saying that she was on her way out to travel, and that I should await her grand victory in the "[[This Novel Is Amazing!]]" contest.
::'''Aratani:''' Even though, you know, she hasn't actually finished a single novel ever...
::{{DIcon}} Not a single one?
::'''Aratani:''' Nope. Her logic jumps all over the place, and my standards are pretty strict, so her projects often wind up abandoned half-baked.
::'''Aratani:''' Still, I have rather high hopes for her. The stories written by such people tend to be the best.
::'''Aratani:''' I hope she can keep her promise, either way, and send a manuscript worthy of the grand prize to me as a souvenir of her travels.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Aratani:''' Oh, me? I work at [[Yae Publishing House]]. {{sic|I'm charge}} of the planning and promotion of all our projects.
::'''Aratani:''' Take the "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest, for example. It was I who proposed, organized, and set it up.
::'''Aratani:''' My boss [[Hiratsuka]] didn't approve of that originally. Not sure if it was because he was too much of a stick in the mud or didn't want to do more work...
::'''Aratani:''' Thankfully, I pushed harder and promised that I would complete all of the work myself. Only then did he contest become a thing in the end.
::'''Aratani:''' I mean, just look! Hasn't "This Novel Is Amazing!" become our most important project now? Every light novel reader pays rapt attention to the result of the contest &mdash; all thanks to me!
::'''Aratani:''' Actually, I have been planning for some new project recently. Just you wait and see.
:{{DIcon}} The books from what place in Ritou now?
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Aratani:''' Eh? You heard that? Well... Never mind. You're an outlander right? You should be able to understand me.
:::'''Aratani:''' Because of the [[Sakoku Decree]], it's getting harder and harder to get foreign books. But my job relies on creativity, so I have to learn new stuff, right?
:::'''Aratani:''' Therefore, I will secretly ask people who can enter and leave Inazuma to bring some new books from outside. If there are some confiscated books from Ritou, I will also tell them to smuggle them in.
:::'''Aratani:''' You have to keep this a secret for me. In exchange, I'll let you read the new books.
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Aratani:''' Well, I mean, my job relies on creativity, so I have to learn new stuff, right?
:::'''Aratani:''' That's why I often ask friends to send me new books from overseas. If there are some impounded books over in Ritou, I will also tell them to bring them in.
:::'''Aratani:''' You have to keep that whole "impounded books" business a secret for me, alright? In exchange, I'll let you read the new stuff next time.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Aratani:''' Yes, yes, that's how we'll do it... Oh, alright, goodbye.

===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aratani:''' Well, that's this problem solved. Next, we need to consider the next event... Should we increase the number of ways in which people can draw prizes...
:'''Aratani:''' Other than the festival, we can't afford to dilly-dally on any of our plans...
:'''Aratani:''' Ah, speaking of which, the books from "that place" in Ritou will probably arrive soon. I can use them as reference...
