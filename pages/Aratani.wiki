{{Dialogue start}}
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm001 aratani 01.ogg}} '''Aratani:''' (This is such a well-organized event! The venue's a little small, but the turnout is good, and the organizers seem to have taken care of all the details. I should take a leaf out of their book...)
{{Dialogue end}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aratani:''' Should I do a special issue... Hmm, a serial release would be fine, too...
:'''Aratani:''' Ah, speaking of which, the books from "that place" in [[Ritou]] will probably arrive soon. I can use them as reference...
:{{DIcon}} Could I ask about a novelist by the name of [[Sumida]]...
:;(After completing [[Through the Mists]]{{verify}})
::'''Aratani:''' Sumida... Huh, speaking of that, I haven't actually seen her in a while.
::'''Aratani:''' She bade me a solemn farewell sometime back, saying that she was on her way out to travel, and that I should await her grand victory in the "[[This Novel Is Amazing!]]" contest.
::'''Aratani:''' Even though, you know, she hasn't actually finished a single novel ever...
::{{DIcon}} Not a single one?
::'''Aratani:''' Nope. Her logic jumps all over the place, and my standards are pretty strict, so her projects often wind up abandoned half-baked.
::'''Aratani:''' Still, I have rather high hopes for her. The stories written by such people tend to be the best.
::'''Aratani:''' I hope she can keep her promise, either way, and send a manuscript worthy of the grand prize to me as a souvenir of her travels.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Aratani:''' Oh, me? I work at [[Yae Publishing House]]. {{sic|I'm charge}} of the planning and promotion of all our projects.
::'''Aratani:''' Take the "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest, for example. It was I who proposed, organized, and set it up.
::'''Aratani:''' My boss [[Hiratsuka]] didn't approve of that originally. Not sure if it was because he was too much of a stick in the mud or didn't want to do more work...
::'''Aratani:''' Thankfully, I pushed harder and promised that I would complete all of the work myself. Only then did he contest become a thing in the end.
::'''Aratani:''' I mean, just look! Hasn't "This Novel Is Amazing!" become our most important project now? Every light novel reader pays rapt attention to the result of the contest &mdash; all thanks to me!
::'''Aratani:''' Actually, I have been planning for some new project recently. Just you wait and see.
:{{DIcon}} The books from what place in Ritou now?
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Aratani:''' Eh? You heard that? Well... Never mind. You're an outlander right? You should be able to understand me.
:::'''Aratani:''' Because of the [[Sakoku Decree]], it's getting harder and harder to get foreign books. But my job relies on creativity, so I have to learn new stuff, right?
:::'''Aratani:''' Therefore, I will secretly ask people who can enter and leave Inazuma to bring some new books from outside. If there are some confiscated books from Ritou, I will also tell them to smuggle them in.
:::'''Aratani:''' You have to keep this a secret for me. In exchange, I'll let you read the new books.
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Aratani:''' Well, I mean, my job relies on creativity, so I have to learn new stuff, right?
:::'''Aratani:''' That's why I often ask friends to send me new books from overseas. If there are some impounded books over in Ritou, I will also tell them to bring them in.
:::'''Aratani:''' You have to keep that whole "impounded books" business a secret for me, alright? In exchange, I'll let you read the new stuff next time.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Aratani:''' Yes, yes, that's how we'll do it... Oh, alright, goodbye.

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aratani:''' Well, that's this problem solved. Next, we need to consider the next event... Should we increase the number of ways in which people can draw prizes...
:'''Aratani:''' Other than the festival, we can't afford to dilly-dally on any of our plans...
:'''Aratani:''' Ah, speaking of which, the books from "that place" in Ritou will probably arrive soon. I can use them as reference...

===Fabulous Fungus Frenzy===
====Dialogue Set #1====
''Available during [[Nilotpala Cup: Debut Match]]''
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Aratani near the stage)
:'''Aratani:''' Hello there, distinguished guests of Lady Yae and the Almighty Shogun.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Aratani:''' Eh? Have you seriously forgotten who I am?
::'''Aratani:''' I'm Yae Publishing House's planner, the de facto organizer of the "This Novel Is Amazing!" event. We've met before.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon... kinda remembers...
::'''Aratani:''' That's alright, I'm sure you'll remember me after this encounter.
::'''Aratani:''' After all, with this new experience, I'll be able to inject some incredible, never-before-seen creativity into Yae Publishing House's next event! I'll become a renowned planner... Ahh, I truly am spectacular!
:{{DIcon}} About your travel itinerary...
::'''Aratani:''' Right, the plan is to visit as many famous spots as possible.
::'''Aratani:''' I hear there are quite a few scenic places inhabited by all sorts of fantastic animals here in Sumeru, where inquisitive researchers and noble Forest Rangers alike come and go, along with those mysterious, dangerous, yet alluring mercenaries.
::'''Aratani:''' Writers should be able to find inspiration around every corner here.
::'''Aratani:''' I recommended that Lady Yae bring more writers here to gather materials for their work, but she replied, "Quality is far more important than quantity," and selected [[Souka]] at random after flipping through the list.
::'''Aratani:''' In truth, Souka hasn't published any successful pieces yet. But I added her to our backup roster because of her great writing skills and her ability to quickly become immersed in stories.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... so that's how Souka was selected... It does feel a little random, to be honest... But it fits Miko's style.
::{{DIcon}} Maybe Miko wants to try to personally train someone new.
::'''Aratani:''' Wow! That's a really accurate guess!
::'''Aratani:''' Lady Yae once said, "To discover a newcomer's potential while heading in the most interesting direction should be a unique experience."
::'''Aratani:''' Now, being that senior writers mostly have their own writing style and habits, a newbie might have an advantage when it comes to incorporating foreign elements into a novel.
::'''Aratani:''' Lady Yae is as insightful as ever! It would seem Souka really is the best candidate for the trip to Sumeru!
:{{DIcon}} About Yae Miko...
::'''Aratani:''' Mhm, you guys are more concerned with the whereabouts of Lady Yae after all.
::'''Aratani:''' Unfortunately, the schedule that Lady Yae put together for us only covers a few specific days. We're free to do as we wish in our free time.
::'''Aratani:''' Take me, for instance. I'm thrilled just looking through the details of the Beast Tamers Tournament.
::'''Aratani:''' As for what Lady Yae does during her free time... Well, that's personal. It's not something a planner like me would have the privilege of knowing.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, come to think of it, Miko isn't someone who would enjoy a packed itinerary.
:{{DIcon}} Have a good time!
::'''Aratani:''' You too! Good luck with your competition!
{{Dialogue end}}

====Dialogue Set #2====
''Available after [[Dual Missions: Progress and Probe!]]''
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Aratani near the [[Coruscating Potential]] stall)
:'''Aratani:''' That's amazing! Have you guys studied Fungi before? You two are beyond gifted if this is your first time. I mean, you guys just easily won three matches in a row!
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations to us.
::'''Paimon:''' Haha, (Traveler) really does pick up things almost instantly!
::'''Paimon:''' If Miss Aratani were to join us on our adventures, you'd be able to experience all sorts of new stuff, but you'd also see that we often only have a short time to adapt to those new things!
::'''Aratani:''' Really?
::'''Aratani:''' I always thought that people like that only existed in [[Junkichi|Junkichi's]] outlandish novels... I see now that I was wrong!
::'''Aratani:''' I won't make negative comments about Junkichi's "sudden increase in power" character trope ever again!
:{{DIcon}} Let's put that aside for now... Souka...
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, right. Miss Aratani is here walking around... but where's Souka?
::'''Aratani:''' Souka? She's feeling better. She said that she's planning the main arc of her new novel, but she still needs to find inspiration for the blanks in between the chapters...
::'''Aratani:''' So she went to find a local familiar with the area and is now planning her next journey.
::{{DIcon}} That's good.
::'''Paimon:''' Souka has overcome the negative emotions of her defeat. Whew... that takes a load off our shoulders.
::{{DIcon}} Isn't it the same with Miko?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah. Paimon hears that Miko would pound her opponents into the ground every single time! But knowing the way Miko does stuff, Paimon is sure she only showed a portion of her true power!
::'''Aratani:''' Here it comes – this is the part where you start buttering each other up!
::'''Aratani:''' Then my question would be "Then, who is the stronger one between the Traveler and Lady Yae?"
::'''Aratani:''' I'm only asking about their combat skill in this competition. Assuming that the two of you were up against Lady Yae, who would win?
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? How sudden! Paimon's drawing a blank...
::'''Paimon:''' It's no good to say we don't know... but it'd be disrespectful to say that we'd beat Miko... If we were to admit defeat, we'd be too soft... How frustrating!
::{{DIcon}} There's no point in comparing combat abilities.
::{{DIcon}} What's important is that we can get along with out companions.
::'''Paimon:''' T-That's right! Paimon almost let Miss Aratani trap us! Miko said herself that she was just here for the experience. All she wanted to do was to try out beast taming. There's no need for a question like that.
::'''Aratani:''' What a perfect answer! The "offend no one" strategy that presses the conversation forward with no way to turn back!
::'''Aratani:''' Is it that obvious that you guys are the chosen "protagonists" of this world!? Hmm... I'm starting to get excited! What performances do the two of you have lined up for Souka's newest novel?
::'''Paimon:''' Why is Miss Aratani acting so weird too? Has Souka passed her weirdness on to her...?
