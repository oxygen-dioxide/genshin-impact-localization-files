|text    = We just finished an important experiment. Whew... The next step is to await the results and hope for a breakthrough.

I'm not one to believe in luck, but when it comes to my birthdays, experiments tend to go well, while research you help with often sees good progress...

So... Uh... if you could make it...

Oh! Right! There's one more thing I'd like to ask you. Recently, as I was tidying up my lab, I dug up some heretofore unseen material from the back of a cupboard. I suspect that it was left here by someone else. Given how well-traveled you are, you might know something about it? The materials are enclosed. If you have any input, please... please let me know!

Thank you very much.
