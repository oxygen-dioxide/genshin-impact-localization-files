:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Rama:''' Oh, I've heard about cheating with scents before... But rest assured, I would never do that.
:{{DIcon}} About spices...
::'''Rama:''' Spices are essential for us Sumeru cooks!

::{{DIcon|Reward}} That good, huh?
:::'''Rama:''' Of course!
:::'''Rama:''' Well, have a try and you'll know.
