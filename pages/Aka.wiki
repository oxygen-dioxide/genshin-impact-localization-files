'''Aka''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPCs|NPC]] that appears in the cinematic of [[Taurus Iracundus Chapter]], Act I: [[Rise Up, Golden Soul]].

==Profile==
Aka is a representative image of the crimson [[oni]] race in the Inazuma fairy tales. He, along with his blue oni friend [[Ao]], tries to live in harmony with humans at the contract of [[Raiden Shogun]].

Aka's initial attempts to interact with humans ended in failure, but he still wished to befriend them. Ao proposed a solution in which he would perform "evil" acts and have Aka scare him off. The plan worked and Aka began to happily interact with humans. Seeing this, Ao left. Eventually, Aka searched for Ao; upon realizing that Ao was purposely avoiding him because Ao didn't want humans to misunderstand that Aka is corrupt too, Aka left behind a letter and they reunited during a village festival, albeit away from the village.

Nowadays, keeping that spirit, the descendant of crimson oni as [[Arataki Itto]] always tries to maintain good relationships with humans, obtain their respect, and not use strength for malicious intents. That crimson oni's will of chivalry and conscientious has also helped the forgotten [[Takuya|blue oni]] race to gradually come to light and receive better care of society.
