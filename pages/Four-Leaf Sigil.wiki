'''Four-Leaf Sigil''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Sumeru]]. They are four-petaled flowers that allow players to travel swiftly.

By aiming the camera at a Four-Leaf Sigil no more than 40 meters away, if the space between the player and the Four-Leaf Sigil is unobstructed, then the player can press the "Interaction in Certain Gameplay Modes" [[keybind]] or button to quickly travel in the direction of the sigil.

The travel cannot be canceled or exited partway. Players cannot use Four-Leaf Sigils while [[swimming]] or in a [[Waverider]].

When {{Dendro}} is applied to a [[Clusterleaf of Cultivation]], Four-Leaf Sigils will be scattered to specific locations. These Sigils will last for 24 real-world hours before disappearing.

Players can use [[Sorush (Gadget)|Sorush]] in [[Girdle of the Sands]] to move red-tinted Four-Leaf Sigils called [[Special Four-Leaf Sigil]]s. Normal Four-Leaf Sigils can also be spawned by activating [[Ruebright Bloom]]s or collecting certain [[Plume of Purifying Light|Plumes of Purifying Light]].
