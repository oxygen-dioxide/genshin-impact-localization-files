'''Attack Speed''', abbreviated '''ATK SPD''' or '''Attack SPD''' in in-game descriptions, is a modifier that alters the speed of a character's attacks.

Attack Speed bonuses come from both characters and weapons, and can be triggered by a variety of effects. Effects that "increase Attack Speed" increase the speed of [[Normal Attacks]]. Unless it is also stated elsewhere that they can increase Charged ATK SPD, these effects usually only affect Normal Attacks.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Others|Combat}}</ref>

Normal Attack Speed has a base of '''100%''' and a cap of '''160%''', any Normal Attack Speed buffs beyond the cap will not have any effects.

[[Movement Speed]] does not increase attack speed (or vice versa).
