:'''Melies:''' Well, how was it? My experimental style and "Special Lighting" are quite something, no?
:{{DIcon}} I was just getting into it!
::'''Melies:''' Ha, I knew you were up to the job!
::'''Melies:''' Filming action scenes clearly suits you like a suit.
::'''Melies:''' Feel free to drop by the studio anytime during the Film Festival to carry on filming, and immerse yourself in the limelight!
::'''Melies:''' I literally have an inexhaustible supply of film roll, so no matter how many cuts you want to film, be my guest!
:{{DIcon}} When will the film come out?
::'''Melies:''' Hard to say, to be honest...
::'''Melies:''' Even after you and your acting double have finished all the filming, I've then got to go through the whole process of editing, color grading, sound design, and more...
::'''Melies:''' I'm not even sure if it'll all be done in time to start officially promoting it and put out a trailer.
::'''Melies:''' But none of our work will have been wasted! Even if it all takes a day or two extra, when the film finally comes out, its quality will speak for itself!
::'''Melies:''' So please, have patience, my good partner.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'm off...
::'''Melies:''' Goodbye for now. Remember, when you get some time on your hands, please do pop into the studio for a bit of filming!
