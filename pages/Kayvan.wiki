==Profile==
Kayvan is an aspiring fisherman from Sumeru notable for his luck (or more accurately, lack thereof) when it comes to catching fish, and his corresponding talent at catching anything ''other'' than fish. On his fishing exploits, he has caught flotsam and jetsam from sunken ships, lost items and most notably, wet packages; it is stated that he has even failed to catch a fish even in a river full of fish. He initially proclaims himself the "Supreme Hookshot", but this is only a method to boost his ego; he later drops the moniker, even getting annoyed when the name is mentioned.

During his various attempts at catching fish, he meets [[Helbet]], an archivist with the [[Akademiya]] who has heard of his "abilities", requesting him to help her fish out "relics"; despite his continuous dissuasions, Helbet's continuous pleading results in Kayvan reluctantly helping her fish up relics, putting his "talent" to use. Despite catching items of use to Helbet, he is still unhappy as he is still unable to catch a single fish. Eventually, on Helbet's suggestion, he goes to a researcher who specializes in fishing to see how to improve his skill; even after seeing said researcher, he is still unable to catch fish, much to his grief.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kayvan:''' Life by the sea is relaxing, but there are still occasional dangers that should be treated with caution.
:{{DIcon}} Dangers by the sea...
::'''Kayvan:''' The shores of Sumeru are fraught with sea monster attacks, which often affect residents and fishermen who live along the coast and disrupt the merchant ships.
::'''Kayvan:''' Fortunately, we're all familiar with the situation at sea and know how to protect ourselves. Plus, with [[the Eremites]]' assistance, there haven't been any major casualties.
::'''Kayvan:''' The [[Akademiya]]'s researchers have gradually come here, too, to investigate the pattern of the sea monster attacks, thus improving the effectiveness of our defense.
::'''Kayvan:''' But just because the situation has improved, doesn't mean we can let our guard down. We must always watch out when near the sea and follow the instructions in case of an emergency.
:{{DIcon}} Understood.
::'''Kayvan:''' Alright, be careful.
