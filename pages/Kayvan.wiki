==Profile==
Kayvan is an aspiring fisherman from Sumeru notable for his luck (or more accurately, lack thereof) when it comes to catching fish, and his corresponding talent at catching anything ''other'' than fish. On his fishing exploits, he has caught flotsam and jetsam from sunken ships, lost items and most notably, wet packages; it is stated that he has even failed to catch a fish even in a river full of fish. He initially proclaims himself the "Supreme Hookshot," but this is only a method to boost his ego; he later drops the moniker, even getting annoyed when the name is mentioned.

During his various attempts at catching fish, he meets [[Helbet]], an archivist with the [[Akademiya]] who has heard of his "abilities", requesting him to help her fish out "relics"; despite his continuous dissuasions, Helbet's continuous pleading results in Kayvan reluctantly helping her fish up relics, putting his "talent" to use. Despite catching items of use to Helbet, he is still unhappy as he is still unable to catch a single fish. Eventually, on Helbet's suggestion, he goes to a researcher who specializes in fishing to see how to improve his skill; even after seeing said researcher, he is still unable to catch fish, much to his grief.

===Personality===
Kayvan is initially shown to be very haughty and self-centered, dubbing himself the "Supreme Hookshot" and proclaiming himself the best angler in Sumeru; he claims to be able to see things that other anglers are unable to see as well as making his own bait, claiming that he can catch "fish" that the Traveler had never seen before. His supposed confidence however is a ploy to hide his apparent inability to catch fish and boost his confidence, shown when he attempts to brush off his wet package as a "fish", later muttering under his breath that he hopes he'll catch a fish eventually.

Further encounters with Kayvan will cause him to drop the "Supreme Hookshot" moniker entirely, as he gets more and more dejected and exasperated with every of his attempts to catch fish, eventually declaring despondently that his fishing career "has come to its end" and even getting annoyed when his "Supreme Hookshot" moniker is mentioned.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kayvan:''' Life by the sea is relaxing, but there are still occasional dangers that should be treated with caution.
:{{DIcon}} Dangers by the sea...
::'''Kayvan:''' The shores of Sumeru are fraught with sea monster attacks, which often affect residents and fishermen who live along the coast and disrupt the merchant ships.
::'''Kayvan:''' Fortunately, we're all familiar with the situation at sea and know how to protect ourselves. Plus, with [[the Eremites]]' assistance, there haven't been any major casualties.
::'''Kayvan:''' The [[Akademiya]]'s researchers have gradually come here, too, to investigate the pattern of the sea monster attacks, thus improving the effectiveness of our defense.
::'''Kayvan:''' But just because the situation has improved, doesn't mean we can let our guard down. We must always watch out when near the sea and follow the instructions in case of an emergency.
:{{DIcon}} Understood.
::'''Kayvan:''' Alright, be careful.
