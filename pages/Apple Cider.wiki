'''Apple Cider''' is a [[food]] item that the player purchases from [[Charles]] in [[Angel's Share]] (located in the [[City of Mondstadt]])  for 1,500 [[Mora]] (max 2 per day).

Apple Cider restores '''26'''% of Max HP to the selected character and regenerates '''570''' HP every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].
