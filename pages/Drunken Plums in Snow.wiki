|description     = An elegant-looking Liyue dish.
|desc_suspicious = The final presentation seems flawless, but hidden within the carefully disassembled crab meat are small, unnoticed fragments of shell. Before indulging, one must overcome a sense of unease, as there's always the risk of your teeth meeting a shard of hard chitin...
|desc_basic      = Once the crab is steamed, its roe and meat are carefully removed, stir-fried, then returned to the shell. Egg whites are whipped into a frothy coating to seal the crab shell, topped with finely chopped ham for a touch of color, then the whole thing is baked. Together, the succulent crab meat and fluffy egg whites make a combination that's sure to impress.
|desc_delicious  = The snow-like coating is soft and airy, like snowflakes gently falling onto your tongue. Then, the rich, fresh crab meat quickly envelops your taste buds, like radiant, resplendent plum blossoms blooming amidst the lonesome, serene snowfall, captivating and enchanting.
