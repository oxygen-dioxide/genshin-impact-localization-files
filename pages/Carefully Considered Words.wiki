|description    = A fully furnished study complete with items selected for the Speaker's Chamber and inspired by the decor of the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. The warm light from the desk lamp helps create an atmosphere well-suited to solitary contemplation and study. The name "Speaker's Chamber" implies a place for conversation and discourse, yet every word there spoken affects Natlan's fate. Each utterance must be weighed carefully, and there could be far worse places to consider a statement yet to be made than the tranquil confines of this study...<br>This Furnishing Set is favored by the following companions: Chasca, Mavuika
