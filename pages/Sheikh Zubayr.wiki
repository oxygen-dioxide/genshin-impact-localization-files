''Available before completing [[Nilou]]'s [[Lotos Somno Chapter|Story Quest]] Act I: [[To the Wise]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Hello. If you're here for an interview. I'll have to refuse.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' I'm a playwright and manager. I run the Zubayr Theater in this tree hollow.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' In addition, I also do some composing, choreography, stage design, and action direction.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' It's a small troupe. Pretty much everyone other than [[Kourosh]] wears several hats.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' So if it isn't about anything important, I'll have to ask that you not bother the staff here, including myself.
::{{DIcon}} About Kourosh...
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Him, he's a man of mediocre talent. His movements on stage are stiff and his singing is less in tune than [[Swoof]]'s.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' His only strength is his determination. To this day, he still hasn't given up his job as an actor.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' I'm a person with high standard, but I don't give up on persistent students. As long as he can still accept criticism, I'll continue to instruct him.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' After all, I can't expect everyone to be as gifted as [[Nilou]].
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Ah, that reminds me, I still have more to discuss with him regarding the lines of the new script...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Bye.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Nilou]]'s [[Lotos Somno Chapter|Story Quest]] Act I: [[To the Wise]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Ah, it's you. Welcome, welcome!
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Sheikh Zubayr/Duel: Sheikh Zubayr|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' You lost, now leave. I still have a lot of things to do.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' ...I've got work to do. Okay. Don't bother me unless it's an emergency.
:{{DIcon}} How have things been going for you recently?
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Well, quite the same as always. I am the resident playwright and manager, and so I am... managing, haha!
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' We are a rather small troupe, so pretty much everyone other than Kourosh wears several hats. I also do some composing, choreography, stage design, and action direction on the side.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' However, we have had new joiners recently, which has given me some time to focus on something... And of course, one can't complain about the added bustle.
::{{DIcon}} About Kourosh...
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Him, he's a man of mediocre talent. His movements on stage are stiff and his singing is less in tune than Swoof's.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' His only strength is his determination. To this day, he still hasn't given up on being an actor.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' I'm a person with high standards, but I don't give up on persistent students. As long as he can still accept criticism, I'll continue to instruct him.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' After all, I can't expect everyone to be as gifted as Nilou.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Ah, that reminds me, I still have more to discuss with him regarding the lines of the new script...
:{{DIcon}} How are Nilou and [[Inayah]] doing?
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Nilou is teaching her to dance as we speak. However, I must say that it hasn't been easy. Dance is something that is best learned from young, I fear.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Still, Inayah works so hard. Beyond the tasks that Nilou sets her, she trains independently as well.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' I daresay that with her current progress, she may be good enough to take the stage in but a few years.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' I daren't imagine, however, how many times longer that period would have been without the tutelage of someone as gifted and patient as Nilou.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Do come again.

==Trivia==
* A "sheikh" is a title of honor given to a man in the Arab world, typically one who is a leader or respected elder in his community. It is often used to refer to a tribal leader, religious leader, or a leader of a clan or family. In some cases, the title can also be given to a learned or distinguished person.
** This may explain why he can afford to fund, manage, and maintain his own theater.

===Etymology===
* "Sheikhzubayr" is a pun on {{w|William Shakespeare|Shakespeare}}.
** The name likely originates from an obscure theory that Shakespeare was actually an Arab writer by the name of [https://margaretlitvin.com/2011/04/05/qadhafi-shakespeare-was-an-arab-named-shaykh-zubayr/ Shaykh Zubayr].
