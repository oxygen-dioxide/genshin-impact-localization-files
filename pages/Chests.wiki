'''Chests''' in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' are objects that can be found around the world of [[Teyvat]] and as rewards for completing certain [[domains]].

Opening chests usually rewards the player with [[Primogem]]s, [[Adventure EXP]], [[Sigils]], [[Mora]], and a random assortment of [[Weapons]], [[Artifacts]], and [[Character EXP Materials]]. There are also [[Achievements]] that are granted upon opening a certain number of chests within a region.

Treasure Compass [[gadgets]] can be used to search for chests within their respective regions, with some exceptions. (For example, [[Anemo Treasure Compass]]es cannot be used within the [[Dragonspine]] region.) The blueprints for these gadgets are obtained as a reward for reaching [[Reputation]] level 6 in [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]] and level 9 in [[Inazuma]].

==Types of Chests==
There are five types of chests: Common, Exquisite, Precious, Luxurious and Remarkable.

They can reward various items, including {{Item|Primogem|25|text=Primogems}}, {{Icon/AR EXP|25}} [[Adventure EXP]], {{Item|Mora|25}}, {{Item|Anemo Sigil|25|text=Sigils|link=Sigils}}, [[Character EXP Materials]], [[Weapon Enhancement Materials]], [[Weapons]], and [[Artifacts]]. For more information, see the [[#Chest Rewards|Chest Rewards]] section.

Additionally, some chests are hidden and have to be dug up from the ground. These are marked with either a shovel or some other sign. [[Treasure Hoarders]] are also an indicator of a hidden chest. When walking near their location, the option to "Dig" will appear, and then the chest will appear.

Some chests are encased in [[Dendro Vines]], which have to be burned with Pyro to access. Others are encased in rocks, which have to be destroyed (e.g. via [[Claymore]], [[Geo]], or [[Plunging Attack]]s) to access.

Confirmed locations of common chests giving 2 {{Icon/Primogem|25}} include the Stormbearer Mountains, [[Dragonspine]], [[Inazuma]], the ''[[Alcor]]'' off the coast of Liyue, and in [[The Chasm]].

==Additional Information==
* Certain daily commissions will despawn chests. The chests will then spawn back when re-exploring the area.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jokxcb/daily_commission_quests_in_some_areas_will/ Daily Commissions Will Cause Some Chests to Despawn Temporarily]</ref>
* All chests are present in Teyvat the moment the game starts.
* Certain chests will disappear and reappear on certain days.
* Some common chests are covered in rock or thorns, which require Heavy attacks (from Claymore hits, Geo attacks or explosive abilities) and Pyro attacks respectively to become accessible.

===Discovering Hidden Chests===
While many chests are exposed, and can be located through the usage of a [[Treasure Compass]], certain chests will be hidden from the player and must be revealed through various methods.

* Guiding [[Seelie]]
* Killing [[monsters]]
* Time Trials and challenges
* Popping floating [[Anemo Slime]]s
* Popping [[Bloatty Floatty|Bloatty Floatties]]
* Standing on specific spots
* Digging at specific spots (often marked with a shovel or a sign)
* Picking up [[Carrot]]s from the ground in [[Mondstadt]]
* Lighting torches, campfires, etc.
* Activating [[Windmill Mechanism]]s and [[Elemental Monument]]s
* Creating Geo constructs in certain locations and on top of [[Pressure Plate]]s
* Destroying piled rock monuments
* Destroying pillars of rocks in [[Liyue]]
* Using Pyro or Anemo to clear away piles of dirt (leaves)/Dendro elements
* Defeating disguised [[Whopperflowers]]
* The 10 large ambers found on [[Mt. Hulao]] can all spawn 1 chest each. They appear to spawn randomly, so players must return to the location once the ambers reset.

==Achievements Counters== 
Within the game's [[achievements]], some of them contain information on the amount of chests opened by region. The highest known numbers for those achievements are: '''523''' in [[Mondstadt]], '''1134''' in [[Liyue]], '''234''' in [[Dragonspine]], '''731''' in [[Inazuma]], '''185''' in [[Enkanomiya]] and '''248''' in [[The Chasm]]/[[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. The chests counted on the counters are only those found in the open world in [[Teyvat]]. Chests that can be found in temporary quest locations, such as the Cathedral in [[Venti's New Plan]], or in [[Domains]] are not counted for the chest opening Achievements.

===Bugs===
Over the course of updates, many bugs were found and fixed regarding chest counters:

* Before the 1.1 update, some chests encrusted with ice, rock or vines did not count towards the counters. Those who collected chests at this time have affected [[Liyue]] counters, with values ​​between 1055/1117 (excluding chest values ​​obtained from events).
* Before the 1.2 Update, some chests were randomly counted in both regions, [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]], causing an inconsistency in the count between the values ​​discovered by the players. This happened between the [[Bishui Plain]] and [[Windwail Highland]] regions. Whoever collected all the chests at this time have their counters between 518/1117 and 521/1114 (excluding chest values ​​obtained from events). '''It is not possible to get the maximum values ​​of chests in Mondstadt and Liyue counters at the same time due to this bug.'''
* There are still some chests from one region that count for another (Liyue chests that count for Mondstadt), And some chests that don't count for any region. However, doing all chests routes will guarantee the current count of exploration chests values.

===Current Count ===
Today the counters have their respective values ​​for each region:<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/3639745 Max Chest Counts in Achievements and Battle Chronicle]</ref>

==HoYoLAB Chests==
It is possible to track the amount of Chests collected during the game through HoYoverse's official forum: [https://www.hoyolab.com/ HoYoLAB].
These are the highest values of each type of chests found until this moment. 3,671 unique Chests counted to HoYoverse's official forum.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
!Type!!Luxurious Chest!!Precious Chest!!Exquisite Chest!!Common Chest!!Remarkable
|-
!Amount
|139|| 369||1318 || 1799||46
|}

It is important to remember that:
* Chest count in the forum includes all Chests in the game, be they from open world [[Teyvat]], from [[World Quests]], [[Domains]] and limited duration [[Events]].
* The Chests of some domains cannot be collected after the quest that grants access to this domain is completed.
* There are some profiles with values above 139 Luxurious Chests. This is due to a bug in Bennett's hangout mission, where you can repeat the mission as many times as you like and the counter will count each time you open the Luxurious Chest. (This bug is already fixed and the Luxurious Chest no longer counts in HoYoLAB.)<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/3763261 Chest Bugs for Battle Chronicle]</ref>

===Time Limited Chests===
Some chests are available for a certain time limit within the game. After this time, they could no longer be collected. These chests counted towards HoYoLAB records in its Summary section.
* 15 Chests (3 Luxurious, 9 Precious, 3 Exquisite) from [[Lantern Rite]] event in the mission [[Beneath Splendent Lanterns]]. These chests were only available in the [[Version 1.3]].
* 138 Chests (6 Luxurious, 10 Precious, 58 Exquisite, 64 Common) from [[Midsummer Island Adventure]]. These chests were only available in the [[Version 1.6]].
* 48 Chests (16 Exquisite, 32 Common) from [[Labyrinth Warriors]] event. These chests were only available in the [[Version 2.2]].
* 4 Chests (4 Exquisite) from [[Shadow of the Ancients]] event. These chests were only available in the [[Version 2.2]].
* 125 Chests (6 Luxurious, 15 Precious, 32 Exquisite, 72 Common) from [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]]. Only 3 precious chests counted towards the HoYoLAB records. These chests were only available in the [[Version 2.5]].
* 253 Chests (8 Luxurious, 21 Precious, 94 Exquisite, 130 Common) from [[Summertime Odyssey]], of which 182 Chests will also be counted in the Event Review section. Only 12 Exquisite and 14 Common chests did '''NOT''' count towards the HoYoLAB records. These chests were only available in the [[Version/2.8|Version 2.8]].

==Investigation Points==
{{Main|Investigation}}
Investigation points can be found throughout villages, Treasure Hoarder encampments, and in other places throughout the world attached to objects such as barrels or abandoned carts.

They drop low value items, including a small amount of [[Mora]] {{Icon/Mora}} and relevant items (for example, barrels often drop [[Cooking Ingredients]], while Treasure Hoarder caches drop low-value [[Artifacts]]). Unlike chests, investigation points will respawn, tied to the [[Reset|server reset time]].

While not technically chests, these investigation points do trigger the healing effect of the [[Adventurer]] [[Artifact Set]], and therefore bear mention here.

==Trivia==
* Crude Chests were a type of chest only found in the [[Favonius Cathedral]]'s basement (which is accessible in the quest [[Venti's New Plan]]), but they were replaced with Common Chests in or before [[Version 1.2]]. They dropped 500 [[Mora]] and 1 [[Wanderer's Advice]].
