''Available after completing [[Dual Evidence]].''
:'''Soheil:''' (Why didn't I meet such a good guide back then?)

''Available after giving Soheil a slate.''
:'''Soheil:''' (I'd really like to go to the place where these slates were unearthed.)

''Available after completing [[Soheil's Wish]].''
:{{A|VO Soheil All Schemes to Know 01.ogg}} '''Soheil:''' (Can't let anyone damage the ruins...)

==Dialogue==
:'''Soheil:''' Young scholars are so impetuous these days...
:{{DIcon}} Still all hot and bothered over here?
::'''Soheil:''' Why, yes! And what do I have to blame for that, but young researchers continuing to try to worm their way into the desert?
::'''Soheil:''' Thanks to them, Hulwani and I have to do a few rounds around this place every single day. The heat's turning my legs to jelly over here &mdash; and I haven't had any time to really look into the stone slates you brought back. For shame!
::'''Soheil:''' *sigh* When can I get back to the Akademiya...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Soheil:''' See you. May you have safe travels.
