{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, have you seen [[The Steambird]]? It seems [[Fontaine]] has been celebrating some kind of festival recently. Things are looking pretty lively in the square, they even changed the banners!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, there are a lot of people holding [[Kamera]]s... Oh, and they've got candy and snacks, too! Looks like everyone's having a good time!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go have a look for ourselves!

;(Approach the plaza)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' ...Seriously!? But Mr. Morris, I don't understand, sir! How can you only be telling me this now!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 morris 01.ogg}} '''Morris:''' *sigh* I'm afraid that there's really nothing I can do. I'm really facing a crisis, my hands are tied!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' But what about my film!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 morris 02.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Well... I'm afraid you'll have to come up with something on your own. Take it from me, sometimes you just have to let things go. The same goes for this film festival...
:;(Morris leaves as Xavier, and the Traveler and Paimon in the distance, look on. Xavier then despondently hangs his head.)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, isn't that Xavier? So he's back in Fontaine now.
:;(The two approach Xavier)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xavier!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 04a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 04b.ogg}}--> '''Xavier:''' Ooh! Why, if it isn't the dear {{Traveler}} and Paimon! I really didn't expect to bump into you here at this time...
:{{DIcon}} It's been a while.
:{{DIcon}} How have you been?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Well, I was doing just fine... until I received some terrible news just now. The investor I was working with for my upcoming film has fallen upon some hard times, and is no longer able to provide the promised amount of funds...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can't you just find a different investor?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Unfortunately, that's not how it works... We had signed an agreement specific to the [[Fontinalia Film Festival]], stipulating that I cannot work with any other investors until the festival has finished.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Fontinalia Film Festival? What's that?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 07.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Oh, is this your first time participating in Fontaine's Fontinalia Film Festival? Then allow me to fill you in.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 08.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The Fontinalia Festival was established to commemorate the legendary [[Lochknight]]s who went on a quest to search for the [[Oceanid]]s, and eventually welcomed the Hydro Archon [[Egeria]].
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 09.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The holiday is deeply connected to the founding of Fontaine as well as its unique laws and trials. It's one of the most important festivals for this nation.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But what's with that weird expression on your face? It's like you're trying really hard to remember something...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 10.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Ah, I was just trying to recall the exact description from the books. In order to avoid any... uh, unnecessary arguments over semantics, I usually try to recite things straight from the source.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, either way, Paimon thinks she gets it now! It's just like the [[Windblume Festival]] in [[Mondstadt]] and the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]] in [[Liyue]]!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 11.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Yes, those are festivals of a similar variety! Who doesn't like a good festival? And just like those of other nations, Fontaine will hold a plethora of events around this time each year.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 12.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' To commemorate the Lochknights, people will imitate them by putting on special costumes, raising golden cups, and going door to door asking for pure water.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 13.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' But a few years ago, Lady [[Furina]] started to find the whole idea a little drab, and so decided to change the part about pure water to sweets.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That really doesn't surprise Paimon at all...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 14.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The whole thing seems more akin to a carnival now, and it's quite popular among the kids. Every year, you can hear a bunch of them saying, "Trial or treat!"
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that sounds pretty fun! But how does that connect back to the Film Festival you mentioned?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 15.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Ah yes, it appears I've strayed off-topic... I just got too excited after seeing you. Let me get back to the point.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 16.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The Fontinalia Film Festival is an event proposed by the Fontaine Film Association this year. Now that film technology has matured as a medium, it's the perfect time to introduce more people to the art form.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 17.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' During this time, people may submit films to be evaluated, and the entry with the highest score will be given the "Furina Award" by the association.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The what award?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 18.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The Furina Award. You know, after the Hydro Archon? They coined it while Lady Furina was still in power, but uh... Even though things have changed, no one has made any motion to update the name.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 19.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Perhaps everyone still thinks of it as a pretty appropriate name. Even though she isn't the Hydro Archon any longer, Lady Furina is still Fontaine's superstar. Anyone with eyes can see the way she shines on the stage.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, alright... Guess the name does work pretty well when you put it that way...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 20.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' *sigh* But who would've guessed there would be an issue with the funding... How will I ever explain this to Miss [[Chiori]], not to say all the other actors who traveled all the way here from [[Inazuma]]?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chiori? Sounds familiar... Where have we heard that name before?
:{{DIcon}} She runs the clothing store in the Court of Fontaine...
:{{DIcon}} [[Chioriya Boutique]]...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 21.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Yes, that's her! I asked her to oversee the event's art direction, including the design of the actors' costumes and appearances.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon remembers now! [[Navia]] said that her clothes were designed by Chiori! And [[Kirara]]'s outfit, too!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 22.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' How to describe her... Uh, well, she tends to be pretty direct, and can be very forceful when it comes to dealing with people. The fashion world in Fontaine has dubbed her "The Thundering Seamstress."
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 23.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Her remarkable designs have led many Fontainians to become very interested in Inazuma.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 24.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Anyway, Chiori is acquainted with all the actors I've invited from Inazuma. Without her help, I don't think I would have been able to get such an international cast for the film. She really is a kind soul.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who are the actors from Inazuma? Do we know them?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 25.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Why don't the two of you accompany me to the [[aquabus]] station to welcome them?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 2 xavier 26.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Judging from the time, the aquabus should be arriving shortly. Chiori will be waiting to meet me there as well.
----
;(Approach Chiori at the Clementine Line in the [[Court of Fontaine: Court Region Waterway Hub|Court Region Waterway Hub]])
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Uh, Miss Chiori...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Your talk with the investor sure went fast. The aquabus hasn't even arrived yet.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 02b.ogg}}--> '''Chiori:''' Oh? And who are they?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Ah, allow me to introduce you. This is {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Pleased to meet you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Likewise! We've heard the owner of Chioriya Boutique is a skilled seamstress, so it's a real pleasure to finally meet you in person!
:{{DIcon}} The way Navia's wardrobe comes together is really exceptional.
::{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 04a 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Why, thank you. I strove to create an outfit that matched her high social station as the Demoiselle.
:{{DIcon}} The concept behind Kirara's outfit is really original.
::{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 04b 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Thank you. I just wanted to make sure she wouldn't always look like a cat that had been unceremoniously dropped in a bucket of paint.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' So tell me, what happened? I can tell the conversation didn't go quite as expected.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Ah... Well, it's like this...
:;(Xavier explains the situation)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I know! I know, Chiori, you don't have to say it. You did remind me that this investor was a little bit sketchy.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yes, there's no doubt about that.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' But how could I pass it up... He offered me twice as much as the others.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And therein lies the problem.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Yes, but just put yourself in my shoes. After obtaining such an excellent script, it's only natural that I would want to make the most of the film.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 07.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The budgets that the others had proposed were nowhere near enough. It's difficult to find someone willing to front such a large amount of Mora, so...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't be sad, Xavier. We might be able to help scrounge some Mora together for you!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 08.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Thank you, Paimon. That means a lot to me. But the cost of the film is staggering... I'm afraid that any Mora we can "scrounge" together in a short amount of time won't even be able to cover the actors' fees...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We need to move on. What's happened has already happened, and there's no changing it, but now's not the time to give up.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 09.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' What? You're saying that... you have a plan?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No, that's not what I mean. I'm simply saying I wouldn't give up just yet.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' The actors I recommended aren't just after Mora, after all.
<!-- black screen transition -->
;(Meanwhile, on the aquabus)<!--forced autoplay while on aquabus-->
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' ...Really!? Then where do you live?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 aeval 01.ogg}} '''Aeval:''' We [[Melusine]]s live in [[Merusea Village]]. The only way to enter is from underwater!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Whoa, then you must be pretty tired after work every day, right? I mean, you have to swim all that way just to go home.
:{{Introductory Note|Yoimiya}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 aeval 02.ogg}} '''Aeval:''' You're so thoughtful! But some Melusines choose to live in the Court of Fontaine because it's so much more convenient.
:;(The aquabus arrives at its destination)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' This is our stop.
:{{Introductory Note|Kamisato Ayato}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh? We've arrived? But I haven't even finished chatting with Aeval yet!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I also enjoyed Aeval's introductions to Fontaine along the way. Everything you described was so clear and detailed that we can't help but want to hear more.
:{{Introductory Note|Kamisato Ayaka}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 aeval 03.ogg}} '''Aeval:''' Thank you so much! I'm usually working here on this aquabus, so I hope I'll have the chance to see you again. There are still many more places I'd like to introduce to you.
:;(The three disembark the aquabus)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Welcome to the Court of Fontaine.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Ah, Chiori! You sure have changed a lot. This is the first time we've seen you since you left Inazuma.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I haven't realized it's been so long. I was in such a rush when I left that I didn't even get to say goodbye.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Thank you for extending the invitation, Mr. Xavier. I'm looking forward to a fruitful trip here in Fontaine.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 10.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' It's an honor to have the head of the Kamisato Clan visit us.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So they are who you meant when you said you had actors coming from Inazuma?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh? It's {{Traveler}} and Paimon!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Wow, what a coincidence! Ayaka and I were just talking about you on the way here. Are you also here for the film?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We just ran into Xavier earlier, and came over with him.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, but I'm not an actress. Sir Kamisato and Lady Ayaka are the real actors here! I'm just tagging along with Ayaka to have a good time together.
:{{DIcon}} I thought I would always get the lead role.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 11.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Er, about that... I mean, how was I supposed to contact you when I was making preparations for the film? I figured you were probably busy, and I didn't want to disturb you...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 12.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' So I could only keep you in the back of my mind while I sought other actors to play the lead roles in this film.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I had been thinking about a surprise reunion with you during our trip here... But you still managed to surprise me first.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 13.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Oh, so you all know each other already? My, what a coincidence! What are the chances everyone could be brought together here like this?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 14.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Why don't we go to [[Hotel Debord]] and catch up over a meal? I've already made a reservation.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, did you reserve two spots for us, too?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 xavier 15.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Yes, of course, of course! I'll be sure to tell the boss to serve a few more delicious dishes, just to make sure there'll be enough food.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 3 ayato 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Very well. Then please kindly lead the way, Mr. Xavier.
:;(The group relocates to the fountain at [[Court of Fontaine: Vasari Passage]])<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 4 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Wow! The buildings in Fontaine are so tall... just look at how big they are!
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 4 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' And there's the fountain that Aeval mentioned earlier. It really is a magnificent sight.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 4 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' And look at that huge spinning sphere... where does it get its power? Wait a sec, could it be one of those clockwork meka we've heard so much about?
----
;(Enter Hotel Debord)
:;(The group is seated around a round table, having just finished eating)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Mmm, so this is what food from Fontaine is like! It sure is different from what we have in Inazuma. How should I describe it? It seems like you have to go through a lot more... steps to make them. And the flavor has many layers, too!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Ah yes, when I first went to Inazuma, I actually thought the food there tasted a little too bland. It took some time for me to get used to it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Let's get back to the purpose of this trip for a moment, shall we? How have preparations for the film been coming along, Mr. Xavier?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Well, I've already assembled most of the film crew... A lighting specialist, a prop manager, and a costume designer... I've also bought the copyrights from the novel's author.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, it's called "[[The Two Musketeers]]," right? I read the script you sent me on the way here, the story is pretty good!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Originally, I was planning to start filming as soon as Sir Kamisato and Lady Ayaka arrived in Fontaine. But, uh... I'm afraid I've run into a bit of a problem.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Oh? What is it?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' It has to do with the film's investor, Mr. Morris. He suddenly informed me this morning that he's encountered some financial trouble, and will be unable to release to me the amount of funding agreed upon...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' It's said that Fontaine's legal system is well-developed. If he has violated the contract, then can't you simply take him to court over the matter?
:;(Xavier stands and walks over to the railing)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Ah, well... I'm still more concerned about filming... Even if I were to take him to court, I'm afraid it would take months before the case could even be heard.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Then, is there a way we could raise funds ourselves to solve the problem?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I've considered that option, too. But, unfortunately, it's difficult to gather such a large amount of Mora on such short notice. Besides, we have to consider the Film Festival's submission deadline...
:;(Ayato and Ayaka look at each other)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' ...
:;(The two approach Xavier)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Mr. Xavier, if Ayaka and I were willing to perform for free, would that resolve the problem you are currently facing?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 07.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' What? N&mdash;No, out of the question. To have you come all this way just to act for free? ...No, no, no, that won't do.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' There's no need to worry, Mr. Xavier. My brother and I had actually intended to work for free after receiving your invitation.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Inazuma has only recently reopened its borders, and needs to strengthen its relations and cultural ties with other nations. We didn't have many collaboration projects with Fontaine in the past, so we hoped this trip would serve as a good start for the future.
:;(As Ayaka speaks, the rest of the group rises from their seats to approach Xavier)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Indeed, you could say that's the real reason why the [[Yashiro Commission]] agreed to come to Fontaine.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 08.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I understand, but... having you two act for free just doesn't seem right.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Not at all. While we're officially here to conduct a "cultural survey" of sorts, we must express our sincerity if we want to establish formal cultural ties with your nation.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 09.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' This film will serve as proof of friendly cooperation and cultural exchange between Inazuma and Fontaine. It's my hope that the film can be finished and released as smoothly as possible.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' If you still don't feel comfortable with this arrangement, I would also be more than happy to be introduced to some other renowned individuals in Fontaine's literary and artistic circles.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 09.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 10.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Alright, I'll do as you say. Thank you... Thank you so much. I'll make sure to cobble together enough Mora now, even if it means selling my house, my Kamera, and every single family heirloom!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' C'mon now, no need to go that far. I'll also help you out as a brand sponsor.
:{{DIcon}} We can help, too...
:{{DIcon}} Just say that you got our contribution from some personal friends.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Me too! Even though I didn't bring much Mora to spend on this trip... It's still better than nothing!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 11.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' You are too kind, all of you! *sniff* I... I really don't know how to...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Alright, enough about that. Now that we have Xavier's savings, my support, and two leads who are willing to act for free... I think we will be able to make this happen.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' So instead of Mora, you'll help with filming and production.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, but how can we help with that? We don't know much about making a film...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Alright, pull yourself together, Xavier. Tell us if there are still any open positions left among the crew.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 12.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' ...Oh, al&mdash;alright. Let me think... we still need a Kamera operator, a clapper loader, and someone to manage logistics.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 13.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I originally wanted to personally serve as director, but I've been too busy working as the producer... So, the positions of director and director's assistant will also need to be filled...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knows what the director and the logistics support person do, but what's a clapper loader?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 14.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The clapper loader is responsible for using the clapperboard to record and organize the information of each shot when the Kamera operator begins shooting. The work requires both patience and careful attention to detail.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A clapperboard? Oh, you mean the thing they hold that goes CLAP whenever they start filming?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yes, that's right. Are you interested in that job?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For sure! Paimon's always wanted to try that!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Alright, then you'll be our clapper loader. I can find someone from the store to help with logistics. What do you think, Xavier?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 15.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Fine by me. As for our Kamera operator, I was thinking of letting {{Traveler}} take the role.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s great when it comes to using a Kamera! Paimon can't even count how many things we've taken photos of during our journey.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 16.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Yes, that's also what I was thinking. I noticed {{Traveler}} had an eye for photography and composition when we worked together previously.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I'm sure that's due to {{Traveler}}'s journey across Teyvat and all the places they've seen. After so many adventures, using a Kamera must be second nature by now.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 17.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' What do you say, Traveler? Are you interested in the job?
:{{DIcon}} As long as I'll be able to help.
:{{DIcon}} Lights, Kamera, action!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 18.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Thank you, it really means a lot to me! C'mon, friend, let me give you a big, warm hug!
:{{DIcon}} Uh, I think we'd better get to work.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So all that's left for us to find is a director and an assistant.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh! Me, me, me! I want to be the director's assistant! All I need to do is help the director, right? I can handle that!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 19.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Alright, then all we need is a director... *sigh* All the well-known directors in Fontaine are probably also busy working on their own films these days... I'm not sure who will have time to help.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! [["The Little Oceanid"|Furina helped out a theater troupe recently]] by serving as an artistic consultant. She could be a good director, right? Besides, it's not like she has anything else to do right now...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 20.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' F&mdash;Furina?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 21.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Uh, do you really think Lady Furina would be willing to help us with our humble project?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Isn't that the name of Fontaine's Hydro Archon? My brother has already informed me about what happened here in Fontaine.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, that's her! She helped out a theater troupe not too long ago, and now she's taking up work as a director.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 22.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Well, uh...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, I saw that musical. [[La vaguelette|Her performance]] was perfect, and the storyboards were also excellent.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Don't let her former identity intimidate you. She's the best candidate we can think of right now. You'll never know until you give her a shot.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 23.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Fine... You're right, Chiori. I'll do anything for the sake of my film... anything!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 24a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 24b.ogg}}--> '''Xavier:''' Whew... Then I'll have to ask {{Traveler}} and Paimon to show me the way to Lady Furina's residence. I just hope she'll agree to help.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 11.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Do you need us to also come along?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 25.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' No, there's no need to trouble you with this. Besides, you've just arrived in Fontaine, and I'm sure there are many places you would like to visit.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 26.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Just leave this task to me... It's part of my duties as the producer.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayato 12.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Very well, then we'll be waiting to hear the good news.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I'll go with you. By the way, you might want to consider bringing a gift.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And don't worry, we won't simply drop you off at Furina's place! We know Furina pretty well by now, so having some familiar faces there should help your chances... Besides, the whole thing was our idea in the first place!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 27.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Alright, then I'll start making preparations. As for the gift...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Hmm, a gift for someone who was once seen as the Hydro Archon. I wonder what she would like...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 28.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I recall that Lady Furina once fancied a clockwork ring, so perhaps I should get another exquisite clockwork contraption for her?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Huh? Can't we just bring some desserts? Like the [[Fontinalia Mousse]]?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, but wouldn't that be a little too cheap? She does like desserts though...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Isn't the Fontinalia Festival happening right now? I heard Aeval tell us on the aquabus that Furina introduced the tradition of going door-to-door and asking for sweets.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' To do something like that... she must have a real sweet tooth.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I agree with Yoimiya. If the gift is too fancy, it might actually make her feel more uncomfortable.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright then! Let's go buy some Fontinalia Mousse!
:;(As the Traveler and Paimon buy Fontinalia Mousse from [[Leone]], Chiori and Xavier wait a short distance away)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 xavier 29.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' But will that really be enough? We'll be asking her to do a lot of work, you know.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmm, you're right. We need to further sweeten the deal.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You want something even sweeter than Fontinalia Mousse?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yes, we'll need a gift that's sweeter than any dessert in the world.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But what could that be?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 5 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Your words of praise.

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayaka or Yoimiya, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' You go ahead, no need to worry about us.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I hope Furina will like the gifts we prepared. Oh, and if you still think we should get something else for her, just let me know! I should be able to make some fireworks.

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayato, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Looking forward to the good news.

;(Approach Furina's apartment)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're here, this is where Furina lives.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Okay, I'll go knock on the door.
:'''Xavier:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *yawn* Coming, coming... Seriously, who's knocking before afternoon tea...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? Who are you?
:{{Introductory Note|Furina}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Lady Furina, please allow me to introduce myself. I am Xavier, a film director.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hello. Oh? Is that {{Traveler}} and Paimon I see behind you? And who's this...?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I'm Chiori.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, the one from Chioriya Boutique! Hello, hello.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So what are you all doing here? Do you need something?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you just get up, Furina? It's already past noon, you know...
:{{DIcon}} Ahem... Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Try to be nice, remember?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh, uh... Paimon means the weather is so nice in the afternoon, and the sun so warm, just like how you make us feel! Sleeping in late is a really smart idea!
:;(As Paimon dramatically voices her support of Furina's lifestyle, Xavier and the Traveler provide additional gestures of approval in the background)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, no... I was just up late last night reading some novels... What does sleeping in have to do with the weather?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Ahem, this is a small gift we prepared for you, Lady Furina. We hope you'll like it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' No need to be so formal, I'm just a regular person like everyone else now. Oh! Is this Fontinalia Mousse? It's one of my favorites!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' That's great! So, actually, there's something we need your help with...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Given your renowned passion and understanding of drama, I would like to ask you to serve as the director of our film crew.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? But didn't you just say that you're a director?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 xavier 07.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Yes, but for this particular project, I'm mainly working as a producer. Besides, I'm sure that your understanding of the performing arts far surpasses my own, Lady Furina.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Are {{Traveler}} and Paimon also part of the film crew?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 paimon 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo dyjeq001 6 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, we sure are! Paimon's the clapper loader and {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s the Kamera operator.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Kamera operator? That can be a pretty technical job, and it directly affects the final quality of the film. Are you really up to it?
:{{DIcon}} I have experience.
:{{DIcon}} I can show you if you like.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' No, I'm not questioning your abilities. It's just that, I've never really seen you use a Kamera before.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe you can come up with a test for {{Traveler}} and see for yourself!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 paimon 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo dyjeq001 6 paimon 06b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If {{MC|m=he|f=she}} can satisfy you with {{MC|m=his|f=her}} Kamera skills, then you'd have nothing to worry about and can join the team. Whaddya say?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Uh, you sure are getting better at rolling with the situation, Paimon. Hmm, I do wish to see how skilled {{Traveler}} really is with a Kamera.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, how about this... We'll work with what we have. I'll give you some scenarios, and see if your work is up to my standards.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, no problem.
:{{DIcon}} Whatever you say, Director Furina.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Very good. It's essential for the Kamera operator to understand the director's vision. I'll make my decision after seeing your work.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Are you ready? I have high standards, you know.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, I'm ready.
::{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 16a 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Okay. Grab the Kamera, and I'll give you a scenario.
::;(Opens [[#Filming Theme Directed by Furina|Filming Theme Directed by Furina]])
:{{DIcon}} Please wait a moment.
::{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 16b 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Sure. You can come back once you've reviewed the basics of film composition and feel ready.

;(Talk to Furina again, if "Please wait a moment." was chosen)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Are you ready? I have high standards, you know.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, I'm ready.
::{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 16a 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Okay. Grab the Kamera, and I'll give you a scenario.
::;(Opens [[#Filming Theme Directed by Furina|Filming Theme Directed by Furina]])
:{{DIcon}} Please wait a moment.
::{{A|vo dyjeq001 6 furina 16b 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Sure. You can come back once you've reviewed the basics of film composition and feel ready.
----
;(After filming)
:;(If one or more scenes were chosen incorrectly)
:::{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Let me be honest... Do you really think you have what it takes to shoot a film?
:::{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You put no thought into finding a good Kamera angle, and the characters weren't even in the shots. As for the original intent of the characters' lines... did you leave them somewhere in the vicinity of Elton Trench?
:::{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I mean, I guess you could be trying to pursue your definition of the avant-garde... if that's what you're doing, I suppose you do have to find yourselves a capable director...
:;(If all scenes were chosen correctly)
:::{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh? It appears that you have more skill than I thought.
:::{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' All the shots had great composition, and I could really feel a connection to the characters and their lines...
:{{DIcon}} So, what's the verdict?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, does that mean you agree to be our director, Furina?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hah, did you think I would agree just like that? After our performance of "The Little Oceanid", I've begun to make a name for myself again, you know.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' In fact, I've already had several troupes approach me for the Fontinalia Film Festival. Unfortunately, the scripts were all pretty boring, and didn't pique my interest.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If others were to find out I agreed to work with you so easily, then, well...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, but didn't we have a deal? What else do we need to do to convince you, Furina?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Uh... Well, what about the pay?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You know... how much you're willing to pay me to be the director? The pay is also an important factor for me to consider, you know!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Well, uh... I can offer you... this much...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...What? That's all!? If [[Neuvillette]] were to hear of this, he could charge you with underpaying your labor!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I'm sorry, but our crew is in a tight financial spot at the moment...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I see. Well, even though it's highly unlikely now that I'll join your crew, there's still something I'd like to ask... Exactly what film are you planning to make?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Oh, uh... Our script is an adaption of "The Two Musketeers."
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? Wait, you mean the suspense thriller novel that was a number-one bestseller?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so Furina's read it, too!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Of course I've read it! I've always had a keen interest in artistic works that strike a chord with the populace.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I see... It all makes sense now. You must've used most of the budget to pay for the copyright.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Uh, not really... The [[Baptiste|novel's author]] transferred the copyright to me practically for free once he heard that I wanted to make a film adaption of the story. The lack of budget is due to another issue...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' He probably just wants to get his name out there, so Mora isn't the most important thing to him right now.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It reminds me of a delivery courier who wears one of my designs while traveling all across Teyvat. I didn't charge her much for the outfit, either. The exposure she provides for my brand is well worth it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, are you a big fan of this story, Furina?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, uh... it's alright! The pacing of the story is good, but the character relationships could use some work. When I was reading it before, I always felt like some things were left on a rather unsatisfactory note. I have high standards, you know!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahem... Mr. Xavier, if, hypothetically speaking, I agree to be the director... how much freedom would I have in terms of script revisions and creative interpretation?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Oh, as much freedom as you would need! I wouldn't dare doubt the tastes of Fontaine's greatest star.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Good. Then I'm free to alter the script as I see fit?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Absolutely, no problem!
:{{DIcon}} We're counting on you, Director Furina.
:{{DIcon}} Now's your chance to make a film that you love.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm, alright. It seems that your crew really can't go on without my care and direction.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 07.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' So... you agree?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Yes, I agree. Although the pay is well below what someone of my caliber deserves, a great script calls for a great director.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I mustn't let a perfectly good story be ruined due to lack of funds. If you have fine cheese and bread, you wouldn't let it just sit on the counter and get moldy just because you lack an oven, right?
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Furina.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 08.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Oh, Hydro Archon above... I'm not dreaming, am I? Somebody pinch me.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 23.ogg}} '''Furina:''' There's no more Hydro Archon, you know... And it's still a little early to celebrate.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 24.ogg}} '''Furina:''' There's a lot that goes into shooting a film. Although the trickiest tasks of finalizing the script and casting the actors have already been taken care of, we'll still need to reserve filming locations, not to say set up lighting and props...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 25.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And by the way, since we'll be filming "The Two Musketeers", we'll need to find an action choreographer... Ideally, a professional who has actual experience with muskets.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 09.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Yes, I've thought about this as well. I was hoping that you might know someone who could handle the job.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 26.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Me? Hmm... if this was before, I could have simply asked [[Clorinde]]. But it's already been some time since I last talked to her.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 27.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Navia can also use firearms, but unfortunately, her style is quite different from that of the characters in the story.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Could we ask the [[Special Security and Surveillance Patrol]]?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 28.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, you mean the Special Patrol's Musketeers?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yes, that's right. They work with muskets every day. I can't think of anyone more qualified than them.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 29.ogg}} '''Furina:''' They would be under Neuvillette's jurisdiction. Unfortunately, I uh... Don't have any connection with them at all.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 30.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm, so... in the end, we still have to start by talking to Neuvillette...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No need to go to all that trouble. I know their captain, [[Chevreuse]].
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you do? Wait, Chiori, how do you know the captain of the Special Patrol's Musketeers?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No particular reason. Running a business means dealing with some trouble from time to time, and she's helped me out on a few occasions.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' In return, I've helped her handle a few situations in which the Special Patrol couldn't get involved directly. So, we've gotten to know each other over time.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, so you're saying there's been times when the Special Patrol needed a fashion designer to handle a situation? Your work is becoming more and more mysterious...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It'd be best to keep it that way. Anyway, enough about that. What do you all think about asking the captain to be our musket action choreographer?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 31.ogg}} '''Furina:''' She sounds professional enough. She is a captain, after all. I have no objections.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 10.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' But I imagine the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol must be busy with their duties. Do think she'd really have time to help with shooting a film? And then there's the issue of pay...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, it just so happens that she's also not the kind of person that's just after Mora. As for whether she has time, I'll have to go and ask her first.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 32.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Then I'll leave that to you. Macaroni's on sale today, so I've got to go. You can just tell me how things went when we discuss tomorrow's plan later.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 11.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' No problem.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeee! Having Furina join feels like a big boost to our team.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 33.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Of course, just wait until the day of our premiere. You'll witness the true power of my name in these lands! You'll be so glad I agreed to help. I can guarantee that even the standing tickets will be sold out.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 34.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'll be sure to ask some people I know to see if they'd be willing to act as extras.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ha, seems like you're finally getting more comfortable with your own reputation now!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 35.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I didn't ask for the clapper loader's commentary, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} I can't wait to see our film's premiere.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Then let's get going. I happen to know where Chevreuse is today.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 36.ogg}} '''Furina:''' By the way, I'm curious. If my pay is so low, then what about our two lead actors? Didn't they travel here all the way from Inazuma?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 xavier 12.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Actually, they told us that they see the trip as a part of cultural exchange... So they didn't ask for any pay.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 37.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What? So is every person in Teyvat who doesn't want money gathered here to shoot this film? Don't tell me Chiori isn't being paid either...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I already knew Xavier from before, and he's also agreed to give my brand some good exposure.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 8 furina 38.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It seems the gods have really smiled upon you, Xavier... And that certainly doesn't include me, mind you.

;(Talk to Furina, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Besides the macaroni, I should also pick up some tomato sauce...

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Alright, this is the place.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? But where's the captain? There's hardly anyone around here.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' She's over there... The one with an eye patch reading in front of the newsstand.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, her! Paimon could tell there was something different about her. She seems kinda intimidating!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Please wait here for a moment, I'll go fetch her. She's working now, so you might not want to get in her way.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Working? But isn't she just standing there and reading a novel?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Just trust me.
:;(Chiori walks towards Chevreuse)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... alright. Let's see what happens then...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chiori sure is a mysterious person... She claims just to be a fashion designer, but she knows all these powerful people.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The Court of Fontaine isn't particularly tolerant of visitors from overseas, so it isn't easy for a foreigner to promote their brand here... Even more so in the competitive world of fashion.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Even a local like me just trying to make a film has to face all kinds of challenges, so I can only imagine what Chiori has been through to get to where she is today. I'm sure that having more connections has definitely worked in her favor.
:;(Chiori walks up between Chevreuse and the book stall owner)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Reading on the job?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Detective novel.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' One main character?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' No, multiple. Branching storylines.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I see. How's the plot coming along?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' One of the main characters is about to make a choice that will affect the rest of his life. I'd wager he's going to make the wrong choice.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Any way to speed things up? There's something I need your help with.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You know that doesn't depend on me. It all comes down to what the character chooses.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Which is exactly why I'm here to help.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:;(The nearby book stall owner and customer turn to look at each other)
:;(The stall owner grabs something and hands it over to the customer, who then turns to leave)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Alright. It appears he made the wrong choice in the end.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Halt!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 bookstallowner 01.ogg}} '''Book Stall Owner:''' Huh!? Wh&mdash;What's going on?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Hand over whatever you're holding.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 bookstallguest 01.ogg}} '''Book Stall Customer:''' Oh, it's just a book. I didn't buy anything else.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind letting me have a look.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 bookstallowner 02.ogg}} '''Book Stall Owner:''' Excuse me, officer. I don't mind you standing around here and not purchasing anything, but I'd prefer if you didn't disturb my customers. It's bad for business, you know.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Don't give me that act. You won't be able to get off so easily, either.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 11.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I am Chevreuse, Captain of Fontaine's Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. I will say this one last time &mdash; hand over whatever you're holding at once.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' And before you do anything unwise, let me remind you that I'll have you on the ground before you can even think about making a run for it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 bookstallguest 02.ogg}} '''Book Stall Customer:''' Ah! Alright, alright, I'll give it to you!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 bookstallguest 03.ogg}} '''Book Stall Customer:''' B&mdash;But, please let me say something first! If there's any contraband in that book, then the shopkeeper here is the one who slipped it in. I don't have anything to do with this!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 bookstallowner 03.ogg}} '''Book Stall Owner:''' Why, you! Trying to leave me on the hook, huh? You were the one who said you wanted it...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 13.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Save it for the interrogation room.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 14.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Take them away, [[Letellier]].
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's going on here? One second you're reading a book, the next you're escorting people away!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 15.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' And who are... Oh? Aren't you the Traveler who's been all over the papers recently? Chiori, I'm assuming what you wanted to ask me about has to do with them, right?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 16.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Eh, maybe I can let you in on what's happening then.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 17.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Now that [[Vacher]] has been brought to justice, no new shipments of [[Sinthe]] will be made and distributed to sellers. The Fontaine Gardes have been busy collecting the remaining Sinthe still circulating on the market.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 18.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thanks to a tip from our reliable source here, this should be the very last batch.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you were pretending to read a book in order to catch the bad guys...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon almost forgot to introduce ourselves! Paimon is Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}} and Xavier.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 19.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Hey, I'm Chevreuse. You probably already heard me introduce myself, so I won't bother repeating it.
:{{DIcon}} Why didn't you just arrest them immediately?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yeah, why didn't you make a move as soon as you had the chance? Were you worried that my intel wasn't accurate?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 20.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' No, I wanted to see if the shopkeeper would turn himself in first.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 21.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' All he had to do was come up to me and say that he didn't know where the Sinthe had come from. If he did that, then I wouldn't have had to press charges on him.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' He had the whole day to turn the Sinthe over to Chevreuse. But instead, the moment I came up and blocked Chevreuse's line of sight, he took the opportunity to sell it off.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 22.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yes, he made the wrong choice, even though the right choice was right there in front of him.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But you knew they wouldn't make the right choice.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 23.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yeah, I knew. I was just hoping I'd be wrong for once.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 24.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Enough about that, though. What did you want to ask me about?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you see, it's like this...
:;(Paimon explains the situation to Chevreuse)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 25.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' "The Two Musketeers"... You certainly have a good eye for a story.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 26.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' So what do you need me to do? Just be the action choreographer for the actors?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Yes, that's right. I want to make sure we get all the details right... I want the actors' posture and understanding of firearms to be as realistic as possible.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' However, I'm afraid this work will require quite a bit of your time, since you'll have to be present whenever we are filming... Also, as for the pay...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 27.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' No need to say any more. I'll join.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Just like that!?<ref group="Note">The voice-over for this line was mistakenly melded with a voice-over that is for the {{Quest|Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp!}}. Around 12 seconds after Paimon finishes saying this line, if the dialogue has not yet been advanced, Paimon will then say, "What {{Rubi|Bull-Chucker|"Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King"}} is really saying is... 'If you wanna fight the Oni King, you have to go through Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon first!'"</ref>
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' R&mdash;Really? You're willing to help us with our humble film project?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 28.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Sure, it's no big deal. As I said, we've wrapped up our investigation here, so I don't have any other tasks on my plate for the moment.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 29.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Besides, I personally really like this novel. I even have the collector's edition at home. Stories where justice prevails over evil never get old for me.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Then we've got a deal?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 30.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' See you on-set tomorrow.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Oh my... I can hardly believe it! I should tell Lady Furina immediately. Oh, and I must tell the prop manager and lighting technician to get everything ready. We start filming tomorrow!
:;(Xavier runs off)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Calm down, Xavier. The film is going to take more than just a day to finish.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Still, I should also head back now and start preparing the actors' costumes and make-up.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, guess that's it for today then.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chevreuse 31.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, please stay for a moment. I have something to tell you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Then I'll take Xavier back. Poor thing, he's so excited that he can't even walk straight anymore. I don't want to spend our first day fishing our producer out of the fountain.
:{{DIcon}} See you tomorrow!
::{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 17a 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yep, see you tomorrow.
:{{DIcon}} I think Xavier would probably be able to hold himself together.
::{{A|vo dyjeq001 9 chiori 17b 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' He'd better.
----
;(Approach Chevreuse)
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what did you want to tell us, Chevreuse?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Have you read "The Two Musketeers"?
:{{DIcon}} I've heard a bit about it.
:{{DIcon}} I haven't read it yet.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The story is about a pair of children born into the household of a baron, and their struggle to survive together and take revenge for their mother.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' They were raised at the baron's estate, where their mother worked as a maid. The two were illegitimate children that the baron had with the maid, so they were never treated well by anyone.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' One day, upon returning home, they found their mother had been murdered and left dead on the floor. It was quite evident that the culprits were the other members of the baron's household, who never had any kind words to say to them.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' However, the baron was able to exert his influence and keep the whole thing under wraps. The mother's death was eventually deemed as a suicide, and there was no chance of bringing her murderers to justice. The two siblings decided to flee and someday avenge their mother.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Many years later, members of the baron's family suddenly started turning up dead one after the other... all killed by gunshot. A Rainbow Rose was found on each of the victim's bodies, being the flower that the kids' mother liked best.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The baron believed that the mother's soul had come to take vengeance on him, so he lived in fear each day.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But it was actually those two siblings who had fled all those years ago. They relied on each other to survive and trained day and night, eventually becoming adept musketeers.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' They used all of their abilities to collect evidence and clues, before executing their plan and exacting revenge on the baron. Their actions let the truth behind their mother's death be known to all.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's quite an exhilarating story!
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yep, the baron got what he deserved for his evil deeds, and justice was able to prevail. It was just the kind of story I enjoy.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so is that why you were so willing to join our crew, Chevreuse?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 11.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You could say it was one of the reasons.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? You mean there were other reasons, too?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I've read the reports about you. Whether it was at the trials, or when you lent your hand to resolve our nation's crisis...
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 13.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You've shown that you've got a strong sense of justice, as well as a great mind for deductions.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, so what you're implying is...
:{{DIcon}} There's a case that you need our help with?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 14.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yes, you're as sharp as I expected. It seems you've experienced many similar situations before.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 15.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' There's been a recent murder case involving muskets. The perpetrator's methods appear to be very similar to what is described in the novel.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Really!? But Paimon didn't see anything about that in today's papers.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 16.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The Marechaussee Phantom hasn't yet released any information to the public, because the investigation is currently at a standstill. The murderer is extremely cautious.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A murder involving firearms... But not that many people use those in Fontaine, right?
:{{DIcon}} Could it be someone from your platoon?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 17.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Impossible. We perform a routine inspection of our firearms and ammo reserves every day. If one of the weapons had been fired, it would stick out like a sore thumb. Besides, I trust the members of my platoon.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 18.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' However... Well, that's all I can disclose about the case today.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Whaddya mean?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 19.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I hope you all can go back and get some shut-eye. You can decide tomorrow whether or not you'd like to join the investigation with me.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 20.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I'm aware this might not be the ideal time to add more to your plate, but the more capable people we have, the better the chances that justice will prevail.
:{{DIcon}} Can't someone from the Special Patrol help you investigate?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 21.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Carrying out investigations isn't actually supposed to be our responsibility. Our job is to apprehend the perpetrators... finding them is really up to the Marechaussee Phantom. You could say I'm taking part in the investigation out of personal interest.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 22.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I don't want people to see muskets in a negative way, and also... I'm concerned about the similarity between the crimes and the story.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean... they might be connected somehow?
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 23.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I suspect so.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 24.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Just to make myself clear, this is not an order, nor is it a deal of any kind. It's a request, nothing more.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 25.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' If you two have any interest in the case after we finish filming tomorrow, and are willing to assist me, then I would be most grateful.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, what do you think, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} It's already been quite a day...
:{{DIcon}} Let's give it some thought tomorrow.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, you're right. Paimon's getting a little tired, too. We've really been hustling all day.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 26.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You'd better head back and get some rest. It's good to keep a calm mind, especially when you're about to make an important decision.
:{{A|vo dyjeq001 10 chevreuse 27.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Otherwise, when the moment comes, you might end up like that shopkeeper, and not even realize that the right choice is right there in front of you.

:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Your proposals are reasonable, and quite well-thought out. Your sincerity and wish for our mutual success was evident in your words, so there's no need to be so modest.

:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If you're asking for my personal opinion... I'm willing to cooperate in full based on my own opinions and my impression of Inazuma's culture.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq001 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, Fontaine doesn't run simply based on the feelings of one individual. I'm sure Inazuma must be the same. Everything must be done in accordance with the regulations that are in place.

==Trivia==
* There is no alternate dialogue for players who have never spoken to Xavier.
* The following line from Paimon appears to reference off-screen interactions: "Oh, Paimon remembers now! Navia said that her clothes were designed by Chiori! And Kirara's outfit, too!" Prior to Roses and Muskets, Chiori's role in designing the outfits of Kirara and Navia was only revealed through:
** Kirara's Character Story 4, her "About Chiori" voice-over, and the description of her outfit, [[Whirling Bloom]], in Kirara's case; and
** the Version 4.3 [[Special Program]] in dialogue between the voice actors, in Navia's case.
