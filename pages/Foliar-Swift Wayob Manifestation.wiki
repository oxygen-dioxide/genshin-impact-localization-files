|name_1      = Chain Bursts
|desc_1      = Locks onto the player with a sigil, and after a delay, causes 3 consecutive blasts that expand outward, each dealing '''90% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}. Repeated hits have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]].
* '''Local Legend:''' Additionally summons 2 circular blasts, each dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.
|file_1_2    = Foliar-Swift Wayob Manifestation Chain Bursts 2
|caption_1_2 = Local Legend

|name_2      = Poison Field
|desc_2      = Creates a field of poison at the player's location, dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}} every '''0.5''' seconds for '''4''' seconds.
* '''Local Legend:''' This attack is disabled.

|name_3      = Rupturing Blast
|desc_3      = Charges and fires a beam of energy, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.

|name_4      = Arena: Moment of Trial
|desc_4      = Deploys an Arena and gains a non-elemental shield equal to '''111.4%''' of the Wayob Manifestation's Max [[HP]] which can be destroyed by dealing DMG.
* While the Arena is active:
** Characters within it lose all [[Energy]] and cannot gain Energy.
** Characters within it deal '''120%''' increased DMG, and [[Nightsoul's Blessing|Nightsoul]]-aligned DMG is additionally increased by '''60%'''.
** The Wayob Manifestation summons vines that move outward in a X-shaped pattern 3 times, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.
* If the Arena's duration ends and the shield is not destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation summons a massive field of spikes, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}, and converts the remaining percentage of its shield to a {{Dendro}} elemental shield.{{Elemental Shield Data|Dendro|24|Maximum}}
* If the non-elemental shield is destroyed before the Arena's duration ends, a massive amount of Elemental Particles will spawn, restoring '''90''' base Energy. The actual amount restored will vary based on [[Energy Recharge]], whether the character is on or off-field, and the number of characters in the party.
* When either shield is active, the Wayob Manifestation is immune to all DMG.
* When either shield is destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation becomes paralyzed for 5 seconds.
* '''Local Legend:''' This attack is disabled.

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Special Attack
|desc_1      = Summons 7 circular blasts, each dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.

|name_2      = Land of Decision
|desc_2      = Periodically, the Local Legend will exile the player into the Land of Decision. In this land, a single [[Swiftstep Seeker]] and [[Swiftstep Storm Scout]] will appear. Around these enemies, there is a poison field which deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}} on hit. This field can be removed with {{cx}}.<br><br>Killing these enemies will grant a stack of "Curse," up to a maximum of 15 stacks. Each stack of "Curse" increases the player's DMG dealt by '''60%''', but also causes the active character to lose '''1% Max HP + 50 HP''' every '''0.5''' seconds. A new batch of Swiftstep enemies will spawn when the current batch is defeated. To leave the Land of Decision, the player must interact with the Nightsoul Fault, after which the DMG-boosting effect of "Curse" is retained for 15 seconds and the HP loss effect is immediately removed.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|The [[Scions of the Canopy]] believe in and worship the Wayob, which manifests upon the land with the power of totems and Nightsouls.<br>In the stories of the storytellers, Wayob manifestations often appear as the messengers of trials, or guides to the kingdom of the [[Lord of the Night]]. A Saurian-Crowned Warrior once said that he fought with a Wayob in a trance while practicing his skills, and in doing so, gained deeper understanding.<br>The Scions of the Canopy believe their Wayob has the power to control the growth of fruits and leaves, and can also control the roots of crops and draw the patterns of the veins of leaves.|[[Archive]]}}
