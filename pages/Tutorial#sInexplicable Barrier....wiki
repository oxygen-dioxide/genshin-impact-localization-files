|text1    = A kind of impenetrable shield known in Inazuma as a Thunder Barrier.<br />For some mysterious reason, receiving the acknowledgment of {{Color|help|Electrograna}} and carrying them with you allows you to pass through some such barriers unimpeded.
|image2   = Tutorial Adventure Inexplicable Barrier... 2.png
|text2    = However, some strong barriers can only be traversed with much stronger Electrograna. Perhaps offering {{Color|help|Electro Sigils}} to the Sacred Sakura at the Grand Narukami Shrine will one day allow you to pass through all areas shut off by Thunder Barriers.

|text3    = Some Thunder Barriers seal Thunderstones within them. These fragments of raw, unbridled energy can be temporarily suppressed with Electrograna.<br />While a Thunderstone is suppressed, the Thunder Barrier around it is removed.
