|text1    = If you should see ripples in a nearby water body, this means that it is a Fishing Point. Get close to this Fishing Point and interact with it to start fishing.<br />Fish are quite sensitive to their surroundings. If you stand too close or perform combat actions, the fish will be frightened and will scatter, and they will take a while to calm down and come closer to the water body again.
|image2   = Tutorial System Fishing 2.png
|text2    = Different water bodies contain different species of fish. While preparing to fish, you can view the species that can be found here and select the appropriate rod and bait.<br />You can obtain blueprints for making bait from the [[Mondstadt Fishing Association]]. Learning them will allow you to make bait at any [[Crafting Bench]].<br />Note that different fish are attracted to different kinds of bait~

|text3    = Hold the Cast Rod button to enter aiming mode: let go of said button to flick your bait and hook out.<br />If your hook lands too far from the fish, its ability to attract them will greatly decrease.<br />If it lands too close by, the fish will be startled and will flee the scene.
|image4   = Tutorial System Fishing 4.png
|text4    = When the fish are on the hook, press the Raise Hook button, or the fish might finish eating the bait and flee.<br />Once you've successfully raised your hook, the fish will start to struggle.
|image5   = Tutorial System Fishing 5.png
|text5    = When the fish enters a struggling state, you can hold and release the Fish button to adjust your fishing line tension and keep it in the yellow Ideal Tension Zone. Fishing progress will only increase if you stay in the Ideal Tension Zone. Otherwise, progress will drop.<br />Once progress is full, you will have successfully caught this fish.
|image6   = Tutorial System Fishing 6.png
|text6    = Fish on the hook will sometimes enter periods of intense struggle. At this time, the speed at which line tension may change will be affected, and the Ideal Tension Zone will turn orange and start to fluctuate slightly.<br />If your fishing progress hits 0, the fish will try to escape. The Tension Zone will then turn red and start to fluctuate.
