The '''Crimson Agate''' is an Adventure Item which can be found in the [[Dragonspine]] area. Crimson Agates can be offered to the [[Frostbearing Tree]] in Dragonspine for rewards, similar to the [[Statue of The Seven|Statues of the Seven]] and the [[Reputation]] system. They can be found scattered in the overworld, in certain [[chests]], or as a repeatable reward from completing a [[Crimson Wish]]. Chests that contain a Crimson Agate have a dark red aura surrounding them.

When an overworld Crimson Agate is within close proximity of a player, an icon will appear on their mini map along with a sound effect, like with other elemental [[oculi]]. However, chests containing a Crimson Agate do not appear on the mini map. Additionally, Crimson Agates lack a corresponding [[Oculus Resonance Stone|resonance stone]] to direct a player to their general location.

80 Crimson Agates can be found in the overworld or in chests, allowing a player to raise their Frostbearing Tree's Offering Level from Level 1 to Level 9 before completing any Crimson Wishes, which are unlocked at Level 8.

==Archive Description==
A crystal formed from the combination of coalesced energy and the unique energies of [[Dragonspine]]. This will prove excellent nutrition for the [[Frostbearing Tree]], which yearns to grow further.

When the [[Skyfrost Nail|nail]] that froze Dragonspine descended, the trunk and canopy of this tree shattered into many fragments that were then frozen. A long time later, [[Durin|a black dragon]] fell into [[Wyrmrest Valley|the valley]] and its blood seeped into the ley lines. And a long time after that, [[Traveler|someone]] has broken the icy shackles, and the ancient tree that has absorbed that "crimson" has now sprouted anew...

==Trivia==
* Players can obtain as many Crimson Agates as desired as long as the Frostbearing Tree is not raised to Level 12, as [[Crimson Wish]] does not become permanently unavailable until then.
