''Available after completing [[Dual Evidence]].''
:'''Hulwani:''' (*sigh* It's better to just stay out of trouble. Just pretend that I didn't see anything.)

''Available after giving Soheil a slate.''
:'''Hulwani:''' (Heh, forget it. Guess I'm not gonna return to Sumeru City anytime soon.)

''Available after completing [[Soheil's Wish]].''
