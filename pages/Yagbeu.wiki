:'''Yagbeu:''' Hello.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Yagbeu knows)
:::'''Yagbeu:''' Do rocks count? Just now, I heard someone mention that there's some good ore nearby.
:::'''Yagbeu:''' I don't know much about rocks though, and even less when it comes to mining big lumps of Magical Crystal Ore. If you're interested, go take a look.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Yagbeu knows)
:::'''Yagbeu:''' Nothing out of the ordinary, really... In other words, things have been pretty peaceful.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Yagbeu:''' Huh...
::'''Yagbeu:''' Generally speaking, people don't really come over and talk to lone members of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]].
::{{DIcon}} Will something bad happen if someone does?
::'''Yagbeu:''' No, not really.
::'''Yagbeu:''' As long as you don't hear me whistle, it means everything around us is normal.
::'''Yagbeu:''' Just go about doing what you need to get done.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Yagbeu:''' Mmm.
