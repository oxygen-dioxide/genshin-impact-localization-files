|description    = A tranquil settlement that takes on the unique aesthetic of [[Vimara Village]]. Even if this furnishing set is not situated by a river or at the seaside, a whiff of the aroma of fish that wafts through this village will set the sound of water gurgling through your ears.<br>Vimara Village has a very different feeling from the [[Forest Ranger]] camp, for its inhabitants largely do not shoulder important duties and thus lead leisurely lives, thus making it a very nice place to be for those who wish to relax.
