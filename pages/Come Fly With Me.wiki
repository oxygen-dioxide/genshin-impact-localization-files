{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Magnifico)
:'''Magnifico:''' "...Come sit by me if you love me true, hasten not to bid me adieu..."
:'''Magnifico:''' "...*humming*... I'm a young cowherd, and I know I did wrong..."

;(Talk to Magnifico)
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha! I knew we'd meet again! Your timing is impeccable, too &mdash; you are about to witness my second masterpiece!
:'''Magnifico:''' Hmm... Maybe not the second. I do have a ton of fine works, don't I...
:'''Magnifico:''' Either way, you're most fortunate, for you shall witness me attempt dynamic photography for the first time!
:'''Magnifico:''' After all, the photos I used to take were all those of victims at crime scenes... Uh, never mind. That does not bear going into detail about...
:'''Paimon:''' So, do you need our help again this time, Mr. Magnifico?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr?
:'''Magnifico:''' No, no, certainly n... Hmm, on second thoughts, that would be marvelous! Come, let me explain the situation to you.
:'''Magnifico:''' So, here's the situation. I need to take photos of a [[Qucusaurus]] diving toward the water's surface at this waterfall. We want to catch that most impactful of frames, just as it plunges right down to the surface!
:'''Magnifico:''' I've hidden food that can attract Qucusaurs in the pond beneath the waterfall. It's just that... *sigh* Well, they haven't come down at the right angle yet.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Hang on. What's that big circle there on the water's surface?
:'''Magnifico:''' I wouldn't worry too much about it, though I'm not too sure what it is... It's just some junk I picked up from a nearby tribe to use as a target.
:'''Magnifico:''' *sigh* All the scrap photos I've taken so far are utterly mundane, so much so that it's annoying. I could keep waiting, but since you're here...
:'''Magnifico:''' Perhaps you could... uh, guide them? Teach them how to perform a most lovely dive? I mean, you are a Saurian tamer famed throughout Natlan, are you not?
:'''Magnifico:''' Alright? Great! I'll send a signal out from here. So long as you can get to the precise location of the target by the water when I count down to "one," we're all set!
:{{DIcon}} We can give it a go.
::'''Magnifico:''' Haha, excellent! Let's give it a try, then!
:{{DIcon}} We can't guarantee success...
::'''Paimon:''' That's fine. If we fail, all we've lost is time. And we're travelers &mdash; no one's time is worth less than ours.
::'''{{Little One}}:''' ?
----
;(Talk to Magnifico during the challenge, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' What's up? Are those little ones refusing to listen to you as well?

;(While attempting the shot for the first time)
:'''Magnifico:''' Yes, stand right there, and wait for my countdown...
:'''Magnifico:''' And we're off!
:'''Magnifico:''' Six&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Five&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Four&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Uh... What's that on the camera lens?
:'''Magnifico:''' Wait. Where was I... What number was I on?
:'''Magnifico:''' ... Agh, drat! Come on, dangit!
:'''Magnifico:''' Three&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Two&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' One&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' And&mdash; click!

;(During the second attempt)
:'''Magnifico:''' Six&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Five&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Three&mdash; *cough* *gag*!
:'''Magnifico:''' P&mdash;Pthoeey! Gah, a huge bug just... flew into my mouth!
:'''Magnifico:''' *cough* *cough* So bitter... and spicy! *gurgle* *gag*
:'''Magnifico:''' Ugh, darnit!
:'''Magnifico:''' Four&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Five...
:'''Magnifico:''' Uh, I mean, three&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Two&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' One&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' And&mdash; click!

;(For subsequent attempts)
:'''Magnifico:''' Six&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Five&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Four&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Three&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Two&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' One&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' And&mdash; click!

;(If the shot was failed)
:'''Magnifico:''' Agh, drat! A failure! What kind of trash is this!? Garbage, I tell you, garbage!
:'''{{sic|{{Little One}}}}:''' What!?
:'''Paimon:''' Could you not be so jumpy all the time!?
;(After failing the first attempt)
::'''Magnifico:''' *sigh* As you can see, the results are... not ideal. As the deeds, so the man &mdash; unsuccessful both!
::'''Magnifico:''' Ah... My family always told me that even small trees can cast huge shadows... But it's nonsense! Nonsense! They only meant to humiliate me, surely!
::'''Magnifico:''' Ugh...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey, don't get mad! You're not going to get any bigger even if you do!
::{{DIcon}} Don't give up...
:::'''Magnifico:''' Give up? Who says I'm giving up? Nay! Anger and shame only drive me on, give me strength &mdash; that is their purpose! We continue!
:::'''Paimon:''' Well, he's sure fired up... Still a pretty weird guy, though.
:::'''Magnifico:''' Yes, yes.
::{{DIcon}} Let's give this another go.
:::'''Magnifico:''' Yes, let's!
:::'''Paimon:''' Whoa, you sure recover fast!

;(After failing subsequent attempts)
::'''Magnifico:''' Gah, we must start over! ...Uh, if you don't mind, I mean.
::'''Paimon:''' *sigh* There's no "mind" or "don't mind." We're already here, aren't we?
::{{DIcon}} Let's continue, then.
:::'''Magnifico:''' You have my thanks.
::{{DIcon}} Let's take a break first...
:::'''Paimon:''' That's right. Jumping off cliffs is hard work, y'know?
:::'''Magnifico:''' Ah... Yes. I did not consider that. Alright, just start whenever you're ready. I will wait for you here.
----
;(After completing the shot)
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha! Perfect! Here, have a copy!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, that *is* amazing!
:'''Magnifico:''' Here's your compensation. This is the second... No, the third time you've aided me. If not for you... Why, I doubt I'd have a chance of finishing my photo-taking trip at all!
:'''Magnifico:''' My destination is... Here. I've marked it out on your map. Again, if you're interested, I look forward to working with you again.
:'''Magnifico:''' Ah! It's almost time. I've got to go now. See you, and good luck!
