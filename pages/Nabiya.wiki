==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nabiya:''' Temptation triggers love, but too much love triggers disaster...
:'''Nabiya:''' Luckily, they don't care too much for you.
:{{DIcon}} Who are "they"...?
::'''Nabiya:''' [[Harut]] and [[Marut]]. They're the shadows of nimble demons, free and unfettered creatures...
::'''Nabiya:''' ...They're also my cats.
::{{DIcon}} Then "temptation" and "love" are...?
::'''Nabiya:''' Cats are curious creatures. They have many strengths, but curiosity is not one of them.
::'''Nabiya:''' Their curiosity and penchant strand fish on the shore and trap birds on the ground...
::'''Nabiya:''' That means disaster for the fish and birds, no?
:{{DIcon}} That's a shame.
::'''Nabiya:''' Perhaps, perhaps not.
