==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nabiya:''' Temptation triggers love, but too much love triggers disaster...
:'''Nabiya:''' Luckily, they don't care too much for you.
:{{DIcon}} Who are "they"...?
::'''Nabiya:''' [[Harut]] and [[Marut]]. They're the shadows of nimble demons, free and unfettered creatures...
::'''Nabiya:''' ...They're also my cats.
::{{DIcon}} Then "temptation" and "love" are...?
:::'''Nabiya:''' Cats are curious creatures. They have many strengths, but curiosity is not one of them.
:::'''Nabiya:''' Their curiosity and penchant strand fish on the shore and trap birds on the ground...
:::'''Nabiya:''' That means disaster for the fish and birds, no?
:{{DIcon}} That's a shame.
::'''Nabiya:''' Perhaps, perhaps not.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nabiya:''' Sweetness is the most terrifying temptation. You must know how to enjoy happiness, yet not lose yourself in it.
:'''Nabiya:''' It's like how eating too many Candied Ajilenakh Nuts can give you cavities. Too much sweetness is suffering.
:'''Nabiya:''' See, even Harut and Marut understand this truth.
:'''Nabiya:''' You definitely look like a most fortunate person, but they don't seem to be clinging to you, now do they?
