|name_1      = Blizzard
|desc_1      = Causes blizzard to rain down in a circular area, repeatedly dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} every '''0.3''' seconds for '''1.5''' seconds. Repeated hits have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_2      = Biting Storm
|desc_2      = Releases a windstorm in a cone-shaped area in front of itself, repeatedly dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} every '''0.3''' seconds for '''6''' seconds. Repeated hits have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_3      = Rupturing Blast
|desc_3      = Charges and fires a beam of energy, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
* '''Local Legend:''' Fires 5 beams in succession.

|name_4      = Arena: Moment of Trial
|desc_4      = Deploys an Arena and gains a non-elemental shield equal to '''111.4%''' of the Wayob Manifestation's Max [[HP]] which can be destroyed by dealing DMG.
* While the Arena is active:
** Characters within it lose all [[Energy]] and cannot gain Energy.
** Characters within it deal '''120%''' increased DMG, and [[Nightsoul's Blessing|Nightsoul]]-aligned DMG is additionally increased by '''60%'''.
** The Wayob Manifestation summons falling hailstones that spread outward in a X-shaped pattern 4 times, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
* If the Arena's duration ends and the shield is not destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation causes a massive blast, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}, and converts the remaining percentage of its shield to a {{Frozen}} elemental shield.{{Elemental Shield Data|Cryo|48|Maximum}}
* If the non-elemental shield is destroyed before the Arena's duration ends, a massive amount of Elemental Particles will spawn, restoring '''90''' base Energy. The actual amount restored will vary based on [[Energy Recharge]], whether the character is on or off-field, and the number of characters in the party.
* When either shield is active, the Wayob Manifestation is immune to all DMG.
* When either shield is destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation becomes paralyzed for 5 seconds.
* '''Local Legend:''' This ability is disabled.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|The Masters of the Night-Wind believe in and worship the Wayob, which manifests upon the land with the power of totems and Nightsouls.<br>The Masters of the Night-Wind have tried using many mediums to communicate with the Night Kingdom. Eventually, they discovered that the medium that allowed them to establish the most stable connection with the Wayob was obsidian. This may explain why, over the ages, Wayob Manifestations have taken on a form that resembles a stone statue. The Masters of the Night-Wind believe their Wayob has the power to control the process of freezing and crystallization, and can also command both fixedness and mutability.|[[Archive]]}}
