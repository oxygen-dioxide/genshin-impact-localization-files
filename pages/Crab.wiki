'''Crabs''' are a [[Cooking Ingredient]] commonly found in the wild all over [[Teyvat]].

==How to Obtain==
Wild Crabs are found on beaches and shallow waters around Teyvat, notably in [[Inazuma]] due to its archipelago topography, and must be caught by the player to obtain a default Crab item regardless of the [[Crabs|species]] caught.

Loctions with a high concentration of Crabs include [[Falcon Coast]], [[Guyun Stone Forest]], the [[Nameless Island]], [[Kujou Encampment]], the beach strip stretching from [[Ritou]] to [[Araumi]] and the farmost islet northeast of [[Narukami Island]].

See the Video Guides section or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=116 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.
