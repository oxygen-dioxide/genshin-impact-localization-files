:'''Manie:''' Hello traveler. Would you care for some freshly picked [[Jueyun Chili]]s?
:{{DIcon}} Jueyun {{sic|chili}}?
::'''Manie:''' Yes, they're grown exclusively in [[Jueyun Karst]] &mdash; hence the name.
::'''Manie:''' A&mdash;a&mdash;achoo!

:::'''Manie:''' I've been asked this question by lots of people.
:::'''Manie:''' The way I see it, the proof is in the pudding!
