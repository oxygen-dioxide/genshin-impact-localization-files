'''Dragons''', also known in their juvenile form as '''[[Vishaps]]''', are enormous and powerful creatures that inhabit both land and sea of [[Teyvat]].

They are creatures of the [[Light Realm]] and were the dominant race of the old world before the arrival of the [[Heavenly Principles]]. It defeated the [[Seven Sovereigns]], the dragon-lords who ruled the old world, and created a new world for humanity.<ref name="BSaM">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref>

==Overview==
Dragons are a naturally large species of reptilians with varying appearances. Some are quadrupedal, some are serpentine, and some either have wings or none at all. They typically have physical attributes reminiscent of their associated [[element]]: for example, the Earth Dragon [[Azhdaha]] has rough stone skin befitting of {{Geo}}, while [[Dvalin]] has a much more sleek and svelte appearance befitting of {{Anemo}}.<ref group="Note">In Azhdaha's design notes and the Chinese version of ''Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved'', Azhdaha is called an {{Lang|Earth Dragon|zh=地龙}} rather than a Geo Dragon, which would be {{zh|岩龙}}, although he is still affiliated with the Geo element. The English localization similarly opts to translate {{zh|风龙}} as "Wind Dragon" instead of "Anemo Dragon" in ''Breeze Amidst the Forest''.</ref> A dragon's size is proportional to its strength; the immensely powerful Azhdaha, at his full strength, was as large as a mountain range,<ref name="Unforged">{{Ref/Weapon|The Unforged|Lore}}</ref> and his size when fought in [[Beneath the Dragon-Queller]] is his form after years of [[erosion]].<ref name="Azhdaha Design">Design Notes: [[Azhdaha/Design|The Birth of a Dragon: A Behind the Scenes Look At the Creation of Azhdaha]]</ref> Dvalin is also stated to have suddenly grown in both size and power when he reemerged as Stormterror.<ref name="AQ0-1-8">{{Ref/Quest|Knights of Favonius (Quest)}}</ref>

Vishaps and elemental dragons are born from the elements.<ref name="BAtF1">{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest|1|Ballad Selection Excerpt}}</ref><ref name="ZL2-4">{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref><ref group="Note">Azhdaha claims that he was {{Lang|"forged of elemental crystal"|zh=元素结晶创生之物|zh_tl=born from elemental crystallization,}} while his design notes mention that he is of the same species as Geovishaps.</ref> The dragons of [[Natlan]] believed that the souls of all dragons arose from light, of which one of the highest manifestations was the Primal Flame, or [[phlogiston]].<ref name=Eye>{{Ref/Item|Ignited Seeing Eye}}</ref>  The ancestry of all vishaps, and thus presumably all dragons, is directly descended from the [[Fontemer]].<ref>{{Ref/VO|Neuvillette|Interesting Things: Vishaps}}</ref> As elemental beings, they have far longer lifespans than mortals and even [[gods]].<ref name="ZL2-4" /> They typically grow more powerful with age, and several dragons are known for having enough strength to rival the likes of [[Archon]]s and other similarly powerful beings. Such dragons include Azhdaha,<ref name="ZL2-4" /><ref name="LL">{{Ref/HEO|Hidden in Nameless Treasures}}</ref> Dvalin,<ref name="BAtF1"/> and [[Durin]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Archon's Rival}}</ref> However, other dragons like [[Ursa the Drake]] can be felled by powerful [[Vision]] or [[Delusion]]-bearers.<ref name="Manga1-1">{{Ref/Manga|1|1|pg=12}}</ref>

According to [[Kukulkan]], the dragons of Natlan subsisted on the land due to phlogiston-rich soils which the [[Heavenly Principles]] and its human colonists regarded as "Holy Soil".<ref name=Omen>{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref> This term however has previously been applied to the infertile soils of [[Watatsumi Island]] affected by the Light Realm, so it is almost certainly the case that all dragons in Teyvat in fact subsisted on similar "Holy Soils".<ref name=Moon-Bathed>{{Ref/Quest|The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest)}}</ref> 

Dragons are not immune to erosion and are still subjected to the rules of the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="ZL2-4" /> However, some fully-fledged dragons (such as [[Neuvillette]] and Natlan's [[Thirteen Sovereign Lords]]) are not suspectible to some of the Heavenly Principles' rules, such as destiny.<ref name=Neuvi5>{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|5}}</ref><ref name=CouncilRecords>Interactable, Chamber of Deliberation: [[Chamber_of_Deliberation#Chamber_of_Deliberation:_Sovereign_Rulers'_Council_Records_2|Sovereign Rulers' Council Records, No. B-CL-13097]]</ref> Vishaps and elemental dragons in particular are also extremely susceptible to the darkness of the [[Void Realm]].<ref name="The Eve"/>

===Vishaps===
{{Main|Vishaps|Dragonheir of the Depths}}
{{Lang|Vishaps|zh=龙蜥|zh_lit=Dragon-Lizard}} are reptilian creatures who have existed since primeval times. They are believed to develop into dragons after long periods of time,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Fossilized Bone Shard}}</ref> such as how Azhdaha is from the Geovishap species.<ref name="Azhdaha Design" /> Some vishap species, such as the [[Geovishap]]s, are able to absorb elemental energy from the [[Ley Line]]s, and some vishap species, such as the [[Bathysmal Vishap]]s, are even capable of elemental divergence through evolution, allowing them to inherit more and better combat-related characteristics than their predecessors. However, this evolution has severe consequences for their race &mdash; namely, the fact that they are no longer elementally "pure" and thus cannot have one of the Seven Sovereigns be born among them.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Rimebiter Bathysmal Vishap Hatchling}}</ref>

===Saurians===
{{Main|Saurian}}
Saurians are the descendants of the ancient dragons of [[Natlan]], which have diverged into six lineages after being acknowledged by the [[Wayob]] and the [[Night Kingdom]]: [[Tepetlisaur]]s {{Icon/Element|Geo}}, [[Yumkasaur]]s {{Icon/Element|Dendro}}, [[Koholasaur]]s {{Icon/Element|Hydro}}, [[Qucusaur]]s {{Icon/Element|Pyro}}, [[Iktomisaur]]s {{Icon/Element|Cryo}}, and [[Tatankasaur]]s {{Icon/Element|Electro}}. Unlike dragons in other nations, they live alongside the humans of Natlan in peace and are considered equal members of the community. Like Bathysmal Vishaps, they are now considered elementally impure, and the new Pyro Sovereign cannot be born among their ranks.<ref>Interactable, Legendary Tonatiuh: [[Notes Someone Left Behind#Dialogue|Notes Someone Left Behind (II)]]</ref>

Some Saurians are born with a mark called the [[Flamelord]]'s Blessing, which grants them the power of ancient dragons. However, this power is far greater than what modern Saurians can bear; the Wayob and the Night Kingdom also reject this power and refuse to accept these Saurians. As they grow, the power will become more uncontrollable and tear at their bodies, eventually killing them or driving them insane. According to legend, the mark can be removed by bringing [[Golden Entreaty|two tokens]] to the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] and performing a baptism on the affected Saurian. However, not a single tribal warrior has succeeded, and the tribes gradually abandoned this custom, simply taking care of the Saurians until they die.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Manqu}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of the Bold}}</ref>

===Wenut===
{{Main|Wenut}}
[[Wenut]] are serpentine {{Anemo}}-wielding creatures found exclusively in the [[Great Red Sand]] and said to be the scions of the {{Dendro}} Dragon, [[Apep]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|page=The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears|quote=Liloupar: It's nothing... Ah, the children of Apep, reduced to this...}}</ref> This means they would have inherited Vishap status from their progenitor, though it is said that they have undergone extensive evolution to survive in their changed habitat after the [[Celestial Nail]] fell,<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|page=Setekh Wenut}}</ref> meaning they might not be considered Vishaps anymore.

===Melusines===
{{Main|Melusine}}
Melusines are the "daughters of [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]]" created during a [[Arkhe|Pneumousia]] explosion inside Elynas's corpse, during a clash between the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] and the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]] over 400 years ago. They are considered to be a new form of Hydro Vishap or "dragonheir" in multiple instances,<ref name=":0">{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|3}}</ref><ref name=":1">[[Sigewinne]]'s Character Title: Wondrous Dragonheir</ref> taking the form of young girls with features resembling sea slugs. However, they may be aligned more with the Void Realm than the Light Realm, due to the [[abyss]]al nature of their progenitor.<ref name=":2">{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (V)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Breacher Primus}}</ref>

===Elemental Dragons===
{{Lang|Elemental dragons|zh=元素之龙}} have not been well-documented, although several examples exist: Dvalin<ref name="BAtF1" /> and the Seven Sovereigns<ref name="The Eve">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref> are explicitly called elemental dragons, while Azhdaha is an elemental dragon by deduction.<ref name="Azhdaha Design" />

Elemental dragons and ley lines will affect each other. Dvalin's rampage sent [[Mondstadt]]'s elemental flow and ley lines into disarray, which forced the [[Knights of Favonius]] to cut off his connection to the other three of the [[Four Winds]]' temples.<ref name="AQ0-1-8" /><ref group="Note">The term translated as {{Lang|"elemental sphere"|zh=元素流动}} in ''Knights of Favonius'' is translated as "elemental flow" in the rest of the game, which is a more accurate translation.</ref> Powerful Geovishaps are capable of drawing energy from ley lines.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Revived Primo Geovishap}}</ref> Azhdaha planned to absorb the energy from the entire world's ley lines and use it to destroy everything after freeing himself from the [[Dragon-Queller]],<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Jiu}}</ref> and at the start of his boss fight's second phase, he draws energy from the ley lines through his limbs.<ref name="Azhdaha Design" /> Likewise, when human mining at [[The Chasm (Subregion)|the Chasm]] damaged the ley lines, it brought Azhdaha physical agony.<ref name="ZL2-4" />

It is unknown whether non-elemental dragons exist, as all natural-born dragons named in the game have an elemental affiliation. Durin was created through alchemy and may not be subject to normal dragon physiology, while Ursa the Drake only appeared in the [[Manga]] and little detail went into its background or abilities.

==History==
According to legend, dragons were the dominant species of the old world and were led by the Seven Sovereigns and the Dragon King [[Nibelung]]. In ancient times, Nibelung met a [[voyager|scribe]] amidst the stars, who offered to take him away from Teyvat, which like all worlds, was doomed to inevitable entropic destruction. Nibelung refused, resolving instead to lead all his people to the stars together.<ref name=DistantPact>{{Ref/Arti|Deep Gallery's Distant Pact}}</ref> Subsequently, the society of the dragons developed advanced technology such as the [[Secret Source Automaton]]s, astronomical observatories,<ref name=Watchtower>{{Ref/Location|Ancient Watchtower}}</ref> artificial intelligences,<ref name=Core>{{Ref/Item|Gold-Inscribed Secret Source Core}}</ref> vast megacities, holograms, virtual spaces, artificial stars, space elevators, and microscopic computronium matter in the form of [[Phlogiston]].<ref name=Omen />

When the Heavenly Principles descended, it waged war against the Seven Sovereigns and, after forty years of battle, emerged victorious with the help of its [[Four Shades]]. It began recreating the world to pave the way for humanity, while those who refused to capitulate, such as the Bathysmal Vishaps, fled into the oceans.<ref name="BSaM" /> Some of the Seven Sovereigns survived, such as the Pyro Dragon [[Xiuhcoatl]], who was frozen in lava,<ref name=Omen /> and the Dendro Dragon [[Apep]], though their elemental authorities were presumably stolen and later used to create the divine thrones of the Archons.

The Holy Soil upon which the dragons depended was destroyed by the agricultural practices of human settlers arriving on Teyvat. This was used by the Heavenly Principles to suppress the dragons; due to their ability to adapt to any environment, the removal of phlogiston from the soil forced them to "regress" into smaller forms incapable of human speech or organized resistance.<ref name=Omen /> This is shown by the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]] ritual taught by [[Orobashi]] in Inazuma, and the "Essence of Sacrifice" and [[Grainfruit]] gifted to humans by [[Yohualtecuhtin]] in Natlan.<ref name=StoneTablet>Interactable, [[Ancestral_Temple#Damaged_Stone_Tablet_(IV)|Ancestral Temple: Damaged Stone Tablet (IV)</ref>

Since then, dragons have often come into conflict with denizens of the [[Human Realm]], including humans and gods. Ancient gods and dragons have "never seen eye-to-eye,"<ref name="BAtF1" /> and on the rare occasion that gods, humans, and dragons have managed to coexist, later circumstances would drive rifts between dragons and those of the Human Realm.<ref name="Unforged" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Prologue}}</ref> However, the majority of dragons that had been reborn were now free from the hatred they once harbored against gods and humans,<ref name="NadidaSQ2">{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref> thus mostly ending the feud between them apart from a select few.

Ancient Natlan was originally ruled by dragons led by the Pyro Sovereign [[Xiuhcoatl]], who alongside the [[Thirteen Sovereign Lords]] oversaw their empire from the [[Ancient Sacred Mountain]]. They made use of the Secret Source as their source of power. His brother, the dragon sage [[Kukulkan]], foresaw the fall of the dragon race, due to their reliance on brute strength to maintain positions of power, and believed that salvation could only be found by sharing their wisdom with other races.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Reckoning of the Xenogenic}}</ref> He stole a seed of [[Phlogiston]] from a scion of Xiuhcoatl<ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Hanan Pacha}}</ref> and traveled the world, eventually coming across humans, whom he taught how to use Phlogiston after witnessing their tenacity, unity, and courage. Seeking the path of evolution, and intending to merge the two species of dragon and human as one, Kukulkan told the people to expect the arrival of a "savior of two worlds," who would one day slay Xiuhcoatl and become the next Pyro Dragon.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Root of the Spirit-Marrow}}</ref> He intended this savior to be his son [[Och-Kan]], a dragon mixed with a human soul who would be raised among the human tribes, and an heir of the Flamelord's Blessing.<ref name="MoA">{{Ref/Quest|Moment of Awakening}}</ref>

Instead, [[Xbalanque]] slew Xiuhcoatl and became the new Pyro Archon. The humans revolted against the dragons, and many of the Sovereign Lords were slain during the siege of Tollan. In the end, only one of these lords remained, albeit imprisoned in a phlogiston bracelet and implied to not like the form they were in.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Once, the Sacred Seat of Judgment}}</ref>

===The Archon War===
In [[Liyue]], Azhdaha's awakening caused the earth to tremble with every movement he made. [[Morax]] approached him, seeking to stop the earth's shaking, and managed to befriend the dragon for some time,<ref name="Unforged" /> with the dragon even participating in the [[Archon War]] on Morax's behalf. However, later on, a combination of erosion and human mining at the Chasm caused Azhdaha to forget his friends and his love for humanity. Azhdaha lashed out and attacked the Chasm, destroying the settlement at [[Tianqiu Valley]] in the process.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Trails in Tianqiu}}</ref> Morax chose his duty to protect humanity and personally went to the mines to subdue him. The Geo Archon's power alone was insufficient to overpower the eroding dragon, and he needed the help of [[Moon Carver]], [[Mountain Shaper]], and an unnamed adeptus to create a domain that would be able to seal Azhdaha away. Even then, Azhdaha willingly allowed himself to be sealed.<ref name="ZL2-4" /><ref name="LL" />

In [[Inazuma]], the serpent god [[Orobashi]] fell into [[Enkanomiya]] and eventually became its people's god, subduing the Bathysmal Vishaps which had harassed the humans and further empowering the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]].<ref name="PS2021-12-26">PlayStation Blog: [https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/26/genshin-impact-version-2-4-brings-grand-celebrations-and-a-mysterious-new-area-to-teyvat/ Genshin Impact version 2.4 brings grand celebrations and a mysterious new area to Teyvat]</ref> It personally led research into Bathysmal Vishaps and their evolution. In the process, Orobashi and the researchers eventually came to the conclusion that vishaps naturally rejected Orobashi's power because they came from different realms, although they eventually succeeded in grafting Orobashi's coral onto vishaps.<ref name="Enkabook5">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|5|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records}}</ref> These coral fragments are necessary for the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]], a ritual that prevents [[Watatsumi Island]] from being absorbed by the Elemental Realm.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Moon-Bathed Deep}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Still Water's Flow}}</ref>

As a result of the Bathysmal Vishaps' "impure" evolutions into {{Cryo}} and {{Electro}} forms, this caused a prophecy to claim that the [[Hydro Dragon]] would be reborn in a human form.<ref name="Enkabook5"/>

In [[Sumeru]], Apep, the Dendro Sovereign, was corrupted by [[King Deshret]]'s body. Apep allowed Deshret to build a kingdom in her lands in return for her consuming his body for his knowledge when he died, but King Deshret died with [[Forbidden Knowledge]], causing great anguish to Apep as she had to muster all of her strength to survive, unable to analyze the knowledge acquired.<ref name="NadidaSQ2"/>

In [[Fontaine]], the Hydro Dragon was the "first heart" of the [[Primordial Sea]] and had absolute command over it.<ref name="FWings">{{ref/Item|Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters}}</ref> However, the Hydro Dragon perished in the battle of the Seven Sovereigns against the Heavenly Principles. To replace the Hydro Dragon's duty as the heart of the Primordial Sea, the [[Four Shades#Shade of Life|Shade of Life]] created [[Egeria]].<ref name="FWings"/> Later on, when Egeria was imprisoned by the Heavenly Principles due to her sin of turning [[Oceanid]]s into humans, the Dragon Prince [[Scylla]] was tasked to guard her prison. When [[Remus]] sought Egeria for the solution of the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophecy]], Scylla was impressed with Remus's plan and chose to follow him to [[Remuria]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|The Grand Jape of the Turning of Fate}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Gradus ad Capitolium}}</ref> When [[Phobos]] went rogue, Scylla was supposed to control the surge of power according to Remus's plan, but he failed to show up after being trapped by [[Boethius]]. Remuria sank underwater and Scylla was sealed in [[Initium Iani]].

In Natlan,<ref group="Note">It can be assumed that Xbalanque lived during the end of the Archon War, as he became the Pyro Archon shortly after he killed Xiuhcoatl, similar to the other Archons being awarded with Archonhood following the end of the conflicts in their respective regions. The period of warfare described in [[Crown of the Saints]] also matches with various descriptions of the Archon War.</ref> Och-Kan was imprisoned at some point. A man named [[Xbalanque]] showed him great compassion, and after Och-Kan was freed and accepted by his old tribe, he vowed his loyalty to Xbalanque.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Delirious Decadence of the Sacred Lord}}</ref> During the people's war against the dragons, Och-Kan used his knowledge of the draconic language to decipher [[Iridescent Inscription]]s for the human warriors. He found great satisfaction in using the skills he learned from the dragons against them, and his hatred for dragons was so great that it even concerned his allies.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Delirious Desolation of the Sacred Lord}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Pyro Dragon Xiuhcoatl, who had grown weak and decrepit from abyssal corruption, began laying waste to Old Natlan and its ley lines. Xbalanque fought him at the Great Volcano of Tollan<ref name="TRA">{{Ref/Quest|The Road Ahead}}</ref> and pierced the dragon's eyes, one of which was split in two and became the [[Golden Entreaties]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Golden Entreaty (Moment of Awakening)|note = Description}}</ref> Both Xbalanque and Xiuhcoatl fell from a great height during the battle. While Xiuhcoatl died, Xbalanque was wreathed in fire and revived, and went on to become the first [[Pyro Archon]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Revelations from the Past}}</ref><ref name="MOA"/>

===After the Archon War===
Sometime after [[Barbatos]] became the Anemo Archon and god of [[Mondstadt]], the newborn sky dragon Dvalin appeared before him, enamored by his music. Barbatos sang songs of Dvalin's beauty and befriended the dragon, later naming him the Dragon of the East of the Four Winds.<ref name="BAtF1" /><ref name="AQ0-2-3">{{Ref/Quest|That Green Fellow}}</ref>

Around 1,000 years ago, Ursa the Drake lurked around Mondstadt, occasionally threatening the [[City of Mondstadt]]. Ten years before her rebellion, [[Vennessa]] and her tribe, having wandered far from their homeland, were attacked by the dragon and fled to Mondstadt. Although they were taken in, they were promptly enslaved by the corrupt [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]]. When Vennessa stood up to [[Barca Lawrence]] on [[Venti]] &mdash; who, unbeknownst to them, was Barbatos' mortal disguise &mdash; the Lawrence scion retaliated by purchasing Vennessa and her entire tribe, and forcing Vennessa to win successive gladiatorial battles for their freedom. The Lawrences, however, had no plans on letting Vennessa win; in exchange for peace, they negotiated with Ursa the Drake to sacrifice Vennessa and her tribe to it. In the middle of the battle, Venti revealed his true identity and drove Ursa away.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|0}}</ref>

At an unknown specific time, after Egeria exited hibernation in the deep sea, the new incarnation of the Hydro Sovereign, [[Neuvillette]], was born.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Last Day of Remuria|quote = '''Monsieur Os''': Well, "fell dragon" was the name they gave, but it was no more than a Vishap that was a teensy bit stronger than normal. After all, no new Hydro Dragon could be born so long as the Mistress of Many Waters hibernated in the deep sea.}}</ref> He was born in a human form, as foretold by the Enkanomiyan prophecy, and lacked the full powers and memories of his predecessor, since the Ancient Dragon's Authority was still separated from him as an Archon's Divine Seat.

After Xbalanque entered the [[Sacred Flame]], Och-Kan assumed leadership of [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|Ochkanatlan]] in his stead. Though the people awaited a successor to Xbalanque, Och-Kan believed that Xbalanque should remain the one and only god and became obsessed with eliminating all possible threats to the people, inadvertently becoming a tyrant in the process. He eventually broke the commandments that Xbalanque left behind regarding the peaceful coexistence of humans and dragons,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Delirious Demeanor of the Sacred Lord}}</ref> hunting down dragons and imprisoning [[Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L]] within a stone statue. Despite the existence of the [[Grand Alliance]], he began consolidating his power as the sole leader and believed that having multiple rulers only led to internal strife. He used [[Turnfire]] to oppress anyone who opposed him,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Mysterious Visitor From Huitztlan}}</ref> eliminating any possibilities of revolt.<ref>Interactables: [[Holy Sovereign's Notes]]</ref> Och-Kan was eventually overthrown by a party of heroes led by the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth]], and presumably fell to his death.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Delirious Divinity of the Sacred Lord}}</ref>

===The Cataclysm===
The [[Khaenri'ah]]n alchemist [[Rhinedottir]] created one of her masterpieces, the artificial dragon Durin. 500 years ago, around the time of the [[cataclysm]], she sent Durin to the surface world; however, he ended up unleashing havoc and destruction upon Mondstadt on his arrival. Hearing the suffering of his people, Barbatos awoke from his slumber and summoned Dvalin to aid him in ending Durin's rampage. The two eventually emerged victorious, slaying Durin over [[Dragonspine]]; however, Dvalin ended up ingesting Durin's poisonous blood and fell into a deep slumber in [[Stormterror's Lair|the ruins of Old Mondstadt]] to recuperate.<ref name="BAtF1" /><ref name="AQ0-2-3" />

Around 500 years ago, [[Focalors]], the second [[Hydro Archon]], sent Neuvillette a letter to invite him to the [[Court of Fontaine]] and serve as its Iudex.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|In a New Light|note = Cutscene Summary}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}</ref> Neuvillette agreed, hoping to find the answer to his existence and his lost memory.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|4}}</ref><ref>Youtube: [https://youtu.be/be1_VYIKpFI Character Teaser - "Neuvillette: Watcher in the Deep"]</ref>

===Present Day===
Four years before the events of the game, on [[Diluc]]'s eighteenth birthday, Ursa the Drake was lured into attacking his and his father [[Crepus]]'s caravan.<ref group="Note">When Vennessa faced off against Ursa 1,000 years ago, it was much larger than her and only fled after Venti directly ordered it to leave. By comparison, the Ursa faced by Diluc, Crepus, and later Dottore four years ago is much smaller. Whether Ursa weakened and shrank over time, or if the two are entirely different dragons of the same species, is left unknown.</ref> Their entire retinue was slain and Diluc was defeated by the dragon when Crepus intervened, using a Delusion to repel the dragon. However, the Delusion's power backfired on him; he died shortly afterwards,<ref>{{Ref/Manga|7}}</ref> either from the Delusion itself<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|3}}</ref> or by Diluc killing him to spare him the agony.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaeya|5}}</ref> Sometime afterwards, [[Il Dottore]] visited Mondstadt and personally slew Ursa, thus indebting Mondstadt to the [[Fatui]].<ref name="Manga1-1" />

During the events of the {{Quest|Prologue}}, the [[Abyss Order]] sought to weaponize Dvalin in their plans to destroy the nations of Teyvat and eventually, [[Celestia]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/SO__VQZirJ4 Story Teaser: We Will Be Reunited]</ref> However, their plot was eventually foiled by the combined efforts of Venti, the [[Traveler]], [[Jean]], and Diluc. Freed from the poisonous blood that put him in physical agony and freed from the Abyss Order's lies, Dvalin rekindled his friendship with Venti and became Mondstadt's ally once more.

Azhdaha, through the artificial vessel [[Jiu]], attempted to break Morax's seal at the Dragon-Queller by having miners chip away at the seal from outside, while Azhdaha overpowered it from within. The plan was eventually thwarted when [[Zhongli]], the Traveler, and [[Kun Jun]] &mdash; who was unknowingly possessed by a fragment of Azhdaha's consciousness that retained his goodwill towards humanity &mdash; investigated the miners' disappearance and stumbled upon the plot. After a hard-fought battle, Azhdaha's body was resealed, while his spirit went dormant again.<ref name="ZL2-4" />

[[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], who was supposed to take care of Apep, had initially forgotten about her task due to her tampering of [[Irminsul]] to remove forbidden knowledge.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises}}</ref> The removal of the forbidden knowledge ended up creating a large void in Apep's body, and by the time Nahida had remembered her task, Apep was on the verge of death, which would unintentionally destroy Sumeru with its abundance of energy. Apep was successfully saved by Nahida and two elemental beings taking the form of elemental [[fungi]] that had escaped Apep's body during the cataclysm. The two fungi, and all the others' consciousness of the same species that they were carrying, sacrificed themselves to restore the Heart of Oasis in Apep's body. Although remaining distrustful of the gods and humans, Apep elected to simply watch them to see how far they could go under the Heavenly Principles.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Homecoming}}</ref>

During the events of {{Quest|Masquerade of the Guilty}}, Neuvillette recovered his authority as part of Focalors's plan to divert the prophecy and save the people of Fontaine. As the Iudex, he declared them innocent of their original sin, granting them the true properties of humans due to his absolute control over {{Hydro}} and the Primordial Sea, ensuring that they would not be dissolved when the second flood came.

Prior to the Traveler's arrival in Natlan, [[Kinich]] would discover [[Ajaw]] in some underground ruins. Realizing the threat he would pose if left unchecked, he made a deal with Ajaw to let him out as long as he controlled the use of his powers, which Ajaw agreed to as long as he would possess Kinich's body when he passed away.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kinich|5}}</ref>

While exploring the ruins of [[Ochkanatlan]], the Traveler and [[Paimon]] were attacked Och-Kan's body, which had been completely transformed into [[Dragon of the City of Flowing Ash|a full dragon]] and used as an Abyss conduit by Kukulkan. Och-Kan's body stole the [[Golden Entreaty (Moment of Awakening)|Golden Entreaty]] from them, but later merged with [[Cocouik]] &mdash; his surviving consciousness &mdash; and fought the Traveler as Cocouik purged the abyssal poison from his body. After the battle, Och-Kan recognized [[Little One]] as a fellow bearer of the Flamelord's Blessing and entrusted the Golden Entreaty to him. He shared his memories of the past with the Traveler before finally passing away.<ref name="MOA"/> The Traveler and Little One would later head to the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] and entered the ancient city within the [[Ancient Sacred Mountain]]. There, they discovered remnants of the dragons' society and eventually Little One came face to face with Kukulkan, who asked him to activate the [[Huitzilopochtli]] array. Little One declined, wishing to protect the Traveler and destroyed a [[Primeval Source Dragon Mech]] that was threatening the Traveler. As they left, Kukulkan faded away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref>

* In the Chinese version of {{Quest|Rite of Descension}}, [[Ivanovich]] states that Morax's Exuvia is allegedly a cross between two of Liyue's divine creatures: an Eastern dragon and a [[qilin]]. The English version does not specify what two creatures it is based on.
** In Liyue folklore and media, Morax is often depicted as a dragon, using a form nearly identical to his Exuvia's.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|One for the Foodies, Two for the Show|q='''Xiangling:''' The body of a dragon? The stories about Rex Lapis say the same thing.}}</ref>
* Although [[Haishan]] is never explicitly called a dragon, [[Beidou]]'s epithet in the Chinese version is {{Lang|Dragon Lord|zh=龙王}}, which is translated in the English localization as the "Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean." The exact origin of this byname is unclear, but it is likely related to her slaying of the leviathan.
* In the Chinese text, powerful, antagonistic dragons have been dubbed {{zh|魔龙|tl=Demon/Evil/Magic Dragon}}; this is usually translated as "evil dragon," reinterpreted, or left out of the English localization entirely. Dragons who have been called by this phrase currently include:
** Azhdaha, by [[Linlang]]<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Hidden in Nameless Treasures|note = Chinese only, used as part of a sentence rather than a title}}</ref>
** Durin, by [[Iris (Dragonspine Adventurer Camp)|Iris]]<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Iris (Dragonspine Adventurer Camp)}}</ref>
** Dvalin, in his epithet {{Lang|Stormterror|zh=风魔龙|zh_tl=Wind Demon Dragon}}
** Ursa the Drake, whose Chinese name is {{zh|魔龙乌萨|tl=Demon Dragon Ursa}}
** Och-Kan's body, as the {{Lang|Dragon of the City of Flowing Ash|zh=流灰之城的魔龙}}
* The following have been described as "dragon-like," but are never directly or explicitly linked to dragons:
** Baqiu, a behemoth of a sea monster that Morax fought against in ages past.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Primordial Jade Winged-Spear|note=Chinese}}</ref> In Chinese mythology, a {{Lang|Qiu|zh=虬}} is a type of horned dragon; {{Lang|Baqiu|zh=八虬}} was thus likely an eight-horned dragon-like monster.
** The [[Chi]], another type of sea creature in the Liyue region. Morax defeated one that took over Mt. Qingce,<ref>{{Ref/Book|Diary of Roald the Adventurer|2|Qingce Village}}</ref> while the [[Skipper]] defeated another one and turned its spine into the [[claymore]] [[Serpent Spine]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Serpent Spine}}</ref><ref group="Note">The Chinese name for Serpent Spine is {{zh|螭骨剑|tl=Chi Spine Sword.}}</ref>
** Orobashi is, on one occasion, described as a "dragon-like serpent god."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Miyazaki Saburou}}</ref>
** Elynas, described as a "great beast" and whose remains in the Beryl Region somewhat resemble those of large draconic beasts. The children of Elynas, the Melusines, are referred to as "dragons" or "vishaps" on numerous occasions,<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> and Elynas' flesh and blood is described by [[Rene]] as having the same properties as Durin.<ref name=":2" />
** Conversely, Fontainians have never been described as dragon-like, but as beings born from the Primordial Sea, they are considered forms of life requiring the Hydro Dragon Neuvillette's care.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|5}}</ref>
