|zh_note = Based off a Chinese acrostic poem {{Lang|zh=离合诗|zh_rm=lí hé shī}} by Three Kingdoms poet {{w|Kong Rong}}, the full line reads {{zh|六翮将奋，羽仪未彰|tl=six {{w|pennaceous feather}}s are about to flutter, yet the wings have yet to spread}}. When standing on its own, the phrase "six pennaceous feathers" {{Lang|zh=六翮}} refers to a bird's two wings. Additionally, the number "six" mentioned in the title may also be a reference to the fact that there are six in-game characters available during the event.
