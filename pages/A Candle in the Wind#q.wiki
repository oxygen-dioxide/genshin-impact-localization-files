==Trivia==
* The Chinese and Japanese names are a reference to a line often said by antagonists in the {{w|Yu-Gi-Oh!}} anime, taunting the protagonists' dangerously low LP (reflected by the achievement's requirement of sustaining damage) and board condition. As this taunt is often answered with a combo that completely reverses the situation, it has since become a meme in the Chinese community.
