'''Rock Piles''' are {{Color|[[Geo Constructs]]}} that can be broken to reveal chests, cave entrances, and other items related to [[Exploration]]. They take a few different forms. Like all Geo constructs, they are most efficiently destroyed using [[Blunt Attack]]s.

The most common version is the Large Rock Pile,<ref name="OIM">Official Interactive Map: [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=73,72 Teyvat].</ref> appearing as a mound of round rocks, usually leaning against cliffs or obstructing hidden caves. Breaking it typically reveals a chest or another hidden object.

Another version of this object is the Small Rock Pile,<ref name="OIM" /> appearing as a player-sized tower of rocks, and are most often found in groups. Destroying all Small Rock Piles of an area typically reveals a chest.

While [[Elemental Sight]] is active, breakable rocks will be colored {{Color|Geo|orange}}.
