==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You hear strange sounds &mdash; voices, almost &mdash; coming from a giant mushroom in The Chasm. Could it be... a giant talking mushroom?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon nearing the giant mushroom)
:'''???''': Two-legged One, do not waste daylight or night, or shamble without aim, come here.
:'''Paimon:''' There's no one here! But the mushroom can't be talking... right?
:'''Xamaran:''' Yes, two-legged hatchling who makes no use of her feet, Xamaran calls.
:'''Paimon:''' Seriously? Is the mushroom talking to us?

;(Talk to Xamaran)
:'''Xamaran:''' How curious! This two-legged hatchling makes no use of her feet.
:'''Paimon:''' "Two-legged hatchling"? Hmph, Paimon's got a name! And looks like someone's gonna get themselves the silliest nickname in the world ever!
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon think... You know what, we're gonna call you "Sheeshroom"!
:'''Paimon:''' Also, look at this glowing powder in the air. Are they mushroom spores? Paimon wonders if they're the reason why we could hear this mushroom talking.
:'''Xamaran:''' Xamaran knows many legged ones who make no use of their feet. Yet Xamaran knows not any Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's natural, because Paimon is one of a kind.
:'''Xamaran:''' Xamaran knows the two-legged one over there. How strangely familiar.
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), do you know Sheeshroom?
:{{DIcon}} No, I don't.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe I do, but I don't remember.
:'''Xamaran:''' Xamaran smells the heat of golden sand and the dampness from deep within the rainforest. That's the smell of Xamaran's hometown.
:'''Paimon:''' Hot sand and the rainforest? Do you mean [[Sumeru]]? We did just talk to a [[Khedive|Sumeru scholar]] at the camp...
:'''Xamaran:''' Although Xamaran has been away from its hometown for long, Xamaran makes no mistakes.
:'''Xamaran:''' (Traveler) the Two-Legged, fate has brought you here. Xamaran has a favor to ask.
:'''Xamaran:''' Xamaran has dwelled here for many a year and found it a cozy and comfy home...
:'''Xamaran:''' Yet foul energy is growing lately. Xamaran has been drained of strength fending off the evil and has ended up in this state. Xamaran must seek help from the two-legged.
:'''Paimon:''' Sheeshroom does look a little under the weather...
:'''Paimon:''' Hm... Oh right, (Traveler), we can lend the energy of the Adjuvant to Sheeshroom, perhaps? Maybe that'll make it feel better.

----

;(Give Xamaran some of the Adjuvant's power)

:'''You lend the energy of the Adjuvant to Xamaran.'''

:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Sheeshroom is glowing. Should Paimon call it a "Shiningroom" now?
:'''Xamaran:''' Hail (Traveler)! Hail Paimon!
:'''Xamaran:''' Thanks to (Traveler), and thanks to Paimon also! Xamaran life-light is rekindled!
:'''Xamaran:''' But do not let your guard down yet. Xamaran knows that the foul energy is not yet eradicated. It could strike back at any time.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Then what do we do!?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Where did all this black mud come from? Is it the "foul energy" that Sheeshroom talked about?

:'''Paimon:''' Guess we can just clear the dark mud out first.

;(Talk to Xamaran again)
:'''Xamaran:''' Xamaran knows that the foul energy has yet to be eradicated. Two-legged one, please lend Xamaran your strength.

----

;(Clear out the foul energy at the first spot)
:'''Paimon:''' Done! Next spot!

;(Clear out the foul energy at the second spot)
:'''Paimon:''' This should do it! That leaves just one more place!

;(Clear out the foul energy at the third spot)
:'''Paimon:''' There! There should be no more problems for a while!

----

;(Tell Xamaran that the foul energy has been cleansed)
:'''Xamaran:''' Hail (Traveler)! Hail Paimon!
:'''Xamaran:''' None answered Xamaran's call for help. The many-legged and four-legged paid no heed, and the two-legged turned a deaf ear.
:'''Xamaran:''' Only the wise would answer. Paimon proved to be one with wisdom, and (Traveler) did, too.
:'''Xamaran:''' You two, wisest of the two-legged, shall receive Xamaran's gratitude.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, Paimon the Wise is not to be taken lightly!
:{{DIcon}} It was no trouble.
:'''Xamaran:''' Given time, (Traveler) and Paimon will rise to become as great as Xamaran and its kin. This Xamaran knows for sure.
:'''Paimon:''' Hang on, what is that supposed to mean?
:'''Xamaran:''' The many-legged are inferior to the four-legged, and the four-legged are inferior to the two-legged, so naturally, the two-legged are inferior to the legless.
:'''Xamaran:''' But what (Traveler) and Paimon lack by nature, you can make up for through hard work. You might even be able to change the course of fate one day.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, this glowing mushroom's talking super big! Paimon wonders if glowing mushrooms make good cooking ingredients...
:{{DIcon}} For [[Chicken-Mushroom Skewer]]s, surely.
:{{DIcon}} Beautiful mushrooms lie. This one could be poisonous.
:'''Xamaran:''' A glutton, this Paimon is. A bite on the mushroom today, another bite tomorrow, and a hundred days later, there shall be no Paimon left in Paimon, but only mushrooms.
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, Sheeshroom's starting to talk all creepy, (Traveler)...
:'''Xamaran:''' Ah, so you failed to see the humor in that. A shame.
:'''Paimon:''' That wasn't funny at all!
:'''Xamaran:''' Xamaran is cleared of the foul energy, yet its kin still suffer. Xamaran lacks the strength now to shelter the weak like it once did.
:'''Xamaran:''' Please, (Traveler), Xamaran begs of you. Exercise your benevolence and save the defenseless.
:'''Paimon:''' Do you mean there are more ill mushrooms? (Traveler), let's help 'em, shall we?
:{{DIcon}} Now that we're here...
:{{DIcon}} As long as it's not a big detour.
:'''Paimon:''' Then let's be off!

----

;(Help Xamaran's kin)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, signs of life! Let's go look for other little mushrooms that need our help!

;(Help Xamaran's kin)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, this one's looking good too! Let's go find the rest!

;(Help Xamaran's kin)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoo! It's all lit up like Sheeshroom! Let's go find the others.

;(Help Xamaran's kin)
:'''Paimon:''' Yup yup, this one looks healthier already. Any other little mushrooms that need our help?

;(Help Xamaran's kin)
:'''Paimon:''' That should do it. Now let's go back and look for Sheeshroom.
----
;(Talk to Xamaran)
:'''Xamaran:''' Hail (Traveler)! Hail Paimon!
:'''Xamaran:''' If Xamaran may be so bold, you Two-Legs do have a saying: "A helping hand must see things to the end."
:{{DIcon}} You mean more errand-running, huh?
::'''Xamaran:''' Amongst Two-Legs, you two do indeed deserve the title of "The Wise."
:{{DIcon}} But do human sayings really apply to mushrooms?
::'''Xamaran:''' We are both living beings bathing in the blessings of the earth. It's natural for us to help each other out.
:'''Xamaran:''' Please take this &mdash; the Blessings of Wisdom.

:'''You obtain the Blessings of Wisdom.'''

:'''Paimon:''' Wow... What's this? It looks kinda suspicious, actually...
:'''Xamaran:''' Xamaran can smell the lingering scent of foul energy in the air but cannot tell where its source lies. Follow the water and you shall find it.
:'''Xamaran:''' You merely need to use the [[Blessings of Wisdom]] on the source, (Traveler), and Xamaran's kin will take care of the rest.
:{{DIcon}} The source of the foul energy... That's indeed something that can't be left unattended.
:{{DIcon}} ...But why don't you deal with it yourself?
:'''Xamaran:''' (Traveler), you are far more humorous than Paimon. Xamaran doesn't have legs whereas you do. As one of the legless, Xamaran shan't meddle too much with the matters of the Two-Legs.
:'''Xamaran:''' What's more, Xamaran has a greater duty to perform.
:{{DIcon}} A greater duty?
:'''Xamaran:''' Xamaran has spent too much strength. It was a pleasant conversation with you two, but Xamaran must rest now and gather the strength to fend off evil and provide a shelter for its kin to prosper.
:'''Xamaran:''' (Traveler) and Paimon, may you be blessed on your journey ahead.
:'''Xamaran:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Sheeshroom! Wake up!
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), looks like Sheeshroom has gone to sleep. Well, let's head off then.
;(Obtain [[Blessings of Wisdom]] ×1)
----
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|You may find the source of the foul energy Xamaran describes by following the water<!--sic missing period-->}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Follow the water's flow and search for the source of the foul energy)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, this should be what Sheeshroom called "the source of the foul energy." Sheeshroom said that we just need to use the Blessings of Wisdom thing, and their kin will "take care of the rest."
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't know what that means, but let's try it anyway!
----
;(After using the Blessings of Wisdom on the source of the foul energy)
:'''A mushroom grows out from within the fissure...'''

:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's how they'll solve it!
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! We're all out of Blessings of Wisdom...
:'''Paimon:''' But looks like the fissures have been blocked off. Let's go back and tell Sheeshroom the good news!

----
;(Tell Xamaran that the foul energy's source has been cleared out)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Sheeshroom, we're back. We've run out of your &mdash; um, what do you call it &mdash; oh, your Blessings of Wisdom.
:'''Paimon:''' But we've managed to block the fissures. Now the problem has been solved!
:'''Xamaran:''' Hail (Traveler)! Hail Paimon!
:'''Xamaran:''' May no regrets linger in the night bygone. May all shadows fade ere the dawn to come.
:'''Xamaran:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Seems Sheeshroom has fallen asleep again. Let's not disturb it.

;(Talk to Xamaran after the quest ends)
:'''Xamaran:''' ...Ignorance might be a blessing, and knowledge might bring forth calamity...
:'''Xamaran:''' ...Only that which graced with the ambrosia of knowledge can flourish into the strong...
:'''Xamaran:''' ...Only that which has been tested with the desolation of wandering can brave the wilderness...
