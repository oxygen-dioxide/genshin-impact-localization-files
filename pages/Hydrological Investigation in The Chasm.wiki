{{Quest Description|You fish up something strange in The Chasm. What in the world could it be? According to the Sumeru scholar Khedive, just place it by the water and you will discover its secret...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon fishing up the [[Strange Object]])
:'''Paimon:''' Feels like we've fished up something weird. Can this even be eaten? Let's ask someone back at camp.
----
;(Talk to Khedive)
:'''Khedive:''' What a curious geological environment we're in now! I'm sure I can outdo the research goals set by the Akademiya this year.
:'''Khedive:''' Oh, Traveler, what's up?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} About the strange object...
:'''Khedive:''' Did you fish this up from the water? Hmm. Actually, at first glance, this thing does look like a fishing bait.
:'''Khedive:''' Is it normal for people to come across this kind of stuff while fishing? Anisa never misses a single day fishing on Watatsumi Island, but she's never discovered anything special.
:'''Khedive:''' Perhaps it's the fisher that makes the difference, then?
:'''Khedive:''' Let me check. Mm, I can sense an incredibly high concentration of Hydro energy within it.
:'''Khedive:''' The groundwater in The Chasm does contain unusually rich elemental power. Does that have anything to do with things like this growing within it?
:'''Khedive:''' But ever since you fished it up, its elemental energy has been ebbing away. Maybe we need to place it by the water to see what its power is capable of.
:{{DIcon}} Place it by the water?
:'''Khedive:''' Yes, and also activate it with Hydro energy. I suspect that it'll reveal its secrets to us then.
:'''Khedive:''' How about you go activate it? &mdash; I mean, since you're the one who fished it up and all. Let me know if you get any results.
:'''Khedive:''' I'll pay you if your findings are of academic value.
----
;(Place the strange object by the water and use Hydro reactions to activate it)

;(Defeat the Hydro Geovishap that emerged)
:'''Paimon:''' We just put that thing by the water for a moment, and whoosh, out swam a Geovishap!
----
;(Tell Khedive about what happened by the water)
:'''Khedive:''' What a curious geological environment we're in now! I'm sure I can outdo the research goals set by the Akademiya this year.
:'''Khedive:''' Oh, Traveler, what's up?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} About the strange object by the water...
:'''Khedive:''' Huh? Have you placed it by the water?
:'''Khedive:''' How is it? Did anything special happen?
:{{DIcon}} A Geovishap showed up.
:'''Khedive:''' A Geovishap? It turned into a Geovishap in the water!?
:'''Khedive:''' Oh, you mean that it didn't turn into a Geovishap, but rather, attracted one over.
:'''Khedive:''' My heart almost stopped there! If it really had turned into a Geovishap, my whole world-view would have been shattered.
:{{DIcon}} So what exactly is that thing?
:'''Khedive:''' The answer is simple. How should I put it? Mmm, well why don't you tell me first if there was anything special about that Geovishap?
:'''Khedive:''' Did it, say, wield Hydro?
:{{DIcon}} Something like that.
::'''Khedive:''' That's about right.
:{{DIcon}} I didn't notice it.
::'''Khedive:''' You must've taken it out too quickly to notice its special trait. How impressive, as expected of the legendary (Traveler).
::'''Khedive:''' But here's my hypothesis...
:'''Khedive:''' That Geovishap is probably able to use Hydro.
:'''Khedive:''' The groundwater in The Chasm contains dense Hydro energies. As such, certain high-concentration spots have become the nurturing grounds for the waterweed-like object that you fished up.
:'''Khedive:''' The Geovishap &mdash; and other water-loving creatures in The Chasm, too &mdash; has increased its power by feeding on these waterweeds that are rich in Hydro.
:'''Khedive:''' So that thing is... just some waterweed rich in Hydro elements!
:{{DIcon}} Just some waterweed, huh...
:'''Khedive:''' Yep, waterweed &mdash; only that it contains exceedingly dense Hydro elemental energy.
:'''Khedive:''' You don't usually find it in ordinary environments &mdash; unless some immense, pure power has altered the source of the water... Forget it, these waterweeds...
:'''Khedive:''' It could turn into sentient elemental beings one day. You know what? This would make a fine research topic.
