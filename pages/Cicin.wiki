'''Cicins''' are [[Common Enemies]] found across Teyvat. They appear as small bat-like creatures.

In combat, Cicins make up for their low [[HP]] with agility and the ability to fly, and attack by firing elemental bolts at the player. When summoned by [[Fatui Cicin Mage]]s, they will perform certain special attacks.

==Trivia==
* The English name "Cicin" derives from Latin ''{{Lang|mini=1|la=cicindela}}'' which means "firefly" or "glowworm."
** In real life, the genus ''{{w|Cicindela}}'' refers to the common tiger beetles, which are generally brightly colored, metallic beetles.
