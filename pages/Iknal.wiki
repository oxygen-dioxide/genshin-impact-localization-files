==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Iknal:''' Its name is the "Strongest and Most Steadfast Berserker in All the World."
:{{DIcon}} I&mdash;I'm sorry, what?
::'''Iknal:''' It's a name... the name of my tool.
::'''Iknal:''' "Steadfast" describes its tenacity, "Berserker" praises its strength, and "Strongest" reflects my utmost faith in its abilities.
::'''Iknal:''' Names are important vessels of symbolism in Natlan, so my most trusted tool deserves a most glorious name of its own.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about those names...
::'''Iknal:''' You've heard of "[[Ancient Name]]s," right?
::'''Iknal:''' Powerful warriors chosen by the [[Wayob]] will be granted an Ancient Name, engraved upon obsidian stone.
::'''Iknal:''' This means that the warrior has been acknowledged to have the ability to inherit the legacy of all the heroes who have carried this name before, and will follow the paths of their predecessors to fight for Natlan.
::'''Iknal:''' The Wayob has never been wrong. Ancient Names are precious, and each will be bestowed upon a warrior who is worthy of the title.
::'''Iknal:''' Speaking of, do you have a tool or weapon that always comes in handy? Why don't you also give it a name? Surely, it's earned one for itself.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Let's name it "The Strongest Sword."
::'''Iknal:''' Not bad. A concise name, yet filled with ambition. That's a good principle...
::'''Iknal:''' I've also got a pretty high-quality hammer at home which I was planning on calling the "Saurian Claw Succulent." Looks like I'll have to reconsider that name now.
::; Obtain {{Item|Saurian Claw Succulent|x=4}}
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Iknal:''' Mhm.
