===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

{{Description|A monster born from highly-concentrated Cryo elements that can float in the air.<br>[[Timaeus|A certain alchemist]] once studied these beings, speculating that they might be a kind of [[Slime]] or the [[Traveler]], as none of the above needed a Vision to use the elements. He was reprimanded by [[Albedo|his teacher]].}}
