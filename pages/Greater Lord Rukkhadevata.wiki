'''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata''', also known as '''Queen Aranyani''' by the [[Aranara]],<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Arakarman|note=Queen Aranyani's Story}}</ref> was the original [[Dendro Archon]] of [[Sumeru]],<ref name="C3A1P2 with collei">{{Ref/Quest|Further Observation}}</ref> the avatar of [[Irminsul]],<ref name="boat">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref> and the predecessor to the current Dendro Archon, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. Like her successor, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata held the title of [[God]] of Wisdom.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=503 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 8m 23s)</ref>

Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was once one of "The Three Eternal Companion-Gods" who co-reigned in Sumeru, alongside [[King Deshret]] and [[Nabu Malikata]].<ref name="DEF2">{{Ref/Quest|Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part II}}</ref> When the other two gods propagated a plan to turn against [[Celestia]], Rukkhadevata chose not to stay by their sides and instead established her own territory by nurturing a rainforest with the [[Varuna Contraption]].

During the [[cataclysm]] five hundred years ago, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was one of the casualties of the conflict.<ref name="boat" /><ref group="Note">Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's conclusion that she died 500 years ago is supported by [[Viridescent Venerer's Determination]]'s claim about the death of the God of the Woods during "the disaster," which [[In Remembrance of Viridescent Fields]] specifies as the cataclysm.</ref> Before her death, she created the [[Akasha System]] to purge [[forbidden knowledge]] from Irminsul and created her next incarnation, Lesser Lord Kusanali,<ref name="boat" /> who then ascended as the current Dendro Archon and God of Wisdom.<ref name="AQ1-3-3">{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

At the end of the Sumeru [[Archon Quest]]s, Rukkhadevata sacrifices herself by having Lesser Lord Kusanali remove all memories of her existence from [[Teyvat]]. The only known person to still clearly remember her is the [[Traveler]], which they believe is because they are not from Teyvat, and thus their memories are not under Irminsul's jurisdiction.

==Story==
===Pre-Cataclysm===
After the war between the [[Seven Sovereigns]] and the [[Heavenly Principles]] concluded, one of the [[Celestial Nail]]s cast by the Heavenly Principles to mend the land<ref name="Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown">{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref> devastated and transformed most of verdant Sumeru into the desert now known as the [[Great Red Sand]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Shadow of the Sand King}}</ref> The nail suppressed the Dendro Dragon [[Apep]], forcing it to adapt to the desert's environment.<ref name="Shape">{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref> It is unknown when or how Greater Lord Rukkhadevata came into being, but in the earliest legends involving her, she was the princess of an area where the forest still thrived,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Feast of Boundless Joy|quote=Forsaking mad love and majesty, she [Rukkhadevata] chose to return to the rainforest and take up the path of defending life...}}</ref> which may be due to an alleged divine presence.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Scroll of Streaming Song|1}}</ref>

[[Nabu Malikata]], a [[Seelie]] survivor, heard about Rukkhadevata's wisdom and was impressed by the princess' answers to her riddles. The two forged an alliance which also included [[King Deshret]],<ref>{{Ref/Book|Scroll of Streaming Song|3}}</ref> who was co-ruling [[Ay-Khanoum]] with Nabu Malikata<ref>{{Ref/Item|Oasis Garden's Mourning}}</ref> and chose to "share" his throne with them during the [[Archon War]],<ref name="Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown"/> leading the three to be known as "The Three Eternal Companion-Gods";<ref name="DEF2" /> the three had their own views on "wisdom" and often debated their ideas together.<ref name="Deepwood">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Deepwood Memories}}</ref> For a period of time, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata co-reigned with them in the desert, with each focusing on a different aspect of their civilization, and this era was remembered by their subjects as one of peace and ease.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Honeyed Final Feast}}</ref> To this day, a chair with Rukkhadevata's name inscribed on it can be found in [[the Orchard of Pairidaeza]].

At some point, Nabu Malikata foresaw the coming of the [[cataclysm]] and realized that humanity might not survive on its own, so she informed Rukkhadevata of the future she saw and entrusted the other goddess with "a part of herself," a [[Khvarena]] of flowers.<ref name="VouruGlow">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Vourukasha's Glow}}</ref> For her own part, the Goddess of Flowers understood and embraced her own fate &mdash; to die leading King Deshret on the path of understanding forbidden knowledge, despite knowing that his endeavors were futile, in hopes of one day overturning the Heavenly Principles.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Flower of Paradise Lost}}</ref> Hearing of their plans and finding them unacceptable, Rukkhadevata broke ties with both of them and returned to the forest to pursue her own ideas of wisdom. Though Nabu Malikata waited for her to return, she never did, leaving King Deshret to rule his people alone following the Goddess of Flowers' death.<ref name="Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III"/><ref>{{Ref/Item|Olden Days of Scorching Might}}</ref>

====Revitalization of the Forest====
After her falling out with King Deshret and Nabu Malikata, Rukkhadevata created the [[Varuna Contraption]] in a section of the desert,<ref>{{Ref/Domain|The Coordinates of Sun and Rain|note=Chinese version|quote={{zh|依照传说，司草木的女神在沙漠的一角唤出能召来甘霖的精灵，名之曰「法留纳」亦即「水天」。|tl=According to legend, the goddess who controlled plants summoned, in a part of the desert, a spirit of sweet rains, whose name was Varuna, or 'Water-Sky.'}}}}</ref> after which the moonlight's reflection off the water created the image of a labyrinth. This labyrinth gave birth to the tiger-like divine beast<ref>{{Ref/Wildlife|Rishboland Tiger}}</ref> [[Viaghara]], the first lord of the forest, who proceeded to befriend Rukkhadevata.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Laurel Coronet}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Silver Talisman of the Forest Dew}}</ref> After Rukkhadevata created the [[Aranara]], small plantlike creatures with the ability to control dreams,<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Sumeru|Aranara}}</ref> the Aranara and lords of the forest used "dreams and illusions" and "hedges and streams," respectively, to protect the Varuna Contraption.<ref>{{Ref/Domain|The Coordinates of Sun and Rain}}</ref>

With the help of her followers, who would go on to establish the [[Amurta]] Darshan of [[Sumeru Akademiya]], Rukkhadevata revived a flourishing rainforest and expanded it furthermore. [[Sumeru City]] was built on the [[Divine Tree]], a particularly massive tree located in Sumeru's forest region, and the sages of Sumeru Akademiya assisted Rukkhadevata in managing the nation's affairs.<ref name="Version 3.0 Special Program">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=474 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 7m 54s)</ref> At the border between the forest and the desert, the [[Wall of Samiel]] was erected to prevent the forest from undergoing desertification.

====Suppression of Forbidden Knowledge====
Thousands of years ago,<ref name="Trail">{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref> after King Deshret and Rukkhadevata had parted ways, King Deshret's pursuit of his ideal world led him to inadvertently release forbidden knowledge into his kingdom.<ref name="Staff">{{Ref/Weapon|Staff of the Scarlet Sands}}</ref> People heard crazed whispers in their heads and the disease known as [[Eleazar]] &mdash; the manifestation of [[The Withering]] on human bodies &mdash; began to spread.<ref name="SSD">{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>

After learning of the plight of Deshret's people, Rukkhadevata came to their aid on account of her old friendship with Deshret.<ref name="Staff" /> She gathered the people,<ref name="The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin"/> instructing them to build temples into which she infused the divine power of life to suppress the forbidden knowledge. Doing so expended a great deal of her power and caused her to regress into a childlike form. Even this, however, was not enough &mdash; in the end, King Deshret sacrificed himself to finally put an end to the outbreak.<ref name="SSD" />

Although King Deshret's people were saved, the sudden death of their god led to the fall of Deshret's civilization, whose stability had already been strained by [[Liloupar]]'s orchestrated destruction of the large vassal state of [[Gurabad]]. Its people were divided into numerous short-lived city-states, including [[Tulaytullah]], [[Saleh]], and a state named after the original Gurabad.<ref>{{Ref/Item|The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle}}</ref><ref>Interactables: [[Vaguely-Readable Inscription]]s</ref> During this time, the fox-like race known as the [[Valuka Shuna]], which had been King Deshret's subjects, only managed to survive due to Rukkhadevata's grace and they moved into the rainforest. In the process, their fur also turned green and those with darker fur have exceptionally low heat tolerance.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Tighnari|Character Story 5}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Competition on the Sands|quote='''Tighnari:''' My ancestors, the Valuka Shuna, were originally from the desert. But I guess this is what happens when a species migrates — they become intolerant of their original environment...}}</ref>

After the end of the desert's city-states era,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Ancient Abscission}}</ref> Rukkhadevata reconstructed the Khvarena entrusted to her by the late Nabu Malikata into the divine bird [[Simurgh]]. She tasked Simurgh with guarding "the border between new birth and death."<ref name="VouruGlow" />

During her weakened state, Rukkhadevata also made a promise with one of [[Apep's Creatures]] to completely erase the "apocalypse" &mdash; the assimilation of forbidden knowledge inside Apep and its creatures, which had occurred due to Apep's consumption of King Deshret's forbidden knowledge-corrupted body following his death. She blessed the creature with enough life force for it to survive in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|The Chasm]], where forbidden knowledge is "transformed" due to the power of the Celestial Nail residing there. She predicted that if forbidden knowledge was eradicated, Apep's creatures, which had "become" the apocalypse, would also lose a part of themselves. By changing the forbidden knowledge into something else, they would still remember it. She and Apep's creatures created the Fire Seed, which could reactivate the Heart of Oasis inside Apep and cure the dragon. However, since she was weakened, the Fire Seed was unstable.<ref name="Shape"/>

===The Cataclysm===
Five hundred years before the start of the main story, [[Khaenri'ah]]'s increasing use of forbidden knowledge culminated in an overflow of [[Abyss]]al powers and monsters into Teyvat.<ref name="SplendorousSky">{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day|quote='''Nasejuna:''' Long, long ago, Dahri [Khaenri'ah] once built a facility here that connected them to realms beyond.<br>'''Nasejuna:''' During the great disaster, which they say the Dahri started, monsters swarmed from that very facility into the nations of the world.<br>'''Nasejuna:''' The monsters tore open a great rift that came to be called the Tunigi Hollow, and though they were sealed away with the new vein of the ancient tree, this mysterious sign appeared along with that.}}</ref> These Abyssal monsters wreaked havoc on the land under [[Celestia]]'s control and the Withering spread uncontrollably throughout both the forest and the desert, causing decay and destruction so terrible that it was called "The Black Tide."<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Folio of Foliage|1}}</ref>

To put an end to the devastation, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata embarked on a final journey with some of her followers and never returned.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Folio of Foliage|2}}</ref> The final king of the forest perished defending the forest,<ref name="Deepwood" /> while the Aranara only managed to save the forest with the help of the [[Traveler's sibling]], whom they refer to as "Nara Varuna" due to their assistance in protecting the Varuna Contraption.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Festival Utsava}}</ref> As a result of Rukkhadevata's death, the "grass and trees never spoke again" to [[Viridescent]].<ref name="VV sands">{{Ref/Arti|Viridescent Venerer's Determination}}</ref>

During the gods' battle at [[Tunigi Hollow]], the main rift where the Abyssal creatures emerged from,<ref name="SplendorousSky" /> they successfully suppressed the power of the Abyss &mdash; at a price.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/B3twe5LbGrQ?t=1300 Version 3.6 Special Program] (Timestamp: 21m 40s)</ref><ref group="Note">It is not confirmed that The Seven were summoned to Tunigi Hollow to fight Khaenri'ah, although multiple gods were present: Egeria died here, and Rukkhadevata is assumed to have been present in order to transform the Lord of Amrita's corpse into the seal over Tunigi Hollow.</ref> When the former Hydro Archon [[Egeria]] was killed,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Vibrant Pinion}}</ref> her remains formed the water called [[Amrita]]. Rukkhadevata grew the [[Harvisptokhm]] from it to anchor the previous Hydro Archon to the mortal realm,<ref name="Splendorous">{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref> and it maintains the seal on the Abyssal rift by absorbing the defilement emanating from it. Inside the Harvisptokhm lies the giant lotus Gaokerena,<ref group="Note">The term "Gaokerena" is also mentioned in ''[[The Folio of Foliage]]'' Vol. 2 as the name of either Rukkhadevata's remains or the culmination of the Dendro Archon's wisdom, but it is unlikely to have any intended overlap with the Harvisptokhm's Gaokerena. In fact, the Sumeru Archon Quests state that Rukkhadevata mysteriously disappeared and the sages never found her, even though ''The Folio of Foliage'' allegedly records the stories told by the sages who followed her.</ref> within which the deceased Hydro Archon's consciousness slumbers. Simurgh awoke from slumber and fulfilled her destiny, drinking from the Amrita and turning into countless motes of [[Khvarena]], sacrificing herself to purify the Amrita from the taint of the Abyss. The thousands of specks of Khvarena she turned into created various lifeforms, including the [[Pari]] race.<ref name="Splendorous" />

It is suggested that Rukkhadevata already died by the time Simurgh completed its sacrifice.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Stamen of Khvarena's Origin|quote="The lord of sweet dew and the lord of grass and trees shall precede you in losing their divine forms..."<br>"They shall be forgotten, and only the memory of your sacrifice will be remembered."}}</ref> At the moment of her death, Rukkhadevata was at [[Irminsul]], which she had been tasked with protecting. Unlike the other members of The Seven, Rukkhadevata was not summoned to participate in the war against Khaenri'ah, since protecting Irminsul was a more important task. The pollution of forbidden knowledge occurred alongside the disaster, and it had already invaded Irminsul and caused great distress to Rukkhadevata. She created the [[Akasha System]] to "borrow" her citizens' wisdom in the form of their dreams to aid her in solving the crisis, and used her divine strength to purge the forbidden knowledge, much like how she once drove it back during the incident with King Deshret thousands of years ago. However, she realized that because she was the avatar of Irminsul, when forbidden knowledge corrupted Irminsul, it had corrupted her very existence as well. Even if she died, she would live on in memories, and this meant that Irminsul could not be fully purified of forbidden knowledge contamination. Because it was impossible for Rukkhadevata to erase herself, she created [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] from the purest branch of Irminsul to be her incarnation in the "next samsara," leaving a trail of clues starting with the phrase "Let the world completely forget me."<ref name="boat" />

===Legacy===
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was remembered as a goddess who had protected Sumeru "since time immemorial" by dealing with disasters and creating the rainforest so that the people of Sumeru could live in peace. Some of her most devoted followers who were researchers founded [[Sumeru Akademiya]] and assisted her in ruling Sumeru.<ref name="Version 3.0 Special Program"/> The Akasha System, which was powered by the Dendro [[Gnosis]],<ref name="boat" /> was considered her legacy; it was modified by the Akademiya at some point after her death to become the public information-retrieval service utilized across [[Sumeru City]].<ref group="Note">[[Il Dottore]]'s quote about the "Gnosis of Sumeru" likely confirms that Rukkhadevata's Gnosis and Lesser Lord Kusanali's Gnosis, which had varyingly been cited as the Akasha's power source in [https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03] and the Sumeru Archon Quests, are the same item.</ref> <ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=540 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 9m 0s)</ref> While Lesser Lord Kusanali had her reservations about the Akademiya's use of the Akasha, she believed it was Rukkhadevata's wish to see it taken to its maximum potential and thus did not interfere with its affairs until the sages enacted their Samsara plan during the [[Sabzeruz Festival]].

The Akademiya greatly idolized Rukkhadevata &mdash; or at least, the wisdom that they believed she personified. After Rukkhadevata's disappearance, the sages searched for her. They found Lesser Lord Kusanali, who bore a great physical resemblance to their former Archon, and brought her back to Sumeru City. Initially, the people rejoiced at her discovery and changed the [[Sabzeruz Festival]]'s date to commemorate Kusanali's birthday. However, after some examination, the sages found that Kusanali was barely any different from an ordinary human child; she had no great wisdom nor the strength of a god. Disappointed in their new god, the sages locked her up in the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]] and greatly reduced their focus on the new god in favor of espousing Rukkhadevata's legacy.<ref name="SSD" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dawn (Quest)}}</ref>

The device in the Sanctuary of Surasthana where Nahida was imprisoned was created by Rukhadevata as a space where she could meditate in peace. After her death, the sages reprogrammed the machine so that it could only be controlled from the outside, then placed the young god inside it. Because the dungeon was created by divine power, Nahida was unable to escape on her own.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Jnagarbha Day|quote='''Alhaitham:''' That isn't something they could've accomplished with their scholarly talents alone. In the Sanctuary of Surasthana, there's a device of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's that she once used to isolate herself while meditating.<br>'''Alhaitham:''' Five hundred years ago, the Grand Sage at the time modified the device so that it can no longer be controlled from the inside. They're effectively trapping one god with the power of another.}}</ref>

Over time, and partially due to the Akademiya's misinformation campaign, the people of Sumeru have forgotten the true history between Rukkhadevata and Deshret. Some believe that a battle between the two was what created Sumeru's desert, and fanatic followers of Deshret view Rukkhadevata as a traitor who betrayed him and took the place of Archon. This perversion of the truth has allowed the sages to maintain tight control over information in Sumeru by pitting the people of the forest against the Eremites, making it easy for the sages to manipulate both groups from behind the scenes.<ref name="SSD" />

Over the course of the Sumeru Archon Quests, the [[Traveler]] becomes entangled in the nation's affairs when their quest to gain audience with Lesser Lord Kusanali leads them to the [[Divine Knowledge Capsule]], which was extracted from scholars who had come into contact with Rukkhadevata's consciousness. After learning about the sages' treatment of Nahida, their ambition to create a fake god, and the [[Fatui]]'s involvement, the Traveler resolves to help free Nahida and find a way to end the Withering crisis. After the Traveler defeats the faux god [[Joururi Workshop|Shouki no Kami]], Nahida obtains the Electro Gnosis that had been in [[Scaramouche]]'s possession and uses it to enter Rukkhadevata's [[realm of consciousness]], which contains her final memories. After reaching the Irminsul where Rukkhadevata's remnant is located, Nahida realizes the purpose for which she was created. Despite her unwillingness to, Nahida has no choice but to eliminate Rukkhadevata from Irminsul to completely remove forbidden knowledge. Afterwards, the consequences of forbidden knowledge (crazed whispers, [[The Withering]], and [[Eleazar]]) disappear, but Rukkhadevata herself is written out of history, as if she never existed in the world. While she still existed, no one remembers her and all references to her are rewritten to refer to a generic "Lord of Verdure," which people understand to be a pre-amnesiac Nahida.<ref name="boat" /><ref name="toast">{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref> The only individual who still remembers Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is the Traveler, a [[Descender]], although Nahida has mentioned that she instinctively feels as though there was someone before her.

After the removal of the forbidden knowledge, Nahida finally fulfills Rukkhadevata's promise from thousands years ago with Apep's creatures and saves Apep from illness.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Homecoming}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Rukkhadevata is the second god shown to regress into a physically smaller form after imbuing her power into the land (or in her case, towers).<ref name="SSD" /> The first known case is [[Guoba]], who as Marchosius, God of the Stove and Patron God of the Soil, "placed all of his power into the land itself" to quell the disasters and calamities that threatened it. Divested of his strength, he shrank to his current size and fell into a deep slumber, during which he lost most of his wits, memories and wisdom. After he awoke, few people realized he was a god until it was revealed during the events of [[Moonlight Merriment]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go}}</ref>
** Rukkhadevata is the first god indicated to have placed her power into the land twice and shrunk accordingly: The first was to remove forbidden knowledge after King Deshret released it to his civilization, which changed her appearance from an adult's to a child's.<ref name="SSD" /> The second likely occurred during the cataclysm when she had to remove forbidden knowledge from Irminsul, causing her appearance to regress to an even younger child's, identical to Nahida in stature.<ref name="boat" /> When Nahida and the Traveler encounter the [[Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom]], it asks her, "Wait, did you... get smaller again?"<ref name="Shape"/>
* While talking with [[Citlali]] about outliving others during her [[Tribal Chronicles]], without naming names the Traveler confides via mind reading that not only are they much older than they look, but implies that there was someone on Teyvat of which their memory of her is the sole proof that they ever existed.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Please, great shaman!|quote=<br>
'''Citlali:''' You won't live as long as me, so you don't have to worry about that.<br>
{{DIcon}} Actually, I might have a long lifespan...<br>

===Etymology===
*{{Lang|''Rukkhadevatā''|pi=रुक्खदेवता|pi_tl=tree-goddess}} in {{W|Shaivism}} is a {{W|Yakshini|Yakṣiṇī}} who is worshiped as the goddess of wealth or the guardian spirit of practitioners. The Yakṣiṇīs are the female counterparts of the [[Yaksha]]s in Hinduism and Buddhism, and also appear in Jātaka literature, where they are considered as local deities living in trees and sometimes referred to individually as "''rukkha-devatā''".
*In Hinduism, {{Lang|{{w|Aranyani|''Araṇyānī''}}|sa=अरण्यानी}} is a goddess of the forests and the wild animals that inhabit them. As the name derives from the word {{Lang|''araṇya''|sa=अरण्य|sa_tl=forest, wilderness}}, araṇyānī can also refer to a "large forest."<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/aranyani Aranyani, Araṇyāni, Araṇyānī: 9 definitions]</ref>
