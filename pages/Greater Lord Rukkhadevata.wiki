'''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata''' was the original [[Dendro]] [[Archon]] of [[Sumeru]]<ref name="C3A1P2 with collei">{{Ref/Quest|Further Observation}}</ref> and the predecessor to the current Dendro Archon, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. Like her successor, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata held the title of God of Wisdom.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=503 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 8m 23s)</ref>

Greater Lord Rukkhadevata passed away during the [[cataclysm]] five hundred years ago.<ref name="boat" /><ref group="Note">Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's conclusion that she died 500 years ago is supported by [[Viridescent Venerer's Determination]]'s claim about the death of the God of the Woods during "the disaster," which [[In Remembrance of Viridescent Fields]] specifies as the [[cataclysm]].</ref> Before her death, she created her next incarnation, Lesser Lord Kusanali,<ref name="boat" /> who then ascended as the current Dendro Archon and God of Wisdom.<ref name="AQ1-3-3">{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

In order to truly cure [[Irminsul]], Rukkhadevata sacrificed herself by removing all memories of her existence from [[Teyvat]]. The only known person to still remember her is the [[Traveler]]. The reason for this is unknown, but it is implied that it is because there is no data of the Traveler in Irminsul.

Prior to all memory of Rukkhadevata being removed from Teyvat, the [[Aranara]] had called her '''Queen Aranyani''' and referred to themselves as her children.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Arakarman|note=Queen Aranyani's Story}}</ref>

==Story==
===Ancient History===
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was once friends with [[Nabu Malikata]] and [[King Deshret]] (Scarlet King), and each had their own views on "wisdom."<ref name="Deepwood">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Deepwood Memories}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|Scroll of Streaming Song}}</ref> Greater Lord Rukkhadevata presumably worked alongside her two friends in governing [[Ay-Khanoum]], the "City of the Moon Maiden."<ref name="Oasis Mourning">{{Ref/Item|Oasis Garden's Mourning}}</ref><ref name="Shepherd">{{Ref/Book|The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle}}</ref> However, as a result of a certain incident, the Goddess of Flowers perished,<ref name="Oasis Mourning" /> and Ay-Khanoum was destroyed when the "first pillar" descended and turned the region into a desert.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Shadow of the Sand King}}</ref>

King Deshret, who had been in love with the Goddess of Flowers, became obsessed with the past.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Lay of Al-Ahmar}}</ref> This eventually caused the Deshret and Rukkhadevata to split ways, and Rukkhadevata decided to pursue her own ideas of wisdom by creating a verdant paradise in the forest.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Olden Days of Scorching Might}}</ref>

===Creation of the Forest===
After her falling out with Deshret, Rukkhadevata created the [[Varuna Contraption]] in a section of the desert<ref group="Note">The Chinese description for The Coordinates of Sun and Rain details: {{zh|依照传说，司草木的女神在沙漠的一角唤出能召来甘霖的精灵，名之曰「法留纳」亦即「水天」。|tl=According to legend, the goddess who controlled plants summoned, in a part of the desert, a spirit of sweet rains, whose name was Varuna, or "Water-Sky."}}</ref> and used "hedges and streams" to protect a certain secret related to "sun and rain."

With the help of her followers, who would go on to establish the [[Amurta]] Darshan of [[Sumeru Akademiya]], Rukkhadevata developed a flourishing rainforest. [[Sumeru City]] was built on the [[Divine Tree]], a particularly massive tree located in Sumeru's forest region, and the sages of Sumeru Akademiya assisted Rukkhadevata in managing the nation's affairs.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=474 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 7m 54s)</ref>

Rukkhadevata also created the [[Aranara]], small plantlike creatures with the ability to control dreams.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Aranara}}</ref>

At the border between the forest and the desert, the [[Wall of Samiel]] was erected to prevent the forest from undergoing desertification. The Lord of Forests, a lineage of "tigers" which began with [[Viaghara]], protected the forest with the help of humans who would learn the secrets of the forest, such as [[Viridescent]].

===Suppression of Forbidden Knowledge===
Thousands of years ago,<ref name="Trail">{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref> while Rukkhadevata was cultivating the forest, Deshret's pursuit of his ideal world led him to inadvertently release forbidden knowledge into his kingdom.<ref name="Staff">{{Ref/Weapon|Staff of the Scarlet Sands}}</ref> People heard crazed whispers in their heads and the disease known as [[Eleazar]] &mdash; the manifestation of [[The Withering]] on human bodies &mdash; began to spread.<ref name="SSD">{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref> This led to the fall of Deshret's civilization and its people were divided into numerous short-lived city-states, including [[Gurabad]], [[Tulaytullah]], and Saleh.<ref name="Shepherd" /><ref>Interactables: [[Vaguely-Readable Inscription]]s</ref>

After learning of the plight of Deshret's people, Rukkhadevata came to their aid on account of her old friendship with Deshret.<ref name="Staff" /> She gathered the people,<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin|1}}</ref> instructing them to build temples and creating [[Aaru Village]] as the last bastion of Deshret's civilization. She also expended a great deal of her power to suppress forbidden knowledge and regressed into a childlike form. Even this, however, was not enough &mdash; in the end, Deshret sacrificed himself to finally put an end to it.<ref name="SSD" />

===The Cataclysm===
Five hundred years before the start of the main story, a bitter struggle between [[Khaenri'ah]] and those who lived under [[Celestia]]'s control, including the denizens of the surface of Teyvat's Seven Nations and the Archons who ruled over them, as well as an attack by [[Abyss]]al monsters, wreaked havoc on Teyvat. The Withering spread uncontrollably throughout both the forest and the desert, causing decay and destruction so terrible that it was called "The Black Tide."<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Folio of Foliage|1}}</ref>

To put an end to the devastation, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata embarked on a final journey with some of her followers. She ultimately descended to the heart of the land, which the Abyssal creatures had made their dwelling and turned it into "a cavern of the damned where neither sun, moon, nor fire shine."<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Folio of Foliage|2}}</ref> Rukkhadevata never returned from her journey, while the final Lord of Forests perished in defense of the forest.<ref name="Deepwood" /> As a result of Rukkhadevata's disappearance, the "grass and trees never spoke again" to [[Viridescent]].<ref name="VV sands">{{Ref/Arti|Viridescent Venerer's Determination}}</ref>

It is later confirmed that she was not actually summoned to participate the war against Khanenri'ah; instead, she had a mission to protect [[Irminsul]]. The pollution of forbidden knowledge occured alongside the disaster, and it had already invaded Irminsul and caused great distress to Rukkhadevata. She created the [[Akasha System]] to "borrow" her citizens' dreams and wisdom, and used her own strength the second time to clear the forbidden knowledge, like how she did it with King Deshret thousands of years ago. However, she realized that the forbidden knowledge caused corruption to her mind as well, as she was the avatar of the world tree. She realized that her existence must be eliminated, because her existence was still present in Irminsul even after death. Before her demise, Rukkhadevata prepared for her [[Lesser Lord Kusanali|next incarnation]] by cultivating the purest branch of Irminsul, and left a trail of clues, "Let the world completely forget me."<ref name="boat">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref>

It is unlikely that Rukkhadevata personally met the [[Traveler's sibling]]. The Traveler's sibling befriended the Aranara during their journey after the cataclysm and repaired the Varuna Contraption, which saved the rainforest from destruction. The Aranara have known them ever since as "Nara Varuna."

===Legacy===
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was remembered as a goddess who had protected Sumeru "since time immemorial" by dealing with disasters and creating the rainforest so that the people of Sumeru could live in peace. Some of her most devoted followers who were researchers founded [[Sumeru Akademiya]] and assisted her in ruling Sumeru.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=474 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 7m 54s)</ref> The [[Akasha System]], which was powered by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's [[Gnosis]],<ref name="sumeru teaser 3">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03: Prelude to Wisdom]</ref> was considered her legacy.<ref group="Note">While it is called Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's legacy and is stated to be her Gnosis in ''Sumeru Preview Teaser 03'', the Archon Quest ''[[Secret of the Scorching Desert]]'' claims it is Lesser Lord Kusanali's Gnosis that powers the Akasha instead.</ref> It has since been reformed by Sumeru Akademiya into its current form.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=540 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 9m 0s)</ref> While [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] had her reservations about the Akademiya's current use of the Akasha, she believed it was Rukkhadevata's wish to see it taken to its maximum potential and thus did not interfere with its affairs until the sages enacted their Samsara plan during the [[Sabzeruz Festival]].

The Akademiya greatly idolized Rukkhadevata &mdash; or at least, the wisdom that they believed she personified. After Rukkhadevata's disappearance, the sages searched for her. They found Lesser Lord Kusanali, who bore a great physical resemblance to their former Archon, and brought her back to Sumeru City. Initially, the people rejoiced at her discovery and changed the [[Sabzeruz Festival]]'s date to commemorate Kusanali's birthday. However, after some examination, the sages found that Kusanali was barely any different from an ordinary human child; she had no great wisdom nor the strength of a god. Disappointed in their new god, the sages locked her up in the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]] and greatly reduced their focus on the new god in favor of espousing Rukkhadevata's legacy.<ref name="SSD" />

Over time, and with the help of the Akademiya's misinformation campaign, the people of Sumeru have forgotten the true history between Rukkhadevata and Deshret. Some believe that a battle between the two was what created Sumeru's desert, and fanatic followers of Deshret view Rukkhadevata as a traitor who betrayed him and took the place of Archon. This perversion of the truth has allowed the sages to maintain tight control over information in Sumeru by pitting the people of the forest against the Eremites, making it easy for the sages to manipulate both groups from behind the scenes.<ref name="SSD" />

The duty of protecting the "secret of sun and rain" has since fallen to the Aranara, who use dreams and illusions to create a labyrinth with a similar effect to Rukkhadevata's original hedges and streams.<ref>{{Ref/Domain|The Coordinates of Sun and Rain}}</ref>

In present day, after the [[Traveler]] and co. frees Kusanali and then defeats the faux god [[Joururi Workshop|Shouki no Kami]], Nahida now has two Gnoses and can finally understand the final memory of Rukkhadevata. After the painful realization, Nahida is forced to eliminate Rukkhadevata from Irminsul to completely remove the forbidden knowledge. As a result, the consequence of the forbidden knowledge (crazed whispers, [[The Withering]], and [[Eleazar]]) disappeared, but Rukkhadevata herself is forgotten, as if she never existed in the world. While she still existed, no one can remember her, and all references to her are rewritten.<ref name="boat" /><ref name="toast">{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref> The only individual that still remembers Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is one of the [[Descender]]s, the Traveler.

==Trivia==
* Rukkhadevata is the second god shown to regress into a physically smaller form after imbuing her power into the land (or in her case, towers).<ref name="SSD" /> The first known case is [[Guoba]], who as Marchosius, God of the Stove and Patron God of the Soil, "placed all of his power into the land itself" to quell the disasters and calamities that threatened it. Divested of his strength, he shrank to his current size and fell into a deep slumber, during which he lost most of his wits, memories and wisdom. After he awoke, few people realized he was a god until it was revealed during the events of [[Moonlight Merriment]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go}}</ref>
** It is revealed during {{Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}} that Rukkhadevata created Kusanali as her next incarnation, born from a branch of Irminsul, which Rukkhadevata is the avatar of. Rukkhadevata refers to Kusanali as "her in the next samsara".<ref name="boat" />
* She and [[Haypasia]] both share an English voice actor, with the two being voiced by Chloe Eves.

===Etymology===
*{{Lang|''Rukkhadevatā''|pi=रुक्खदेवता|pi_tl=tree-goddess}} in {{W|Shaivism}} is a {{W|Yakshini|Yakṣiṇī}} who is worshiped as the goddess of wealth or the guardian spirit of practitioners. The Yakṣiṇīs are the female counterparts of the [[Yaksha]]s in Hinduism and Buddhism, and also appear in Jātaka literature, where they are considered as local deities living in trees and sometimes referred to individually as "''rukkha-devatā''".
*In Hinduism, {{Lang|{{w|Aranyani|''Araṇyānī''}}|sa=अरण्यानी}} is a goddess of the forests and the wild animals that inhabit them. As the name derives from the word {{Lang|''araṇya''|sa=अरण्य|sa_tl=forest, wilderness}}, araṇyānī can also refer to a "large forest."<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/aranyani Aranyani, Araṇyāni, Araṇyānī: 9 definitions]</ref>
