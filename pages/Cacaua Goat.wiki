|description = These gentle beasts can be found all over [[Teyvat]] and were among the earliest to be domesticated by humans.<br>Contrary to what the name might suggest, Cacaua Goats do not give off a uniquely bitter odor. This unforgettable name originates from the hue of their wool, which closely resembles that of food and drink made from [[Cacahuatl]]. For traditional Natlan dyers, achieving a [[chocolate]] or [[xocoatl]] color is not an easy task, as the slightest mistake might result in a dirty-looking finish like rain-soaked mud. The wool of these robustly-built Cacaua Goats has a smooth texture and a clean, chocolatey tone, which is why they are so highly valued...
