{{Description|Benny's Adventure Team's adventures are always fraught with unexpected danger. However, Bennett is more inclined to call them "journeys full of wonder, excitement, and beauty."}}
'''Fantastic Voyage''' is [[Bennett]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*The ATK increase is given by:
:<math>\text{ATK Bonus Ratio} \% \times \text{Bennett's Base ATK}</math>
:*That is, characters standing within the field can have this amount added to their total ATK. For example, at talent level 10, the bonus ratio is 101% so Bennett's buff will basically add his entire Base ATK to the ATK of characters within the field. Other talent levels will add different portions of Bennett's Base ATK as a bonus (at talent level 1, it will be 56% of Bennett's Base ATK).
* The ATK bonus, alongside a self-inflicted {{Pyro}} status, is applied once every second to all characters in the field. Both the ATK bonus and the Pyro status last for 2 seconds after being applied, even if the affected character leaves its AoE or is switched out.
* The ATK bonus is ''only'' based on Bennett's Base ATK (character ATK + weapon ATK), the white portion of the ATK breakdown on the character [[Attributes]] screen. It excludes other sources of ATK such as flat ATK/%ATK from artifacts. This ATK bonus is also unaffected by any other modifiers on the active character.
*When a character is in the skill's AoE:
**If the character's HP is less than or equal to 70%, they will be continuously healed until their HP is greater than 70%, at which point the healing stops.
**If the character's HP is less than or equal to 70%, the ATK bonus won't be applied. However, since the HP is regenerated at a fast rate, it will eventually be greater than 70%, at which point the ATK bonus will kick in.
* In [[Co-Op Mode]] only the first instance of ''Fantastic Voyage'' will apply its buff and attacks.
