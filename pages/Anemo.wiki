'''Anemo''' is one of the seven [[Elements]] and the first one the [[Traveler]] acquires.

Its associated [[Archon]] is [[Barbatos]], whose domain is [[Mondstadt]].

==Elemental Resonance==
Having two Anemo characters in the group results in the [[Elemental Resonance]]:
* '''Impetuous Winds:''' Decreases [[Stamina]] Consumption by 15%. Increases Movement SPD by 10%. Shortens Skill CD by 5%.

==Elemental Reactions==
{{Color|Anemo}} has [[Elemental Reactions]] with the elements {{Electro}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Hydro}} and {{Cryo}}. Depending on the particular talent, it can Swirl or absorb the element or do both.
* '''[[Swirl]]:''' Deals {{Color|Black|Elemental DMG}} of the involved element while spreading the involved elemental status to nearby enemies.

Many Anemo characters and enemies also have the following skills:
* '''[[Elemental Absorption]]:''' Absorbs an element and becomes infused with that element, dealing damage of that type. The absorbed element can trigger further reactions, including '''Swirl'''.
* '''[[Displacement]] <small>(Crowd Control)</small>:''' The ability to displace mobs of entities by knocking them back or pulling them in. Many Anemo users especially have the ability to create [[Vacuum Field]]s that pull in enemies within a radius.

==Anemo Status==
{{See also|Gauge Unit Theory}}
Similar to the {{Geo}} status, the {{Color|Anemo}} status is ephemeral and will either react immediately with pre-applied elements, or disappear instantly after application if no other elements are applied to an enemy. However, the {{Enemy|Anemo Hypostasis}} applies a long-lasting {{Color|Anemo}} status to itself while its core is exposed, and unlike {{Color|Persistent Geo}} on {{Enemy|Geo Hypostasis}} and [[Planet Befall]] &mdash; it <u>can</u> react with other elements to trigger '''Swirl''', albeit it has an [[Internal Cooldown]] which disallows it from activating '''Swirl''' again before a set amount of time passes.

Additionally, [[Jean]]'s [[Elemental Burst]] &mdash; [[Dandelion Breeze]] &mdash; continuously and periodically applies the {{Color|Anemo}} status to characters that stand in the talent's [[Area of Effect|AoE]] Dandelion Field up until the effect's dissipation. This {{Color|Anemo}} status effect does not behave any differently from a normal {{Color|Anemo}} status effect, and will disappear momentarily after application until the next periodic application occurs by the talent.
