The '''Corps of Thirty''' is the military and peace-keeping force of [[Sumeru City]] hired by [[Sumeru Akademiya]]. They are not an officially institutionalized military, but rather a permanently hired mercenary brigade of the [[The Eremites|Eremites]]. Their headquarters are the barracks stationed at the [[Citadel of Regzar]] in the center of the city.

Their head and military commander is the Parchamdar, currently held by [[Rukh Shah]]. Additionally, the Corps has a secondary administrative leader titled Consultant, currently [[Asfand]].

==Overview==
The Corps of Thirty derives its name from the fact that they were originally a band of thirty members hired by the sages of the Akademiya. They are the oldest of the Eremite brigades, and are responsible for managing and coordinating the affairs of all the other mercenary brigades.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref>

Due to their background, the Corps of Thirty's weaponry and uniforms are near identical to those employed by other Eremites, with the exception of their teal-green scarves instead of the usual crimson-red ones. These scarves are also marked by a different petal-like emblem similar to that of the Akademiya, instead of the Eremite's crossed sword triangle. However, the Eremite crest and colors are still used on their banners near their barracks.

The Corps of Thirty has a somewhat tenuous relationship with the other Eremites, and Rukh Shah warns the Traveler about other Eremites they may encounter elsewhere. [[Alhaitham]] notes their poor relationship with the Ayn Al-Ahmar, devout followers of the [[Scarlet King]] who loudly denounce [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].
