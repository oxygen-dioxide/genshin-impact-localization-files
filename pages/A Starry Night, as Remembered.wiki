{{Quest Description|Jeroney wishes to be able to see the starry sky whenever he wants, so why not take a photo of it for him? Even if it's only the reflection inside the bottle and not the real thing, it will be beautiful enough.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Jeroney)
:'''Jeroney:''' Why are you up here yourself? There isn't even a rail line here, and it's way high up at the very edge of the Mirage.
:'''Jeroney:''' People rarely come here. Even [[Idyia]]... Heh, I doubt she even knows this place exists.
:'''Paimon:''' So if there's nothing here, why are you here, Jeroney?
:'''Jeroney:''' I just came out for a little fresh air... Hey, don't give me that "you ran away from home after arguing with [[Ferdinand]] again" look!
:'''Jeroney:''' Come on, there really wasn't an argument. I'm just taking a stroll out of, well, I don't know, personal interest!
:'''Jeroney:''' I suppose you already knew that the Choo-Choo Cart was my idea. At that time, I was only thinking: What's something that could easily reach great heights...
:'''Jeroney:''' So I... So Jeroney brainstormed the Choo-Choo Cart and the rails, all for the love of the sky and heights.
:'''Jeroney:''' Sounds silly, doesn't it? I remember Inazuma has a saying that goes something like, "only idiots and smoke like to rise up high"...
:{{DIcon}} It's awesome that you could think up the Choo-Choo Cart.
:{{DIcon}} I think it is so much fun.
:'''Jeroney:''' But it can only exist in the Veluriyam Mirage.
:'''Jeroney:''' ...Forget it, let's not talk about it. I also came here to stargaze.
:'''Jeroney:''' I know the stars here are merely an ephemeral shadow from outside the Mirage, but they're pretty enough for me.
:'''Jeroney:''' Every night when I look upon the starry sky... I feel so peaceful.
:{{DIcon}} The one who loves the starry sky... is it Jeroney...?
:'''Jeroney:''' But whoever sees a starry sky like that couldn't help but fall in love with it. If only I could see the stars in the daytime...
:'''Jeroney:''' Or even better, if I didn't have to climb up here every day!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait! That's possible! Paimon's got an idea!
:'''Jeroney:''' Huh? Really?
:{{DIcon}} We can just take a photo...
:'''Jeroney:''' Pho... Photo? That sounds like some advanced technology.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, why don't we take a photo of the starry sky for Jeroney?
:'''Jeroney:''' Can you really do that?
:{{DIcon}} Of course you can!
:'''Paimon:''' But... Paimon isn't sure of any good spots to take pictures of the starry night...
:'''Jeroney:''' Here! At night, on the platform here, you can see the most beautiful starscape! That's the reason I came here in the first place.
:'''Paimon:''' Really? Great! Jeroney, you just wait for our photo!

;(Talk to Jeroney again)
:'''Jeroney:''' Photos... I can't believe something so amazing exists already. Now, it's possible to keep a record of all kinds of amazing scenery...
:'''Jeroney:''' Well, {{Traveler}}, did you finish taking the photo? I'm really looking forward to seeing your photo of the starry sky!

;(Take a photo of the starry sky)<!--Adjust the camera angle to face the starry sky and take a photo-->
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, now this photo really looks good! Let's show it to Jeroney.
:'''Paimon:''' He'll be really surprised when he sees a picture like this!

;(Talk to Jeroney)
:'''Paimon:''' Jeroney, we're back~! See, this is the photo! Check it out!
:'''Jeroney:''' ...Wow, it looks just like what my eyes would see.
:'''Jeroney:''' Are you really giving me this photo?
:'''Paimon:''' Of course, we took it just for you!
:'''Jeroney:''' Haha, thank you... thank you so much. I never thought I'd see such amazing technology. With technology like this, maybe one day we will also be able to build a Choo-Choo Cart outside the Mirage.
:'''Jeroney:''' What a gorgeous night sky... If only we had technology like this back then, then... then he would have been able to see this beautiful sight whenever he wanted.
