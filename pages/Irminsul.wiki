'''Irminsul''' is a type of silver-white tree which grows deep underground, and is connected to the [[Ley Lines]] of the world. It is said that the [[Dendro Archon]]'s consciousness is directly connected to it,<ref name="DendArch">YouTube: ''[https://youtu.be/WIxkKExpu94 Version 3.0 "The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings" Trailer]''</ref> and that it itself is the root of [[Dendro]] power.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in Prosperity}}</ref>

==Overview==
Irminsul is the repository for all of the information and memories of [[Teyvat]],<ref name="toast" /> which are collected via the Ley Lines.<ref name="chronic illness">{{Ref/Quest|Chronic Illness}}</ref> It is unclear exactly how the repository works, as there is no information on the [[Traveler]] in Irminsul by the end of [[Chapter III]]<ref name="toast" /> even though many people in Teyvat know of them. However, the Traveler seems to correctly understand how the repository works.<ref name="toast" />

In Teyvat, Irminsul is connected to Petrified Trees ([[Domains]]), [[Ley Line Outcrops]] and [[Ley Line Blossom]]s, which can be revitalized with [[Original Resin]] or [[Condensed Resin]].<ref name="OrigResin">{{Ref/Item|Original Resin}}</ref><ref name="CondResin">{{Ref/Item|Condensed Resin}}</ref> Irminsul's roots also pierce through the surface in a few select areas of Teyvat.

[[Tighnari]] states that Irminsul grows downwards rather than upwards, from a cavern located deep underground, and that Ley Lines - described as the roots of Irminsul - spread and extend from the cavern all the way to the surface.<ref name="chronic illness" /> Judging from this description, any part of Irminsul that reaches the surface is presumably the very ends of the tree's roots. It's possible that Irminsul itself is located either in or near the [[abyss]], given how branches of Irminsul can be found there,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Prototype Crescent|quote="In the end, he chose to use cudrania wood, fine steel and Irminsul branches brought back from the abyss."}}</ref> and branches would typically be found after falling from/breaking from a tree.

==Removal of Information==
Purging information from Irminsul removes all traces of that information from Teyvat. The purging of information requires power on the level of a god. A being cannot successfully remove itself from Irminsul.<ref name="boat" /><ref name="kabukimono finale" />

To accommodate the loss of information, anything that belongs to the world of Teyvat may be changed, ranging from people's memories to physical objects such as books and letters. However, the overall results and overarching historical impacts remain unchanged. Those who belong to the world of Teyvat, including the Archons, can have their impressions of Teyvat's history altered; they will be unaware of any such changes. Notably, Paimon is also affected.<ref name="boat">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref><ref name="toast">{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref>

Steps can be taken to ensure that lost information is preserved or retrieved, such as abstracting information in a way such that the information "still resonates with the present information recorded in Irminsul."<ref name="kabukimono finale">{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref> The successful preservation and retrieval of information that is purged from Irminsul is presumably difficult to do without the aid of someone who never lost that information, such as the Traveler. To this end, much information could have been purged from Irminsul without anyone remembering (apart from other [[Descender]]s) prior to the Traveler's arrival in Teyvat.

Presumably, the description sections of [[Weapon]]s and [[Artifact]]s are and will not be altered, regardless of information removal. These "lore sections" being nonexistent and only there for gameplay purposes may explain their immunity.

If the information removed is that of an entire being, then the consequences of their actions and existence remain in the world. For example, the rainforests of [[Sumeru]] created by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] remained after she was purged from Irminsul, and the history of the tradition of forest dwellers offering [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]] to [[Sumeru Akademiya]] was preserved even though it is implied through the updated [[Archive]] description that the reason behind the Akademiya's receipt of Rukkhashava Mushrooms no longer exists. In addition, immediately following Nahida's removal of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, Nahida still felt sad even though she only remembered that she had just successfully removed the pollution from Irminsul.<ref name="boat" /> Later, Nahida is also able to tell that she was once supported by a certain "warmth" that is implied to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata or her memory.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dream of Farewell}}</ref> In addition, after [[Scaramouche]] attempted to purge himself from Irminsul, the Traveler personally verifies that the consequences of all that he did still remained, but for different reasons or with different actors.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Dance of Destruction}}</ref>

The removal of information appears to only happen once. Removed information that is preserved or retrieved by those who belong to Teyvat does not disappear again.<ref name="kabukimono finale" />

===Known Removals===
====Greater Lord Rukkhadevata====
{{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|[[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]}} was removed from {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|Irminsul|Irminsul|[[Irminsul]]}} by [[Nahida]] during the {{Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}. Due to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's connection to Irminsul, her existence was polluted by forbidden knowledge and thus continued to pollute Irminsul even after her death.

In addition to successfully removing the pollution from Irminsul, the removal of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had the following consequences:
* The Akademiya's motivation for imprisoning Lesser Lord Kusanali is changed to be purely because of disappointment in her weakness and lack of wisdom following the cataclysm, with nostalgia and devotion towards Greater Lord Rukkhadevata no longer being involved.<ref name="toast" />
** It is unclear to what extent Nahida was believed to have been imprisoned, as references to Nahida's imprisonment in the Sanctuary of Surasthana were also changed, even though Nahida's imprisonment is still known to have happened. The following stories in Nahida's Story interface in the Character Menu are [[Nahida/Lore#Altered Character Stories|altered]] with such changes: Character Story 4 and Nahida's "Toy Box."
* All Sumeru NPC dialogue that specifically mentioned Greater Lord Rukkhadevata change to instead refer to Lesser Lord Kusanali, either by name or as "the Dendro Archon."
* All item descriptions referring to Rukkhadevata change to no longer refer to her. Affected items include:
** Archive description of [[Kalpalata Lotus]]
** Archive and inventory descriptions of [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]]
** Archive description of [[Harra Fruit]]
** Archive description of [["The Boon of the Elder Tree"]]
* Books in both the player's inventory and in the Archive change to no longer refer to her. Affected books include:
** [[The Folio of Foliage]]
* [[Nahida]], Rukkhadevata's next incarnation and one of her greatest admirers, forgets about her senior God. She now believes that she has always been the original Dendro Archon of Sumeru and lost her memories and powers due to combating the darkness during the [[cataclysm]]. The following stories in Nahida's Story interface in the Character Menu are [[Nahida/Lore#Altered Character Stories|altered]] to reflect this: Character Details, Character Story 1, and Character Story 3.
** Character Story 5 and Gnosis are not unlocked until after the removal of Rukkadevata and thus do not undergo updates.
** Character Story 4 and Nahida's "Toy Box" are also updated, but the material that was updated is unrelated to Rukkhadevata, as mentioned earlier.
* The other gods also forget Rukkhadevata. "About Buer" voice-overs become available for [[Venti/Voice-Overs#About Buer|Venti]], [[Zhongli/Voice-Overs#About Buer|Zhongli]], and [[Raiden Shogun/Voice-Overs#About Buer|Ei]] after Rukkhadevata's removal from Irminsul, and they talk of "Buer" as if they had always known her, implying that they believe that Kusanali was always the Dendro Archon. Likewise, Nahida believes that she once knew The Seven personally and that she is only missing those memories due to what supposedly happened during the cataclysm.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Nahida|About The Seven: Introduction}}</ref> She believes she should re-establish contact with The Seven, which indicates she has never met with any of them. This means that in reality, The Seven only met Rukkhadevata and never met Lesser Lord Kusanali.
* Zhongli's Character Story 5 is [[Zhongli/Lore#Altered Character Stories|altered]]. Only the following phrase is altered: "only two remain of the first Seven" to "only two of the first Seven remain in positions of rulership."
* The Traveler's "About Beliefs" voice-over, in which they discuss Rukkhadevata with Paimon, is removed since Paimon no longer remembers Rukkhadevata.<ref group="Note">Removal of the voice-over only happens after completion of the following quest, ''A Toast to Victory'', and thus the entire Act, not after completion of ''Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies''.</ref>
* All instances of "Queen Aranyani" in the voicelines of the [[Aranara]] and the {{Quest|Aranyaka}} were changed to "Dendro Archon" or "Lord of Verdure," implying that they too have forgotten their creator and that in the end, there are things which even the forest cannot remember.

There are two references to Rukkhadevata's name that are shown to persist even after her removal. The first is in the description of [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]]; its [[Archive]] description is changed to clarify that people believe that the name "Rukkhadevata" refers to a giant tree that once existed in Sumeru. The second is in one of the thrones in [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]], whose inscription spells out "RUKDVTA" in [[Deshret Script]]; the location's unique properties may have preserved Rukkhadevata's name from the change in Irminsul.

There are also a few other references to Rukkhadevata in Weapons' and Artifacts' descriptions that do not change with the completion of the quest:<!--, and whether any of these are an oversight or intentional is unknown-->
* The description of the artifact [[Viridescent Venerer's Determination]]
* The description of the weapon [[Fruit of Fulfillment]]
<!--* A [[Bounty/List#Medium 4|Sumeru bounty]] for an [[Eremite Sunfrost]]
* A line spoken by [[Ararycan]] in ''[[Until Vana is Healed]]''
* A line spoken by [[Arapandu]] in ''[[Varuna Gatha (Quest)|Varuna Gatha]]''
-->

====Scaramouche====
{{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|Scaramouche|Scaramouche|[[Scaramouche]]}} attempted to remove himself from {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|Irminsul|Irminsul|[[Irminsul]]}} during the {{Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}. "Scaramouche" and his previous identities as the "kabukimono" and the prototype that Ei allowed to live were successfully removed from Irminsul. However, because no one can completely remove themselves from Irminsul, he himself continued to exist as the [[Wanderer]].

Scaramouche's attempted removal of himself had the following consequences:
* [[Raiden Shogun/Voice-Overs#About Kunikuzushi|Ei]] and [[Yae Miko/Voice-Overs#About Kunikuzushi|Yae Miko]]'s "About Kunikuzushi" voice-overs and [[Tartaglia/Voice-Overs#About The Balladeer|Tartaglia]]'s "About The Balladeer" voice-over are removed.
** [[Nahida/Voice-Overs#About The Balladeer|Nahida]]'s "About The Balladeer" voice-over is not removed, even temporarily.
* [[Mikhail]] and [[Lyudmila]]'s dialogue regarding the recent events in Sumeru is slightly altered to discuss Signora instead of Scaramouche, and Mikhail mentions that the Sixth Harbinger's seat has been vacant for hundreds of years.<ref group="Note">The original Chinese version of Mikhail's dialogue specifies {{zh|几百年|tl=hundreds of years}}.</ref>
* [[Viktor]]'s dialogue about Scaramouche in the {{Quest|Equivalent Exchange}} is changed to instead talk about Tartaglia.
* Viktor's mention of Scaramouche in the {{Quest|Return to Days of Winter}} is removed.
* Tatarasuna's known history from 400 years ago, including the [[Tatarasuna Mystery]], was changed to eliminate the kabukimono's presence as well as the extra tragedies related to him that Dottore brought about due to his interest in the kabukimono. The Traveler personally verifies many of these changes during ''[[A Dance of Destruction]]'' and ''[[The Kabukimono's Finale]]'' immediately following Scaramouche's attempted removal of himself.
** Text regarding a "wandering eccentric" from the ''[[Rather Aged Notes]]'' in Inazuma is removed.
** [[Niwa Hisahide]]'s disappearance as known to others is changed to be due to dying along with another swordsmith from using Escher's device to purge Tatarasuna of its filth, instead of from supposedly fleeing Tatarasuna with his family.
* The fall of most of the [[Raiden Gokaden]], including the [[Case of the Eccentric]], was heavily altered. The Traveler personally verifies many of these changes during ''[[A Dance of Destruction]]'' immediately following Scaramouche's attempted removal of himself.
** The fall of the Futsu, Hyakume, and Senju branches and the near-fall of the Isshin branch of the Raiden Gokaden are changed to be due to the indiscriminate murder spree of a vengeful Hyakume bladesmith who came from a line of embittered descendants of the swordsmith who died with Niwa Hisahide in the revised history, instead of suffering from various seemingly natural misfortunes orchestrated by Scaramouche.<!-- ridiculously long sentence is due to attempting to make all of these bullets have the same structure (X is changed to Y, or X is changed to Y instead of Z)... maybe that wasn't the best idea -->
** [[Kaedehara Yoshinori's Letter]], a quest item from ''[[Hues of the Violet Garden]]'', is changed to describe the encounter with the vengeful Hyakume bladesmith in the revised history instead of the encounter with Scaramouche.
** While not confirmed, it is possible that the Case of the Eccentric is no longer referred to as such, as "eccentric" was used to describe Scaramouche but not the vengeful Hyakume bladesmith.
* Oddly, the description of [[Shakkei Pavilion]] is changed to remove the reference to Scaramouche for all players, regardless of quest progression.
* While he could not eliminate himself from Teyvat and continued to exist as the Wanderer, he did lose his memories of his previous identities since those were successfully removed.
** The Wanderer still knew himself to be a puppet even before his memories were restored. Further details on his and others' perceptions, such as Ei's perception, of the Wanderer's existence as a puppet are unknown.

There are also a few other references to Scaramouche in Weapons' and Artifacts' descriptions that do not change with the completion of the quest:
* The description of the artifact [[Surpassing Cup]]
* The descriptions of all artifacts in the artifact set [[Husk of Opulent Dreams]]
* The description of the weapon [[Kagura's Verity]]
* The description of the weapon [[Kagotsurube Isshin]]

==Notable Parts of Irminsul==
This is a list of parts of Irminsul's roots that players can find in the current version of Teyvat, referred to as "withered trees" by [[Paimon]] due to their appearance. Their wood is silver-white coloured with glowing blue streaks running throughout. The areas where these roots are located also all seem to have strong Ley Line disorders which change the surroundings in various ways, likely connected to the presence of the roots.
*The "[[Frostbearing Tree]]" on the eastern side of [[Sal Vindagnyr]] ([[Dragonspine]])
** For reasons unclear, [[Celestia]] sent the [[Skyfrost Nail]] to destroy the tree long in the past, an event that turned the region's climate into that seen in modern-day Dragonspine. During the cataclysm five hundred years ago, [[Durin]] was slain over the region and his blood revived the tree. As a result, the streaks of the tree have turned red instead of blue.
*The withered tree on a small island further east of  the Frostbearing Tree in  [[Sal Vindagnyr]] ([[Dragonspine]])
* The [[The Chasm Withered Tree|withered tree]] located in the green area in the top right of [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]
* The withered tree besides [["Boatman"]] near Shirikoro Peak, [[Tsurumi Island]]
*The withered tree rooted behind the central island of the [[Eternal Oasis|Orchard of Pairidaeza]] (Eternal Oasis), [[Mt. Damavand]]

=== Other Similar Trees ===
* The large tree which is atop [[Azhdaha]] in [[Nantianmen]] looks similar to the other withered trees due to its blue streaks, but it does not have the signature silver-white bark, and so is not related to Irminsul or the other withered trees.
* The [[Sacred Sakura]] atop [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] is similar in appearance with blue streaks, but also has brown bark like the Azdaha tree. We also see that the Sacred Sakura is planted using its own seed in the [[Story Quest]] ''[[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter|Imperatrix Umbrosa]] Act II: Transient Dreams'', so it cannot be connected to Irminsul.

==Trivia==
* The [[Prototype Crescent]] bowstring is made of Irminsul branches that were retrieved from the [[abyss]].
* In Germanic paganism, an {{w|Irminsul}} is a sacred pillar-like object, typically made of wood.
* Irminsul is shown to have a clear sky above it after being purified.
* The [[Aranara]] refer to Irminsul as "Sarva."{{#tag:ref|The term "return to Sarva" was used as a synonym for "passing away" when talking about [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]],<ref name="Araja">{{Ref/NPC|Araja|note=About "Marana"...}}</ref> implying that "Sarva" was the afterlife. However, Aranara have been mentioned to originate from Sarva,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The World of Aranara}}</ref> return from Sarva,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For the Children of the Past}}</ref> or travel through Sarva.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For All Children Who Long for Life}}</ref> Marana also has been stated to invade Sarva.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For Fruits, Seeds, and Trees}}</ref> After ''[[Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises]]'', Araja said that Sarva no longer remembered Marana,<ref name="Araja"/> which fits the definition of the Irminsul.|group=Note}}
* Truly Ancient Petrified Trees (the same trees found in [[Domain|Domains]], presumed to be connected to Irminsul due to their assocation with Ley Lines & their visual appearance) usually grow to around one or two miles in height and a kind of large spider lives around their roots.<ref name="AlbedoVO">{{Ref/VO|Albedo|Interesting Things}}</ref>
* The Irminsul trees and blossoms in the world are said to intertwine at the deepest, most hidden place in the earth, and the pattern the root system makes defines the Ley Lines of the world.<ref name="OrigResin" />
* The [[Hexenzirkel]] organization conducts Irminsul explorations.<ref name="LisaVO">{{Ref/VO|Lisa|About Mona}}</ref>

===Localization===
* The proper noun "Irminsul" appears only in English texts among the four major supported languages. The Chinese text does not have proper nouns or consistent terms for these ancient silver-white trees. This results in inconsistent localizations among the other languages. See the table below for comparison.
** All instances of "Irminsul" in [[Sumeru]]-related quests were referred to as {{Lang|"{{w|world tree}}"|zh=世界树}} in the East Asian languages.<!-- Note: need confirmation from OTHER regions to say it's a UNIFIED term onwards. -->
** The lore for the catalyst [[Frostbearer]] translates {{Lang|"silver-white tree" in Chinese|zh=银白之树}} literally instead of localizing it as "Irminsul." This may be due to the fact that the tree was not referred to as an {{Lang|"''ancient'' tree"|zh=古树}}.
** All instances of "Irminsul" in the [[Energy Amplifier Initiation]] event were instead expressed as "Ley Line" in the East Asian languages.
