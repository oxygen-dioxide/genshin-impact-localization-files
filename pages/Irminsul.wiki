'''Irminsul''' is Teyvat's world tree, a type of silver-white tree which grows deep underground, and is connected to the [[Ley Lines]] of the world. It is said that the [[Dendro Archon]]'s consciousness is directly connected to it,<ref name="DendArch">YouTube: ''[https://youtu.be/WIxkKExpu94 Version 3.0 "The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings" Trailer]''</ref> and that it itself is the root of [[Dendro]] power.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in Prosperity}}</ref> 

==Overview==
Irminsul is the repository for all of the information and memories of [[Teyvat]],<ref name="toast" /> which are collected via the Ley Lines.<ref name="chronic illness">{{Ref/Quest|Chronic Illness}}</ref> It is unclear exactly how the repository works, as there is no information on the [[Traveler]] in Irminsul by the end of [[Chapter III]]<ref name="toast" /> even though many people in Teyvat know of them. However, the Traveler seems to correctly understand how the repository works.<ref name="toast" />

In Teyvat, Irminsul is connected to Petrified Trees ([[Domains]]), [[Ley Line Outcrops]] and [[Ley Line Blossom]]s, which can be revitalized with [[Original Resin]] or [[Condensed Resin]].<ref name="OrigResin">{{Ref/Item|Original Resin}}</ref><ref name="CondResin">{{Ref/Item|Condensed Resin}}</ref> Irminsul's roots also pierce through the surface in a few select areas of Teyvat.

[[Tighnari]] states that Irminsul grows downwards rather than upwards, from a cavern located deep underground, and that Ley Lines &mdash; described as the roots of Irminsul &mdash; spread and extend from the cavern all the way to the surface.<ref name="chronic illness" /> Judging from this description, any part of Irminsul that reaches the surface is presumably the very ends of the tree's roots. It's possible that Irminsul itself is located either in or near the [[abyss]], given how branches of Irminsul can be found there,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Prototype Crescent|quote="In the end, he chose to use cudrania wood, fine steel and Irminsul branches brought back from the abyss."}}</ref> and branches would typically be found after falling from/breaking from a tree.

The innermost region of Irminsul consists exclusively of torrents of information. Physically navigating it requires great caution, as it is possible to get "lost" among the currents. Additionally, small saplings &mdash; packets of information &mdash; will sometimes spontaneously sprout out of the ground. Touching these can teleport someone to a different location in the space.<ref name="night-bird falls">{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref>

The "heart" of Irminsul is a giant glowing tree at the "center" of the inner region. It appears to sprout out of a cleft in the ground, and its branches visually resemble the connections on a circuit board.

{{See also|Irminsul/Modifications}}
Information is normally added to Irminsul via the Ley Lines, which continually absorb the world's memories.<ref name="chronic illness"/> Those who are not from the world of Teyvat, such as [[Descender]]s, do not have records in Irminsul.<ref name="toast" /><ref name="night-bird falls" /> Individuals who can connect to Irminsul can directly access the information stored in its repository.<ref name="toast" /><ref name="night-bird falls" />

Information can be purged from Irminsul. Doing so removes all traces of that information from Teyvat as it originally existed. The purging of information requires power on the level of a [[god]]. Beings, including gods, can be purged, but a being cannot successfully remove itself entirely from Irminsul.<ref name="boat" /><ref name="kabukimono finale" />

To accommodate the loss of information, anything pertaining to information that belongs to the world of Teyvat may be changed, ranging from people's memories to physical objects such as books and letters. However, the actual events, their overall results, and overarching historical impacts remain unchanged. Those who belong to the world of Teyvat, including the [[Archon]]s, can have their impressions of Teyvat's history altered; they will be unaware of any such changes. Notably, Paimon is also affected.<ref name="toast">{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref><ref name="boat">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref>

Steps can be taken to ensure that lost information is preserved or retrieved, such as abstracting information in a way such that the information "still resonates with the present information recorded in Irminsul."<ref name="kabukimono finale">{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref> The successful preservation and retrieval of information that is purged from Irminsul is presumably difficult to do without the aid of someone who never lost that information, such as the Traveler. To this end, much information could have been purged from Irminsul without anyone remembering (apart from other [[Descender]]s) prior to the Traveler's arrival in Teyvat.

If the information removed is that of an entire being, then the consequences of their actions and existence remain in the world. For example, the rainforests of [[Sumeru]] created by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] remained after she was purged from Irminsul, and the history of the tradition of forest dwellers offering [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]] to [[Sumeru Akademiya]] was preserved even though it is implied through the updated [[Archive]] description that the reason behind the Akademiya's receipt of Rukkhashava Mushrooms no longer exists. In addition, immediately following Nahida's removal of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, Nahida still felt sad even though she only remembered that she had just successfully removed the pollution from Irminsul.<ref name="boat" /> Later, Nahida is also able to tell that she was once supported by a certain "warmth" that is implied to be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata or her memory.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dream of Farewell}}</ref> In addition, after [[Scaramouche]] attempted to purge himself from Irminsul, the Traveler personally verifies that the consequences of all that he did still remained, but are remembered to have happened for different reasons or with different actors.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Dance of Destruction}}</ref>

The removal of information appears to only happen once. Removed information that is preserved or retrieved by those who belong to Teyvat does not disappear again.<ref name="kabukimono finale" />

Unlike [[item]] descriptions, [[Weapon]] and [[Artifact]] descriptions seem to be immune to changes in Irminsul's repository.<ref group="Note">When [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] and [[Scaramouche]] were removed from Irminsul, there were some clearly erroneous persistent references to them that were later fixed to reflect their removals. No such changes have occurred for Weapons or Artifacts. Of particular note is the Artifact Set [[Husk of Opulent Dreams]], the entirety of which details Scaramouche's life such that a hypothetical update to that set would entail a total overhaul of all five artifact descriptions.</ref> Presumably, they exist solely for players.

==Notable Parts of Irminsul==
This is a list of parts of Irminsul's roots that players can find in the current version of Teyvat, referred to as "withered trees" by [[Paimon]] due to their appearance (although they could also be referred to as "'''Petrified Trees'''", "'''Irminsul Trees'''" or "'''Irminsul Roots'''").

Their wood is silver-white colored with glowing blue streaks running throughout. The areas where these roots are located also all seem to have strong Ley Line disorders which change the surroundings in various ways, likely connected to the presence of the roots. Interestingly, the locations of these withered trees are also all in the same locations that [[Celestial Nail]]s are implied to have once landed.

===Withered Trees===
*The "[[Frostbearing Tree]]" on the eastern side of [[Sal Vindagnyr]] ([[Dragonspine]])
** For reasons unclear, [[Celestia]] sent the [[Skyfrost Nail]] to destroy the tree long in the past, an event that turned the region's climate into that seen in modern-day Dragonspine. During the cataclysm five hundred years ago, [[Durin]] was slain over the region and his blood revived the tree. As a result, the streaks of the tree have turned red instead of blue.
*The withered tree on a small island further east of  the Frostbearing Tree in  [[Sal Vindagnyr]] ([[Dragonspine]])
* The [[The Chasm Withered Tree|withered tree]] located in the green area of the map in the top right of [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]
* The withered tree besides [["Boatman"]] near Shirikoro Peak, [[Tsurumi Island]]
*The withered tree rooted behind the central island of the [[Eternal Oasis|Orchard of Pairidaeza]] (Eternal Oasis), [[Mt. Damavand]]

====Other Similar Trees====
* The [[Dragon-Queller]], the large tree atop [[Azhdaha]] in [[Nantianmen]], looks similar to the other withered trees due to its blue streaks, but it does not have the signature silver-white bark, and so is not related to Irminsul or the other withered trees.
* The [[Sacred Sakura]] atop [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] is similar in appearance with blue streaks, but also has brown bark like the Dragon-Queller. We also see that the Sacred Sakura is planted using its own seed in {{Quest|Transient Dreams}}, so it cannot be connected to Irminsul.
* The [[Weeping Willow of the Lake]] in [[Erinnyes Forest]] displays the same blue streaks once purified, but also lacks the silver-white bark of Irminsul trees.

==Trivia==
* The [[Prototype Crescent]] bowstring is made of Irminsul branches that were retrieved from the [[abyss]].
* In Germanic paganism, an {{w|Irminsul}} is a sacred pillar-like object, typically made of wood.
* Irminsul is shown to have a clear sky above it after being purified.
* The [[Aranara]] refer to Irminsul as "Sarva."{{#tag:ref|The term "return to Sarva" was used as a synonym for "passing away" when talking about [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]],<ref name="Araja">{{Ref/NPC|Araja|note=About "Marana"...}}</ref> implying that "Sarva" was the afterlife. However, Aranara have been mentioned to originate from Sarva,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The World of Aranara}}</ref> return from Sarva,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For the Children of the Past}}</ref> or travel through Sarva.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For All Children Who Long for Life}}</ref> Marana also has been stated to invade Sarva.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For Fruits, Seeds, and Trees}}</ref> After ''[[Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises]]'', Araja said that Sarva no longer remembered Marana,<ref name="Araja"/> which fits the definition of the Irminsul.|group=Note}}
* Truly Ancient Petrified Trees (the same trees found in [[Domain]]s, presumed to be connected to Irminsul due to their association with Ley Lines & their visual appearance) usually grow to around one or two miles in height and a kind of large spider lives around their roots.<ref name="AlbedoVO">{{Ref/VO|Albedo|Interesting Things}}</ref>
* The Irminsul trees and blossoms in the world are said to intertwine at the deepest, most hidden place in the earth, and the pattern the root system makes defines the Ley Lines of the world.<ref name="OrigResin" />
* The [[Hexenzirkel]] organization conducts Irminsul explorations.<ref name="LisaVO">{{Ref/VO|Lisa|About Mona}}</ref>
* Irminsul trees can produce a crystalline fruit, as seen in the [[Energy Amplifier Initiation]] event. [[Hosseini]], a Sumerian researcher, is currently studying these fruits.
* It is possible, though difficult, for people to connect their consciousness to Irminsul via meditation. However, many cannot handle the experience and end up going insane.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Silent Seeker of Knowledge}}</ref>

===Localization===
* The proper noun "Irminsul" appears only in English texts among the four major supported languages. The Chinese text does not have proper nouns or consistent terms for these ancient silver-white trees. This results in inconsistent localizations among the other languages. See the table below for comparison.
** All instances of "Irminsul" in [[Sumeru]]-related quests were referred to as {{Lang|"{{w|world tree}}"|zh=世界树}} in the East Asian languages.<!-- Note: need confirmation from OTHER regions to say it's a UNIFIED term onwards. -->
** The lore for the catalyst [[Frostbearer]] translates {{Lang|"silver-white tree" in Chinese|zh=银白之树}} literally instead of localizing it as "Irminsul." This may be due to the fact that the tree was not referred to as an {{Lang|"''ancient'' tree"|zh=古树}}.
** All instances of "Irminsul" in the [[Energy Amplifier Initiation]] event were instead expressed as "Ley Line" in the East Asian languages.
