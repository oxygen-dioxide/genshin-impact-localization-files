{{Description|The Wayob worshipped by the various tribes of Natlan manifest themselves in the form of these obsidian totems.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
'''Wayob Manifestations''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group found in [[Natlan]].

Manifestations of the [[Wayob]]s that inhabit [[Natlan]], these enemies are capable of setting up shields by deploying a field that drains all [[Energy]] from the player's party. The manifestation will generate a generic shield while the field is active. If this first shield is not destroyed before the field expires, the manifestation will proceed to create an elemental shield of its type that requires [[Elemental Reaction]]s in order to remove. If the shield is destroyed before the field expires, a large amount of [[Energy]] will be restored to the entire party.
