|description    = A uniquely shaped dwelling with elegant contours that can be found in [[Merusea Village]]. The stone used here has a unique quality, and it seems to have been processed with techniques that only [[Melusine]]s are familiar with. The result is a smooth finish and vibrant colors that almost make it look like a colorful gem of sorts. However, Melusine senses are quite different from those of ordinary people, and they are used to walking about in such places. As for guests from outside, these stone platforms and floor panels might be so smooth that they in fact pose a bit of a slipping hazard...
