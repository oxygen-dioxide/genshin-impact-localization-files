{{Lang|'''Furuyama'''|ja=古山|ja_rm=Furuyama}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] who appears in {{Quest|Transient Dreams}}.

==Profile==
Furuyama is a human who lived 500 years ago during the time of the [[cataclysm]]. He was a member of the Raiden Shogun's retinue, and was quite close to [[Makoto]], often serving her tea, though sometimes it was actually [[Ei]] he was serving in Makoto's place. At some point, he became blind. He was never told that the Shogun were identical twins, though Ei suspects that he had an inkling that there were two different people and simply never said anything.

When the cataclysm struck [[Inazuma]], Furuyama, having grown to Makoto's teachings, met his end in [[Araumi]] as others fled, since he was content with his life and had no regrets. 500 years afterwards, his memories would roam the [[Sacred Sakura]]'s roots, where he manifested after Ei and the [[Traveler]] were tracking down [[rifthounds]] that were damaging the Sacred Sakura's roots. He was pleased to see the Shogun again and tried to serve them tea, only to notice that his tea set was missing. The Traveler and Ei offered to get him one, doing so from the [[Kamisato Estate]], but by the time they had returned, he had disappeared as the Ley Lines could no longer sustain him. Ei brewed a set of tea and left a cup behind in Furuyama's memory.
