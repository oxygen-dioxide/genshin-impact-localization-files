'''Earth Kitsune Statues''' are statues found in [[Inazuma]]. These can be scanned using the [[Memento Lens]] to reveal hidden mechanisms, objects, or dialogue.

The Earth Kitsune were familiar with the [[Kitsune Saiguu]], and according to legend after the Kitsune Saiguu disappeared, the Earth Kitsune of [[Narukami Island]] turned into sleeping statues to wait for her return.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sacrificial Offering}}</ref>
