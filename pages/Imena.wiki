==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Imena:''' The documents have been very clearly organized. I won't need to do anymore I think.
:{{DIcon}} What sorts of documents?
::'''Imena:''' Ah, it's some communications between the [[Fortress of Meropide]] and the [[Palais Mermonia]]. I'm in charge of sorting them out before handing them over to the Chief Justice.
::'''Imena:''' To be honest, the documents from the Fortress have always been perfect. I just need to go down, come back up, and hand them in.
::'''Imena''' Sometimes I can even get a nice meal at the Coupon Cafeteria over there &mdash; no wonder a retired senior of mine said that you couldn't go wrong with this job.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Imena:''' See you. I hope everything goes well with you too.
