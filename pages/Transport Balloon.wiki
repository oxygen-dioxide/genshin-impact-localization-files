'''Transport Balloons''' are objects that appear as part of [[quest]] challenges. The objective is to escort the balloons safely to a certain destination, while it is being bombarded by [[enemy]] attacks. The balloons will usually carry some cargo. Like the [[Slime Balloon]], it has a certain amount of HP. However, it is not lifted by an Anemo slime, but by an actual hot-air balloon (although the design took inspiration on the Slime Balloon).
