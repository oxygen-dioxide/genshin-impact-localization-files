|description    = A room that is bedecked with various gems, ornaments, and a collection of precious items. Its interior gives off an air of luxury, and lighting but a single lamp in the corner will allow the scattered light to reflect all about, dazzling the senses.<br />For those who seek wealth, such a storeroom is akin to a sweet treat with just the right amount of sugar and a lingering aftertaste. And as for those who appreciate the aesthetics more, they will find the sparkle of the artworks in here a pleasant surprise, no matter the angle from which they look.
