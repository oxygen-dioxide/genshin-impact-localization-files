{{Description|The wisdom of the land has been concentrated within [[Domains]] of late...<br>Use the power of [[Original Resin]] to cause the silver tree to bloom and receive its noble instruction.}}
'''Overflowing Mastery''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 4.8]].

==Event Duration==
* 2024/08/19 04:00:00 – 2024/08/26 03:59:59

==Requirements==
After activating [[Talent Level-Up Material]] [[Domains]] (Domains of Mastery).

==Event Details==
During the event, Travelers who successfully completed the [[Talent Level-Up Materials]] Domains "[[Forsaken Rift]]", "[[Taishan Mansion]]", "[[Violet Court]]", "[[Steeple of Ignorance]]", and  "[[Pale Forgotten Glory]], can claim the rewards by using [[Original Resin]] to receive double the rewards. A total of 3 such bonuses will be available each day.

{{Item|Condensed Resin|30}} cannot be used to claim double rewards. However, claiming the double rewards have the same output as one: doubling everything including {{Item|Companionship EXP|30}} and {{Item|Adventure EXP|30}}.

If the Reunion Blessing bonus from the [[Stellar Reunion]] permanent event is active, then the Reunion Blessing bonus will be consumed first.

Event subtraction rules are as follows: Improved reward instances are first subtracted from the event with the highest Multiplier. If the Multiplier is equal for both events, then double reward instances are first subtracted  from the "Stellar Reunion" event.
