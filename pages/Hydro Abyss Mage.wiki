{{Description|Abyss creatures that utilize Hydro energy in battle.<br />Stories circulate among adventurers that Abyss Mages are at the lowest rung of the Abyss Order's hierarchy and that they roam the various lands to scheme fell deeds of destruction. Though they also often make fun of these Abyss Mages, saying that the most harm they can do is to cause rheumatism or a common cold, their power is not to be underestimated.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
* '''Hydro Shield:''' Upon initiating combat, the Hydro Abyss Mage immediately gains a {{Hydro}} [[Shields|Shield]], protecting it from damage. The shield takes damage from certain [[Elemental Reactions]] and suffers additional damage based on the strength of the attacks it receives. This shield is weakest to {{Cryo}}.
* '''Normal Attack:''' Shoots a water projectile at the target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}
* '''Special Attack - Homing Bubble:''' Releases a homing [[Bubbles|bubble]] that deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} on impact and traps the target inside. These bubbles can also trap other small enemies if they come in contact. The homing bubble itself is very fragile and will pop when coming into contact on anything with a hitbox aside from the player. The player can use [[AoE]] or ranged attacks can help pop it from a distance, or make the bubble run into another enemy or object.
* '''Teleportation:''' If the target is too far from the mage, it clutches its mask and teleports directly in front of the target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}} at its location upon reappearance. The mage can also teleport away from the player to avoid attacks when vulnerable.
* '''Revival:''' If the mage is left alone after its shield is destroyed, summons a large amount of bubbles around it which deal '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} on impact and traps the target inside. During this attack, the mage's [[Interruption Resistance]] is increased. If the mage is not staggered or defeated within 10 seconds, it regains a Hydro Shield, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
* '''Enhancement:''' Certain enhanced Hydro Abyss Mages can be found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges. There are 3 possible types of enhancements: Attack, Shield, and Teleportation.
** '''Attack Enhancement:''' When a '''Homing Bubble''' traps a player, it will deal DMG twice.
** '''Shield Enhancement:''' The '''Hydro Shield''' becomes twice as durable. When a character's attack hits the shield, 1 [[gauge unit]] of Hydro will be applied to the character.
** '''Teleportation Enhancement:''' While teleporting, deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}} at its location upon disappearance.

==Strategy==
* {{Cryo}} attacks are the most effective at destroying the Hydro shield by triggering the [[Frozen]] reaction. Furthermore, the Mage is rendered immobile.
* {{Pyro}} attacks cause [[Vaporize]], dealing moderate damage to its shield.
* {{Electro}} attacks can deal continuous but low damage to its shield by causing the [[Electro-Charged]] reaction.
* A [[Melt]] reaction triggered by applying {{Pyro}} to a Frozen Hydro Abyss Mage will not damage its shield.
