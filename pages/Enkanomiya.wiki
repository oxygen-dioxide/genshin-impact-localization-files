==Quests==
{{Quests by Category List|Enkanomiya Quests|heo=1}}

===Exploration===
* [[Altar Pattern]]s: these patterns consist of the five unique Key Sigil types in a circle along with a number associated with each type. This pattern is entered into [[The Altar at The Serpent's Heart]] to achieve an objective.
* Key Sigil Seals: mechanisms that will appear during Evernight that can be unlocked by using [[Key Sigil]]s in order to unlock a chest or to advance a [[World Quests|World Quest]].
* [[Daises of Day and Night]]: mechanisms that appear different in Whitenight and Evernight. Get close to them to operate them. However, their states will reset when switching between Evernight and Whitenight.
* [[Dainichi Mikoshi/Mechanism|Of Sun and Moon]]: The Dainichi Mikoshi is a beam of light in the center of Enkanomiya that can be turned on and off, effectively changing the state of Enkanomiya between '''Whitenight''' and '''Evernight'''. This can be done by activating the appropriate mechanisms throughout Enkanomiya. Walls and mechanisms hidden during Whitenight are visible during Evernight, and vice versa.

{{See also|Timeline}}
Long ago, the [[Heavenly Principles]] and its [[Four Shades]] defeated the [[Seven Sovereigns]] and began the creation of heaven and earth for humanity's sake.<ref name="TBC2">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2}}</ref> A single, unified human civilization spanned the whole world, which the people of Enkanomiya were part of.<ref name="TSTDS">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref> But later, an individual known as the [[Second Who Came]] appeared and a war broke out between the Heavenly Principles and the Second Who Came which destroyed the heavens and earth. As a result of this disaster, Enkanomiya fell into the ocean and was severed from the surface world.<ref name="TBC2" />

;Years of Darkness
When they fell into the ocean, they met against the [[Dragonheirs of the Depths]] (now known as Bathysmal Vishaps) that ruled this place. They learned that the Dragonheirs loved the dark and shunned the light,<ref name="TBC1">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|1}}</ref> so they used thousands of lanterns to ward them off.<ref name="TBC1" /> However, this was not particularly effective, and so they prayed and lamented, but the [[Heavenly Principles]] and its Four Shades did not hear their pleas. Only on the ''Third Year of Darkness'' did [[Istaroth]], one of the four shining Shades and the "Ruler of Time," hear their lamentations, helping them by giving enough wisdom to [[Aberaku no Mikoto]] so that he could create the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], which was then known as the "Helios." As a result, in the ''Year of Blindness'', Aberaku's wisdom had been awakened, and the people began constructing the Helios under his command.

;Years of Sun and Moon
The year the Helios was completed was the ''First Year of Sun and Moon''. With the light of the Dainichi Mikoshi, they were able to survive and drive away the Dragonheirs.<ref name="TBC2" /> Some great Watatsumi houses such as the [[Yuna Clan]] can be traced back to those days.<ref name="Life of Mouun">{{Ref/Book|The Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden}}</ref> In the ''Second Year of Sun and Moon'', the people of Byakuyakoku sought for a way to return to the surface, thinking that war had surely ended by then, but they were blocked by unknown means. They interpreted this as a ban from the Four Shades, and assumed it meant the Second Who Came was defeated. Around this time, a cabal of corrupt nobles<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lotus Eater}}</ref> manipulated the people of Byakuyakoku into worshipping the Dainichi Mikoshi as a god, while installing a puppet ruler, known as the [[Sunchild]]. Aberaku realized the truth and opposed the corrupt nobles, so the cabal simply convinced the Sunchild that Aberaku wanted to kill him and take his place, then had him accuse Aberaku of high treason and imprisoned him under permanent house arrest. On the ''Tenth Year of Sun and Moon'', Aberaku had died, and his clothes and body were enshrined in various places in acknowledgement of his achievements for creating the Helios.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Hyperion's Dirge (Quest)}}</ref> Others such as [[Spartacus]] also attempted to oppose the rule of the Sunchildren, but failed and were imprisoned. The ''Years of Sun and Moon'' continued under the rule of the Sunchildren, until the arrival of Orobashi.<ref name="TBC2" />

At some point, the people of Enkanomiya built the ''Towers of the Three Realms'' at the borders of Byakuyakoku.<ref name="TBC3">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|3}}</ref> Because Byakuyakoku was on the border between three different realms — the [[Human Realm]], the [[Light Realm]], and the [[Void Realm]], they built these towers to stabilize the tendencies of Byakuyakoku and maintain harmony between the three realms. Because of the importance of these towers, they are hidden using secret arts, and can only be summoned by shrine maidens such as [[Eboshi]] and the Vassals of Watatsumi.<ref name="TBC3" /> The ancient names of these towers have been long forgotten, but the islands on which they stand are now called [[Yachimatahiko's Locus]], [[Yachimatahime's Locus]], and [[Kunado's Locus]].

During this time, the people of Enkanomiya observed some special phenomena &mdash; the [[Sunfire Phantasms|mirages]] and the [[Sinshades]] &mdash; which they indiscriminately referred to as "Eidolons." It was not until the arrival of Orobashi that they were able to understand them, and they respectively named them [[Sunfire Phantasms]] and [[Ghostfire Phantasms]].<ref name="TBC5">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|5}}</ref>

;Arrival of Orobashi
After being defeated in the Archon War and fleeing the continent of [[Teyvat]],<ref>{{Ref/Book|A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief}}</ref> the ancient god later known as [[Orobashi|Orobashi no Mikoto]] appeared in Byakuyakoku.<ref name="JBoaDS" /> A young child of Enkanomiya found Orobashi in a cave and asked it to become their god. Taking pity on them, Orobashi overthrew the Sunchildren and defeated the Dragonheirs, sealing them away. Orobashi then used the corals growing off its body to create a path back to the surface world, creating [[Watatsumi Island]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Sangonomiya Chronicles}}</ref> The people it saved dubbed this new land "Sangonomiya" and in turn began referring to Byakuyakoku as "Enkanomiya." They also began worshipping this god as their "Orobashi no Mikoto" and "Watatsumi Omikami."<ref name="TMBD1" />

Upon taking in the Enkanomiyan people, Orobashi came upon the book [[Before Sun and Moon]], which recorded a history of the world that [[Celestia]] wanted concealed. He learnt of a prophecy that foretells the rebirth of the [[Dragon of Water]], one of the Seven Sovereigns, in [[Neuvillette|human form]]. Orobashi placed a ban upon the book and began personally leading experiments on the Dragonheirs to better understand their abilities, as well as prevent the return of the Dragon of Water.<ref name="TBC4">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4}}</ref>

On the last day of Enkanomiya before the people relocated above the sea, envoys from [[Khaenri'ah]] alongside a [[Ruin Guard]] came to seize the book ([[Before Sun and Moon]]). [[Antei|Antigonus]] fought them and prevented the loss of the book, but was also critically injured as a result.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Antigonus}}</ref>

;Present Time
Every few thousand years, Enkanomiya begins to bleach the soil of Watatsumi Island, which would endanger the island, slowly turning it into desert, as well as release the Dragonheir of the Depths and other monsters to the surface if not dealt with properly. In order to stop this from happening, the people of Watatsumi must conduct a ritual known as the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]], which involves using a Jade Coral Branch broken off from the depths of Enkanomiya.

Recently, [[Tsuyuko]] requested the [[Traveler]] to remove the five seals to obtain the [[Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep]]. To deal with the issue, she sent a request to [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] to authorize entry into Enkanomiya, who eventually granted them permission to enter and retrieve the [[Bloodbranch Coral]] for the ritual. During the Traveler's trip into Enkanomiya, they discovered the ancient Bathysmal Vishaps, along with numerous [[hilichurls]] and traces of the [[Abyss Order]], who were ordered by "[[Enjou]]" to search for the book "[[Before Sun and Moon]]". This was done in order to prove that the gods and [[Celestia]] came from outside Teyvat.

Sometime after handing the Bloodbranch Coral over, the Traveler learns from Kokomi that the ritual underwent some complications. Upon investigating, they find an everlasting darkness surrounding Enkanomiya, and a strange shrine maiden named [[Tsumi]] who initially helps the Traveler. The Traveler finds out that Enjou was causing the darkness, and was maliciously conspiring with Tsumi, who may be one of the ''"Vishap-people"'': vishaps that evolved to imitate humans to infiltrate human society. The Traveler repels the darkness and convinces Tsumi not to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi, although Tsumi warns that the vishaps will be back. Returning to Sangonomiya Shrine, Kokomi denies the existence of Vishap-people, saying that Tsumi is likely the last Vassal of Watatsumi, human/snake hybrid familiars of Orobashi. Now that she knows how the Bloodbranch Coral works, Kokomi decides to find a different method of stopping the soil bleaching, in order to no longer disturb the vishaps.<ref name="TRGO Aftermath" />

==Culture==
The Enkanomiyans revered snakes, even before [[Orobashi]] became their patron. In fact, [[The Serpent's Heart]] was originally called ''Delphi'', or "land of snakes." Since the "earliest times," they had worshipped ''Ouroboros'', also referred to as the "great imaginary serpent" or "Cosmic Serpent." After the arrival of Orobashi, the Enkanomiyans came to worship them both, depicting Ouroboros as a "scaleless serpent" and Orobashi as a "coral-adorned serpent."<ref name="TBC3" />

According to [[Enjou]], the Enkanomiyans also had a tradition of "triangle worship." They believed that Enkanomiya was the intersection of three realms, the [[Vishap Realm]], [[Void Realm]], and [[Realm|Human Realm]]. Their borders are marked out by three corners, at which they established three watchposts (now trial sites) to guard against the [[Vishap]]s.<ref name="TSTDS" /> Triangle motifs are also prominent in the architecture of Enkanomiya, such as in the Dainichi Mikoshi, which is made of three tall pillars that form a triangle-shaped interior, and in [[Triangular Mechanism]]s.

As they integrated with the nation of Inazuma above, many Enkanomiyan things gained Inazuman names, such as the artificial sun, ''Helios'' ("Dainichi Mikoshi"), and the people of Enkanomiya themselves (e.g., ''Abrax'' as "Aberaku no Mikoto"). Over time, the ancient Enkanomiyan language became lost.

The Watatsumi people have continued the practice of certain Enkonomiyan traditions, such as fortune-telling using "Deep Sea Spiritherbs," a type of plant transplanted to Watatsumi Island from Enkanomiya.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Divine Plant of the Depths}}</ref>

==Descriptions==

{{Description|Ancient legends tell of a towering palace as resplendent as daylight, plunged into the eternal night amidst the sky-shattering flames of war.

However, the hands of time bury all things indiscriminately — ambition and desire, joy and sorrow — they now slumber eternal beneath the waves, wrapped in the sweet blanket of oblivion.|[[Map]] marker description}}

==Trivia==
* Enkanomiya may be based on the lost city of {{W|Atlantis}} or the lost continent of {{W|Mu (mythical lost continent)|Mu}}, which has also been identified with Atlantis. In lore pertaining to both locations, they are described as technologically advanced civilizations which sank underwater in a single night after experiencing severe earthquakes.
* Based on the architecture and names of the people here, Enkanomiya may be inspired by Greece. This makes Atlantis as an inspiration more likely as it is a Greek legend specifically written about by Plato.

===Etymology===
* {{Lang|''Tokoyokoku''|ja=常世国|ja_rm=Tokoyokoku}} translates to "eternal land" or "distant land."
* A {{Lang|{{w|midnight sun}} or white night|ja=白夜|ja_rm=byakuya}}, used in the location's original name Byakuyakoku, refers to a natural phenomenon in which the sun remains visible during nighttime.
** This implies that the area was named Byakuyakoku after the creation of the Dainichi Mikoshi. ''[[The Byakuyakoku Collection#Vol. 3|The Byakuyakoku Collection, Vol. 3]]'' also states that its name has been changed from "Aphotic Earth" to "Tokoyokoku" to "Byakuyakoku" over the years, which supports this theory.
