==Features==
===Quests===
{{Quests by Category List|Enkanomiya Quests}}

===Exploration===
* [[Altar Pattern]]s: these patterns consist of the five unique Key Sigil types in a circle along with a number associated with each type. This pattern is entered into [[The Altar at The Serpent's Heart]] to achieve an objective.
* Key Sigil Seals: mechanisms that will appear during Evernight that can be unlocked by using [[Key Sigil]]s in order to unlock a chest or to advance a [[World Quests|World Quest]].
* [[Daises of Day and Night]]: mechanisms that appear different in Whitenight and Evernight. Get close to them to operate them. However, their states will reset when switching between Evernight and Whitenight.
* [[Dainichi Mikoshi/Mechanism|Of Sun and Moon]]: The Dainichi Mikoshi is a beam of light in the center of Enkanomiya that can be turned on and off, effectively changing the state of Enkanomiya between '''Whitenight''' and '''Evernight'''. This can be done by activating the appropriate mechanisms throughout Enkanomiya. Walls and mechanisms hidden during Whitenight are visible during Evernight, and vice versa.
* [[Ghostfish]]: schools of fish in the air found in Enkanomiya. They allow the player to continuously glide while in the group. They are notably found around [[The Emanant Skylight]]s.
* [[Phase Gate]]: a mechanism that transports the player to a different location.
* [[Places of Essence Worship]]: these mechanisms contain the power of Whitenight and Evernight. They allow the player to utilize a mechanism that can only be used in Whitenight while in Evernight, and vice-versa.
* [[Shield-Light of Tokoyo|Shield-Lights of Tokoyo]]: barriers in Enkanomiya that are present during Whitenight are dispelled during Evernight.
* [[Smashed Stone]]: stone-like crates that contain Mora.
* [[Sunfire Phantasm]]s: distortions visible in in the air in Enkanomiya. Switching between Whitenight and Evernight can cause these illusions to disperse or show themselves. These typically obscure other mechanisms, such as Altar Patterns.
* [[Triangular Mechanism]]s: attacks can be used to activate them. If damaged, switch to Evernight to fix them.

==Lore==
{{See also|Timeline}}
Long ago, the [[Primordial One]] and its Shining Shades defeated the [[Seven Sovereigns]] and began the creation of heaven and earth for humanity's sake.<ref name="TBC2">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2}}</ref> A single, unified human civilization spanned the whole world, which the people of Enkanomiya were part of.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref> But later, an individual known as the [[Second Who Came]] appeared and a war broke out between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came which destroyed the heavens and earth. As a result of this disaster, Enkanomiya fell into the ocean and was severed from the surface world.<ref name="TBC2" />

;Years of Darkness
When they fell into the ocean, they met against the [[Dragonheir of the Depths]] (now known as [[Bathysmal Vishaps]]) that ruled this place. They learned that the Dragonheirs loved the dark and shunned the light,<ref name="TBC1">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|1}}</ref> so they used thousands of lanterns to ward them off.<ref name="TBC1" /> However, this was not particularly effective so they prayed and lamented but the [[Primordial One]] and its Shining Shades did not hear their pleas. Only on ''Third Year of Darkness'' did [[Istaroth]], one of the four Shining Shades and the "Ruler of Time", hear their lamentations and she helped them by giving enough wisdom to [[Aberaku|Aberaku no Mikoto]] so that he could create the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], which was then known as the "Helios". As result, in the ''Year of Blindness'', Aberaku's wisdom had been awakened and the people began constructing the Helios under his command.

;Years of Sun and Moon
The year the Helios was completed was the ''First Year of Sun and Moon''. With the light of the Dainichi Mikoshi, they were able to drive away the Dragonheirs and survive.<ref name="TBC2" /> Some great Watatsumi houses such as the [[Yuna Clan]] trace back to those days.<ref name="Life of Mouun">{{Ref/Book|The Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden}}</ref> In the ''Second Year of Sun and Moon'', the people of Byakuyakoku sought for a way back to the surface, thinking the war has surely ended by now, but they were blocked by unknown means. They interpreted this as a ban from the Primordial One and assumed this meant the Second Who Came was defeated. Around this time, a cabal of corrupt nobles<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lotus Eater}}</ref> manipulated the people of Byakuyakoku into worshipping the Dainichi Mikoshi as a god and installed a puppet ruler, known as the [[Sunchild]]. Aberaku opposed the corrupt nobles, so the Sunchild accused him of high treason and imprisoned him. On the ''Tenth Year of Sun and Moon'', Aberaku had died and his clothes and body were enshrined in various places in acknowledgement of his achievements for creating the Helios.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Hyperion's Dirge}}</ref> Others, such as [[Supada no Hiko|Spartacus]], also attempted to oppose the rule of the Sunchildren but failed and were imprisoned. The ''Years of Sun and Moon'' continued under the rule of the Sunchildren until the arrival of Orobashi.<ref name="TBC2" />

At some point, the people of Enkanomiya built the ''Towers of the Three Realms'' at the borders of Byakuyakoku.<ref name="TBC3">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|3}}</ref> Because Byakuyakoku was on the border between three different realms, the [[Human Realm]], the [[Light Realm]], and the [[Void Realm]], they built these towers to stabilize the tendencies of Byakuyakoku and maintain harmony between the three realms. Since these towers are so important, they are hidden using secret arts and can only be summoned by shrine maidens, such as [[Eboshi]], and the Vassals of Watatsumi.<ref name="TBC3" /> The ancient names of these towers have been long forgotten, but islands they are located on are now called [[Yachimatahiko's Locus]], [[Yachimatahime's Locus]], and [[Kunado's Locus]].

During this time, the people of Enkanomiya observed some special phenomena &mdash; the [[Sunfire Phantasms|mirages]] and the [[Sinshades]] &mdash; which they indiscriminately referred to as "Eidolons." It was not until the arrival of Orobashi that they were able to understand them and they respectively named them [[Sunfire Phantasms]] and [[Ghostfire Phantasms]].<ref name="TBC5">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|5}}</ref>

;Arrival of Orobashi
After being defeated in the Archon War and fleeing the continent of [[Teyvat]],<ref>{{Ref/Book|A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief}}</ref> the ancient god later known as [[Orobashi|Orobashi no Mikoto]] appeared in Byakuyakoku.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Jade Branch of a Distant Sea}}</ref> A young child of Enkanomiya found the god in a cave and asked Orobashi to become their god. Taking pity on them, Orobashi overthrew the Sunchildren and defeated the Dragonheirs and sealed them away. Orobashi then used the corals growing off its body to create a path back to the surface world and create [[Watatsumi Island]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Sangonomiya Chronicles}}</ref> The people it saved dubbed this new land "Sangonomiya" and in turn began referring to Byakuyakoku as "Enkanomiya". They also began worshipping this god as their "Orobashi no Mikoto" and "Watatsumi Omikami".<ref name="TMBD1" />

In taking in the Enkanomiya people, Orobashi came upon the book [[Before Sun and Moon]], which recorded a history of the world that [[Celestia]] wanted concealed, and he learned of a prophecy that foretells the rebirth of the [[Dragon of Water]], one of the Seven Sovereigns, in human form. Orobashi placed a ban upon the book and began personally leading experiments on the Dragonheirs to better understand their abilities as well as prevent the return of the Dragon of Water.<ref name="TBC4">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4}}</ref>

On the last day of Enkanomiya before the people relocated above the sea, envoys from [[Khaenri'ah]] along with a [[Ruin Guard]] came and stole the book [[Before Sun and Moon]]. [[Antei|Antigonus]] fought them and prevented the loss of the book, but was also critically injured.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Antigonus}}</ref>

;Present Time
Every few thousand of years, Enkanomiya begins to bleach Watatsumi Island's soil, which would endanger the island and slowly turn it into desert if not dealt with accordingly, along with the Dragonheir of the Depths or some other monster that may have resided inside and waiting to escape to the surface. In order to stop this from happening, the people of Watatsumi must conduct a ritual known as the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]], which involves using a Jade Coral Branch broke off from the depths of Enkanomiya.

Recently, [[Tsuyuko]] requested the [[Traveler]] to remove the five seals to obtain the [[Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep]] while sending a request to [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] to authorize entry into Enkanomiya to deal with the problem, who eventually gave them permission to enter and retrieve the [[Bloodbranch Coral]] to be used in the ritual. During the Traveler's trip into Enkanomiya, they discovered the ancient Bathysmal Vishaps along with numerous [[hilichurls]] and traces of the [[Abyss Order]], having been sent by "[[Enjou]]" to search for the book "[[Before Sun and Moon]]" hidden inside to prove that the gods and [[Celestia]] came from outside Teyvat.

Sometime after handing the Bloodbranch Coral over, the Traveler learns from Kokomi that the ritual had a complication. Upon investigating, they find an everlasting darkness surrounding Enkanomiya and a strange shrine maiden named [[Tsumi]] who initially helps the Traveler. The Traveler finds out that Enjou was causing the darkness and was working together with the Tsumi, who may be one of the ''"Vishap-people"'', which are vishaps that evolved to imitate humans so they can infiltrate human society. The Traveler repels the darkness and convinces Tsumi not to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi, although Tsumi says the vishaps will still be back. Returning to Sangonomiya Shrine, Kokomi denies the existence of Vishap-people and says Tsumi is likely the last Vassal of Watatsumi, human/snake hybrid familiars of Orobashi. Now that she knows how the Bloodbranch Coral works, Kokomi decides to find a different method of stopping the soil bleaching as to no longer disturb the vishaps.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath}}</ref>

==Culture==
The Watatsumi people have continued practicing the traditions of Enkanomiya. One such tradition is fortune-telling using "Deep Sea Spiritherbs", a type of plant transplanted on Watatsumi Island from Enkanomiya.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Divine Plant of the Depths}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*A {{Lang|{{w|midnight sun}} or white night|ja=白夜|ja_rm=byakuya}}, used in the location's original name Byakuyakoku, refers to a natural phenomenon in which the sun remains visible during nighttime.
**This implies that the area was named Byakuyakoku after the creation of the Dainichi Mikoshi.
*Enkanomiya may be based on the lost city of {{W|Atlantis}}.
*Based on the architecture and names of the people here, Enkanomiya may be inspired by Greece.
