==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon reaching the designated location)
:{{A|vo kylq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, (Traveler)! She's in trouble!

;(After defeating opponents)
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 01.ogg}} '''Vile:''' Why is this happening to me? I shouldn't have helped {{Color|buzzword|him}}...
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Him, who?
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 02.ogg}} '''Vile:''' Thanks so much for saving me! You're far more reliable than those Favonius guys.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 02b.ogg}}  '''Paimon:''' It's nothing. (He/She)'s a traveler, (he/she) has to deal with stuff like this all the time.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 03.ogg}} '''Vile:''' Traveler? I've heard stories about you. I didn't think I'd be saved by {{Color|buzzword|the one I'm here to meet}}.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you're the...
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 04.ogg}} '''Vile:''' Hahaha... I didn't know how I could pay you back initially, but now, I think I'll just give you the intel for free.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 05.ogg}} '''Vile:''' People in our circle know how important the network is.
:{{DIcon}} Really?
::{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 06.ogg}} '''Vile:''' Well, you did save my life.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, friend.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' LUCKY!
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... it's lucky for Kaeya, isn't it? He's supposed to pay for the intel...
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 07.ogg}} '''Vile:''' Listen well then, the intel on the Arcadian Ruins...
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 08.ogg}} '''Vile:''' "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure."
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right... Wait, is that it?
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 09.ogg}}  '''Vile:''' There's also this map that came with it.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could... this be the X-marks-the-spot?
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the clue is more like a riddle...
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, should be a piece of cake for ya, right (Traveler)? Paimon'll leave it to you then!
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing.
:{{DIcon}} Sure... I hope.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if you can't solve it, we can ask Kaeya. He seems like a nerd too.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 vile 10.ogg}} '''Vile:''' I'll leave you the intel so you can review it at any time.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, Vile.
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure."
:{{A|vo kylq002 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What does that mean? If you don't wanna ask Kaeya, you better figure it out!

;(Talk to Vile again)
:{{A|vo dialog kylq002 vile 01.ogg}} '''Vile:''' "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure." Got it?

----

;(If asking Kaeya for a clue)
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Traveler! You're back! Looks like you got the intel.
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes and no. It's a lot more complicated than that.
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure." What do you make of it?
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Riddles? How quaint. Let me think...
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' "City in the lake" is clearly Mondstadt... As for the Six-Armed Giants... Hm...
:{{DIcon}} Crabs?
::{{A|vo kylq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Giant crabs!
::{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Aside from asking just where we would find giant crabs...
::{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Crabs have eight legs, not six...
::{{DIcon}} The windmills, then?
:{{DIcon}} Should be... the windmills?
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hey! That's smart!
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' A windmill has six blades... It fits.
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! That makes sense!
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So, out of the three windmills, two are close to the statue...
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The other one is guarding...
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Ooh! This one Paimon knows! The treasure!
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hehehe... Let's hope it's really that simple.
:{{A|vo kylq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, (Traveler)! Let's go take a look around that windmill!

;(Talk to Kaeya again)
:{{A|vo dialog kylq002 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' If I'm right, the location described by the clue is the windmill the furthest away from the statue... I'm not completely certain though.

----

;(Interact with the Common Chest at the windmill)
:{{A|vo kylq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, lemme see what's inside!
:{{A|vo kylq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "She doesn't love him at all. The passion rushing through the clear spring is just a front. When she's cold and alone, her true heart is revealed."
:{{A|vo kylq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's another map.
:{{A|vo kylq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' More riddles?
:{{A|vo kylq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's dizzy already. Oh, no! Paimon used up all her brain juice!
:{{DIcon}} You never had any to begin with...
:{{A|vo kylq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon'll let you have all the fun. Or, you could get Kaeya to help.

----

;(If asking Kaeya for a clue)
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' "She doesn't love him at all. The passion rushing through the clear spring is just a front. When she's cold and alone, her true heart is revealed."
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Any idea what that means?
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Is this some page stripped from a love novel that you just happened to find?
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so it's not a clue. No wonder someone as clever as Paimon wasn't able to get it.
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hahaha... I'm just joking.
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph... Take this more seriously, Kaeya!
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, this riddle is hard to figure out. Clear spring... Is it referring to Springvale?
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' "Passion rushing through the clear spring..." So when does passion rush through a clear spring?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe when there are people bathing in the spring water?
::{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Such inappropriate behavior... I feel like it has been creeping into Mondstadt for quite a while now.
::{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Unless... that's something you two get up to?
::{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh, my apologies. I shouldn't judge what one does in their own time.
::{{A|vo kylq002 7 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's wrong with you? What kind of people do you think we are?
::{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha. The thing is, if the "rushing passion" isn't coming from the clear spring, then it's coming from the people bathing.
::{{DIcon}} Hmm... Maybe it's when the water level of the clear spring changes?
:{{DIcon}} When the water level changes?
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Not a bad idea! Like when... there's a waterfall, for example...
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 11.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' It appears the solution to this enigma related to the waterfall behind Springvale.
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 12.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Only the clear spring that blesses Mondstadt can reveal the passion described here.
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 13.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' And the "heart" of the waterfall must refer to the cliff on the left side of the waterfall. I noticed it once when I was out on patrol in the area.
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 14.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The ending, "cold and alone," probably has something to do with Cryo, which can be controlled by a Vision.
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 15.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You should probably take someone who can manipulate Cryo with you.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the help, Kaeya.
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 16.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' It's nothing. If a Knight of Favonius couldn't even answer a riddle, how could we be trusted to solve criminal mysteries?
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go take a look in Springvale. We'll leave you to your "criminal mysteries!"
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 kaeya 17.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Erm...
:{{A|vo kylq002 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, wait... Leave you to SOLVING your criminal mysteries!

;(Talk to Kaeya again)
:{{A|vo dialog kylq002 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Take a look around the waterfall near Springvale. Remember to bring a friend who can manipulate Cryo. Huh? Oh... Me?

----

;(After activating the Cryo Monuments at Springvale)
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This time, the mysteries have all been solved, it sure took a lot of work.
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But in all fairness, this treasure map really is terrible... It looks like it was drawn by a pirate...
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So now...
:{{DIcon}} Let's report to Kaeya first.
::{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Paimon believes that there is no need!
:{{DIcon}} Let's go to the treasure location directly!
::{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You read my mind! Paimon's so happy!
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go for it! Don't want anyone else to get there before we do!
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like... like the Treasure Hoarders Kaeya told us about.
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyways, Paimon just wants to borrow the sword to...
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, you heard nothing! Paimon ah– Paimon just wants to see it!
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Definitely not to become super, mega, powerful and do nothing but play...
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Alright, Paimon'll save the chit-chat for later.
:{{A|vo kylq003 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Arcadian treasure hunt, here we go!
