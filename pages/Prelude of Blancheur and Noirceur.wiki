==Summary==
;Soloist's Prologue

Arriving at [[Caravan Ribat]], [[Paimon]] reminiscences about the first time they arrived, helping free [[Nahida]] from the corrupt sages of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]]. As they prepare to go off to [[Fontaine]], [[Dehya]] arrives and greets them, who had just finished a commission to transport some goods. She asks them what they were planning to do, and when the Traveler mentions going to Fontaine, a Fontainan looks at them with suspicion. Dehya expresses dismay that the pair will be leaving but remembers that they were traveling, so she offers to have some mercenaries escort them to the border between the two nations, though they kindly decline. Dehya admits that she finds it hard that the real heroes would leave quietly, but wishes them luck on their journey. After finishing up their own business in Sumeru, the Traveler and Paimon walk up to the edge of a desert cliff to see [[Romaritime Harbor]] in the distance.

Once they arrive at the port, Paimon is amazed by the advanced technology and the two briefly talk about what to do in the nation. The Traveler suggests they meet the Hydro Archon right away, with Paimon wondering what her personality would be like after Nahida mentioned that she had a "unique personality". Seeing two locals nearby, Paimon suggests talking to them to get information about the Hydro Archon. [[Rena]] and [[Etienne]] talk about the recent trial at the [[Court of Fontaine]], the former explaining that it is similar to an opera house. When Paimon worries about the trials not being taken seriously, Rena tells them that with [[Neuvillette]] and the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] created by the Archon, false charges and injustice were a thing of the past. Paimon then asks them where they could meet the Hydro Archon, and Etienne tells her that their archon, Lady [[Furina]], basically lives there. Rena correctly deduces that they want to talk with her and tells them that the process is much more complicated, as she's wildly popular by the people and anyone wanting to see her would have to make an appointment in advance.

The Traveler deduces that while the people of Fontaine like their Archon, they do not revere her. As Paimon suggests they spend the time exploring the city, the Traveler spots a girl by the edge of the port and decides to check on her. The girl remarks about a memory in the past, but the area it is associated with is now submerged and she mysteriously states that they will be, too. Before they could go on, her brother appears, thanking them for taking care of [[Lynette]]. He then introduces himself as [[Lyney]] and Paimon explains that Lynette was talking to them. This surprises Lyney, who explains that she usually keeps to herself. Paimon asks about Lynette's mysterious statements, so Lyney explains that there is a prophecy going around in Fontaine. He then formally greets the pair, shaking hands with the Traveler and patting Paimon on the back. Learning the reason for their visit, Lyney offers to take them to the opera house.

As they make their way around, they are instead greeted by Furina and her entourage, surprising Paimon. Furina directly addresses the Traveler and Paimon, aware of the disruption they caused in other nations but nonetheless welcomes them as the nation's Archon. She then asks them if they have the qualities to communicate with her as the person from before bows, having informed her of their arrival. The people believe that the Traveler had come to duel her, so the Traveler draws their sword. [[Clorinde]] prepares to intercept, but Furina has her stand down, commending on their bravery to stand against a god. As a normal duel would be too predictable, Furina instead declares that they will have a 'duel' in court, surprising the Traveler and Paimon as they had only just arrived in the nation. Furina then points out that they had just broken a law by releasing a flying object on the first three days of a month - referring to Paimon, thus giving legal grounds to arrest them.

Lyney objects to the order on the grounds that Paimon is something else. Furina hears his claim, so Lyney snaps his fingers, revealing a red cord of energy tying the Traveler's hand to Paimon's back. He claims that this makes Paimon a balloon. Furthermore, the pair had arrived in the nation like this, making the charges unwarranted. Furina is entertained and drops the charges. She then leaves, expecting a good performance from Lyney and Lynette later on. Paimon is left baffled by the encounter, while Lyney explains that he had remembered such a law and made preparations just in case. He then reveals that he and his sister are having their first performance in the court, which serves as an opera house when a trial is not in session.

Lyney gives them a Magic Pocket and tells them more about the prophecy; everyone is born with sin, and not even the Hydro Archon could absolve them. One day, the water levels would rise in Fontaine, drowning the people and leaving the Hydro Archon alone, weeping on her throne; so that the sins of the nation could be washed away. Paimon asks to why the people are born into sin, but Lyney is not able to give a clear answer. Regardless, the people believed the claims to be baseless until recently when the nation's water levels began to rise. Thus, the Magic Pockets will allow people in the waterside to transport their belongings as they relocate.

After giving the Magic Pockets to nearby people, the two return to Lyney, who wanted to have the people prepared in the worst-case scenario. Before they could leave, he asks them to help gather some [[Romaritime Flower]]s. Once they do so, they spot a girl pickpocketing the people and concoct a plan to catch her. The twins move in as the Traveler cuts off the thief's escape route. Some time passes and the Traveler decides to check on Lyney, who had returned the stolen items. The thief fled, but Lyney hurt himself, forcing them to abort the pursuit. With everything finally resolved, they take the aquabus. Just as its about to pull out, [[Charlotte]] rushes on.

Charlotte is surprised to see the Traveler and Paimon, not having heard anything about their visit to the nation. She introduces herself to Lyney and Lynette before discussing recent events, mostly a case with young women disappearing over the past 20 years with no resolution in sight. Once they arrive, Charlotte leaves for an interview. Then Lyney asks the Traveler and Paimon to follow him to their home.
----
;The City of Rains and Remembrance

Arriving at Lyney and Lynette's home, they run into [[Freminet]] outside the front door and ask him where everyone else went. Freminet tells them that everyone went out, prompting Lyney to state that "[[Arlecchino|Father]]" was returning soon. Freminet then asks Lyney about something in private, after which he collects the materials for the Magic Pockets. Suddenly, the sky begins to darken and rain breaks loose, surprising Paimon. Lyney tells them that the weather usually changes when trials take place while Freminet looks at the sky. He tells Paimon he heard story that the Hydro Dragon used to live in Fontaine. While no one knew where it went, people believe that when it wept, the skies cloud up and rain.

The rain lasts longer than usual, so Lyney decides to finish some business and asks Freminet to take the supplies to the workshop. Freminet is too scared to go, being an introvert, so the Traveler offers to it for him. Arriving at Beaumont Workshop, they hand the items to Estelle. She tells them they don't have to pay, as Lyney did so in advance. Paimon is impressed by the machine she use. Estelle tells her that the machine runs on Indemnitium, a source of power made from the trials at the court. She then talks about another source of energy before being rudely interrupted by [[Truand]] and his lackeys from the [[Confrerie of Cabriere]]. As the Traveler tries try to leave, [[Tartaglia|Childe]] unexpectedly appears and warns the group of their own debt to [[Northland Bank]]. Paimon waves at Childe, surprising him. He says he was getting bored and their arrival meant things would get interesting.

Childe continues his talk with the Traveler and Paimon, angering Truand to the point that he and his lackeys attack. Childe easily overwhelms them, with the Traveler and Paimon serving as witnesses to his actions being made in self-defence. Truand then realizes that Childe is actually one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]], but Childe suddenly loses control of his Hydro weapons and they vanish. Truand takes the opportunity to attack, but Childe knocks him out with a single punch. The Traveler, Paimon and Childe wonder what happened, though Childe reasures them that he still has his [[Delusion]] as a backup. Paimon asks what he's doing in Fontaine. Childe tells them that he has been in a bad mood recently and began to feel something stirring inside him. Paimon surmises that this might be the cause of his Hydro Vision weakening. Childe then tells them about his time in the [[Abyss]], including his meeting with [[Skirk]], who took him as an apprentice because he had "it" on him and her lessons would help in the future.

Childe then reveals that while he's been idling around in Fontaine, he's been sparring with their official Champion Duelists. Childe explains that before going to court, the accused are given one chance to redeem their honor in a duel against a Champion Duelist, but they are some of the nation's strongest fighters. If the defendant wins, the charges are dropped, but if they lose, they must go to trial, though some simply die and rarely anyone has ever been freed in such a manner. Childe states that he was about to spar with Clorinde. Then, in light of recent events, he gives the Traveler his Vision for safekeeping so that it doesn't get in the way of his duel, before leaving.

Heading to the [[Fountain of Lucine]], the Traveler hears a mysterious voice as Lynette appears to greet them. They ask her about the voice, so she gives them a theory about the tears that eventually flow into the fountain holding intense emotions. She then takes them inside the opera house to catch up with Lyney, believing a talk with him would allow him to cool his nerves before the big show. Inside, Lyney gives them tickets to the best seats before being called by [[Cowell]] to handle the props. As they go inside to their seats, they find a man seated next to them, resulting in a long, awkward moment. The man then apologizes, with Paimon introducing herself and the Traveler. The man had heard about their travels across Teyvat and attempts to introduce himself, only for Lyney to come in and call him by his name, [[Neuvillette]], being pleased to see he was going to watch his show. Lyney properly introduces Neuvillette to the two, even showing the seat at the top of the court which the chief justice uses. Neuvillette then tells the Traveler that Furina was trying to get their attention, so they look at her briefly, which he deems enough to satisfy her.

As the audience trickles into the opera, Lyney and Lynette begin the show. Lyney performs some small tricks before bringing in a water tank. He does a trick to make Lynette disappear inside the tank before she reappears outside, which entertains Furina and the guests. Paimon is left shocked at how he was able to pull it off. Neuvillette tells her that she should be focusing on the show and not the hidden tricks. Lyney then pulls out two magic boxes and uses a machine to "randomly" select an audience member. In the process Lyney has some difficulty in finishing the trick. While he successfully gets out of his own box, the audience member fails to do so. The water tank from earlier falls, crushing the box and leaving Lyney shocked. Neuvillette puts the entire opera house into lockdown. After a quick investigation, Neuvillette reveals that Cowell was found dead in the box and the girl from the audience has gone missing, making her the latest victim in the serial disappearances of women case. Furina then declares Lyney a suspect due to the circumstances involved. Neuvillette then asks Furina if she was going to press charges on Lyney, which surprises her. However, in order to please the audience, she ends up declaring a duel between her and the Traveler.

Neuvillette then declares a trial the following day, assigning the Traveler as Lyney's attorney, while Furina wonders what the Traveler would do in the trial. As everyone leaves, the Traveler and Paimon talk with Lyney and Lynette, who are relieved that they have their support for the upcoming trial.

;Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights
As they go to collect evidence, the Traveler and Paimon speak to [[Esmond]], who believes that Lyney is truly the suspect. Searching around, they begin to build up a case to defend Lyney. During the process, they run into a mysterious woman guarded by two men in black suits. She introduces the group as [[Navia]], [[Silver]] and [[Melus]] of the [[Spina di Rosula]], an investigation organization. Navia agrees to help, as she sees the trials as something more serious and her group is also after the truth behind the disappearances. After showing how they performed the magic box trick, Lyney and Lynette are escorted out. This leaves the Traveler, Paimon, Navia and her associates to investigate the tunnel under the stage that they used. During the investigation, the group discovers many irregularities and Paimon jots down notes. Navia suggests they go to collect their thoughts, but Melus tells them that they are now associated with the twins, so they cannot leave until the trial concludes. As the group needs some tea and snacks, Melus reveals a baking stove and Silver takes out ingredients, which Navia uses to make macarons. Paimon takes two extra macarons, but swears she's taken the same amount as everyone else. The trio then leave to collect more information, so the Traveler waits the following day for the trial to start.

The next day, Neuvillette declares the trial to start while both parties give their statements. When Lyney maintains his innocence, Furina points out that around the half-way mark, there was a loud thud and expresses doubt that he could not have heard it, surprising him, while the scales tilt in her favor. She then exposes them as members of from the [[House of the Hearth]], surprising the Traveler and Paimon with their friends' [[Fatui]] background. This results in the audience supporting Furina's claims while she notices the Traveler is speechless, believing herself to have won. Neuvillette asks Lyney to confirm this, and he does, resulting in the scale dropping further towards Furina. The Traveler then requests a recess, which Neuvillette grants for an hour.

At the opera's backstage, Lyney expresses surprise that Furina would have dug deep into their past, while the Traveler and Paimon are upset by the deception and that they were Fatui members. The twins apologize for not being more transparent, but Lyney insists that he is innocent in this case. The Traveler agrees to help see justice served correctly, so Lyney begins telling them his perspective of the events - he wanted to investigate the Oratrice's core, but ended up retreating when a voice called out to him. When he got back into the tunnel, he saw the smashed vase and scattered clothes, though he could not give it much thought as the countdown was about to end.

Furina manages to regain some of the audience's sway after the Traveler is unable to deduce the full truth, but the Traveler then realizes that they need to go from another angle. They request to inspect Cowell's belongings, believing he may have used the water from the tank to take another form. Furina finds this absurd, as it's only a magic trick. However, Neuvillette agrees to the request so that the trial can progress. Esmond then comes in and reveals that Cowell's bag had labeled tubes of water from the Primordial Sea and that he belonged to an organization selling illegal drugs. Navia then realizes that something and leaves with her associates.

With the new evidence supporting Lyney's innocence, Neuvillette allows the Traveler to continue with their hypothesis, tilting the scales towards Lyney's favor. Furina, on the other hand, becomes worried about having wrongly accused someone, even agreeing slightly with their reasoning. Neuvillette then brings in Vaughn, having been informed of new evidence found; the same water was found in Lyney's belongings. Furina uses the opportunity to cement her claim, knowing that the Traveler has nothing to defend against it. However, before the sentencing can start, Navia bursts in with new evidence. She reveals the box from before and asks Lyney to repeat the trick. Lyney snaps his fingers and the missing woman from the audience reappears. She confesses to the entire crime and reveals that she was actually [[Liliane]], not Halsey. She was the thief that the Traveler and Lyney were chasing at the harbor. She stole a ticket and came to the show to relax. She became terrified when the random number generator picked her and Lyney mentioning the [[Fortress of Meropide]] (a prison), believing he was onto her.

Now relating the story in Liliane's perspective, the scales tip towards Lyney's favor, leaving Furina shocked and unable to muster any words. She admits defeat and Neuvillette puts the information into the Oratice, which returns a "Not Guilty" verdict to acquit Lyney and Lynette. However, Neuvillette does remark that both Lyney and Liliane's conduct should warrant additional investigation. Neuvillette then realizes that Vaughn was Cowell's accomplice because he previously presented false evidence to frame Lyney. Furina yells at him for deceiving her judgement and Neuvillette recommends he confess to everything and seek the protection of the [[Garde]]s. Vaughn begins to confess to the entire plot, but before he could reveal the identity of the "Boss", he dissolves into water. Neuvillette orders another inspection on the entire audience, though no evidence is yielded.

With the case over, Lyney and Lynette talk to the Traveler again, thanking them for their help and apologizing for the deception. They explain that, as orphans, their goals aligned with the House of the Hearth and the Knave. After their parents died, he and Lynette were able to survive after watching a street performer's show. After being adopted by a noble, Lyney became horrified when he learned that she was being trafficked to another noble because of her appearance. He went to rescue her, but when he arrived, the Knave had already slain the noble, rescuing her and several others before offering them a spot in the House of the Hearth. Lyney reveals that the Knave, who is also known as [[Arlecchino]], believed in the prophecy. Thus, before she took the [[Gnosis|Hydro Gnosis]] to [[Snezhnaya]], she would try to use it to save their home, Fontaine. Lyney apologizes again for the deception but promises to help should they need it.

As the Traveler prepares to leave the opera, Navia and her associates manage to catch up, believing that the whole case is not solved yet. However, she learns from them that they were only there to defend Lyney, not the disappearances case. Despite this, she decides to have a farewell meal at [[Hotel Debord]], which the Traveler and Paimon agree to.
