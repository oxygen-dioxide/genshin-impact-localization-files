==Dialogue==
===First Encounter===
{{Quest Description|Sun Yu, a disciple of the [[Guhua Clan]], seems to be deep in thought about something...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sun Yu)
:'''Sun Yu:''' *sigh* [[Little Que'er|Que'er]]...
:{{DIcon}} Sun Yu?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler? What a coincidence! I didn't expect to see you here...
:'''Sun Yu:''' I... I'm doing some training here, and I'm about to leave Liyue soon to travel abroad.
:{{DIcon}} What's with the trip away all of a sudden?
:{{DIcon}} Aren't you going to revive the Guhua Clan?
:'''Sun Yu:''' *sigh* Well, this is kind of embarrassing... I've long been talking about reviving the Guhua Clan, but what I've been doing all this time... This so-called "seeking the guidance of the [[adepti]]" is merely just me hanging about in [[Jueyun Karst]]...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Although I'm grateful to Que'er for her company, deep down I'm aware that such behavior is nothing but meaningless to the revival of the Guhua Clan...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Some time ago, when I was doing grocery shopping back in the city, I happened to have a conversation with a merchant from [[Fontaine]].
:'''Sun Yu:''' He said to me, "You can't find the solution to a problem at the place of its occurrence."
:'''Sun Yu:''' I've pondered over these words for quite a while. Perhaps, this Fontaine merchant was suggesting that I travel to places other than Liyue.
:{{DIcon}} Traveling can be eye-opening.
:{{DIcon}} Take it simply as a distraction even.
:'''Sun Yu:''' That's exactly what I thought! But... Que'er doesn't want to leave Liyue.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Usually, her bouts of temper aren't serious and can often even be meant in jest. It doesn't take much for me to placate her.
:'''Sun Yu:''' But this time, she seemed to be really infuriated. No matter what I said, she refused to listen, and she even ran back to the city alone... *sigh*
:'''Sun Yu:''' But I'm not gonna bore you further with these trivial things. That aside, Traveler, can I ask you for a favor?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Although I've learned some defensive techniques before, I hardly ever really tried my skills out. If I'm going to travel abroad, I'll definitely run into some sort of fight sooner or later...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, I've heard many stories of you adventuring all over the world, and you must know a lot of ways to deal with monsters.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Can you accompany me to find some monsters around and fight them? You know, offer me some guidance along the way as well?
:{{DIcon}} No problem.
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid you can't see my moves clearly.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Y&mdash;You are really that skilled? Hahaha, well, then please do me another favor and slow down a bit.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Let's see... There's one place where monsters gather right ahead. Let's go the first, shall we?

;(Approach the hilichurl roadblock)
:'''Sun Yu:''' This's the place. Let's do it!

;(After defeating all opponents)
:'''Sun Yu:''' *huff* That was tough...
:'''Sun Yu:''' I apologize. Look at me, making a fool of myself. I didn't expect that I would be so nervous when confronting real monsters...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Needless to say, I still need more training. Anyway, thank you, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
:{{DIcon}} Are you really leaving?
:'''Sun Yu:''' I haven't fully decided yet. I still need more time to think it through. Meanwhile, I'll see if I can convince Que'er to leave with me...
{{Dialogue End}}

===First Day of Training===
{{Quest Description|Sun Yu, a disciple of the Guhua Clan, appears to be practicing hard...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sun Yu)
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, we meet again.
:{{DIcon}} Are you still training here?<!-- There's a possible dialogue mapping error with these 2 choices. I contacted Hoyoverse about it, so it may be patched later. -->
::'''Sun Yu:''' Indeed I am. It's just... so much harder than I expected. I don't know if I'm really that weak, or if I've adopted the wrong method...
::'''Sun Yu:''' Anyway, enough about that. The last time when we fought monsters together, your moves turned out to be quite inspirational.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, please do me a favor and accompany me for another round of training, will you?
::{{DIcon}} You've trained here before?
::{{DIcon}} Didn't know you could train in a place like this...
:::'''Sun Yu:''' I'm... a bit embarrassed to admit this, but I came here mainly because of the complex terrain and the roaming monsters. I thought it would be a great place to train. The only thing I didn't account for was how hard it was to get here...
::'''Sun Yu:''' Thankfully, I met a helpful adventurer. She lent me a hand and, using a "mutually executable commission" as an excuse, she brought me in with her.
::'''Sun Yu:''' She even helped me organize a training regimen and offered me all sorts of advice... But, at the same time, I have to help her deal with some commissions for the Adventurers' Guild.
:{{DIcon}} Is Que'er still ignoring you?
::'''Sun Yu:''' Well... She said she had things to do in the city recently, and she hasn't returned...
::'''Sun Yu:''' I've paid her a couple of visits, but she just sends [[Zhiruo]] out to make me go away. She still refuses to see me.
::'''Sun Yu:''' *sigh* I honestly don't know what to say to her now...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Ahem... Alright, let's get down to business, Traveler.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Here's the thing. I've initiated a training plan for myself that includes fighting monsters and cross-country training.
:'''Sun Yu:''' It's all up to you which one you'd like to help me focus on today, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} Monster fight.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Brilliant! I've long wanted to put the swordsmanship I learned into practice...
::{{DIcon}} I'm afraid you can't see my moves clearly.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Y&mdash;You are really that skilled? Hahaha, well, then please do me another favor and slow down a bit.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Let's see... There's one place where monsters gather right ahead. Let's go there first, shall we?
::;(Go to [[#Monster Fighting|Monster Fighting]])
:{{DIcon}} Cross-country training.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Brilliant! I've asked an adventurer to help me chart an off-road route... You know, it was only with her help that I was able to train here at all.
::'''Sun Yu:''' She said I just need to reach the destination as quickly as possible. But it seems that I was never quick enough...
::'''Sun Yu:''' So, can you demonstrate how to do it quickly? I'll try my best to keep up.
::{{DIcon}} No problem.
::{{DIcon}} Try not to be left too far behind.
:::'''Sun Yu:''' I&mdash;I'll certainly try. But to be completely honest, I wasn't built a runner in any sense...
::'''Sun Yu:''' Anyway, I'll be counting on you then. Let's head to the starting point, shall we?
::;(Go to [[#Cross-Country Training|Cross-Country Training]])

===Subsequent Days of Training===
;(Talk to Sun Yu)
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, we meet again.
:{{DIcon}} Are you still training here?
::'''Sun Yu:''' Indeed I am. It's just... so much harder than I expected. I don't know if I'm really that weak, or if I've adopted the wrong method...
:{{DIcon}} Is Que'er still ignoring you?
::'''Sun Yu:''' Well... She said she had things to do in the city recently, and she hasn't returned...

::'''Sun Yu:''' *sigh* I honestly don't know what to say to her now...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Anyway, enough about that. The last time when we fought monsters together, your moves turned out to be quite inspirational.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, please do me a favor and accompany me for another round of training, will you?
:'''Sun Yu:''' And just like the last time, monster fight or cross-country training? All up to you.
:{{DIcon}} Monster fight.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Brilliant! I've long wanted to put the swordsmanship I learned into practice...
::{{DIcon}} I'm afraid you can't see my moves clearly.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Y&mdash;You are really that skilled? Hahaha, well, then please do me another favor and slow down a bit.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Let's see... There's one place where monsters gather right ahead. Let's go there first, shall we?
::;(Go to [[#Monster Fighting|Monster Fighting]])
:{{DIcon}} Cross-country training.
:;(If the option has not been picked previously)
:::'''Sun Yu:''' Brilliant! I've asked an adventurer to help me chart an off-road route... You know, it was only with her help that I was able to train here at all.
:::'''Sun Yu:''' She said I just need to reach the destination as quickly as possible. But it seems that I was never quick enough...
:;(If the option has been picked previously)
:::'''Sun Yu:''' Brilliant! Let's keep to the off-road trails we used before to train.
:::'''Sun Yu:''' The adventurer said that I just need to reach the destination as quickly as possible. But I've never quite been quick enough...
::'''Sun Yu:''' Could you demonstrate how to do it quickly? I'll try my best to keep up.
::{{DIcon}} No problem.
::{{DIcon}} Try not to be left too far behind.
:::'''Sun Yu:''' I&mdash;I'll certainly try. But to be completely honest, I wasn't built a runner in any sense...
::'''Sun Yu:''' Anyway, I'll be counting on you then. Let's head to the starting point, shall we?
::;(Go to [[#Cross-Country Training|Cross-Country Training]])

===Monster Fighting===
;(Approach the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Sun Yu:''' How come there're so many Treasure Hoarders here!? An&mdash;Anyway, let's do this!

;(After defeating all opponents)
:'''Sun Yu:''' *huff* That was tough...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Look at me, making a fool of myself again. I guess I haven't made much progress after all...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Needless to say, I still need more training. Thank you, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
:{{DIcon}} How are you going to leave Liyue?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Well... My current plan is to take the merchant's boat and travel by water.
:'''Sun Yu:''' As for my first stop... I'm thinking about Fontaine. I'll probably stay there for a while and make further plans from there.
:'''Sun Yu:''' *sigh* I wonder if I'll be able to convince Que'er to travel with me...

----
===Cross-Country Training===
;(During training)
:'''Sun Yu:''' *huff* *huff* *huff*

;(After training)
:'''Sun Yu:''' *huff* *huff* How... How could you... run so fast...
:{{DIcon}} You are a slow runner.
::'''Sun Yu:''' I&mdash;I concede...
:{{DIcon}} You still need more training.
::'''Sun Yu:''' *huff* You are absolutely right...
;(If this is the first day of training)
::'''Sun Yu:''' *huff* Finally I get to catch my breath. Oh my, never thought it could be so exhausting...
::'''Sun Yu:''' Thank you for the demonstration, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
;(If this is not the first day of training)
::'''Sun Yu:''' Thank you for the demonstration, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
::{{DIcon}} About Que'er...
:::'''Sun Yu:''' *sigh* She still won't talk to me. I&mdash;I've run out of ideas...
:::'''Sun Yu:''' How did this become such a dilemma...
::{{DIcon}} About that adventurer...
:::'''Sun Yu:''' That adventurer? I met her at the Adventurers' Guild.
:::'''Sun Yu:''' She told me that she had accepted a commission from the Guild to work in The Chasm. When she heard that I wanted to come in here, she agreed to take me with her without much hesitation.
:::'''Sun Yu:''' But in exchange, I must help her with her commission. Mostly just to look for things though, nothing too toilsome.
:::'''Sun Yu:''' It's just... that she's crazily talkative. I had no idea how to deal with people like that...

===Day 1 of Departure===
{{Quest Description|The day Sun Yu will depart from Liyue Harbor is fast approaching...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sun Yu:''' Liyue... I wonder when I'll come back...
:{{DIcon}} What's the matter?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Ah, Traveler! It's you!
:'''Sun Yu:''' Well, my itinerary to Fontaine has finally been decided, and in a few days, I'll set off with that merchant.
:'''Sun Yu:''' He's still got some business stuff to deal with. And I'm taking advantage of this time to make sure I've packed everything.
:{{DIcon}} You are not going to visit Jueyun Karst one last time?
:{{DIcon}} You are not going to walk around this place one last time?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Haha, I might regret my decision if I were to do that.
:'''Sun Yu:''' I'll just take a look around the city from here. I've lived here for so long, and this time, I don't even know when I'll be able to come back.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Oh, by the way, Que'er... *sigh* She hasn't agreed to go with me in the end, but I already asked Zhiruo to take care of her.
:'''Sun Yu:''' I've also left some of my savings to her. She's much brighter than I am. She can take care of herself.
:'''Sun Yu:''' And perhaps one day, she'll understand my decision.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Right, Traveler, can I ask you one more favor?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Could you please fetch me some soil?
:{{DIcon}} I can help with that...
:{{DIcon}} What do you need it for?
:'''Sun Yu:''' For someone like me who is about to leave his hometown, he'd want to bring some souvenirs with him, right?
:'''Sun Yu:''' With Liyue's soil carried with me, I can at least say that I haven't been completely disconnected from this land.
:{{DIcon}} Why don't you fetch it yourself?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Hahaha... Like I said, if I were to walk around this place, tons of memories would sure come flooding back...
:'''Sun Yu:''' And then, I'm afraid that the little courage I've finally mustered to leave my hometown would disappear.
:'''Sun Yu:''' So, I can only leave the task to you, Traveler. I'll mark the location for you.
:{{DIcon}} What's so special about that place?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Ahem... I used to practice my swordsmanship with Que'er there...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Anyway! I'll be leaving the task to you, Traveler.

;(Talk to Sun Yu again, optional)
:'''Sun Yu:''' I'll be leaving the task to you, Traveler.

;(Approach the location)
:'''Paimon:''' This is the location that Sun Yu marked for us. Let's take some soil here and bring it back to him.

;(Talk to Little Que'er or Zhiruo at the pond northwest of the dig location, optional)
:'''Little Que'er:''' He must've been on purpose, Zhiruo! He just... He just doesn't want to be with me! *whimper*
:'''Zhiruo:''' Que'er, you and he have spent so much time together, he must know what you're thinking.
:'''Zhiruo:''' This time, he's determined to leave Liyue and travel abroad, he must have his reasons. So what's the harm if you travel with him?
:'''Little Que'er:''' I just don't want to leave here! What's wrong with us staying here forever? The Guhua Clan... I couldn't care less about the Guhua Clan!
:'''Zhiruo:''' Then why don't you tell him that?
:'''Little Que'er:''' I... *sigh* He's been drawn to the whole idea of reviving the Clan. If he knew I'd said that, he must hate me...
:'''Zhiruo:''' *sigh* Que'er...

;(Talk to Sun Yu after collecting the [[Boxful of Homeland Soil]])
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, did you bring back the soil for me?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} It's here.
:;(Submit {{Item|Boxful of Homeland Soil|x=1}})
:'''Sun Yu:''' Thank you, it should be enough.
:{{DIcon}} You don't look too excited.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Ahahaha... Sorry, I don't want to put you out or anything...
::'''Sun Yu:''' It's just that I still feel a little reluctant to suddenly leave Liyue, where I've lived for so long.
:{{DIcon}} When are you leaving?
::'''Sun Yu:''' Once the supplies are ready, we will set off.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Oh yes, the adventurer who took me to The Chasm will also travel with us.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Hearing that I'm heading over to Fontaine, she said she was also intrigued and decided to come with us.
::'''Sun Yu:''' The merchant is happy to have another adventurer to protect him. But to be honest, I'm really not good at communicating with people who are that enthusiastic... *sigh*
::'''Sun Yu:''' Never thought that I'd travel this far one day...
{{Dialogue End}}

----
===Day 2 of Departure===
{{Quest Description|Sun Yu seems to be preparing to depart Liyue Harbor...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sun Yu)
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, thank goodness you're here. I almost thought you wouldn't be back today.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Today is the day I depart from Liyue Harbor. I have troubled you so much before... I have to thank you properly.
:'''Sun Yu:''' ...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Ahem... I was just thinking about what to say after seeing you.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Now it's time for me to actually talk, I somehow don't even remember any of the words... Look at me, making a fool of myself even now, haha.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry about it. I'm sure we'll meet again soon.
:{{DIcon}} I'll pay you a visit in Fontaine sometime.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Really? Haha, that's wonderful news! I'll show you around when you get there!
:'''Sun Yu:''' Well, I actually still have one last favor to ask. You have a Kamera, right? Do you mind taking a picture for me?
:'''Sun Yu:''' A sailor told me that it's best to keep a picture of your hometown with you when you are traveling abroad.
:'''Sun Yu:''' But I don't own a Kamera, so maybe you'd be kind enough to help me out.
:{{DIcon}} No problem.
:{{DIcon}} Strike a pose!
::'''Sun Yu:''' P&mdash;Pose!? I&mdash;It's about the scenery behind me!

;(Talk to Sun Yu again, optional)
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, I'm counting on you to take the picture for me.

;(Talk to Sun Yu after taking the photo)<!--Please adjust camera angle correctly to face Liyue Harbor-->
:'''Sun Yu:''' Thank you, Traveler. This picture is just perfect.
:'''Sun Yu:''' ...
:'''Sun Yu:''' *sigh* It's finally time to go. When I hear people say things like "A great man is ready to realize his aspiration anywhere," or "It is better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books," I always feel so encouraged and inspired...
:'''Sun Yu:''' But when it is me who's finally about to set out, I don't feel encouraged or inspired at all. All I want to do is to stay here for a little longer...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Traveler, do you think I can find what I'm looking for during this journey?
:{{DIcon}} I don't know.
::'''Sun Yu:''' Hahaha... I mean, what am I even looking for? Do I even know it myself?
:{{DIcon}} It's all up to you.
::'''Sun Yu:''' So... you are saying it's all up to fate.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Right, it's about time. I'm going to meet up with that merchant. Please, Traveler, take these as your reward.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Que'er... She's not here after all...
