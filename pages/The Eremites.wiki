The '''Eremites'''<!-- sumeru teaser 03 official CC capitalizes the The... and it's inconsistent in-game, because nobody on the localization team knows consistency --> are a group of people who hail from [[Sumeru]]'s desert region. Most of them are mercenaries by trade and conduct business across [[Teyvat]].<ref name="APPA">{{Ref/Quest|A Particularly Particular Author}}</ref><ref name="SpiceWest">{{Ref/Quest|A Visitor From Westward Realms}}</ref> They are the only authorized mercenary organization in Sumeru.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Sumeru|The Eremites}}</ref>

==Overview==
{{Quote|Rather than a 'hero,' I'd call myself someone who 'isn't afraid of dying so that they might truly live.' This was something that a senior from Sumeru told me, and she herself heard it from the Eremites.|[[Zhiqiong]]|[[Valor's Afterglow (Quest)|Valor's Afterglow]]}}
The Eremites hail from the ancient, now-collapsed civilizations of the [[Great Red Sand]].<ref name="sumeru teaser 3">YouTube: ''[https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03: Prelude to Wisdom]''</ref> They are split into multiple factions and tribes, each with their own beliefs and codes of conduct, although these factions are not always mutually exclusive. Strife sometimes erupts between different Eremite groups, which is why consultants and advisors are appointed by [[Rukh Shah]] to facilitate communication. In fact, the name "Eremites" is simply a blanket term for all of the tribes of the desert, ignoring any of the distinctions between said tribes.<ref name="loremaster">{{Ref/Enemy|Eremite Scorching Loremaster}}</ref>

The Eremites "have a claim to part of the legacy" of the ancient civilizations they come from, "as a deterrent of last resort in a crisis."<ref name="sumeru teaser 3" /> They have passed down the knowledge of their ancestral civilization in oral form, though their stories are gradually disappearing or being distorted over the generations. Still, those among the Eremites who remember their history make sure to keep it alive.<ref name="loremaster" /> Their history also survives through their performing culture and combat style; for example, the combat skills of the [[Eremite Sword-Dancer]]s were passed down since the days of Deshret's civilization and are now an art as well as a combat style,<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Eremite Sword-Dancer}}</ref> and the Eremites' dance traditions were passed down from their ancestors' worship rituals.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Eremite Floral Ring-Dancer}}</ref> They can also be seen playing instruments, such as a tambourine and a lute-like stringed instrument.<!--Based on the historical oud?-->

As the Eremite mercenaries are very loosely organized, anyone can join them. Traditionally, only those hailing from the desert can join, but there have been a few exceptions, such as Rukh Shah.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sekkura}}</ref> Others simply use the name for their own benefit, causing unaware foreigners to hire them for a poor job, making the group as a whole looked down upon. One example is [[Kasim]], who uses the name for his own benefit and is known as a fraud by the [[Corps of Thirty]].

[[Nazafarin]], a scholar from Sumeru, has a negative perception of them and describes them as "true soldiers of fortune who will do anything for money," and goes on to state that some of its members wield "formidable" elemental powers.<ref name="SpiceWest" /> These powers are not inherent to the Eremites themselves, but are rather borrowed from [[Spirit of Omen|ancient desert spirits]] (or fragments thereof) which can manipulate the elements. These spirit fragments dwell within the Eremites' weapons and awaken during times of peril, to the boon of the Eremites wielding them.<ref name="TTWSFLT">{{Ref/Quest|The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears}}</ref> However, it is suggested that once the spirits awaken, they can only be satisfied once blood has spilt, whether of the Eremites or the other side.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Eremite Daythunder}}</ref>

The Eremites have an open partnership with the [[Adventurers' Guild]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wisdom Has Built Her House, She Has Hewn Out Her Seven Pillars}}</ref> and they conduct business all across Teyvat. For example, [[Younan]] often travels to [[Inazuma]] since his job involves facilitating international trade from Sumeru, while [[Irus]]' crew was commissioned by [[Jakob|an individual]] in [[Fontaine]]. [[Sumida]] once commissioned a member of the Eremites to assist her in the quest for the [[Maushiro (A Particularly Particular Author)|Maushiro]], to no avail.<ref name="APPA" /> The Eremites are also fond of [[Genius Invokation TCG]], and many can be seen across Sumeru playing the game.

==Factions==
===Corps of Thirty===
{{main|Corps of Thirty}}
The Corps of Thirty are members of the Eremites who guard Sumeru City.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Asfand}}</ref> They are based in the [[Citadel of Regzar]], to the northeastern side of Sumeru City. Unlike most other Eremites, they wear green scarves instead of red ones. Their name comes from the fact that the group had thirty founders, and they are said to be one of the oldest Eremite groups in Sumeru.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Rukh Shah}}</ref>

[[Dehya]] is a notable former member of the Corps of Thirty.

===Aybak's group===
[[Aybak]] is the leader of a group of Eremites in [[Caravan Ribat]]. This group is under contract with the Akademiya and is responsible for the security of Caravan Ribat, as well as maintenance of the [[Wall of Samiel]]. The group is very tight-knit and treats each other like family, calling each other brothers and sisters.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Aybak}}</ref>

===Rahman's faction===
[[Rahman]] has his own Eremite faction located near [[Valley of Dahri]]. Similar to Ayn Al-Ahmar, he and his faction are also believers of King Deshret and initially despised [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] and the forest folk. They even kidnapped the Village Keepers of [[Aaru Village]], believing that it would help bring about King Deshret's resurrection.

However, after witnessing the truth about the great deed of the previous Dendro Archon, Rahman and his group abandoned their prejudice. Realizing their true enemy was the Akademiya, they aided the Traveler's group in freeing Lesser Lord Kusanali, and are currently working with [[Setaria]] and the reformed Akademiya to promote education among the Eremites and other desert peoples.

===Blazing Beasts===
The Blazing Beasts are a group of Eremites, of which Dehya is the most renowned member. Dehya joined the Blazing Beasts at a young age, after her last argument with [[Kusayla]]; Kusayla secretly arranged the faction to rescue Dehya and ensured that she would leave Dakan Al-Ahmar without harassment from Deshret's Relics.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Annals of the Scarlet Sands}}</ref>

===Farrokhzadan===
{{Main|Farrokhzadan}}
The Farrokhzadan are a tribe of Eremites related to Agha Farrokh. They are currently led by [[Siman Farrokhzad]], Agha's daughter, and are assisting [[Il Dottore]] and the [[Fatui]] in their goal of capturing [[Aranara]].

===Thutmose===
The Thutmose are a group of Eremites active in the desert, and are also devout believers of King Deshret. To be able to explore the secret of Al-Ahmar, Thutmose has sought knowledge and collaborators from many sources, from Sumeru researchers to the Fatui. [[Jebrael]] and [[Samail]] were once referred to as the twin blades of Thutmose.

The Thutmose secret base is located on [[Lamb-Devourer Rock]].

===Tanit===
{{Main|Tanit}}
The Tanit were a nomadic Eremite tribe active in the desert led by their matriarch [[Babel]]. Their most recent campsite was at the southern border of the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]], where they relied on the wenut trade with outsiders. They would eventually be annihilated by the [[Traveler]] and [[Jeht]], after Babel's attempts to manipulate and get rid of them had failed.

===Deshret's Relics===
Deshret's Relics were formerly a large group of Eremites that blackmailed its members by making them leave behind "records" at their headquarters, which detailed something unpleasant about its members such as sins, unforgivable acts or immoral exploits, which they claimed was a sign of "loyalty." Following Kusayla's burning of the records, many left the group, leaving behind a few loyalists. The group was eventually dismantled by Dakan Al-Ahmar, Dehya and the Traveler, and its members taken into custody by the Corps of Thirty.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sincerity's Facade}}</ref>

====Ayn Al-Ahmar====
Ayn Al-Ahmar is a subgroup of Deshret's Relics<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shade Upon Red Silk}}</ref> that are active in [[Port Ormos]], led by [[Mizri]]. Like many Eremites, they are devout followers of [[King Deshret]], and view Greater Lord Rukkhadevata poorly in comparison to him. They take their name after King Deshret's alleged true name, Al-Ahmar. They were in competition with other Eremite factions in Port Ormos to obtain a Divine Knowledge Capsule rumored to hold the power of King Deshret, and succeeded in obtaining it through an auction. However, Mizri went mad after using the knowledge capsule and briefly rampaged before being defeated by [[Alhaitham]], who secretly took the Divine Knowledge Capsule from them afterwards.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ever So Close}}</ref>

====Dakan Al-Ahmar====
Dakan Al-Ahmar was a subgroup of Deshret's Relics led by Dehya's father [[Kusayla]]. After Kusayla's death, the group sought revenge on Deshret's Relics. They began conducting raids on not only members of the Relics, but on merchant caravans and innocent citizens as well, seeking to accumulate resources for their crusade against the Relics. After Deshret's Relics was destroyed and their revenge was fulfilled, Dakan Al-Ahmar's remaining members surrendered themselves to the Corps of Thirty for their crimes.

===The Caracal Battalion===
The Caracal Battalion is an Eremite faction active in Port Ormos. They were in competition with other factions such as Ayn Al-Ahmar to claim a Divine Knowledge Capsule rumored to hold the power of King Deshret. [[Tariq]] and [[Tumart]] of Ayn Al-Ahmar claim that, unlike them, the Caracal Battalion is "nothing but a bunch of money-grubbing opportunists out for a quick Mora."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in Prosperity}}</ref>

===Afiyah===
The Afiyah are a nomadic Eremite tribe in the Desert of Hadramaveth. Members of the tribe colluded with [[Aderfi]] of the Tanit to ambush the [[Traveler]] and take [[Liloupar]].<ref name="TTWSFLT"/>

===Others===
Two other known Eremite tribes are the Uzza and the Shimti, both of which are said to have matriarchs and venerate the [[Nabu Malikata|Goddess of Flowers]], like the Tanit. All three matriarchs refer to themselves as "Daughters of the Flower Goddess."<ref>{{Ref/Arti|A Moment Congealed}}</ref>

Other Eremite tribes and brigades operate on their own accord. They usually only receive commissions from individuals or families to act as bodyguards, and do not have a clear operating structure like other factions.

==Trivia==
* Lion and its tales are the famous stories among the Eremites, representing the unyielding spirit of the desert dwellers. Some Eremites have "Lion" in their titles, such as Dehya<ref group="Note">Dehya's Chinese title, {{Lang|zh=炽鬃之狮|zh_tl=Lion of Blazing Mane}}, is the origin of the English localization "Flame-Mane"</ref> and [[Jehiet]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kurash}}</ref>
* Fire is an important symbol for the Eremites, much like for [[Natlan]]'s warriors &mdash; they believe that "only valor's flame shall never be extinguished." Building a campfire will boost team morale, and putting out an enemy's campfire will effectively demoralize them.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|The Eremites' Flame of Vigor}}</ref>
* In the case of a dire emergency of running out of food and water, Eremites have learned to bleed their [[Sumpter Beast]]s for fluid as a last resort.<ref>Interactable: [[Damaged Records#Damaged Records: I|Damaged Records: I]]</ref>
* {{Furnishing Mentions|are=1}}

===Etymology===
* The name ''Eremite'' is likely derived from the Ancient Greek word {{Lang|mini=1|grc=ἐρημίτης|grc_rm=erēmítēs}}, meaning "of the desert."
** The Ancient Greek word is also the origin of the English words ''{{wt|eremite||English}}'' and ''{{w|hermit}}'', both of which originally referred to those who secluded themselves in the desert for spiritual enlightenment.
* Its Chinese name, {{zh|镀金旅团}}, uses the phrase {{zh|{{wt|鍍金|镀金|Chinese}}}}, which literally means "gilded" or "gold-plated" but figuratively means making something ordinary appear special.
** As a metaphor, the phrase has a pejorative connotation and refers to people who go leave for other places to polish their qualifications despite lacking the actual skills.
