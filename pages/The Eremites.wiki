==Overview==
{{Quote|Rather than a 'hero,' I'd call myself someone who 'isn't afraid of dying so that they might truly live.' This was something that a senior from Sumeru told me, and she herself heard it from the Eremite.|[[Zhiqiong]]|[[Valor's Afterglow (Quest)]]}}
The Eremites are mercenaries who hail from an ancient civilization in Sumeru's desert.<ref name="sumeru teaser 3">YouTube: ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03: Prelude to Wisdom]''</ref>

[[Nazafarin]], a scholar from Sumeru, has a negative perception of them and describes them as "true soldiers of fortune who will do anything for money," and goes on to state that some of its members wield "bizarre yet formidable powers."<ref name="SpiceWest" />

[[Sumida]] once commissioned a member of the Eremite to assist her in the quest for the [[Maushiro]], to no avail.<ref name="APPA" />

The Eremites also "have a claim to part of the legacy" of the ancient civilization they come from, "as a deterrent of last resort in a crisis."<ref name="sumeru teaser 3" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*The English word {{wt|eremite||English}} means "hermit" or "religious recluse."
*Its Chinese name, {{lang|mini=1|zh=镀金旅团}}, uses the phrase {{lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|鍍金|镀金|Chinese}}}}, which literally means "gold-plated" but figuratively means making something ordinary appear special.
**As a metaphor, the phrase has a pejorative connotation and refers to people who go leave for other places to polish their qualifications despite lacking the actual skills.
