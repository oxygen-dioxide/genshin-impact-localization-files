The '''Eremites'''<!-- sumeru teaser 03 official CC capitalizes the The... and it's inconsistent in-game, because nobody on the localization team knows consistency --> are a group of people who hail from [[Sumeru]]'s desert region. Most of them are mercenaries by trade and conduct business across [[Teyvat]].<ref name="APPA">{{Ref/Quest|A Particularly Particular Author}}</ref><ref name="SpiceWest">{{Ref/Quest|A Visitor From Westward Realms}}</ref>

==Overview==
{{Quote|Rather than a 'hero,' I'd call myself someone who 'isn't afraid of dying so that they might truly live.' This was something that a senior from Sumeru told me, and she herself heard it from the Eremites.|[[Zhiqiong]]|[[Valor's Afterglow (Quest)]]}}
The Eremites hail from an ancient civilization in Sumeru's desert.<ref name="sumeru teaser 3">YouTube: ''[https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03: Prelude to Wisdom]''</ref> They are split into multiple factions, each with their own beliefs and code of conduct, although some Eremites may travel between different groups and these factions are not mutually exclusive. Strife sometimes erupts between different Eremite groups, which is why consultants and advisors are appointed by [[Rukh Shah]] to facilitate communication.

As the Eremites are a loosely organized group, anyone can join them. Traditionally only those hailing from the desert can join, but there have been a few exceptions, such as [[Rukh Shah]]<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sekkura}}</ref>. Others simply use the name for their own benefit, causing unaware foreigners to hire them for a poor job, making the group as a whole looked down upon, such as [[Kasim]], who uses the name for his own benefit and is known as a fraud by the [[Corps of Thirty]].

The Eremites are fond of [[Genius Invokation TCG]], as several can be seen across Sumeru playing the game.

[[Nazafarin]], a scholar from Sumeru, has a negative perception of them and describes them as "true soldiers of fortune who will do anything for money," and goes on to state that some of its members wield "bizarre yet formidable powers."<ref name="SpiceWest" /> [[Azariq]], an Eremite with access to such powers, mentions that these powers are borrowed from ancient spirits that can manipulate the elements, and are not inherent to the Eremites.<ref name="TTWSFLT">{{Ref/Quest|The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears }}</ref>

[[Sumida]] once commissioned a member of the Eremites to assist her in the quest for the [[Maushiro]], to no avail.<ref name="APPA" />

The Eremites also "have a claim to part of the legacy" of the ancient civilization they come from, "as a deterrent of last resort in a crisis."<ref name="sumeru teaser 3" />

==Factions==
===Corps of Thirty===
{{main|Corps of Thirty}}
The Corps of Thirty are members of the Eremites who guard Sumeru City.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Asfand}}</ref> They are based in the [[Citadel of Regzar]], to the northeastern side of Sumeru City. Unlike most other Eremites, they wear green scarves instead of red ones.

[[Dehya]] is a notable former member of the Corps of Thirty.

===Rahman's faction===
[[Rahman]] has his own faction located near [[Valley of Dahri]]. Similar to Ayn Al-Ahmar, he and his faction are also believers of King Deshret and initially despised Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and the forest folk. However, after witnessing the truth about the great deed of the previous Dendro Archon, Rahman and his group have abandoned their prejudice.

===Blazing Beasts===
The Blazing Beasts are a group of Eremites which Dehya is the most renowned member. It's likely this group from where the title "Lion" has been passed on.<ref group="Note">Dehya's Chinese title, {{Lang|zh = 炽鬃之狮|zh_tl = Lion of Blazing Mane}}, is the origin of the English localization "Flame-Mane"</ref>

It is speculated that [[Jehiet]] was a former member of Blazing Beasts, as she bore the title "Lioness".<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kurash}}</ref>

===Farrokhzadan===
{{Main|Farrokhzadan}}
The Farrokhzadan are a group of Eremites related to Agha Farrokh. They are currently led by [[Siman Farrokhzad]], Agha's daughter, and are assisting [[Il Dottore]] and the [[Fatui]] in their goal of capturing [[Aranara]].

===Thutmose===
The Thutmose are a group of Eremites active in the desert, and are also devout believers of King Deshret. To be able to explore the secret of Al-Ahmar, Thutmose has sought knowledge and collaborators from many sources, from Sumeru researchers to the Fatui. [[Jebrael]] and [[Samail]] were once referred to as the twin blades of Thutmose.

The Thutmose secret base is located on [[Lamb-Devourer Rock]].

===Tanit===
{{Main|Tanit}}
The Tanit were an Eremite tribe active in the desert led by their matriarch [[Babel]]. They lived at the southern border of the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]], where they relied on the wenut trade with outsiders. They would eventually be annihilated by the [[Traveler]] and [[Jeht]], after Babel's attempts to manipulate and get rid of them had failed.

===Deshret's Relics===
Deshret's Relics were formerly a large group of Eremites that blackmailed its members by making them leave behind "records" at their headquarters, which detailed something unpleasant about its members such as sins, unforgivable acts or immoral exploits, which they claimed was a sign of "loyalty". Following Kusayla's burning of the records, many left the group, leaving behind a few loyalists. The group was eventually dismantled by Dakan Al-Ahmar, Dehya and the Traveler and its members taken into custody by the Corps of Thirty.

====Ayn Al-Ahmar====
Ayn Al-Ahmar is a subgroup of Deshret's Relics that are active in [[Port Ormos]]. Like many Eremites, they are devout followers of [[King Deshret]], and view [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] poorly in comparison to him. They take their name after King Deshret's alleged true name, Al-Ahmar.

====Dakan Al-Ahmar====
Dakan Al-Ahmar was a subgroup of Deshret's Relics led by Dehya's father [[Kusayla]]. After Kusayla's death, the group sought revenge on Deshret's Relics. They began conducting raids on not only members of the Relics, but on merchant caravans and innocent citizens as well, seeking to accumulate resources for their crusade against the Relics. After Deshret's Relics was destroyed and their revenge was fulfilled, Dakan Al-Ahmar's remaining members surrendered themselves to the Corps of Thirty for their crimes.

===Others===
Other Eremites operate on their own accord, receiving commissions from individuals or families instead.

==Trivia==
* Like the [[Treasure Hoarders]], the Eremites are also capable of escaping upon being defeated rather than fading normally like other human enemies, using a special powder that dissolves them into sand. This will apply even if they are drowned or ragdolled.

===Etymology===
* The name ''Eremite'' is likely derived from the Ancient Greek word {{Lang|mini=1|grc=ἐρημίτης|grc_rm=erēmítēs}}, meaning "of the desert."
** The Ancient Greek word is also the origin of the English words ''{{wt|eremite||English}}'' and ''{{w|hermit}}'', both of which originally referred to those who secluded themselves in the desert for spiritual enlightenment.
* Its Chinese name, {{zh|镀金旅团}}, uses the phrase {{zh|{{wt|鍍金|镀金|Chinese}}}}, which literally means "gilded" or "gold-plated" but figuratively means making something ordinary appear special.
** As a metaphor, the phrase has a pejorative connotation and refers to people who go leave for other places to polish their qualifications despite lacking the actual skills.
