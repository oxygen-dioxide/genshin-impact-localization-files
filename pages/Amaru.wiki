'''Amaru''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|The Frozen, Rekindling Land}}. 

It is a [[Secret Source Servant]] that takes its name from the master it once served, "Almighty Amaru, the Hallowed Lord." After its master gave his life to protect the Celestial Axis in the war between [[Xiuhcoatl]] and [[Xbalanque]], "Amaru" was assigned to take up his mantle.
