|description  = A special plant that was produced via the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]].<br />With the awakening of the Sangacorexes, the elemental energies within [[Enkanomiya]] have been pacified. This is a naturally-growing fertilizing crop that will turn into loam within the soil once it decays.

'''Tokoyo Legumes''' are event items for the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]] [[event]]. When approaching a Tokoyo Legume
while equipping a [[Bokuso Box]] that still contains energy, it will appear and can then be gathered normally. Once the Bokuso Box is upgraded to Level 1, their locations are marked on the minimap, like how a [[Local Specialties#Character Bonuses|Local Specialty Utility Passive]] would.

It is used alongside [[Aphotium Ore]] to unseal the [[Teleport Waypoints]] throughout the map of [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]].
