|text      = I heard that in Natlan, there's a plant that bears enormous fruit! A few days ago, a traveling merchant came to Mondstadt, and I finally got my hands on this fascinating experiments material! Sadly, my vacation arrived faster than the results...

I want to pack some materials and test tubes to continue my research in the wild, but I'm worried that when I'm outside the lab, many uncontrollable factors can come into play and... any mishap might just turn into a huge disaster.

Could I ask you to join me and help keep an eye on the cauldron?

You're also welcome to take a look at what I've achieved so far. Please trust me, a tenfold yield in size should be within reach very soon!
