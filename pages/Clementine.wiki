'''Clementine''' is a mentioned character in ''Genshin Impact''. She is [[Callas]]' wife and [[Navia]]'s mother.

==Profile==
Clementine is the wife of the former president of [[Spina di Rosula]], Callas. She also served as a mediator in the organization, handling disputes between members. There was once a major internal dispute in Spina di Rosula in which Clementine sided with Callas, who wished to invest funds in the construction of Fontaine's [[aquabus]] lines, while [[Romeuf]] and his faction wanted to improve Poisson. Because she had sided with Callas and was pregnant with his child, however, Romeuf's faction felt she had betrayed her role as a mediator and left Spina di Rosula.<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Quest|page=Braving the Tides Together}}</ref>

Since Spina di Rosula ultimately ended up sponsoring the construction of the aquabus lines, the Clementine line is named after her.<ref name=":0" />

Clementine passed away before the events of the game due to complications during the birth of her daughter, Navia &mdash; a secret Callas had chose to keep from Navia, which frustrated Navia once she found out.
