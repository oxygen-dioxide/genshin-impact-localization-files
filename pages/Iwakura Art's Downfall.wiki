==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Katayama Tatsumi)
:'''Iwakura Art: Katayama Tatsumi:''' This shall be called the "Duel on Snake Mountain".
:;(Upon defeat)
:'''Iwakura Art: Katayama Tatsumi:''' Wonderful... Such a swift blade...

;(Approach Shimada Shichirouji)
:'''Iwakura Art: Shimada Shichirouji:''' The dishonor you brought upon our master shall be cleansed by your blood!
:;(Upon defeat)
:'''Iwakura Art: Shimada Shichirouji:''' Iwakura Art shall not be defeated...

;(Approach Okazaki Kunihiko)
:'''Iwakura Art: Okazaki Kunihiko:''' An outlander? A good chance to test my sword.
:;(Upon defeat)
:'''Iwakura Art: Okazaki Kunihiko:''' Brother...

;(Approach Mifune Satoshi)
:'''Iwakura Art: Mifune Satoshi:''' Are we pursued by the [[Inazuma Shogunate|Shogunate]]'s lackeys, even here?
:;(Upon defeat)
:'''Iwakura Art: Mifune Satoshi:''' Haha... Hah... Like whistling in the wind...

;(Approach Tanba Tetsuo)

;(Talk to Iwakura Mitsunari after defeating all disciples and acting instructors)
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Why did I leave the dojo to become Lord Kujou's instructor...
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Yanagiha and Okazaki as well as Mifune... why did they all leave me...
:{{DIcon}} I've encountered the disciples of the Iwakura Art.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Is that so...
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Are there people that still claim to be from Iwakura? Their Master was such an incompetent soul, after all.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' I am Iwakura Mitsunari. You could consider me a sword instructor here. And who might you be?
:{{DIcon}} I'm '''(Traveler)'''.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Mifune, Tanba... did you see them? The Okazaki brothers, too?
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Ah, yes, there's also Katayama. He always loved coming up with names for duels before they started.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' He'd say, "If I become a real master swordsman in the future, then all these duels can written into stories." Hahaha, such nonsense...
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Right, and we mustn't forget Shimada, who spent the entire "Eiin" and "Kouin" eras training, yet could never advance beyond the rank of Shoden.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' They fled and became bandits because they could not fathom the power of the Almighty Shogun's Vision Hunt Decree.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' I miss the good old days of teaching them how to wield a sword. Why in the world did I shut the dojo down and join the army?
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' (Traveler), how're their abilities?
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry to say this, but...
:{{DIcon}} I learned quite a bit.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Really...
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Then, (Traveler), who is your master? Is it Domon? Or Shousen? Or perhaps Narukami herself?
:{{DIcon}} I think I might be considered "self-taught."
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' I see.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' It seems like the Iwakura Art has waned under my watch. None of my students were able to defeat a self-learned swordsman.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Is that so? I understand.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Whatever your school of swordsmanship is, it doesn't matter.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' It seems like the Iwakura Art has waned under my watch. None of my students were able to defeat someone who is unwilling to reveal the name of their school.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' I truly am an incompetent Master of the Iwakura Art. As a swordsman, they call me Iwakura Kouin.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Although I have forgotten the key to our secret blade technique and my Vision was surrendered to the Almighty Shogun...
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' ...If you asked me if I still wish to avenge those disciples of mine who could not bear to see my degradation and wound up pursuing the path of wicked ghosts...
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' ...Yet who were incompetent and lost to you, then I do still have some of that fire within me.
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' This space is too small. It would be no place for even you to show off your swordsmanship. Come, follow me down.
;(Combat starts)
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Kouin of the Iwakura Art. I have come to seek your teaching.
;(Upon defeating Iwakura Mitsunari)
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Our clan's name... shall pass on no longer...
