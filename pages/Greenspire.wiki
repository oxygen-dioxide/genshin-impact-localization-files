|description    = A tall arbor with unique crown that resembles leaping verdant flame.<br />It is said that [[Yoimiya|the Queen of the Summer Festival]] herself received inspiration upon hearing how the children described this plant, working on light green fireworks. Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but the ore that can be found near this species can be ground down to make verdant flames rocket into the sky.
