'''Gadgets''' are utility items that can be used by the player for various purposes. It is the sixth tab in the [[Inventory]].

Some gadgets can be equipped into the Quick-Use slot, allowing them to be repeatedly used with ease, while others can only be used or placed from the inventory.

Non-consumable gadgets have a cooldown after they are used.

These Instructions and Diagrams can be obtained from increasing the [[Reputation]] level in various nations and the [[Frostbearing Tree's Gratitude]].
