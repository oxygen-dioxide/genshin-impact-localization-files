==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Aether's hair is braided. He wears a dark brown breastplate vest with gold and black accents baring his midriff and adorned with a diamond ornament, a white scarf clamped with a gold clip, and a white two-tailed cape lined with golden embroidery and a single golden guard with a ''{{w|fleur-de-lis}}'' pattern over his left shoulder. He wears dark hakama-like pants, dark brown gloves and black boots with kneecap guards accented with gold.

Lumine wears a sleeveless, backless, box pleated white dress held up by crossed black straps. She wears a long two-tailed scarf, with each tail having a gold, flat diamond-shaped ornament attached to the tip of the tail. Her legwear consists of angled thigh-high stockings and white ankle-high boots.

<!-- this section is transcluded in multiple places unrelated to his outfit, so please take care with the wording --><section begin="Glowing Ornaments" />While wearing {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|Rising Star||their default outfit,&nbsp;}}[[Rising Star]], when the Traveler's Elemental Burst is ready, various parts of their outfit will glow the way other characters' non-Vision gems glow along with their Visions. On Aether, these parts are his chest plate, the wrist joints of his gauntlets, arrow shaped areas on his kneecap guards, two diamonds attached one to each half of his cape, two accents in his shoulder guard and two orbs, one hanging off the end of his scarf, the other in his earring. On Lumine, the glowing parts are her chest plate, the wrist joints of her gauntlets, the diamond at the top of each of her boots, an oval on her waist at the back of her dress, the diamond at the end of each tail on her scarf, and the stem in each [[Inteyvat]] flower in her hair.<section end="Glowing Ornaments" /> These parts can also change color based on the element (or lack thereof) that the player's Traveler is currently resonating with, and they glowed white during the twins' fight against the [[unknown god]].
