'''Elemental Resonance''' are effects corresponding to the Elemental Types of [[Characters]] present in the [[Party]].

==Effects==
When there are certain combinations of elemental characters in the party, the whole party will receive a bonus. These bonuses stack, and apply in [[Co-Op Mode]]. Even if a character involved in Elemental Resonance is incapacitated, the Elemental Resonance Effect will still apply.
