'''Elemental Resonance''' are additional effects corresponding to the Elemental Types of [[Character]]s present in the full [[Party]].

==Effects==
While the party has four or more characters, the whole party will receive a bonus, which is based on elements of the first four party members, apply in [[Co-Op Mode]], and does not require all party members to be alive.

Except for Protective Canopy, each Resonance requires two or more characters of the same element in the first four party slots. Having more than two characters of the same element does not further enhance the corresponding Resonance.

When using Co-Op mode, if part of the party are inside a [[Domain]], the resonance will only be determined by the characters that are in the Domain, and only characters in the Domain will benefit from the bonuses.
