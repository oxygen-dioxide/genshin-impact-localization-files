'''Cloud Retainer's Abode''' is a [[Quest Domain]] during [[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter I]]: Act I - [[Of the Land Amidst Monoliths]] quest "[[Custodian of Clouds]]," as well as the [[World Quest]] "[[An Adeptal Summons]]."

Approaching the domain's entrance outside of the two quests will instead grant the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue start}}
:(The abode of [[Cloud Retainer]]. This adeptus seems unwilling to receive guests...)
{{Dialogue end}}

==Notes==
* To complete this domain normally, a [[Pyro]] user is needed to activate the Pyro Monuments in this domain.
* [[Traveler (Geo)]] can be used to skip the puzzles (and chests) by using [[Starfell Sword]] to climb up to the top of the tree on the starting island and gliding to the center platform.
* If you have [[Venti]], you can use Skyward Sonnet to glide to the middle platform, effectively skipping all the puzzles.
* If you have [[Keqing]], you can use Stellar Restoration to blink partway to the middle platform and glide down.
* The recommended party level scales with world level. For WL3, the recommended party level is 45.

==Puzzles==
# Use a Pyro attack to activate the Pyro Monument and start the challenge.
#* Defeat 10 Electro Slimes within the given time.
# Use the device on this platform to rotate the bridges and move to the next platform.
# On the next platform, fight some Hilichurls to unlock the 2nd device.
# Use the 2nd device to rotate the bridges until you can go forward and turn left to the platform with 5 fire totems.
# Use the 3rd device on this platform to start the challenge.
#* Watch 3 fire totems activate temporarily and use Pyro attacks to activate the totems in the same order. This unlocks a Common Chest.
# Repeat the challenge and activate 4 fire totems in the same order within 60 seconds to unlock an Exquisite Chest.
# Repeat the challenge and activate 5 fire totems in the same order within 75 seconds to unlock a Precious Chest.
# Return to the 2nd device and rotate the bridges until you can go forward and turn right to a broken circular platform. There's a Common Chest here.
# Use the wind current to glide up to the next platform with the 4th device. If you skipped the fire totem platform earlier, there won't be a wind current here.
# Use the 4th device to rotate the bridges until you can go forward to another platform with 6 fire totems. Half of the totems are activated.
# Use Pyro attacks to activate all 6 totems to unlock an Exquisite Chest and the 5th device. When a totem's activation status is changed, it also changes the activation status of the two totems to the left and right of it (e.g., If 3 totems are arranged in an "activated", "deactivated", "deactivated" pattern, activating the second one deactivates the 1st and activates the 3rd. Other totems are not affected.) Pay attention to the pattern.
# Use the 5th device to rotate the bridges until you can go forward to the final platform. A cut scene will start, revealing the Cloud Retainer. After the conversation, the domain will be completed.
