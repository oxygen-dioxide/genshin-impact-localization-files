The '''Crown of Insight''' is a [[Character Talent Material]] used when leveling [[Combat Talent]]s from base Level 9 to 10. One Crown of Insight, in addition to the usual Character Talent Materials, is required to upgrade one Combat Talent from base Level 9 to 10. Additional talent levels from [[Constellation]]s or [[Utility Passive]]s do not affect the base level nor upgrade cost.

Upgrading a [[Talent]] to base Level 10 is colloquially referred to as "crowning" a talent.

==How to Obtain==
Crown of Insight can be obtained through [[Offering System]]s or rewards from Limited Time [[Event]]s. A total of 32 Crowns of Insight have been obtainable since the launch of the game.

===Currently Obtainable===
11 Crowns of Insight are permanently obtainable through Offerings:
*1× from upgrading the [[Frostbearing Tree's Gratitude]] to Level 11.
*5× from upgrading the [[Sacred Sakura's Favor|Sacred Sakura]] to Levels 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45.
*1× from upgrading the [[Enhance the Lumenstone Adjuvant|Lumenstone Adjuvant]] to Level 4.
*4× from upgrading the [[Vanarana's Favor|Tree of Dreams]] to Levels 5, 15, 25, and 35.
