The '''Crown of Insight''' is a [[Talent Level-Up Material]] used when leveling [[Combat Talents]] from base Level 9 to 10. One Crown of Insight, in addition to the usual Talent Level-Up Materials, is required to upgrade one Combat Talent from base Level 9 to 10. Additional talent levels from [[Constellations]] or [[Utility Passive]]s do not affect the base level nor upgrade cost.

Upgrading a [[Talent]] to base Level 10 is colloquially referred to as "crowning" a talent.
