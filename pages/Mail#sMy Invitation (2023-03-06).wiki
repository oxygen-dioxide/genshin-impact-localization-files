|text    = Today is my birthday. I feel truly blessed to have my family and friends who have shown me care and support. As thanks, I hope you can honor me with your presence at my humble celebration. I await your visit.

Alright, I think that should do it for the formal invitation...

I checked carefully to make sure I got every word right.

Manners matter, no? Without them, these special occasions wouldn't be so special!

Back to the topic. How about I cook some homemade dishes for you today? This morning, I plucked some fresh and juicy [[radish]]es. These little radishes may not look like much, but they are rich in nutrition, easy to store, and can be made into various delicious dishes! I'll cook every kind of radish dish today for you to try them out and see if they are to your liking.

Oh, umm... I can't help but remind you: A healthy body is of utmost importance for any adventurer. So, no matter what obstacles or difficulties you might encounter in the future, always remember to eat your meals properly!
