==Trivia==
*Considering the Chinese name {{Lang|"Hook-Hook Fruit"|zh=钩钩果|zh_rm=Gōugōu-guǒ}}, the berry may have been inspired by {{Lang|the {{w|Harpagophytum|devil's claw}}|zh=钩果草|zh_rm=Gōuguǒ-cǎo|zh_lit=hook-fruit grass}}.
*A Wolfhook variant, the [[Red Wolfhook]], can be found during [[Barbara]]'s Hangout Event Act I: [[Wellspring of Healing]].
*[[Amber]]'s Alternate Outfit, [[100% Outrider]], is a "hook-proof" version of [[5-Star Outrider]], which was often torn by Wolfhooks while she was in the wild.
*The Traveler could choose to offer a Wolfhook as their Windblume of choice during [[Invitation of Windblume]].
