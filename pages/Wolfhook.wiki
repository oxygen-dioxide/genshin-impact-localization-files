==Descriptions==
{{Description|A berry with thorns that often gets attached to a wolf's pelt. When you look at it, you can almost hear the echoing cries of the wolves in the woods. Wolfhook has medicinal properties useful in treating minor illnesses. Although, in its original form, it can also harm careless people or animals...}}

==Trivia==
* Considering the Chinese name {{Lang|"Hook-Hook Fruit"|zh=钩钩果|zh_rm=Gōugōu-guǒ}}, the berry may have been inspired by {{Lang|the {{w|Harpagophytum|devil's claw}}|zh=钩果草|zh_rm=Gōuguǒ-cǎo|zh_lit=hook-fruit grass}}.
