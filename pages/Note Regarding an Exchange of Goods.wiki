...As per usual, our exchange will be carried out at the {{Color|help|withered tree behind the mountain}}, and on the subject of "Benben," the special object inquired about previously, the problem does seem to be related to an inability to self-circulate due to a lack of energy...<br>
...It just needs to be charged using energy obtained from Elemental Conversion, and its functions should return. As for a receptacle for that conversion and charging process, there is no need to worry. We can hand something over as part of the deal...<br>
