==Steps==
# Go to the worksite to ask around for news
# Ask [[Master Zhang]] about Wonder Cores
#* If Master Zhang has his normal dialogue, check the Quests window. Another quest nearby, such as [[Hereafter: The Trail of Pervases]], may be blocking progression.
# Go to the southwestern side of [[Mt. Tianheng]]
# Use {{Color|buzzword|[[Visions]]}} to find the [[Starsplinter Iron]] (0/2)
#* With the exceptions of [[Venti]] and [[Zhongli]], characters' Visions glow bright yellow and emit noise when near a Starsplinter Iron.
#** This includes [[Aloy]] who got a strange Vision despite being an outlander.
#* Nothing happens on characters who do not have a Vision on them ([[Traveler]] and [[Raiden Shogun]]).
#* One can be found in a straw hut in the south, and another can be found at the top of a rock pillar north of the straw hut.
# Ask the [[Mingjun|old man]] for information about Subrosium
# Search for records left behind in the village
#* Obtain [[Records of a Changing Village]] (near a [[Seelie]] court) and [[Ragged Notebook (Bygones Times Like Dust Passing)|Ragged Notebook]] (inside the hut closest to the Seelie court).
# Continue searching for record concerning ore
#* Obtain [[Mountainous Miscellany]] (inside a hut behind the hut with the Ragged Notebook)
# Talk to [[Shenhe]]
# Go to the middle of the lake
# Wait until evening (around 17:30)
#*If the quest does not proceed with a cut scene after waiting, check your Quests window. It could be locked by another quest, such as [[Hereafter: The Trail of Pervases]].
# Look for [[Subrosium]]
# Give the two types of ore you found to Master Zhang

==Notes==
* Completing the step ''Search for records left behind in the village'' will grant the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[A Former Dream]]."

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Only two materials left to find. Time to ask around at the worksite.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
----
;(If you talk to Changfeng at the partially-constructed Jade Chamber)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 changfeng 02.ogg}} '''Changfeng:''' The Jade Chamber belongs in the sky amongst the clouds!

;(If you talk to Leming at the partially-constructed Jade Chamber)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 leming 02.ogg}} '''Leming:''' The next step is to build the pavilions on the upper layer while we wait for the Wonder Cores and the Adepti Sigils.

;(If you talk to Lizheng near the construction crane)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 lizheng 02.ogg}} '''Lizheng:''' The basic structure is beginning to take shape, but there is still a lot of work to do... Get back to it.

;(If you talk to Anshun near the wooden boxes)<!--same as in [[Seagaze Sunset]]-->
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 anshun 02.ogg}} '''Anshun:''' I heard that Lady Keqing has gone to Guyun Stone Forest.

;(If you talk to Siqin who is standing guard)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 siqin 02.ogg}} '''Siqin:''' We're halfway there. I must keep my wits about me and continue to ensure the safety of the site for the remainder of the project!

;(If you talk to Liang who is standing guard)<!--same as in [[Seagaze Sunset]]-->
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 bright 03.ogg}} '''Liang:''' I heard a good few of my comrades have been sent over to Guyun Stone Forest. I sure hope they'll be safe out there...
{{Transclude|Seagaze Sunset|Keqing|section=1}}<!--same as in [[Seagaze Sunset]]-->

;(If you talk to Qiqi next to the [[Liyue Harbor#South Wharf|Liyue Harbor Dockyard]] entrance)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 qiqi 01.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Oh, it's you.
:{{DIcon}} Qiqi! What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 qiqi 02.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Seaside. Dangerous.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 qiqi 03.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Qiqi is helping. With the evacuation.
:{{DIcon}} "Dangerous"?
:{{DIcon}} "Evacuation"?
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 qiqi 04.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Yes. Ningguang said there's [[Beisht|something bad in the sea]].
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 qiqi 05.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' So she sent Qiqi, to evacuate everyone.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 qiqi 06.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' But, no one will listen to Qiqi. So instead, Qiqi is guarding this place.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 qiqi 07.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' If danger comes, Qiqi will protect everyone.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 qiqi 08.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Don't go near the sea. It's too dangerous.

;(If you visit Guyun Stone Forest)<!--can this dialogue be triggered before talking to Qiqi?-->
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' The zombie called Qiqi is right. A great wrath brews in the sea.
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I don't know where this wrath comes from. So let's keep our distance for the time being.

----
;(Approach the worksite)
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, look, (Traveler)! The Jade Chamber is floating into the sky!
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But it seems to be tied down by something...
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 baiwen 01.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' That's because it's not finished.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Baiwen! And hey [[Beidou]]! And hey, um... person Paimon doesn't know...
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 baiwen 02.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Given the enormous scale of the Jade Chamber, we split the construction work into two phases to make sure the structure remains balanced.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 baiwen 03.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Before we find some suitable Plaustrite, we build the Jade Chamber's keel at ground level.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 baiwen 04.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Once the Plaustrite is ready, we place it into the keel and let the partially-constructed Jade Chamber rise up to the height of the surrounding mountain peaks.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 baiwen 05.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' The remainder of the construction work is then carried out at that altitude. Once everything is ready, we release the iron tethers and allow the Jade Chamber to rise to its target altitude.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 changgui 01.ogg}} '''Changgui:''' Miss Baiwen, we've brought some new materials to submit&mdash;
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 baiwen 06.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' One moment. I'll be right there.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 baiwen 07.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' The construction work has only been able to progress this rapidly thanks to the Plaustrite provided by you. Lady Ningguang is most grateful and looks forward to seeing more of your work.
;(Baiwen leaves)
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Wow! Can't believe you sourced the Plaustrite so quickly &mdash; it's the key piece of the puzzle. Looks like you beat us to the punch.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Beidou... you're joining the Jade Chamber contest too?
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Sure am. I happened to get my hands on a chunk of Sunset Vermillionite on a voyage a while back, so I figured I'd bring it over.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so even though it's rare, we're not the only ones who managed to get hold of it...
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Oh, I've got some introductions to do: This is the renowned Ms. Yun, or [[Yun Jin]], probably the most famous figure in the Liyue opera scene.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Greetings.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' These two are Paimon and the Traveler, both good buddies of mine, and this is... Um, sorry, I'm not sure we've met...
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' [[Shenhe]]. I am their... friend.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hahaha... Good to meet ya! A friend of a friend is my friend too &mdash; or as I like to say, a mate of a crewmate is part of the crew!
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Ms. Yun is also here for the contest. Turned out she needed to borrow a boat, so we came together.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' It's an honor to finally meet you both. I've heard much about you. Ms. Shenhe, though we are only meeting for the first time, I have a feeling that we will get along very well indeed.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' To be honest with you all, I am in great need of this opportunity to ask Lady Ningguang a question. That's why I joined the contest. Thanks to my father's connections, I was able to acquire a specimen of the Plaustrite required. Fortunately, it was approved for submission, despite being a little on the diminutive side.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... So it looks like the three of us are competitors now!
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Excuse me for prying, Ms. Shenhe, but... are you competing as well?
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 shenhe 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo shlq003 1 shenhe 02b.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' No. I don't have any questions for Ningguang. I just wanted to help (Traveler) win.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' In that case... I have a proposal to make.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 06.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Lady Ningguang said that the first three contestants to procure all three materials will be awarded the chance to ask a question. Well, there are three teams here. We can split the prize between us.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 07.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Instead of competing against each other, we could work together to secure the top three places between us. What do you think?
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds great! But how does that change things, exactly?
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Haha... I think I see where you're going with this, Ms. Yun.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' The Plaustrite was the most difficult item to source by a long shot. Luckily, all three of us managed to get our hands on it. The two remaining items aren't quite so rare, so as long as one of us finds a way to source it, the other two can hop on the bandwagon.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' How'd I do? Is that what you had in mind?
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 08.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Precisely.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Huh. Interesting approach.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Okay then! Alright, I'll go first. I have some leads on these "Wonder Cores."
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 11.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' From what I've heard, the core itself is really not that difficult to make. The hard part is getting hold of the ore used as raw materials. I'm gonna head back to the ship and ask [[Suling]] if he's heard of them, you guys&mdash;
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 09.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' We will head into town and seek advice from [[Master Zhang]] of [[Hanfeng's Ironmongers]]. Thoughts, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds good. Let's go.
:{{DIcon}} You can trust Master Zhang's smithing skills.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 12.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Wonderful. We'll split into teams then, and whoever makes progress first brings all of us a step closer to victory.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 beidou 13.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'm gonna take off &mdash; see you later!
;(Beidou leaves)
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay. Let's go.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, what question are you gonna ask Ningguang, Yun Jin?
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 10.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I'm looking for a venue to host the performance of our new opera. Lady Ningguang has excellent judgment, so I would like to hear her opinion.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... What's the opera called? Paimon wants to go see it!
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 11.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' The opera is a labor of love by my father. He wrote it based on a popular urban legend about an evil spirit and an adeptus.
:{{A|vo shlq003 1 yunjin 12.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' It's called "[[The Divine Damsel of Devastation]]."

{{Quest Description|update|You meet Yun Jin rather by chance. She suggests looking for Master Zhang and asking him some questions.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Master Zhang)
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 01.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' Hmm? Ah, hello. Are you here for something off-the-shelf? Or do you need something forged?
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Excuse me, Master Zhang, we were wondering if you'd heard of something called a "Wonder Core."
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 02.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' Of course I have. Sorry, um... who's asking?
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' My name is Yun Jin. Perhaps you don't know me, but I believe that you've forged some weaponry for my father in the past, for stage use.
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 03.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' Yun Jin? Stage use? ...Oh! So... you must be Ms. Yun?
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 04.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' Ahem, sorry, my brain's finally caught up! It's not used to doing much beyond bashing a hammer all day... Everyone's heard of you, Ms. Yun! Even folks who don't make it to the opera all that often, like myself.
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 05.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' So. You're here to ask about Wonder Cores, huh? As it happens, I do know how to make them. Matter of fact, I made some for Lady Ningguang back when she was building the original Jade Chamber.
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 06.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' The types of ore needed to make Wonder Cores are a little hard to come by. Lady Ningguang supplied them herself last time &mdash; I don't suppose you've brought any yourselves?
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No... We were gonna ask you what kinds of ore we need!
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 07.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' Sure. Well, you'll need two kinds: [[Starsplinter Iron]] and [[Subrosium]].
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 08.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' If I remember correctly, Lady Ningguang sourced her Starsplinter Iron from the [[Mt. Tianheng]] area. They say it {{Color|buzzword|resonates with Visions.}}
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 09.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' It could take some work, but if you stick with it, you'll find some eventually. As for the Subrosium, though... that's trickier. It's all but unheard of on the market...
:{{DIcon}} Then... where do we start?
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 10.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' Uh... I'm really not sure, sorry. What I've heard is that the people around Mt. Tianheng have some sort of magic trick that can pinpoint the location of the stuff.
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 masterzhang 11.ogg}} '''Master Zhang:''' Of course, it's probably just hearsay. If you want my advice, start by looking for Starsplinter Iron around Mt. Tianheng, and if you run into any locals, ask them a few questions about Subrosium.
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Mt. Tianheng...
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Interestingly enough, the story of "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" also takes place on that mountain.
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I hear the view there is quite spectacular. A favorite destination of the adepti, in fact.
:{{A|vo shlq003 3 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Perhaps it can give me some inspiration. Let's not delay, we should head straight there.
{{Dialogue end}}

{{Quest Description|update|According to Master Zhang, Starsplinter Iron may be found in places where Visions shine brightly. As for Subrosium, you'll have better luck asking the locals...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the marked spot)
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I came to Mt. Tianheng once with my father as a child. I remember it being such a long climb that I could barely feel my legs by the time we reached the top.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' This is quite a trip down memory lane for me... Look at these majestic towering peaks and the gently flowing streams. It's like setting foot in paradise.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' No wonder the legend of "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" is said to have taken place here. "Adepti wander oft where mortals seldom stride." Indeed, this looks like a place that one might expect to be frequented by adepti.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" is your upcoming opera, right? And the story takes place in Mt. Tianheng, huh... Seems like you have a real connection with this place!
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the story about, though?
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' It's... the story of a girl becoming a hero.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool, a hero story! They're Paimon's favorite!
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' The legend first arose in this area. It is said that there used to be a prosperous village on the mountain.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 06.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' In that village, there was a loving couple who were completely devoted to one another. One day, a terrifying monster appeared.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 07.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' The wife was out collecting herbs and was captured by the monster. Her husband was so distraught at the news that it broke his spirit, and drove him to madness.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 08.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' The vile and vicious monster told the villagers, "If you want to live, you must sacrifice a child to me!"
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a nasty piece of work! Ugh! Paimon sure hopes this monster gets put in its place!
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 09.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' But the monster was so terrible and so strong that all within the village were terrified of it. They had no choice but to give in to the monster's demand.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 10.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Just while they were discussing whose child would be given over to the monster, a little girl suddenly stood up and came forward.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No! Don't do it, little girl!
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 11.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Unbeknownst to anybody else, she was concealing an exorcist's blade. She approached the monster's lair, feigning fear and trepidation... When she finally arrived, she courageously drew her sword and entered into a fierce struggle with the monster, from which she eventually emerged as the victor.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 12.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Her extraordinary abilities drew the attention of the adepti, and they took her as one of their own. Her story became the stuff of legends... But alas, the paths of mortals and adepti seldom cross, and she would never again re-enter the mortal world.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 13.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' "And so, destined to grace the mortal realm for but a brief moment, she vanished like a wisp of smoke into thin air." That's how the opera ends.
:{{DIcon}} (Look at Shenhe.)
:{{DIcon}} (Remain silent.)
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I really like this story.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' But I personally think that perhaps the little girl was... not as brave as the opera makes her out to be.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I'm not sure she deserves all the praise she is given.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 14.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I've never considered that before.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 15.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Opera is always an interpretation of the events it purports to portray. A certain degree of deviation from the truth is always inevitable.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 16.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' When my father wrote the script for this play, I suppose his intention was to inspire his audience with the character of the divine damsel.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Mm. I think it's a great story. The ideal story.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... it sure inspired Paimon! Let's go get ourselves some Starsplinter Iron! Yeah!

;(After collecting the Starsplinter Iron)
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This should be enough Starsplinter Iron. Now we just need to find that "Subrosium"...
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 17.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I think I saw a village on our way here.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 18.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Master Zhang said we should ask the locals for help. Why don't we try there?

:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, there really is someone here!
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yun Jin, looks like you were right. Excuse us, Sir! Can we ask you something?
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 mingjun 01.ogg}} '''Villager:''' ...
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, he didn't seem to catch that, (Traveler)...
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 19.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Hello, Sir. We were just passing by and wanted to ask if you happened to know anything about Subrosium.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 mingjun 02.ogg}} '''Villager:''' ...
;(The villager points with his finger)
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is he tryna tell us to look for clues in the village...? Well, whatever. Guess we're on our own here.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shenhe, Yun Jin, (Traveler), let's have a look around!
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Sorry, you can go ahead without me. I'd like to have a word with this gentleman.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' If that's okay with you... Uncle [[Mingjun]]?
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 mingjun 03.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' It's... it's...!
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Shenhe.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 mingjun 04.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' Shenhe... You're alive? The rumors were true? So, all these years...
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 mingjun 05.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' I'm sorry, I don't know how to find Subrosium. But I think you can find some information in the village...
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 mingjun 06.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' This place is deserted now. No one ever comes here. So you can rummage around all you want.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You know this guy, Shenhe?
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 20.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Thank you, kind sir. We'll go and take a look around.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 yunjin 21.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Don't worry. Mingjun has no ill intention towards Ms. Shenhe. She'll be quite safe.
:{{A|vo shlq003 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay. Then let's see what we can find in this village.

;(Talk to Mingjun or Shenhe)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I came back here once before, a few years ago. Alone. I hid it from Master at the time.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' It was deserted then, too, except for a few low-life bandits. Everyone and everything I remembered was long gone. But as people were passing by, they stopped to admire me... they praised me, telling me I gave off the aura of an adeptus.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I tried explaining to them that I wasn't an adeptus, just an ordinary person who came from this village. But no one believed me.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' When I saw how run-down all these houses were, I felt at a loss. It was like I took a look at the world and, on the surface, it looked like a vast realm with so many places I could go. Then I looked a little closer. And there was nowhere for me to go at all.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 mingjun 01.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' Suddenly, so much time has gone by, and everything has changed.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Last time I visited, I felt so upset. But today... I don't know why, but it feels different.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 mingjun 02.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' It is easy for your mind to run wild when you are alone. But this time, you are with your friends, aren't you?
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Yes, my... my friends.

;(Pick up the Ragged Notebook)
{{color|menu|You found a ragged notebook in the village. It records the sad story of a father who sought to revive his wife by sacrificing his daughter Shenhe.}}
:;(Opens [[Ragged Notebook (Bygones Times Like Dust Passing)|Ragged Notebook]])
::The doctor said you were gravely ill. Don't worry. I will give everything I have to save you.<br /><br />My heart bleeds whenever I see you getting wearier, your illness beyond treatment. How I wish I could suffer the pain for you...<br /><br />You said you had no regrets in this life and that you only wish for me to take good care of Shenhe. But you regret nothing, why the tears?<br /><br />I don't know what I've been doing lately. Though I still breathe, I feel like an empty shell. I have read all the ancient texts I could get my hands on, looking for ways to save you — but it is utterly futile.<br /><br />I finally found it! It was Mingjun! He had kept the book that could save you hidden! I took it and followed its instructions to summon a god and offer a sacrifice...<br /><br />The god appeared. I told him that I was willing to exchange my life for yours. He kept silent and only pointed at our daughter, Shenhe.<br /><br />The god said her fate was to bear the curse of calamity and that she was prone to bring harm to those close to her. The god also said that she might even have been the cause of your death. In that case, I thought I should...<br /><br />I left her in the cave that the god mentioned. Three days have passed, and still, no news. I grow restless from waiting, seized by an ominous feeling...<br /><br />I am sorry, my love. Forgive me! You too, Shenhe — please, forgive me! How stupid I was! How blind! Let me apologize to both of you... in person.
;(Dialogue is the same regardless of whether "Ragged Notebook" is picked up first or second)
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' What's this...?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe this is the true story of "The Divine Damsel of Devastation."
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' So... Shenhe is the divine damsel?
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Now that I think about it, she does behave rather like an adeptus, and she is about the right age...
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' So that's why I've been getting the strangest feeling whenever I chat with her. I should've noticed it earlier.
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' According to this text, the "divine damsel" from the opera was actually the daughter of the loving couple.
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 06.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' And... she didn't volunteer. She was... sacrificed to the monster. By her own father.
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 07.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' ...
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 08.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' The truth is even more lamentable than the opera. Now I understand why Shenhe said the girl was not as brave as people think... It wasn't her choice to enter that ghastly situation. She was forced into it.
:{{A|vo shlq003 5 yunjin 09.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' It looks like my father may need to make a few revisions to his beloved opera...

{{color|menu|You found a migration record in the village, which records how a family was shattered and the village was forced to relocate }}
:;(Opens [[Records of a Changing Village]])
::A branch family of exorcists used to live in the east of the village, but in around two weeks, the mother died of disease, the young daughter went missing, and shortly after, the father hanged himself on a tree in the yard of his own house.<br /><br />It has been confirmed that traces of an evil god's remains were found in the village.<br /><br />The villagers are panicking as no one is certain whether the evil god's remains are gone for good.<br /><br />Do be careful when you are in this area.
;(If the player picked up "Records of a Changing Village" first)
::{{A|vo shlq003 6 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' The remains of a god... an abandoned village... Mt. Tianheng...
::{{A|vo shlq003 6 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Does this mean that the true story of "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" happened right here, in this village?
::{{A|vo shlq003 6 yunjin 06.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' The time frame certainly matches, so it seems we're in the right area. Let's keep looking around.
;(If the player picked up "Records of a Changing Village" second)
::{{A|vo shlq003 6 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' So it seems that Shenhe's father thought he was summoning a benevolent deity using a magic incantation, but in fact he summoned an evil god's remains, which took the form of a monster.
::{{A|vo shlq003 6 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' His obsessive yearning for his deceased wife led to a terrible tragedy, the villagers moved away in fear without ever learning the truth... and now this place is deserted.
::{{A|vo shlq003 6 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Still, I do wonder what the connection is between Shenhe and Mingjun.

;(After reading Ragged Notebook and Records of a Changing Village)
:{{A|vo shlq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, we've looked everywhere but still no mention of Subrosium.
:{{A|vo shlq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's have a look over there!

;(Pick up the third scroll)
{{color|menu|you found a text named "Mountainous Miscelleny", which records the method to find subrosium.}}
:;(Opens [[Mountainous Miscellany]])
::Magic engraved on Subrosium does not wear off easily. Some believe the stone to be a bridge between the living and the dead.<br /><br />However finding Subrosium is no easy matter. You need to be at the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Legend has it that you may find Subrosium if you stand in the middle of the lake south of Mt. Tianheng at {{Color|buzzword|dusk}} and look in the direction of {{Color|buzzword|the setting sun}}.
:{{A|vo shlq003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is it!
:{{A|vo shlq003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So basically, we need to go to the {{Color|buzzword|middle of the lake}} south of Mt. Tianheng at {{Color|buzzword|dusk}}, and we'll find us some Subrosium.
:{{A|vo shlq003 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go back and tell Shenhe the news.
;(Obtain [[Mountainous Miscellany]])

;(Approach Mingjun and Shenhe)
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 mingjun 01.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' One year when I was back visiting, I heard a story about a white-haired adeptus from a merchant passing by. I never imagined it was you.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 mingjun 02.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' I was a very close friend of your father's. I could have stopped him from performing the summoning ritual &mdash; I had plenty of chances, but... I couldn't bring myself to stand up to him. I just let things happen, let it all escalate, and... Well, we all know how that story ended.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 mingjun 03.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' I bring flowers back here every year, and each time I wish I had a chance to apologize to you.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Apologize for what? If you'd stopped him, he'd only have found another way.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' There is nothing he wouldn't have done for his true love. Nothing.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 mingjun 04.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' Do you still... hate him?
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I don't know what I feel. I'm told my fate is to bear the curse of calamity, so my master bound my soul with [[red ropes]] to curb my aggression. But it also dampened my emotions, making me dispassionate like the adepti.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' So if you ask me how I feel about the past, if I hate my father or not... The truth is, I feel nothing at all.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 mingjun 05.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' It must have been so tough for you all these years...
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shenhe, we're back!
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 mingjun 06.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' Oh, then I will leave you all in peace. Shenhe, it brings me some solace knowing that you are okay.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 mingjun 07.ogg}} '''Mingjun:''' I'll tell you more about the old times next time we meet.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, mister! We found some info in the end!
;(Mingjun leaves)
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shenhe, look! This tells us how to find Subrosium. All we gotta do is go to the middle of that lake!
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Hm? Let's go then.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' ...
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Ms. Shenhe, there's something I'd like to talk to you about.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Just now, in the village, we found your father's diary... It turns out that many of the details in "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" are not true to the facts. So I'd like to change them.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Why?
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I know I say that opera always deviates from the truth, but now that the main character is standing right here in front of me, I cannot simply dismiss your lived experience in favor of my father's fiction.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' It's okay. I like your version.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' My master once said that the day I learn how to use my strength for the good of others is the day that I can truly become part of human society.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 09.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' So I hope that one day, I might be brave enough to stand up and protect others, just like the girl in the opera.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 shenhe 10.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' But I've never thought this way before and I wonder whether I will continue to think in this way.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 yunjin 06.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Don't worry. I believe you will.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 yunjin 07.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' In fact, I think maybe you've already started to become the person you aspire to be. You just haven't had the opportunity to see it for yourself yet.
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shenhe, Yun Jin, cut the chit-chat! Let's go!
:{{A|vo shlq003 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can't let someone else beat us to it!

:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Ningguang didn't tell you?
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Something has happened in Guyun Stone Forest. According to the contract, as an adeptus, I should not get involved for now.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq003 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' But these things can be unpredictable. I have a contingency plan of my own.

:{{A|vo shlq003 10 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I ran into a bit of a brick wall on my end. Suling's never seen a Wonder Core before, and says it'd take a lot of research for him to get up to speed...

:{{A|vo shlq003 10 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Yes. I have been training with the adepti for years. I know a thing or two about making sigils.
:{{A|vo shlq003 10 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' When we first met, I told you I came for the Jade Chamber, not the contest.
:{{A|vo shlq003 10 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' In fact, I came specifically to deliver Adepti Sigils. Master heard that Ningguang was planning to rebuild the Jade Chamber, so she sent me to deliver some Adepti Sigils to her.
:{{A|vo shlq003 10 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Master also said she hoped that I can take this opportunity to rejoin human society. But now that I'm here, I wonder if I've been removed from the world for too long. There's so much basic knowledge that I lack.
:{{A|vo shlq003 10 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Maybe it won't work for me to stay here after all. But either way, I'm very glad to have met you, and I'll take care of those Adepti Sigils.
