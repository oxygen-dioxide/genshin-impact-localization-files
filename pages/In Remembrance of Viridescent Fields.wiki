{{Description|A wild flower that was once a ubiquitous sight in its homeland. It was picked by a hunter who wore it on their chest.}}
'''In Remembrance of Viridescent Fields''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Viridescent Venerer]].

==Description==
A white wild flower that used to cover the earth.<br />It has not withered one bit, and still gives off an exquisite fragrance.

In the days when wildlife still roamed the earth and monsters had not yet appeared,<br />the [[Viridescent|Viridescent Venerer]] would use this flower to conceal her human scent.<br />Thus it was said that to seek the silent and gentle Viridescent Venerer,<br />one simply need to close one's eyes and walk barefoot through the forest, following the subtle fragrance of wild flowers.<br />Only those who could tread as softly as a hunter could avoid making the leaves crackle underfoot, alerting the queen of hunters to their presence.

It was also said that the one who eventually found the hunter was a boy.<br />At that time, [[cataclysm|disaster]] had just befallen the [[Khaenri'ah|ancient kingdom]] and misery was spreading across the land.
