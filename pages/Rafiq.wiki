;(Daytime)
: {{DIcon|Idle}} Requires reinforcing...
:: {{A|VO Rafiq 01.ogg}} "Em-hm, some parts of the ship still require reinforcing."

;(Nighttime)
: {{DIcon|Idle}} Cabin capacity...
:: {{A|VO Rafiq 02.ogg}} "Huh, if only we can find a way to increase the cabin capacity."

;(Daytime)
:{{A|VO Rafiq All Schemes to Know 01.ogg}} '''Rafiq:''' (I wonder if there is any other suitable material for strengthening boat hulls?)

;(Nighttime)
:{{A|VO Rafiq All Schemes to Know 02.ogg}} '''Rafiq:''' (Qishan does know her way around boats... Maybe I should chat with her more in the future.)

==Dialogue==
=== Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Rafiq:''' Hi, need some commercial ship repairs done?
;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
::{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Rafiq:''' I'm a ship craftsman. I'm responsible for ship repairs and maintenance.
::'''Rafiq:''' When there's no work to do, I'll carry out new research on such questions as how to expand a ship's cabin capacity without compromising the structural integrity of the hull...
::'''Rafiq:''' But I'm no researcher after all. I don't have a lot of theoretical knowledge, no means to conduct experiments, and I have no friends who study in [[Kshahrewar]]...
::'''Rafiq:''' I've submitted a request to the [[Akasha Terminal]], but it seems to believe that I know enough already...
::'''Rafiq:''' With regards to my daily work alone, it is indeed enough. But I really want to make some new breakthroughs...
;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Rafiq:''' I'm the ship's craftsman. I'm responsible for ship repairs and maintenance.
::'''Rafiq:''' When there's no work to do, I'll carry out new research on such questions as how to expand a ship's cabin capacity without compromising the structural integrity of its hull...
::'''Rafiq:''' But in the end, I'm no researcher. I don't have a lot of theoretical knowledge, no means to conduct experiments, and I have no friends who study in Kshahrewar, and now that Akasha has been shut down...
::'''Rafiq:''' But Qishan says that this may not be a bad thing. Now that the Akasha Terminals are gone, she says, everyone is free to obtain whatever knowledge they desire.
::'''Rafiq:''' And you know what? I think she's got a point there!
:{{DIcon}} Not at the moment.
::'''Rafiq:''' Okay. Come find me if you do.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Rafiq:''' If only we could find a way to increase the cabin capacity...
:'''Qishan:''' Wouldn't that affect the ship's hull though?
:'''Qishan:''' At least, simply changing the material wouldn't cut it.
:'''Rafiq:''' But based on my calculations, if this cabin here could be opened up to the one next door...
:'''Rafiq:''' But you said that wouldn't work, so maybe it really isn't possible...
:'''Rafiq:''' Speaking of which, does everyone in [[Liyue]] know as much about ships as you do, [[Qishan]]?
:'''Qishan:''' Ahem... Not necessarily.
:'''Qishan:''' After all, we have people working in all sorts of industries in Liyue.
