The '''Fellflower''' is an event boss for the [[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms/Rise of the Fell Flower|Rise of the Fell Flower]] Challenge in Act II of the [[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]] [[Event]].

It is a [[Cryo Whopperflower]] created by [[Primordial Albedo]], using the alchemical notes he stole from Albedo and [[Durin]]'s blood; the mutations allow it to mimic humans, of which it attempted to impersonate [[Albedo]].

In the latter part of the story arc, he was referred to by Albedo as "'''Subject Three'''" in his story. "Subject One" is Rhinedottir's 'successful' Albedo; and "[[Primordial Albedo|Subject Two]]" is the Fellflower's creator, "Primordial" Albedo &mdash; the failed iteration of Rhinedottir to create human life.

* '''Type 1:''' Slams down at the player three times from above, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}.
* '''Type 2:''' Suspends in midair and launches homing projectiles at the player, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on hit.

==Strategy==
When first fought, the Fellflower is massive and comes with a shield that reduces damage it takes. While {{Pyro}} is effective against the shield, it is important to also destroy the '''Arcane Fruits''' spawned by the Fellflower to deal significant damage to its shield. When an Arcane Fruit is destroyed, 3 drops of '''Arcane Essence''' will spawn. It is necessary to pick up the Arcane Essence as failing to do so will result in the Fellflower absorbing them and regenerating its shield. Picking up the Arcane Essence will cause percentage-based DMG from the active character's health, which can also down them.

During the shielded phase, a [[Healing|healer]] is highly recommended, as Arcane Essence can deal a significant amount of true damage that ignores [[shields]] when picked up. A ranged character is also helpful for destroying the 2nd type of Arcane Fruits, which suspends in midair and is difficult to reach for melee characters.

When the shield depletes, the Fellflower shrinks to a much smaller size and becomes much more manageable, acting like a normal Whopperflower. The Fellflower will be invincible for a short period of time while transitioning to the second phase.

==Trivia==
*"Fell" is a word with various Old English to Proto-Germanic roots all roughly meaning "fierce", "wicked", "cruel", "savage". etc.
** Another possible root stems from Latin, where it can refer to "poison" or "venom" (in this case Durin's corruptive blood).
