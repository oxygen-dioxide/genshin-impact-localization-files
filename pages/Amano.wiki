:'''Amano:''' Hello, how can I help you?
;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:{{DIcon}} May I ask about the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]]?
::'''Amano:''' The fame of the Almighty Shogun spreads afar throughout the world. She keeps the eternal peace in Inazuma.
::'''Amano:''' About the [[Sakoku Decree]] though... No, never mind. I have no problem with that.
::'''Amano:''' Of course it's better that we have fewer outlanders to deal with. For the lucky few such as yourself who have come to Inazuma, you must follow the rules here.
