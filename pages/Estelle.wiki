==Profile==
Estelle is the blacksmith of Beaumont Workshop in Court of Fontaine and a former member of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. Unlike other blacksmiths who rely on hammer and muscle, she forges using advanced Fontainian machinery that makes up for her size and can "make the impossible, possible."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Semi-Automatic Forging}}</ref> Despite having the "Boss" title, it doesn't stop her from being harassed by [[Truand]], one of her customers.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Estelle:''' Hello there, what can I help you with?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy a weapon.
::'''Estelle:''' Take your pick &mdash; each one of our products is masterfully crafted.
:;(Opens [[#Shop|Shop]])
:{{DIcon|Forging}} I'd like something made.
:;(If nothing has been forged)
:::'''Estelle:''' Please give me the details, and I'll start operating the machine right away.
:;(If something has been forged but not collected yet)
:::'''Estelle:''' Your previous order is complete. Do you have any other requests?
:{{DIcon|!}} Tell me about Fontaine's mineral products.
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Estelle knows)
:::'''Estelle:''' You want to know about ore-producing areas nearby? Well, there are indeed some [[Condessence Crystal]]s around, and some hard [[Magical Crystal Ore]].
:::'''Estelle:''' I can't get my machine there to help you extract them, however. You're on your own, I'm afraid...
:::'''Estelle:''' There's no problem, you say? Okay, then. Allow me to mark the spot on your map. And remember, safety first while excavating!
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Estelle knows)
:::'''Estelle:''' The ore supplier was just here, and I heard from them that the nearby mines barely have anything left. I'm sorry. I'll let you know if I hear anything else.
:{{DIcon}} Is this machine used to forge weapons?
::'''Estelle:''' That's right. I'm very proud of this one, in fact.
::'''Estelle:''' After all, are machines not eminently suited to this energy-intensive work we call forging, being able to control strength and temperature precisely as they are?
::'''Estelle:''' Even someone with the most ordinary of physical qualities like me can make exquisite, honed weaponry, just like those muscled smiths.
;(Available after Step 4 of ''[[The City of Rains and Remembrance]]'')
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
::'''Estelle:''' Ah, you've finished delivering Magic Pockets with that [[Lyney|magician]], I see. Good work.
::'''Estelle:''' To be honest, I think he's influenced me a bit &mdash; I couldn't help but send some of my friends a couple of those pockets.
::'''Estelle:''' I was originally a renowned scientist working at the Fontaine Research Institute. By right, I shouldn't believe in such things.
::'''Estelle:''' But as they say, it never hurts to be prepared. A rigorous researcher should take all manner of possibilities into consideration.
;(Available after completing ''[[The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur]]'')
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
::'''Estelle:''' Ah, the flood. That magic pocket your magician friend provided proved very useful.
::'''Estelle:''' I wasn't a believer in the prophecy myself. But I put a lot of spare parts and tools inside, just in case.
::'''Estelle:''' And boy, am I glad I did. I'd never have found them all if the water had swept them away.
::'''Estelle:''' So it looks like you and your friends weren't affected too badly? Great, it's such a relief the prophecy crisis has finally passed.
:{{DIcon}} I don't need anything at the moment.
::'''Estelle:''' In that case, take care.
