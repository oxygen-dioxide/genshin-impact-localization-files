{{Quest Description|Pele Nui of the People of the Springs seems to have encountered some trouble...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Pele Nui)
:'''Pele Nui:''' Could you please come ashore, just for a bit? I need to clean up the springs over here.
:'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Roar...
:'''Pele Nui:''' Come on now, be a good boy! If not, I'm going to have to pick you up myself!
:'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Roar!
;(The [[Koholasaur Whelp]] will wander off back into the hot spring)
:'''Pele Nui:''' And he's gone in a flash, just like that. Ugh, how am I going to get a hold of him now...
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
:'''Pele Nui:''' Hmm? You here for a hot spring bath? Sorry, but I'm in the middle of cleaning this pool here, so you might have to wait a moment.
:'''Pele Nui:''' Also, this lunk won't come up and out no matter what I say. *sigh* And I've got so many more pools to clean, too.
:'''Pele Nui:''' Could he be throwing a tantrum because I carried him out a few days earlier? Seriously, what a pain...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe I can coax him out.
::'''Pele Nui:''' Well... Yeah, sure, why not? Maybe a change of pace is just what the doctor ordered, eh? Good luck, then.
::'''Pele Nui:''' Honestly, what's gotten into it? Before, I could just pat his {{Color|buzzword|head}} or {{Color|buzzword|tummy}}, and he'd just do what he was told...
:{{DIcon}} I can help you clean the other springs.
::'''Pele Nui:''' Would you really? That'd be great, because I'm pretty overwhelmed here.
::'''Pele Nui:''' In that case, uh, just start from that one over there.
::'''Pele Nui:''' I already scrubbed the bottom a few days back, so all you need to do is clear the junk floating on the surface.
::'''Pele Nui:''' I'm counting on you, then. I'll continue persuading this little fella.
::'''Pele Nui:''' *sigh* Honestly, what's gotten into him? Before, I could just pat his head or tummy, and he'd just do what he was told...

===Try communicating with the lazy little Koholasaurus===
;(Talk to Pele Nui again, optional)
:'''Pele Nui:''' *sigh* Why's he throwing a tantrum like this...

;(Talk to Lazy Koholasaurus)
:'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Hroo...? Rrroo, rroo...
:{{DIcon}} (Pat his head...)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Rroo? Oroo! Hroooo&mdash;
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' (The little Koholasaurus seems rather happy. He is sitting by the shore &mdash; you should be able to grab him and bring him up now...)
::{{Black Screen|The little Koholasaurus finally quiets down. You carefully carry him up onto the shore...}}
:{{DIcon}} (Pat his tummy...)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Hrooh? Rroooo&mdash;
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' (The little Koholasaurus seems rather happy. He is sitting by the shore &mdash; you should be able to grab him and bring him up now...)
::{{Black Screen|The little Koholasaurus finally quiets down. You carefully carry him up onto the shore...}}
:{{DIcon}} (Try to just grab him straight away...)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Raar! Oroo, rrooh!
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' (The little Koholasaurus seems quite unhappy, and he splashes water all over your face.)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' (The little Koholasaurus watches you expectantly. Time to find a different way to cajole him...)
:;(Return to either choosing option 1 or 2)

;(Talk to Lazy Koholasaurus while [[indwelling]] a [[Saurian]])
:'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Phew... New friend... Hoo...
:{{DIcon}} (Pat his head...)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' New friend! Hoo&mdash;
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' (The little Koholasaurus seems rather happy. He is sitting by the shore...)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Hoo, enough play. Rest...
::(The little Koholasaurus yawns and climbs ashore slowly...)
:{{DIcon}} (Pat his tummy...)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' New friend! Hoo&mdash;
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' (The little Koholasaurus seems rather happy. He is sitting by the shore...)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Hoo, enough play. Rest...
::(The little Koholasaurus yawns and climbs ashore slowly...)
:{{DIcon}} (Try to just grab him straight away...)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' No! Wanna play! No go!
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' (The little Koholasaurus seems quite unhappy, and he splashes water all over your face.)
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' (The little Koholasaurus watches you expectantly. Time to find a different way to cajole him...)
:;(Return to either choosing option 1 or 2)

;(Report back to Pele Nui)
::'''Pele Nui:''' Hahaha. Looks like the kid's fond of you. You convinced him to come along right away.
::'''Pele Nui:''' Thanks so much. Here's your payment. I'll go get him something nice to eat now...
::'''Pele Nui:''' Huh? Where's he gone? H&mdash;He hasn't dived back into the hot springs again, has he?
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Rooo! Wroo&mdash;
::'''Pele Nui:''' Hey, get back here! The springs over there haven't been cleaned yet!

;(Report back to Pele Nui after talking to Lazy Koholasaurus while indwelling a Saurian)
::'''Pele Nui:''' Hmm? Why did he climb ashore by himself? Did he tire of playing?
::'''Pele Nui:'''  ...Well, whatever the case, thanks so much for your help. Here, take your payment. I'll go get him something nice to eat now...
::'''Pele Nui:''' Huh? Where's he gone? H&mdash;He hasn't dived back into the hot springs again, has he?
::'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Rooo! Wroo&mdash;
::'''Pele Nui:''' Hey, get back here! The springs over there haven't been cleaned yet!
:{{Black Screen|The little Koholasaurus jumps joyously toward the other hot spring, with the shouting Pele Nui in hot pursuit...}}

===Pick up the junk in the hot spring===
;(Talk to Pele Nui again, optional)
:'''Pele Nui:''' I'll leave the hot spring over there to you. I'll continue trying to persuade this little fella...

;(Talk to Lazy Koholasaurus, optional)
:'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Hroo...? Rrroo, rroo...

;(Talk to Lazy Koholasaurus while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Phew... New friend... Hoo...

;(Report back to Pele Nui)
:'''Pele Nui:''' Well, you sure enjoyed yourself, huh? As for me, I need to go get changed...
:'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Hroo! Rooh&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} You're all wet...
:'''Pele Nui:''' *cough* He finally decided to listen &mdash; just needed to play with him for a bit, you know?
:'''Pele Nui:''' You're done cleaning the spring over there? Thanks a lot, then. Here, take this as your reward.
:'''Pele Nui:''' Once I'm done cleaning the others, I'll need a change of clothes... Wait, where'd that kid run off to?
:'''Lazy Koholasaurus:''' Wrooh! Hroo&mdash;
:'''Pele Nui:''' Hey, get back here! The springs over there haven't been cleaned yet!
