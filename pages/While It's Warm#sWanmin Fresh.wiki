;(Talk to Chef Mao)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I heard that someone placed a custom order...
:'''Chef Mao:''' Yes, that's correct. A while ago, a customer named Tingfang ordered a bowl of Jewelry Soup from me. He paid in advance, saying that he wanted it delivered to the [[Dunyu Ruins]].
:'''Chef Mao:''' I still need to man the restaurant, so I don't have time to make the delivery. It would be great if you're willing to go in my place.
:{{DIcon}} I'll deliver it right now.
::'''Chef Mao:''' Thanks a lot, you're a big help.
::'''Chef Mao:''' Make sure you keep a good grip on this Jewelry Soup, and be careful while you're delivering it. {{Color|buzzword|Make sure not to knock it over, and make sure you don't glide}}, or it'll all spill out.
::'''Chef Mao:''' Oh yes &mdash; and {{Color|buzzword|don't touch anything weird}}, or the flavors will get all mixed up...
::'''Chef Mao:''' Now, hurry and deliver that Jewelry Soup. It won't be any good once it gets cold.
:;(Obtain [[Special Jewelry Soup]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} I have other things to do.
::'''Chef Mao:''' Sure. I'll find someone else to help...

;(Upon failure via timeout)

:{{DIcon|Quest}} I heard that someone placed a custom order...

:'''Chef Mao:''' He paid quite promptly, and asked that I deliver it to him near [[Guyun Stone Forest]] at a later time.
:'''Chef Mao:''' But I need to man the restaurant at the moment. So, could you deliver it to him for me?
:{{DIcon}} I'll deliver it right now.
::'''Chef Mao:''' I'll leave it to you, then.
::'''Chef Mao:''' Do be careful while you're making the delivery. This dish is rather delicate &mdash; {{Color|buzzword|if you run too fast or bump into something, you might scatter the ingredients}}.
::'''Chef Mao:''' If that happens, I doubt the customer would accept it.
:;(Obtain [[Special Jade Parcels]] ×1)

:'''Chef Mao:''' This Jueyun Chili Chicken won't hold up if you {{Color|buzzword|fly or climb all over the place, if you touch anything elements<!--sic-->, or if you take too long}}. Neglect one of these and you could ruin the taste.
:'''Chef Mao:''' If something happens along the way, come back here and I'll make another serving. Whatever you do, don't bring the name of [[Wanmin Restaurant]] down.
