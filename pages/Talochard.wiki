==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
She used to be the tour guide for the [[Aquabus|Callas Line]], but due to the explosion of [[Fontaine Research Institute]], the line ceased to operate. Talochard's tenure as the line's tour guide was somewhat controversial, as some people complained that her voice sounded like a crow.

When an unknown party stole [[Sir Arthur]], Talochard decides to investigate the matter on her own accord, taking the [[Clockwork Meka]] known as [["Curve"]] out to assist. They are then joined by the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], where they eventually discover the truth of the entire plot. After "Curve" sacrifices itself to save the others from a self-destruct sequence initiated by [[Jenck]], she initially tries to go back for it out of anguish but is convinced to honor its intentions. She then desires revenge against Jenck, but is unable to find him until [[Euphrasie]] notifies them of his capture. Before its destruction, "Curve" believes that Talochard would be the best agent in all of the [[Marechaussee Phantom]]. The Traveler can later return to the workshop's exit, by the shoreline just south of the [[Opera Epiclese]], where they can find a [[Lumidouce Bell]] and a messily-written letter, implied to be Talochard's.
