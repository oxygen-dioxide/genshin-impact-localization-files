==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Camac:''' My friend, could I borrow you for just a moment to ask you a question?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I'm busy at the moment...
::'''Camac:''' Hey, it's not that kind of question!
::'''Camac:''' Just purely out of curiosity, are you a fan of carrots?
::{{DIcon}} They're alright. Very nutritious.
:::'''Camac:''' Aha, I knew it! There are still people out there who appreciate the miracle that is the humble carrot.
:::'''Camac:''' Whenever anyone asks me how I keep my eyes so sharp, I always tell them to eat carrots.
:::'''Camac:''' But most of them just shake their heads and say something like, even if the only alternative was drinking the Masters of the Night-Wind's potions, they'd still choose the latter.
:::'''Camac:''' I don't think they taste that bad though...
:::'''Camac:''' My friend, I'm very touched to hear you say that. I sometimes wonder if there's a god of carrots out there somewhere... If there is, he'll surely be looking out for you.
::{{DIcon}} I find them questionable. They taste like soil...
:::'''Camac:''' O&mdash;Oh...
:::'''Camac:''' Sorry, I look a bit disappointed, don't I? Don't mind me, it's not your fault.
:::'''Camac:''' As a competition referee, I respect everyone's right to love or hate carrots as they so choose.
:::'''Camac:''' I just didn't expect that there were so many people out there who hated them so vehemently. Almost eight or nine out of ten, if you'd believe it...
:::'''Camac:''' I can't say for sure that my good eyesight is all down to my love for carrots, but surely a vegetable that's such a lovely color must be doing something right... right?
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Can't judge a book by its cover...
::::'''Camac:''' Ah, now that you mention it... There's definitely some people who look cute enough, but are real difficult to get along with...
::::'''Camac:''' Err, I'm not talking about anyone specifically, alright?
::::'''Camac:''' *cough* Anyway, back to food... What do people who aren't fond of carrots generally eat? Meat?
::::;(Obtain {{Item|Blazed Meat Stew|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, I've got other matters to attend to at the moment...
::'''Camac:''' Oh, no worries. See you around.
