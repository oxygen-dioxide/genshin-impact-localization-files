==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Grudoc is a subordinate of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Fatui Harbinger]] [[Pantalone]]. When a Fontanian merchant named [[Montluson]] created a new paint and tried to sell it, he quickly discovered that the paint existed in [[Natlan]]. Through unknown means, he managed to contact Pantalone, who saw that Montluson had the potential to shake and disrupt Fontaine's economy and agreed to help him. Grudoc was one of the Fatui sent to assist Montluson in finding the paint in Natlan and destroying it.

When the group arrived at the ruins with their true intentions revealed, Grudoc tried to fight the [[Traveler]] and [[Citlali]], only to find that they were more troublesome than planned and attempted to abandon Montluson, citing an exculpatory clause. Prior to their arrival, he had planted explosives that were strong enough to destroy the ruins and attempted to flee, only to be stopped by Citlali. Knowing that his capture would implicate Pantalone, Grudoc unleashed his backup plan &mdash; using a nearby spear and throwing it at the sphere, critically damaging it and sending everyone into an alternate space. The Traveler and Citlali were able to escape, and Paimon asked what happened to Grudoc and the others. Citlali told her that he was likely crushed if he did not escape in time.
