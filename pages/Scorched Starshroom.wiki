'''Scorched Starshroom''' is a food item that can be obtained in [[Sumeru]] by applying {{Pyro}} to a [[Starshroom]]. They are also a type of [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]].

Scorched Starshrooms restore 1 HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]]; this can only target characters of the player's party.

==How to Obtain==
Scorched Starshrooms can be obtained by applying {{Pyro}} to [[Starshroom]]s found in the overworld of [[Sumeru]]. Scorched Starshrooms can also be found by themselves without applying {{Pyro}} in [[Old Vanarana]] before completing [[Nursery of Lost Dreams]]. Scorched Starshrooms cannot be obtained from the Starshrooms in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]].
