:'''Plauen:''' Give it a go! This is the special festive event that the Adventurers' Guild has prepared for everyone.
:{{DIcon}} What's in this domain?
::'''Plauen:''' This is a special domain that was discovered by the Adventurers' Guild some time ago. It seems to only turn up at specific times.
::'''Plauen:''' There are quite a few interesting things going on inside. We've opened it to the public after some modification work.
::'''Plauen:''' If you're interested, please feel free to attempt this challenge. Do it alone, or call your friends, either is fine!
::{{DIcon}} It's not dangerous in there, is it?
::'''Plauen:''' Don't worry, we'll have seasoned adventurers accompanying you all the way if you bring people without any experience.
::'''Plauen:''' But I think that a veteran such as you will be fine.
:{{DIcon}} Do you know about any of the other activities?
::'''Plauen:''' Hmm, for this, you can go look for [[Lizzie]]. She's always introducing fun events to people during the [[Windblume Festival]].
::'''Plauen:''' I hope that you'll enjoy yourself, too!
:{{DIcon}} See you around!
::'''Plauen:''' See you. Come back and challenge this domain again if you have the time.
