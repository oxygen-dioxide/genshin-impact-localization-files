* Weak points are only exposed while charging the '''Bomb Barrage''' or '''Shockwave''' attacks.
* Weak points are no longer treated as weak points after being hit, until they are repaired.

==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''
===Ruin Serpent===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Energy Drain
|desc_1 = At the start of the fight, if the player's [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]] is equipped, its stored energy will be reduced to 2.
|strat_1 = Equipping the Lumenstone Adjuvant after the fight starts will bypass the energy drain.

|name_2 = Oozing Concretions
|desc_2 = Burrows into the ground before resurfacing, creating 4 sources of [[Oozing Concretions]] at the corners of the arena. Oozing Concretions can be destroyed using the Blooming Light released by the player's Lumenstone Adjuvant.
* Alongside the Oozing Concretions, a yellow rock will also be created. Destroying the yellow rock will recharge 3 energy for the Lumenstone Adjuvant.
* This ability is disabled in the [[Spiral Abyss]].
|file_2_2 = Ruin Serpent Yellow Rock
|caption_2_2 = Yellow Rock

|name_3 = Steamroll
|desc_3 = Rolls its body on the ground in an arc, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact. This attack cannot be evaded with dash i-frames.
|file_3 = Ruin Serpent Attack 1

|name_4 = Charge and Drill
|desc_4 = Charges towards the player and burrows, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact. It then resurfaces and plants its drill into the ground, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. The charge cannot be evaded with dash i-frames.
|file_4 = Ruin Serpent Attack 2

|name_5 = Sand Tomb
|desc_5 = Burrows and resurfaces, creating a large [[Vacuum Field]] that sucks players towards the center while dealing '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DoT}}. If it comes in contact with the player while burrowing or resurfacing at the beginning or end of this attack, deals '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
|file_5 = Ruin Serpent Attack 3

|name_6 = Bomb Barrage
|desc_6 = Charges by drawing power from the Oozing Concretions, before shooting a barrage of projectiles at the player, each dealing '''40% ATK''' if two sources were absorbed or '''30% ATK''' if a single source was absorbed as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit. Gains '''300%''' [[RES]] to all DMG while charging.
|file_6 = Ruin Serpent Attack 4

|name_7 = Shockwave
|desc_7 = Charges by drawing power from the Oozing Concretions, before releasing a massive blast downwards, dealing '''200% ATK''' if two sources were absorbed or '''100% ATK''' if a single source was absorbed as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. Gains '''300%''' [[RES]] to all DMG while charging.
|file_7 = Ruin Serpent Attack 5
|strat_7 = The two Oozing Concretion sources that the Ruin Serpent absorbs to perform this attack are close together. If the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]] is [[Enhance the Lumenstone Adjuvant|enhanced]] to level 8, it will be able to destroy both sources at once due to the increased AoE.

|name_8 = Paralyzed
|desc_8 = During '''Bomb Barrage''' and '''Shockwave''', the Ruin Serpent will expose 4 weak points in the form of its glowing segments. A segment will be broken once hit, indicated by smoke and electric spark effects. Destroying an Oozing Concretion source that the Ruin Serpent is attempting to absorb with the Lumenstone Adjuvant will also destroy 2 weak points. Once all 4 weak points are destroyed, the Ruin Serpent will be temporarily paralyzed.
* In the Spiral Abyss, due to the lack of Oozing Concretions, the Ruin Serpent can only be paralyzed by striking its weak points.
|file_8 = Ruin Serpent Stunned
|caption  = Paralyzed by Lumenstone Adjuvent
|file_8_2 = Ruin Serpent Stunned 2
|caption_8_2 = Paralyzed by Striking Weak Points
}}

===Haftvad the Worm===
The quest-exclusive variant of the Ruin Serpent appearing in the [[Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?]] [[World Quest]], '''Haftvad the Worm''', behaves slightly differently in combat. Haftvad the Worm can only create 2 sources of '''Oozing Concretions''' as opposed to 4, and the '''Charge and Drill''' attack is disabled. The fight also ends once the boss reaches ~30% of its health as a cutscene triggers shortly afterwards.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|From within the depths of The Chasm come faint bursts of machine motion...|[[Adventurer Handbook]], before unlocking Ruin Serpent}}
{{Description|A bizarrely-shaped machine that prowls the underground areas of [[The Chasm]].<br />It has a formidable gear in front of it that can carve through rock as if it were butter. It was by this power that it was able to dig a tunnel to The Chasm from "somewhere."|Adventurer Handbook}}
{{Description|An ancient, bizzarely-shaped autonomous machine.<br />It is said that this was heavy-duty engineering equipment left behind by a nation that has been destroyed. The gear system on its "head" can grind its way through even the hardest bedrock. If this was the case, then carving out tunnels with which the forces of this nation might access the whole continent would have been a thing of great ease.|[[Archive]]}}
