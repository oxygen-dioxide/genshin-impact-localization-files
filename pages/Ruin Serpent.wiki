{{Description|An ancient, bizzarely-shaped autonomous machine.<br />It is said that this was heavy-duty engineering equipment left behind by a nation that has been destroyed. The gear system on its "head" can grind its way through even the hardest bedrock. If this was the case, then carving out tunnels with which the forces of this nation might access the whole continent would have been a thing of great ease.|[[Archive]]}}
{{Enemy Intro}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
===Ruin Serpent===
''Attack names are unofficial.''

*'''Energy Drain:''' At the start of the fight, if the player's [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]] is equipped, its stored energy will be reduced to 2.
** Equipping the Lumenstone Adjuvant after the fight starts will bypass the energy drain.
*'''Oozing Concretions:''' Burrows into the ground before resurfacing, creating 4 sources of [[Oozing Concretions]] at the corners of the arena. Oozing Concretions can be destroyed using the Blooming Light released by the player's Lumenstone Adjuvant.
** Alongside the Oozing Concretions, a yellow rock will also be created. Destroying the yellow rock will recharge 3 energy for the Lumenstone Adjuvant.
** This ability is disabled in the [[Spiral Abyss]].
*'''Steamroll:''' Rolls its body on the ground in an arc, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact. This attack cannot be evaded with dash i-frames.
*'''Charge and Drill:''' Charges towards the player and burrows, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact. It then resurfaces and plants its drill into the ground, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. The charge cannot be evaded with dash i-frames.
*'''Vortex:''' Burrows and resurfaces, creating a large [[Vacuum Field]] that sucks players towards the center while dealing '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DoT}}. If it comes in contact with the player while burrowing or resurfacing at the beginning or end of this attack, deals '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
*'''Bomb Barrage:''' Charges by drawing power from the Oozing Concretions, before shooting a barrage of projectiles at the player, each dealing '''40% ATK''' if two sources were absorbed or '''30% ATK''' if a single source was absorbed as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit. Gains '''300%''' [[RES]] to all DMG while charging.
*'''Shockwave:''' Charges by drawing power from the Oozing Concretions, before releasing a massive blast downwards, dealing '''200% ATK''' if two sources were absorbed or '''100% ATK''' if a single source was absorbed as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. Gains '''300%''' [[RES]] to all DMG while charging.
*'''Paralyzed:'''
**During '''Bomb Barrage''' and '''Shockwave''', the Ruin Serpent will expose 4 weak points in the form of its glowing segments. A segment will be broken once hit, indicated by smoke and electric spark effects. Destroying an Oozing Concretion source that the Ruin Serpent is attempting to absorb with the Lumenstone Adjuvant will also destroy 2 weak points.
**Once all 4 weak points are destroyed, the Ruin Serpent will be temporarily paralyzed.

===Haftvad the Worm===
The quest-exclusive variant of the Ruin Serpent appearing in the [[Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?]] [[World Quest]], '''Haftvad the Worm''', behaves slightly differently in combat. Haftvad the Worm can only create 2 sources of '''Oozing Concretions''' as opposed to 4, and the '''Charge and Drill''' attack is disabled. The fight also ends once the boss reaches ~30% of its health as a cutscene triggers shortly afterwards.
