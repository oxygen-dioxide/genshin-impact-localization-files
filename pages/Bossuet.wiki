==Profile==
Junior Researchers [[Chisseray]], [[Genevieve]], [[Maillardet]], and [[Sevigne]] once worked with Bossuet at the Fontaine Research Institute.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Treacherous Light of the Depths}}</ref><ref>Interactable: [[Bossuet's Abandoned Laboratory#Bossuet Research Institute Project Result Summary (II)|Bossuet Research Institute Project Result Summary (II)]]</ref> During Bossuet's reign, the institute was renamed to the "Bossuet Research Institute". Chisseray holds Bossuet in particularly low esteem, leaving behind sarcastic and resentful remarks.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chisseray|quote=He's an old fogey whose vision has already started to go, a researcher without an ounce of creativity, an honorary clothes rack that thinks the world of himself, a bloodsucker who feeds on the research of others and is utterly useless without his subordinates.}}</ref>

Bossuet left behind [[Bossuet's Abandoned Laboratory#Portrait|a portrait]] of himself in their [[Bossuet's Abandoned Laboratory|underwater laboratory]] beneath [[Mary-Ann Memorial Park]]. Sevigne was surprised that Bossuet did not take the portrait to [[Petrichor]]. Bossuet was also the one who proposed the idea of creating the [[Icewind Suite]], which Maillardet later followed up on.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sevigne}}</ref> The two meka were originally designed for non-combat purposes, but when Maillardet suggested giving them combat capabilities, Bossuet opposed the idea. Eventually, following a "happy accident", Bossuet departed to Petrichor to retire, allowing Maillardet to continue with his modifications to the Icewind Suite without any objections.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Maillardet}}</ref>

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bossuet:''' What should tonight's menu be...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Bossuet:''' Oh, right. I'm working on tonight's menu. After much contemplation, I decided on fish for the main dish, to go with a few special drinks...
::'''Bossuet:''' I'm sure those gentlemen will be pleased.
::'''Bossuet:''' Thanks to the [[Remus|God King]]'s grace, the spices I ordered finally arrived on time, and combined with some fish fresh from the ocean...
::'''Bossuet:''' Well, feel free to stay and have a taste! Trust me, fish are my specialty!
:{{DIcon}} B&mdash;Bye!
::'''Bossuet:''' Oh, going already? Alright then, take care.

:'''Bossuet:''' Fish... Ah, yes, that's right. This is the fish I discovered most recently...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after completing ''Daydreams Beyond Space and Time''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bossuet:''' This cannon's design is fascinating... Most interesting indeed...
:{{DIcon}} You want to make a cannon?
::'''Bossuet:''' Me? No, no, this cannon was designed by [[Mécantre]] and [[Babisse]]. I just had some... peripheral participation in the discussions.
::'''Bossuet:''' Even though the design philosophy and purpose of this cannon are intriguing to say the least, I must say that this line of thinking is quite... well, overboard.
::'''Bossuet:''' A "daydream" in all senses of the word.
::'''Bossuet:''' Putting aside the cannon material and the shape of the projectile it must fire, immense amounts of propellant must be expended to fire any shell up to the altitude they desire...
::'''Bossuet:''' Hehe, the fuel they'd need could stuff four or five cannons of this caliber to the brim.
::'''Bossuet:''' ...That said, I reckon it's not a bad thing that their research continues. My guidance may yet ensure that their work bears fruit that will be useful in other fields...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
:;({{cx}})<!--Possibly not completing [[Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble]])-->
:::'''Bossuet:''' Hmm? You've not heard of me? Well, I suppose you don't look like researchers on the cutting edge either.
:::'''Bossuet:''' Bossuet's the name. I once worked at the Fontaine Research Institute.
:::'''Bossuet:''' If you have time to visit the Institute, I'm sure you'll find many an academic achievement credited to me, and researchers who have received my mentorship.
:::'''Bossuet:''' Ah, but that said, I'm not providing professional guidance at the moment.
:::'''Bossuet:''' I've retired from my research post, and am here in peaceful retirement. If you wanted professional aid, I fear I must disappoint you.
:;({{cx}})<!--Possibly completing [[Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble]])-->
:::'''Bossuet:''' You don't know of me? Or rather, you don't recognize me? Oh, wonderful. [[Raimondo]] and [[Choiseul]]'s plan to erase me from the Institute has gone swimmingly. How happy I am for them.
:::'''Bossuet:''' Pleased to make your acquaintance, Honorary Senior Researcher. I am Bossuet, and I once worked at the Fontaine Research Institute.
:::'''Bossuet:''' I believe you might have found many a fruit of my academic labor in the Institute, and met some of my mentees to boot. Your fame has reached me here, thanks to the trusty [[Steambird]].
:::'''Bossuet:''' Oh, by the way, I've resigned from my post as a researcher, and I'm here in quiet retirement. Not taking mentorships at the moment.
:::'''Bossuet:''' So if that's what you were looking for, you're going to be disappointed, I fear.
:{{DIcon}} ...Goodbye.
::'''Bossuet:''' See you. Take care now.
