===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yegor:''' Hello, is there anything I can do for you?
:{{DIcon}} What's bothering you?
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Yegor:''' It's actually not that big of a deal. I'm applying to travel to [[Narukami Island]], and I'm guessing that my request should be processed soon.
:::'''Yegor:''' But I'm a Snezhnayan, and I'm not really used to the diet here, nor am I a good cook myself.
:::'''Yegor:''' I'm fine here in Ritou, but I've heard that there isn't a single shop run by outlanders on Narukami Island. There are only Inazuma-style restaurants available.
:::'''Yegor:''' *sigh* I wonder if I can still eat anything that reminds me of home once I'm in [[Inazuma City]]... If only Miss [[Ryouko]] could come with me as well...
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Yegor:''' It's nothing serious, really. I'm living just fine here in Ritou, and business has been great since the [[Sakoku Decree]] was abolished.
:::'''Yegor:''' But I'm a Snezhnayan, and I'm not really used to the diet here, nor am I a good cook myself.
:::'''Yegor:''' I'm fine here in Ritou, but I've heard that there isn't a single shop run by outlanders in Inazuma City. There are only Inazuma-style restaurants available.
:::'''Yegor:''' *sigh* I wonder if I can still eat anything that reminds me of home once I'm in Inazuma City... If only Miss Ryouko could come with me as well...
::{{DIcon}} Why did you come to Inazuma?
:::'''Yegor:''' As you can see, I'm a Snezhnayan merchant. So naturally, I'm here for business.
:::'''Yegor:''' Apart from doing business, I also plan to travel around Inazuma.
:::'''Yegor:''' I've heard a lot of legends about places in Inazuma. Perhaps I may be able to find something if I go check those places out.
::{{DIcon}} Miss Ryouko?
:::'''Yegor:''' Yeah. Miss Ryouko is a lady who runs a food stall there. Have you ever tried her snacks?
:::'''Yegor:''' She knew that I wouldn't be used to the food here, so she changed the taste up for me... That's so sweet of her!
:::'''Yegor:''' I've heard that her husband passed away several years ago, leaving her to take care of the stall alone...
:::'''Yegor:''' Hmm... I suppose I should go visit her stall more often.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Help her...
::::'''Yegor:''' Say, if I learn how to cook, would I be able to open a shop with Ryouko?
::::'''Yegor:''' I tried cooking recently, but it feels like I'm not made of the right stuff for a chef...
::::'''Yegor:''' Have a try. Is my cooking really that bad...?
:::;(Obtain [[Suspicious Steak]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yegor:''' Okay, goodbye.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yegor:''' The legendary treasure... Now isn't that exciting?
:{{DIcon}} Treasure?
:;(Before completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Yegor:''' Huh? You heard that? Oh, that's problematic, um...
:::'''Yegor:''' But judging by your gear, you're a seasoned adventurer... Well, then I'll be honest with you.
:::'''Yegor:''' I have a friend who has been to Inazuma before. He told me a lot of legends about the treasures in Inazuma. He also mentioned a lot of places, like [[Konda Village]] or whatever that place is called...
:::'''Yegor:''' Sadly, I can't leave Ritou yet. If you can figure out a way to get into Inazuma, could you help me ask around?
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Yegor:''' Huh? You heard that? Oh, that's problematic, um...
:::'''Yegor:''' But judging by your gear, you seem like a seasoned adventurer... Well, then I'll be honest with you.
:::'''Yegor:''' I have a friend who has been to Inazuma before. He told me a lot of legends about the treasures in Inazuma. He also mentioned a lot of places, like Konda Village or whatever that place is called...
:::'''Yegor:''' If you've got some contacts, could you help me ask around?
::{{DIcon}} Aren't you afraid that I might take the treasures for myself?
::'''Yegor:''' Hehe, I don't think you will. After all, I haven't told you the most important piece of information yet!
::'''Yegor:''' Even if you find out anything about it, you'll still need clues from me to continue.
::'''Yegor:''' And I on the other hand am no expert adventurer. I'll need a helping hand.
::'''Yegor:''' Once you get the information, we can strike up a partnership. Rest assured, I will pay you handsomely.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yegor:''' Goodbye.
