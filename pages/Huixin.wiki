==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing Sea of Clouds, Sea of People)
:'''Huixin:''' And you are...? For civil matters, please go to the Liyue [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]].
;(After completing Sea of Clouds, Sea of People)
:'''Huixin:''' Oh, it's you. How may I help?
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(Unlocked after completing [[The Fond Farewell]])
::'''Huixin:''' Now that we've sent Rex Lapis off, we will never again receive his direction...
::'''Huixin:''' ...That burden now falls upon the Qixing.
::'''Huixin:''' But I don't fear for our future. Other than the Qixing, we do still have [[Ganyu]]. She'll do a great job supporting the Qixing, I'm sure of it!
:{{DIcon}} I have some questions.
::'''Huixin:''' Please, ask away! I will answer to the best of my ability.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Liyue.
:::'''Huixin:''' Oh? I take you aren't from around here, then.
:::'''Huixin:''' Not that there's any problem with that, we do not exclude anybody here in Liyue! On the contrary, with this being a commercial port, people get nervous if they see a decline in the foreign population.
:::'''Huixin:''' Thanks to the guidance of [[Rex Lapis]], Liyue has gone from strength to strength in the last thousand years.
:::'''Huixin:''' Our forebears discovered the craft of producing glazes via firing. Trade with foreign lands grew, and Liyue prospered.
:::'''Huixin:''' Our biggest point of pride is that Mora, the coins used as currency throughout [[Teyvat]], are cast right here in Liyue at the [[Golden House]]. More importantly, Mora are named after Morax, which is Rex Lapis' original name.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Qixing.
:::'''Huixin:''' You could say the Qixing are my bosses... Surely it doesn't count as workplace gossip if I'm just giving you their backstories? Haha...
:::'''Huixin:''' The Qixing &mdash; or "Seven Stars" &mdash; is a Liyue business committee. It is also used as a collective term for the seven business tycoons who sit on the committee and handle Liyue's government affairs.
:::'''Huixin:''' I trust you have heard of [[Ningguang]], of the [[Jade Chamber]]? Like her, each Qixing is a major player in business circles whose every action has a profound influence.
:::'''Huixin:''' They are responsible for implementing the policy that comes down from Rex Lapis and making rulings on important matters. They are akin to the hands and feet of Rex Lapis.
:::{{DIcon}} Could you tell me a bit more about the Qixing?
:::'''Huixin:''' Hmm, the Qixing do in fact have a clear internal division of labor.
:::'''Huixin:''' Besides Lady Ningguang, with whom you are familiar, the Yuheng, Lady [[Keqing]], is in charge of land, construction works and the like.
:::'''Huixin:''' Liyue is very vast, and requires strict regulation and eminent developmental direction...
:::'''Huixin:''' The other esteemed members of the Qixing are also highly accomplished in their own fields. They are the pillars of the prosperity that Liyue enjoys today.
::{{DIcon}} Where are we right now?
:::'''Huixin:''' We are at Yuehai Pavilion. This is where the Qixing discuss official business and rule on major issues that affect the whole of Liyue.
:::'''Huixin:''' To serve the Qixing is to serve all of Liyue, so it is my honor to be working here.
:::'''Huixin:''' Sometimes I feel like the whole way I carry myself has become more dignified since I started working here. Hehehe.
:::'''Huixin:''' None of the big shots are here right now &mdash; presumably they're all busy with private business.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Huixin:''' Bye. Good luck with everything.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Huixin:''' Oh, hello. I wasn't expecting visitors at this time.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Huixin:''' Yuehai Pavilion is closed at the moment. I like to come here when there is no business to attend to, to stretch my legs and think about things.
::'''Huixin:''' There is so much that is inscrutable in this world... The seasonal rhythm of the monsoons, the nature of [[Celestia]], destiny itself... and what goes on inside other people's heads...
::'''Huixin:''' I do wonder what goes on in the minds of the Qixing...
::'''Huixin:''' Surely the Geo Archon isn't...
:{{DIcon}} Please excuse me.
::'''Huixin:''' Bye. Mind your step in the dark.

==Trivia==
* During the Closed Beta Test version of [[Lantern Rite]], Huixin was one of the event organizers.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/VQMrt5WaqTY Lantern Event - Day 2 &#91;CBT2&#93;]</ref> She did not retain that role in [[Version 1.2]]'s rendition of the event, where her dialogue and role was largely transferred to the event-exclusive NPC [[Wang'ya]].
