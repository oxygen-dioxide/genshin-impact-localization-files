==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing Sea of Clouds, Sea of People)
:'''Huixin:''' And you are...? For civil matters, please go to the Liyue [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]].
;(After completing Sea of Clouds, Sea of People)
:'''Huixin:''' Oh, it's you. How may I help?
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(Unlocked after completing [[The Fond Farewell]])
::'''Huixin:''' Now that we've sent Rex Lapis off, we will never again receive his direction...
::'''Huixin:''' ...That burden now falls upon the Qixing.
::'''Huixin:''' But I don't fear for our future. Other than the Qixing, we do still have [[Ganyu]]. She'll do a great job supporting the Qixing, I'm sure of it!
:{{DIcon}} I have some questions.
::'''Huixin:''' Please, ask away! I will answer to the best of my ability.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Liyue.
:::'''Huixin:''' Oh? I take you aren't from around here, then.
:::'''Huixin:''' Not that there's any problem with that, we do not exclude anybody here in Liyue! On the contrary, with this being a commercial port, people get nervous if they see a decline in the foreign population.
:::'''Huixin:''' Thanks to the guidance of [[Rex Lapis]], Liyue has gone from strength to strength in the last thousand years.
:::'''Huixin:''' Our forebears discovered the craft of producing glazes via firing. Trade with foreign lands grew, and Liyue prospered.
:::'''Huixin:''' Our biggest point of pride is that Mora, the coins used as currency throughout [[Teyvat]], are cast right here in Liyue at the [[Golden House]]. More importantly, Mora are named after Morax, which is Rex Lapis' original name.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Qixing.
:::'''Huixin:''' You could say the Qixing are my bosses... Surely it doesn't count as workplace gossip if I'm just giving you their backstories? Haha...
:::'''Huixin:''' The Qixing &mdash; or "Seven Stars" &mdash; is a Liyue business committee. It is also used as a collective term for the seven business tycoons who sit on the committee and handle Liyue's government affairs.
:::'''Huixin:''' I trust you have heard of [[Ningguang]], of the [[Jade Chamber]]? Like her, each Qixing is a major player in business circles whose every action has a profound influence.
:::'''Huixin:''' They are responsible for implementing the policy that comes down from Rex Lapis and making rulings on important matters. They are akin to the hands and feet of Rex Lapis.
:::{{DIcon}} Could you tell me a bit more about the Qixing?
:::'''Huixin:''' Hmm, the Qixing do in fact have a clear internal division of labor.
:::'''Huixin:''' Besides Lady Ningguang, with whom you are familiar, the Yuheng, Lady [[Keqing]], is in charge of land, construction works and the like.
:::'''Huixin:''' Liyue is very vast, and requires strict regulation and eminent developmental direction...
:::'''Huixin:''' The other esteemed members of the Qixing are also highly accomplished in their own fields. They are the pillars of the prosperity that Liyue enjoys today.
::{{DIcon}} Where are we right now?
:::'''Huixin:''' We are at Yuehai Pavilion. This is where the Qixing discuss official business and rule on major issues that affect the whole of Liyue.
:::'''Huixin:''' To serve the Qixing is to serve all of Liyue, so it is my honor to be working here.
:::'''Huixin:''' Sometimes I feel like the whole way I carry myself has become more dignified since I started working here. Hehehe.
:::'''Huixin:''' None of the big shots are here right now &mdash; presumably they're all busy with private business.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Huixin:''' Bye. Good luck with everything.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Huixin:''' Oh, hello. I wasn't expecting visitors at this time.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Huixin:''' Yuehai Pavilion is closed at the moment. I like to come here when there is no business to attend to, to stretch my legs and think about things.
::'''Huixin:''' There is so much that is inscrutable in this world... The seasonal rhythm of the monsoons, the nature of [[Celestia]], destiny itself... and what goes on inside other people's heads...
::'''Huixin:''' I do wonder what goes on in the minds of the Qixing...
::'''Huixin:''' Surely the Geo Archon isn't...
:{{DIcon}} Please excuse me.
::'''Huixin:''' Bye. Mind your step in the dark.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Huixin during daytime)
:'''Huixin:''' Hello, welcome to the Moonchase Festival here in Liyue.
:'''Huixin:''' The theme of this year's Moonchase Festival is gourmet food, and this iteration of Masterful Chefs is being organized by the Liyue Qixing themselves. With all the great chefs taking part, this is one show you don't want to miss!
:'''Huixin:''' I hope that everyone will have a good time during the festival. Of course, if you do have civil affairs at hand, please direct your concerns to the Ministry.

===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
;(Talk to Huixin during daytime)
:'''Huixin:''' Oh, it's you. How may I help?
:'''Huixin:''' I've heard that you contributed greatly to the rebuilding of the [[Jade Chamber]] and to the relatively small amount of damage that Liyue Harbor suffered at the hands of our ocean-borne enemy. You have my thanks.
:'''Huixin:''' Please enjoy the Lantern Rite for the duration of your stay.
:;(Continue non-event dialogue)
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* During the Closed Beta Test version of [[Lantern Rite]], Huixin was one of the event organizers.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/VQMrt5WaqTY Lantern Event - Day 2 &#91;CBT2&#93;]</ref> She did not retain that role in [[Version 1.2]]'s rendition of the event, where her dialogue and role was largely transferred to the event-exclusive NPC [[Wang'ya]].
