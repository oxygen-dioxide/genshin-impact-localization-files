==Trivia==
*The Chinese name of the dish translates to {{Lang|Four Directions' Peace|zh=四方和平|zh_rm=Sìfāng Hépíng}}; the Mandarin phrase "four directions" is a synonym for "everywhere." It likely refers to {{Lang|eight treasure rice|zh=八宝饭|zh_rm=bābǎofàn}}, a Chinese rice pudding usually served in the Lunar New Year to wish good luck and increasing prosperity.

* To celebrate [[Ganyu]]'s birthday, the Teyvat Food Notes released a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/18990 real-life recipe] for both [[Prosperous Peace]] and this base dish, Universal Peace.
