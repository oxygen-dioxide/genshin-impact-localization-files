'''Settings''' are where one goes to configure various games options, and is accessible from the [[Paimon Menu]]. A limited version can be accessed on the [[Login Menu]] after reaching the door. Settings are globalized on a device, meaning that if another person logs on with the same device they will have the same settings as what the other player already set them to, as settings are device specific.
