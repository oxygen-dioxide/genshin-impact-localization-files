|text1    = Dew Bubbles will burst when they are {{color|help|attacked}}, {{color|help|releasing ripples}}. They can be {{color|help|moved}} by the abilities of the Xenochromatic Ball Octopus, so this method may be used to change their position. When the Dew Bubbles are being moved, the circle that appears may be used to preview the area of effect of their ripples when they burst. When 2 small Dew Bubbles touch, they will {{color|help|merge into}} a large Dew Bubble, and when that bursts, it will release ripples with an {{color|help|even larger}} area of effect.

|text2    = Dew Branches that can sometimes be seen around can produce Dew Bubbles. But like many other things, when a contaminated bacterial mat surrounds them, they will cease their activity.

|text3    = These ripples are necessary to complete Harmonious Reed Pipe challenges, and can also interact with Hydro Elemental Monuments and other mechanisms and objects sensitive to the Hydro Element.
