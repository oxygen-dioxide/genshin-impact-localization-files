|text1    = Balls made of metal that can be grabbed by the [[Scions of the Canopy]] using grappling hooks or [[Yumkasaurus|Yumkasaurs]] using their own abilities. Once you obtain one, {{Color|help|Hold}} to aim and {{Color|help|Release}} to fire.<br>If the ball flies onto a metal platform, that platform will activate.<br>However, these balls will not vanish, unlike real Relay Balls, so they can be removed from platforms that they are not locked to and re-used.
