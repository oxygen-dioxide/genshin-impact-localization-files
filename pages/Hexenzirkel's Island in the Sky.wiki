{{Location Intro|'''Hexenzirkel's Island in the Sky''' ''(unofficial name)''|description=<p>{{If Self|Hexenzirkel's Island in the Sky|It|Hexenzirkel's Island in the Sky}} was a meeting place of the [[Hexenzirkel]], where they would meet to have tea parties. Access to it was kept under the care of [[Barbatos]] and required an incantation to enter. It is unlocked after completing {{Quest|Joy Above the Clouds}}.</p><!--

--><p>At the center of the island is a long tea party table with seven chairs arranged around it &mdash; three on one side, two on the other, and one at each end. The Lantern of Utmost Joy is at the center of the table. A small [["Witch's Chorus"|phonograph]], similar to the one [[Alice]] used during ''[[Midsummer Island Adventure]]'', is near the head of the table. Various books, flowers, and silverware for a tea party are scattered around as well.</p>}}

To access the island, one must approach the cliff overlooking Falcon Coast and say the incantation: "Place the squirrel on the back of the pointy-eared cat, and a pious puppy will open the doors to show you the way..." After reaching the island, the Lantern of Utmost Joy can be operated by having four people sit around it and speak the words "Please allow me to disturb your happy peace."<ref name="Joy">{{Ref/Quest|Joy Above the Clouds}}</ref>

During the [[Windblume Festival]], the Traveler was granted access to the island by [[Venti]] as part of a quest to find the Lantern of Utmost Joy.
