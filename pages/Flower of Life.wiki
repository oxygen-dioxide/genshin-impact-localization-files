'''Flower of Life''', or simply "'''the Flower'''", is an [[Artifact]] Piece in [[Genshin Impact]]. It increases a [[character]]'s HP stat by adding flat +HP and is one of the two Artifact Pieces to have a set main stat (along with the [[Plume of Death]]). Artifact Pieces can appear in all rarities (1-5 stars).

It is considered to be one of the easiest pieces to get "good stats" on because of its set main stat: the variance is therefore strict to the substats. Note that Artifacts cannot share the same main stat as substats, so Flowers of Life cannot have the flat +HP substat. It is possible, however, to have +HP% in a Flower since it is considered a different type of substat.
