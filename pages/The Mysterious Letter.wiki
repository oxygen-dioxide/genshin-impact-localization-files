{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo cnlq101 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We haven't seen our [[Sumeru]] friends for a while now. Paimon wonders how they're doing...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, let's go to [[Sumeru City]] and catch up with them!

;(Approach the entrance to the Akademiya)
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, the [[Akademiya]] sure is busy during the day!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... But where should we go looking for people that we know...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cyno! It's been so long since we last saw you!
:{{DIcon}} Really feels like it's been forever.
::{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 02a 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Welcome back to Sumeru City. I'm delighted to meet you again.
:{{DIcon}} You look like you've been keeping well.
::{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 02b 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' As do you. You don't seem weary at all from your travels &mdash; if anything, you seem stronger.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' So. What brings you back here?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, nothing in particular. Paimon just... saw a really big mushroom out on the road the other day, and suddenly missed all our friends in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Funnily enough, we were reminiscing about you recently, too. It was at a group dinner. I look forward to hearing about your travels &mdash; something tells me we must have a lot to catch up on.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really, you were thinking of us too? What a coincidence!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Indeed... Or as I call it, the Biryani factor.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...You really want me to say the rest? Heh, okay. It's always rice to meat stew again.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... darn, he said it!
:{{DIcon}} I win the bet, Paimon! Time to pay up.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You like that one, huh? You must, if you remember it after all this time. Admit the truth! You have long been in awe of my razor-sharp wit.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, alright, here's your five hundred Mora...
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Cyno. Feels good to hit the jackpot.
::{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 08a 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You're exaggerating. It's only five hundred Mora.
::{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 09a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, five hundred Mora is still a lot of snacks to Paimon!
::{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 08a 2.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, I'll treat you to some desserts later.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Paimon. Feels good to hit the jackpot.
::{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 09b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's never making a bet again... Paimon really thought Cyno would be able to hold back on the jokes... They say people can change, but maybe that's just wishful thinking.
::{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 08b 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Ah, so this was technically my fault? In that case, I'll treat you to some sweets later.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Anyway, I'm actually investigating a case right now. My mind is focused on work, which is why I didn't complete the joke at first.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A case? What happened?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Nothing major. But after finding out who was involved, I decided, on reflection, to handle this one myself.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Need any help? We only came here to hang out, so we've got the time. You may as well take us with you, and then when you're done, we can, uh... y'know! *nom* *nom*
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Such enthusiasm. Are you worried I'll forget about treating you to some sweets if you're not around to remind me?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whaaat? Nooo! ...Alright, was it really that obvious?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Obvious enough. Still, it's a fine idea. You are the heroes of Sumeru. It makes perfect sense to work together.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 2 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright. Follow me.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|There, you meet Cyno, who is about to undertake official business. He tells you there is a new case in Sumeru City...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter the Akademiya)
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Do you see him? The old man flailing around.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Is he the one you wanted to talk to about the case?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Correct. His name is [[Cyrus (Sumeru)|Cyrus]], a former [[Spantamad]] [[Sumeru Akademiya#Academic Progression|Sage]]. He taught both me and [[Lisa]].
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? Cyno's teacher is in trouble?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' It's ridiculous... I'm just an old man who enjoys a spot of gardening, shopping, and wine. What sort of person targets an old retiree?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Professor, I've brought some friends.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 spantamadcyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ah, Cyno! Now, who do we have here...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 spantamadcyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hmm? Hold on, let me think... A flying fairy dressed in white, a youth who does not seem to hail from this land.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 spantamadcyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' My goodness, you must be the legendary Traveler and Paimon. I've heard all about what you've done for Sumeru.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Looks like we're really famous!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I've told him about you before. You are my friends, after all.
:{{DIcon}} Good to meet you, Sir. We're here to help Cyno.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That's right. Let me summarize the situation.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' A couple of days ago, Professor Cyrus suddenly received a threat letter.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A threat letter!?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 spantamadcyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Exactly! Who sends a threat letter to an old man like me, for goodness' sake?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' This is the letter in question.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Cyrus, I have uncovered your secret. If you wish to prevent it from going public, leave ten million Mora at the back door of the café."
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Secondly, don't come looking for me. You'll never find me, but I will always be watching you and all of your secrets. Finally, if you dare to report this to the [[matra]], there will be consequences."
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow. They sure didn't mince their words...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Clearly, this person must be desperate for Mora.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 spantamadcyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ten million Mora! What a joke!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 spantamadcyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' I'm just a single retiree, with nothing to my name beyond the tomatoes in my garden... Where do people think I'm hiding ten million Mora, hmm? In my tomatoes?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There were no witnesses, so currently the letter is all we've got. So {{Traveler}}, Paimon, let's put our heads together.
:{{DIcon}} Ready when you are.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's ready, too!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, take a look. Do you see anything suspicious?
;(Open Mysterious Letter)
::'''Mysterious Letter'''
::[[File:Story Quest Oathkeeper Mysterious Letter.png|150px]]
::"Cyrus, I have uncovered your secret. If you wish to prevent it from going public, leave ten million Mora at the back door of the café."
::"Secondly, don't come looking for me. You'll never find me, but I will always be watching you and all of your secrets. Finally, if you dare to report this to the matra, there will be consequences."
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Hmm...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (From Cyno's description, it sounds like the threat letter didn't come in an envelope. It was simply written on a crude piece of paper, and left for Cyrus to find.)
:{{DIcon}} The paper?
::{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 11a 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Very good. The paper has a rather rough texture. It's not the typical kind you see in most books.
::{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 09a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Another thing is, some of these strokes look kinda blurry... Could there be an issue with the ink?
::{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 11a 2.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Possibly. And I bet the paper has something to do with it.
:{{DIcon}} The ink?
::{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 11b 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes. Some of the strokes are blurry.
::{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 09b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So is there something wrong with the ink?
::{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 11b 2.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Possibly. And I bet the paper has something to do with it.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 spantamadcyrus 08.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Most of the paper around here is much smoother than this, and the ink is absorbed quickly so it doesn't run. This paper, meanwhile... It's very coarse grained. Almost as if it's... made from some sort of plant matter?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's certainly not the same paper as we use in the Akademiya. But the ink is nothing special. Just regular black ink, that gets a blue tinge when applied to paper.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... So do we think the culprit has a connection with the Akademiya, or not?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait! Check this out. Looks like this part got wet at some point.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Agreed. The staining suggests it was a colored liquid, not plain water. It also looks like it was wiped off with a damp cloth.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A colored liquid? So... tea? Wine?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 3 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Looks like we're thinking along similar lines. Let's go talk to Aarav &mdash; there are some things I'll need him to take care of.

;(Approach Aarav)
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Aarav, Aarav... Ah, there he is.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 01.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Mahamatra Cyno, Sir Cyrus. Ah, and {{Traveler}} and Paimon. It's been a while.
:{{Black Screen|Cyno briefs Aarav on the case...}}
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...As such, I'm inclined to believe that the culprit in this case is a student at the Akademiya. Somebody young, and strapped for cash.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Oh, one last thing. I'd start your investigation by taking a look at the cafes in the city.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, of course! You think the culprit spilled their coffee on the letter, huh?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' They do look like coffee stains to me.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Also, if I'm not mistaken, the letter is written on a type of scented paper that has aromatics added during the manufacturing process. The kind often provided as writing material for customers in cafes and taverns.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ahh, of course... Yes, like they sell in the gift shops. I remember now, [[Zaha Hadi]] bought some a while back. She said she was going to use it as wrapping paper for a vase.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 02.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Understood. I'll assemble a team to investigate the points of interest immediately.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You have my gratitude.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' One last thing: Send some matra to guard the entrances and exits of Sumeru City. And change into plain clothes &mdash; don't let them see you coming.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 03.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Will do.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great thinking, Cyno! So... Where do we think the culprit's at right now?
:{{DIcon}} I doubt they'd go back to the cafe.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... They've probably been lying low at home, waiting to see how Cyrus reacts...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hm, you're right, Paimon.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Which part?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The culprit's approach.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Whatever happens, they need this Mora. But just because they warned Professor Cyrus not to go to the matra doesn't mean they know what he'll do next. So like you said, they need to wait and see.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' And crucially, the culprit said they'd be watching the professor's every move.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, are you saying...
:{{Color|menu|Cyno suddenly walks toward a nearby bookshelf, stopping a student who is pretending to read...}}
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eek!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Found you.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 urraca 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Argh! Wh&mdash;What are you doing!?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You wrote the threat letter.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 urraca 02.ogg}} '''???:''' I&mdash;I don't know what you're talking about! What threat letter?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I sensed someone was watching us from the shadows the moment we entered the [[House of Daena]]. You managed to stay relatively well hidden for someone reckless enough to threaten Professor Cyrus.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There are a lot of people here, but we were looking specifically for Aarav. Whoever followed us the whole way was likely to be the culprit.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 urraca 03.ogg}} '''???:''' I&mdash;I was just listening in, that's all! ...You know something big's going down when Mahamatra Cyno shows up! Right? So I got a little curious, what's the big deal?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You smiled when Aarav left. I saw it as clear as day.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 urraca 04.ogg}} '''???:''' Is smiling a crime now!?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There are coffee stains on the letter. You mixed some coffee with water, gently smeared it onto the paper, then wiped it off with a wet cloth. All to create the impression that the letter was written at a cafe.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Closing off the exits to the city doesn't affect you, because you already live here. And as long as the matra were focused on the cafes, you would be free from scrutiny.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 17.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The cafe was a red herring all along. You had to be somewhere where you could monitor the professor's movements.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 urraca 05.ogg}} '''???:''' You can't pin this on me! I haven't done anything!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 18.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Really? Then why are you shaking like a leaf?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 19.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The innocent have no reason to fear the matra. But you...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 20.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Your heart's racing, and your eyelids are twitching. You're a terrible liar.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 urraca 06.ogg}} '''???:''' ...I would never&mdash;
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 21.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Don't try anything, or you'll pay the price. Now, come with me.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that was over quickly. Cyno already caught the guy...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You're telling me! One minute I go out for a quick smoke, the next minute I see Aarav, already on his way back to meet up with Cyno.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' *sigh*... Looked like a young guy, too. Couldn't have been much more than thirty. But after what he's done, I'm afraid he's ruined his whole future.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 22.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Everyone, it's all over.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gosh, that was so fast!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 23.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The culprit's name is [[Urraca]]. A sixteen-year-old student in the [[Rtawahist]] [[Darshan]].
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...Huh!?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sixteen!? Cyrus thought he looked thirty-something...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 24.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We checked his records. He's sixteen. A third-year student.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' But... he looks so old...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, seriously!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 08.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' *sigh* Foolish child... He's too young for the criminal life. What the devil drove him down this path?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 04.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' We questioned the culprit regarding his motives. He, umm...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 09.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh, just spit it out. Nothing can surprise me at this point.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 05.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Very well. It's our understanding that Urraca is a mediocre student who has been underperforming in his classes. He started taking extra tutoring to improve his grades, but developed a gambling habit around the same time and lost a lot of Mora.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 06.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Down on his luck, he went to the tavern for a drink, and overheard some people chatting about Sir Cyrus's comfortable retirement. They mentioned that he's always arguing about his tomato plants with some old woman on the street...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 10.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' "Some old woman on the street"? Goodness gracious, has that rascal attended a single one of his classes? That "old woman" is [[Kshahrewar]]'s very own Professor Zaha Hadi! How can he not know who Zaha Hadi is?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 25.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Is this going somewhere?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 11.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh! Right, yes, umm... So another thing &mdash; we don't just argue about tomato plants... And what are they trying to insinuate by "comfortable retirement"? A man grows a few vegetables, and suddenly he's living a life of luxury?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 26.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Maybe it's more the fact that you have the time to grow vegetables in the first place.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 07.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Urraca mentioned he'd heard a rumor, alleging that Sir Cyrus illegally obtained a large sum of money from the desert before retiring, and kept it for himself instead of reporting it to the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 08.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Urraca believes this money to be the reason why Sir Cyrus hasn't kept up with any academic research or other projects since his retirement... And given your advanced age, he thought that you'd be an easy target to blackmail.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 12.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh, Urraca... I'm at a loss for words. I'm so angry I don't know where to start!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 27.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' People make up rumors all the time. I am quite confident that Professor Cyrus has never embezzled a Mora in his life.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 13.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Aarav, you'll have to find an excuse to interrogate Urraca again later. I need you to deliver a few firm fistfuls to him on my behalf.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 09.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' I completely understand how you feel, Sir Cyrus. But I'm afraid that course of action goes against the matra's principles.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 28.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Professor, there's no need to be childish about this.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 14.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh come on, I was clearly joking.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, okay... Where does this go from here?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 29.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The Akademiya will determine the appropriate disciplinary action against the student. And as for the individuals spreading rumors about the professor's obsession with tomatoes and some old woman on the street... There could be a slander case here. The matra will continue to investigate.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 15.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Who said I'm obsessed with some old woman on the street!? Mind your wording, or you'll start a whole new rumor!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 16.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...You seem confused. Haha, don't you understand?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 17.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Urraca is just a young boy who made a very rash and very stupid decision based on some groundless rumor he heard. Besides, I didn't actually hand over any Mora to him. The whole thing sounds a lot worse than it is.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 18.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' All it's cost me is a little reputational damage, that's all.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 30.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Please rest assured, Professor, that the Akademiya will issue a fair and reasonable punishment.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 19.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Yes, I have no doubt about that.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 20.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' But as a former educator, I'd still like to have a serious conversation with the boy's parents. The family lives in the city, yes?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 31.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Correct.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 10.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' We looked into the family. Both parents are merchants, and they're often away on business. They've never taken much of an active role in their children's lives.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 21.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' *sigh* What a mess...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 22.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You don't have to seal the evidence away yet, do you? I'd like to have that letter back for the time being, if possible. I'll need something concrete for when I talk to the family tonight.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 23.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' We have to show them how serious this situation is!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 11.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' The relevant authorities have already reviewed the evidence and are now discussing Urraca's punishment. You can hold onto the letter for now &mdash; just make sure to return it within a couple of days.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 24.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh! So you'll be able to close the case in two days?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 32.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Give or take. Cases like this are quick to resolve.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 25.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Very good. Well, thank you all for your help &mdash; perhaps we can all go for a meal together? My treat, of course.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 aarav 12.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' My apologies, Sir Cyrus, but I have a prior commitment. Enjoy the meal, everyone.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 26.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ah, I see... well, that's a pity. But Cyno, you have to come. You found the culprit at record speed, and I owe you for that.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 27.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ah &mdash; and isn't Tighnari in town at the moment? Bring him along too.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you mean Tighnari's in the city?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 33.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' He is. Tighnari's master, Sir [[Naphis]], called him and Collei to the Akademiya to help out on a project. They should be at Naphis's office at this hour.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 cyno 34.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Though I must say, I'm surprised you're extending the invitation to Tighnari... Did you do something to offend Sir Naphis?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 28.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Don't be outrageous. Naphis offends me all the time &mdash; it's never the other way round.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 29.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Anyway, hurry up and fetch Tighnari. I'll head over to [[Lambad's Tavern|the tavern]] with {{Traveler}} and Paimon. See you there.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 4 spantamadcyrus 30.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Go on, now. Don't keep us waiting.
----
;(Enter Lambad's Tavern)
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Not to brag, but we never had problems like this at Rtawahist back when I was still teaching... And if you don't want to take my word for it, you can ask them.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' They were students at the time, they'll tell you what it was like. Won't they?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I was out in the forest at least four days a week back then, thanks to a colossal workload from Master. It wrought havoc on my poor tail... So, I didn't exactly keep up to date with what was going on at the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Most of what I know, I heard from Cyno after the fact.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Professor's become a lot more laid-back in his retirement. He used to be far stricter, and was especially known for being extremely principled.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Wow... It's hard enough to stay true to your principles as a normal person. I can't imagine doing that as a sage...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' It's a pity Collei wasn't around at the time... I would have happily taken her on as a student.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' And then we'd have one more person who has to address Lisa as "upperclasswoman"...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Can't you just call her "Lisa"...? She seems to prefer it when people treat her like an older sister.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh, believe me... Back when she was a student, nothing made her happier than the younger students acknowledging her seniority.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! More food! Are you sure about this? We don't wanna take advantage...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hahaha, don't worry about it! Order whatever you like, and if it's not enough, order some more! After all your help today, treating you to dinner is the least I can do.
:{{Color|menu|As everyone chats, a familiar face makes an appearance...}}
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I thought I heard some familiar voices. Ah, and Sir Cyrus is here as well...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh, Kaveh! It's been a while. Zaha Hadi was talking about you last month. How have you been?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I've been alright, thank you. You're looking very well, Sir. I'm glad to see it.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Have you eaten yet? Care to join us?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' That's awfully kind of you, but I had a late lunch, so I'm not really hungry just yet. I'll have dinner a little bit later tonight.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I just came to Lambad's to buy some wine, and when I heard some voices I recognized, I thought I'd come and say hello.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' So what's the occasion, anyway? Some sort of celebration?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 08.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ugh, consolation, more like... You wouldn't believe the day I've had...
:{{Black Screen|Cyrus vividly recounts the day's events for the benefit of those who weren't there to witness it...}}
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...Sounds like things have really gone downhill since I was there. In my whole time as a student, I've never heard of anything remotely like that.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I can't believe how young the guy is... *sigh* What are his parents going to think?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 09.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Young people are always more susceptible to making rash and ill-advised decisions. Their minds are still developing. It's just an unfortunate fact of life.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 10.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' But still! This boy has some nerve, just look at what he wrote! It makes my blood boil!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Wow, yeah... Geez...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' "I will always be watching you and all of your secrets..." And then he just followed you into the House of Daena?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 11.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' If this were my son, oh, he'd get the scolding of a lifetime! Hmph!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Luckily, I'm also an extremely principled person.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 lambad 01.ogg}} '''Lambad:''' Kaveh! Your order's ready, Sir!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ah, coming!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'll have to get going. Have a nice evening, everyone &mdash; I'll catch you all another time.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, bye-bye!
:{{Color|menu|Kaveh walks downstairs as he responds...}}
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Here I am. The coffee beans are in here too?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 lambad 02.ogg}} '''Lambad:''' Yep, it's all there.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 12.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' I'll stop babbling away now. Let's eat before the food gets cold.
<!--:{{Color|menu|Luckily, it's still hot, and you enjoy a delicious celebratory meal after a crazy day.}}-->
:{{Black Screen|You were all busy chatting that you almost forgot about the food.}}
:{{Black Screen|Luckily, it's still hot, and you enjoy a delicious celebratory meal after a crazy day.}}
<!-- black screen screen transition -->
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 13.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Phew...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Too tasty... Paimon's belly is about to explode...
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 14.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Haha, mine too. I'll have to walk home to burn some of it off.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Thanks for dinner, Sir Cyrus! Master Tighnari and I will bring you some home-made herbal tea next time. It'll do wonders for your sleep.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 15.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Well, I look forward to that! In fact, could I trouble you to bring a little extra, for the other old folks on my street? I'll be the envy of the neighborhood!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' No problem at all. I'll pack some up and bring it over.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you for treating us!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 16.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ah. I'll see you all later! I'd better head home now and tend to the crops.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Good night, Professor. Don't let those tomatoes keep you up too late.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 17.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hey! My tomatoes are serious business! I am not about to be beaten by Zaha Hadi!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 spantamadcyrus 18.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Anyway, I'll be leaving now. Don't stay up too late now, children. I bid you all a good night.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Take care! Have a safe trip home!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright. Now, we finally have some "us time."
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you mean, "us time"?
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Well, I was talking with Tighnari and Collei, and since we all have some free time, we thought we could all go camping together. Think of it as our way of welcoming you back to Sumeru.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Camping!? That sounds fun, Paimon's in!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, that sounds really fun!
::{{A|vo cnlq101 5 collei 05a 1.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Right? It's been so long since we did something fun together. I can't wait!
:{{DIcon}} Time to show off my tent-pitching skills!
::{{A|vo cnlq101 5 collei 05b 1.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Wait, no, that's my job! Don't take it away from me... Why don't you and Paimon help out Master, or Cyno?
::{{A|vo cnlq101 5 collei 05b 2.ogg}} '''Collei:''' You don't have to play the hero when you're out with us! This is your chance to just... y'know, laze around and switch off for a bit.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Everyone, let's meet tomorrow afternoon at the riverbank to the southeast of [[Gandharva Ville]].
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' No need to bring anything &mdash; we've already packed everything for the trip. Just bring your delightful selves and prepare to have some fun.
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You got it! We'll be there!
:{{A|vo cnlq101 5 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Great. Then we'll see you tomorrow.
