The '''Cryo Archon''' is the [[Archon]] who presides over [[Snezhnaya]], the land of [[Cryo]].

Currently, only the [[Tsaritsa]], the current title-bearer, has been detailed. However, given that only [[Barbatos]] and [[Morax]] remain of the original members of [[The Seven]], the Tsaritsa is at least the second holder of the Cryo Archon title.
