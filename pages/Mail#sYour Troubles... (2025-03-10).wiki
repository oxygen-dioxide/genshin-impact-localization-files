|text      = Not long ago, two guest dined at [[Wanmin Restaurant]]. As they were leaving, the lady tearfully said to the gentleman, "A relationship that only shares joy but not hardship is like the shifting sands of [[Sumeru]]..."

At first, I didn't fully understand what she meant. But after observing the companions around me, I realized that close family members don't just talk about happy things.

[[Xiangling]] often complains to [[Chef Mao]] about the challenges of cooking, and [[Xianyun|Master]] always reminds me to share my troubles with her when I'm away from home.

I hope we can reach that level of closeness too. So, please tell me your worries. I'll listen carefully and if needed, I'll do everything I can to help.

As for my own troubles... well, I'll share them with you when we meet.
