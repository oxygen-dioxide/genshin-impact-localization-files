==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Anaka:''' Mommy said that kids can't go on long trips, and forbade me from going with Daddy to [[Petrichor]]... Am I being too good a kid?
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Anaka:''' I'm Anaka! Do you play music well? I love all things music!
::'''Anaka:''' Daddy's an awesome, awesome scholar, and music's part of his research!
::'''Anaka:''' He says that he'll bring me back a gift from Petrichor... Although what I really wanted was to go out there with him...
:{{DIcon}} Petrichor?
::'''Anaka:''' Petrichor's on the other side of this sea, and it's a town full of "music." I'd so love to go there, even if it was only in my dreams.
::'''Anaka:''' Daddy took the boat over to that town, and Uncle Giustino also took a boat to come over here.
::'''Anaka:''' I'm the only one bumming about here. Gah, it's so boring...
::'''Anaka:''' Uncle Giustino's told me that kids in Fontaine can ride an aquabus and even listen to music beneath the waves. Is is true?
;(Before completing [[Latecoming Homecoming]])
::{{DIcon}} Yes, but...
::'''Anaka:''' Ah, Mommy also does that a lot! Y'know, starting the second half of her sentence with "but."
::'''Anaka:''' I wish I could tell her that you can mess with kids... but only up to a point.
;(After completing [[Latecoming Homecoming]])
::{{DIcon}} Giustino sometimes tells fibs too.
::'''Anaka:''' Oh, so you know him too? Has he tricked you, then?
::'''Anaka:''' Huh. I didn't think he was a fibber... He seems like a good person to me.
::'''Anaka:''' I guess there's just a whole bunch of things in this world that we kids don't get.
::'''Anaka:''' Still, why would Uncle Giustino have come over here if Petrichor was so awesome...?
:{{DIcon}} You should always listen to your Mom.
::'''Anaka:''' ...Alright. Ah, if only I could wake up tomorrow and be old enough to travel already.
