==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ashshab:''' *sigh* I asked [[Hazm|Mr. Hazm]] about my term paper and got just a glare from him again...
:'''Jaleh:''' Was it the same question you asked him about last time?
:'''Ashshab:''' Yeah, I have adjusted the lighting conditions, but I still can't get the desired outcome.
:'''Ashshab:''' When I asked him, he just said something like "You ran too far. You should go back and check!"...
:'''Ashshab:''' But as I've confirmed over and over again, the original idea couldn't meet the requirement on the fruits' sweetness.
:'''Jaleh:''' I think you might have misunderstood...
:'''Jaleh:''' Is it possible that there's something wrong with your projections?
:'''Ashshab:''' Huh? Are you saying it was all wrong from the start!?
