'''Errors''' occur in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' when an action or operation does not complete or is executed incorrectly, if an illegal action or operation is attempted or if something in the game's status is incorrect or different from what is expected. Errors can be caused by a variety of different reasons, such as invalid actions, network issues, cheats/hacks, exploits, bugs, technical issues, and the like.

==Types==
There are three types of errors that can occur in ''Genshin Impact'': overlay message errors, dialog errors, and critical errors.

Overlay message errors are delivered to the player in the form of either white text that appears on the top half of the screen that disappears after a short period of time or white text in a dark gray box in the middle of the screen that disappears after a short period of time and can be dismissed earlier by clicking anywhere, causing almost no impact on gameplay.

Dialog errors open up a dialog box in the middle of the screen that requires the user to click a button to perform an action that is required to solve the error or to close the dialog box to continue.

Critical errors will quit the game with the error message.

==Overlay Message Errors==
{|class="article-table sortable"
!Error!!Description
|-
|Controller connection error, please reconnect your controller, or restart the game to exit controller control scheme.
|Occurs when the player's controller disconnects, either by loss of battery power or by unplugging the controller. The message will persist until the controller is reconnected successfully.
|-
|Wish schedule inconsistent
|Occurs when the player attempts to [[Wish]] on a limited-time banner that has already ended. Banners do not automatically disappear from a player's screen after their duration ends if the player is currently on the respective banner's screen; they will disappear after the player closes out of the Wish screen and opens it again.
|-
|Waypoint unlocked''<!-- Does this mean that there's also an error if you attempt to reactivate a Statue of The Seven, the Frostbearing Tree or even the Skyfrost Nail? -->
|Occurs when the player attempts to reunlock a [[Teleport Waypoint]] that has already been unlocked. Normally this is impossible, however due to things like network latency or network errors, the player may be able to attempt to reunlock a Teleport Waypoint that has already been unlocked. This is different from the ''Teleport Waypoint unlocked'' message; when a waypoint is unlocked for the first time, it will show a ''Teleport Waypoint unlocked'' message, while when the player attempts to reunlock an already unlocked Teleport Waypoint, ''Waypoint unlocked'' will show.
|-
|Cannot discard item
|Occurs when the player attempts to discard an item that is not discardable, such as [[Stone of Remembrance|Stones of Remembrance]], [[Slime-Swallowed Calla Lily|Slime-Swallowed Calla Lilies]], [[Everlasting Incense]]s, which are [[:Category:Quest Items|Quest Items]].
|-
|Invalid item amount to use
|Occurs when the player attempts to use an illegal or uninterpretable amount of an item, use a larger amount of an item than what the player owns, a negative amount of items, etc.
|-
|Recipe does not exist
|Occurs when the player attempts to cook a [[Cooking]] recipe that does not exist.
|-
|Max proficiency not reached. Cannot auto-cook.
|Occurs when the player attempts to execute an auto-cook operation on a recipe for which they have not reached maximum proficiency required to unlock auto-cook on.
|-
|This Mechanicus cannot be rotated
|Occurs when the player attempts to rotate a [[Theater Mechanicus#Mechanici|Mechanicus]] that is not a Veneficus Mechanicus: Dust Devil. Normally, only Veneficus Mechanicus: Dust Devil can be rotated, however if a rotate operation is erroneously sent to another Mechanicus, this error will occur.
|-
|Entity has timed out and disappeared
|Occurs when the player attempts to interact with something that can no longer be interacted with, most of the time due to already having interacted with it, such as [[Firefly|fireflies]], [[chests]], [[Crystalflies]], and [[butterflies]].
|-
|Character-switching in cooldown
|Occurs when the player attempts to switch character while the 1 second [[cooldown]] between switching characters is in effect.
|-
|Cannot switch character while aiming<!-- These error messages could probably get merged (e.g. Cannot switch character while climbing/jumping/swimming/gliding) -->
|Occurs when the player attempts to switch character while [[Bows#Charged Attacks|aiming]].
|-
|Cannot switch character while climbing
|Occurs when the player attempts to switch character while [[climbing]].
|-
|Cannot switch character while gliding
|Occurs when the player attempts to switch character while [[gliding]] or while performing a Plunging Attack.
|-
|Cannot switch character while jumping
|Occurs when the player attempts to switch character while [[jumping]] or during the frames of [[Keqing]]'s [[Elemental Skill]], [[Stellar Restoration]], when it is used twice in a row (the first time to hurl the Lightning Stiletto and the second time to blink to its location and unleash a slashing attack) where she is unleashing a slashing attack. The game counts falling as a result of jumping as jumping (e.g., attempting to switch character while falling after dashing then jumping off a cliff).
|-
|Cannot switch character while swimming
|Occurs when the player attempts to switch character while [[swimming]].
|-
|Cannot switch character now
|Occurs when the player attempts to switch character while falling normally (see ''Cannot switch character while jumping'' and ''Cannot switch to target character'' sections), while landing after falling (normally this is indistinguishable from simply falling, however due to the complications from falling because of an Elemental Skill, they are different; see ''Cannot switch character while jumping'' and ''Cannot switch to target character'' sections) or after performing a Plunging Attack, while their active character is in the final frames of the climbing animation (the ones where their active character hoists themselves up onto something), while the player is in a [[Spiral Abyss]] chamber before actually starting the battle or while there is an animation playing for an [[Elemental Skill]]. This is especially noticeable when the player attempts to switch character while holding an [[Elemental Skill]] that can be held, such as two of the [[Traveler]]'s [[Elemental Skill]]s, [[Palm Vortex]] and [[Starfell Sword]].<!-- There are probably other things that can make this error occur. If you find any more, please add them. -->
|-
|Cannot switch to target character
|Occurs when the player attempts to switch character while falling due to an [[Elemental Skill]] (for example, if the player uses [[Albedo]]'s [[Elemental Skill]], [[Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma]], to create a Solar Isotoma and then stands at the locus of the Solar Isotoma, a crystallized platform will form, lifting the player up. If the player then reuses [[Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma]] to create a Solar Isotoma at a different location, the player will fall, and attempting to switch character while doing so will cause this error to occur. Similarly, using [[Keqing]]'s [[Elemental Skill]], [[Stellar Restoration]] to blink upwards and then attempting to switch character while falling, and therefore after performing the slashing attack; see ''Cannot switch character while jumping'' section, will cause this error to occur), when the player's active character is clipped inside something, such as a wall, or when switching would cause the player to clip inside something (for example, if the roof of a building is just high enough that a short character, such as [[Diona]], can fit under it, but a tall one, such as [[Diluc]], cannot, attempting to switch character from [[Diona]] to [[Diluc]] would cause this error to occur. This last scenario will also cause this error to occur if done in the Party Setup menu.)<!-- There are probably other actions that trigger this error message -->
|-

|-
