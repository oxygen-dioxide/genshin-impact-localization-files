'''Falling Leaves''' is [[Kaedehara Kazuha]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Kazuha's hair is tied in an off-center ponytail to his right.

Kazuha's outfit consists of a gray short-sleeved kimono, a black {{w|Haori|''haori''}} coat, red {{w|Hakama|''hakama''}} pants with maple leaf designs, and black sandals with dark red tights and black leg plating. Half of his ''haori'' coat is worn normally on his left arm, with a flowy orange sleeve decorated with orange and red maple leaves, while the other half is draped behind his waist and secured by an {{w|Obi (belt)|''obi''}} belt on top. He also wears a black and red scarf with gold accents, and a slanted belt that goes under his right arm and over his left shoulder, where his {{Anemo}} [[Vision]] is pinned behind. His Vision is tied to a red tassel decoration and is near samurai shoulder plating.

Kazuha also wears black glove plates that protect the backs of his hands and his left forearm. His right hand is bandaged, possibly to protect against injuries from constant sword use.<!-- it is NOT due to his friend's Vision "burning" him unless the bandages shown on Kazuha's hand when he was next to his friend in Follow the Wind were a mistake -->
