'''Coral Butterfly''' is a type of creature that can be purchased from the [[Teapot Traveling Salesman]].

It could first be found throughout the map of [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]] during [[Version 2.5]]. When captured, it replenished the [[Bokuso Box]]' energy and gave 1 [[Crystal Core]]. It could also be captured via the [[Omni-Ubiquity Net]] to be an outdoor pet for the [[Serenitea Pot]].
