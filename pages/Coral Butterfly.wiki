|description = The Sangacorexes' migratory patterns resemble those of butterflies.<br>When they have almost converted the rampaging elemental energies in a certain area, the bone structure of the next generation of Sangacorex will condense into wings of a sort. They will then fly through [[Enkanomiya]], searching for a new place to live, grow, and multiply.<br>They were once destroyers of the old order, only capable of living while concealed in the [[Dark Sea]].<br>And there they would have stayed, had the [[Orobashi|serpent god]] not given them another opportunity.

'''Coral Butterflies''', also known as '''Sangacorallia'''<ref name="TRGOe">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref> or '''Sangacorexes''', are a type of crystalfly that could be found throughout the map of [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]] (in Enkanomiya) during [[Version 2.5]]. When captured, they replenished the [[Bokuso Box]]'s energy and gave 1 [[Crystal Core]].

According to [[Tsumi]], the fundamental purpose of the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]] is to use Orobashi's life force to awaken the Sangacorallia, which are its second familiars (the first being the [[Vassals of Watatsumi]]). This causes a transformation in the ecological environment of Enkanomiya.<ref name="TRGOe" />
