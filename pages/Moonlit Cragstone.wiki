|description  = A stone that gives off a strange radiance. It can only be found in a separate part of The Chasm, and its origins and composition are both unknown. However, it has strange and unique properties: When it falls, it maintains a regular shape and its cross-section still keeps its mirrored sheen. Those of these rocks that are older may have witnessed that ancient battle.<br />These stones can be exchanged for treasures during "Perilous Trail."
