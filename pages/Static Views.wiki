==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Paimon found a painting in Vanarana that could be a treasure map...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the mailbox)
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see... Hmm? Is this an Aranara painting...?
:{{DIcon}} It's rude to tamper around...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Who knows how many adventurer camps and treasure chests we have rummaged through!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's put it this way. We didn't see Aranara anywhere near the house, and we were worried, so we'd rather see if there were any leads. We might even help some trapped Aranara!
:{{DIcon}} You're right.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm. That makes total sense.
:'''Paimon:''' Of course! Anyway, seems like the painting depicts some views near here, right? Ah, maybe it's a treasure map...
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, we should go to the spot shown in the painting! Maybe we'll find some treasure left by the Aranara!

:'''Paimon:''' Treasure~ Treasure~
:'''Paimon:''' Ahem, Paimon means... "possibly trapped Aranara," we're coming to help!

----
;(Dig at the location in the dream Mahavanaranapna, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Paimon doesn't see any treasure...
:'''Paimon:''' No, wait. Maybe it's because we are in the "Vanarana in the dream." If we do return to reality, then there should be treasure!

;(Dig at the location in reality and open the chest)
:'''Paimon:''' There really is treasure! It is a treasure map!
:'''Paimon:''' Hurry, let's go back to that house. Who knows, there might be more treasure maps!

;(Go back to Aranara's cabin)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Let's take a look. It seems like a new treasure map!
:{{DIcon}} Aren't we going to help "the trapped Aranara"?
:'''Paimon:''' Ahem! We haven't found the house owner. This is worrying! So, {{Traveler}}, why don't we check some other places shown in the painting?
:'''Paimon:''' After we get there, we could...
:{{DIcon}} Find more treasure?
::'''Paimon:''' Yes! Wait, Paimon means... no! Find the trapped Aranara!
:{{DIcon}} Find "the trapped Aranara"?
::'''Paimon:''' Yes! We might even find some treasure!
:'''Paimon:''' And what an interesting "mailbox." It may receive some new paintings later. We should keep an eye on it!
:;(Quest completes)

;(View the mailbox)
:'''Paimon:''' Paintings~ Aranara paintings~ Lead us to the treasure~♪
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... This picture is different from the previous ones! It has more Aranara in it...<!--May have unknown prerequisite to trigger this line-->
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go treasure-hunting, {{Traveler}}!
