|text    = In this ancient ballad, the [[Erinnyes|knight]] searching for water most pure encountered the spirit here, and they embarked upon a journey of redemption together. A thousand years pass like a dewy dawn, and whether laughter or tears, joy or sorrow, it all turns into a whirling illusory dance, disappearing into a sea of applause.
