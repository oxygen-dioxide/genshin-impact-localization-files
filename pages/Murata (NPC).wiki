==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing [[Festive Elegance]])
:'''Murata:''' This is the official [[Yae Publishing House]] booth, but we're still setting it all up. We'll only open once the Irodori Festival starts.

;(After completing [[The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture (Quest)|The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture]])
:'''Murata:''' Here's the official Yae Publishing House stall! Come check it out!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'm looking to buy some books.
::'''Murata:''' Take your pick! We've got all sorts of new books here at the Irodori Festival!
:;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} How's the festival going?
:;(Before completing [[The Five Colors' True Form]])
:::'''Murata:''' This Irodori Festival is different from ones in years past. I imagine that it's quite the sight for our guests.
:::'''Murata:''' That said, I'm just here to collect the Mora, give out the change, thank people for their patronage... the works.
:::'''Murata:''' Ah, sorry, no time for chit-chat. If Hirayama catches me, I'll be in hot stew for sure!
:;(After completing The Five Colors' True Form)
:::'''Murata:''' Oh, things have been going quite smoothly. Everyone in the editorial team has finally been able to heave a sigh of relief.
:::'''Murata:''' Although the release event has ended, the festival will continue for a while more. I believe that there's also ongoing ikebana and Theater Mechanicus events...
:::'''Murata:''' I'd have gone to take part in them myself if I didn't have to stay here to watch the booth.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Murata:''' Yes, please come again!
