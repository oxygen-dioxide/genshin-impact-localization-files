|text    = Ever since we parted, I still think of you from time to time. Recently, I discovered a new trail, which turns into a sea of pink when the flowers bloom. You can see fireworks from there, and there are snack shops nearby... If you have time, I would like to invite you for a stroll.

You're probably tending to something important at this moment, right? Every day we move forward towards our goals, each step must be more steadfast than the previous... Only then will we be able to reach them.

There must be something in this world that only you can achieve. The same goes for me, so I must stand my ground and do my duty to the best of my ability.

Please don't push yourself {{sic|to hard}}. Do take care of yourself and [[Paimon]].

[[Traveler]], if I may be so bold...

This may be a little sudden, but I would like to see you today.

If you don't mind, please meet me under the Sakura Tree tonight. The moonlight is beautiful during this time of the year, and I would love to admire it with you.
