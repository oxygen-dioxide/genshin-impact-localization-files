They look like a flower bud held up by leaves and just about ready to bloom.<br />It is said that the placement of every light in the House of Daena was strictly planned based on research on the influence of light on human mood, with the aim to get scholars and students immersed in their readings and reaching an optimal uninterrupted state as soon as possible.
