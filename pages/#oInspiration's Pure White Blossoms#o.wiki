|description    = A type of potted plant that can be found in Petrichor, with simple, pure white blossoms. According to legend, these flowers are widely cultivated by the townspeople for their elegance and beauty. A certain playwright once wrote a story about these flowers. In the story, the protagonist is unexpectedly inspired by these white flowers and creates the variety of bells large and small now used all over Petrichor today.<br>For this reason, these pure white blossoms not only signify their own beauty, but also symbolize "inspiration."
