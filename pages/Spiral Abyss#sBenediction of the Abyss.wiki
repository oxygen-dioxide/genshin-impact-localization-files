Before challenging a chamber, the Benediction of the Abyss screen will pop up. Players can choose 1 of 3 buffs to take with them to challenge either the chamber or the floor. If the player chooses a benediction that is effective for the floor, it will remain active for the remaining chambers and stack with any benedictions chosen in later chambers. The selection of benedictions refreshes every day at server reset, provided that the player has abandoned any ongoing challenges from a previous day.
