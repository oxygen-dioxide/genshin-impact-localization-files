==Description==
It was a time when the [[Abyss|turbid black tide]] still lingered on the horizon, yet after the [[Heroes of Natlan|six heroes]] of the blazing sun had stepped into the night winds.<br>
Silent currents of avarice surged between the fractured tribes, an insidious lust for power and ambition stirring throughout the land like a pestilent scourge.<br>
Some coveted the authority left in the lingering embers' wake, while others conspired to claim the tribes for their own,<br>
As if they had forgotten the calamity that still loomed tall as a mountain, trampling down the last remnants of life in this land.

"You possess neither the wit to turn back to the past, nor the courage to look toward tomorrow."<br>
"You ants who creep in the shadows, what right have you to even speak of the empty yoke left behind by a god?"<br>
"Now the throne sits vacant, all you can think of is taking it for your own."<br>
"But have you ever looked up to behold the suffering that yet sweeps across this [[Natlan|scorched land]]?"

As the tribes quarreled on, it was [[Fietena|a girl]] who had once stood silently in [[Wanjiru]]'s shadow that burst into the council chamber.<br>
This birth-daughter of [[Collective of Plenty|the Collective]], now married into the [[Flower-Feather Clan]], drove a half-broken bone blade deep into the long table's center as she glared at her stunned audience.<br>
And just like that, wooden shards scattering like sparks, the tumultuous struggle for succession was brought to an end; and in accordance with their ancient alliance,<br>
The tribes set aside all their disputes &mdash; before they were dragged under by the turbid black tide &mdash; to unite against the unforgivable foe.<br>
Should [[Sacred Flame|divine infernos]] be quenched, the braziers of heroes be extinguished, then let mortals rekindle the faintest sparks in their stead;<br>
For even if their fate was to give battle in vain and burn like a rainbow, they must pave the way for the "heroes" of tomorrow.

Fietena, who had never received an [[Ancient Name]], nor been expected to rise a hero,<br>
The girl who had once huddled by campfires, listening intently as Wanjiru recounted heroic legends,<br>
Now donned a hero's mask, her hoarse voice rallying the tribes, each preparing for battle.<br>
She worked with [[Traore]], orphan of [[Nanatzcayan|the mines]], to carve through massive rocks, channeling molten lava into rivers to protect them all;<br>
And together with [[Nzambe]], a priest of [[Mictlan|the deep valleys]], she set a trap, unleashing a hurricane that ripped through that swamp of corruption.<br>
But in the end, a mortal is but a mortal. By the time the calamity finally waned, the withering tide had permeated her very bones.<br>
As the last shadow crumbled with a scream, the aged Fietena removed her mask,<br>
And this prop, with which she had played the "hero" for many years, she handed to [[Taika]], a young follower from the Flower-Feather Clan.

"It seems this was my final battle... Come now, no need to look so grim."<br>
"When the storm passes, a rainbow will shine; but remember, its false colors are but illusions in the mist."<br>
"Whether truly a hero or just acting the part, there will always come a day when it's your turn to bow out."<br>
"That is the way of the wrestler. But now, Taika, let this mask bear witness to the journey before you."
