The '''Fruity Order''' is a group of [[Treasure Hoarders]] operating in [[Fontaine]].

==Description==
The Fruity Order consists of an unnamed boss simply referred to as "the boss," Five Great Operatives with plant-related codenames, and several dozen other members. Betrayal is punishable by death. According to [["Trendy Zaytun Peach"]], the order exists to maintain order and balance in the world.<ref name="villains">{{Ref/Quest|Villains}}</ref>

Following the events of {{Quest|Villains}} and [[World Quest]] ''[[Questions and Answers]]'', only three of the Five Great Operatives remain, as both [["Tricky Bulle Fruit"]] and [["Intrepid Valberry"]] have left the order. They will appear as open-world NPCs in the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
