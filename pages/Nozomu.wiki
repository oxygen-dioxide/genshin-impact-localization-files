'''Nozumu''' was a member of [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]]'s entourage at [[Tatarasuna]], [[Inazuma]] who lived around 500 years ago.

Following the incident that resulted in [[Katsuragi]]'s death at Nagamasa's hands, Nozomu refused to abide by Nagamasa's order and dove into a furnace to rescue the nagamaki that they had forged. He died that night from his severe burn wounds.
