{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pepe:''' Tee-hee, do I do a good impression of [[Draff|Uncle Draff]] or what?
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
::'''Pepe:''' Running practice!
::'''Pepe:''' Uncle Draff says if you wanna be a hunter, the first step is being able to chase your prey. I can already catch up with the cats in the neighborhood!
::'''Pepe:''' But I'm still nowhere near as good as my dad. He runs so fast, he can catch anything!
:{{DIcon}} Where's your dad?
::'''Pepe:''' He went to chase a huuuge boar. It'll be ages and ages before he gets back.
::'''Pepe:''' I wanted to go and help my dad with the hunt, but Uncle Draff said I'm not big enough yet, I wouldn't be strong enough to be a hunter, and it would only make things worse if I went.
::'''Pepe:''' So I wanna grow up as fast as I can, learn how to hunt, and then I'll be able to help dad!
:{{DIcon}} That's the spirit! Good luck, bye!
::'''Pepe:''' I'm gonna be a great hunter one day, I just know it!
::'''Pepe:''' Then I can go help dad finally catch that boar!
