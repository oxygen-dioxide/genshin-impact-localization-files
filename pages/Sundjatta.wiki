'''Sundjatta''' was a historical figure from the [[Children of Echoes]] in [[Natlan]], and was one of the [[Heroes of Natlan|six warriors]] who joined forces with [[Tenoch]] in a war against the Abyss, alongside his [[Saurian#Historical|Stegosaurus]] companion Muhuru.<ref name="TS">{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref> He makes his first appearance in the form of a spiritual projection in the {{Quest|Despair Engulfs the Heavens}}.

Sundjatta bore the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name|BRK|'''Baraka'''|bearer=1}}, which has since been inherited in the present-day by [[Xilonen]]. Although it is unclear if Sundjatta possessed a vision, he was shown to have the ability to control the {{Geo}} element.<ref name="Sunset">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/aGtkhL8gDYE "Sunset" Animated Short]</ref>

Alongside being a warrior, Sundjatta was also a chief of the Children of Echoes, and a renowned warrior trainer.
