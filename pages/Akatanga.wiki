{{Dialogue Start}}
;Available after completing ''[[Lights, Kamera, Action!]]''
:'''Akatanga:''' Surely there's some other way we can use this set... Oh, hello there.
:{{DIcon}} What's up with the set?
::'''Akatanga:''' I'm wondering if there's any other way we can use it. It would be a bit of a shame if we just took it all down, don't you think?
::'''Akatanga:''' Making it available for other amateur filmmakers... might be an option, but I don't think that many people would be interested. Maybe it would be better if we prepared a few different scenes...
:{{DIcon}} About the film you've already made...
::'''Akatanga:''' Oh, well actually, the reviews were pretty good! Just... not everyone had the same opinion. A friend of mine, who went off to do her own thing... still hasn't changed her mind.
::'''Akatanga:''' I'm still not sure exactly what it was she didn't like... I was quite satisfied with how it all went myself...
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
::'''Akatanga:''' No worries, safe travels.
