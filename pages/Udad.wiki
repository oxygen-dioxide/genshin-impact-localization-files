==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Udad:''' Maybe too much studying makes one unable to speak plainly.
:{{DIcon}} Something on your mind?
::'''Udad:''' A little. It's not a big problem, but I'm still stressed.
::'''Udad:''' Like a few days ago, I heard some scholars in the [[Lambad's Tavern|tavern]] discussing something about a "grand conservator."
::'''Udad:''' So I asked them how much conservation is grand conservation, and they didn't seem to understand what I was asking.
::'''Udad:''' I'm a trustworthy battle-hardened veteran, yet the Parchamdar has to bail me out every time I try to talk to a scholar. It's pretty embarrassing...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps.
::'''Udad:''' Why can't they just spit it out?
