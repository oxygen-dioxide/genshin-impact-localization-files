==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zadith:''' There are so many [[Darshans]] in the [[Akademiya]]... Which one should I choose?
:{{DIcon}} What's troubling you?
::'''Zadith:''' *sigh* I'm worrying about which Darshan I should choose in the Akademiya.
::'''Zadith:''' My results were far better than I ever expected, so I met the requirements of all Darshans. But that brings me to another problem, there are six of them...
::'''Zadith:''' I heard becoming a doctor after graduating from [[Amurta]] pays very well, but then others say that it's easier to get employment after studying architecture in [[Kshahrewar]]...
::'''Zadith:''' Which one should I choose?
::{{DIcon}} Go to a fortune teller.
:::'''Zadith:''' Hahaha, you're really funny!
:::'''Zadith:''' ...You were kidding, right?
:::'''Zadith:''' No matter how difficult it may be, it's an important choice about my future career.
:::'''Zadith:''' If I make the wrong choice, I may drop out like [[Arezo]], or never be able to graduate like [[Hosseini]].
:::'''Zadith:''' I cannot end up like that!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Zadith:''' *sigh* I wouldn't be this conflicted if I met the requirements of only one Darshan...
