==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Esther:''' I never thought that I would see such a sight in Mondstadt...
:{{DIcon}} What are you mumbling about?
::'''Esther:''' Oh, hello. I'm an environmentalist and researcher of geography. I'm currently investigating the terrain here.
::'''Esther:''' To find a snow-capped mountain right here in Mondstadt, given the climate in the rest of the region, is really quite fascinating.
::'''Esther:''' I've seen similar circumstances elsewhere in the past, such as [[the Chasm]] in Liyue, so there may be some similarities in their respective terrain features...
::'''Esther:''' I wanted to go up the mountain to do some proper research, but I was stopped by that Knight of Favonius. A real spoilsport, that one.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} Tell me about this mountain...
::'''Esther:''' Oh, interested in Dragonspine, are you? Interesting. You might have some potential as a geographer...
::'''Esther:''' I became a researcher out of curiosity concerning the source of [[Springvale]]'s spring water &mdash; that source turned out to be the melting snow of Dragonspine.
::'''Esther:''' In order to study Dragonspine's environment more deeply, I prepared some [[Frostshield Potion]]s, but it turns out the cold here is so intense that even potions are useless against it...
::'''Esther:''' They serve no purpose with me, so I reckon that you should take them. They won't be enough to resist the cold here on Dragonspine, but they might be of use in your future adventures.
:;(Obtain [[Frostshield Potion]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Esther:''' Alright, take care now.
