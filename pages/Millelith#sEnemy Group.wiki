'''Millelith''' can be encountered in the [[Liyue]] [[Archon Quests]] as enemies. All of them attack the Traveler with their trademark spear. Despite appearing as enemies, [[Millelith]] cannot be found in the "Living Beings / Enemies and Monsters" section of the [[Archive]], likely due to the fact that there is no way to fight them outside of specific Archon Quests.

==Trivia==
*The Millelith and the [[Shogunate Samurai]] behave very similarly to each other. However the Shogunate appear much more frequently than the Millelith.
**This also makes the Millelith far rarer than the Shogunate as they are only fought twice in the Liyue Archon Quests while the Shogunate appear in [[World Quest]], [[Story Quest]], [[Commission|Commissions]], and even [[Events]].
