==Profile==
"Cyrus" served as a beast of burden for [[Tirzad]]'s archaeological team, having been rented out to them by [[Bonifaz]] before the events of ''[[Lost in the Sands]]''. Bonifaz is particularly worried about its safety. Like its fellow Sumpter Beasts, [["Dandelion"]] and {{LL|"Windwheel Aster"|,}} it is named after a fixture of [[Mondstadt]], though it is the only one named after an actual person. When the [[Traveler]] asks Bonifaz whether the real [[Cyrus]] knows about this, Bonifaz assures them that it will be fine as long as no one tells him.

After the conclusion of ''[[Golden Slumber]]'', it returns to Bonifaz's care and remains with him in Aaru Village.
