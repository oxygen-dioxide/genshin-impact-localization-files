{{Description|Walk this fiery ordeal with me and purge all impurity, just as a beast of flames that must descend from the blaze.}}
'''Molten Inferno''' is [[Dehya]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|cooldown|immediate}}
* {{Talent Note|particles|a coordinated attack|1}}
* {{Talent Note|snapshot|Field DMG|character=Dehya|snapshottime=when the field is deployed by Indomitable Flame, Ranging Flame, or [[Leonine Bite]] ending}}
* Molten Inferno mitigates DMG dealt by [[Transformative Reactions]] as well as [[True DMG]]. [[HP/HP Loss|HP Loss]] (e.g., Hu Tao's [[Guide to Afterlife]], Kuki Shinobu's [[Sanctifying Ring]], [[Fall Damage]], etc.) is not mitigated.
* Every time this skill mitigates DMG, the mitigated DMG will be added to the Redmane's Blood total. For the next 10 seconds, Dehya will take {{Color|True Physical DMG}} equal to 10% of Redmane's Blood's initial total every second and deduct the DMG taken from Redmane's Blood. If the skill mitigates DMG again during this period, the DoT will be reset and re-calculated based on Redmane's Blood's new total.
* DMG dealt to [[shield]]s will not be mitigated or contribute to Redmane's Blood.
* It is possible for Dehya to [[Fallen Character|die]] from DMG taken from Redmane's Blood, even if she is off-field.
* Redmane's Blood's DoT will trigger effects that require taking DMG, such as [[Serpent Spine]]'s stack loss.
* Redmane's Blood's DoT can be mitigated by [[shield]]s.
** If Dehya is off-field, only one-character shields (e.g., Noelle's [[Devotion|1st Ascension Passive]], [[The Bell]]'s passive) will be able to mitigate DMG. Party-wide shields (e.g., [[Zhongli]]'s [[Dominus Lapidis|Elemental Skill]]) will ''not'' mitigate DMG for Dehya if she is off-field.
* Redmane's Blood's DoT can be nullified by [[Elemental Burst]] [[i-frames]]. However, [[dash]] i-frames are ineffective.
* If a hit brings Redmane's Blood above its maximum, this hit will still receive full DMG mitigation and Dehya will take all of the mitigated DMG.

;<big>Passive Effects</big>
* {{Talent Note|ascension|1|Unstinting Succor|character=Dehya|talent=Molten Inferno}}
** This Passive Effect directly reduces DMG from each DoT ticks from Redmane's Blood during the duration. It does not reduce the DMG "stored" in Redmane's Blood. 

;<big>Constellation Effects</big>
* {{Talent Note|constellation|1|The Flame Incandescent|Molten Inferno's DMG is increased by 3.6% of Dehya's Max HP.}}
* {{Talent Note|constellation|2|The Sand-Blades Glittering}}
* {{Talent Note|constellation|5|The Alpha Unleashed}}
