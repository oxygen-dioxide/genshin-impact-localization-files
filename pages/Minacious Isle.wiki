'''Minacious Isle''' is a limited time subarea located in the southwest part of [[Golden Apple Archipelago]].

According to [[Albedo]], the main island used to be a mountain from [[Mondstadt]], before it was ripped away and landed in the sea upside-down.<ref>Event [[Echoing Tales]] Conch Retrospection, VI: Familiar Voices - [[Echoing Tales/Story#VI: Familiar Voices|An Archon's Deeds]]</ref> The island features Inverted Ruins as well as [[Dandelion]]s and various Anemo enemies like Anemo slimes and an Eye of the Storm, which coincides with Mondstadt being the nation of Anemo. Moreover, there is a portal leading back to Mondstadt as part of the quest ''[[The Winding Homeward Way]]''.
