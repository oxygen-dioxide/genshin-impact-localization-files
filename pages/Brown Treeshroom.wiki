|description    = Tall mushrooms with special "iron-brown" caps. Their standing forms imitate those of trees, and they also have the traits of shrubbery, which has given them the name "Treeshroom." Rumors amongst some adventurers claim that those who wish to delve deep into the forests can even use the stipes of these mushrooms as emergency weaponry.
