'''''"Heart of Watatsumi"''''' is the final part of the [[The Moon-Bathed Deep]] World Quest Series.

==Steps==
# Return to [[Sangonomiya Shrine]] and talk to [[Tsuyuko]]
# Open the gate to the "Heart of Watatsumi"
# Go to the "Heart"
# Break the final seal
#* From the entrance, walk to the central pedestal for directional orientation. The southwest platform (nearest to entrance), northwest platform, and northeast platform can be completed in any order:
#** Go to the platform
#** Rotate the fish statues until they face each other
#** Defeat the [[Hydro Mimics]] that appear
#*** On southwest platform: {{Enemy List|Hydro Mimic Ferret;Hydro Mimic Finch}}
#*** On northwest platform: {{Enemy List|Hydro Mimic Finch;Hydro Mimic Boar}}
#*** On northeast platform: {{Enemy List|Hydro Mimic Frog;Hydro Mimic Crab}}
#** Activate the [[Mysterious Pillar]]
#*** If the player forgets to activate the Mysterious Pillar, they may realign the fish statues without fighting the Mimics again.
#* Go to the southeast platform and activate the Mysterious Pillar
#* Rotate the fish statues until they face each other
#* Defeat 3 waves of Hydro Mimics that appear
#** Wave 1: {{Enemy List|Hydro Mimic Crane*3;Hydro Mimic Ferret;Hydro Mimic Finch}}
#** Wave 2: {{Enemy List|Hydro Mimic Crane*3;Hydro Mimic Boar;Hydro Mimic Finch}}
#** Wave 3: {{Enemy List|Hydro Mimic Crane*3;Hydro Mimic Frog;Hydro Mimic Crab}}
#* If the player leaves the cave while there are undefeated Hydro Mimics, the Hydro Mimics will despawn. The player must log in again to proceed. Upon logging in again, progress on this step is completely reset; the player must solve all puzzles and fight all Hydro Mimics again.
# Obtain the [[Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep|Key of the Deep]]
# Talk to Tsuyuko

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completion of this quest will grant the ''[[Inazuma: The Islands of Thunder and Eternity - Series II]]'' [[Achievement]] "[[The Same Moonlight]]."
* There is a [[Rock Pile]] located to the west of the middle circle (below an overhang) that when broken reveals a Precious Chest. The chest contains the blueprints for the [[Ritual Shrine]] and [[War Drum: Line-Breaking Reverb]] furnishings.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You have the four [[Spirit Pearl]]s. It's time to report your progress to Tsuyuko.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Tsuyuko at the shrine)
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Welcome back, (Traveler). Is there something I can do for you?
:{{DIcon}} So, about your commission...
:'''Paimon:''' We got the four [[Spirit Pearl]]s!
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Is that so? I knew I could count on you, thank you very much! Then, there is only one step away from unlocking the final seal of the "heart."
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Sorry, I have to ask you both to come along with me &mdash; I hope you don't mind.
:'''Paimon:''' Since we're already here, a little more's no biggie! Right, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine with it.
:'''Tsuyuko:''' There's no time to lose. Let's head off!
{{Dialogue end}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|Use the four Spirit Pearls to open the gate to the "heart."}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Arrive at the seal of the "heart")
:'''Tsuyuko:''' This is the place!
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Take out all the Spirit Pearls you collected before, it's finally time to use them.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|The place where Watatsumi's "heart" is hidden is but one step away...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Interact with the seal of the "heart")
:'''Seal of the "Heart":''' A strange, phosphorescent seal, upon which the symbol of a fish has been graven...
;(Give Spirit Pearl ×4)
;(The seal lights up and disappears)
----
;(Enter the "heart")
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|The seal of the "heart" seems to require both experience and wisdom to break...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, this must be the "heart!"
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Yes, our great [[Omikami]] once stayed here... But now, there's nothing here but the echoing sound of water. It's enough to make one grieve...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh...

;(Approach a platform)
:'''Paimon:''' These fish statues are so familiar... We seem to have encountered them near the "fin"!
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Eh? So you've broken seals like this one before? Well, then I guess there's no need for me to go into too much detail.
:'''Tsuyuko:''' But it looks more complicated this time. We need {{Color|buzzword|all three statues}} to face the center and connect with one another...

;(Align a platform correctly for the first time)
:'''Paimon:''' Yikes! Watch it, something's coming out!

;(Approach the northeast platform before activating the other three)
:'''Paimon:''' This statue isn't responding. Is something stuck?
----
;(A cutscene plays, where water converges to create the [[Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep]])
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|After a long journey, you have finally reached the enigmatic "Heart of Watatsumi"...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Tsuyuko before obtaining the Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep)
:'''Tsuyuko:''' (Miss Tsuyuko seems to be thinking about something, so perhaps this is not the time to disturb her.)

;(Obtain the Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep)
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|Report your findings to Tsuyuko.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon''' Hmm... What is this? Does Tsuyuko recognize it?

;(Talk to Tsuyuko after obtaining the Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep)
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} Miss Tsuyuko...?
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Oh&mdash; Sorry, I was quite lost in thought just then.
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Thanks to your help, we have the Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep in hand.
:'''Paimon:''' The Key of the Moon-shaved what now? ...And what is that, anyway?
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Haha, just call it the "Key of the Deep." We're not going to insist that outlanders use all the proper names for every last thing.
:'''Tsuyuko:''' This is something we will need to open the entrance to [[Enkanomiya]]. It was forged from the very spilled blood of our Omikami...
:'''Tsuyuko:''' ...Or at least, that's what the legends say.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh...
:{{DIcon}} Curiouser and curiouser...
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Haha! It isn't mysterious at all! In fact, it's just the opposite.
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Well, now we just need to report to the [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|Divine Priestess]], await her approval, and then wait for the spirit vein flow to be correct...
:'''Tsuyuko:''' And then, we can head down to Enkanomiya.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, then what did we do all this for?
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Well, it's not as if you gained nothing during this journey, right?
:'''Tsuyuko:''' I mean... You've secured the lasting friendship of the [[Sangonomiya Shrine]]! [[Watatsumi Island]] will welcome you back any time!
:'''Paimon:''' How about something a bit more concrete than that?
:'''Tsuyuko:''' ...
:'''Tsuyuko:''' The records do say that the Spirit Pearls will answer the summons of someone pure, and that the Key will only come together for one whose heart is as clear as the waters themselves.
:'''Tsuyuko:''' I don't generally believe what those texts say, but I do believe that you can turn Watatsumi Island's situation around.
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Well then, when the time comes to go down to Enkanomiya...
:{{DIcon}} We'll meet again then, huh?
:{{DIcon}} You'll draw another fortune slip?
::'''Tsuyuko:''' Hehe, my fortune slip luck is pretty good. I'm certain that we'll meet again.
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Well then, see you.
