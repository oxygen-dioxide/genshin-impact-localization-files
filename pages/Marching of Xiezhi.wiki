==Trivia==
* A {{Lang|{{w|xiezhi}}|zh=獬豸/解廌 |zh_rm=xièzhì}} is a mythical creature found in various East Asian legends. It has the ability to distinguish right from wrong and devours corrupt officials. For this, it is known as a symbol of justice and law and is also called a {{lang|"law beast"|zh=法兽}}. This is a reference to [[Yanfei]]'s half-[[illuminated beast]] status and occupation as a legal advisor.
