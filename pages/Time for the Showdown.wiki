;(Continues from previous quest)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Here it is, the workshop in the sky... You gotta see it to believe it.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Makes you wonder why Tepal even bothers with [[Phlogiston]] Wings when he has tech like this.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Well, according to the notebook, the platform beneath us runs on components from the [[Cinder City]]. Those can't be mass-produced.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Also, I have some doubts about its mobility after seeing how it moved just now...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' For someone like Tepal, who dreams of flying freely, this definitely doesn't cut it.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if he's got that relic, he should be able to make a set of prototype Wings for himself, right?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why bother making a whole flying workshop so he can mass-produce them?
:{{DIcon}} If he can come and go freely from this workshop...
:{{DIcon}} He's probably already built those prototype Wings for himself.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But this doesn't add up... If he's already achieved the power of flight, then he must have bigger dreams we don't know about. But what?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 1 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' With any luck, we'll find the answers in his workshop.

;(Approach the trapped Qucusaur)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 2 coya 01.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! It's a Qucusaurus! Tepal is using them to do bad things after all!<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "*Gasp* Qucusaurs! Seems like the merchants were right. Tepal's using them for his own ends."</ref>
:{{A|vo qsklq005 2 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I'll bet that {{Color|buzzword|mechanism on top}} of the {{Color|buzzword|cage}} opens the door... Let me give it a try.

;(After opening the cage)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 6 flamingo 01.ogg}} '''Trapped Qucusaurus:''' Cheep!

;(Open the next cage)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why won't it fly away like the others? Is it...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 coya 01.ogg}} '''Coya:''' ...Cheep.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...She's still breathing, but barely.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' By the looks of it... Tepal was using these cages to extract phlogiston from the qucusaurs.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Once a qucusaur is drained of phlogiston, it becomes too weak to move... We'll have to come back for these ones after dealing with Tepal.
:{{DIcon}} There's another notebook here.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Let me see... Looks like a record of his phlogiston research.
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 together 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Log No. 330. With the support of {{Obf|2}}, I was finally able to launch the airborne workshop.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 tepal 02.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Even though it relies on the relic for eighty percent of its power supply, I've at least taken the first step.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 tepal 03.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 348. Research on the relic is progressing well. I should be able to replicate the technology and scale up production very soon.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 tepal 04.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' {{Obf|2}} has proposed a name for this groundbreaking invention: the "Phlogiston Wings"... I think I'm getting close. Soon, I will achieve my dreams!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 tepal 05.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 377. Encountered some issues with the new smaller-model Phlogiston Wings. The gaseous phlogiston showed some volatility during the refinement process.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 tepal 06.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' {{Obf|2}} thinks we should proceed at a more cautious pace with the refinement experiments... But after so many past failures, I have to prove that I will succeed this time.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 tepal 07.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 114. Ran an experiment using qucusaurs to refine gaseous phlogiston. It was a success.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 tepal 08.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 117. I have started recruiting merchants and hunters to capture wild qucusaurs.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 tepal 09.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 121. Major breakthrough in the efficiency of phlogiston yield...
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... So many parts have been crossed out!
:{{DIcon}} Based on the context...
:{{DIcon}} It should be someone's name.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yeah, probably the contact he alluded to in his other notebook... Guess he has a benefactor.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, did anyone else notice how the numbering system in this notebook suddenly changed half way through?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, and the tone seemed to change a lot, too...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 7 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We haven't got time for textual analysis, I'm afraid. Grab the notebook and let's press on.

;(Approach the mechanism)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 3 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Huh, never seen one of these before... Looks like this was built with the Cinder City components too...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... You're not thinking of giving it a {{Color|buzzword|nice, hard kick}}, are you...

;(Approach the next mechanism)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Wh&mdash;What's THAT mechanism doing?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 4 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It's asking for a nice, hard kick right where it hurts &mdash; {{Color|buzzword|aim for the weak spot}}!

;(Approach the center of the platform)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are THEY doing here!?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 8 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It's Tepal's henchmen! He must have brought them here using the relic and his prototype Wings... Watch out!

;(Investigate the bookshelf)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look here! More of Tepal's notes!
:{{DIcon}} Let's hope there's some useful information inside.
:{{Black Screen|You scour Tepal's notes for info...}}
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 tepal 01.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 403. {{Obf|2}} introduced me to some new comrades who fully support my ideas.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 tepal 02.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' I told them that some saurians are blessed with wings, and some people with natural gifts, while the less fortunate among us can only look on longingly as they seize the skies...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 tepal 03.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' But I also told them that progress can erase individual differences. Think of the tools humanity has made to fight back against wild beasts, the law we have put in place to even the playing field between the strong and the weak...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 tepal 04.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' I promised them that our research will be the new frontier of human progress. With our Phlogiston Wings, the power of flight will no longer be for a select few to enjoy. Imagine a world where the skies are for all to share!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 tepal 05.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' I only hope that when we finally achieve this goal... {{Obf|2}} will be proud of me.
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' "Imagine a world where the skies are for all to share"... Yes, what a wonderful world that would be...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' If only it were possible. We could respond faster... and so many tragedies could be prevented.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' But Tepal... What about the saurians you're draining dry of phlogiston?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You're not sharing the sky... You're stealing it!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Bad move... I won't let you get away with it.
:{{DIcon}} Chasca...?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 coya 01.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 9 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I'm fine. Let's keep moving &mdash; I don't think we'll find anything else here.

;(Free all four qucusaurs around the platform, optional)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We freed all the qucusaurs we could, right? That's a huge win already! Go us!

;(Approach the main platform [this line does not trigger if all four qucusaurs were freed in the previous step])
:{{A|vo qsklq005 11 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I can't believe he captured so many qucusaurs... But right now, we have focus on solving this problem at the source.

;(Approach the center of the main platform)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Looks like we've reached the center of the workshop...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And still no sign of Coya's baby...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 coya 01.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Let's search this area for now. If we still can't find [[Chime]], we'll double back.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:{{Black Screen|You split up and begin your search...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* Chasca, {{Traveler}}! Come quick!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' What is it? Did you find Chime?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not yet, but look... it's another one of Tepal's notebooks!
:{{DIcon}} Let's give it a read.
:{{DIcon}} Just in case it gives us any clues on Chime's whereabouts.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Alright.
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 01.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 428. We decided to restart the experiments on phlogiston refinement, but without telling {{Obf|2}}.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 02.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' This is the final obstacle to the success of the Phlogiston Wings project. We cannot fall at the last hurdle!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 03.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 436. Earlier today, {{Obf|2}} suggested using qucusaurs as an intermediary to extract refined phlogiston. It's certainly feasible, but...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 04.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Anyway, as long as our secret experiment succeeds, I'm sure {{Obf|2}} won't bring it up again.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 05.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 443. We will conduct the experiment tomorrow. {{Obf|2}} birthday is coming up, so hopefully we'll have a birthday surprise for her.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 06.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' Log No. 444...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 07.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' ...
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why is this log empty?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...I guess whoever wrote down the log number was prevented from recording the results.
:{{DIcon}} There's more. Let's keep reading.
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 08.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' ...Log No. 0.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 09.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' We lost many comrades in the accident... Among them our friends, lovers, and children...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 10.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' But we cannot stop now. We will keep their legacy alive, and carry their dreams forward.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 11.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' As of today, we are scrapping the artificial refinement method. Instead, we will focus all our efforts on phlogiston extraction from live qucusaurs.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 12.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' They are arrogant beasts whose existence in the wild serves no one but themselves. Their true worth lies in their sacrifice for the sake of human progress.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 13.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' To facilitate our operations, we will gradually move the airborne workshop closer to the Flower-Feather Clan, even as we continue to expand it.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 14.ogg}} '''Tepal:''' All this, we do to create a world where the skies are for all of humanity to share.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 tepal 15.ogg}} '''Tepal?:''' All this, we do... to make Tepal's dream a reality.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Given the way this is written, not to mention the fact that the numbering has started over from zero... It kinda sounds like this is someone new. Does that mean that Tepal's already...?
;(Flashback ends)
:{{DIcon}} But in that case, who have we been pursuing?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' There's also a letter tucked into the end of the notebook... It's from [[Puma]].
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 puma 01.ogg}} '''Puma:''' ...Tepal, I don't know where you are right now, so I don't know how to reach you... My best bet is to send this letter to the Flower-Feather Clan.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 puma 02.ogg}} '''Puma:''' Your father is gravely ill. I know we've had our differences in the past, but he is still your father... Won't you come and visit him, please?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 puma 03.ogg}} '''Puma:''' I know you never liked him, and cared even less for me... All you've ever yearned for is the sky... and your birth mother.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 puma 04.ogg}} '''Puma:''' But we'll still be waiting here for you if you do come back. This may be the last chance you'll get to see your father.
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Puma's not Tepal's real mom? Huh... Well, she did say he never called her "Mom," but Paimon assumed she was just venting...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We know that Tepal's father passed away quite recently, and this letter looks recent. By contrast... the writing in this notebook is old and faded.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...It looks like the real reason Tepal didn't attend his father's funeral is because he'd long since passed away himself.
:{{DIcon}} Then... Tepal's birth mother...
:{{DIcon}} Then... the benefactor who funded this workshop...
:{{DIcon}} Then... the real ringleader behind all this...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' If we ask ourselves why this letter was sent to the Flower-Feather Clan, why Tepal always yearned for the sky, and how he got his hands on a relic from the Cinder City...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...It all points to one answer.
:{{Color|menu|It turns out that the real ringleader behind it all was none other than Allpa. She descends upon the airborne workshop on her Phlogiston Wings.}}
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 01.ogg}} '''???:''' That's right. Tepal was my child... he was born during my days as a wingless wanderer.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 02.ogg}} '''???:''' His birth gave me new hope. I wanted to become the kind of mother who spent her days as a valiant rider, soaring the skies... not an aimless, wingless nobody.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 03.ogg}} '''???:''' But his father wanted to settle down, to give his child a safe, sheltered life in his tribe... We fought about it constantly, until the love we once had for each other was gone.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 04.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' He started a new family with another traveler who was also looking to return home... and I went back to the Flower-Feather Clan, alone.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Allpa!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 05.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...I had no idea that despite being raised among the Children of Echoes, my child still harbored dreams of the skies.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 06.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Can you imagine, Chasca? The joy and surprise I felt when he showed up at my door, asking to join the flying trials...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 07.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Or how proud I was when he said he wanted to prove his own worth, rather than relying on my position as elder...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 08.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...And then, the anguish that overcame me when he was rejected by the qucusaurs and became wingless, just as I had after my injury...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...You've got a lot of nerve showing your face here.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 09.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Heh... Don't take this the wrong way, Chasca. I'm not here for a fight. I just want to talk... isn't that your preferred way to resolve things?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 10.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' I trust you've learned of Tepal's wish on your way here: "a world where the skies are for all of humanity to share"
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 11.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' If only his dream can be realized, no one will ever have to lose their wings again. Our aerial prowess will be greater than ever before...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 12.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' War will never again come at such a great cost... The loss of [[Chuychu]] is a tragedy that need never be repeated.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 13.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' So tell me, Chasca... Do you really wish to see the Phlogiston Wings forever grounded and gathering dust?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Nothing you've said excuses all the conflict you've caused.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 14.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' You mean the arguments back at the tribe? It was a necessary measure. Sometimes, this is the only way to accelerate the pace of progress.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 coya 02.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep...!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 15.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Is a mother harming her children when she coaxes them into swallowing a bitter pill? Of course not. It is a brief moment of suffering for the greater good, and the child will come to understand this in due course.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 16.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' The Phlogiston Wings are that bitter pill. We will never progress as a tribe if we cling to the scraps the Qucusaurs offer us.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 17.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Once the people have embraced the Phlogiston Wings, they will never look back &mdash; even if they learn how the refined phlogiston is sourced.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 18.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' They will convince themselves that the sacrifice of a few qucusaurs is a small price to pay for our dominion over the skies.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 19.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' But this I had not anticipated... I barely had the chance to introduce the Phlogiston Wings to the tribe before you found this place...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 13.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Your plan was hardly foolproof.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 20.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Heh... Yet, it can still be salvaged. Chasca, {{Traveler}}, you are the hope of humanity.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 21.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' I'm sure you have your doubts about my methods, but know that my love for humanity and for Natlan is genuine.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 22.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' You know me, Chasca, and you know that I've always treated everyone in the Flower-Feather Clan as my own children.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 23.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' As fellow humans... surely you can understand my perspective?
:{{DIcon}} It's definitely food for thought...
::{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 08a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Quit the quips, this is serious!
:{{DIcon}} You wish.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 14.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Allpa, Natlan doesn't belong to humans alone... and truthfully, neither do I.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 coya 03.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 15.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' How many times has the [[Abyss]] invaded Natlan now? And yet despite how much stronger it is than us, Natlan still stands as a nation of humans and [[saurian]]s.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 16.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' "Peace imposed by force will crumble in a matter of days... Because social bonds are what hold a civilization together." Weren't you the one that taught me that?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 17.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' And yet, you would break the bond we share with our saurian companions to take more power for ourselves? That's as stupid as hacking your own arm off to use it as a club!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 24.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...They are wild beasts, driven purely by instinct. How could they possibly understand human social bonds?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... How did someone like her ever become a rider!?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe qucusaur instincts are not so different from ours...
:{{DIcon}} ...Because clearly, she had them fooled too.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 25.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Hah, you overestimate them. They bow to the strong and shun the weak &mdash; that's all there is to it! They never gave Tepal a second glance when he was at his lowest, nor me when I returned injured from the Cinder City...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 26.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' It's all about survival of the fittest for them, plain and simple. They obeyed me once I proved myself stronger than them, but the moment it serves them better, they'll abandon me in a heartbeat!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 18.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You're wrong, Allpa... They only reject the Wingless because they don't want to fly anyone to their death.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 27.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Hmph... Chasca, I will promise you this: Only the unruliest wild qucusaurs will be used for phlogiston extraction &mdash; the ones who have nothing else to offer to humanity...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 coya 04.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep...!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 19.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Well that's too bad, 'cause I know a few "unruly wild qucusaurs" who don't think that idea's gonna fly. Namely my mom, my sister... and me.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 20.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' And the others? To us, they're friends, family, even children... So if you want to put any of them in one of your cages, you're gonna have to go through us!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 28.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Is that right? I knew you might be difficult to convince &mdash; maybe this will change your mind.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chime 01.ogg}} '''Chime:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 coya 05.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chime!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 21.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Allpa!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 29.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Careful, don't make any rash decisions... Unless you want to see her suffer.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chime 02.ogg}} '''Chime:''' Cheep!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... That's one of the extraction cages!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 30.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' I told my subordinates to take control of the tribe while I was away. Luckily for them... our strongest warrior and our most powerful ally aren't there to stop it.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 22.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Take control...? What are you planning to do with [[Mutota]] and his supporters!?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 31.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Merely accelerate their inevitable downfall &mdash; they cannot stand in the way of progress forever... It is not the move I wished to make, but I'm afraid you and your friends forced my hand.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 32.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' And since you insist on opposing me too, I have no choice but to keep you here until the dust has settled.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 23.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hah, so that's what you meant by, "I just want to talk." You never intended to negotiate, you just wanted to stall us.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 33.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' No, Chasca, I genuinely hoped I could win you over.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 34.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' You are the strongest warriors we have. Put down your weapons, and I promise you that no harm will come to this young saurian.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 35.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' I just need you to stay here for the next couple of weeks or so, while my people consolidate their power. Then, I will give her back to you, and you'll be free to leave.
:{{DIcon}} You really think the [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]] is gonna let you get away with a coup?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 36.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...As long as the majority supports our vision, even the Pyro Archon cannot meddle in our internal affairs.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 24.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Your vision is deranged... and the Flower-Feather Clan will never support it!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 37.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' You sure about that? Then wait here and see. Time will tell.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do we do? Even if the whole tribe fights back, Mutota's in grave danger...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 38.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Stop delaying the inevitable. Drop your weapons and get into the cages. Now.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... She's still holding Chime hostage... Is there really no other way?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 25.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...
:'''Coya:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 coya 07.ogg}} '''Coya:''' (I'm sorry, Chime...)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 coya 08.ogg}} '''Coya:''' (I might have to do something... unmotherly.)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chime 03.ogg}} '''Chime:''' (...Do it, Mom.)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chime 04.ogg}} '''Chime:''' (I don't want to be a burden... What kind of warrior would that make me?)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 chasca 26.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Coya...?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 39.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Huh? What are you yapping about?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 40.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...Stand down. Drop your weapons, now! This instant!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 41.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Ugh... Aah!
:{{Color|menu|Coya charges at Allpa, knocking her down, and the "relic" rolls over to the other side.}}
:{{A|vo qsklq005 12 allpa 42.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' No! The relic...!
:{{DIcon}} ...Now!

;(When Allpa reaches 50% HP)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 13 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Give up, Allpa. We're negotiating my way now, and this ain't your strong suit.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 13 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Shut up, just shut up...! Gah, help! Anybody!?

;(When Allpa reaches 10% HP)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Uh... something's up with this relic!

;(After the fight)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 14 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...Ugh!
:;(The relic shoots fireballs across the workshop, setting it on fire)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No... What is she doing!? She'll bring us all down with her!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 14 allpa 02.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...But why? We stabilized the relic...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 14 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Maybe it got damaged in the fight? If we don't think of something fast, this whole workshop is gonna fall apart!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 14 allpa 03.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' No... They're directly beneath us... My beloved tribe...
:{{DIcon}} Leave the workshop to me.
::{{DIcon}} If we don't solve this problem at the source...
::{{DIcon}} This whole place will come crashing down!
:{{DIcon}} You deal with the relic.

:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 01.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' ....Yes, for the ten-thousandth time, I'm sure. The blast barely touched her. The reason she fainted was old injuries playing up, compounded by over-exertion in recent days...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 02.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' The moment she finally relaxed, all the built-up stress finally caught up with her &mdash; and no wonder... Honestly, she's just like you...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 03.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' Anyway. Now you know how we feel when you go off risking life and limb! Your mother and I would both appreciate it if you lived less dangerously...

:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...You're awake! I'll... I'll go let everyone know...

:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 07.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' *sigh*... What are we gonna do with her, hmm? Even after everything that's happened, she still hasn't figured out how to start the conversation with you...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 08.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' She keeps saying, "I don't think Coya has forgiven me yet"... But if you ask me, she's the one who's scared to open up and have an honest conversation!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 09.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' For all her confidence, she's a very sensitive soul underneath... You'd think as a peacemaker, she of all people would know how to reconcile with her family after a falling out...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 10.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' ...She must have been a handful growing up. Thank you for being there for her.

:{{DIcon}} What were you talking about just now?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 12.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' ...Hmph! I was just telling her that she's not to go chasing danger with Chasca ever again!
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Cusco, I understand how you must feel... But it's all thanks to Coya and Chasca's efforts that the airborne workshop didn't come crashing down on our heads.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon almost forgot to ask... They didn't hurt you while we were gone, did they?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 mutota 02.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Thankfully, when her co-conspirators tried to arrest me, I was out coaching [[Coyllur]] and [[Zhunan]].
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 mutota 03.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' The two of them were a huge help. They took care of things while I went around rallying the resistance... So in the end, Allpa's would-be revolt didn't really get off the ground.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 mutota 04.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' And as it turns out... not all of the Wingless want to see our dear saurian friends replaced with Phlogiston-powered gizmos.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 mutota 05.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' I'm so sorry you got mixed up in this, by the way. We should have caught on to Allpa's scheme sooner... We could have saved so many qucusaurs from getting hurt...
:'''Coya:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 mutota 06.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Most of the airborne workshop has now been dismantled. We've just left one small, harmless part intact... and repurposed it as a jail for Allpa and her cronies.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see how THEY like being locked up in a sky prison!
:{{DIcon}} How the tables have turned.
:{{DIcon}} Time they got a taste of their own medicine.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 cusco 13.ogg}} '''Cusco:''' ...So, it looks like there's just one last conflict left to resolve. Peacemaker, you're up.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...*sigh*
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I said it had to wait until things had blown over, didn't I... And now they have... But I still have no idea what to say.
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Coya, I just want to say... I'm sorry for how things went down back then.

:{{DIcon}} Paimon... Zip it.

:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 coya 07.ogg}} '''Coya:''' (Alright... I admit, I was angry in that moment. I thought you were their accomplice...)
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Huh... So then... when did you finally make your peace with it?
:{{A|vo qsklq005 16 chime 01.ogg}} '''Chime:''' (Moooooom!)
