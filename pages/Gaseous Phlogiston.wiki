'''Gaseous Phlogiston''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. 

It is a form of [[Phlogiston]] that can occur freely (e.g., leaking out of the ground) or form Phlogiston Currents, Phlogiston Wind Tunnels, or Scorchwind Confluxes. Being in contact with gaseous Phlogiston will damage the active character for '''2.5%''' of their max [[HP]] every 0.5 seconds, however [[Qucusaurus|Qucusaurs]], members of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]], and [[Mavuika]] will not take damage.

For Qucusaurs and members of the Flower-Feather Clan, interacting with a Phlogiston Current, Phlogiston Wind Tunnel, or Scorchwind Conflux will refill their Phlogiston meter. This is mostly the same with Mavuika, except for being unable to use Phlogiston Wind Tunnels.<!-- Phlogiston Wind Tunnel + Scorchwind Conflux fully refills Phlogiston instantly, Phlogiston Current continuously refills a small % -->

The effect conferred by a Scorchwind Conflux lasts for about 8 seconds. The Scorchwind Conflux will respawn shortly after.

==Description==
{{Description|'''Gaseous Phlogiston Environment'''<ul><li>A form of Phlogiston that resembles a gas.</li><li>In essence, it is still Phlogiston, and it contains massive amounts of heat, making it very dangerous. While in Wind Currents formed by gaseous Phlogiston or areas with large amounts of gaseous Phlogiston, you will be burned by the high temperatures.</li><li>However, Qucusaurs and some members of the Flower-Feather Clan have mastered the art of using gaseous Phlogiston without getting burned.</li></ul>}}
