{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If Hautemontagne is in Qiaoying Village, before completing ''[[Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble]]'')
:'''Hautemontagne:''' Oh, I'm enjoying this life, let me tell you...
:{{DIcon}} This is an order from the [[Fontaine Research Institute|Fontaine Research Institute]], Hautemontagne!
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Bah! *coughs* What are you doing? Why did you scare me like that?
::'''Hautemontagne:''' I just wasted a good cup of tea... You had me thinking that they needed people so badly that they've come to kidnap me!
::{{DIcon}} Feeling guilty, aren't you?
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Guilty? Nonsense. I'm here on official business! Look, they sent someone to the Institute because they needed someone to repair something. The Institute couldn't find anyone, and when they noticed I was twiddling my thumbs in [[Lumidouce Harbor]], they ultimately decided to send me...
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Right, I know what you're going to ask next. I was working on applying the Multi-Phase Tuner to hydrology, so I'm more on the application side.
::'''Hautemontagne:''' My head hurts just looking at the theoretical discussions. We don't get a lot of opportunities to be in the spotlight, but I'm satisfied just looking at my results being implemented and in operation.
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Oops, I accidentally said things that I shouldn't have. Please don't take what I said seriously.
:{{DIcon}} When are you planning on returning to the Institute?
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Returning? Well... When the repairs are done, of course. The Three-Phase Asynchronous Elemental Tuner is not something that can be fixed in a day.
::'''Hautemontagne:''' I also have to design a comprehensive maintenance plan for the folks here. It requires taking the environment, the people, changes in the geography, and available materials into consideration.
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Everything needs time, so I won't be back anytime soon. What a shame... I do sometimes miss the free chips and [[Fonta]] at the Institute, you know...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Sorry about not seeing you off, but I've got a show to be at later.

;(If Hautemontagne is in Qiaoying Village, after completing ''[[Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble]]'')
:'''Hautemontagne:''' I'm really enjoying this life...
:{{DIcon}} This is an order from [[Choiseul]], Hautemontagne!
::'''Hautemontagne:''' *cough* *coughing fit*
::'''Hautemontagne:''' What are you doing, using his name? Don't scare me like that! I'm on the application side, so only [[Raimondo]] can fire me!
::'''Hautemontagne:''' You got me good there. For a moment, I thought they needed people so badly that they'd sent someone to come kidnap me!
::{{DIcon}} Feeling guilty, aren't you?
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Guilty? Nonsense. I'm here on official business! Look, Qiaoying Village sent someone to the Institute because they needed someone to repair something.

::'''Hautemontagne:''' Oops, I accidentally said things that I shouldn't have. Please don't take what I said seriously, Honorary Senior Researcher. I'm begging you! Please don't rat me on me to Choiseul or Raimondo.
:{{DIcon}} When are you planning on returning to the Institute?
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Returning? Well... When the repairs are done, of course. The Three-Phase Asynchronous Elemental Tuner is not something that can be fixed in a day.
::'''Hautemontagne:''' I also have to design a comprehensive maintenance plan for the folks here. It requires taking the environment, the people, changes in the geography, and available materials into consideration.
::'''Hautemontagne:''' See, all this takes time, so I won't be able to go back for quite a while.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hautemontagne:''' Wait! Wait! I'm begging you, Honorary Senior Researcher. Please don't rat me out back at the institute! Please!

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If Hautemontagne and Little Mao are in Yilong Wharf)
:'''Little Mao:''' Listening to Mountain, it sounds like Fontaine's operas are pretty similar to ours!
:'''Little Mao:''' Knights, magicians, brave warriors, and evil dragons, you kill me, I kill you, and in the end, everyone winds up dead!
:'''Hautemontagne:''' What's important isn't the ending! It's the process &mdash; how you get there! Not every tragedy can be seen as a mere sequence of fight scenes!
:'''Little Mao:''' Oh, oh! And the "[[Praetorian Golem|Ray-more-young Golems]]" Mountain was just talking about sound really, really cool too! I wonder if they're bigger than [[Lingyuan|Bluey]]?
:'''Hautemontagne:''' Eh? Bluey?
:'''Little Mao:''' Oh, right! I never told you about Bluey, did I... How about this? You tell me more about "Ray-more-young Golems," and I'll tell you about Bluey!
