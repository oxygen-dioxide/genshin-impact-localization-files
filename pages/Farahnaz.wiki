:'''Farahnaz:''' ...It's a shame that the Alliance was destroyed...
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge

:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Farahnaz:''' Haha, putting different cards into a single deck, it feels like an "alliance"...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Farahnaz:''' It's a mixed feeling to see the characters in the deck get knocked down...
:{{DIcon}} The Alliance?
::'''Farahnaz:''' Hey, did you not hear the story I just told you?
::'''Farahnaz:''' That's okay, I'll tell you again!
::'''Farahnaz:''' Back then, when Port Ormos wasn't as peaceful, the Alliance of the Twenty-Nine Ocean Deys was established.
::'''Farahnaz:''' The major pirate leaders who joined took stock of the situation and established a fair division of power in the Alliance.
::'''Farahnaz:''' Each Alliance leader, or "Dey," vowed to live together in peace and prosperity.
::'''Farahnaz:''' But they did not expect that...
::{{DIcon}} A traitor?
::'''Farahnaz:''' Yes, that was part of it. They are profit-oriented pirates after all, so a friendly co-existence is not their style.
::'''Farahnaz:''' But I think where there's conflict, there must be a winner. It's not like there isn't even one Dey left, right?
::'''Farahnaz:''' But everyone is equal in the face of a sea monster invasion.
::'''Farahnaz:''' According to folk legend, a huge sea beast never seen before stirred up a giant wave that wiped out the Alliance overnight...
::'''Farahnaz:''' Oh, what a great story. It's a pity that it's only written about in scientific papers.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Farahnaz:''' After the roar of the sea subsided, everything was in ruins...
