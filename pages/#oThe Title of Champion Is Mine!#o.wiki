|description    = A kite the [[Traveler]] made under the guidance of [[Cloud Retainer]]. It captures [[Paimon]]'s triumphant expression, as though she were declaring victory in the kite contest: "Mwahahahaha! The title of champion kite-flyer is mine!"<br>There can be no doubt that a kite decorated with such a fine image is a strong contender for champion. But to avoid any misunderstandings, do try not to fly it within any Fontainian cities during the first three days of the month...
