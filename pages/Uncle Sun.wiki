'''Uncle Sun''' {{Lang|zh=老孙|zh_rm=Lǎosūn}} is an [[NPC]] in [[Liyue Harbor]] He can be found at the dockside fish market near the southeastern part of Liyue Harbor during the day (06:00 – 19:00). While his shop is open, he sells fish and other seafood, most notably [[Crab]]s. His stock refreshes daily.

At night (19:00 – 06:00), he closes his shop and moves from the harbor to [[Third-Round Knockout]], where he can be found sitting next to [[Uncle Gao]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Uncle Sun's fish are a better deal than the neighboring Uncle Gao's &mdash; or, at least, that's what the two want you to think. In reality, while found drinking together at Third-Round Knockout at night, they reveal they are in cahoots. By deliberately setting a higher price for his fish, Gao convinces people to buy from Sun, thinking his fish is a better deal. The two then split the profits.

He also converses with Uncle Gao during the [[Archon Quest]] "[[The Fond Farewell]]". They discuss [[Osial]]'s resurrection and attack on Liyue Harbor, and speculate that [[Tartaglia|the one behind it]] was also involved in [[Rex Lapis]]' assassination. They then listen as the [[Millelith]] give the [[Liyue Qixing]]'s official story behind the matter.

===Personality===
Uncle Sun is persistent in calling his fish "super fresh," making a point to claim that it is "worlds apart" from regular ol' fresh fish. He also bemoans how low he is selling his fish for, saying he's only barely breaking even and that he can't go much lower. This is all a ruse, however, to convince shoppers that he's giving them a better deal &mdash; in fact, they are likely selling fish for much more than it's actually worth, using Uncle Gao's deliberately-higher prices to convince people that Uncle Sun's prices are fairer.

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Uncle Sun:''' Ah, another patron! Would you like to purchase some fish?
:'''Uncle Sun:''' I promise that all my fish are fre&mdash;... No, super fresh!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Buy some super fresh fish.
::'''Uncle Sun:''' Choose whichever you like, they're all super fresh.
:;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean by "super fresh?"
::'''Uncle Sun:''' The only fish that I sell here are "super fresh" fish.
::'''Uncle Sun:''' It might not sound like there's much difference between fresh and super fresh, but they couldn't be more different. In terms of size, or quality, you name it. They're worlds apart!
::'''Uncle Sun:''' And I can guarantee one thing for sure: my prices are better than the opposite stand over there.
::{{DIcon}} The opposite stand...
::'''Uncle Sun:''' *sigh* You see, not long ago we were both charging higher prices, but my fish were selling better because they were more fresh.
::'''Uncle Sun:''' Then, Uncle Gao started lowering his prices, probably just jealous of all the business I was getting. Before I knew it, I was stuck in a price war with him.
::'''Uncle Sun:''' So in order to provide fresh fish to everyone at a reasonable price, I decided to lower my prices to just breaking even...
::'''Uncle Sun:''' *sigh* I don't know how long I can keep my prices so low. I can only count on the support of all my local customers at this point.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, goodbye.
::'''Uncle Sun:''' Take care, now. And thanks for your loyal support, haha.
