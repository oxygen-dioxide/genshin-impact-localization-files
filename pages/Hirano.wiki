{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hirano:''' Hello. Do you need help with anything?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Hirano:''' This is the mansion of the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission. It is also the place where the Commissioner works. Outsiders aren't usually allowed here.
::'''Hirano:''' But I remember that you are a guest of [[Kamisato Ayaka|Miss Kamisato]]... In which case, please be my guest.
::{{DIcon}} You're pretty relaxed, eh...
:::'''Hirano:''' Ah, well.. Ahem, you are right. As the guard of the Kamisato Mansion, I shouldn't really let my guard down.
:::'''Hirano:''' I have a friend who is also a guard at the [[Tenryou Commission]]. He told me that he was very worried about those people affected by the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] seeking revenge.
:::'''Hirano:''' Now that I think of it, the peaceful Kamisato Clan is far safer than the other two Commissions, who've made a lot of enemies.
:::'''Hirano:''' This might also be because Mr. [[Thoma]] is too reliable. I have always felt safe here. Hahaha...
:::{{DIcon}} About Thoma...
::::'''Hirano:''' When Mr. Thoma first came to the Kamisato Clan, people suspected him on account of his being an outlander.
::::'''Hirano:''' But from my observations, Mr. Thoma is steady and friendly ⁠&mdash; and he is a truly reliable fellow.
::::'''Hirano:''' I mean, why else would he be the trusted assistant of [[Kamisato Ayato|the Commissioner]] and Miss Kamisato, right? Haha!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hirano:''' Glory to [[Ei|the Shogun]] and her everlasting reign!

;(Talk to [[Hirano]] or [[Hirotatsu]])
:'''Hirotatsu:''' So many congratulatory letters and gifts from everywhere... Gotta make sure to keep a record of them all.
:'''Hirano:''' [[Dandelion Wine]] from [[Mondstadt]], [[Cor Lapis]] from [[Liyue Harbor]]... Hmm? These... are marked for delivery to the [[Yashiro Commission]] and [[Amenoma Smithy]].
:'''Hirotatsu:''' Huh. They look like forging blueprints, and none I've ever seen before... But they are of Inazuman style. Could they be schematics that were lost at some point in the past?
:'''Hirano:''' I'd guess [[Akademiya]] historians recreated and collated them. Couldn't have been easy, I'll say that. [[Wanderer|The sender]] has signed off as... the [[Vahumana]] school?
