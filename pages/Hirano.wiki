==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hirano:''' Hello. Do you need help with anything?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Hirano:''' This is the mansion of the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission. It is also the place where the Commissioner works. Outsiders aren't usually allowed here.
::'''Hirano:''' But I remember that you are a guest of [[Kamisato Ayaka|Miss Kamisato]]... In which case, please be my guest.
::{{DIcon}} You're pretty relaxed, eh...
:::'''Hirano:''' Ah, well.. Ahem, you are right. As the guard of the Kamisato Mansion, I shouldn't really let my guard down.
:::'''Hirano:''' I have a friend who is also a guard at the [[Tenryou Commission]]. He told me that he was very worried about those people affected by the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] seeking revenge.
:::'''Hirano:''' Now that I think of it, the peaceful Kamisato Clan is far safer than the other two Commissions, who've made a lot of enemies.
:::'''Hirano:''' This might also be because Mr. [[Thoma]] is too reliable. I have always felt safe here. Hahaha...
:::{{DIcon}} About Thoma...
:::'''Hirano:''' When Mr. Thoma first came to the Kamisato Clan, people suspected him on account of {{Not a typo|his}} being an outlander.
:::'''Hirano:''' But from my observations, Mr. Thoma is steady and friendly ⁠&mdash; and he is a truly reliable fellow.
:::'''Hirano:''' I mean, why else would he be the trusted assistant of [[Kamisato Ayato|the Commissioner]] and Miss Kamisato, right? Haha!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hirano:''' Glory to [[Ei|the Shogun]] and her everlasting reign!
