==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The word ''girdle'' refers to a belt or cord worn around the waist, but can also refer to a thing that surrounds something like a belt or girdle. 
** This may be in reference to the {{w|Shahnameh}}, in which {{w|Haoma|''Hōm}} captures {{w|Afrasiyab}} in a snare, also translated as girdle, and takes him away from the cavern in which he dwelt, which is directly referenced in the name of the [[Point of Interest]] [[Hangeh Afrasiyab]], located within Girdle of the Sands.
