:'''Muuziyaa:''' ...Huh? The tall one lost? How does that work?
:'''Muuziyaa:''' He had the edge in both size and strength. Then all of a sudden, swoosh, and he's lost. It's impossible... The fight was rigged!
:'''Cuaxilo:''' Uhh, so I'm guessing you don't watch a lot of wrestling? With a match like that, y'see, it's obvious at a glance who's winning.
:'''Cuaxilo:''' That big lunk looked like he was pressing the advantage, forcing his way forward, but in reality, his opponent was controlling his movements and slowly backing him into a corner...
:'''Cuaxilo:''' He'd have been badly injured if there were no mats to break his fall. That really isn't how you're supposed to wrestle.
:'''Muuziyaa:''' Oh, so it's because the arena is too small and slippery? Very fitting for the [[Collective of Plenty]]. There's clearly great value in learning how to make use of your surroundings.
:'''Muuziyaa:''' Looks like I made the right decision to come here on a rare day off from the flying squad to watch wrestling. Okay! Could you teach me how to do it, please?
:'''Cuaxilo:''' Huh? Me!? But I... I'm more of a commentator... I...
:'''Muuziyaa:''' Don't be so modest! I look forward to hearing all your tips!
