{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Acomitl, Manyoya, and Matahga)
:'''Acomitl:''' Why must I persist? Why can't I just give up...? Forget it, I give up! Help me, Manyoya.
:'''Matahga:''' What an embarrassment! Stop acting like a child and giving up whenever things don't go smoothly. How can you even call yourself a warrior? I'm ashamed to call you my brother.
:'''Acomitl:''' And are you telling me you've never been stumped and needed help?
:'''Matahga:''' I have, which is why I'm here to get Father and Manyoya's opinions on the fruits of my special training. I'm not a coward like you!
:'''Manyoya:''' Acomitl, I believe the captain rejected your resignation so that you could give it more thought. Don't make important decisions in the heat of things.
:'''Manyoya:''' Calm down and make your own choice. The most important thing is that you don't come to regret it.
:'''Manyoya:''' I'm retired, and even I don't know what the future holds for me, so I fear I haven't the right to give you any guidance.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! So you three are siblings!
:{{DIcon}} Didn't see that coming...
:{{DIcon}} It was quite obvious.
:'''All Three Together:''' It's you two!?
:'''Acomitl:''' My apologies, dear benefactor. My escape plan fell through.
:{{DIcon}} As expected.
:{{DIcon}} (Shrug)
:'''Acomitl:''' Is there no way for me to escape this pain? Being a warrior is so exhausting. Why can't everything be simpler?
:'''???:''' Still preoccupied with thoughts of the flying squad?
:'''???:''' I'm sorry, Acomitl. Based on my experience, things don't get simpler that way.
:'''???:''' Still, I just finished repairing Matahga's arm guards. Manyoya, do yours's need any work? Hmm? We have guests.
:'''Manyoya:''' Ah, they're adventurers we met during our training away from home, father. They even helped Acomitl out.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Then greetings, kind friends. I'm Xueyoni, a training master and their father.
:'''Paimon:''' Acomitl seems to be in terrible condition, so let us know if you need help.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Thank you for the offer, but I think Acomitl is completely fine.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? You intend to just leave him be?
:'''Xueyoni:''' Haha! What I'm trying to say is... Let's put it this way. You're adventurers, so you must have joined the [[Adventurers' Guild]], right?
:'''Xueyoni:''' Now that's an amazing organization. You adventurers desire to explore the world, right?
:'''Xueyoni:''' Even so, I imagine every adventurer has their motivations. Some explore for the money, others desire knowledge, and some are just bored of doing nothing.
:'''Xueyoni:''' So, it's a most impressive feat the Adventurers' Guild has achieved in uniting all those people under one banner.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Take me for example. I'm an old man who retired after serving as a [[Saurian]] rider in the flying squad and went on to become a master trainer in our tribe. Yet, I cannot imagine what a Guild containing the master trainers of all six tribes would look like.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... What does that have to do with Acomitl?
:'''Manyoya:''' That's how our father explains things. Back when he was still in the flying squad, everyone there, even the [[Qucusaur]]s, would willingly hear his opinion.
:'''Manyoya:''' He's now a master trainer for our tribe, and anyone who wishes to become a warrior comes to seek his advice, so relax &mdash; just listen for now.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Heh, that's all in the past, Manyoya. But I shall finish the tale all the same.
:'''Xueyoni:''' We master trainers aspire toward the ideal of the "warrior." That's what inspires us to take the time and effort to design and set our training programs up.
:'''Xueyoni:''' We all have a "dream warrior" we wish to see emerge, but no single person can dictate what such a warrior should be.
:'''Xueyoni:''' We master trainers have found agreeing on any principles and regulations impossible, let alone forming a Guild.
:'''Xueyoni:''' That "greatest warrior" has countless faces and personalities.
:'''Xueyoni:''' They are strong-willed at times, but they sometimes struggle with self-doubt &mdash; not to mention how they will age and die.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Must warriors be immune to burnout? I can show you multiple woven scrolls that show how self-doubt and exhaustion plague everyone equally.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Must warriors be huge? I know of many who looked like giants yet were despicable beyond compare. Such are recorded upon woven scrolls too.
:'''Xueyoni:''' And of course, warriors will decline, as the law of nature dictates.
:'''Xueyoni:''' My kids call me a warrior, but look at me. I'm an old bird who doesn't fly anymore &mdash; I've no strength for it.
:'''Xueyoni:''' A warrior with a perfect face, a person who conforms to every boring standard, will not be recognized as a hero here in Natlan.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Manyoya, Acomitl, Matahga, I've brought you here, for you are to be the heroes of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]], gazing down from a great height.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Your worries and desires are fleeting states on a hero's long journey, not problems that need solving.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Does leaving the flying squad mean one is no longer a warrior? Does joining the flying squad automatically make one a warrior? There are no such things.
:'''Xueyoni:''' It's okay to have ambitions, to hesitate, and to feel lost. You are a warrior, and a warrior must undergo trials to become a hero.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Accept how you are now, learn to live with that state, and overcome it. Never let it control you.
:'''Xueyoni:''' This is the way of Natlan &mdash; the way of heroes. Do you understand?
:'''Manyoya:''' I understand, Father.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Acomitl, are you still hesitating?
:'''Acomitl:''' ...
:'''Xueyoni:''' Constant lectures aren't our family's way. Go fly with your brother and sister, just like when you were little.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Let your mind and body help you decide. Staying cooped up in the house and overthinking things won't lead to any good.
:'''Acomitl:''' I got it, Father.
:'''Paimon:''' Do Master Trainers always speak so abstractly? Paimon didn't really get any of it. Did you, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Yep. Basically, this will involve a Gliding Challenge.
:{{DIcon}} Nope. Family upbringing techniques are too profound.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Adventurer, I've heard about you from my kids. You're a fascinating young person.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Having the guts to compete with Manyoya, help little Acomitl... and you even gained Matahga's recognition &mdash; a true warrior, you are.
:'''Xueyoni:''' I'd like to invite you to fly with these kids. How about it?
:{{DIcon}} Bring it on.
:{{DIcon}} Let me think about it.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Haha, alright. When you've decided, come over and let us know.
:'''Xueyoni:''' All three of my kids are top-tier fliers in the Flower-Feather Clan. You'll have a great time flying together.

;(Talk to Acomitl, Manyoya, or Matahga, optional)
:'''Matahga:''' Another race? Haha! Just wait and see!
:'''Manyoya:''' You're pretty confident. C'mon, Acomitl. We can't lose here!
:'''Acomitl:''' Losing to you is whatever, but there's no way I'm losing to Matahga!
:'''Acomitl:''' {{Traveler}}, be sure to give it your all, too. Don't fall for Matahga's late-game pushes. He's been doing that for ages.
:'''Acomitl:''' When you're ready, let my father know, and we'll fly together.

;(Talk to Xueyoni)
:'''Xueyoni:''' Come and fly with my kids, young one. It's not every day you get to compete with the Flower-Feather Clan's finest.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Chase after the {{Color|buzzword|flying torch}} on the course. Whoever catches it first wins. That's how I trained them when they were little.
:'''Xueyoni:''' {{Color|buzzword|The torch is held by a balloon decorated with red feathers}}, symbolizing the responsibility and honor that a warrior should bear. I made it for them.
:'''Xueyoni:''' You'll recognize it once you see it. So, are you up for the contest?
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready.
::'''Xueyoni:''' Haha, great! Let's head to the starting point and get ready then.
:{{DIcon}} I need a little more time.
::'''Xueyoni:''' Let us know when you're ready then.

;(During the first part of the race)
:'''Matahga:''' Well, so you do know how to fly, Acomitl &mdash; and well, at that! Why do you keep saying you can't, then?
:'''Acomitl:''' Hmph. What do you know?
<!--- Check for additional dialogue. --->

;(After completing the first part of race)
:'''Matahga:''' Haha! Sorry, but I pulled ahead this time!
:'''Acomitl:''' Gah, Matahga, you annoying little... You've been like this since forever, always going all out in the second half!
:'''Matahga:''' Feeling bitter? Catch me if you can, then! Haha!

;(During the second part of the race)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, is stuff like that supposed to happen!? Is this what they call "strategy" for competitive sports!?
:'''Acomitl:''' Matahga's brain has nothing but flying and flying competitions for stuffing. Everything else, and he's dumb as a rock and twice as slow on the uptake.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. That's brothers for you...

;({{Cx}}) <!-- May trigger after a specific point on the track, or approaching quickly from last place? -->
:'''Manyoya:''' You're fast! Faster even than the three of us, perhaps! Good, very good!
:'''Manyoya:''' Amazing, you're so fast!

;(When taking third place during the race)
::'''Acomitl:''' Got ahead of me real quick, didn't you? I knew you were good.

;(When taking second place during the race)
::'''Matahga:''' Wow, you caught up again. Impressive.

;(When taking first place during the race)
::'''Manyoya:''' With this kinda speed, it'd be a shame if you become a Saurian tamer.

;(If the race was failed) <!-- Ways to fail the race: Lag too far behind? -->
:'''Xueyoni:''' Not bad, young one! Hahahaha!
:'''Xueyoni:''' But you'll need more practice if you want to surpass my kids. Don't take it too hard, though! It's rare for anyone to achieve success in one go.
:'''Xueyoni:''' If you want to try again, just come find me.

;(After completing the race)
:'''Xueyoni:''' You flew well, young one!
:'''Acomitl:''' How was my flying just now?
:{{DIcon}} Excellent.
:{{DIcon}} Not bad.
:'''Acomitl:''' Thanks for your encouragement, but I can tell you're still a cut above.
:'''Matahga:''' Acomitl...
:'''Acomitl:''' It's not what you think. I'm not discouraged because I can't outdo others. I can fly, I know I can.
:'''Acomitl:''' Still, being in bad form for so long has ruined my self-confidence. I just can't approach flying with any sense of calm.
:'''Acomitl:''' {{Traveler}}'s different. {{MC|m=His|f=Her}} posture is way more relaxed. Anyone with eyes can see that.
:'''Acomitl:''' Father, I know that you and sis want me to make up my own mind and not avoid the issue.
:'''Acomitl:''' But if I told you now, that whether it's my body, my brain, or my heart...
:'''Acomitl:''' That they all refuse to continue on a path that's not meant for me... Would you still support me?
:'''Manyoya:''' It's okay, so long as it's your own decision, and you're willing to shoulder the consequences.
:'''Acomitl:''' Matahga, will you...
:'''Matahga:''' Hey! I'm not going to criticize you at a time like this. I've always known the sort of person you are, Big Brother.
:'''Matahga:''' If you can't handle this, then just make a decisive break with it. As long as you stay true to yourself, you remain a warrior. No one has the right to criticize you.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Sometimes, the job of a Master Trainer is quite easy. I make training plans for warriors, but I don't have to take part myself.
:'''Xueyoni:''' However, I, too, once flew around with Saurians day in and day out, and I know the true face of that kind of life.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Criticizing others is easy. Taking action is always harder.
:'''Xueyoni:''' As a trainer, I suggest you request time off to recuperate both physically and mentally, even if it leads to dissatisfaction within the team.
:'''Xueyoni:''' As your father, I know you don't want to continue, and I respect that choice.
:'''Xueyoni:''' No longer being part of the flying squad isn't the end of the world. The warriors of the Flower-Feather Clan don't have to prove their worth through flying alone.
:'''Acomitl:''' Thank you... I was worried you'd...
:'''Manyoya:''' Don't overthink it. We're your family, and we'll always help you find a way, no matter what.
:'''Paimon:''' Being a warrior sure is tough! Paimon never imagined it would be this hard to join the Flower-Feather Clan's flying squad.
:{{DIcon}} We have our own hardships.
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, that's right! Thinking about all the things we've encountered along the way, we've overcome them all. That's something we can be proud of, eh?
:{{DIcon}} Not everyone can be a warrior.
::'''Paimon:''' That's kinda strict, but it does make sense. Oh well, not like Paimon wanted to become one anyway, what with all that training every day.
:'''Xueyoni:''' And if becoming a warrior isn't easy in itself, growing from a warrior into a hero is even more so.
:'''Xueyoni:''' I've seen enough of the former to know when someone possesses the qualities needed to become the latter.
:'''Xueyoni:''' You have undergone many trials, haven't you, youngster? I can see it in your eyes.
:{{DIcon}} Like you wouldn't believe.
:{{DIcon}} (Remain silent)
:'''Xueyoni:''' It seems I wasn't mistaken. Your path differs from ours, and you might still have a ways to go. I'd be happy to assist a future hero.
:'''Xueyoni:''' What's more, you've met and helped our family.
:'''Xueyoni:''' If you want to use the training course here, just let me know. You can take off from here anytime.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:'''Xueyoni:''' Don't mention it. If anything, I'm eager to witness the moment you become a hero, resplendent in the skies.
;(Quest completes)

;(Talk to Acomitl, Manyoya, Matahga, or Xueyoni, optional)
:'''Matahga:''' Aw, I lost again. Even after all that practice, I still lost to {{MC|m=him|f=her}}.
:'''Acomitl:''' I told you this ages ago. There's no end to thinking about winning. Gotta admire your drive to just charge ahead without fear, though.
:'''Manyoya:''' Well, you were like that when you were younger, too, following behind me every day, talking about how you wanted to become a master Saurian tamer...
:'''Acomitl:''' Quit teasing me, sis...
:'''Xueyoni:''' You are all good children of mine, and fine warriors, too &mdash; and all warriors must face different challenges at different points...
:'''Xueyoni:''' Which is fine. So long as your consciences are clear, I am proud of you.
