|desc_suspicious = Even the freshest crab roe cannot mask the taste of over-aged tofu. Crushing it up with your chopsticks and mixing it into the white rice is all you can do to force it down your gullet.
|desc_basic      = Crab roe is stir-fried till the oil within oozes out before being added to boiled tofu and accented with broth. Simple, yes, but gloriously fresh.
|desc_delicious  = The tofu is so tender that it might break if you blew on a spoonful of it. Each granule of the crab roe is plump and filled with crab oil that oozes out onto your lips the moment you have a single bite. Chewing is not needed at all. The food travels down your gullet in a flash, leaving nothing but the memory of its fresh flavor
