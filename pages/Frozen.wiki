==Duration==
{{Main|Elemental Gauge Theory/Advanced Aura Mechanics#Frozen}}
<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
:<math>\begin{align}
\text{Gauge}_\text{Freeze Aura} &= 2\min(\text{Gauge}_\text{Origin Aura}, \text{Gauge}_\text{Trigger Element}) \times (1 - \text{Freeze Resistance}_\text{Target})\\
\text{Freeze Duration (Seconds)} &= 2\sqrt{5\times \text{Gauge}_\text{Freeze Aura} + 4} - 4
\end{align}</math>
</div>

===Freeze Resistance===
'''Freeze Resistance''' reduces the Freeze Aura gauge by a certain percentage. Currently, the following enemies have Freeze Resistance:
* {{Enemy|Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents}} (While Shielded): '''80%'''
* {{Enemy|Hydro Hypostasis|text=Hydro Hypostasis Summon}} (Revival Phase): '''40%'''
* {{Enemy|Canine Bunshin}}: '''80%'''
* {{Enemy|Consecrated Flying Serpent}}: '''50%'''
* {{Enemy|Consecrated Red Vulture}}: '''50%'''
* {{Enemy|Consecrated Scorpion}}: '''50%'''

==Shatter==
{{main|Damage#Transformative Reaction Damage}}
'''Shatter''' is triggered when a Frozen target is hit by a [[Blunt Attack|Blunt]] or {{Geo}} attack.

Shattered occurs before any elemental damage, potentially preventing some reactions. However, an underlying element can still persist or be reapplied under the Freeze aura, allowing another reaction to occur after Shatter (ex. [[Let the Show Begin]] > [[Frostgnaw]] > [[Starfell Sword]] will remove the freeze through '''Shatter''' then [[Crystallize]] the [[Hydro]] effect underneath). See [[Elemental Gauge Theory/Simultaneous Reaction Priority]] for more information.

==Environment==
===Water===
In the open world, portions of most bodies of [[water]] can be Frozen by Cryo attacks. Frozen water can be stood on by both characters and enemies. This ice can be [[Melt]]ed instantly and can cause [[Superconduct]] when near [[Electro-Charged]] water or when attacked with Electro.

The Frozen water's duration is determined by the amount of Cryo [[gauge unit]]s that an ability applies. Frozen water duration is calculated as:
:<math>\text{Frozen Water Duration (Seconds)} = \min(\text{Gauge}_\text{Cryo Attack}, 3.2) \times 2.5</math>

Therefore, '''1U''' Cryo attacks freeze water for '''2.5s''', '''2U''' Cryo attacks freeze water for '''5s''', and '''4U''' Cryo attacks (currently exclusive to [[Kaeya]]'s [[Frostgnaw]]) freeze water for '''8s'''.

The [[Cryo Slime]] and [[Cryo Abyss Mage]] apply '''3.2U''' of Cryo to nearby water, also creating ice that lasts for '''8s'''.

===Other Objects===
Certain other entities can also be Frozen. Entities that originate from a character, such as [[Baron Bunny]] and [[Ushi]] from [[Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst!]], can be Frozen by applications of Hydro and Cryo that do not come from the player, such as enemy attacks and water. Entities that do not originate from a character can be Frozen by players. However, entities that change state upon receiving damage, such as [[Exploding Barrel]]s and [[Boom Blossom]]s, can only be Frozen without changing state with damageless applications of Hydro and Cryo, such as those of [[Let the Show Begin♪]] and [[Kamisato Art: Senho]].

==Tutorial==
{{See also|Elemental Trial}}
[[File:Tutorial Elemental Trial Frozen 1.png|200px|thumb|left]]
When {{Cryo}} meets {{Hydro}}, the Frozen reaction is triggered. Frozen beings are rendered immobile.
[[File:Tutorial Elemental Trial Frozen 2.png|200px|thumb|left]][[File:Tutorial Elemental Trial Frozen 3.png|200px|thumb|left]]
Use {{Hydro}} attacks in battle to make opponents Wet. Then, switch to a {{Cryo}} character and use {{Cryo}} attacks to trigger Frozen to control your opponents effectively.
