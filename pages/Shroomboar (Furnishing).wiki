|description    = A forest boar that dwells in the rainforest. This creature has developed a certain marvelous symbiosis with the Shroom-Kin.<br>According to researchers' studies, Shroomboars rely on the parasitic mushrooms perched on them for natural camouflage, which allows them to evade predators and survive in the jungles.<br>If kept in a space with lush vegetation, perhaps these forest boars can attract butterflies and birds with their unique appearance and form mobile gardens in the Realm Within.
