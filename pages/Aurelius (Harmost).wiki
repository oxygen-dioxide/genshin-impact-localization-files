'''Aurelius''' was a historical character from [[Fontaine]] and one of the four [[Harmost]]s of [[Remuria]].

==Profile==
Aurelius preferred to not use violence when conquering tribes for Remuria, instead simply announcing the news of conquest and annexing them into the empire.<ref>Interactable: [[Faded Castle#Investigation of the Northern Barbarians|Investigation of the Northern Barbarians]]</ref> He was the Harmost who promoted [[Boethius]], as well as the person who originally divided all things into four categories.<ref>Interactable: [[Collegium Phonascorum#Harmost's Notes (II)|Harmost's Notes (II)]]</ref> His research and theories would eventually be used by the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]].

===Appearance===
''(To be added.)''

==Story==
Aurelius's death came when traitors on Remuria's imperial flagship sank the ship with him on it. His final resting place is unknown.<ref>Interactable: [[Alta Semita#Ancient Engravings|Ancient Engravings]]</ref>

In modern [[Fontaine]], there is a trilogy of plays called "The Saga of Aurelius". However, it is believed that the main character is completely fictional and has no historical counterpart.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Silvershower Heartstrings|Lore}}</ref>
