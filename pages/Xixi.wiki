==Dialogue==
===Before "Transient Dreams"===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xixi:''' Haaa... Atchoo! Hmm? Do you need something?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Xixi:''' This is the [[International Trade Association]].
::'''Xixi:''' ...
::'''Xixi:''' ...Hmm? What else do you want?
::{{DIcon}} What can I do here?
::'''Xixi:''' Hmm. The International Trade Association used to be a gathering place for foreign traders. Everyone would come here to mingle and exchange business news. It was a bustling place.
::'''Xixi:''' As for now... because of the lockdown, foreign traders have become a rare sight in Inazuma. As you can see, it's all much quieter now.
::'''Xixi:''' Those merchants who need help would probably just visit [[Kurisu]] directly.
::{{DIcon}} About Kurisu...
::'''Xixi:''' President Kurisu is very reliable! Every outlander on Ritou can count on him.
::'''Xixi:''' He's been living in Inazuma for a long time, after all. He has all sorts of secret resources...
::'''Xixi:''' Oh no, I'm talking too much! Um, you didn't hear that...
::'''Xixi:''' Well... Anyway, even if you aren't a merchant, you can still ask Kurisu for help. As outlanders, we all have to look after each other here... That's what he always tells us.
::'''Xixi:''' For a fellow outlander like yourself, I believe the President will definitely welcome you with open arms if you ever find yourself in trouble. Yeah.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Xixi:''' Hoo... Goodbye...
{{Dialogue End}}

===After "Transient Dreams"===

:'''Xixi:''' Haaa... Atchoo! Hmm? Do you need something?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Xixi:''' This is the International Trade Association.
::'''Xixi:''' ...
::'''Xixi:''' ...Hmm? What else do you want?
::{{DIcon}} What can I do here?
::'''Xixi:''' Hmm. The International Trade Association is a gathering place for foreign traders. Everyone comes here to mingle and exchange business news.
::'''Xixi:''' Lately the number of outlander merchants has increased greatly, and so the number who need help has also gone up.
::'''Xixi:''' I've been so busy that I haven't slept well the past few nights, *yawn*
::'''Xixi:''' Still, I'm only doing some of the simpler reception work. For more details, it'd be best if you asked Kurisu.
::{{DIcon}} About Kurisu...
::'''Xixi:''' President Kurisu is very reliable! Every outlander on Ritou can count on him.
::'''Xixi:''' He's been living in Inazuma for a long time, after all. He has all sorts of secret resources...

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing [[The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture]])
:'''Xixi:''' *yawn*
:'''Xixi:''' Gah, I burned several nights reading the books I bought during the festival. What did they call them again? "Fan novels"? Yeah, that's what they called them. And I've got to say, I got more confused the more I read them.
:'''Xixi:''' In this one, these two people got together in the end, But in that one, they separated...
:'''Xixi:''' But they're the same characters, right? Then why did the stories end differently? I don't get it.
