'''''Arayesh's Jam''''' is a weekly [[Reputation Request]] that occurs in [[Sumeru]].

==Steps==
# Give two jars of [[Jam]] to [[Arayesh]]

==Request Details==
Help Needed:<br>I have a habit of having some handmade jam and cake every workday morning.<br>
This has been a consistent practice of mine for years, and whenever I fail to do it, I feel terrible all morning.<br>
Now, I'm a pretty good hand at dying hair, but I'm terrible at making jam.<br>
So if there's someone out there who's a dab hand at whipping up some {{Color|buzzword|Jam}}, could you make {{Color|buzzword|2 jars}} and bring them to my barbershop?
