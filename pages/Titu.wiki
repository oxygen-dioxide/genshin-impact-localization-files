;(If [[An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty]] has not been completed)
:'''Titu:''' Ah, it's you, mighty {{Traveler}}! How are things going? Have you gone on another adventure? If you've heard any more amazing stories, I'm all ears!
:'''Titu:''' Tell you what, I've got a brother at the Saurian Relics Association. Name's [[Manqu]], and man, if I told him what we saw at the Shadow Pins...
:'''Titu:''' He'd go so green with envy, it might kill him! Gonna wait till I get back from my post to break it to him, though.
:{{DIcon}} About marked [[Saurian]] young...
::'''Titu:''' You mean {{Little One}}? Well, all I know is that it's not a good sign.
::'''Titu:''' I've heard that such marked Saurians are rejected by the [[Night Kingdom]], the tribes, and the Saurians too. They die as they lived, alone.
::'''Titu:''' But that's just superstition. I mean, {{Little One}}'s got you, right?
:{{DIcon}} About the tales of those heroes...
::'''Titu:''' I'm giving it some thought. Uh, not that I'd let it affect my sentry work, though, no sir! I'm a real multitasker.
::'''Titu:''' Those two from [[Khaenri'ah]] have a terrible reputation here in the tribe. All the more reason for my story to be as exciting as possible!
::'''Titu:''' So yeah, I've got to give this all the consideration it's due!
:{{DIcon}} About storytellers...
::'''Titu:''' We're an amazing bunch, we are!
::'''Titu:''' Take, for example... Sanhaj from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], whom all storytellers revere...
::'''Titu:''' They said he had every scroll written up to his time committed to memory, and that he was willing to go from tribe to tribe and share those tales... That said, they also say that he often tricked people, mooching food and drink off them.
::'''Titu:''' Stories speak of bygone times, and they represent the wisdom of our forebears. Thus, the mere act of sharing it was seen as a selfless act, so all both loved and hated cunning Sanhaj.
::'''Titu:''' Later, that tale-telling hero would himself become part of a heroic tale &mdash; a fate I doubt even he ever envisioned... But yeah. Sanhaj was an amazing storyteller.
::'''Titu:''' Still, the characters in his tales were all tribal warriors of a sort, but in mine, we'll also include a golden-haired outlander, a silver-haired fairy, and a little Saurian with a red scarf.
::'''Titu:''' So, if only in terms of the variety of main characters, I'm the winner here!
:{{DIcon}} I saw you in [[Ochkanatlan]]...
:;(Available after completing [[Lost Traveler in the Ashen Realm]])
::'''Titu:''' What? Me? ... Haha, you must be joking. "I've" never been there, that's for sure. "I" am simply a storyteller from the Children of Echoes.
::'''Titu:''' "Titu" is just a name. Anyone could be called "Titu." Perhaps the one you saw was someone using that name...
::'''Titu:''' Hehe, and that makes me another who is using it, of course.
:{{DIcon}} See you! Guard your post well!
::'''Titu:''' Alright, alright. See you, {{Traveler}}.

;(If [[An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty]] has been completed)
:'''Titu:''' Hmmm... I... can't believe that happened... It's almost as if I've had a long, long dream.
:'''Titu:''' Strange... I am not someone who should have appeared in the "present"... Sorry, I know you might not understand, but I... have had many pasts, so many memories of lives led... But none of them "me."
:'''Titu:''' The life of the one named "Titu" was akin to a dream in which he could not control his own body, a dream from which he has only just awakened... Only now does he hear the Lord of the Night's call...
:'''Titu:''' Was this... your doing? That sense of being controlled has faded. Hmm... Yes. Perhaps this shall be the final life of the one named "Titu."
:'''Titu:''' Thank you, outlander hero... Haha. Let's live this life out in peace, shall we? Being a storyteller sounds pretty sweet in that regard...

==Trivia==
* {{W|Titu Cusi}} was the ruler of the Incan city of {{W|Vilcabamba}} and the {{W|Neo-Inca State}}.
* Due to sharing a similar name and model with the Titu seen in [[Och-Kan]]'s memories during [[Moment of Awakening]] and his added dialogue after completing the quest, it is implied that this Titu may be a disguise of [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]].
