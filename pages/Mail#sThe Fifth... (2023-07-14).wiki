|text      = My subordinates are always advising me to take a day off and rest. I suppose they are right. A bowstring cannot be kept taut forever.

In order to efficiently execute my day of rest, I have drawn up a schedule with time for five activities, and I would like to invite you to carry them out with me. Furthermore, I would also like your input regarding the items:

First is making offerings. The perfect day begins with the upkeep of the Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder.

Second is training. Proper exercise soothes the spirit.

Third is patrolling. We must carry out surveillance of Inazuma streets and eliminate any potential dangers.

Fourth is sparring. Exchanging blows with a fighter as strong as yourself is always a great pleasure. Having written this much, I discovered that the aforementioned four items are little different from my daily routine, and seem at odds with my original intent in drafting this document.

In that case, I leave the fifth item up to you. Whether going to the Aisa Bathhouse to wash away the aches and pains of sparring, or going to Uyuu Restaurant for a full meal, I will be by your side, accompanying you.
