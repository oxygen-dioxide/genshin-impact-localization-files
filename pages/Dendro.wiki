'''Dendro''' is one of the seven [[Elements]].

The element's associated archon is [[Kusanali|Lesser Lord Kusanali]], whose domain is [[Sumeru]]. Currently, there are no playable Dendro characters in the game.

==Elemental Reactions==
{{Dendro}} has the following [[Elemental Reactions]]:

*{{Icon/Element|Pyro}} '''[[Burning]]:''' Deals {{Color|Pyro DMG}} over time in a small AoE and applies Pyro to nearby targets.

Two elemental reactions, [[Bloom]] and [[Catalyze]], are expected to come with the [[Version 3.0]] update, after the release of Sumeru.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/6DjVUfy_Lng Sumeru Preview Teaser 01: The Fascinating Dendro Element | Genshin Impact]</ref>

==Dendro Status==
Unlike other Elements, taking {{Color|Dendro DMG}} will not apply a Dendro status. However, certain abilities such as the green field summoned by [[Dendro Samachurl]]s or poison clouds from [[Large Dendro Slime]]s are capable of applying the Dendro status. The {{Dendro}} status effect does not have any other effects; it is considered simply as the application of the {{Dendro}} element.
