|So this Nathan fellow disguised himself as a fellow "freedom fighter," armed with slogans that were easy to identify with... and with an ice-cold heart, with which he pushed our most radical groups onto a path from which there was no returning...

Nathan was an agent of the Fatui sent by [[Pierro]]<ref name="CH">{{Ref/Quest|Clean House}}</ref> to infiltrate the Watatsumi Army to dash their hopes for a quick victory, and thus drag out the war between them and the Shogunate,<ref>{{Ref/Domain|Delusion Factory|note=Hall Notice}}</ref> using a cover story that he joined because he hailed from [[Mondstadt]], the City of Freedom, and thus did not agree with the [[Shogunate]]'s oppressive regime. At some point in time, he became involved with certain [[Orobashi]] fanatics who sought to restore the "glory" of their slain god. He researched the [[Raiden Shogun|Shogun's]] wards on [[Yashiori Island]] and devised a way to break them, something the plan's members believed would restore Orobashi's "dignity." This plan was neither devised nor approved by the Resistance leader, [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]], and those in on the plan did not want her to be implicated in their scheme in the event that they were caught.<ref>Interactible: [[Serpent's Head#Waterlogged Note|Waterlogged Note]]</ref> Breaking the wards instead unleashed the [[Tatarigami]], causing people on the island to fall ill or go mad.

When the Fatui's involvement with the resistance was revealed, the factory in which the [[Delusion]]s were made was raided by the resistance and papers were seized that revealed him as a double agent. Nathan attempted to flee Inazuma in the aftermath but was captured by the resistance. He is currently imprisoned and awaiting trial.<ref name="CH" />

===Personality===
Allegedly hailing from Mondstadt, Nathan claimed to be a supporter of freedom and chose to fight for the Watatsumi Army for this reason. In actuality, he is a deceptive double agent working for the Fatui and sought to create chaos during the war between the Shogunate and Watatsumi Army to further increase the Fatui's influence.

===Appearance===
Nathan wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Nathan is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'', whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nathan:''' Why, I never! To think there'd be an outlander like me here.
:'''Nathan:''' This place really is the top pick if you're here to travel. Take good care of yourself, now. The situation here is very unstable.
:{{DIcon}} Ah, so you're an outlander as well?
::'''Nathan:''' I'm from Mondstadt. My travel brings me to Inazuma.
::'''Nathan:''' I've witnessed the tyranny of the Shogunate and the sufferings of its people. Such things would've never been condoned in my hometown, Mondstadt.
::'''Nathan:''' That's why I joined up with the Sangonomiya resistance and pledged to fight for freedom.
::{{DIcon}} How's the situation right now?
:::'''Nathan:''' Though I am a part of the resistance, if I'm to be frank about the situation, both sides have their strengths.
:::'''Nathan:''' The Shogunate is better trained, organized and equipped. However, the Sangonomiya troops have unwavering morale and determination, and the people are extremely united.
:::'''Nathan:''' Don't underestimate the will of the people. Even though the resistance can muster fewer troops and is outmatched in equipment on the battlefield, we still believe that we have a fighting chance.
::{{DIcon}} Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
:::'''Nathan:''' Me? Ehh, I'm just an ordinary person from Mondstadt. I've never gotten any training, nor was I a knight.
:::'''Nathan:''' If you've been to Mondstadt, you'd know we lead a very laid back lifestyle.
:::'''Nathan:''' Personally I can't accept the Shogunate's way of stripping others of their freedom. That's the reason why I'm so concerned about the current situation.
:::'''Nathan:''' Still, it's not like I've made a huge difference by joining the Sangonomiya faction either. I just try to help out as much as I can, haha.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nathan:''' Farewell, Traveler, and may the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]] protect you.
