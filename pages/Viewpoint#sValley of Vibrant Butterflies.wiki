|text    = An [[adeptus]]'s abode, far from the din of mortal comings and goings. In the distant past, it is said that the ancestral peoples who had lost their home due to war were taken in by an adeptus named [[Fujin]], and here did they avoid the disaster that raged without. Thus did the flame of civilization endure rather than be snuffed out under titanic floods.
