'''Tubby''' the [[Teapot Spirit]] is an open-world [[NPC]] found in the [[Serenitea Pot]]. Her location is indicated by the [[File:UI Tubby.png|25x25px]] icon on the map. Talking to her will allow players access to [[Trust Rank]], Create Furnishing, Switch Realm Style, Realm Depot, and other features of the Serenitea Pot. Tubby's functions are also available in the "Tubby" tab that is accessed from interacting with the white pot icon on the top right of the screen.

She discusses the [[Sub-Space Creation]] adeptal power with the Traveler and recalls how she once met a golden-eyed [[adeptus]].

==Trivia==
* It is possible [[Ganyu]] has met Tubby before the creation of the [[Traveler]]'s Serenitea Pot, as she refers to her as Rain Calmer during some of her dialogue, even if Tubby has not yet reached a rank where she has remembered her Adeptus name.
* It is possible the "Golden-eyed Adeptus" that Tubby remembers meeting, mentioned in the {{Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part II}}, was [[Rex Lapis]], as he is known to have the same, golden-amber coloured eyes regardless of which vessel he takes.
