==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Wrench Wang is in charge of the repairs at the shipyard. He is nicknamed Wrench Wang by his fellow peers, with his real name unknown.

Wrench Wang and [[Siyu]], his childhood sweetheart, both grew up by the sea.<ref name="Siyu"/> The two were frequent troublemakers, often resulting in lectures from the adults. Wrench Wang has always treated Siyu fairly, sharing food with her and even teaching her arithmetic.<ref name="Siyu"/> At some point, Siyu gave Wrench Wang a handkerchief which he still holds dear.

While Siyu carried out her dream of marrying a Prince Charming, Wrench Wang joined the fleet for a few years and returned to the shipyards, thereon renown as the best repairman the docks has ever seen.

===Personality===
In the past, Wrench Wang and Siyu were troublemakers. Wrench Wang was initially a gloomy man, likening his past self to [[Hammer Li]], but brightened thanks to many circumstances, including Siyu's efforts. However gloomy he may have been, he's always treated Siyu with great care.

At present, Wrench Wang is a cheerful, charismatic, and talkative man, always posing himself as an optimistic and approachable person. He is known for his strength and is willing to help others, valuing both his job and the memories of his crew.

With reasons unknown to Siyu, Wrench Wang and her husband seemingly do not get along. Wrench Wang still holds Siyu dear in his heart, and even bringing her up again results in him crying, regretting the fact that he didn't confess when it wasn't too late.

===Appearance===
Wrench Wang is a muscular man with short and ruffled hazel hair, and gray-green eyes, framed by thick eyebrows. He wears a dark teal shirt, with a white vest patterned with grey stripes and baby blue boarders. His dark blue pants, held together by a black belt are loose and cut off just above his ankles, with white leggings underneath. He wears dark blue cuffs on him, lining up below his elbows. His shoes, nearly the same shade as his hair, are low with a short toebox.

==Dialogue==
{{dialogue start}}
:'''Wrench Wang:''' Ahoy, there. Has your ship sprung a leak?
:'''Wrench Wang:''' Fixing ships is certainly cheaper than buying new ones, hahaha!
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Wrench Wang:''' I'm in charge of repairs here in the shipyard. Everyone calls me Wrench Wang.
::'''Wrench Wang:''' That's not me real name, mind you. Although it sounds a bit foolish, if that's what everyone likes to call me, then so be it! Hahaha!
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about making boat repairs.
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Even if your vessel is on its way to the bottom, I can still fix it &mdash; just as long as you're not going down with it, hahaha!
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Repairing ships is much more interesting than building them. What I'm working on isn't just the ship itself, it's also the memories of its crew.
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Even if a ship is completely refitted from the hull to its rigging, it'll still feel like the same old ship that you've always known.
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Just like the handkerchief [[Siyu]] gave me. Even though it's full of patches, I'd never trade it for a new one.
:::{{DIcon}} Who is Siyu?
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Siyu's my childhood sweetheart. We were always stirring up trouble together, and the adults would always give us an earful, hahaha!
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' After we grew up, I joined the fleet for a few years before returning to the shipyards as the best repairman these docks have ever seen!
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' As for her, she fulfilled her dreams of becoming the bride of a real Prince Charming.
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' They say that time waits for nobody, and nothin' is more true for childhood sweethearts, hahahaha...
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' ...
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Oh, look's like me eyes have sprung a leak. Apologies, must be that salty sea breeze, haha...
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Agh, clearly she should have been mine... *cries*
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Shipyard.
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' This shipyard bears the brunt of all the boat repair and maintenance work in all of Liyue Harbor.
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' I'm a maintenance man myself. See that gloomy-looking guy with the hammer over there? That's [[Hammer Li]], he works on the shipbuilding side.
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' I can't recommend trying to strike up a conversation with him. He can never find anything positive to say...
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' If you ask me, he should come with me to see one of [[Xinyan]]'s performances!
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' That would get the blood pumping through his veins and inject a little passion into his heart, trust me! Hahaha!
::{{DIcon}} Does everyone in the shipyard laugh as much as you?
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Oh, I used to be just like Hammer Li the shipbuilder over there, always flying a stern look on his face.
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' But just like Siyu always said, nothing solves difficult problems like a good night's sleep. Every day has a new horizon, hahaha!
:::'''Wrench Wang:''' Siyu's smile and encouraging words always put wind in my sails. She made me feel like there was no storm I couldn't weather, hahaha!
:::{{DIcon}} Who is Siyu?
::;(Repeats response as the first branch's "Who is Siyu?")
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye..
::'''Wrench Wang:''' Safe voyage to ya, don't squander your youth!
