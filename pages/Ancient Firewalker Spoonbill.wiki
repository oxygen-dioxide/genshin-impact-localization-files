|description = A bird capable of freely swimming through [[Liquid Phlogiston|liquid Phlogiston]].<br>Having lived in volcanoes, its habits and appearance differ from Spoonbills found in the outside world. Some scholars posit that the Ancient Firewalker Spoonbill is to the [[Blue Mountain Spoonbill]] what the [[Flowfire Bird]] is to the [[Flowcurrent Bird]]. Others believe the Ancient Firewalker Spoonbill predates them all... If true, then it would seem that the Spoonbill species has always been of this size since time immemorial.
