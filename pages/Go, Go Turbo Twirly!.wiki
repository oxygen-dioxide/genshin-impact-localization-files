{{Description|Turbo Twirly only looks like a top — it is, in fact, a drill that can split even the strongest rock asunder!}}
'''Go, Go Turbo Twirly!''' is [[Kachina]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|0.667}}
** This particle generation can only trigger once per '''0.2''' seconds.
* Turbo Twirly Independent DMG is triggered once every '''2''' seconds.
* Kachina's Nightsoul's Blessing state will not end when switching, and Turbo Twirly will remain in the independent mode. When Kachina is off-fielded, her Nightsoul point indicator appears below her HP bar in the [[party]] setup UI.
* When attempting to mount Turbo Twirly, Kachina will jump on the existing one if the distance is less than '''5m''' and there is no obstacle. Otherwise, she will summon a new Turbo Twirly and mount it.
* Kachina can slam Turbo Twirly once every '''0.5''' seconds.
* Turbo Twirly Mounted DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG, but the slamming animation is considered a Normal Attack animation and will trigger dependent effects such as [[Xingqiu]]'s [[Guhua Sword: Raincutter|Rainbow Bladework]] and [[Thoma]]'s [[Crimson Ooyoroi|Fiery Collapse]].
* Kachina is not prevented from doing idles while riding Turbo Twirly. When she does an idle, she dismounts from Turbo Twirly.
