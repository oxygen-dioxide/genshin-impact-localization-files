==Profile==
Toe is a dockworker willing to be hired for work for the [[Rite of Parting]].

While willing to negotiate his hiring rate, he will get angry if the [[Traveler]] continuously lowballs an offer. He will also initially refuse to go pick up his payment from [[Childe]] himself, citing that it's not worth it without a detour fee. After receiving the fee, he will guarantee the work to be done before picking up payment.

===Personality===
Toe is a reserve member of the [[Adventurers' Guild]], who takes adventuring commissions and "nothing clerical". When the traveler asks for Crystalflies, he comments that it's almost "a bit too easy" for a reserve adventurer.
His detour fee is a piece of [[Iron Chunk|Iron Ore]], either as a weapon or for forging weapons as he states that a trusty weapon is always necessary for an adventurer.
