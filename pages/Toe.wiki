==Profile==
Toe is a dockworker willing to be hired for work for the [[Rite of Parting]].

While willing to negotiate his hiring rate, he will get angry if the [[Traveler]] continuously lowballs an offer. He will also initially refuse to go pick up his payment from [[Childe]] himself, citing that it's not worth it without a detour fee. After receiving the fee, he will guarantee the work to be done before picking up payment.
