==Steps==
# Investigate the strange ice
#* The [[Ancient Rime|strange ice]] is located next to a {{Enemy|Frostarm Lawachurl}}, near the first waypoint from Dragonspine Adventurer Camp.
#* Use the nearby [[Scarlet Quartz]] on the ice four times to thaw it.
#* Activate the Orb to unlock the [[Frostbearing Tree]].
# Continue upwards to investigate
# Thaw all the shards out (1/3)
#* Entombed City Outskirts (2nd waypoint south from Dawn Winery's Statue of The Seven)
#** Activate the device and watch the [[Warming Seelie]] go to the 5 Cryo Totems.
#** Activate the 5 totems in the same order using a Cryo character.
#** Open the {{item|Precious Chest}} and defeat the enemies that spawn afterward:
#*** Wave 1: {{Enemy List|Ruin Guard*2}}
#*** Wave 2: {{Enemy List|Ruin Grader}}
#*** A snowstorm begins at the start of the fight that accelerates [[Sheer Cold]]. During the fight, only 1 of the 4 [[Ruin Brazier]]s will be active at any one time.
#** Glide down into the cavern. Guide the floating Warming Seelie to its garden.
#** Free the 2nd Warming Seelie from the ice near the stele with [[Ancient Carvings]].
#** Use the nearby Scarlet Quartz on the ice four times to thaw it.
#** Activate the Orb after thawing the ice. {{Enemy|Ruin Grader|x=2}} will spawn. The entrance near the Seelie will open up, leading to a passage with some [[Starsilver]] ores.
#* Starglow Cavern (waypoint southwest of [[Peak of Vindagnyr]] domain)
#** Head east from the waypoint, glide down, and continue east to the cavern with the strange ice.
#** Complete the [[Time Trial Challenge]] at the bottom of the cavern. This consists of four waves that must be cleared in 3 minutes:
#*** Wave 1: {{Enemy List|Cryo Hilichurl Shooter*2;Cryo Hilichurl Grenadier*1}}
#*** Wave 2: {{Enemy List|Cryo Hilichurl Shooter*3;Cryo Samachurl*1}}
#*** Wave 3: {{Enemy List|Cryo Hilichurl Shooter*2;Cryo Samachurl*2}}
#*** Wave 4: {{Enemy List|Cryo Abyss Mage*3}}
#*** During this challenge, icicles will continually fall from above. It is recommended to find the three Warming Seelies and guide them to the courts before attempting the challenge.
#** Use the nearby Scarlet Quartz on the ice four times to thaw it.
#** Activate the Orb after thawing the ice.
# Head for Dragonspine's summit
#* Go to the Statue of The Seven and head south, then west.
#* Follow the Warming Seelie at the hilichurl camp to reach the [[Skyfrost Nail]] subarea.
# Thaw all the shards out again (3 shards)
#* Break the first shard
#** From the Skyfrost Nail waypoint, break the Scarlet Quartz near an inactive Ruin Guard.
#** Go further up the circular slope and use an archer to shoot the 1st glowing shard floating in the sky.
#* Break the second shard
#** Head up the slope to a heat beacon in a field of icy grass.
#** Go north and defeat the {{Enemy|Frostarm Lawachurl}}. This Lawachurl will call in {{Enemy|Cryo Hilichurl Shooter}}s as reinforcements, all of whom will despawn when the Lawachurl is killed.
#** Break the Scarlet Quartz near the 3 chests.
#** Go back to the cliff near the heat beacon and shoot the 2nd shard floating in the sky.
#* Break the third shard
#** Follow the Warming Seelie from the icy grass field to an {{Anemo}} [[Monument]] on the cliff above.
#** Activate the Anemo Monument, then glide up the wind current and use the wind rings to reach a hilichurl camp.
#** Break the Scarlet Quartz in the hilichurl camp.
#** Glide down onto one of the floating platforms and shoot the 3rd shard. The player can also activate the other 2 Orbs before shooting the 3rd shard if quick enough. Otherwise, shoot the 3rd shard first, then go back and glide down to activate all the Orbs.
#* Activate all the Orbs revealed by the broken shards.
# Investigate the area below
#* Open the {{item|Luxurious Chest}} with the red aura.
#** This will grant access to the [[Peak of Vindagnyr]] domain.
#* There are also 3 {{item|Precious Chest|text=Precious Chests}} and 1 {{item|Exquisite Chest}} near the entrance of the domain.
# Report back to Iris
#* The {{enemy|Cryo Hypostasis}} will become available after this step.

==Gameplay Notes==
* All attacks from a character with the Scarlet Quartz effect active are able to melt the [[Ancient Rime|ice shards]].
** This includes '''bow''' and '''catalyst''' attacks, {{Physical}} and any [[Element|Elemental]] attacks (not only {{Pyro}}).
* Completing this quest will grant the {{Achievement|Skyfrost Nail (Achievement)}}.
* Climbing to the top of Skyfrost Nail after it's restored will grant the {{Achievement|Sky High}}.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|At the adventurer camp, [[Iris (Dragonspine Adventurer Camp)|Iris]] informs you that there seems to be some bizarrely hard ice blocking the paths into the mountains...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Iris)
;(Only plays after completing [[Low-Temperature Warning]], by choosing a non-quest dialogue option, then talking to her again.)
:'''Iris:''' This is a sticky situation, indeed...
:{{DIcon|Quest}} How are things here on Dragonspine?
:'''Iris:''' On this mountain? Well, I can only say that it's more dangerous than any other place in Mondstadt.
:'''Iris:''' Apart from the harsh conditions, this mountain is also home to some strange... ice.
:'''Iris:''' It is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire.
:'''Iris:''' Worst of all, a few roads have been blocked by this ice.
:'''Iris:''' Quite a few of our expedition teams have been forced to turn back after being blocked by ice barricades that they could not get around.
:'''Iris:''' *sigh* I wonder when we're going to find a way to get rid of that ice...
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I'll have a look at it.
:'''Iris:''' You're just going to have a look, right? If so, I remember that there was a large slab of ice of that kind on the mountain's outer boundaries. Who knows what's frozen inside it...
:'''Iris:''' You could have a look around there, but remember, it's best not to come this way again.

;(Talk to Iris again)
:{{DIcon}} So, tell me about the ice.
:'''Iris:''' If you'd just like to have a look at the ice, you can just go to the place that I mentioned. For your own safety, don't go any further into the mountain.
----
;(Approach the Frostbearing Tree)
:'''Paimon:''' What a huge block of ice... Can you see what's stuck inside?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, what's up with all this blue grass around here? So strange...

;(After unlocking the Frostbearing Tree)
:'''Paimon:''' Eek! That thing just flew up into the air... Looked like it was going towards the mountain's summit.
:'''Paimon:''' Shall we go and have a look around? Or should we go back and ask someone about the situation?

;(Upon reaching the area leading to the summit)
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;S&mdash;So cold... P&mdash;Paimon's turning into a Paimon popsicle!
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What's... going on here...
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;We should go back and ask around at the camp in the foothills...
----
{{Quest Description|update|The cavern leading up to the summit has been blocked by a mysterious air current that renders it impassible. Head down to the camp in the foothills to ask around. Perhaps someone might have a clue as to your next course of action.}}
;(Report back to Iris)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} This mountain really is a dangerous place...
:'''Iris:''' Oh? You're back? How did it go? Did you see the ice&mdash; Huh. You're in... quite a state, aren't you?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Do you know anything about the air current in the cavern?
:'''Iris:''' You've already been that high up? That's very impressive. Still... a cavern blocked by a strange air current, you say? Let me think...
:'''Iris:''' Ah, that reminds me. We did have an adventure team that also got lucky enough to reach a point very high up the mountain.
:'''Iris:''' They couldn't get close enough, but they did they <!--in-game typo-->report that a cavern near the summit did have a strange and powerful air current flowing out from it.
:'''Iris:''' But logically speaking, no air current in such a place should be that strong. No one knows the reason why, either...
:'''Iris:''' Apart from that strange air current, this mountain is also home to some very strange ice.
:'''Iris:''' This ice is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire. It has proved a major obstacle to our exploration as a result.
:'''Iris:''' We have been unable to find a way to deal with that ice, so we've had to go around it...
:'''Iris:''' What's more, blue plants are often found growing near this ice.
:'''Iris:''' I could vaguely see that there was something encased within the ice. But since I was unable to melt it, catching a glimpse of it was as far as I got.
:'''Iris:''' If you're interested, you can follow the trail of blue plants to have a look at that ice.
:'''Iris:''' Let me think... I believe that the {{Color|buzzword|Entombed City Outskirts}} and {{Color|buzzword|Starglow Cavern}} are home to many of those blue plants. You can go and check them out.
:'''Iris:''' A strange, powerful air current, bizarre ice, and odd plants...
:'''Iris:''' Hahaha, if this was your standard tale of adventure, there would be some link between these three.
:'''Iris:''' But in real life, it's best to be practical when adventuring... Make sure you prepare yourself sufficiently before heading up Dragonspine, you hear?

;(Talk to Iris again)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} So, tell me about the ice.
:'''Iris:''' Perhaps you've already noticed, but that slab of ice is surrounded by a great many blue plants.
:'''Iris:''' I believe that those plants may be related in some way to the shard frozen in the ice.
:'''Iris:''' If you wish to continue looking for those shards on Dragonspine, I'd say that you might have some luck following the trail of those blue plants.
:'''Iris:''' I believe that the {{Color|buzzword|Entombed City Outskirts}} and {{Color|buzzword|Starglow Cavern}} are home to many of those blue plants. You can go and check them out. Perhaps you might discover something.
----
{{Quest Description|update|The first shard flew up and away after being thawed out... According to Iris, there are two other shards here on [[Dragonspine]]. If you follow the strange blue plants, you may be able to find more shards of this sort around the {{Color|buzzword|Entombed City Outskirts}} and {{Color|buzzword|Starglow Cavern}}.}}

;(After unlocking the second mechanism and waking the Ruin Guards)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, be careful! Those big guys look like they're waking up...
:'''Paimon:''' It's so cold... That light over there, it looks like some kind of {{Color|buzzword|heat source}}...

;(Traveling inside the fallen ice)
:'''Paimon:''' What a huge block of ice... Can you see what's stuck inside?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, what's up with all this blue grass around here? So strange...

;(Upon entering Starglow Cavern)
:'''Paimon:''' This blue grass grows thick here. Paimon thinks we must be getting closer to something.

;(Approaching the shard in Starglow Cavern)
:'''Paimon:''' So c&mdash;cold...
:'''Paimon:''' Is it because there's no sunlight around here? Or does it have something to do with those {{Color|buzzword|blue plants}} or that {{Color|buzzword|weird ice}}...

;(After thawing all three shards)
:'''Paimon:''' All three shards have thawed out and flown up to the top...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go to the summit and see what the situation there's like.

;(Talk to Iris)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} So, tell me about the ice.
:'''Iris:''' Since we've got a way to melt that ice now, that means I can continue organizing expedition parties to explore the mountain...
----
{{Quest Description|update|Upon thawing the remaining shards out, all the shards flew upwards and away... Perhaps this might have resulted in some changes to the {{Color|buzzword|cavern sealed by the strange air current}}...}}

;(Upon entering the area)
:'''Paimon:''' How are we going to get up this mountain? Hmm, let's try following this road first, shall we?
----
{{Quest Description|update|Following the mountain path, you discover a {{Color|buzzword|Statue of The Seven}}. Beside it, the {{Color|buzzword|path up the mountain}} extends ever on...}}

;(Reaching the summit)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, a giant pillar! What could it be for?
:'''Paimon:''' Up there, aren't those the shards we unfroze? So is this pillar where they came from...?
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like they froze again... Brr, this climate really isn't Paimon-friendly...
:'''Paimon:''' ...But we've got no choice. Let's go unfreeze them again.
----
{{Quest Description|update|You successfully reach Dragonspine's summit from the cavern. However, you see a strange pillar from which those frozen shards seem to have fallen. Those shards also seem to have become frozen once more, requiring you to thaw them out again.}}

;(After thawing the ice shards again)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? The icy surface under the pillar has completely shattered. Looks like there's a huge space underneath it, too. Let's go check it out.

;(After opening the Luxurious Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like there's nothing else here...
:'''Paimon:''' But we should still go back and inform that adventurer.

;(Climb to the top of Skyfrost Nail after being restored)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... This place is incredibly high up.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon has no idea where this pillar might have come from...
:'''Paimon:''' Did it fall down from the sky? How strange...
----
{{Quest Description|update|After unfreezing the three shards and letting them return to that mysterious pillar, the ice surface beneath the pillar broke, revealing a large space underneath... Perhaps you can return to the adventurers at the camp and report what you've seen here on the summit...}}
;(Report back to Iris)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} About the summit...
:'''Iris:''' There's a strange, huge pillar floating in mid-air at the summit? To think that there would be such a thing atop Dragonspine...
:'''Iris:''' And there's a huge space below the ice under the pillar? That's... even weirder.
:'''Iris:''' This is... inconceivable. Thank you. I will send explorers up there as quickly as we can to see what's happening there.
:'''Iris:''' Ah, yes, I should thank you for helping us open the way to the summit. Please take these as thanks.
:'''Iris:''' It seems Dragonspine really does have its secrets after all.
:'''Iris:''' I do hope our next expedition will yield some new discoveries.
