'''Tac''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the [[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter I]]: Act II - [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]], during which he is hired to help with the [[Rite of Parting]]. In this quest, the player must negotiate with Tic to do a day's worth of odd jobs during the [[Rite of Parting]].

Between completing Archon Quest Chapter 1, Act 2 quest [[Downtown]] and starting the Chapter 1, Act 3 quest [[Equilibrium]], he can be found wandering the Yuehai Pavilion and has dialogue.

==Profile==
Tac is a dockworker willing to be hired for work for the [[Rite of Parting]].

While willing to negotiate his hiring rate, he will get angry if the [[Traveler]] continuously lowballs an offer. He will also initially refuse to go pick up his payment from [[Childe]] himself, citing that it's not worth it without a detour fee. After receiving the fee, he will guarantee that he won't be late to start work at Yujing Terrace.

===Personality===
Tac is a man willing to do a day of odd jobs at Yujing Terrace for a fair price. When [[Paimon]] asks for a "Hero of Mondstadt" discount to his rate, he replies that he has never heard of them before.
His detour fee is a high-quality [[Lotus Head]] that he wanted to cook with, citing that it wasn't often that he got to use such fresh and high-end ingredients.

After [[Childe]] paid him enough to work until the end of the Rite of Parting, Tac considers him "not too bad" and "way easier with money" than the Traveler.

===Appearance===
''(To be added.)''

==Trivia==
*[[Tic]], Tac, and [[Toe]] are named after the game {{w|tic-tac-toe}}. They are also connected with the [[achievement]] "[[Ticked, Tacked, and Towed]]".
* His dialogue assumes you reached the dialogue branch for having too little money (which brings up Childe), but also tried bartering with him. This isn't possible during the quest.
