'''Tac''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Farewell, Archaic Lord}}, during which he is hired to help with the [[Rite of Parting]]. In this quest, the player must negotiate with Tac to do a day's worth of odd jobs during the [[Rite of Parting]].

==Profile==
Tac is a dockworker willing to be hired for work for the [[Rite of Parting]].

While willing to negotiate his hiring rate, he will get angry if the [[Traveler]] continuously lowballs an offer. He will also initially refuse to go pick up his payment from [[Childe]] himself, citing that it's not worth it without a detour fee. After receiving the fee, he will guarantee that he won't be late to start work at Yujing Terrace.

==Trivia==
* [[Tic]], Tac, and [[Toe]] are named after the game {{w|tic-tac-toe}}. They are also connected with the [[achievement]] "[[Ticked, Tacked, and Towed]]".
* His dialogue assumes you reached the dialogue branch for having too little money (which brings up Childe), but also tried bartering with him. This isn't possible during the quest.
