<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
On account of the 600,000 [[Mora]] debt their boss owed the Northland Bank, the Wu trio are approached by [[Tartaglia]], only for [[Teucer]] to interrupt as Tartaglia is about to threaten them. To prevent Teucer from learning about his role as one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]], Tartaglia switches to his "toy seller" front while hinting at his original demands to the trio. Taking it to be some strange joke, the three fail to catch on and so Tartaglia decides to pretend to offer to join them, undergoing an initiation test to prove his skills. Wu then informs Tartaglia of a treasure he and his men were unable to take for several days and orders him to acquire it to join the group. Tartaglia easily completes the request in several seconds.

Realizing that they are dealing with an extraordinary individual, the three deliberate amongst themselves. Slick Wu comes to the conclusion that Tartaglia was using insider talk to protect their boss' privacy and reduce the shame of owing money, and the three resolve the matter by promising to return the owed money.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Teucer's Terrific Tour}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*Based on their Chinese names, Slippery Wu is the second-eldest, Slick Wu is the fifth-eldest, and Sneaky Wu is the seventh-eldest in the Wu family. It is unclear whether the Wus are an actual family, or if it is an alias for their Treasure Hoarder enclave.
