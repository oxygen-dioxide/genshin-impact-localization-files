'''Waiz''' is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in {{Quest|Treasure and True Interest}}.

==Profile==
Waiz was a student at Alkami's training center and one of the 20 students assigned to Kaveh's class. Like [[Uzayr]] and [[Tanisha]], he was falsely sold the dream of striking it rich as an architect, and planned to use his riches to "leave his miserable days behind."

Unlike [[Uzayr]] and [[Tanisha]], Waiz has no interest in architecture other than making [[Mora]], and does not return to Alkami's training center after the [[Matra]] closes it down for investigation, with a new boy named [[Shurayh]] appearing instead.

[[Kaveh]] notices his absence and disappointedly makes note of it before announcing that he intends to continue teaching those who remained.
