==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lutine:''' Oh my, I've never seen you before, traveler. Would you like to try some of Merusea Village's specialties?
:{{DIcon}} Local specialties?
::'''Lutine:''' That's right. Let me introduce you. Here, we use ingredients sourced nearby to make delicious dishes that match our tastes.
::'''Lutine:''' I might be tooting my own horn here, but our specialties are well-known amongst niche gourmets!
::'''Lutine:''' [[The Steambird]] even included "trying Merusea Village cuisine" in their "100 Heroic Challenges to Try This Year" feature! We are No.20 on the list!
::'''Lutine:''' Also, I've recently come up with a new dish. Wanna try it out?
::{{DIcon}} (Lutine takes out a dish with a blurry silhouette. The... stimulating scent makes your eyes swell up... This doesn't look edible. You don't think so, anyway.)
::{{DIcon}} You love making, uh, food, do you...
:::'''Lutine:''' Of course! Not to brag or anything, but my food's the best in Merusea Village! I greatly treasure the expressions everyone makes after eating my dishes.
:::'''Lutine:''' Hehe, in fact, I can't wait to see yours. How about it? Would you like to have a go?
:::{{DIcon}} Well, um, cooking should require focus on all aspects, including color and scent...
::::'''Lutine:''' Ooh, you sound like you know a lot about cooking. Cool!
::::'''Lutine:''' All the more reason, then, for you to try my dish out &mdash; it's the culmination of all I know about flavors, scents, and colors!
::::{{DIcon}} Uh, I'm not all that hungry right now, I'm afraid...
:::::'''Lutine:''' *sigh* True, true. If you eat while you're very full, even the most delicious food would seem merely ordinary.
:::::'''Lutine:''' Well then, come back when you're feeling hungry and want to try some Melusine cuisine. Don't forget, now!
::::{{DIcon}} Sure, hit me with it!
:::::{{DIcon}} (Contrary to its appearance, the dish is actually most refreshing. After a single bite, the pungent flavors also become... surprisingly amiable...)
:::::'''Lutine:''' Hehe, there's lots of things you can't know till you try! My food was pretty good, huh? I could tell from your expression!
;(After Step 3 of ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'' and before completing ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Lutine:''' Oh, you mean from just now? Ugh, seriously, it made all the pies I made earlier drop...
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do, so, no thank you.
::'''Lutine:''' Oh well, that's fine. If you've got the time in the future, be sure to come try our authentic cuisine!
