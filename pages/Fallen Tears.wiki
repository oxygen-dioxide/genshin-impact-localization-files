;(After defeating the Ruin Guard)
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't think we'd find Dvalin's tears in a place like this.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' As knights, we are taught to hone our investigative skills.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Very impressive!

;(After obtaining Dvalin's Tear)
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' In my experience, the secret to finding what you are looking for is to never look for it in the first place.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Don't think too much about it and don't search too hard... and before you know it, what you are looking for will appear right before your very eyes.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What?
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Don't worry about it too much. The more flustered you become, the less likely you are to find it.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Pay attention to what you see in your peripheral vision, and you might just stumble upon what you're looking for.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' I don't know... It doesn't sound like that would work...
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' No, seriously, it does though. In fact, it's how I used to find my tortoise whenever he went missing.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wait &mdash; you had a pet tortoise!?
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Yes, why? Something wrong, Paimon?
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, it's... uh, well, just surprising is all.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Why?
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can't imagine Jean having a pet tortoise. Surely you find it hard to imagine too, Master Diluc?
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' No, I don't.
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I had one too when I was a kid. What's so strange about it?
:{{A|vo mdaq057 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You too!?
