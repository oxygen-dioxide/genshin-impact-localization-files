==Profile==
An Su is the butler of Xingqiu's Family, and is quite zealous about his work. He appears in {{Quest|Liyue Celebrates and Eight Adepts Face a Hidden Calamity}}, arriving at the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]] to order a funeral service from [[Hu Tao]] and [[Ferrylady]]. When the [[Traveler]], [[Xiangling]] and [[Lan Yan]] try to visit Hu Tao, they accidentally interrupt the meeting between him and Ferrylady before leaving. An Su recognizes Lan Yan before recalling that she had placed a rattan doll in the patriarch's room, leading him to frantically believe that she had cursed him. In reality, she had done so in order to ward off the [[fetor]] that had accumulated in the room, which was responsible for the patriarch's declining health.
