;(After leaving Liyue Harbor)
:{{A|vo mnlq001 2 cs mona 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Finally.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 2 cs mona 02.ogg}} '''???:''' You kept me waiting so long I almost fell asleep.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 2 cs mona 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Haha, as usual, my astrological predictions are proven correct.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 2 cs mona 04.ogg}} '''???:''' You. Yes you. Come with me.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 2 cs paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Are you some sort of door-to-door fortune teller?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 2 cs paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry, but we're not really interested.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 2 cs mona 05.ogg}} '''???:''' You're not from this world, are you?

;(If the player has not met [[Mona]] before)
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 paimon 01a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' H–How do you know about that?
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 01a 1.ogg}} '''???:''' How? Because I'm a master of true astrology.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 01a 2.ogg}} '''???:''' If you've no other questions, let's be off.
::{{DIcon}} Oh, I'm just full of questions.
::{{DIcon}} For starters, who are you?
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 01a 3.ogg}} '''???:''' *sigh* Fine, I'll exercise a little patience, and explain.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 01a 4.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I am Astrologist Mona Megistus. But considering that it is most rude to misremember names, I allow others to call me Mona.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 01a 5.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I am on a mission from my master to retrieve a certain box from Mondstadt.

;(If the player has already met [[Mona]] through [[The Crisis Deepens]])
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 01b 1.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Does my ability to see through your secrets so easily not evoke any memories?
::{{DIcon}} It's been a while.
::{{DIcon}} You're Mona!
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 paimon 01b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon remembers! You're that astrologist!
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 01b 2.ogg}} '''Mona:''' That's right. It is I, Astrologist Mona Megistus.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 01b 3.ogg}} '''Mona:''' This time, I would like you to come with me to Mondstadt to reclaim a box that belongs to my master.

:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' It was part of an agreement she made with a friend 50 years ago. But she isn't as spry as she used to be, so it's now up to me.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not sure what getting some box back has to do with us. Why do you need us to come along?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Well... that's because I would also like to take on the guardian of the box.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' My master and her friend contended in the mystic arts all their lives without a clear victor. If I triumph here, then I will show myself to be superior to my master!
:{{DIcon}} So you want to prove yourself, huh...
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 05a.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Ahem, well, I want to prove the power and status of astrology, to be precise.
:{{DIcon}} So basically, you want to look good.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 05b.ogg}} '''Mona:''' What are you talking about? The main thing here is to use this chance to prove the power and status of astrology!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But from my predictions, I know that my master's friend has left Mondstadt, leaving her successor as the current guardian of that box.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Like me, that successor must also be the one who has surpassed their teacher. I must not be careless.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But I would prefer to assure my victory in this contest, and upon giving it some thought, you came to mind!
:{{DIcon}} But... I have no idea how astrology works.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 3 paimon 03a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How did she get involved in this anyway?
:{{DIcon}} How did you end up thinking of me?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The knowledge passed down to me from my master must be passed on in turn.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' If I were to bring my disciple to meet her, then the lead is already mine, no?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 11.ogg}} '''Mona:''' And you are Mondstadt's great hero, my equal in status. So...
:{{DIcon}} I refuse.
:{{DIcon}} Since when was I your student?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 12.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Come on, you don't have to actually become my disciple. You just need to act the part.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 13.ogg}} '''Mona:''' There's something in it for you as well, should you come with me to get that box.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 14.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Once I meet that successor and have a chance to exchange knowledge with them, I should be able to read your fate more accurately.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 15.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Then, I will have answers for you, even regarding such distant and foggy matters as gods and kin.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That... that does seem much faster than searching the land country by country!
:{{DIcon}} Those sound like fine conditions.
:{{DIcon}} Well... I guess we'll play along.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 16.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Hehe, a wise decision. Let us be off, then.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 17.ogg}} '''Mona:''' That said, I would like to pay a certain place a visit before we go.
;(After cutscene ends)
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 18.ogg}} '''Mona:''' There is a small inn near {{Color|buzzword|Mt. Tianheng}} that never sees a lot of business, even though its food is always great value for the money.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 3 mona 19.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The owner has always been good to me, so I'd like to say a farewell before I set off.
----
; (At Mr. Zhu's inn)
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Well, it's no wonder that an inn set up here has no business...)
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mrzhu 01.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' Mona, you've come at just the right time. Did you see a jade ring while you made your way here?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' A jade ring? Can't say I have.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mrzhu 02.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' Oh, that's not good... that ring was given to me by my mentor. But while my back was turned, it was swallowed up by a slime!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? That should be no trouble with Mona here. She's really good at astrology...
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Absolutely not. Astrology is meant to be used to gain insight into reality and observe destiny itself. It's certainly not for such mundane affairs.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But didn't you say that the owner here's been good to you?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' This is a matter of pride and one's state of mind. If an astrologist thinks that their arts can solve all problems, they will be forsaken by the starry ether.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Their divinations will lose the power to guide, and will not be able to pierce the fog of the unknown before them. Principles are principles.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Such a powerful ability, and you don't use it to earn a living? What a shame...
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mrzhu 03.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' *sigh* Well, I was going to put up twenty thousand Mora as compensation, if you were willing.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Twenty thousand...!
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
:{{DIcon}} What's with that look on your face?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Oh, ahh, it's nothing! I... I was just thinking that the person who finds that ring must be lucky indeed, to be able to earn twenty thousand Mora just like that.
:{{DIcon}} You were just talking about an astrologist's pride...
:{{DIcon}} Whatever happened to "principles are principles?"
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Ahem. Yes. Of course. Still... the owner's business has had it pretty hard. It must be a truly extraordinary ring, to be worth spending this much Mora to find.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' It wouldn't be right for us to leave like this, so let's help to search for it. There may be other means we can employ besides astrology.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon knows where this is going.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' (Traveler), I know, I'll leave this one to you! This is the first mission I'm giving you as your master!
:{{DIcon}} But of course...
:{{DIcon}} Guess it's become my business. Again.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 06a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, since it was swallowed up by a slime, maybe we can use [[Elemental Bait]] to lure all the nearby slimes to us.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 06a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You remember? The stuff we helped Master Diluc make.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And... Hehe, Paimon actually kept a small amount!
:{{DIcon}} Well done Paimon!
::{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 08a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's the very best partner, right?
:{{DIcon}} Don't tell me that when you get greedy, you...
::{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 08b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, don't sweat the small stuff.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Seems like you already have a plan.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup. We'll be back in a jiffy!

;(After cutscene ends)
:{{A|vo mnlq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Elemental Bait's really strong – it will attract all the slimes in the area.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even if they're just slimes, they can be dangerous together, so we'd best prepare ourselves.

; (Talking to Mona again)
:{{A|vo dialog mnlq001 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' This is your first mission, so don't mess it up.
:{{A|vo dialog mnlq001 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But if the going gets too tough for you... Well, I shall lend a hand then.

;(Talking to Mr. Zhu again)
:'''Mr. Zhu:''' Thank you all very much, that ring really is very important to me.
----
;(Upon finding the [[Nephrite Ring|ring]])
:{{A|vo mnlq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Found it! This must be the ring!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's so pretty. Paimon's sure it's worth a ton of...
:{{A|vo mnlq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Ah, Paimon wasn't having any bad thoughts! Let's bring the ring back to {{Color|buzzword|Mr. Zhu}}!
----
;(Giving the ring back to Mr. Zhu)
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mrzhu 01.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' That's it, that's the one! I thought it was lost forever!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' You actually found it. Not bad.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Mr. Zhu, you must take care of such precious things a bit better. You might not be so fortunate next time.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mrzhu 02.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' You're absolutely right. How would I have faced my family if I had lost the 253rd ring my mother gave me?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} ... ...
:{{DIcon}} ... ... ...
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mrzhu 03.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' Ah, let me explain. My family owns three jade mines, and in order to ensure that I would be able to find myself a good wife, my mother had many jade accessories made as heirlooms.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mrzhu 04.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' I think there might be over five hundred of them.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Then, why would you feel the need to set up an inn here?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mrzhu 05.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' Well, inheriting the family business too early unavoidably made things boring.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mrzhu 06.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' Thank you, all the same. Here's the Mora, as agreed. Please take it.
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then&mdash;
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' &mdash;Then I'll take it gladly!
:{{DIcon}} That was quick!
:{{DIcon}} Even Paimon wasn't that fast!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But we did all the work!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' A disciple should act like one. How can they steal their master's thunder?
:{{DIcon}} Well...
::{{A|vo mnlq001 8 paimon 03a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Traveler, didn't we say that we were just playing pretend?
:{{DIcon}} I never said I'd really be your disciple.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 8 paimon 03b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Well, you need to start practicing now. If my rival is as smart as I think they are, they will figure you out in a heartbeat.
:'''???:''' *stomach grumble*
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What was that rumbling sound?
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mrzhu 07.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' Oh, right, you mustn't have eaten in days. I'm very sorry, I forgot that you have no...
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Aaaaaaah&mdash;! Shhhhahahahaha! That didn't happen! Forget it!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...Hmph! Well, I suddenly feel that you have indeed contributed to our good fortune. I say we spend this money on treating you to a fine meal!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' If we travel north, we'll reach the {{Color|buzzword|Wangshu Inn}}. I hear that the food there is really good, so let's go try it out!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 mona 11.ogg}} '''Mona:''' No need to thank me, I'm just doing as a good master should!
:{{A|vo mnlq001 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did she say she was treating us?! Is Paimon hearing things?
:{{DIcon}} "Let's go after her." There. I said it for you.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 8 paimon 06a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go after her! For good food!
:{{DIcon}} "She's a good person." Said it for you.
::{{A|vo mnlq001 8 paimon 06b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's a good person! Hehe, let's have ourselves a great meal!

;(Talking to Mr. Zhu again)
:{{A|vo dialog mnlq001 mrzhu 01.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' Thank you all so much. You're welcome to drop by again.
:{{A|vo dialog mnlq001 mrzhu 02.ogg}} '''Mr. Zhu:''' Well, if this inn hasn't closed its doors yet, haha...
{{dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* One of the reasons why [[Darknight Hero's Alibi]] needs to be completed is due to the quest requiring ''Elemental Bait.''
* Unused voice-overs:
**{{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 06a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, since it was swallowed up by a slime, maybe we can use [[Elemental Bait]] to lure all the nearby slimes to us.
** {{A|vo mnlq001 4 paimon 06b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The formula is a secret, but it's really good at attracting slimes.
