;(When Wriothesley defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card wriothesley ingame easy 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Not bad.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card wriothesley invite easy 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Evidently, accepting your challenge despite being unprepared wasn't a particularly wise move...

;(If the player loses the match)

;(When the player defeats one of Wriothesley's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card wriothesley ingame hard 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Well played.

:{{A|vo card wriothesley ingame hard 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Still salvageable.

:{{A|vo card wriothesley invite hard 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' These cards aren't really working together, are they... I'll have to make some changes.

===Guest Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Wriothesley)
:{{A|vo card wriothesley freetalk 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I've seen some card game venues where they seal up the windows so no light can get in. That way, the customers lose track of time and never know when to stop. The boss of this place hasn't done that though. I guess they must be pretty confident in their business.

::{{A|vo card wriothesley leave 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Sure. I'll be leaving shortly too.

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card wriothesley endofgame win 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Looks like I came better prepared than you did. How did I prepare? Well, I read the rules, of course, then looked back on some of my previous duels... Why, what did you think I was going to say?

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card wriothesley endofgame fail 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' A textbook victory, assuming there was no cheating involved. Although to be fair, even if there were, it would still count... as long as you didn't get caught, that is.
