:'''Paimon:''' The Lantern Rite is here, bringing happiness, prosperity, and good fortune~
:'''Traveler:''' Paimon's back in festive mode, eh?
:'''Paimon:''' It's time to celebrate the festival! Not only does that mean meeting up with our friends, but there'll also be tons of great food and fun riddles, and we'll get to see [[Gaming]]'s Wushou Dance too...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's head over to [[Chenyu Vale]] together! Hehe, Paimon hasn't managed to try out every single type of dim sum they have yet!
:'''Paimon:''' We can ask Cloud Retai&mdash; Uhh, Paimon means [[Xianyun]] and the other adepti if they'd like to come too!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, and how could we forget about Gaming? Whether it's [[Qiaoying Village]] or [[Yilong Wharf]], no one here knows Chenyu Vale like he does!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Who else should we invite...
:'''Traveler:''' Why don't we take a stroll down to Liyue Harbor and ask some of our other friends too? The more companions, the merrier the Paimon, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Great minds think alike! We might even be able to get more people talking about Gaming's Wushou Dance while we're at it!
:'''Traveler:''' I'll head over to [[Xinyue Kiosk]] to grab some snacks for the road, then to [[Jiulue Teahouse]] for a couple of pots of the finest freshly-made tea.
:'''Traveler:''' Ready to set off?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go, let's go!

| '''Dancing Beasts to Meet the Spring Breeze'''
Beasts dance with vigor, auspicious to behold

In the legends of Chenyu Vale, Suanni are seen as a symbol of good fortune.<br>The well-known Wushou Dance in Chenyu Vale came from the movements of the Suanni.<br>It is a pity that, as times have changed, only a handful of people have actually ever seen such creatures in the flesh. But this performance art, which aims to bring good fortune into every household in the land, has nonetheless been passed down through the generations in Chenyu Vale.

| '''Jade Pendants and Vistas of Moonlit Hills'''
Remote landscapes extend, a new moon rises

People in Liyue love to eat, and their culinary traditions are extremely diverse. In Liyue Harbor, if you're looking for fancy Yue-style cuisine, then there's no better place than Xinyue Kiosk &mdash; and if it's highbrow Li-style cuisine that you're after, then Liuli Pavilion's the place to be. By the streetside, there's also the much-renowned Wanmin Restaurant, loved and praised by all.<br>But Chenyu Vale, famous for its tea, also has its own unique style of cuisine. There, you might sample pastries that contain egg yolk known as "Fine Tea, Full Moon," or perhaps try their delicious "Tea-Smoked Squab," which is made by marinating squab in tea.<br>Whatever you're looking for, Liyue's got it &mdash; whether it's sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, or any other flavor you could imagine.

| '''Wafting Aromas From Chenyu Vale'''
The fragrance of tea, and vistas of endless peaks

The people of Liyue love to drink tea.<br>As they travel through the vast land of Liyue, merchants will often stop for a bowl of Pop's Teas to cool off and quench their thirst.<br>Chenyu Vale, a place of majestic mountains and flowing waters, is also renowned for its elegantly decorated teahouses. If you're looking to enjoy a pot of tea, a selection of bite-sized nibbles, and leisurely chatter in the company of good friends, you've come to the right place.

| '''Wishing Aloft on Soaring Kites'''
Paper kites take flight, aspirations borne aloft

Where do all the paper kites and Xiao Lanterns released during the Lantern Rite fly off to, you might ask?<br>Perhaps they'll drift up to the top of some unknown peak in Jueyun Karst, or wind up getting caught in the leaves of a tea tree in Chenyu Vale.<br>But wherever they may end up, as these intricate creations float up into the clouds, the cherished wishes they carry &mdash; made with such care, and released with such hope &mdash; are borne skyward, to the firmament and beyond.

| '''Four Seasons and You'''
Little Paimon by your side, with you all the way

You and Paimon have discussed many things in your time, from the wings of a butterfly and the final destination of the falling stars, to the light that flashes through the clouds, the sounds of plants that sprout after the rain, and the ebb and flow of the tides.<br>And together with Paimon by your side, you've felt the spring breeze, been soaked by summer rains, gathered leaves in the fall, and warmed yourselves by winter fires.
