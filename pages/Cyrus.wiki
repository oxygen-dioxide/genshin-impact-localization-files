:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
;;(This option disappear after ???)
:;(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Cyrus:''' A crisis? I see this as the opportunity of a lifetime!
::'''Cyrus:''' If there is any adventurer who does not get their blood up at this, surely they fail as an adventurer!
::'''Cyrus:''' Once the time is right, I must take Jack and the others out to see the world. And thanks to this incident, our adventure teams can be expanded a little, yes?
::'''Cyrus:''' And as for the dragon... well, there isn't anything that cannot be conquered with perseverance, is there?

::'''Cyrus:''' I'm Cyrus, Master of the Adventurers' Guild, Mondstadt Branch!
::'''Cyrus:''' I'm sure we'll get to know each other later on. I can tell you are a born adventurer!
::'''Cyrus:''' How can I tell? Just call it a senior adventurer's hunch, haha!
::'''Cyrus:''' Listen, if you're interested, we can talk about it some more at Angel's Share another day!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Can you share some adventurer's experience with me?
::'''Cyrus:''' Why, of course. Here, take this. I'm sure it'll be of use to you.
::'''Cyrus:''' ...To put it plainly, you need only remember two words... Courage and perseverance!
:;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×7)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Adventurers' Guild.
::'''Cyrus:''' Ad astra abyssosque!
::'''Cyrus:''' We have branches all around Teyvat! Haha!
::'''Cyrus:''' You can meet fellow adventurers in the guild, participate in expeditions to every corner of the get paid for completing commissions...
::'''Cyrus:''' This truly is heaven for all adventurers! You sure you're not interested, kid? Hahaha...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Cyrus:''' A youngster like you should be more energetic. Don't be cold!

===Nighttime===
:'''Cyrus:''' Hey, isn't it.. you... You're here for the wine too?
;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
::'''Cyrus:''' What a showing from the Knights of Favonius! Most of them are youngsters without much combat experience, but they do have an adventurous spirit! Not bad. Not bad at all!
::'''Cyrus:''' If I had to criticize, then would say that they do drag their feet a little, perhaps?
::'''Cyrus:''' If it was always their intention to send me an adventure commission, they really didn't hive to take a whole day to decide that.
::'''Cyrus:''' Ah, I must be a little drunk.. Well, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that I'm treating tonight!
:{{DIcon}} You are... the Master of the Adventurers' Guild, right?
::'''Cyrus:''' Haha, you got a good memory.
::'''Cyrus:''' It's just a title, nothing more.
::'''Cyrus:''' I only became some legendary adventurer for completing some top-tier commissions by chance.
::'''Cyrus:''' The real legends... are for you to create! Hahaha...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your story.
:::'''Cyrus:''' My story? What is there to tell?
:::'''Cyrus:''' Let's see... I slew three, dragons, crushed two international pirate organizations; saved Teyvat once... Nothing major.
:::'''Cyrus:''' ...
:::'''Cyrus:''' ...Where was I? I think I'm getting a bit too tipsy...
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me then.

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Cyrus:''' Well then! It's the [[Windblume Festival]]. What do you say to going to [[Stormterror's Lair]] to search for clues regarding the Windblume?
:{{DIcon}} About the Windblume Festival...
::'''Cyrus:''' This is a day to remember those heroes who fought for their freedom. It is said that they once used Windblume as their code word...
::'''Cyrus:''' As to which flower the Windblume really is? Ah, there are as many views as there are people.
::'''Cyrus:''' To commemorate the courage and sacrifice of those heroes, we go out to search for clues regarding the Windblume each time the festival rolls back around.
::'''Cyrus:''' Over many years of searching, I have come to believe more and more that the Windblume is the [[Windwheel Aster]]!
::{{DIcon}} The Windwheel Aster?
:::'''Cyrus:''' Yes! Don't you think so, too?
:::'''Cyrus:''' Compared to the dandelion, the Windwheel Asters that turn the wind are the true symbol of Mondstadt's freedom and the soul of the Windblume Festival!
:::'''Cyrus:''' It's just that we lack concrete evidence with which to convince other people...
:{{DIcon}} So, about Stormterror's Lair...
::'''Cyrus:''' Ah, the Windblume Festival has its origins in Old Mondstadt and the days of the [[Decarabian|Lord of the Tower]]. Nowadays, no one knows what the Windblume truly is.
::'''Cyrus:''' And that is why we explore ancient ruins to uncover the history of resistance in those days. We wish to uncover the truth behind the Windblume.
::'''Cyrus:''' It is a shame that few young people agree with our views...
::'''Cyrus:''' If you ask me, the Windblume Festival should be about recounting the era of the Tower of Storms, and the legend of that heroic rebellion, haha!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:;(Dialogue responses are the same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Cyrus:''' A youngster like you should be more energetic. Don't be cold!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Of Ballads and Brews===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Cyrus:''' Hey, kiddo! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild!
:'''Cyrus:''' At the invitation of the [[Lisa|Librarian]], members of the Adventurers' Guild are expected to participate in [[Weinlesefest]] as well.
:'''Cyrus:''' Enjoy the wine, enjoy the adventure and help all those in need! This is the spirit of our adventurers, haha!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Windblume's Breath===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Cyrus:''' Oh, Traveler. As you can see, the Windblume Festival's come around again.
:'''Cyrus:''' Every festival, there are plenty of youngsters that like yo go out and adventure in the wilds.
:'''Cyrus:''' Ah, what can I say, I'm old. I know what these kids are thinking better than they do.
:'''Cyrus:''' To me, the Windblume Festival represents the continuation of the rebelliousness passed down by the resisting heroes from the era of the [[Decarabian|Stormlord of the Tower]].
:'''Cyrus:''' But... I suppose I can't expect the younger generation to think like me, right? Haha!
:'''Cyrus:''' Well, if the youngsters can feel the charm of adventuring through the spirit of the festival. I suppose it's worth it.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::;(Dialogue responses are the same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Adventurer's Guild.
::;(Dialogue responses are the same as normal)
