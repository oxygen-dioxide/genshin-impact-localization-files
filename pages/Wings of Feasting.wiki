==Lore==
This is an item that drifted here from another world. It symbolizes that world's final feast, and the coming of the weekend.

Once upon a time, that world was ruled by [[dragon]]s.<br>
But not the ones you hear about in stories. These were more akin to a {{w|dinosaur|cross between lizards and chickens}}.

It might be hard for you to imagine it, [[Klee]], but that was exactly what that world was like: fish-dragons lived in the oceans, and bird-dragons soared through the skies on wings that were super huge!<br>
They were powerful creatures, and so they looked down on all the other animals.<br>
In that world, they were rulers of all life.

Later on, humans appeared in that world.<br>
No one knows how that happened. Maybe they came with the falling meteorites. Who knows? But what we do know is that they had a strange habit, which was known as "Sunday dinner."<br>
Not long after, that day came. The feast was about to begin.<br>
Dragon drumsticks and dragon wings were smeared with flour, and were subjected to the flames of the furnaces that the humans made.<br>
They were made into food for everyone. They say that dragon meat tasted delicious, causes the people to lick their fingers after eating.<br>
The Sunday feast, which used to only happen once a week, became a daily occurrence, because the meat was just too good.<br>
"This is great!"<br>
"Let's have Sunday dinner every day of the week!"<br>
And so everyone cheered.<br>
And that was how the time of the dragons come to an end.

This wind glider commemorates that great extinction, and it was not always this color. It was once blue and white.<br>
[[Alice|Klee's mother]] changed its color scheme to be more amenable to that of their family, which resulted in its current form. She returned home briefly, leaving this wind glider behind, before leaving once again.<br>
"[[Teyvat]]'s [[False Sky|borders]] have grown fragile these past two years &mdash; looks like Mommy's going to have to get busy."
