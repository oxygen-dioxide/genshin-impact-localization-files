'''Stoking the Ancient Flames''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Ochkanatlan]], [[Natlan]].

==Steps==
# Activate all 5 of the [[Furnace of Fiery Embers|Furnaces of Fiery Embers]]
# Draw the ancient sword

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing Step 1 grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[Embers Rekindled (Achievement)|Embers Rekindled]]''.
* Completing Step 2 grants one copy of the [[Flute of Ezpitzal]].
* The ancient sword does not disappear after drawing it; the floating island may be re-visited by drawing the sword again.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Touch one of the [[Iridescent Inscription|Inscription]]s near the sword before activating the corresponding furnace)
:"The western/south-western/northern/eastern/south-eastern Furnace of Fiery Embers has not been activated yet"

;(Attempt to draw sword before activating all 5 furnaces)
:"Seemingly bound to the space itself, the old sword doesn't budge an inch..."

;(Touch one of the Inscriptions near the sword after activating the corresponding furnace)
:"The western/south-western/northern/eastern/south-eastern Furnace of Fiery Embers has been rekindled"
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* The small floating island that the player is teleported to after drawing the ancient sword is located directly above the [[Vision Serpent's Sanctum]], but it only spawns when teleporting by drawing the sword. A [[Portable Waypoint|portable teleport]] puts the player on thin air; likewise, it is not possible to land in the floating island when descending from the [[Tonatiuh]].
