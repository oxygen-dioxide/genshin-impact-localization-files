|text    = I do not feel much excitement for birthdays themselves. To me, it is as ordinary as the countless days that you and I have experienced. The sun rises and sets, the flowers bloom... Nothing more.

I can certainly see the reason why people value it. It is indeed a joy to gather and celebrate with important people on this special day.

If you have time, please come visit me. No need to rush, just come when you are free. And no need to bring any gifts, I will have the tea and snacks ready.

These ordinary days may turn into something different because of interesting people like you.
