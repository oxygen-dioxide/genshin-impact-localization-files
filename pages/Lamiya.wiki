:'''Lamiya:''' Data from two more users of the Inscribed Mirror. Hehe, if we get more good test data, then the product can be released soon...
:'''Lamiya:''' {{Traveler}}, what's the matter? Any questions about the experiment... er, the trial challenge?
:{{DIcon}} Since the Akasha is being used...
::'''Lamiya:''' Oh? You mean, "Why do we still use the Inscribed Mirror since we already are using Akasha technology," right?
::'''Lamiya:''' Considering the differences between animal and human brains, using the Akasha directly has a relatively high risk at this stage.
::'''Lamiya:''' Also, as only the sense of vision is connected, though you may see from the animal's perspective, it's still your own body moving...
::'''Lamiya:''' Consider what would happen if connected to the vision of a bird. Visually, you are flying, and it is hard to control a fear of heights or your instinctual movement. It would definitely cause accidents...
::'''Lamiya:''' Hehe, so the mirrors are better for the time being.
:{{DIcon}} How are Inscribed Mirrors used?
::'''Lamiya:''' First hold the mirror in your hand, and then touch it to activate the response.
::'''Lamiya:''' The mirror is showing the animal's perspective now.
::'''Lamiya:''' Of course, it has been edited. Many animals see the world very differently from us... but as it is made for people to use, we must tweak the image to be more acceptable.
::'''Lamiya:''' Hehe, Kshahrewar researchers wouldn't worry about that. How nice...
:{{DIcon}} No, no problems.
::'''Lamiya:''' Hehe, hope you make it through the trial challenge smoothly... No! For the sake of the test data, you MUST complete the trial challenge at all costs!
