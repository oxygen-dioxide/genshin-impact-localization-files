;(Enter Hotel Debord)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 01.ogg}} '''Argalia:''' There you are, Lynette! Where did you disappear to? Leone and I have been looking everywhere for you... Wait, where'd you get the cat?
: '''Bonnie:''' Meow~
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I found her outside. Do either of you happen to recognize her?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 leone 01.ogg}} '''Leone:''' Umm... I don't think so. Could belong to one of the guests, I suppose?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Eh, fair enough. It was a long shot...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 leone 02.ogg}} '''Leone:''' So sorry we couldn't help you, Lynette...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 02.ogg}} '''Argalia:''' Uh, don't worry! We'll... ask around for you! Leone's probably just being forgetful...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 leone 03.ogg}} '''Leone:''' Maybe you could leave her with us? We'll take her to the reception desk and see if they know anything. And if not... we'll just keep looking!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Sure. I would help, but I'm a little preoccupied. Sorry to dump this on you.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 03.ogg}} '''Argalia:''' It's no trouble at all! We're happy to help however we can!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 leone 04.ogg}} '''Leone:''' Also, uh... If it's no trouble, I mean &mdash; could we maybe get an autograph? ...And maybe a photo, too?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Uhh...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 04.ogg}} '''Argalia:''' Leone! You can't spring that on her now, not while she's working... At least wait until the event's finished!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 argalia 05.ogg}} '''Argalia:''' One last thing, Lynette &mdash; Director Merieux's looking for you... We'll take the cat to the front desk now. See you later!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} You're so popular!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Ugh, I'm not usually required at these kinds of events, so I don't even have an "event mode"... Alright, guess I'd better go see the director.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 corentin 01.ogg}} '''Corentin:''' ...Spectacular choreography, a masterpiece of mise-en-scene! And the performance &mdash; oh my, groundbreaking! Dripping with je ne sais quoi! ...My congratulations on another magnificent show, Sir.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 amaury 01.ogg}} '''Amaury:''' Yes, yes... I, for one, was particularly captivated by the clearly allegorical narrative undertones. The Lost Puppet shines a spotlight on the impact of technological advances in our modern society, particularly as they relate to changing modes of emotional expression and the challenge of mutual intelligibility!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 amaury 02.ogg}} '''Amaury:''' Such a pioneering work, so far ahead of its time... A tour de force of avant-garde theater!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 maloney 01.ogg}} '''Maloney:''' Hehehe, I can already see the headlines of tomorrow's newspapers! They will certainly be singing your praise, Director Merieux!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 01.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Hahaha... But it was a group effort, of course. To convey emotions in a silent show with no facial expressions, the entire cast had to go above and beyond. Everyone truly outdid themselves...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 01.ogg}} '''Friendly Reporter:''' Speaking of the cast &mdash; Gillian, another strong performance from you in Director Merieux's latest show, as of course we've all come to expect from your numerous successful collaborations to date...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 gillian 01.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' That's quite an overstatement. I've only ever played supporting roles...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 01.ogg}} '''Excited Reporter:''' On that point, you stated a few months ago in an interview that you were looking to secure a leading role in your next show. What led you to the decision to stay in a supporting role this time around?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 gillian 02.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 02.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Ahem... We had a discussion about this, and while Lynette hadn't previously performed in an acting role, we were blown away by her talent! And she was a perfect fit for this character...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 03.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Quite simply, this was the role she was born to play...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 gillian 03.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Exactly... I was honored to share the stage with her. Lynette worked extremely hard in all of the rehearsals, and she's an incredibly talented actress...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 02.ogg}} '''Friendly Reporter:''' ...Oh! Lynette's back!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 02.ogg}} '''Excited Reporter:''' Hey, Lynette, where've you been?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 03.ogg}} '''Friendly Reporter:''' Were you in "standby mode"? Some reports say you switch to that state to "recharge" after a show.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 corentin 02.ogg}} '''Corretin:''' Ah, method acting, of course! Such a compelling portrayal of a mechanical puppet could only be achieved by an actor who lives and breathes their role even while off stage!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 amaury 03.ogg}} '''Amaury:''' ...Those seemingly stilted movements were in fact an inspired portrayal of the character! The ostensible bad acting, in reality was the product of supreme acting skill!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Oh, uh... I went outside and there was this cat there, so... I played with the cat for a bit...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 corentin 03.ogg}} '''Corentin:''' A cat? ...Hahaha, we've long heard that you were a kind soul as well as an incredible actress. No wonder your debut performance has garnered such popularity!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 04.ogg}} '''Friendly Reporter:''' This show looks on track to break box office records for avant-garde theater. Lynette, any words for the fans?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Um, not really, no...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 amaury 04.ogg}} '''Amaury:''' Uh... I believe Lynette is trying to say that the act of performance itself is the actor's true means of connecting with their fans...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 05.ogg}} '''Friendly Reporter:''' Ohh, I see! Lynette, any comments?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Mm-hmm, right. Exactly.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 03.ogg}} '''Excited Reporter:''' ...But don't you want the fans to know how you're feeling right now? After the hugely successful opening of your first-ever show?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' That's true.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 04.ogg}} '''Excited Reporter:''' I'm sure the fans would love to learn a bit more about you, too!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 12.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...How interesting.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} [Insight] (Observe Lynette to see how she's doing...)
:;(If the card is less than 10)
:::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Lynette's answers all sound very calm. She seems fine...)
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 06.ogg}} '''Friendly Reporter:''' Lynette, how do you find acting compares with performing in a magic show?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 05.ogg}} '''Excited Reporter:''' What does the future hold for you, Lynette?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Uhh...
:::{{Black Screen|Lynette struggles to keep up as she is inundated with questions...<br>At long last, the crowd eventually disperses...}}
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 14.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' *sobs*...
:::{{DIcon}} Are you alright...?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 15.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Yeah, it's just... Turns out I can't cope with this stuff even in tea party mode...
:::{{DIcon}} Tea party mode...?
:;(If the card is greater than or equal to 10)
:::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Lynette's voice was so deadpan during the interview. She sounded like an auto-reply bot...)
:::{{DIcon}} Hold on. Lynette has only just finished performing. She needs to recharge.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 06.ogg}} '''Excited Reporter:''' Oh... Really? I'm so sorry, how rude of me...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereportera 07.ogg}} '''Friendly Reporter:''' Huh? Wait... You're the traveler who's been in the news! Did you come to see the show?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 mimereporterb 07.ogg}} '''Excited Reporter:''' Wow! Are you a fan of Lynette too? Do you have any comments on her first performance?
:::{{Black Screen|You and Lynette struggle to keep up as you're both inundated with questions...<br>At long last, the crowd eventually disperses...}}
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 16.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' *sobs*...
:::{{DIcon}} Are you alright...?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 17.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Yeah, it's just... Turns out even with you here to share the load, I can't cope with this stuff, even in tea party mode...
:::{{DIcon}} Tea party mode...?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 18.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It's a power-saving mode for participating in conversation at tea parties... Normally, I can get through an entire conversation just with "Mm-hmm," "Oh," "That's true," and "How interesting."
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 19.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...But at a tea party, I'm not normally subjected to a constant stream of questions. The energy consumption of that interview just now was three times as much as the average tea party...
:{{DIcon}} It's a big adjustment. Give it some time.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe after a few more interviews, you'll get used to it?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 20.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...I think I'd rather pray that I never have to do it again.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 cyril 01.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' Lynette &mdash; Director Merieux would like you to join the group photo to commemorate the successful opening of the show.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 21.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...A group photo?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 cyril 02.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' It's just the members of the troupe, along with Maloney and Corentin. Everyone's waiting for you.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 22.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Alright then... See you in a minute.
:{{Black Screen|Lynette and Cyril go to do the group photo...}}
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 cyril 03.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' Three, two, one, smile!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 04.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...My thanks to each and every one of you here for your help in making The Lost Puppet a success! The group photo is already being printed as I speak.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 merieux 05.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' You can collect your copy from the first floor after the drinks reception concludes. May it serve as a reminder of this fabulous performance every time you see it!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 maloney 02.ogg}} '''Maloney:''' Merieux! Hahaha, get over here and let's have another drink! There's a few things I need you to glance over for me...
:{{DIcon}} (Wait, that means... the reception STILL isn't over?)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918201 lynette 23.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I thought the group photo was the final hurdle... Well, at least there's no more people hounding me with questions. I just need to find somewhere to switch to standby mode, and the time will fly by... I hope.

;(Talk to Merieux, Maloney, Corentin, or Amaury, optional)
:'''Observe Crowd:''' (These people seem to be discussing the content of tomorrow's newspapers. Best not get too close...)

;(Approach [[Furina]])
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahh... Hotel Debord's [[Ile flottante]] is as wonderfully sweet as ever...
:{{DIcon}} Furina? You managed to get an invite to the drinks reception, too?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' {{Traveler}}? Lynette? ...Wait, hold on! What do you mean "managed to get an invite"? I'm an expert in the dramatic arts, of course I was invited!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Naturally, people wanted to hear my comments on the emerging art form that is the "masked mime show."
:{{DIcon}} So then, what did you think?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Remarkable. And a very worthwhile artistic endeavor, exploring a character with no lines or facial expressions, who can only communicate how they feel through their movement...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Your performance was beyond anything I could have imagined, Lynette. Clearly, this was a very suitable role for you indeed...
;(If Passive Check succeeds)
:;{{Color|Buzzword|(Perception Check Success)}} You seem to hear a sound...
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (If you listen closely, you can hear some small noise coming from the back corner...)
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm...? Is... Is something wrong...?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' No... it's nothing. Please, go on.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Basically, I think I'd give it a positive review overall, just not as gushing as the crowd downstairs.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...So you thought they were pretty over the top, too?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Mm... In fairness, it's normal to bring along some vocal supporters for publicity when a new show opens. But still, this was something else...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Then again, I'm no specialist in avant-garde theater. Maybe I'm just not well-acquainted with their review criteria.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Or maybe it's because I came to the show with some pre-conceived expectations? I did happen to see the original draft of Merieux's script a while back.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...What original draft?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, he didn't show it to you? It must have been a few months ago. He came to me to get some advice from an experienced performer's perspective... and then asked if I could write a few reviews of his new play.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I had a lot on my plate at the time, so I had to turn him down. I only skimmed a few sections, but they seemed quite different from the final version. I can't say I remember the plot, but...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I don't know, the protagonist just seemed more... complex, I guess? Especially in the last two scenes. Still a mechanical puppet on the outside, of course, but she seemed to have more emotional depth on the inside.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Emotional depth...?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, I'm just thinking aloud here, don't take it to heart. Besides, a script and a play are two very different beasts &mdash; there are so many fine details to consider when turning a story into a stage production. More than most people could imagine.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Especially with a novel art form like a masked mime show. I'm sure Merieux had his reasons for the changes he made.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Ahem! Change of topic &mdash; I see you've escaped the crowds to seek refuge on the second floor. Fame can be overwhelming at first, can't it? Perhaps you'd benefit from hearing about the experiences of a veteran celebrity such as myself?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' No thanks, I'm good. Pretty sure this'll be my first and last time in this situation...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, at least let me finish! I have top tips on dealing with belligerent reporters, slipping away to hunt down snacks during the intermission...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Tell me everything.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hahaha, first take a seat, mon amie! We must partake of Hotel Debord's fine desserts as we talk, lest they go to waste!
:{{Black Screen|The three of you enjoy some delectable treats...<br>As the reception comes to a close, Furina excuses herself and leaves...}}
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Mmm... That was very educational.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ("Educational" isn't the word I'd use... They didn't mention acting once in the whole conversation.)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918204 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I expect most of the people downstairs have left by now. Time to grab my copy of the group photo and get home.
{{Dialogue End}}

===A Cloud of Suspicion===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' The photo must be in this envelope right here. Ah, it's finally over... Thank you for sticking around for so long.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' If it wasn't for you, I don't know how I would've standby-moded my way through the last few hours...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Any normal person would find an event like this stressful... But enough to warrant Lynette leaving half way through?)
:{{DIcon}} When you left the event midway... What was the real reason?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...I mean, if you really don't want to talk about it...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...It's fine. It's just... it was such a minor thing.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' While I was on stage, there was a moment when I felt like someone was looking at me... It was only for an instant, and I didn't even see who it was. But somehow, I knew it was a look of contempt.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I got a vague sense of it again during the reception. Like someone was giving me an evil stare. But I couldn't figure out who it was...
;(If Passive Check succeeds)
:;{{Color|Buzzword|(Contemplation Check Success)}} You recall something regarding Lynette...
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Few people would manage to hide their feelings from Lynette at close range... Whoever it was, they must be a good actor.)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Normally, I'm used to lurking in the shadows on the stage and spying on other people. So it was strange, feeling like I was the one being spied on this time.
:{{DIcon}} Could it have something to do with the original script Furina mentioned?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe someone's jealous of you? You did land a leading role in your first show.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Or, someone just took a disliking to me for no real reason. Sometimes, you can like one person and dislike another for equally pointless reasons. Anyway, it was just a momentary stink-eye, that's all. Nothing for you to worry about.
:{{DIcon}} Okay... Well, if you're not worried, I'm not worried.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918202 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Okay, problem solved. I'm gonna take this envelope and go home now.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 08.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' A mechanical puppet with a bumbling body but a sensitive soul... "A stranger in time who doesn't belong..."

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 10.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...Ahem, alright then. Delving deep in the search of core truths is the job of an artist, after all...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 11.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' You shouldn't give your attention to early drafts of the script, Lynette. All it would do is sow confusion where you already have clarity.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 12.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' The current script is the final version because it is the best version, and your performance best brings that script to life. Why, if it weren't for you, I doubt any audience would give our show the time of day!

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 20.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Definitely. Those lowlifes... Slander and libel are all their specialties. They drown out the truth with a flood of misinformation, and they stop at nothing once they get riled up!
:{{DIcon}} You sound very familiar with their methods.
:{{DIcon}} Do you have a particular suspect in mind?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918203 merieux 21.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...There's so many of them out there. Fame always seems to attract haters, no matter what you do to try and keep everyone happy. But don't worry! I will get to the bottom of this!

:{{DIcon}} Do you think that's it?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...I kinda doubt it. We've dealt with those types before. Usually their goal is to steal our venue for their own show, or to cover up a scandal by planting a story to divert public attention.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918203 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' But at the moment... I don't think anyone's got a reason to do any of that stuff. Let alone pull a stunt like this &mdash; a threat letter is quite extreme.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918205 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' By "wasn't bad"... You mean it wasn't great either. So I'm guessing Merieux changed the script to simplify the protagonist... Make her a dumbed-down version of the mechanical puppet that I could actually play.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Yep, that's not something a novice could hope to pull off after just a few months of rehearsals.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The basic plot is the same &mdash; she loses the ability to dance due to wear-and-tear in her circuitry. But there's much more emotion behind the scene... the memory of her former companions, coming to peace with her life...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The simple set and solo performance means the lead actress has to carry the whole scene herself. It's a much more demanding role than in the final script.)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Frankly, I think that the original script is much better, and the original lead is the best fit.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Gillian, shall I go tell Merieux to put you back in the leading role?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 01.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' ...!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 01.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' ...What? Are you serious? But the next show is at the Opera Epiclese! It's such a huge opportunity...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...But not such a rare one for me though, right?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 02.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' That's different! This isn't you as part of a magic duo, it's a chance to star as the main character in a show! You'll reach whole new heights of fame!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Umm... Fame in small doses has its perks, but... too much, and I'll get overloaded.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' But if you play the lead, the fame will be yours, and I get to be free... Sounds like a win-win, don't you think?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 02.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' ...It'll never work. There's no way Director Merieux or Maloney would ever agree to it.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 03.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' The set for act four would need to change, as would all the marketing materials... and that would mean asking Maloney for a lot more Mora.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 04.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Changing actors at the last minute is just too risky. If anything went wrong, it could bankrupt the whole troupe!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 05.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Plus, Maloney's "friends" have already published a ton of articles saying how this is the role that Lynette was born to play... No one else can play the protagonist now.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 06.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' If Lynette quit the show and I took her place...
:{{DIcon}} ...It would destroy the reputations of Maloney's "friends."
:{{DIcon}} ...None of their future articles would have any credibility.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 07.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' ...If Lynette left, they'd sooner stop the whole show then let me take her place.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 jacques 03.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' Stop the whole show!? But... All the people in the troupe... months and months of everyone's hard work would all be for nothing!
:{{DIcon}} No wonder Merieux will say anything to try and keep Lynette on board.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Gillian, you said before: "Whatever disappointment I had left... I wasn't about to take out on you."

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 12.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Wait, but what about the threat letter? Do you have any idea who sent it?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 18.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' As long as we stick to the plan, I'll give up the lead role... so it won't matter anymore, right?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 gillian 13.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' But surely you want to know who it's from? If they're out there and no one's keeping an eye on them... What if they come looking for you?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 19.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Umm... I doubt they will. It's supposed to be a threat, but they didn't even say what would happen if I don't meet their demands... Plus the handwriting is kinda childish. Doesn't look like a professional intimidator to me.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 20.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Who knows, maybe it was just a fan of yours having a moment.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 29.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' She idolizes Gillian, both as an older sister and an actress... and she watched as the dream role Gillian had been waiting to play for so long got snatched away from her by some amateur who's never acted before.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 30.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' To make matters worse, all the critics were hailing this amateur as a perfect fit for the role, and even Fontaine's former biggest star was praising her abilities...
:{{DIcon}} It was too much for her to take...
:{{DIcon}} She wrote that letter in a fit of anger.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 31.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Yeah. That pretty much sums it up.
:{{DIcon}} Aren't you gonna confront her about it?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 32.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Like I said, getting angry at angsty teenagers is draining. Besides...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 33.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' If it was my younger brother or sister, and they found out I'd been treated unfairly or had an opportunity stolen from me... They'd definitely do something far worse.
:{{DIcon}} I can imagine...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 34.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I was in Gillian's position once. Back when Lyney and I were starting out, before we got famous, we just had to take things a day at a time &mdash; doing our shows, slowly trying to build up our reputation...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 35.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' So I can understand Ginna's frustration. Still... she could definitely use some pro tips on how to write a threat letter.
:{{DIcon}} No wonder she's so hostile towards you...
:{{DIcon}} She must have been the one giving you that evil stare, right?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 36.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...No, the way she looks at me is indignant, frustrated, but not malicious. Plus, she didn't even try to hide how she felt.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 37.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Whoever was giving me that evil stare was backstage. Blending into the crowd at a drinks reception is one thing, but trying to blend in backstage, where everyone's on high alert waiting to be called on stage, would be a lot more difficult.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 38.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' We'll find out who it is before too long. In two days' time, at the next show... I think it will become very clear.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918207 lynette 39.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' On that note &mdash; guess I'll see you at the opera house. Bye for now.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' If they'd seen me in the leading role during the first half, they wouldn't be expecting anything more... But what happens now that they've seen Gillian in the role?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' If you force me to play the lead in the second half, they'll be wondering: Why is the actress suddenly giving such an underwhelming performance, right at the climax of the whole story?
:{{DIcon}} Is it because she's not a good enough actress to play the role?
:{{DIcon}} Or is this director not all he's cracked up to be?
:{{DIcon}} Were the critics wrong?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' These are just some of the questions that will be on everyone's minds during the second half. And those questions will follow them out the doors of the theater after the show ends.
:{{DIcon}} Do you think the critics will still have any credibility then?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' There's only one way for you to save your reputation. And that's to keep Gillian as the lead all the way to the end.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 05.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Absolutely not! I'd sooner announce that we're having technical difficulties and need to stop the show!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 06.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' If I keep Gillian as the lead for the second half, what do you think will happen in the curtain call, when she takes her mask off? Everyone will see that we've changed actors!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 07.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' What will your fans think? They're only here because of you! And what about all the critics who support you? If we get on the wrong side of them, it'll be the death of the whole show!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 08.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' There'd be tickets to refund, fines to pay for breach of contract... The whole troupe's hard work would go down the drain! Don't you see how much this would cost us?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 09.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...You can't just take a job on a whim, then abandon your responsibility the moment you don't feel like doing it anymore! You're playing games with other people's hopes and dreams!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 02.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Director Merieux, please! You're not being fair to Lynette...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Actually, Gillian, he's half right. I did kind of take this on a whim.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' But my responsibility here is making sure you get back the role that belongs to you.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Heh, and I guess part of that responsibility lies with me, considering I badgered you into accepting the job?
:{{DIcon}} Look who finally decided to show up.
:{{DIcon}} Did you bring all your props?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, sorry I'm a little late to the show. Work's been keeping me pretty busy lately.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 10.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Lyney...? Ugh, what do you want? Do you think you can snap your fingers and make all my problems magically disappear?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That might be a little tricky... But instead, I could make something else magically appear.
:[[File:Mask Lyney's Letter.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 11.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...What's this?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' A draft complaint letter, my contract, your legal fees, reimbursement for the tickets, and an advance on the penalty fee for breach of contract.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Mr. Merieux... I'm stepping down from the leading role. Regardless of whether you choose to cancel the rest of today's show.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If you do suffer unforeseen financial losses from this, you're free to seek damages as per the contract. And if you want to file a lawsuit, there's a draft here that you can use if you need it.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 12.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' What the... Hah... I can't believe this. You're literally handing me a lawsuit against you, with a straight face?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 13.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Of course... All this Mora, it's a pittance to you, isn't it? Hmph, must be nice to have the luxury of prior success and fame!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 14.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Look at us, we're huge stars! One minute we wanna go on stage, the next we feel like backing out of the contract. But that's okay, we're famous, we can afford it! You have no respect for other people's work! You're treating other people's hopes and dreams like a big joke!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 15.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...You don't give a hoot how much this show means to other people. You don't even care that the whole production might have to shut down because of you!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 12.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...That's not true. I do care. And I'm under no illusion as to how much this show means to you.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 16.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...Oh, brilliant deduction there. Of course it means a lot to me, this is my show! That's the only reason I asked you to be in it in the first place!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Really? Then why do your eyes tell a different story? The way you look at me... it's full of contempt.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 14.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Almost as if... I've destroyed your work of art.
:{{DIcon}} (Ah... so it was Merieux.)
:{{DIcon}} (He's the one who was looking at Lynette with contempt.)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 17.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' What? I... I would never think that!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' A couple days ago, I asked some associates to do some digging for me. I was interested to know who else you invited to play the lead apart from Lynette...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Surprise, surprise &mdash; turns out that all the other famous actresses you asked either had prior commitments or weren't a good fit for the role... they all turned you down.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 15.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...And I would have turned you down too, if not for an unlikely set of coincidences.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You didn't send those invitations because you were looking for a better actress than Gillian... but because your investor wanted a big name in your show. Right?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 03.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Director Merieux...
:{{DIcon}} It's clear as day that Gillian is an outstanding actress.
:{{DIcon}} But fame was the key factor, and that was the one thing she didn't have.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 16.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' To get Maloney on your side, you chose to make Gillian the understudy and then look for an opportunity for her to take the lead.
:{{DIcon}} But then... Lynette actually accepted your invitation.
:{{DIcon}} And her acting debut was sure to attract attention.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I bet you were torn at first, weren't you? Do you stick to the tried-and-tested formula? Choose Lynette, use her celebrity to get the critics on your side so that you and your investors can line your pockets?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 17.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Or... do you choose Gillian, so that you and your long-time collaborator can stage the show of your dreams: the original, unedited version of The Lost Puppet?
:{{DIcon}} Whether you did it because of pressure from your investors...
::{{DIcon}} Ultimately, you betrayed yourself by choosing Lynette.
:{{DIcon}} Or because you were lured in by the money...
::{{DIcon}} Ultimately, you betrayed yourself by choosing Lynette.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 18.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Agh...! I&mdash;I didn't... I didn't betray myself...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 18.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You mentioned "prior success and fame" earlier... But you're a well-known director yourself, with countless works to your name. Wouldn't that make you successful too?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 19.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Or maybe, deep down... none of your current achievements really count as "success" to you.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 19.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Argh...!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Right now, you have an opportunity to send Gillian onto that stage and perform the second half as you always imagined it, faithful to your original script.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Your work would be displayed for all of Fontaine to see, in its true, perfect form.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 20.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Did... did you say... perfect...?
:{{DIcon}} Will you keep pursuing a kind of "success" that you don't even value...
:{{DIcon}} ...At the cost of your own artistic integrity?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 20.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Or... will you act now, before Maloney and the critics can protest, and make your dream come true on the stage? And Gillian's dream... in fact, the dreams of the whole troupe.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 21.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...The whole troupe?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 04.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Director Merieux... Actually, most of the money Lyney brought came from us. We all chipped in.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 cyril 03.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' We've worked with you for many years now. Your troupe has been here for you all the way, from the empty theaters where we first performed to the opera house today.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 jacques 02.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' We watched as you slowly started down a path you used to despise... the path of powerful connections, drinks receptions, backdoor deals with the critics, and collaborations based on fame instead of talent.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 22.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' But... But this is just a temporary measure! I did it for the good of the troupe! And... and besides, this is how the whole industry works! Everyone else is doing it!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 cyril 04.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' Yes, we know. Back when you started, you had to bite the bullet and do these things to keep the troupe afloat.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 cyril 05.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' But then what happened? You began to embrace these methods more and more, becoming so reliant on them that every show you put out is over-hyped by the media, and every script you write is edited to suit some celebrity's needs.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 jacques 03.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' Surely you must have noticed what's happening? While we've been performing at bigger and bigger theaters with each show, the applause is getting quieter and quieter each night, and the criticism from people who've seen the show is growing.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 jacques 04.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' Maloney's "friends" are sycophants. They don't care if the audience is disappointed because the show doesn't live up to their glowing reviews. They praise the things they like, and skirt around the things they don't!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 05.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Look, I know everyone's using the same promotional tactics, but... does that really make it okay?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 merieux 23.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Well, it's... it's just a stop-gap solution. I... as soon as I've made enough Mora, I'll stop. Things will be different next time, I promise...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lynette 21.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Next time, huh? Yeah, next time you won't use your connections, next time you won't pay off your critics. Next time, you'll let Gillian play the lead...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. If you make some money once, you'll want to do it again, then again... Slowly but surely, you turn your back on your dreams.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 gillian 06.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' ...I won't turn my back on my dreams any longer, Director Merieux! Never again!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918211 together 01.ogg}} '''Jaiques & Cyril:''' Me neither!

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 03.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...What's worrying me now isn't how Maloney will react, or whether the show will get canceled.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 04.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' It's... the audience. I've always thought the original script is better, but will it move them like I've always hoped? When Gillian does her curtain call, will they applaud her?

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Director Merieux, Mr. Maloney, what on earth is going on? Why was Lynette not in the lead role?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It took a lot of convincing from me for her to accept the role, and I had to turn down some big work opportunities to come and watch her performance today... You have some explaining to do.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Lyney, as a matter of fact... this was a piece of performance art.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...In this play, the masks and costumes serve to obscure the differences between characters, and by extension, the difference between human and machine...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' We took that idea to the next level with an actor swap, blurring the lines between one performer and the next. So it's in service of the ambitious artistic goals of the production.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It's similar to deceiving the audience in a magic show. We employed this technique as a means of breaking the fourth wall.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It allows the audience to more intuitively understand the cognitive dissonance felt by the protagonist as a machine trying to reconcile the notion of her humanity.

:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Oh, I see! Well, bravo Director Merieux. You even had me fooled!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' That's probably more because you just don't really understand avant-garde art very well, Lyney.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Maybe so, maybe so... Well, perhaps it went over my head, but I'm sure our experts here saw the whole thing coming a mile away!

:{{DIcon}} I'm sure that will help Director Merieux by setting future audiences up for the surprise twist at the end.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 amaury 03.ogg}} '''Amaury:''' Ahem! Y&mdash;Yes, you're right. Director Merieux and I are old friends... You should have said something, then I could have played along even better...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 merieux 13.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Ahem, yes, well... To deceive the audience, you must first deceive your closest companions... I have to give credit to Lynette and her experience in performing magic &mdash; that's what inspired me to take my art to the next level...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm? You mean your show was partly inspired by Lynette's background in magic? Well, in that case, I'll have to plug it to everyone I know!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Unfortunately, I think Mr. Maloney is going to cancel the show.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Cancel the show? Mr. Maloney, is this true!?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 maloney 04.ogg}} '''Maloney:''' Uhh... While I accept that deceiving the audience in the manner you did certainly has artistic merit... This is not a magic show, and we don't want our audience demanding their money back...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 12.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...A very valid criticism, and one that I humbly accept. If that happens, we're prepared to reimburse and apologize to any audience members who weren't satisfied with the experience.
:{{DIcon}} But based on their reaction today, I think that what most people want to see...
:{{DIcon}} ...Is an excellent piece of theater, and not celebrity cameos.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Plus, it looks like Gillian is better than me at delivering the excellence people want to see. I'm sure audiences will be very happy with the show if she's allowed to stay in the leading role.
:{{DIcon}} Some reviews have said that Lynette gave the performance of the year...
:{{DIcon}} Wouldn't you say Gillian's was the performance of a lifetime?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 corentin 03.ogg}} '''Corentin:''' Maloney, uh... I believe there should still be time to tweak my article? From the look on Lynette's face... I think she's being sincere...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 14.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Oh, one other thing... We managed to get a meeting with Lady Furina earlier &mdash; all thanks to {{Traveler}}'s reputation, of course.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 15.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Anyway, she agreed to write a review focusing on Gillian's performance and the quality of the show as a whole... She promised to give her honest opinion.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 16.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...And I'm sure today's audience will be discussing her performance too. There's sure to be a variety of opinions.
:{{DIcon}} But what about you, Mr. Corentin?
:{{DIcon}} How would you rate this show?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 corentin 04.ogg}} '''Corentin:''' Oh... I mean... art at its finest, clearly! Um, but I'll have to give it some thought before I decide exactly what to write...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 lynette 17.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Oh, of course. Always good to put some thought into these things. Especially now, with a growing range of voices out there... I imagine competition for readers becomes more fierce when everyone's discussing the topic?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 maloney 05.ogg}} '''Maloney:''' Tsk... Corentin! Amaury! Let's go!

===That's All, Folks===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Jaiques and Cyril, optional)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 jacques 03.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' ...Do you think this move needs jazzing up a little?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 cyril 02.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' Not jazzing up, per se. I was thinking more, like... break it down, you know?

;(Talk to Gillian and Ginna, optional)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 gillian 05.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Ginna? ...You snuck in? When? ...I thought I told you, no visiting me at work...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918212 ginna 01.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' I'm sorry, Gillian... But I had to come...

;(Approach Lynette and Merieux)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 01.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Thank you both so much. Without the two of you, who knows how much further down that cynical path I would have gone...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 02.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' I always told myself that once I'd made enough Mora, I'd get back to doing what I loved... But somewhere along the way, I started to lose sight of what that was.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 03.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Huh... Just like those critics with their dishonest reviews, I became all about the trappings of success, at the expense of the art itself.
:{{DIcon}} At least you came to your senses just in time.
:{{DIcon}} And you've got an amazing group of talented people behind you.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 04.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...You're right. Yes, I'm a very lucky man.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 05.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...Anyway, enough about my problems &mdash; what are we going to do about the threat letter that Lynette received?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 06.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' I've been looking into it a lot over the past couple of days, but it doesn't seem like it was one of our competitors after all...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Ah yes, about that...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 01.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' Um... Lynette, do you... have a moment?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 07.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Hmm? Wait, you're... Gillian's sister, right?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 01.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' I'm sorry, Ginna insisted on coming to see Lynette, I couldn't stop her...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 02.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' Lynette... I'm sorry!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Ah...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Lynette just shot me a glance... I think she's unsure which "mode" to use in this situation...)
:{{Hangout Branch|(Wait and see how things play out.)|Break}}
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 05.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' That letter... I was the one who wrote it.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 11.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...What!?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 03.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Ginna... So it was YOU!
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 05.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' Director! It's time for... Ooh, okay, weird energy here...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 cyril 03.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' I think we came at a bad time...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 04.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Lynette, I... Ginna must have been worried sick about me, I'm sure even she wouldn't do something so stupid if she was in her right mind... Oh, I'm so sorry! I promise I'll make it up to you somehow!
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 06.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' ...Gillian, no! This is completely my fault, and I'm the one who should have to bear the consequences! I got the wrong end of the stick, and completely misjudged Lynette...
::{{DIcon}} Shall we hear what Lynette has to say?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Well... Since I haven't actually suffered any losses, seeking redress could be difficult...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Maybe we could just... let this one slide?
:: {{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 05.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' Really? ...Are you sure?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 12.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' After all, Ginna wouldn't be the first person to ever misjudge me... Right?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 12.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Uhh... True, true...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' In any case, I think we can all agree it was a misunderstanding and nothing more. No need to overcomplicate things.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 07.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' But still... I was wrong to write that letter. I should own up to my actions &mdash; make it up to you in some way...
::{{DIcon}} She seems pretty insistent...
::{{DIcon}} Kids at this age really are stubborn...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 14.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Hmm... If that's what you really want, then how about helping out backstage?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 08.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' Huh? Backstage...?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 15.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' The crew could always use an extra hand. Plus... it'll give your older sister a chance to keep an eye on you. And stop you getting into any more trouble.
:: {{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 06.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' ...Thank you, Lynette... Really. Thank you so much.

::;(Draw a card equal to 6 or greater)
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Yeah, me neither.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 03.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' Wait... but...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Oh, do you mean when we ran into you at the Fleuve Cendre? And you said some mean things to me?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' As I recall, you were only trying to look out for your sister. It was just a few words spoken in anger. Don't worry, whatever it was you said, I've already forgotten.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 08.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 09.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' ...Hah. I see.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 merieux 10.ogg}} '''Merieux:''' Well, it sounds like Ginna knows what she did was wrong. Owning up to your mistakes and committing to do better in the future is what counts.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I understand that feeling of wanting to stand up for your family when they're being mistreated. Really, I do.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...But next time, maybe consider a different tactic? Something you can pull off more effectively, and without arousing suspicion...
::{{DIcon}} Alright, that's enough...
::{{DIcon}} Stop giving her ideas!
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 ginna 04.ogg}} '''Ginna:''' Got it... Thank you, Lynette.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 gillian 02.ogg}} '''Gillian:''' ...Why do I feel like I'm missing something here?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 01.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' Hey, here you are! I was wondering where you'd all run off to.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 cyril 01.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' Great, everyone's in one place. That makes this so much easier.
::{{DIcon}} What's up?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 02.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' Hehe, what do you think? It's group photo time! We have to commemorate the debut of The Lost Puppet: Director's Edition!
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 03.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' Okay everyone, we all have pretty awkward smiles on our faces in the photo from Hotel Debord. So this time, no forced smiles allowed!
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Ohh... Am I really not allowed to force a smile...
::{{DIcon}} Is smiling tough for you?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...I'll try, I suppose. I think I can manage.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 jacques 04.ogg}} '''Jaiques:''' Lynette, {{Traveler}}, come on &mdash; you two should be right in the middle...
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918213 cyril 02.ogg}} '''Cyril:''' Three, two, one, smile!
