===Tutorial===
[[File:Tutorial Wishful Drops 1.png|200px|thumb|left]] If you equip Inquisitive Endora from your Inventory, you can summon her when in an exploration area. However, if you are not in an exploration area, Inquisitive Endora will not answer your summons.

[[File:Tutorial Wishful Drops 2.png|200px|thumb|left]] At this time, the player's Elemental Skill will be replaced with Endora's Bubble Spit ability.
{{Clr|L}}
[[File:Tutorial Wishful Drops 3.png|200px|thumb|left]] Bubble Spit can be used to restrain opponents. {{Color|help|Defeating Oceanid Creatures by other means will not increase exploration progress.}} Endora can only absorb Oceanid Creatures after restraining them with Bubble Spit. When this happens, area exploration progress will increase accordingly. Once exploration is complete, you will receive a reward for the current area.
