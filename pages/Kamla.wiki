==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kamla:''' A look at the sea puts the mind at ease.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Kamla:''' Hello, friend. Well, isn't the sea beautiful?
::'''Kamla:''' Do not rush your pace. Slow down and appreciate the beauty in life.
::'''Kamla:''' I've been watching the waves crashing since my husband sailed out.
::'''Kamla:''' Well, except during storms, of course.
::{{DIcon}} About your husband...
::'''Kamla:''' Oh, that bastard... Well... honestly, I don't know where he's sailing right now.
::'''Kamla:''' Judging by what he'd sent home, he should be safe and well, and he's been to a lot of places.
::'''Kamla:''' I've got clocks from Fontaine, porcelain bowls from Liyue, dried petals from Mondstadt...
::'''Kamla:''' I didn't know he could be romantic.
::'''Kamla:''' But things like these can only be placed indoors. I prefer the fresh air and sea waves outside.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kamla:''' Goodbye. Enjoy the sea wind.
