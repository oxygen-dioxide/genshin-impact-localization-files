'''Bunny Triggered''' is [[Amber]]'s Level 2 [[Constellation]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Baron Bunny manual detonation:
** Only [[Amber]] with this Constellation can manually detonate Baron Bunny; other archers cannot.
*** In Co-Op Mode, this Constellation enables the player to detonate other players' Baron Bunnies, even if they have not unlocked this Constellation.
** The foot's hitbox is extended to the narrow nearby ground, allowing for easier detonation. However, the hitbox is not extended upward, so hitting the upper half of Baron Bunny does not manually detonate.
*** Shallow [[water]] can cover up Baron Bunny's foot and nearby ground, preventing manual detonation.
** The second arrow from [[One Arrow to Rule Them All]] cannot trigger detonation.
** [[Transformative Reactions]] triggered by Amber's Aimed Shots that hit Baron Bunny's foot can detonate Baron Bunny, including [[Overloaded]] and [[Burgeon]].
*** This makes detonating multiple Baron Bunnies (with [[It's Not Just Any Doll...]] or [[Co-Op Mode]]) within one shot possible.
* The "200% additional DMG" is [[DMG Bonus]].
