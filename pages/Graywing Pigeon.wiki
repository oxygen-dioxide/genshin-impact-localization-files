|description = A common avian species in Teyvat. Plump and meaty, but can also be trained to deliver messages.<br>An ordinary pigeon that takes its name from its gray feathers. This pigeon's feathers become gradually greener along the neck, but unfortunately it is such a common sight that its gorgeous plumage is now taken entirely for granted by most people.
