<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Zhuyu was once a sailor who spent most of his time at sea. After his wife, [[Qinglian]], fell ill, he decided to quit his job and become an herb gatherer to spend time with her and fetch her medicine. He is unaware that she's actually faking her illness so he would stay by her side.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Zhuyu:''' If there were a medicine in this world that could cure all diseases, I would do whatever it took...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Zhuyu:''' My wife has a weak constitution, so she's always getting sick. This time, though, the illness got very serious. She still hasn't fully recovered.
::'''Zhuyu:''' As a sailor, I blame myself for spending all my time out at sea and not being here to take better care of her over the years...
::'''Zhuyu:''' Now, I've decided to leave the ocean behind and pick medicine for her up in the mountains. I want to do everything I can for her. Even if just to ease things for her a little.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You seem quite tired.
:::'''Zhuyu:''' I'm alright. Picking herbs in the mountains can be quite exhausting. Fortunately, my wife has prepared some berries for me.
:::'''Zhuyu:''' This sweet taste really has the ability to relieve exhaustion.
:::'''Zhuyu:''' Still, I can't finish them all. Since you've still got a long road ahead of you, why don't you take some? Don't be shy now.
::;(Obtain [[Berry]] ×6)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Zhuyu:''' Goodbye. Safe travels.
