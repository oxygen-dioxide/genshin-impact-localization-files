==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Reza:''' There's only so much I can do sometimes...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Reza:''' Hello, I'm the Port Master of Port Ormos, in charge of tax levies, customs, etc.
::'''Reza:''' Come see me or my chief secretary for any questions regarding trade.
::'''Reza:''' And make sure to report any violations. Everyone will thank you for it... except the offenders.
::{{DIcon}} Violations...
::'''Reza:''' Port Ormos is the key trade hub in Sumeru, so the most common offense is smuggling.
::'''Reza:''' Anyone seen sneaking around with suspicious cargo is likely a smuggler.
::'''Reza:''' For your financial security, please do not give in to greed and refrain from dealings with suspicious individuals.
::'''Reza:''' Also, occasionally &mdash; and I mean occasionally &mdash; there would be fugitives trying to escape from here.
::'''Reza:''' If you run across them, don't try to stop them and just flag down one of the Eremites patrolling nearby for help.
:{{DIcon}} Need help?
::'''Reza:''' Thanks for asking, but some of the problems go a long way back and can't be easily changed.
::'''Reza:''' According to new Sumeru regulations, foreign trading is limited to Port Ormos, but a lot of people have been doing business in the city for a long time...
::'''Reza:''' It's just too hard to dissuade them from the old way of trading.
::'''Reza:''' So it's not that we don't want to solve certain issues, but that we just don't know how.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Reza:''' Farewell and safe journeys.

==Event Dialogue==
===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Reza:''' Hello. I'm the Port Master of Port Ormos. Come see me or my chief secretary for any questions regarding trade.
:'''Reza:''' The Dendro Archon's birthday sure has brought in whole fleets of new ships from abroad! Sure, we're really happy trade is flourishing, but it's also fertile ground for new problems to crop up...
:'''Reza:''' *Sigh* I shouldn't jinx things like that. After all, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?
:'''Reza:''' Speaking with the foreign merchants is most interesting, too. I've learned quite a lot.
