==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Reza:''' There's only so much I can do sometimes...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Reza:''' Hello, I'm the Port Master of Port Ormos, in charge of tax levies, customs, etc.
::'''Reza:''' Come see me or my chief secretary for any questions regarding trade.
::'''Reza:''' And make sure to report any violations. Everyone will thank you for it... except the offenders.
::{{DIcon}} Violations...
::'''Reza:''' Port Ormos is the key trade hub in Sumeru, so the most common offense is smuggling.
::'''Reza:''' Anyone seen sneaking around with suspicious cargo is likely a smuggler.
::'''Reza:''' For your financial security, please do not give in to greed and refrain from dealings with suspicious individuals.
::'''Reza:''' Also, occasionally &mdash; and I mean occasionally &mdash; there would be fugitives trying to escape from here.
::'''Reza:''' If you run across them, don't try to stop them and just flag down one of the Eremites patrolling nearby for help.
:{{DIcon}} Need help?
::'''Reza:''' Thanks for asking, but some of the problems go a long way back and can't be easily changed.
::'''Reza:''' According to new Sumeru regulations, foreign trading is limited to Port Ormos, but a lot of people have been doing business in the city for a long time...
::'''Reza:''' It's just too hard to dissuade them from the old way of trading.
::'''Reza:''' So it's not that we don't want to solve certain issues, but that we just don't know how.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Reza:''' Farewell and safe journeys.
