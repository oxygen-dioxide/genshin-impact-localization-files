:'''Lisette:''' Where should I adventure next?
:{{DIcon}} Adventure, you say?
::'''Lisette:''' That's right. My adventure here's been awesome! Everyone treats me well, especially the people at the Spina di Rosula.
::{{DIcon}} You're not from around here originally?
::'''Lisette:''' Um, I... don't really remember.
::'''Lisette:''' One day, when I woke up, I was... just here. Maybe Mom and Dad abandoned me, or something...
::{{DIcon}} That wasn't your fault.
::'''Lisette:''' I know. Everyone here tells me that too.
::'''Lisette:''' Everyone here is super friendly, and I'm living really well. Even if I don't go back... I mean, I'd be totally okay staying here forever!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
:'''Lisette:''' Yup, seeya!
