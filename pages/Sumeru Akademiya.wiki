The '''Sumeru Akademiya''' is [[Sumeru]]'s main governing body, as well as the most prestigious institute in all of [[Teyvat]], located in the middle of the tree trunk of [[Sumeru City]]. It is particularly renowned for its corpus in arcane arts and historical records.

==Overview==
The Akademiya accepts students from all over Teyvat and often sends traveling scholars, known as Driyosh, to other nations to gather material for research. It is unknown how long the Akademiya has existed, but it was already a prestigious institute by the time of the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago.<ref name="WET">{{Ref/Arti|Witch's End Time}}</ref> The Akademiya also takes a role as a governing body of Sumeru handling much of the day-to-day affairs of Sumeru.

===Virtues and Sins===
The Akademiya has three virtues and six sins. The virtues are described in Sumeru's [[Talent Level-Up Material#Sumeru|Talent Level-Up Books]], while the sins were deemed by the sages to be the sources of all crimes and banned to protect researchers from a careless pursuit of knowledge. They are the base of the Akedemiya's rules, and the sages have been adding new rules and amendments ever since.<ref name="cyno story 5">{{Ref/CS|Cyno|5}}</ref> Researching topics that are related to these sins will expose oneself to punishments, such as expulsion from the Akademiya or imprisonment.<ref>''Mechanical Life Forms Research Data'' and ''Secret Text Interpretation Manual'', {{Ref/Quest|All Returns to Silence}}</ref>

The virtues are as follows:<!--These are summaries of the books' first two sentences-->
* [[Admonition Book|Admonition]]: Admonition is the branches of the nation of wisdom. It comes from a pure heart and is to be paired with wise thinking affording humble words clarity and good deeds conferring real meaning upon what is said.
* [[Ingenuity Book|Ingenuity]]: Ingenuity is the leaf-veins of the nation of wisdom. It springs forth from benevolent consideration, sets words of integrity on the right path and should be completed by harmonious conduct.
* [[Praxis Book|Praxis]]: Praxes are the roots of the nation of wisdom. They stem from an unwavering will, validate words of honesty and bring forth the fruit of wisdom.

The sins are as follows:<ref name="cyno story 5" />
* Interfering with human evolution,
* Tampering with life and death,
* Delving beyond the universe,
* Investigating the origin of words,
* Revering gods without acts of devotion, and
* Attempting the forbidden and fearing none.

===Academics===
Nowadays, obtaining a degree from the Akademiya is a notoriously long and stressful process; [[Gregor]] who had been admitted, states that he will be old by the time he graduates and sees his parents again.<ref name="Cat's Tail">{{Ref/BB|Cat's Tail Message Board|Chosen by the Sage}}</ref> [[Hosseini]] states that it is not uncommon for people to graduate after the age of 30, and that he himself, being less than said age, has his hair turned near-gray from his research.<ref name="Energy Amplifier Initiation">{{Ref/NPC|Hosseini|s=1}}</ref>

Thesis defenses are by far the most difficult part of graduating; several of the Driyosh met in other nations express their anxiety over finding material for their theses and have changed their subjects due to extenuating circumstances or rejection from the review panel. [[Alrani]] downright fears the Akademiya, and mentions that [[Soraya]] &mdash; who is apparently among the top of her class &mdash; has "piles of rejected manuscripts."<ref name="Endless Research">{{Ref/Quest|Endless Research}}</ref> It is implied there is a limit to how long a student can stay at the Akademiya without being able to graduate.<ref name="Fertilizer Salesperson">{{Ref/Quest|Fertilizer... Salesperson?}}</ref> Hosseini mentions that if he were to become a Dastur, he could stay at the Akademiya longer instead of having to travel around Teyvat to conduct research.<ref name="Shadow Ancients">{{Ref/NPC|Hosseini|s=2}}</ref>

[[Lisa]], who attended the Akademiya in her youth, managed to graduate in two years under "advanced study" and is considered to be their best student in 200 years. However, she is not fond of her alma mater after realizing the cost of "uninhibited erudition," having witnessed raving-mad scholars in Sumeru's forests and sages sitting in underutilized councils. She ultimately returned to [[Mondstadt]] and became a humble librarian,<ref name="Lisa CS 5">{{Ref/CS|Lisa|5}}</ref> a decision that greatly baffles those who know how talented she is.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sayid|s=Daytime}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Albedo|About Lisa}}</ref>

===Research===
On top of academics, Sumeru Akademiya conducts research into various subjects. It is typical for traveling scholars to gather material and conduct preliminary research for their supervisors' projects and areas of interest,<ref name="Energy Amplifier Initiation" /> while researchers are allowed to stay at the Akademiya to conduct their research.<ref name="Shadow Ancients" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Facing Distant Echoes}}</ref>

After determining that no [[Electro]] Visions have been given out in the past year, scholars at the Akademiya theorized this phenomenon was related to the Electro Archon's will and in particular, the proclamation of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]].<ref name="Endless Research" /> This theory turns out to be incorrect when [[Raiden Ei]] reveals to the [[Traveler]] that she was unaware this phenomenon was occurring, and that Archons are not directly involved in the granting or denial of Visions. Due to "certain constraints," she could not say what actually caused the halt in Electro Visions.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About the Vision}}</ref>

While research at the Akademiya tends to lean towards study of ancient history, the arcane, elemental energy, and the fundamental basis of the world, it also bears research of the more scientific and practical variety. For example, [[Tsuyuko]]'s education at Sumeru Akademiya has led her to believe that Watatsumi Island's Holy Soil phenomenon is not because [[Enkanomiya]] is trying to absorb the spirit of the island, which is the legendary explanation, but because seawater that touches the soil leaches its nutrients and washes them away; rather than suppress Enkanomiya, the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]] replenishes the soil's nutrients.<ref name="The Moon-Bathed Deep">{{Ref/Quest|The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest)}}</ref> It is later revealed that Holy Soil is the result of the expansion of the [[Light Realm]], whose elemental currents are strong in Enkanomiya, while the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri reverses the phenomenon by awakening the [[Coral Butterfly|Sangacorallia]], creatures that can break down the Light Realm's powerful elemental energy into something more usable by the [[Human Realm]] which Teyvat is part of.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref>

Every year, the Akademiya chooses a recipient for the Pir Kavikavus Prize, an award given out to a young scholar under 40 years old, whose research submission is considered "groundbreaking" and "creative," and the submitter has "great potential." Recipients of this prize have all gone on to win great renown in the Akademiya.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Spike Self-Circulation Report: Abstract (Part 1)}}</ref>

Research into mechanical lifeforms is banned in the Akademiya, with students caught doing so running the risk of being expelled. It was initially tolerated and popular among those of the Spantamad but when overzealous researchers began to perform unregulated vivisections and other cruel experiments on animals, it was immediately banned.

===Academic Progression===
A few different honorifics and titles have been mentioned in relation to a person's progress in their research and studies at Sumeru Akademiya.
* '''Driyosh''', commonly called ''traveling scholars'', are students who have been granted leave from Sumeru Akademiya to wander and learn as part of their research process.<ref name="Fertilizer Salesperson" /> Passing one thesis through the review process is enough to graduate from the Akademiya, after which they may be considered formal researchers.<ref name="Shadow Ancients" />
** There is another subset of students who are confined within the Akademiya and do not leave until they graduate or otherwise cut their education short.<ref name="Cat's Tail" /><ref name="Henry Morton">{{Ref/NPC|Henry Morton}}</ref> So far, no honorific has been ascribed to students of this type.
* '''Dastur''' are formal researchers who have passed two theses through the review process.<ref name="Shadow Ancients" /><ref name="Solitary Sea-Beast">{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Sea-Beast}}</ref>
* '''Herbad''' are researchers of high prestige who have immense knowledge and hold leadership positions.<ref name="Shadow Ancients" />
* The '''Six Great Sages''', also commonly referred to as just '''sages''', are the scholars with the highest positions of power in the Akademiya.<ref name="Araby">{{Ref/NPC|Araby}}</ref> They are chosen based on a set of criteria to serve as leaders of the Six Great Schools,<ref name="Toast">{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref> one sage per Darshan. They are granted administrative power over the Akademiya and also sit on advisory councils.<ref name="Lisa CS 5" /> Some of their duties include assigning jobs and duties to researchers;<ref name="Araby" /> for example, the role of the Grand Conservator.<ref name="Homayun">{{Ref/NPC|Homayun}}</ref>
* The '''Grand Sage''' is the absolute leader of the Akademiya. This role and title are cumulative with the one of Grand Sage, but little is currently known about what specific additional functions and powers this title implies. The Grand Sage's office<!-- or at least Azar's--> is located above the [[House of Daena]].

===Governance===
The Sumeru Akademiya manages much of the day-to-day affairs of Sumeru and is responsible for managing the Akasha System, a system which manages knowledge as a resource that anyone wearing an Akasha Terminal can access. The knowledge in the Akasha is compiled from the wisdom of the populace,<ref name="The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival">{{Ref/Quest|The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival}}</ref> and the information a person receives is heavily regulated by the Akasha.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in Prosperity}}</ref> [[Yae Miko]] ponders whether this system was thought up by Lesser Lord Kusanali or by the sages;<ref name="Wishes">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref> however, it was revealed that the Akasha was the work of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].<ref name="Dawn">{{Ref/Quest|Dawn (Quest)}}</ref>

The Akasha is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power, but [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] has little to no role in managing it. But as the First Akasha Terminal, she has always had her consciousness linked to the Akasha, giving her the ability to occupy the consciousness of anyone wearing an Akasha Terminal. However, she has only occupied the bionic puppet [[Katheryne]]'s consciousness, out of respect for her people's free will.<ref name="Dawn" />

It is revealed that the Akademiya sages (and by extension the entire government) are corrupt; following [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s death, the sages were disappointed with the newly born [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s lack of intelligence and thus sought to replace their god in an attempt to control knowledge and restore [[Irminsul]]. After [[Il Dottore]] returned to Sumeru to offer his assistance in making a new god, four of the six sages began harvesting divine knowledge from crazed scholars at a secret facility, using the Akasha to create a dream samsara to harvest energy and spreading misinformation about the [[King Deshret]]'s revival. The [[Amurta]] sage [[Naphis]] and the [[Vahumana]] sage opposed the plan, only to be locked up by the other sages in response. The sages modified [[Scaramouche]] even further to create their new god.

The Akademiya is also authoritarian, banning the transmission of information by non-Akademiya sources<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sulaykha}}</ref><ref name="More About Tighnari: III">{{Ref/VO|Tighnari|More About Tighnari: III}}</ref> and requiring plays to be approved by the Akademiya and to focus on Akademiya-approved themes,<ref>{{Ref/BB|Zubayr Theater Billboard}}</ref> before ultimately prohibiting public art performances altogether.<ref name="Coming">{{Ref/Quest|The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival}}</ref>

After Scaramouche was defeated by the Traveler and Kusanali, Azar and the other three sages that collaborated with him were removed from their posts, with Naphis and the Vahumana sage being released from the imprisonment Azar had inflicted them. Four new sages are to be selected in a process personally overseen by Lesser Lord Kusanali. [[Alhaitham]] was offered the position of Grand Sage, but he refused. Nevertheless, Alhaitham became the Acting Grand Sage to manage the Akademiya's important affairs before the new sages take office.<ref name="Toast"/> He would ultimately resign and return to being its Scribe, leaving the Akademiya without a clear leader for the time being.<ref name=PaP>{{Ref/Quest|Pride and Prejudice}}</ref>

==Structure==
===The Six Darshans===
Sumeru Akademiya is currently divided into Six Darshans, each of which has a specialty and a designated color for their uniform.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sitt}}</ref> The first Darshans were established at the same time as the Akdemiya itself by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] under the name of Six Great Schools, each representing a type of wisdom are led by a Great Sage. Although additional Darshans separate from these Schools have been created throughout history, only the Six Great Schools have stood the test of time. Nowadays, the Six Darshans and the Six Great Schools are nearly synonymous.<ref name="Toast"/>

==Other Institutes==
===Birmastan===
{{main|Bimarstan}}
The Birmastan provides free medical treatments from the Akademiya to residents of Sumeru. The doctors here are researchers and students from Amurta.

===House of Daena===
{{main|House of Daena}}
The Akademiya's library, although it is now used much less often due to the Akademiya's the recent push towards relying on the [[Akasha]]. Researchers and students can borrow books here on general knowledge. Some books are only open to higher-level researchers for use in their literature reviews. The House of Daena is run by a Grand Conservator, who is in charge of the library's collections.

The Akademiya is seeking a new Grand Conservator after the previous one declared his retirement; the current top two candidates are Rifaet and Vikram.

===Pardis Dhyai===
{{main|Pardis Dhyai}}
Pardis Dhyai is a research center for botany run by Amurta. Tighnari maintains close relations with the researchers at Pardis Dhyai, even though he usually avoids Sumeru City and the Akademiya itself.

==Administrative Personnel==
===Matra===
{{main|Matra}}
The Matra<ref group="Note" name="Mata-matra" /> are administrative officials in the Akademiya that hand out disciplinary actions to researchers who have committed serious academic offenses.<ref>HoYoLab: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/7118146 The law is just, and there is no escape for the guilty]</ref> They also inspect for illegal sources of information, such as [[Canned Knowledge]]<ref>{{Ref/BB|Diwan Bulletin Board|Canned Knowledge}}</ref> and presumably, smuggled books.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Caravan Ribat Bulletin Board|Making a Fortune}}</ref>

===The Navbed===
The Navbed are administrative officiers who manage Sumeru's trade affairs and taxes.
* [[Shahbandar]] &mdash; The Navbed (Sumeru City)

* [[Reza]] &mdash; Port Master (Port Ormos)
* [[Masrur]] &mdash; Deputy Port Master (Port Ormos)
* [[Dilawar]] &mdash; Trade Supervisor, [[Wikala Funduq]] (Port Ormos)
* [[Gauhar]] &mdash; Trade Supervisor, Wikala Funduq (Port Ormos)

===Vizier===

* [[Nizam]] &mdash; Vizier
* [[Fariha]] &mdash; Secretary

==Affiliated Organizations==
===Corps of Thirty===
{{main|Corps of Thirty}}
The Corps of Thirty are members of the [[Eremite]] Tribe who are permanently hired by the sages of Sumeru Akademiya to keep the peace in Sumeru City. [[Effendi]] is the Akademiya's liaison officier to the Corps of Thirty.

===Fatui===
{{main|Fatui}}
According to consummate liar [[Kasim]], some of the Akademiya's sages are "officially affiliated" with the Fatui.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Foolish Fatuus}}</ref> While little evidence towards this statement can currently be found, the sage Siman Farrokhazad<ref>{{Ref/Location|Bimarstan|note=Medical History of Giyath Khayyam|quote="Amurta announced that the sage Siman Farrokhzad would ensure the patient's treatment is underway..."}}</ref> may have some connection to a group of The Eremites known as The Farrokhzadan, who were trying to capture [[Aranara]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Starry Night Chapter}}</ref> &mdash; which is a project Il Dottore is stated to be pursuing at present.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|The Bad Guy in Vimara Village}}</ref>

===Nagarjunites===
{{main|Nagarjunites}}
The Nagarjunites were a branch of the Akademiya long ago but have long since broken off. While it is believed to still have some followers in the desert region, many people in the forest region have relegated them to myth. The Nagarjunites advocated "strange ideals" like "the transmission of knowledge at all cost" and "conflict is the natural order of Teyvat." The book ''[[An Ode to Soul-Light]]'' mentions a figure named Nagarjuna, who is presumably the originator of the school.

==Trivia==
* According to Henry Morton, there are few opportunities to use [[Wind Gliders]] on Akademiya grounds.<ref name="Henry Morton" />

===Etymology===
* The English name uses the Ancient Greek term {{Lang|{{w|Platonic Academy|Akademiya}}|grc=Ἀκαδημία|grc_rm=Akademía}}, a prominent school founded by the philosopher {{w|Plato}}, from which a common noun "academy" was derived. This emphasizes the scientific and philosophical natures of the Academy.
* The Chinese name uses a term literally meaning an {{Lang|"institute of religious decree"|zh=教令院}}, where {{Lang|"religious decree"|zh=教令}} is also used to refer to the {{w|Decree (Catholic canon law)|decree}} in Catholic canon law or the {{w|fatwa}} in Islamic law. This emphasizes the theological and juridical natures of the Academy.
** The Japanese name follows the Chinese interpretation, while the Korean name follows the English interpretation.
* The "Six Darshans" is derived from the {{Lang|{{w|Hindu philosophy#Classifications|ṣaḍdarśana}}|sa=षड्दर्शन|sa_lit=six views, six insights}},<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/shaddarshana Shaddarshana, Ṣaḍdarśana]</ref> the six Āstika schools of Hindu philosophy.
* Several terms related to Sumeru Akademiya are derived from {{w|Zoroastrianism}} and the {{w|Avestan}} language:
** The Chinese equivalent for the Six Darshans is {{Lang|"Six Great Schools"|zh=六大学派}}, which is derived from the Chinese common name for the Zoroastrian {{w|Amesha Spenta}}, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=六大天使|zh_lit=Six Great Celestial Messengers (Angels)}},<ref>Wikipedia (Chinese), {{w|zh:阿梅沙·斯彭塔|{{zh|阿梅沙・斯彭塔}}}}</ref> who are six divine emanations of {{w|Ahura Mazda}}, the creator deity in Zoroastrianism whose name translates to "Lord [of] Wisdom." They are named in the {{w|Gatha (Zoroaster)|Gathas}}, a collection of 17 songs recorded in the {{w|Avesta}}.
** In both English and Chinese, the names of the Darshans are based on the deities in the Amesha Spenta: [[Amurta]] is derived from {{w|Ameretat}} (Amerdad), [[Haravatat]] from {{w|Haurvatat}}, [[Kshahrewar]] from {{w|Kshatra Vairya}} (Šahrewar), [[Spantamad]] from {{w|Spenta Armaiti}} (Spandarmad), [[Rtawahist]] from {{w|Asha|Asha Vahista}} (Ashawahist) and [[Vahumana]] from {{w|Vohu Manah}} (Wahman). (See each Darshan's Etymology section for details.)
** The Avestan/Farsi-based honorifics within Sumeru Akademiya are notably transcribed phonetically in the original Chinese version, where foreign terms and concepts are usually translated into Chinese instead.
*** Each of the Six Darshans has two names in the Chinese version &mdash; one is based on the school's specialty while the other is a phonetic transcription of the Avestan-inspired name. For example, Spantamad is referred to as both {{zh|素论派|rm=Sùlùn-pài|tl=the School of Elements}} and {{zh|悉般多摩|rm= Xībānduōmó|tl=Spantamad.}} In the English localization, both names are typically rendered as the Avestan-inspired name.
*** {{Lang|Driyosh|zh=帝利耶悉|zh_rm=Dìlìyēxī}}, the term for traveling scholars who have not achieved Dastur status, is taken from the Middle Persian {{Lang|mini=1|pal={{wt|dlgwš}}|pal_rm=driyōš}}, meaning "poor" or "one who lives in holy indigence," which itself is derived from the Avestan {{Lang|mini=1|ae=𐬛𐬭𐬌𐬔𐬎|ae_rm=drigu|ae_tl=needy, mendicant.}}
**** The Middle Persian ''driyōš'' is the root of the word {{Lang|''{{W|dervish}}''|fa=درویش|fa_rm=darviš}}, learnèd ascetics who sought spiritual merit and salvation through self-imposed poverty (mendicancy).<ref>Encyclopedia Iranica: [https://iranicaonline.org/articles/darvis Darvīš]</ref>
*** {{Lang|Dastur|zh=陀裟多|zh_rm=Tuóshāduō}}, one of Sumeru Akademiya's honorifics for researchers, is likely derived from the Zoroastrian high priest title {{Lang|"{{w|dastur}}"|fa=دستور|fa_rm=dastur|fa_lit=hand-fist}}.
*** {{Lang|{{w|Herbad}}|zh=诃般荼|zh_rm=Hēbōtú}}, which ranks above Dastur in Sumeru Akademiya's hierarchy, was originally a term for Zoroastrian high priests who taught sacred texts to others, as well as translated and interpreted the Avesta. Later on, however, Herbad lost its prestigious rank and became the lowest rank of priests, with the Mobad above them and Dastur as the highest rank.
** The Kavikavus Prize may be derived from the mythological shah {{w|Kay Kāvus}}, a king of the {{w|Kayanian dynasty}}. Among Kay Kāvus' legends is his invention of a flying throne propelled by ravenous eagles, which managed to transport the king to China before the eagles grew tired and dropped the throne.
* Other titles:
** "Sage" was the first title at Sumeru Akademiya to be mentioned in-game and perhaps because of that, is not a transcription of another language's terminology. In the original Chinese text, two different terms are used for this title: {{Lang|mini=1|zh=贤者|zh_rm=Xiánzhě|zh_tl=Person of Talent}} is the more common form,<ref name="Cat's Tail" /><ref name="Wishes" /><ref name="Solitary Sea-Beast" /> while {{Lang|mini=1|zh=智者|zh_rm=Zhìzhě|zh_tl=Sage, Wise Man}} has also been used.<ref name="Lisa CS 5" />
** {{lang|{{w|Mahamatra}}|sa=महामात्र|sa_rm=mahāmātra|sa_tl=Officer of High Rank}}, full title ''Dhaṃma Mahāmātā'', were "officers of morality" established by the Indian emperor {{w|Ashoka}} and were in charge of religious affairs. In Chinese, this title is translated as {{lang|mini=1|zh=大风纪官|zh_rm=Dà Fēngjì Guān|zh_tl=Great Disciplinary Official}} instead of being phonetically transcribed from Sanskrit.
