The '''Sumeru Akademiya''' is [[Sumeru]]'s main governing body, as well as the most prestigious institute of learning in all of [[Teyvat]], located in the middle of the tree trunk of [[Sumeru City]]. It is particularly renowned for its corpus in arcane arts and historical records.

==Overview==
The Akademiya accepts students from all over Teyvat and often sends traveling scholars, known as Driyosh, to other nations to gather material for research. It is unknown how long the Akademiya has existed, but it was already a prestigious institute by the time of the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago.<ref name="WET">{{Ref/Arti|Witch's End Time}}</ref> According to [[Dainsleif]], the Akademiya is a millennia-old institution, meaning it was founded over 1000 years ago.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/HHm6QptfeYU Collected Miscellany - "Cyno: Path of the Lone Wolf"]</ref> The Akademiya also takes a role as a governing body of Sumeru handling much of the day-to-day affairs of Sumeru.

===Virtues and Sins===
The Akademiya has three virtues and six sins. The virtues are described in Sumeru's [[Talent Level-Up Material#Sumeru|Talent Level-Up Books]], while the sins were deemed by the sages to be the sources of all crimes and banned to protect researchers from a careless pursuit of knowledge. They are the base of the Akademiya's rules, and the sages have been adding new rules and amendments ever since.<ref name="cyno story 5">{{Ref/CS|Cyno|5}}</ref> Researching topics that are related to these sins will expose oneself to punishments, such as expulsion from the Akademiya or imprisonment.<ref>''Mechanical Life Forms Research Data'' and ''Secret Text Interpretation Manual'', {{Ref/Quest|All Returns to Silence}}</ref>

The virtues are as follows: <!--These are summaries of the books' first two sentences-->
* [[Admonition Book|Admonition]]: Admonition is the branches of the nation of wisdom. It comes from a pure heart and is to be paired with wise thinking affording humble words clarity and good deeds conferring real meaning upon what is said.
* [[Ingenuity Book|Ingenuity]]: Ingenuity is the leaf-veins of the nation of wisdom. It springs forth from benevolent consideration, sets words of integrity on the right path and should be completed by harmonious conduct.
* [[Praxis Book|Praxis]]: Praxes are the roots of the nation of wisdom. They stem from an unwavering will, validate words of honesty and bring forth the fruit of wisdom.

The sins are as follows:<ref name="cyno story 5" />
* Interfering with human evolution,
* Tampering with life and death,
* Delving beyond the universe,
* Investigating the origin of words,
* Revering [[god]]s without acts of devotion, and
* Attempting the forbidden and fearing none.

===Academics===
While it boasts a university-like setting, the Akademiya admits students of all ages, and children can be enrolled in the Akademiya once they reach schooling age if they pass the entrance exams. [[Arina]] and [[Armin]] are two known current child students, with past child enrollees including [[Alhaitham]], who enrolled at the age of seven before being homeschooled for a time, [[Sachin]], who enrolled at the age of nine, and [[Kaveh]], who enrolled in the Akademiya when he reached schooling age, although his age at the time of enrollment was not specified beyond him being "young".<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaveh|5}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Alhaitham|5}}</ref> [[Uzayr]], [[Shurayh]], and [[Tanisha]] are also children who plan to take the Akademiya entrance exams after learning the fundamentals of architecture.<ref name="Treasure and True Interest">{{Ref/Quest|Treasure and True Interest}}</ref> <!--As for teenage enrollments, [[Layla]] resembles a teenager and is said to have recently enrolled in the Akademiya, at least a year before [[Chapter III]] began.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Layla|1}}</ref>--> [[Collei]] is expected to enroll into the Akademiya once she finishes up her studies.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wondrous Times}}</ref>

Although it is implied that there is a certain age at which prospective students should attempt the entrance exams and enroll in the Akademiya, doing so is not compulsory, as only those who pass the challenging entrance exams are admitted, making it unlikely that many students are actually able to study there.<ref name="Treasure and True Interest"/> Those who are unable to attend school in the Akademiya rely on the [[Akasha System]], independent studies, or training centers to acquire knowledge.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Nilou|1}}</ref>

Students in the Akademiya commonly refer to each other as seniors and juniors; however, earning the title of senior is determined by academic progress rather than age. Tighnari, for example, is younger than [[Abattouy]], but is referred to as his senior because Tighnari completed his studies and graduated from the Akademiya before Abattouy.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Heart of the Machine}}</ref>

Nowadays, obtaining a degree from the Akademiya is a notoriously long and stressful process; [[Gregor]] a student from [[Mondstadt]], fears that his parents will be old by the time he graduates and returns to Mondstadt.<ref name="Cat's Tail">{{Ref/BB|Cat's Tail Message Board|Chosen by the Sage}}</ref> [[Hosseini]] states that it is not uncommon for people to graduate after the age of 30, and that he himself, being less than said age, has his hair turned near-gray from his research.<ref name="Energy Amplifier Initiation">{{Ref/NPC|Hosseini|s=1}}</ref>

Thesis defenses are by far the most difficult part of graduating; several of the Driyosh met in other nations express their anxiety over finding material for their theses and have changed their subjects due to extenuating circumstances or rejection from the review panel. [[Alrani]] downright fears the Akademiya, and mentions that [[Soraya]] &mdash; who is apparently among the top of her class &mdash; has "piles of rejected manuscripts."<ref name="Endless Research">{{Ref/Quest|Endless Research}}</ref> It is implied there is a limit to how long a student can stay at the Akademiya without being able to graduate.<ref name="Fertilizer Salesperson">{{Ref/Quest|Fertilizer... Salesperson?}}</ref> Hosseini mentions that if he were to become a Dastur, he could stay at the Akademiya longer instead of having to travel around Teyvat to conduct research.<ref name="Shadow Ancients">{{Ref/NPC|Hosseini|s=2}}</ref>

[[Lisa]], who attended the Akademiya in her youth, managed to graduate in two years under "advanced study" and is considered to be their best student in 200 years. However, she is not fond of her alma mater after realizing the cost of "uninhibited erudition," having witnessed raving-mad scholars in Sumeru's forests and sages sitting in underutilized councils. She ultimately returned to [[Mondstadt]] and became a humble librarian,<ref name="Lisa CS 5">{{Ref/CS|Lisa|5}}</ref> a decision that greatly baffles those who know how talented she is.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sayid|s=Daytime}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Albedo|About Lisa}}</ref>

===Research===
On top of academics, Sumeru Akademiya conducts research into various subjects. It is typical for traveling scholars to gather material and conduct preliminary research for their supervisors' projects and areas of interest,<ref name="Energy Amplifier Initiation" /> while researchers are allowed to stay at the Akademiya to conduct their research.<ref name="Shadow Ancients" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Facing Distant Echoes}}</ref>

After determining that no [[Electro]] Visions have been given out in the past year, scholars at the Akademiya theorized this phenomenon was related to the Electro Archon's will and in particular, the proclamation of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]].<ref name="Endless Research" /> This theory turns out to be incorrect when [[Ei]] reveals to the [[Traveler]] that she was unaware this phenomenon was occurring, and that Archons are not directly involved in the granting or denial of Visions. Due to "certain constraints," she could not say what actually caused the halt in Electro Visions.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About the Vision}}</ref>

While research at the Akademiya tends to lean towards study of ancient history, the arcane, elemental energy, and the fundamental bases of the world, it also bears research of the more scientific and practical variety. For example, [[Tsuyuko]]'s education at Sumeru Akademiya has led her to believe that Watatsumi Island's Holy Soil phenomenon is not because [[Enkanomiya]] is trying to absorb the spirit of the island, which is the legendary explanation, but because seawater that touches the soil leaches its nutrients and washes them away; rather than suppress Enkanomiya, the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]] replenishes the soil's nutrients.<ref name="The Moon-Bathed Deep">{{Ref/Quest|The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest)}}</ref> It is later revealed that Holy Soil is the result of the expansion of the [[Light Realm]], whose elemental currents are strong in Enkanomiya, while the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri reverses the phenomenon by awakening the [[Coral Butterfly|Sangacorallia]], creatures that can break down the Light Realm's powerful elemental energy into something more usable by the [[Human Realm]] which Teyvat is part of.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref>

Every year, the Akademiya chooses a recipient for the Pir Kavikavus Prize, an award given out to a young scholar under 40 years old, whose research submission is considered "groundbreaking" and "creative," and the submitter has "great potential." Past recipients of this prize have all gone on to win great renown in the Akademiya.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Spike Self-Circulation Report: Abstract (Part 1)}}</ref>

Research into mechanical lifeforms is banned in the Akademiya, with students caught doing so running the risk of being expelled. It was initially tolerated and popular among those of Spantamad but when overzealous researchers began to perform unregulated vivisections and other cruel experiments on animals, it was immediately banned.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Into the Hinterland}}</ref>

===Academic Progression===
A few different honorifics and titles have been mentioned in relation to a person's progress in their research and studies at Sumeru Akademiya.
* '''Driyosh''', commonly called ''traveling scholars'', are students who have been granted leave from Sumeru Akademiya to wander and learn as part of their research process.<ref name="Fertilizer Salesperson" /> Passing one thesis through the review process is enough to graduate from the Akademiya, after which they may be considered formal researchers.<ref name="Shadow Ancients" />
** There is another subset of students who are confined within the Akademiya and do not leave until they graduate or otherwise cut their education short.<ref name="Cat's Tail" /><ref name="Henry Morton">{{Ref/NPC|Henry Morton}}</ref> So far, no honorific has been ascribed to students of this type.
* '''Dastur''' are formal researchers who have passed two theses through the review process.<ref name="Shadow Ancients" /><ref name="Solitary Sea-Beast">{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Sea-Beast}}</ref>
* '''Herbad''' are researchers of high prestige who have immense knowledge and hold leadership positions.<ref name="Shadow Ancients" />
* The '''Six Great Sages''', also commonly referred to as just '''sages''', are the scholars with the highest positions of power in the Akademiya.<ref name="Araby">{{Ref/NPC|Araby}}</ref> They are chosen based on a set of criteria to serve as leaders of the Six Great Schools,<ref name="Toast">{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref> one sage per Darshan. They are granted administrative power over the Akademiya and also sit on advisory councils.<ref name="Lisa CS 5" /> Some of their duties include assigning jobs and duties to researchers;<ref name="Araby" /> for example, the role of the Grand Conservator.<ref name="Homayun">{{Ref/NPC|Homayun}}</ref>
* The '''Grand Sage''' is the absolute leader of the Akademiya. This role and title are cumulative with the one of Grand Sage, but little is currently known about what specific additional functions and powers this title implies. The Grand Sage's office<!-- or at least Azar's--> is located above the [[House of Daena]].

===Governance===
The Sumeru Akademiya manages much of the day-to-day affairs of Sumeru and is responsible for managing the Akasha System, a system which manages knowledge as a resource that anyone wearing an Akasha Terminal can access. The knowledge in the Akasha is compiled from the wisdom of the populace,<ref name="The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival">{{Ref/Quest|The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival}}</ref> and the information a person receives is heavily regulated by the Akasha.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in Prosperity}}</ref> [[Yae Miko]] ponders whether this system was thought up by Lesser Lord Kusanali or by the sages;<ref name="Wishes">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref> however, it was revealed that the Akasha was the work of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].<ref name="Dawn">{{Ref/Quest|Dawn (Quest)}}</ref>

The Akasha is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power, but [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] has little to no role in managing it. But as the First Akasha Terminal, she has always had her consciousness linked to the Akasha, giving her the ability to occupy the consciousness of anyone wearing an Akasha Terminal. However, she has only occupied the bionic puppet [[Katheryne]]'s consciousness, out of respect for her people's free will.<ref name="Dawn" />

It is revealed that the Akademiya sages are corrupt; following [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s death, the sages were disappointed with the newly born [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s lack of intelligence and thus sought to replace their god in an attempt to control knowledge and restore [[Irminsul]]. After [[Il Dottore]] returned to Sumeru to offer his assistance in making a new god, four of the six sages began harvesting divine knowledge from crazed scholars at a secret facility, using the Akasha to create a dream samsara to harvest energy and spreading misinformation about the [[King Deshret]]'s revival. The [[Amurta]] sage [[Naphis]] and the [[Vahumana]] sage opposed the plan, only to be locked up by the other sages in response. The sages modified [[Scaramouche]] even further to create their new god.

The Akademiya under their rule was authoritarian, banning the transmission of information by non-Akademiya sources<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sulaykha}}</ref><ref name="More About Tighnari: III">{{Ref/VO|Tighnari|More About Tighnari: III}}</ref> and requiring plays to be approved by the Akademiya and to focus on Akademiya-approved themes,<ref>{{Ref/BB|Zubayr Theater Billboard}}</ref> before ultimately prohibiting public art performances altogether.<ref name="Coming">{{Ref/Quest|The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival}}</ref> Even books, ironically enough, were not allowed to be openly sold to the general public. Only after Kusanali took control could material like Inazuman light novels be found in the marketplace.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Essential Classic}}</ref>

The Akademiya also has a significant influence on how the rest of Sumeru thinks, as their radical views that deemed artistic expression to have no benefits quickly caused the rest of Sumeru to adopt the same viewpoint, resulting in citizens valuing scholarly accomplishments and practicality above all else, and leading to the marginalization of those involved in the arts. The Akademiya's demeaning of the arts spread to all forms of artistic expression, whether in painting, vendor performances at [[Port Ormos]], dancing, or even architecture, due to the value placed on practicality over aesthetics.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaveh|3}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Layla|3}}</ref> Even after [[Chapter III]] and the exile of the Sages, the Akademiya's influence still persists in some form in Sumeru, as discussing the arts is still considered the quickest way to kill a conversation.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sixth Proposal}}</ref>

After Scaramouche was defeated by the Traveler and Kusanali, Azar and the other three sages that collaborated with him were removed from their posts, with Naphis and the Vahumana sage being released from their imprisonment. Four new sages are to be selected in a process personally overseen by Lesser Lord Kusanali. [[Alhaitham]] was offered the position of Grand Sage, but he refused. Nevertheless, Alhaitham became the Acting Grand Sage to manage the Akademiya's important affairs before the new sages take office.<ref name="Toast" /> Out of concern that "Acting" would sooner or later become "Official", he would ultimately resign and return to being its Scribe, leaving the Akademiya without a clear leader for the time being.<ref name="PaP">{{Ref/Quest|Pride and Prejudice}}</ref>

It is revealed in Kaveh's [[Hangout Event]] Act I - [[The Pendulum of Weal and Woe]] that training centers have opened up across Sumeru to prep citizens who are unable to enroll into the Akademiya for certain career paths, such as in architecture. However, some of these training centers, such as [[Alkami]]'s, are scams that prey on citizens' desperation. The Akademiya is revealed to be unaware of these fraudulent training centers, and Kaveh speculates that they are unlikely to take action against them even if they were to find out because they have all of the necessary permits and certifications to stay in business.<ref name="Treasure and True Interest" />

==Structure==
===The Six Darshans===
Sumeru Akademiya is currently divided into Six Darshans, each of which has a specialty and a designated color for their uniform.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sitt}}</ref> The first Darshans were established at the same time as the Akademiya itself by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] under the name of Six Great Schools, each representing a type of wisdom. Each school is led by a Great Sage, and the central leader among them holds the position of Grand Sage. Although additional Darshans separate from these Schools have been created throughout history, only the Six Great Schools have stood the test of time. Nowadays, the Six Darshans and the Six Great Schools are nearly synonymous.<ref name="Toast" />

===Mahamata===
The '''Mahamata'''<ref group="Note" name="Mata-matra">Based on the original Chinese text, the {{lang|Mahamata|zh=教令官|zh_tl=Religious Decree Official}} are likely a different group from the {{lang|Matra|zh=风纪官|zh_tl=Disciplinary Official}}. Note that {{zh|教令|rm=Jiāolìng|tl=Religious Decree}} is also in the Chinese name for Sumeru Akademiya.</ref> are the civil administrative officials of Sumeru Akademiya. They are Akademiya alumni dispatched throughout Sumeru to oversee the transmission and integrity of information among the public,<ref name="current">{{Ref/BB|Akademiya Public Message Board|The Current Akademiya}}</ref><ref name="The Scribe">{{Ref/BB|Port Ormos Bulletin Board|Mahamata}}</ref> relay and ensure compliance with decrees implemented by the Akademiya,<ref>{{Ref/BB|Mahamata Bulletin Board}}</ref> and regulate various Akademiya-run public services, such as trade<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Barmak}}</ref> and healthcare.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Nevida}}</ref> They are also sent to investigate incidents which may threaten public safety.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Afratu's Dilemma}}</ref>

Public opinion of the Mahamata is mixed; some consider the newer Mahamata to be inefficient in their work and believe they could be replaced by the Akasha System, though with the system's shutdown this is unlikely to change.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Akademiya Public Message Board|Akasha and Mahamata}}</ref> It is also suggested that the Akademiya may forcibly assign students to become Mahamata regardless of the student's own intent. This has been criticized as subverting the Akademiya's goals of education, though others argue that the Mahamata are important because they distribute the Akademiya's knowledge to the public.<ref name="current" />

The '''Scribe''', a position currently held by [[Alhaitham]], belongs to the Mahamata.<ref name="The Scribe" /> The title of '''Inspector''', which currently belongs to an unidentified woman, may also be part of the Mahamata.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Port Ormos Bulletin Board|Amandeep's Advertisement}}</ref>

===Temple of Silence===
{{main|Temple of Silence}}
Little is known about this body, but they are known to hold some level of authority in the Akademiya, possibly including the authority to detain researchers. In {{Quest|Oathkeeper}} however, it is revealed that the Akademiya's Temple of Silence was in fact a front, as the real Temple of Silence departed from the rainforest back to the desert 400 years prior to the events of the game due to the sages' corruption, setting up a large compound in [[Thamud Oasis]].

==Other Institutions==
===Bimarstan===
{{main|Bimarstan}}
The '''Bimarstan''' is a public hospital which provides free medical treatment from the Akademiya to residents of Sumeru. The doctors here are researchers and students from Amurta.

===House of Daena===
{{main|House of Daena}}
The '''House of Daena''' is the Akademiya's library, although it is now used much less often due to the Akademiya's recent push towards relying on the [[Akasha]]. Researchers and students can borrow books here on general knowledge. Some books are only open to higher-level researchers for use in their literature reviews. The House of Daena is run by a Grand Conservator, who is in charge of the library's collections.

The Akademiya is seeking a new Grand Conservator after the previous one declared his retirement; the current top two candidates are [[Rifaet]] and [[Vikram]].

===Pardis Dhyai===
{{main|Pardis Dhyai}}
'''Pardis Dhyai''' is a research center for botany run by Amurta. [[Tighnari]] maintains close relations with the researchers at Pardis Dhyai, despite his avoidance of Sumeru City and the Akademiya itself.

==Affiliated Organizations==
===Corps of Thirty===
{{main|Corps of Thirty}}
The '''Corps of Thirty''' are an [[The Eremites|Eremite]] mercenary brigade who are under permanent contract with the sages of Sumeru Akademiya to keep the peace in Sumeru City. [[Effendi]] is the Akademiya's liaison officer to the Corps of Thirty.

===Fatui===
{{main|Fatui}}
According to consummate liar [[Kasim]], some of the Akademiya's sages are "officially affiliated" with the [[Fatui]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Foolish Fatuus}}</ref> While little evidence towards this statement can currently be found, the sage [[Siman Farrokhzad]]<ref>{{Ref/Location|Bimarstan|note=Medical History of Giyath Khayyam|quote="Amurta announced that the sage Siman Farrokhzad would ensure the patient's treatment is underway..."}}</ref> is connected to an Eremite tribe known as the [[Farrokhzadan]], who have previously worked for the Fatui; she has ordered the tribe to search for [[Aranara]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Starry Night Chapter}}</ref> which is a project Il Dottore is stated to be pursuing at present.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|The Bad Guy in Vimara Village}}</ref>

===Order of Skeptics===
{{main|Order of Skeptics}}
The [[Order of Skeptics]], named the "Nagarjunites" by the Akademiya, was once one of the Darshans. It has long since broken off and cut ties with the Akademiya, and while it still has some followers in the [[Girdle of the Sands]] region, many people in the forest region have relegated them to myth. Their ideals include "the transmission of knowledge at all cost" and that "conflict is the natural order of Teyvat," which are deemed strange by Akademiya researchers.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Darya}}</ref> The book ''[[An Ode to Khvarena]]'' mentions a figure named Nagarjuna, who is presumably the originator of the school.

==Trivia==
* According to [[Henry Morton]], there are few opportunities to use [[Wind Gliders]] on Akademiya grounds.<ref name="Henry Morton" />
* The Akademiya has a swimming elective.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Whole New Style}}</ref>
* Students may take elective courses from Darshans they are not in, although the frequency of this occurrence is unknown.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Garden Memories}}</ref>
* {{Furnishing Mentions|name=The Sumeru Akademiya}}

===Etymology===
* The English name uses the Ancient Greek term {{Lang|{{w|Platonic Academy|Akademiya}}|grc=Ἀκαδημία|grc_rm=Akademía}}, a prominent school founded by the philosopher {{w|Plato}}, from which a common noun "academy" was derived. This emphasizes the scientific and philosophical natures of the academy.
* The Chinese name uses a term literally meaning an {{Lang|"institute of religious decree"|zh=教令院}}, where {{Lang|"religious decree"|zh=教令}} is also used to refer to the {{w|Decree (Catholic canon law)|decree}} in Catholic canon law or the {{w|fatwa}} in Islamic law. This emphasizes the theological and juridical natures of the academy.
** The Japanese name follows the Chinese interpretation, while the Korean name follows the English interpretation.
* The "Six Darshans" is derived from the {{Lang|{{w|Hindu philosophy#Classifications|ṣaḍdarśana}}|sa=षड्दर्शन|sa_lit=six views, six insights}},<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/shaddarshana Shaddarshana, Ṣaḍdarśana]</ref> the six Āstika schools of Hindu philosophy.
* Several terms related to Sumeru Akademiya are derived from {{w|Zoroastrianism}} and the {{w|Avestan}} language:
** The Chinese equivalent for the Six Darshans is {{Lang|"Six Great Schools"|zh=六大学派}}, which is derived from the Chinese common name for the Zoroastrian {{w|Amesha Spenta}}, {{zh|六大天使|lit=Six Great Celestial Messengers (Angels),}}<ref>Chinese Wikipedia: {{w|zh:阿梅沙·斯彭塔|{{zh|阿梅沙・斯彭塔}}}}</ref> who are six divine emanations of {{w|Ahura Mazda}}, the creator deity in Zoroastrianism whose name translates to "Lord [of] Wisdom." They are named in the {{w|Gatha (Zoroaster)|Gathas}}, a collection of 17 songs recorded in the {{w|Avesta}}.
** In both English and Chinese, the names of the Darshans are based on the deities in the Amesha Spenta: [[Amurta]] is derived from {{w|Ameretat}} (Amerdad), [[Haravatat]] from {{w|Haurvatat}}, [[Kshahrewar]] from {{w|Kshatra Vairya}} (Šahrewar), [[Spantamad]] from {{w|Spenta Armaiti}} (Spandarmad), [[Rtawahist]] from {{w|Asha|Asha Vahista}} (Ashawahist) and [[Vahumana]] from {{w|Vohu Manah}} (Wahman). (See each Darshan's Etymology section for details.)
** The Avestan/Farsi-based honorifics within Sumeru Akademiya are notably transcribed phonetically in the original Chinese version, where foreign terms and concepts are usually translated into Chinese instead.
*** Each of the Six Darshans has two names in the Chinese version &mdash; one is based on the school's specialty while the other is a phonetic transcription of the Avestan-inspired name. For example, Spantamad is referred to as both {{zh|素论派|rm=Sùlùn-pài|tl=the School of Elements}} and {{zh|悉般多摩|rm=Xībānduōmó|tl=Spantamad.}} In the English localization, both names are typically rendered as the Avestan-inspired name.
*** {{Lang|Driyosh|zh=帝利耶悉|zh_rm=Dìlìyēxī}}, the term for traveling scholars who have not achieved Dastur status, is taken from the Middle Persian {{Lang|mini=1|pal={{wt|dlgwš}}|pal_rm=driyōš}}, meaning "poor" or "one who lives in holy indigence," which itself is derived from the Avestan {{Lang|mini=1|ae=𐬛𐬭𐬌𐬔𐬎|ae_rm=drigu|ae_tl=needy, mendicant.}}
**** The Middle Persian ''driyōš'' is the root of the word {{Lang|''{{w|dervish}}''|fa=درویش|fa_rm=darviš}}, learnèd ascetics who sought spiritual merit and salvation through self-imposed poverty (mendicancy).<ref>Encyclopedia Iranica: [https://iranicaonline.org/articles/darvis Darvīš]</ref>
*** {{Lang|Dastur|zh=陀裟多|zh_rm=Tuóshāduō}}, one of Sumeru Akademiya's honorifics for researchers, is likely derived from the Zoroastrian high priest title {{Lang|"{{w|dastur}}"|fa=دستور|fa_rm=dastur|fa_lit=hand-fist}}.
*** {{Lang|{{w|Herbad}}|zh=诃般荼|zh_rm=Hēbōtú}}, which ranks above Dastur in Sumeru Akademiya's hierarchy, was originally a term for Zoroastrian high priests who taught sacred texts to others, as well as translated and interpreted the Avesta. Later on, however, Herbad lost its prestigious rank and became the lowest rank of priests, with the Mobad above them and Dastur as the highest rank.
** The Kavikavus Prize may be derived from the mythological shah {{w|Kay Kāvus}}, a king of the {{w|Kayanian dynasty}}. Among Kay Kāvus' legends is his invention of a flying throne propelled by ravenous eagles, which managed to transport the king to China before the eagles grew tired and dropped the throne.
* Other titles:
** "Sage" was the first title at Sumeru Akademiya to be mentioned in-game and perhaps because of that, is not a transcription of another language's terminology. In the original Chinese text, two different terms are used for this title: {{zh|贤者|rm=Xiánzhě|tl=Person of Talent}} is the more common form,<ref name="Cat's Tail" /><ref name="Wishes" /> while {{zh|智者|rm=Zhìzhě|tl=Sage, Wise Man}} has also been used.<ref name="Lisa CS 5" />
** {{lang|{{w|Mahamatra}}|sa=महामात्र|sa_rm=mahāmātra|sa_tl=Officer of High Rank}}, full title ''Dhaṃma Mahāmātā'', were "officers of morality" established by the Indian emperor {{w|Ashoka}} and were in charge of religious affairs. In Chinese, this title is translated as {{zh|大风纪官|rm=Dà Fēngjì-guān|tl=Great Disciplinary Official}} instead of being phonetically transcribed from Sanskrit.
