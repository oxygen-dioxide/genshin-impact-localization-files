'''Hydro Mimics''' are summoned by the [[Rhodeia of Loch|Oceanid]], but can also be encountered on their own during quests and in the [[Spiral Abyss]]. They resemble normal [[Wildlife]], but some are of giant proportions.

They are similar to [[Hydro Slimes]] as they are pure Hydro beings and can "walk" on deep water, thus being immune to drowning.

==Trivia==
*Each Hydro Mimic type has a weakness to a specific [[element]].
*Hydro Mimics are mostly found during the [[Oceanid]] boss fight, but they have appeared in other locations or events:
**Some appeared in [[Guyun Stone Forest]] during [[Zhongli]]'s Story Quest Act I: [[Sal Flore]].
**They appeared during the [[Wishful Drops]] event. As the event was intended to capture the mimics for quest progression, they deal minimal damage. The mimic mallards do not have their aura and flee from the player when approached or hit, much like normal mallards.
**They made appearances in specific phases of the [[Spiral Abyss]] in [[Version 1.5]] and [[Version 2.3]].
**They are encountered around [[Broken Isle]] in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]].
**They are encountered during [["Heart of Watatsumi"]], the final part of the [[The Moon-Bathed Deep]] World Quest Series.
**They may appear in some rooms of the [[Mystic Onmyou Chamber]] during [[Labyrinth Warriors]].
**Some are found in [[The Chasm/Underground Mines|the Chasm's]] underground mines.
