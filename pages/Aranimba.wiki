<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Aranimba is an [[Aranara]]. In the past, he used to stick together with [[Araminali]] and [[Arayama]], and the three of them were so happy no matter what they did. He would travel across [[Sumeru]], draw pictures of the scenery he encountered on his journey, and send them back to a mailbox in [[Vanarana]]. 

During one of his journey, Aranimba eventually ended up leaving Sumeru and entered [[The Chasm]]. There, he met a "dark and dangerous Nara", so he turned into a seed to hibernate and protect himself. However, prolonged hibernation in a place without much soil and grass dehydrated him, thus he shrunk and shrivel. The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] would eventually discover Aranimba in the form of the [[Shriveled Seed]]. 

As they travel to Sumeru, the Traveler and Paimon would eventually find his friend Araminali, who suggests that he should be given lots of water so he may restore to his original form. After a brief reunion with Araminali, Aranimba would depart on a journey again,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Static Views, Part 2}}</ref> visiting places in the [[Great Red Sand]] and [[Desert of Hadramaveth]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Aranyaka (Gadget)}}</ref>

===Personality===
