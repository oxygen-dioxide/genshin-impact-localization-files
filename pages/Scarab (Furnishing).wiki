|description    = A hardy beetle that dwells in the vast desert. Its shell has patterns on it that resemble those that mark the ancient desert ruins.<br>Legend has it that when the [[King Deshret|desert king]] ruled this land, the souls of those vanquished by him would be sealed within these insects by the magically-skilled priests at great triumphs held in the City of the Pillars. The scarabs would then be charged with defending the sacred temples and palaces for all eternity. In the end, the temples would collapse and the palaces would fall, and only these golden insects would remain, fulfilling their ancient, forgotten oaths.<br>According to [[Tubby]], these creatures have not become lax in their vigilance on account of the peaceful Realm Within, nor have they come into conflict with any of the other animals. They simply remain where they are, aloof from the affairs of the world. But when any hidden threats appear in their area of operations, such as holes that might have been created by the movement of [[Quicksand Eel]], these beetles are quick to fill them up one at a time.
