We will leave our footprints in the deserts, in the forests, and in the snowfields. In the lost Ancient City of Ys, and in Arcadia, and in golden Hyperborea.}}</ref> It is presumed to be in or near [[Snezhnaya]].

The [[Frostmoon Scions]] previously lived in Hyperborea, before abandoning it and relocating to [[Nod-Krai]].

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The word "{{w|Hyperborea}}" comes from the Greek term "ὑπερβόρε(ι)οι" or the Latin "Hyperborei." It refers to a mythical group of people who were believed to inhabit the far north of the known world. The term is derived from the Greek phrase "ὑπέρ Βορέᾱ," which translates to "Beyond Boreas," with {{w|Boreas}} being the God of the North Wind (the namesake of [[Boreas]], Wolf of the North).
** The Hyperboreans are said to dwell in the northern regions of the {{w|Riphean Mountains}}, a place that allowed them to create a "divinely blessed land" despite the frigid {{w|north wind}}. The earliest myths suggest that the Hyperboreans were favorites of {{w|Apollo}}, and some believed they were the founders of Apollo's shrines on {{w|Delos}} and {{w|Delphi}}.
