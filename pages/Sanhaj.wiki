'''Sanhaj Kompore''' was a historical figure from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] in [[Natlan]], and was one of the [[Heroes of Natlan|six warriors]] who joined forces with [[Tenoch]] in a war against the Abyss, alongside his [[Iktomisaurus]] companion Mahamba.<ref name="TS">{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref> He makes his first appearance in the form of a spiritual projection in the {{Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}.

Sanhaj bore the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name|BDI|'''Bidii'''|bearer=1}}, which has since been inherited in the present-day by [[Ororon]].

Alongside being a warrior, Sanhaj was also a high priest,<ref name="Eshu">{{Ref/Weapon|Calamity of Eshu}}</ref> revered mystic, border master, and a storyteller whose tales were about tribal warriors.

==Profile==
Sanhaj was one of the six [[Heroes of Natlan]] and part of the "original" generation of heroes. He was considered a legendary "Border Master" of the Masters of the Night-Wind, and his mastery of border spells was what turned the tide in the Battle of the [[Mare Jivari]] 500 years ago; legend has it that he summoned a miniature [[Night Kingdom]] and exploded it to defeat the approaching dark calamity. However, this was accomplished at the cost of his own life as well as Tenoch's.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Night-Wind Letter}}</ref>

Sanhaj has been shown wielding the [[Bow]] [[Chain Breaker]] in battle. The [[Sword]] [[Calamity of Eshu]] was also forged by him, but was only used for ceremonial purposes.

Sanhaj had a family by the time he died, which continued on to the present day, with [[Conulaf]] being one of his descendants.

==Story==
===500 Years Ago===
Sanhaj was born silent, which the elder who oversaw the tribe's ritual fire attributed to half his soul being lost in the night flames, so he embarked on a perilous journey to the [[Night Kingdom]] on his birthday to seek his missing self in the company of Mahamba, the most enigmatic of the Iktomisaurs. There, he experienced the past with his own eyes, including [[Xbalanque]]'s march toward the volcano and the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth]]'s victory against [[Och-Kan]]. Sanhaj also gained visions into the future, which got him realizing that all this had been [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night]]'s arrangement. He saw the coming of the [[cataclysm]] and cried out his first words as the dark fog almost touched the tribes of Natlan, only to wake up and find himself lying by a blue bonfire; Mahamba's eyes flashed with a dim light, and then the elder handed him a ceremonial staff. From that day onwards, he used tales of the past to warn people of future dangers and weaved lies from the stories to hide a past that should not be again touched.<ref name="Eshu" />

He was also the forger of the ceremonial sword [[Calamity of Eshu]] and used it to perform rituals, blurring the boundary between the [[Night Kingdom]] and the real world.<ref name="Eshu" />

Sanhaj and Tenoch sacrificed themselves during the Battle of Mare Jivari, which occurred shortly before the events of [[Sunset]]. Another one of the six heroes, [[Burkina]], perished around the same time, leaving behind [[Menilek]], [[Sundjatta]], [[Tupac]], and [[Wanjiru]]. The four of them toast in memory of Sanhaj's and Burkina's sacrifices, with Wanjiru commenting that Sanhaj had never been particularly talkative, but his death "rings loud and clear." Menilek, already drunk, loudly proclaims that Sanhaj and Burkina were heroes.

===Present Day===
Sanhaj appears before [[Ororon]] when he awakens the Ancient Name "Bidii."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref> Later, when Mavuika and the six heroes summon the power of the divine throne, Sanhaj appears alongside Ororon.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Despair Engulfs the Heavens}}</ref>
