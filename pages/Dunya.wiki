===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Dunya:''' I'll just go around the outskirts, and I promise not to break the rules and head inside, alright?
:'''Juzjani:''' As both a researcher and a doctor, I don't recommend that you go there.
:'''Juzjani:''' There used to be a hospital that the [[Akademiya]] used to study [[Eleazar]]. Entry to its ruins is prohibited now.
:'''Dunya:''' I study history, so I know all about that. I just think that I'll discover something if I can actually visit the place.
:'''Juzjani:''' Based on the record, no effective method of treatment for Eleazar has been found yet, and the hospital's ruins were sealed up.
:'''Juzjani:''' Even people from [[Aaru Village]] that is just nearby rarely go that way.
:'''Juzjani:''' I don't see the need to risk breaking the Akademiya's orders just to satisfy groundless curiosity.
:'''Dunya:''' *sigh* I really can't win in an argument against you. You medical people are just too careful.

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Dunya:''' I'll just go around the outskirts, and I promise not to break the rules and head inside, alright?
:'''Juzjani:''' As both a researcher and a doctor, I don't recommend that you go there.
:'''Juzjani:''' That was once a hospital that the Akademiya used to study Eleazar. Entry to its ruins is prohibited now.
:'''Dunya:''' Oh, come on. I study history, so I know all about that already. I just get the feeling that I'd discover something... as long as I can actually visit the place.
:'''Juzjani:''' And I think that you're trying to do something unnecessary. I mean, hasn't Eleazar essentially vanished due to Lesser Lord Kusanali's power?
:'''Juzjani:''' Even people from the nearby Aaru Village rarely pass that way, so I'd wager that there's some other dangers present there too.
:'''Dunya:''' *sigh* You know what? There's no winning an argument against you. The way I see it, though, you medical people are just too careful.
