==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Guan Hong:''' *sigh* Life is truly short...
:{{DIcon}} Is everything alright?
::'''Guan Hong:''' I'm fine, it's just that I was diagnosed with an incurable illness a while back. I was told that I didn't have long...
::'''Guan Hong:''' So I asked myself, what have I done my entire life?
::'''Guan Hong:''' I've worked hard, sacrificing my health, and what did I earn for it? A pile of things I wasn't born with, and can't take with me when I die.
::'''Guan Hong:''' Looking back, I didn't even one thing that I could be proud of in all those decades. Ha...
::'''Guan Hong:''' It's a shame that I realized it so late.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it.
::'''Guan Hong:''' Yes, thank you. I need some time alone.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Guan Hong:''' Hahaha, are you here to have fun too?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Guan Hong:''' What am I doing? I'm enjoying life!
::'''Guan Hong:''' I always thought that work was the most important thing. I slept little, ate little &mdash; got myself neither a wife nor kids!
::'''Guan Hong:''' ...At least, that was until Dr. [[Baizhu]] told me I was a goner a little while back. That's when I figured it out! What work? What career? It's all hogwash!
::'''Guan Hong:''' Good thing all the money I've saved in my earlier years is more than enough for me to wine and dine myself to death here at the Pearl Galley.
::'''Guan Hong:''' ...Actually, when I put it like that, things aren't so bad! Hahaha!
:{{DIcon}} See you around, then.
::'''Guan Hong:''' Hey now, don't be so quick to leave...
