==Trivia==
* In some localizations other than English, this NPC's name includes the number thirty-three. This is explained within her dialogue after the player wins against her once. She supplies bonsai and rock gardens for sale at {{lang|[[Tsukumomono Groceries]]|ja=九十九物|ja_rm=Tsukumo-butsu|ja_lit=Ninety-Nine Things}}, and [[Aoi]] has said that her goods could be "worth a third of many precious treasures." Thirty-three is equal to a third of ninety-nine, creating a play on words based on the store's name.
