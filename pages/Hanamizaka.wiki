{{Description|The outskirts of Inazuma City exude a time-worn and leisurely atmosphere as you make your way up the old paths. It seems that the prosperity of the city has not influenced the scenery here. The power and grace of the [[Ei|Shogun]] can also be observed here, bringing a quiet and different kind of vitality.|[[Archive]]}}
