'''Araji''' is an historical figure of the Aranara. They, along with [[Arayama]] and [[Aramaha]], sealed each of the three [[Ashvattha's Concourses]] with their own rhythms, and then turned themselves into [[Vasara Tree]]s. Araji's Vasara Tree is located at [[Gandha Hill]], [[Avidya Forest]].

==Story==
Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama's friendship was comparable to the friendship of the three God-Kings: [[King Deshret]], the [[Goddess of Flowers]], and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Sapwood Blade}}</ref> Araji was also a great friend of [[Arayasa]].<ref name="Gloomy Path">{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path}}</ref>

Araji was described as "a timid friend who liked to hide in quiet places and sing softly".<ref name="Gloomy Path"/> Their rhythm is '''"Rhythm of the Gloomy Path,"''' which is able to open [[Gloomy Path]], lead to secret sites.<ref>Tutorial: [[Tutorial/Rhythm of the Gloomy Path|Rhythm of the Gloomy Path]]</ref>

Presumably during the [[Cataclysm]], Araji fought again the [[Marana]]. Afterward, they turned into a [[Vasara Tree]] inside a sealed Ashvattha's Concourse, and left their song behind as a method to unseal it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Encounter in the Woods|note=children quests}}</ref>
