'''Araji''' is an [[Aranara]] historical figure from five hundred years ago. Araji, [[Arayama]], and [[Aramaha]] sealed each of the three [[Ashvattha's Concourses]] with their own rhythms, and then turned themselves into [[Vasara Tree]]s. Araji's Vasara Tree is located at [[Gandha Hill]], [[Avidya Forest]].

His rhythm, "Rhythm of the Gloomy Path," opens [[Gloomy Path]]s which lead to secret sites.<ref>Tutorial: [[Tutorial/Rhythm of the Gloomy Path|Rhythm of the Gloomy Path]]</ref>

==Profile==
Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama's friendship was comparable to the friendship of the three God-Kings: [[King Deshret]], the [[Goddess of Flowers]], and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Sapwood Blade}}</ref> Araji was also a great friend of [[Arayasa]]'s, who describes him as a "timid friend who liked to hide in quiet places and sing softly."<ref name="Gloomy Path">{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path}}</ref>

Before the Aranara abandoned [[Old Vanarana]], Araji wrote the second Inscription of Remembrance in his house. 

Araji was familiar with the [[Traveler's Sibling]], who assisted the Aranara during the [[cataclysm]], and "picked up a thing or two" from them.<ref>Gadget: Aranyaka, [[Aranyaka (Gadget)#VI: Someone's Message|VI: Someone's Message]]</ref> It was presumably also around this time that Araji fought against [[Marana]] and transformed into a Vasara Tree, leaving behind his song as a method to unseal the Ashvattha's Concourse.<ref name="Gloomy Path" />
