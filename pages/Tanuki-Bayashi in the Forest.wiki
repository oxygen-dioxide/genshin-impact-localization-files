==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You learn that an old friend of Hanachirusato's can be found in Chinju Forest. Perhaps they might be able to help out with the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual. But while in the forest, you hear a strange shout.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon entering Chinju Forest)
:'''Strange Voice:''' Hello—! Hello—! Is anyone there—?
:'''Strange Voice:''' Oh, why do I bother? There's no one at hand, and were anyone here, they wouldn't understand a thing I said.
:'''Strange Voice:''' Blast [[Kamuna Harunosuke|that dratted fellow]]... Oh, I'm so bored...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Sounds like someone's calling out. Is it "that old friend"?

;(Search the marked area for the strange voice)
:'''Strange Voice:''' Mm? This scent... leaves and fresh soil...
:'''Strange Voice:''' Well, I never! Someone of mine own race whom I know not!
:'''Strange Voice:''' Over here! Over here, quickly&mdash;!

;(If the Sky Kitsune Statue is visited)<!-- this dialogue can be triggered as late as after speaking to Ioroi for the first time (and the dialogue itself has no changes); not sure at what point this dialogue can no longer be triggered -->
:'''Paimon:''' The Sky Kitsune Statue that was supposed to protect the ward... It's empty inside.
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe it was hidden by [[Hanachirusato|Miss Mask]]'s old friend. Let's go find out!
:{{DIcon}} "Miss Mask," Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon just came up with that nickname. How is it? Easier to remember, right?
:{{DIcon}} Not at all.
:{{DIcon}} It makes no sense.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, forget it then... Anyway, let's find some clues first!

;(Continue searching for the source of the strange voice)
:'''Strange Voice:''' Hello&mdash;! Hello&mdash;! Can you hear me?
:'''Strange Voice:''' You're on the right path! Forward, and step lively!

;(When near the strange statue)
:'''Strange Voice:''' You're almost there! Do you see a statue of a majestic tanuki?
:'''Strange Voice:''' Ah, it has been many years since I have met such a fellow tanuki of such might. Well met!

;(Upon approaching the strange statue)
:'''Strange Voice:''' Wait, this smell...
:'''Strange Voice:''' Eh!? A human! Where did you come from? Come to mine aid, fellow gentlechurls!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, what's going on?

;(Upon defeating the hilichurls near the strange statue)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's those hilichurls beaten off. Let's have a look at that big tanuki statue.
----
;(Talk to Ioroi)
:'''Ioroi:''' Eek! I&mdash;I... Mine name is Ioroi. Do whatever you want! K&mdash;Kill me if that be your will!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, the statue is talking! And it's so scared that it can barely string a sentence together!
:'''Ioroi:''' I am no statue! This unseemly appearance is but the work of a temporary seal! Mine name is Ioroi, the world-renowned bake-danuki!
:{{DIcon}} Ioroi?
:{{DIcon}} World-renowned?
:'''Ioroi:''' What? Are you telling me that folk nowadays have heard naught of Ioroi?
:'''Ioroi:''' The "Tanuki Gyouen Scroll," "Ioroi's Teapot," "Kakushigami Oobayashi," "Yougou Tanuki Gassen"... Of these tales have you heard nothing?
:'''Ioroi:''' Ah, how long has mine seal persisted...
:{{DIcon}} I mean you no harm...
::'''Ioroi:''' What? You aren't here to destroy me? Come now, why did you not say so earlier, then?
:{{DIcon}} I am here to collect a debt.
::'''Ioroi:''' Uh, collect a debt? Where? When was that? Let me think, let me think...
::'''Ioroi:''' You, uh... What do I owe you, again?
::'''Paimon:''' He's thinking really hard...
::'''Paimon:''' You probably shouldn't tell this sort of joke in front of strangers.
::'''Ioroi:''' That's right, jest not so!
::'''Ioroi:''' Mm, it's all good, it's all good... Actually, best I make sure. Do I really owe you nothing?
::'''Paimon:''' ...Do you really owe that many debts?
:'''Ioroi:''' *cough* Ahem. Well then, speak! Why have you come seeking me, the lord of bake-danuki?
:{{DIcon}} This is about the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual...
::'''Ioroi:''' The Sacred Secular what now? What is that? Some manner of oni treasure?
::{{DIcon}} This guy is unbelievable...
:{{DIcon}} I'm looking for wards here...
::'''Ioroi:''' Warts? Are those edible? We bake-danuki do know quite a bit about cooking.
::'''Paimon:''' No, it's the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual!
::'''Ioroi:''' Victuals? Oh, it's been too long since I've had any victuals...
::{{DIcon}} This guy is unbelievable...
:'''Paimon:''' *sigh* Is he really Miss Masked Maiden's old friend?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, we're looking for something hidden inside a kitsune statue.
:'''Ioroi:''' Eek... Uh, Wh&mdash;Why are you l&mdash;looking for that, might I ask?
:{{DIcon}} Ah.
:{{DIcon}} Now we're getting somewhere.
:'''Ioroi:''' Ugh, it's on that comb's account that I was sealed in here for...
:'''Ioroi:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} One hundred years?
:{{DIcon}} One thousand years?
:{{DIcon}} One million years?
:'''Ioroi:''' I don't know how long it's been! Sunlight [[Weather#Unique Environmental Shifts|doesn't come through]] the Chinju Forest. There's no way to tell time!
:'''Ioroi:''' Back then, I wreaked havoc everywhere to lure [[Kitsune Saiguu|that sneaky kitsune]] out, but it was all in vain.
:'''Ioroi:''' Eventually, I decided to vent my anger by dismantling one of those kitsune statues, and I found a comb inside... Which gave me an idea!
:'''Ioroi:''' The comb was hidden inside a kitsune statue and even had the Hakushin symbol on it, which reminded me of her white fur...
:'''Ioroi:''' Thus, I concluded immediately that it must be very important. In which case, I just needed to hide the comb, and that sneaky kitsune would surely come out!
:'''Paimon:''' Yup, treasure's a good way to lure people out for sure! Then what happened?
:'''Ioroi:''' Then came one of the humans from the [[Yougou Three]]. He defeated my tribe and I, turning all of us to stone.
:'''Paimon:''' So that's why Ioroi is afraid of humans...
:'''Ioroi:''' Hmph! Humans. They're so short-lived, and they can't even transform... I don't get why that kitsune likes them so much.
:'''Ioroi:''' That guy who sealed me up was especially infuriating. He even told me to "strike a nice pose so that I can become nice scenery." Why, that little&mdash;!
:{{DIcon}} Well, you do make for nice scenery...
:'''Ioroi:''' Eh? You... How could you...
:'''Paimon:''' (Hey, (Traveler), don't annoy him, or we may never get that ward...)
:{{DIcon}} I mean to say that you look really bold and burly...
:{{DIcon}} I mean that you are truly handsome and truly...
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! You make this dark forest look so much more colorful!
:'''Ioroi:''' ...
:'''Ioroi:''' And?
:{{DIcon}} Like the statue of a god...
:{{DIcon}} Even the Statues of The Seven pale in comparison...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, so, being sealed up is not such a bad thing after all, eh? See, humans don't mean you any harm!
:'''Ioroi:''' I reckon I can see where you're going, but at the same time... I also... don't?
:{{DIcon}} Could we borrow that comb you spoke of?
:'''Ioroi:''' Well, you certainly could... But only if you play with the children first.
:'''Paimon:''' Sure, that's easy. (Traveler) is good with kids!
:{{DIcon}} Am I really...
:{{DIcon}} That's right, I play with Paimon all the time.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey!
:'''Ioroi:''' [[Shousei]], [[Gyoubu Koban]], and [[Kichiboushi]]. Go find these {{Color|buzz|three little tanuki}} and play with them. I would do it, but as you can see, I'm not exactly at any liberty to move.
:'''Ioroi:''' That dratted fellow was a bit sloppy when he sealed them. That's why some of them were able to get out earlier.
:'''Ioroi:''' ...Wait, that's not correct! We should say, rather, that we bake-danuki are most powerful indeed. It's only normal, therefore, that we could free ourselves from a mere human seal!
:{{DIcon}} Well, what about you then...
::'''Paimon:''' Ahem! You speak truth, Ioroi the mighty and powerful!
:{{DIcon}} Indeed, most powerful!
:'''Ioroi:''' Although their power can't really compare to mine, they can still use it to hide themselves.
:'''Ioroi:''' Alright then, off you go.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|The ward of the Chinju Forest is indeed in the hands of bake-danuki Ioroi, and Ioroi is willing to give it up. But he will only do so after you have found and played with the three little bake-danuki: Shousei, Gyoubu Koban, and Kichiboushi...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Ioroi again)
:'''Ioroi:''' Ooh... I do so wish to scratch mine belly...
:'''Ioroi:''' Mm? You're back already? Go on, help me find Shousei, Gyoubu Koban, and Kichiboushi, and go {{Color|buzz|play with them}}.
:'''Ioroi:''' Alright then, off you go.
----
;(Play with Shousei) <!-- Paimon's dialogue for Shousei differs depending on if you find it first or second, and Paimon has no dialogue if Shousei is found third -->
;(If Shousei is found first)
::'''Paimon:''' Yikes, that looks like a... really strange tanuki!
::'''Paimon:''' Come on, (Traveler), let's go!
;(If Shousei is found second)
::'''Paimon:''' Ah, there's another tanuki!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, aren't they good at hide-and-seek?
;(Follow Shousei and light the torch)
:'''"Shousei":''' Mm!

;(Find Kichiboushi) <!-- Dialogue for Kichiboushi is the same regardless if you find it first or second; probably the same if you find it third -->
:'''Paimon:''' Those hilichurls seem to have something against that wooden barrel...
;(Destroy the barrel and investigate the spot)
:'''"Kichiboushi":''' Mm!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? There's a little tanuki here too...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, whatever the case, this should be one of Ioroi's quests, right?

;(Play with Gyoubu Koban) <!-- Dialogue for Gyoubu Koban differs depending on if you find it second or third (cannot be found first) -->
;(If Gyoubu Koban is found second)
::'''Paimon:''' Ah, there's another tanuki!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, aren't they good at hide-and-seek?
;(If Gyoubu Koban is found third)
::'''Paimon:''' Finally, that's the last one...
::'''Paimon:''' Playing with them is so... tiring...
;(Follow Gyoubu Koban and light the correct torch)
:'''"Gyoubu Koban":''' Mm!
----
;(Report back to Ioroi after playing)
:'''Ioroi:''' Hehe, well done! They seem to be quite happy.
:'''Ioroi:''' ...Huh? Oh, no problem. Let me ask them for you.
:'''Ioroi:''' Gyoubu Koban was asking, "If you are humans, why do you smell like tanuki?"
:'''Ioroi:''' ...Actually, that's right! I demand an explanation! Why *do* you smell like tanuki?
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? You're only asking this now...
:{{DIcon}} It was the masked shrine maiden...
:{{DIcon}} We ate some strange stuff...
:'''Paimon:''' Right! That's what happened!
:'''Paimon:''' Miss Masked Maiden cooked us a very lavish meal earlier, and she said that she used magic she secretly learned from the bake-danuki to make it.
:'''Ioroi:''' What? She learned our magic in secret? How dare she...
:'''Ioroi''': Hmm... Could it be...
:'''Ioroi:''' Oh, come on. That sneaky kitsune! If she was still alive, she could at least have come over to say hello, right?
:'''Paimon:''' She's a shrine maiden with a mask, and she called you an "old friend."
:'''Ioroi:''' Mask? I don't know anyone with a mask. Don't know any shrine maidens, either. I sure do know a kitsune, though.
:'''Ioroi:''' ...That said, that sneaky kitsune did appear in the form of a shrine maiden before. What does the shrine maiden you speak of look like?
:'''Paimon:''' She wears a white fox mask...
:'''Ioroi:''' Anything else?
:{{DIcon}} She had short black hair.
::'''Paimon:''' And she wore a shrine maiden outfit.
:{{DIcon}} She was dressed as a shrine maiden.
::'''Paimon:''' And she had short black hair!
:'''Ioroi:''' Hmm... Don't know her. Never seen anyone like that in mine life!
:'''Paimon:''' Is that so...
:'''Ioroi:''' ...Mm? Yeah, sure, leave it to me.
:'''Ioroi:''' Shousei said, "It was fun playing with you. Thanks!"
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon had a lot of fun too!
:{{DIcon}} So, about that comb...
:'''Ioroi:''' Now, now &mdash; I am the world renowned bake-danuki Ioroi, and I will surely keep my word. You may have the comb.
:'''Ioroi:''' But what do you plan to do with the comb, anyway? It probably still smells like kitsune.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, here's what happened...

:'''You tell Ioroi about the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual...'''

:'''Ioroi:''' What? I didn't realize that it was so important. You should've said so earlier...
:'''Ioroi:''' Agh, I was sealed over this thing for...
:{{DIcon}} One hundred years?
:{{DIcon}} One thousand years?
:{{DIcon}} One million years?
:'''Ioroi:''' Ugh! Stop speaking so lightly of my misfortunes!
:'''Ioroi:''' Never mind. It's all water under the bridge now. I do also have some inkling about the barrier near the forest.
:'''Ioroi:''' Back when I was fighting that sneaky kitsune, I once saw it on the eastern seashore. It looks like a Thunder Sakura with a torii gate, right?
:'''Ioroi:''' Back when that guy was battling the demons or whatever, I was worried that some of them might come out to hurt us. So I used magic to put a seal on that place.
:'''Ioroi:''' Let me see. The seal should be under the cliff face to the east... Kichiboushi, take them there and remove the seal.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Ioroi.
:'''Ioroi:''' Alright, alright. Enough jibber-jabber. Go now.
:'''Ioroi:''' If you run into that sneaky kitsune, remember to send her my regards. Just say... let me think...
:'''Ioroi:''' "You've ticked me off real good this time, you jerk. Come back and fight me &mdash; our contest isn't over yet! And help me break this seal while you're at it, would you? It's not as if I couldn't do it myself or anything, but you still owe me a favor! Also, Gyoubu Koban says he misses you!"
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, whoa, that's a lot to remember!
;(Obtain [[Ioroi's Ward]])
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|Even though you have obtained the ward from Ioroi, the barrier seems to be hidden by mystical bake-danuki arts. Once you destroy the barrier, you will be one step closer to completing the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual.}}<!-- assumed to change here -->
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Speak to Ioroi again)
:'''Ioroi:''' What? Weren't you off to enjoy your Sacred Secular Steaming Victuals or whatever?
:'''Ioroi:''' Go now. If you run into that sneaky kitsune, remember to send her my regards.
----
;(Arrive at the bottom of the cliff face to the east)
:'''Paimon:''' This is it? It's just a bunch of bare stones...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? He seems to be using some kind of magic to...
;(The nearby rocks fade and disappear)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! The stones disappeared!
:{{DIcon}} That's amazing.
:{{DIcon}} That's kinda spooky.
:'''Paimon:''' So this is bake-danuki magic? Seems kinda fun!
:'''Paimon:''' Thank you, Kichiboushi! Let's play Hide-and-Seek next time.
:'''"Kichiboushi":''' Mm!

;(Approach the barrier)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, time to dispel that barrier. Are you ready, (Traveler)?

;(Upon solving the puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' It's here! The "Ochimusha" evil spirit thing that the masked shrine maiden talked about!
:'''Paimon:''' Take him down, (Traveler)!

;(Upon defeating the Ochimusha)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That was well done &mdash; whether it was dealing with Ioroi's illusory tricks, or the way you defeated those demons.
:'''Paimon:''' "Eek!"
:'''Paimon:''' Or so Paimon might have said, but this trick of yours is getting real old, Miss Masked Maiden.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Ah, so I disappointed you, then? I apologize. I'll do better next time.
:{{DIcon}} There's no need to "do better" at trivial things like this...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That is true. So, as for Ioroi... Is he doing well?
:{{DIcon}} He's very spry, alright...
::'''Paimon:''' Even though he's been turned into stone.
:{{DIcon}} He was turned into stone...
::'''Paimon:''' But he's very well!

:'''You recount the events in Chinju Forest...'''

:'''Hanachirusato:''' I see...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Usually, when bake-danuki make a mess, we won't send anyone to deal with them as long as they don't cross the line. After all, although they are mischievous, they're kind-hearted and simple, just like children.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But when Ioroi dared to steal the ward for the Cleansing Ritual, well, that was enough to get him punished. Since the "Yougou Three" were mentioned in your story, then it was probably [[Kamuna Harunosuke|Kamuna]]... an onmyouji from a past age, who did the deed.
:{{DIcon}} He also mentioned a "sneaky kitsune"...
:{{DIcon}} Your kitsune mask...
:'''Paimon:''' Miss Masked Maiden, are you Ioroi's kitsune friend?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...That's quite the compliment. He was actually talking about the daughter of the Hakushin bloodline, also known as the "Kitsune Saiguu." She was worshiped as the kitsune goddess in many places long ago.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The [[Sky Kitsune]] and [[Earth Kitsune]] were once her emissaries. After she left, they all turned into stone statues to preserve their power and await her return &mdash; and when she does, they will all walk the [[Byakko Plain]] together once more.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Following her departure, the bloodline and mystical might of the kitsune on [[Narukami Island]] today have dwindled to less than one tenth of what they used to be...
:{{DIcon}} Ioroi said "Our contest isn't over yet!"
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Oh, that. This is what happened. Did you know that Ioroi's full name is "Ioroi, the Hidden Protector of the Grove?"
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Ioroi may be dull and impish, but he is also kind and loyal. That's why the Kitsune Saiguu aimed to guide him to the right path a long time ago.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' In order to make sure that he would comply with the [[Electro Archon]]'s rule, the Kitsune Saiguu set the two of them up and got Ioroi appointed as the Protector of the Grove. This made him responsible for the safety of the Chinju Forest.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That's why, when [[cataclysm|the world became pitch black]], the Kitsune Saiguu was worried that Ioroi might die while fighting against this inexorable evil in his capacity as protector of the forest.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' So she used a game of Hide-and-Seek, something the bake-danuki are good at, as a way to challenge him...

:'''"Hmph, foolish kitsune. I shall not lose to you in a game of Hide-and-Seek."'''
:'''"Is that so? Well, go on then. Go and hide."'''
:'''"Chinju Forest is my home turf. You will never find me here."'''
:'''"I don't believe you. Now, make sure you find yourself a good spot to hide. Do not get found..."'''<!-- this is all white text on 1 black screen -->

:'''Hanachirusato:''' "Ioroi, whatever happens... they're all my magical tricks. Don't fall for them and don't show up," she said.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "Of course, you sneaky kitsune. I will definitely defeat you this time," said Ioroi. And that's how their endless contest began.
:'''Paimon:''' ...So Ioroi is still waiting for her to come back and find him?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Based on what you said about Ioroi, that appears to be the case...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But after a while, Ioroi sensed that something was wrong and started wreaking havoc. He even stole the ward in an attempt to lure the Kitsune Saiguu out.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' He didn't realize that it was something required for the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual. He just thought that it was a comb of some importance to the Kitsune Saiguu. Later on, Kamuna sealed him into stone due to that misstep.
:{{DIcon}} What about the Kitsune Saiguu, then?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...She was swallowed up by the darkness. In the end, after that darkness was defeated, she returned to the great land of Narukami along with the soil.
:{{DIcon}} And who are you then?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Me? As you can see, I am just "Hanachirusato." A shrine maiden who wants to borrow your strength to destroy these evils.
:{{DIcon}} That wasn't my question...
:'''Paimon:''' Miss Masked... Hanachirusato, it's really strange that you know so many things about the past that most people don't.
:'''Paimon:''' You even know how to use bake-danuki magic and cook tanuki dishes.
:{{DIcon}} But you don't know much about the present.
:'''Paimon:''' It's almost like you're someone from a few centuries ago...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' We also saw someone who looked like you in some memories. She even had the same name as you...
:{{DIcon}} So...
:'''Paimon:''' You must be just like Ioroi, a bake-danuki who was sealed several centuries ago!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' N&mdash;No, that's not who I...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I inherited her memories. As for other things, please forgive me. I cannot speak of them yet.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I made you a promise, back there in the cave. So when the time comes, I will reveal everything.
:'''Paimon:''' What do we do, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} I believe her.
:{{DIcon}} Let's leave it at that.
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, if you say so, Paimon will have some faith in Miss Masked Maiden too!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Thank you for your understanding.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Now, we must part here for the time being.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "We part in body alone, for our hearts drift with the clouds."
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I will pray for your success beneath the well in [[Konda Village]]. I shall be next to the Thunder Sakura root that you cleansed successfully.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' When the tree roots at all five places have been cleansed, please look for me there.

==Trivia==
*The quest name may be a Japanese pun. Whereas the actual Japanese version uses the wording {{lang|''Shinrin no Tanuki-Bayashi''|ja=深林の狸囃子|ja_tl=Tanuki-Bayashi in the Deep Forest}}, it could be worded as {{lang|''Fukai Hayashi no Tanuki no Hayashi''|ja=深い林の狸の囃子}} with the same meaning and kanji, where the first ''hayashi'' (林) means "woods," while the second ''{{w|Hayashi (music)|hayashi}}'' (囃子) refers to a type of traditional Japanese music.
*{{w|Tanuki-bayashi}} (lit. "tanuki's hayashi (music)") refers to strange loud sounds heard in the middle of night. In the Japanese folklore, it is believed to be played by an orchestra of tanukis.
