|text    = Today, I walked alone on the beaches of the [[Guyun Stone Forest]] and picked up several [[Starconch]]es along the way.

I heard that they contain secrets and can be used to send messages. But when I put them to my ear, I heard no voice, just the hollow sound of the wind.

No matter.

The wrath of evil spirits, omens of calamity... and your voice. That's all I need to hear.

When you're free, come talk to me about what you've heard from the Starconches.
