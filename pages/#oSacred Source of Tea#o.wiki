|description    = A type of tea tree with green leaves that can be found in [[Qiaoying Village]]. The [[Chenyu Adeptea]] of the Vale, renowned throughout [[Teyvat]], is largely harvested from this species.<br>It is said that tea trees have very stringent requirements for their healthy growth. [[Amurta]] researchers have tried many times to transplant them to [[Sumeru]], but they have all failed due to lacking suitable water and soil. Fortunately, this is no trouble at all for a Realm Within that can nourish all things.
