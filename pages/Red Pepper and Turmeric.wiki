==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Xiangling's bangs are swept to one side by a golden hairclip with a paw motif, and the rest of her hair is braided in a looped bow-like updo at the back of her head resembling panda ears when viewed from the front, fastened with a small orange ribbon.

Xiangling wears a black leotard with a golden overcoat, resembling a qipao dress, which is decorated with tangerine-colored ribbons in the front and back, and the back being larger, holding a bell. She wears a gold belt, which she uses to hold her {{Pyro}} [[Vision]] and carry around her red panda companion, [[Guoba]]. Additionally, she wears brown fingerless gloves and boots, as well as a braided red garter belt around her left thigh and right arm and adhesive bandages crossed in an X on her right knee.
