===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Puca:''' Ah, hello! How are things? Is there anything you'd like to know about the ores? You can ask me anything!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your ores...
::'''Puca:''' Yup, I've got all sorts of pretty ores with me. Whatever you want, I might just have it here!
::'''Puca:''' Most of them are ordinary, not like those previous gems my big sister has...
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about the ores' uses?
::'''Puca:''' Hmm, I've never thought about that before... I only collect stones because they're pretty...
::'''Puca:''' Honestly, I think it's funny how people from outside find these ores useful.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Puca:''' Seeya! If you do find pretty stones, be sure to tell me about it!

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Puca:''' Ah, hello! How are things? Is there anything you'd like to know about the ores? You can ask me anything!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your ores...
::'''Puca:''' Yup, I've got all sorts of pretty ores with me. Whatever you want, I might just have it here!
::'''Puca:''' Most of them are pretty ordinary, but even normal ones must have their own awesome uses, right?
:{{DIcon}} How's the situation with the clocks?
::'''Puca:''' According to Mr. [[Chesil]], he'll soon be able to make new, beautiful clocks.
::'''Puca:''' He even took me on a tour of the place where they process the stones. The pretty stones were cut up into tiny, tiny pieces...
::'''Puca:''' I didn't quite get what was going on, but Mr. Chesil said that those stones will turn into the hearts of those clocks...
::'''Puca:''' Him saying that made me so happy, too.
::'''Puca:''' But he says that he's going to exchange more Mora for more stones...
::'''Puca:''' Mora is very shiny, but every coin looks the same &mdash; I don't wanna exchange my stones for those.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Puca:''' Seeya! If you do find pretty stones, be sure to tell me about it!
