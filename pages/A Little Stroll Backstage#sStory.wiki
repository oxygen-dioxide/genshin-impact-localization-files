{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Begin event)
:'''Paimon''': There's so much going on at the [[Fontinalia Film Festival]]! Look, there's a stall over there that we haven't been to yet...
:'''Paimon''': Traveler, come and see this! There are loads of props set out over here, they look like they're all based on common Fontainian themes...
:(The two of them take a closer look at the props, which are finely-crafted and extremely life-like...)
:'''Traveler''': Hmm... I'd guess that the Film Association has put these here so more people can experience the joy of filmmaking. Look, there are Kameras here too.
:'''Paimon''': Wow! So can we use these props to design some scenes of our own? We can use them to commemorate our travels through Fontaine, and even invite our friends to come admire them!
:'''Traveler''': Sounds like Paimon can't wait to try it out! How about... Paimon decides the theme, and I take charge of the set design?
:'''Paimon''': Yay! Paimon's head is bubbling with ideas! Ooohh, it's so hard to contain the overflowing inspiration. Let's get started already!
----
;(Set up Stage 01)
:'''Paimon''': There's an Ousia Block in the scene. Why don't we see what happens if we put this Automaton next to it?

;(Place the [[Recon Log Mek]])
:'''Paimon''': Whoa, it seems like we can trigger a certain effect by placing the Performance Prop here!
:'''Paimon''': You can decide where to put the other Performance Prop~

;(Place the [[Water Volume Detection Crystal]])
:;(If the Water Volume Detection Crystal was not placed on the yellow tile)
::'''Paimon''': Not bad... But maybe it would look even better somewhere else?
:'''Paimon''': Continue setting up the scene however you want! It'll be exciting to see how it turns out~
