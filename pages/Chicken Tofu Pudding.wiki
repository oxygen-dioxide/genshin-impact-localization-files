|description     = A dish made with great precision.
|desc_suspicious = The base soup is far too salty and the mouthfeel of the chicken tofu pudding is insufficiently fine. This technical lack has caused this dish to merely have the form and not the power.
|desc_basic      = The finely-diced chicken breast is stirred strongly and added into a soup that has various other minced meats within, before being cooked over a small flame. The result is light and elegant, and it tastes like tofu pudding. The meat has been shaped such that it is "a chicken above chickens, yet does not look like chicken." This, too, is part of Liyue's culinary fine arts.
|desc_delicious  = Shaped like a single block that does not scatter, it truly looks like tofu pudding. Its exquisite tenderness unravels on the tongue the moment it is scooped up with a porcelain spoon and fed into the mouth, with a freshness so intense that it could carry your spirit from your mortal shell following in hot pursuit. What lies before you is not a dish, but a gentle freeze, a pure spring, a stroke of the divine.
