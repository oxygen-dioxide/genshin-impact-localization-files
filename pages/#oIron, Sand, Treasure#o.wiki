|description    = A weapon rack placed in front of the Blacksmith with three different kinds of swords displayed, all of which are quality weapons for an ordinary mercenary. Apart from basic combat performance, a weapon's potential to withstand damage in the desert and its maintenance efficiency are both factors that mercenaries take into consideration. Only when the merits-to-price ratio of a weapon reaches their desired level will a mercenary make the purchase.
