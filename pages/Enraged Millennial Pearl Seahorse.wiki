{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Millennial Pearl Seahorse

|name_1      = Xenomare Pearl
|desc_1      = The Millennial Pearl Seahorse holds a Xenomare Pearl in front of its legs that grants it 135% [[RES]] increase to all DMG and enables it to use stronger attacks. The pearl is {{Electro}}-infused and can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reaction]]s. When the pearl is destroyed, the Millennial Pearl Seahorse will become paralyzed for a period of time.

|name_2      = Earthshock Descent
|desc_2      = Leaps twice into the air before slamming down at the player's location, dealing '''95% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}, then raises its front legs to cause another shockwave, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and leaving the ground electrified. Electrified ground deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} every 0.5s to players standing on it. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.

|name_3      = Lock On
|desc_3      = Marks the player with a circle of swimming fish, and additionally creates 4 more circles around the player's location. The locked-on circle will erupt after a delay, while the 4 additional circles stay on the field and only erupt when the player comes in contact. An eruption deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and leaving the affected areas electrified. Electrified ground deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} every 0.5s to players standing on it. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.
|file_3      = Millennial Pearl Seahorse Lock On 2

|name_4      = Unihorn Thrust
|desc_4      = Charges at the player, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and electrifying the ground in its path. Electrified ground deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} every 0.5s to players standing on it. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.

|name_5      = Fintide Assault
|desc_5      = Consecutively sends 3 schools of fish to attack the player, each dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. Then, immediately follows with '''Unihorn Thrust'''.

|name_6      = Fintide Barrage
|desc_6      = Conjures a great number of fish-shaped missiles which home in at the player, each dealing '''35% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on hit. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.

|name_7      = Tail Swipe
|desc_7      = Performs a 3-part melee attacks by swiping its tail, dealing '''60% ATK''', '''60% ATK''', '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. If the second hit hits the player, the third hit's DMG will be halved. The first hit of the combo can sometimes be omitted. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.

|name_8      = Fontemer Hoarthunder
|desc_8      = After the Xenomare Pearl's durability is decreased below 7GU (or 4.2GU if the pearl has already been destroyed once), the Millennial Pearl Seahorse ascends high into the air and summons 4 Resonant Coral Orbs that move clockwise around the arena. The seahorse absorbs energy from the Resonant Coral Orbs and summons a total of 6 lightning strikes that strike over a large area, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and electrifying the struck ground. Electrified ground deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} every 0.5s to characters standing on it. The Resonant Coral Orbs are {{Electro}}-infused objects and can be destroyed using Elemental Reactions. Destroying an orb will slightly reduce the durability of the Xenomare Pearl, and destroying all four will immediately destroy it. If all orbs are not destroyed in time, the Xenomare Pearl will recover durability based on the amount of orbs left on the field. This ability can only be used once per fight.

A pearl recovered this way will only have '''60%''' of its original durability.
