{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hakau:''' Who knew it'd be so hard to live so high up day after day...
:'''Hakau:''' I wonder how it would feel like to get swung back and forth by a Yumkasaur.
:{{DIcon}} Pretty great, huh?
::'''Hakau:''' Oh, you mean the pleasure of coming and going freely?
::'''Hakau:''' Hmm... Do you think floating in the air is kind of like swimming in water?
::'''Hakau:''' Then I can kind of understand.
:{{DIcon}} Pretty grating, huh?
::'''Hakau:''' Really? Then aren't the Scions of the Canopy always like... engaging in spiritual practices every day?
::'''Hakau:''' Oh... No wonder their warriors are so strong... Much better than us People of the Springs, who only know some cheap lava tricks...
:{{DIcon}} Why not try it yourself?
::'''Hakau:''' You've got a point.
