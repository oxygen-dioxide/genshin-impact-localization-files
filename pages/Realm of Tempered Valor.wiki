|image1   = Tutorial Realm of Tempered Valor 1.png
|text1    = Every challenge in the "Realm of Tempered Valor" event comprises 25 floors' worth of combat stages. The Level and HP of opponents within each challenge will increase as you ascend from floor to floor. Finish a stage within 30s to clear it and continue to challenge the next one.
|image2   = Tutorial Realm of Tempered Valor 2.png
|text2    = If you cannot complete a stage within 30s, you cannot challenge the next stage. After you exit the challenge, your results will be based on the highest floor you reached and the time spent completing it.
|image3   = Tutorial Realm of Tempered Valor 3.png
|text3    = If you have 12/16/20/23/25 seconds or more remaining when clearing a floor, you can skip 1/2/3/4/5 floors and immediately challenge a higher-level floor. When you reach Floor 14/15/16/17/22, the number of floors you can skip will decrease to 4/3/2/1/0.

If more than one of your Friends meets these requirements, the Boon will be randomly provided by 1 of them. If, after you grant a Boon to a Friend, they achieve their best record yet, your Friend Record will display the boon's symbol.<br>Boon of Friendship: All party members' Max HP +25%, ATK +25%, DEF +25%, Elemental Mastery +200.
