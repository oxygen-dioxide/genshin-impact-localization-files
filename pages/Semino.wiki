{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Semino:''' Music is the language of the soul.
:'''Semino:''' ...Mm, communicating is tough, but I'm sure the [[Wayob]] can see things my way.
:{{DIcon}} Is there a language barrier of sorts?
::'''Semino:''' Ah... Well, communicating across languages requires a little more time and effort, yeah.
::'''Semino:''' After all, each instrument has its own character.
::'''Semino:''' Calm, mellow, lively, and those that love to steal the show. Finding a stage where they can coexist in harmony is tough stuff.
::'''Semino:''' The [[Iridescence Tour]] is what's got my eye right now. If I had a chance to talk with the organizers, I'm sure we'd have a fruitful time!
:{{DIcon}} I'll help you ask the Wayob when I get the chance.
::'''Semino:''' Really, you'd do that for me? There's no need. I was just kidding!
