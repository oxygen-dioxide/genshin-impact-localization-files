'''The Eremites''' are an enemy group.

As with all [[Other Human Factions]], Eremites have -20% resistance against [[DMG Bonus/Physical|Physical Damage]].

==Types==
===Low-Tier===
The weakest and most common type of Eremites who mostly deal {{Color|Physical DMG}}. They are usually found in groups of similar-ranked Eremites or led by a higher-ranked Eremite.
*{{Enemy|Eremite Axe Vanguard}} &mdash; Armed with axes
*{{Enemy|Eremite Crossbow}} &mdash; They fire bolts, which can either deal Physical or {{Dendro}} damage
*{{Enemy|Eremite Ravenbeak Halberdier}} &mdash; Armed with halberds
*{{Enemy|Eremite Linebreaker}} &mdash; Armed with rounded katars
*{{Enemy|Eremite Sword-Dancer}} &mdash; Armed with a curved sword

===Mid-Tier===
A stronger type of Eremite who deals elemental DMG and can enter a state which increases their offense and respective elemental resistance for a short duration. These Eremites are usually found with lower-ranking Eremites, but can sometimes be found alone or with higher-ranked Eremites.
*{{Enemy|Eremite Daythunder}} &mdash; Uses an {{Electro}}-infused axe
*{{Enemy|Eremite Sunfrost}} &mdash; Dual-wields two {{Cryo}}-infused blades
*{{Enemy|Eremite Desert Clearwater}} &mdash; Uses {{Hydro}}-infused katars

===High-Tier===
The strongest type of Eremites, capable of dealing elemental DMG and summoning [[Spirits of Omen]] to assist them in battle, putting them in an enhanced state with increased offense and defensive capabilities while the spirit is active. Eliminating the spirit will significantly injure the Eremite along with lowering their resistances and stunning them for a long duration. These Eremites are often found alone, though sometimes with lower-ranked Eremites.
*{{Enemy|Eremite Stone Enchanter}} &mdash; Uses a {{Geo}}-infused lance and can summon [[Spirit of Omen: Stone Drake]]s
*{{Enemy|Eremite Galehunter}} &mdash; Uses an {{Anemo}}-infused bow and can summon [[Spirit of Omen: Wind Glede]]s
*{{Enemy|Eremite Floral Ring-Dancer}} &mdash; Uses a {{Dendro}}-infused chakram and can summon [[Spirit of Omen: Dendro Spirit-Serpent]]s
*{{Enemy|Eremite Scorching Loremaster}} &mdash; Uses a {{Pyro}}-infused catalyst and can summon [[Spirit of Omen: Pyro Scorpion]]s

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A group of loosely-organized mercenary corps. Will work for anyone as long as the pay is good.<br>"The Eremites" is an umbrella term that people from outside the desert have coined for them. But beneath this name, there are separate entities such as the sellsword group known as the [[Farrokhzadan]] and the tribe of [[Tanit]].<br>As a people led not by gods, most of these desert descendants wield their blades to make a living and offer their skills to those who pay.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

==Trivia==
* Eremites dissolve into sand upon being defeated rather than fading normally like other human enemies.
