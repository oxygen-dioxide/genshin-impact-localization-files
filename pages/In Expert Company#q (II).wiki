{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Ms. Qiu, Xingye, and Yifeng)
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' No problem. Our box is waterproof. All we need to do is dive down and fetch it...
:'''Xingye:''' Boss, none of us here knows how to dive.
:'''Yifeng:''' I know how to swim, but diving's beyond me.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Is... is the commission we posted at the Adventurers' Guild still on the board?
:'''Yifeng:''' Boss, didn't you say before that we should hurry up and take the commission down?
:'''Xingye:''' We did that yesterday. The guild said they can return us our prepaid commission posting fee today.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Uh... If we want to send out a commission again, are we going to need to pay an additional service fee...
:{{DIcon}} Have you guys finished your film?
:{{DIcon}} What are you guys doing here?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Adventurer... {{Traveler}}! You came right when we needed you!
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Can you dive? Or... can you help me find a diver with the ability and time to do a dive?
:{{DIcon}} You want to... do an underwater shoot?
:'''Yifeng:''' We're hardly that capable. We also can't afford water-proof film equipment.
:'''Xingye:''' It's purely because the box we put our films in fell into the water.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Alright, that's enough you two! {{Traveler}}, you gotta help us.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Don't worry about the payment. I'll pay you upfront, just like last time.

;(Talk to Ms. Qiu, Xingye, or Yifeng again, optional)
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' *sigh* I hope the films won't be damaged by the water.
:'''Yifeng:''' Don't worry Boss, the box is sealed tight. The water won't be getting in.
:'''Xingye:''' Good thing our Film Kamera didn't fall in. Otherwise, it would be a total flop...

;(Go underwater and pick up box)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Heavy Box (In Expert Company? (II))|text=Heavy Box}})

;(Talk to Ms. Qiu, Xingye, or Yifeng)
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Aha! You're the best, {{Traveler}}. You're the absolute best!
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' If it weren't for you, everything inside the case would have been lost.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' We need to get back to the city and give these films to Mr. Geisert.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' And then... let's have a meal together. {{Traveler}}, if you're interested, you can come too.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' After we finish eating, I'll pay you your reward.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I just happen to be hungry.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Alright! It's settled.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Yifeng, bring the films in this box over to Mr. Geisert later.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Xingye, go get some good greens from nearby. I've been practicing my [[Poisson Seafood Soup]], and it's time to show it off to Mr. Geisert.
:'''Xingye:''' Boss, we're already going to the restaurant. Why do you still get to do things yourself?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' So that we can save costs...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Ahem! It's settled. Let's get going.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' {{Traveler}}, you can follow me.

;(Approach Ms. Qiu and Xingye in [[Hotel Debord]])
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' This pot is pretty strange. Hmm... but it should be used the same way as the ones in Liyue.
:'''Xingye:''' Boss, I got the veggies, but they're all out of Marcotte.
:'''Xingye:''' I couldn't find any other store that sells it...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' That's... the last ingredient we needed. Well, uh, {{Traveler}}...
:{{DIcon}} I'll go fetch it.
:{{DIcon}} Include this with the payment.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Thanks for your help. Don't worry, I know how adventurers work. This isn't a free favor.

;(Talk to Ms. Qiu)
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' {{Traveler}}, did you get the Marcotte?
:{{DIcon}} I got it.
:;(Submit {{Item|Marcotte|x=2}})
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Okay, gotta get this meal started as soon as possible. Gotta do this fast. Mr. Geisert is almost here...
:;(Geisert arrives)<!--screen transition-->
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' {{Traveler}}, I'd like to introduce you to a master filmmaker, Mr. Geisert.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Mr. Geisert, this is {{Traveler}}, a highly skilled adventurer.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' If you plan to shoot an action film in the future, you should definitely consider casting {{Traveler}} as the lead!
:'''Geisert:''' Haha, Ms. Qiu exaggerates. I'm not some filmmaking expert.
:'''Geisert:''' I'm just someone who's somewhat familiar with the uses of lighting for filmmaking.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Ah, you're too modest. The lighting in your films practically speaks for itself.
:{{DIcon}} Uses of lighting for filmmaking?
::'''Geisert:''' Yeah. In my lighting theory, I believe that the manipulation of lighting is the manipulation of emotion.
:{{DIcon}} Is lighting very important in filmmaking?
::'''Geisert:''' Of course. In my theories, lighting is the key way mood is expressed in a scene.
:'''Geisert:''' But... how should I put this... My theories have yet to be regarded in Fontaine's film industry.
:'''Geisert:''' Most directors prefer to use direct movement or the scene itself to illustrate their stories.
:'''Geisert:''' I've shot a few films purely using lighting transitions to express narrative, but almost no one was interested.
:'''Geisert:''' But now, at least one director thinks my lighting theory has value.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Director? Me? Hahaha, don't jest. I was just a tea vendor.
:'''Geisert:''' Who said a tea vendor can't be a director? I was just a journalist before.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' A journalist... Then you must be good at writing reports? Just like those in the papers.
:'''Geisert:''' I suppose. What about it?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Huh... Just as well...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Ah! Nothing, nothing. Let's eat! We will have plenty of time to work together in the future, hahaha!
:{{Black Screen|Everyone takes a seat to Ms. Qiu's forthright laughter.}}
:{{Black Screen|After the meal, Ms. Qiu makes an additional meal and stuffs it in your bag after packaging it...}}
