{{Description|Azhdaha was unable to unseal itself in the end, and the quaking earth was at last put to rest.<br />Yet the memories of facing the sealed dragon in the heart of the earth itself remain ever so vivid.<br />Challenge it in your memories once more, and you may gain something new from that encounter...}}
'''Beneath the Dragon-Queller''' is a [[Trounce Domain]] unlocked after completing [[Zhongli]]'s [[Story Quest]], [[Historia Antiqua Chapter]]: Act II - [[No Mere Stone]]. Players can relive the fight they had with Lord of Vishaps [[Azhdaha]] and receive bountiful rewards.

It is located under the [[Dragon-Queller]] in [[Nantianmen]], [[Liyue]].

The domain entrance is marked with the elements that Azhdaha will absorb inside the domain, which change every week based on [[#Elements|a fixed rotation]].

==Boss Description==
{{Description|An enormous dragon as ancient as the mountains themselves. In an age that has all but faded from memory, he stood shoulder to shoulder with one who ruled over a harbor of stone. But in the end, the two came into conflict, and the dragon was banished to a dark place deep underground.<br />Over the long years of his imprisonment, his power has slowly dissipated. He has also become disfigured from the various kinds of erosion he has been subjected to.<br />The faint rattling of this dragon lord's shackles and his deep, angry growl echo through the bowels of the mountains like memories of a bygone era.|[[Archive]]}}

==Ley Line Disorder==
When Azhdaha's Cryo, Pyro, Electro, and Hydro attacks hit characters who are not under the protection of a shield, that character will be marked. Marked characters will continuously take {{Color|Black|Elemental DMG}}.

==Rules==
{{Transclude|Domain|trouncerule|section=1}}

==Rewards==
{{Weekly Boss Rewards
|exclusive=Dragon Lord's Crown,Bloodjade Branch,Gilded Scale
|gem=Prithiva Topaz,Varunada Lazurite,Vajrada Amethyst,Agnidus Agate,Shivada Jade
}}
Other than [[Prithiva Topaz]] {{Icon/Element|Geo|24}}, the possible Ascension Gems obtained depend on the [[#Elements|Elements]] Azhdaha infuses.

==Elements==
The four elements which can be infused by Azhdaha are {{Hydro}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, and {{Electro}}; each infused element produces different effects.
* The {{Pyro}} element enhances his attack radius and demands better character positioning
* The {{Hydro}} element focuses on projectiles and ranged attacks
* The {{Cryo}} element unleashes simultaneous attacks and increases the risk of elemental reactions
* The {{Electro}} element is tailored around evasion and precision.<ref name="The Birth of a Dragon">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/fwOlW3ndDa8 The Birth of a Dragon: A Behind the Scenes Look At the Creation of Azhdaha]</ref>

Azhdaha infuses the first element, either {{Hydro}} or {{Pyro}}, when he reaches 75% HP. He infuses a second element, either {{Electro}} or {{Cryo}}, upon reaching 45% HP. Damage dealt by Azhdaha will be converted to the respective elemental damage after triggering Elemental Infusion. After the second element is absorbed, all damage done by Azhdaha is considered elemental damage and will mark the current character until the element is dispelled.

The elemental combination can be seen on the seal of the domain, and the element color will also be reflected on several of his body parts, such as his paws for the first element and his tail for the second element.

==Strategy==
[[File:Azhdaha Pyro-Cryo Sigils.png|thumb|157x157px|The Pyro (bottom) and Cryo (top) sigils at the domain's entrance.]]

Before entering the Trounce Domain, players should check the two symbols on the entrance and assemble their party accordingly, as Azhdaha will infuse himself with the elements corresponding to those sigils and gain high resistances to them. See [[#Elements|Elements]] for each elemental symbol.

In all phases, it is advisable to attack him from the front or the back, but never from the side. Attacking from the side triggers the sideways Body Slam attack, which has a large AoE and cannot be countered by sprinting i-frame.

In phases 2 and 3, unless protected by a shield it is not advised to utilize [[Elemental Burst]] i-frames to avoid damage, as the effects of the Ley Line Disorder will still apply on hit even if the player is in an Elemental Burst animation.

===Character Recommendations===
* Characters that can [[Shields#Talent Shields|create shields]], while not essential, are extremely helpful to have in this fight, as it will prevent the highly lethal elemental mark from being applied.
* [[Healing|Healers]] are an effective means of improving survivability.
* Due to the high DMG of many of Azhdaha's attacks, it is still important to avoid as many of Azhdaha's attacks as possible even with shields and healing.
* Characters with abilities with large hitboxes can deal extended damage thanks to his massive body.
* In general, [[Bow]] and [[Catalyst]] users are safe for dealing damage at a distance.
* As Azhdaha gains Elemental RES to his infused Elements (including his innate Geo RES), using damage dealers of other elements can avoid prolonging the fight. {{Anemo}} characters equipped with the 4 piece [[Viridescent Venerer]] artifact set, or talents that decrease enemy Elemental RES such as [[Zhongli]]'s [[Dominus Lapidis]] can also help counter the increased Elemental RES.
* {{Anemo}} and {{Dendro}} characters can completely ignore Azhdaha's resistances gained from phase transformations due to him never infusing Anemo or Dendro.
* Triggering certain elemental reactions on the character can completely [[Ley Line Disorders#Removing Elemental Debuffs|remove]] the elemental mark without generating a shield. [[:Category:Anemo Status to Self Talents|Anemo]] can remove all of the elemental marks, [[:Category:Electro Status to Self Talents|Electro]] can remove the Cryo mark, [[:Category:Pyro Status to Self Talents|Pyro]] can remove the Hydro, Cryo, and Electro marks, and [[:Category:Wet Status to Self Talents|Hydro]] can remove the Pyro and Cryo marks.
* Fast runners, such as tall male characters and characters with access to [[Alternate Sprint]]s may be helpful against Azhdaha's AoE attack spams.

==Trivia==
* Surrounding the "arena" where Azhdaha is sealed, and around the forcefield that Azhdaha breaks out of when combat begins, stand a large number of [[Stone Stele]]s, which have the same markings as those created by Zhongli's Elemental Skill. Unlike those other Steles however, the ones surrounding the arena no longer seem to be functioning and show signs of heavy erosion, some having to be held up by chains.
* The element symbols marked on the entrance are written in the [[Liyue Language|Liyue script]], based on the Chinese characters for each element.
** These symbols are also used as particle effects in his infused states.
* The boss fight was originally supposed to have all 12 combinations of Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, and Electro, but this was dropped during development because it was too challenging in terms of the color schemes, special effects, and processing power.<ref name="The Birth of a Dragon" />
