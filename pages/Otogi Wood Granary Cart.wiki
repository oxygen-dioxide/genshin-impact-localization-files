|description    = A pushcart that carries supplies of grain. These carts tend to be made from hastily-modified [[Otogi Wood]], while the grain sacks have been tightly bound.<br />The old farmers of [[Inazuma]] have a secret trick to storing grain: they oven-dry [[Lavender Melon]] skin and grind it into powder before adding tea powder, stir-frying them both, and pouring the lot to mix with grain. This helps to prevent pests and mildew from setting in. However, the aforementioned method does give any grain so processed a rather strange smell, and it is for that reason that such methods are rarely used anymore.
