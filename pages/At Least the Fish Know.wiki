{{Quest Description|The journalist Linorea seems troubled by something...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Linorea)
;(If this quest has not been completed before)
::'''Linorea:''' The number of fish in here has decreased again. Are the Mekafish acting up again?
::'''Linorea:''' I need to put the fry out into deeper waters... Ugh, why did my divesuit have to give out now?
::{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
::'''Linorea:''' Hello there. Pleased to meet you. I'm Linorea, a journalist specializing in reporting on environmental issues. I'm... putting fish fry into these waters.
:;(If player didn't complete [[Other Duties]] before)
:::{{DIcon}} A journalist?
::::'''Linorea:''' That's right, the sort you know of. But I'm not like those who publish gossip about public figures or regurgitate boring news all day.
::::'''Linorea:''' What I'm concerned about is an ongoing, serious issue that threatens the safety of the general public here in the Court of Fontaine.
::::'''Linorea:''' And that is why I am here putting fry out into the waters.
:::{{DIcon}} And why are you doing that, exactly?
:;(If player completed [[Other Duties]] before)
:::'''Paimon:''' Wait, you look familiar. Weren't you with Semaine when we last saw him, Linorea?
:::{{DIcon}} You must be Semaine's...
:::'''Linorea:''' Wait, you know Semaine? Are you... Oh, were you the ones who helped him bring those gifts? Thank you so much.
:::'''Linorea:''' Semaine only told me about that after I'd finished watching the opera and returned home previously. Honestly, I've been looking to invite you for a meal at my place.
:::'''Linorea:''' I didn't think I would meet you here... but this is really bad timing...
:::'''Paimon:''' You just said that you're throwing fry into the water, right?
:::{{DIcon}} And why are you doing that, exactly?
::'''Linorea:''' Do you know about Mekafish?
::{{DIcon}} Never heard of them.
::{{DIcon}} Are they a species unique to the Court of Fontaine?
::'''Linorea:''' Hmph. These Mekafish are clockwork machines created by the Fontaine Research Institute. They're the ones ruining the waters in the Court of Fontaine!
::'''Linorea:''' A water body usually has a balanced ecosystem where various fish and other creatures live together within a stable order. This order allows them to grow and thrive.
::'''Linorea:''' Even though this order is sometimes disrupted when, say, people come to fish, when invasive species are introduced...
::'''Linorea:''' Sometimes, the weather also shifts, causing some fish to leave these waters...
::'''Linorea:''' There is a subtle balance being maintained within this water body, on the whole.
::'''Linorea:''' But everything turned into a complete mess ever since those idiots at the Institute created the Mekafish!
::'''Linorea:''' They promote them as tools that can keep the waters clean by removing trash and other assorted items in the water. Nothing else, they say!
::'''Linorea:''' And at first, that is what they did, and we believed the nonsense they fed us.
::'''Linorea:''' But after a while, we received reports that fish populations were constantly decreasing in water bodies where Mekafish were deployed.
::'''Linorea:''' That's when we realized that the Mekafish labeled other fish as "trash" when doing their cleanup work!
::{{DIcon}} So that's how they define "clean water"...
::{{DIcon}} Everything that's not water is considered trash...
::'''Linorea:''' Faced with intense resistance from us, those researchers deactivated the Mekafish and prepared for their retrieval.
::'''Linorea:''' But as they were preparing to do so, there was a huge explosion at the Institute...
::'''Linorea:''' After that, some of those originally deactivated Mekafish reactivated themselves, and began attacking fish even more fiercely.
::'''Linorea:''' Several of my colleagues and I agreed that this could not go on. If the Mekafish are left to run amok, they will bring calamity upon our aquatic ecosystem!
::'''Linorea:''' So, with the help of several environmentalists, we planned to place suitable fish fry in various water bodies and cultivate new batches of fish through artificial means.
::'''Linorea:''' On the other hand, we hired adventurers to constantly destroy and retrieve Mekafish, thus forming a two-pronged approach to protecting the ecology of our waters.
::{{DIcon}} An impressive ambition.
::{{DIcon}} An admirable plan.
::'''Linorea:''' Thank you for your praise &mdash; I know this doesn't sound like something a journalist should be doing.
::'''Linorea:''' However, I believe that our duty to go to the frontline and do some practical work comes before writing essays and articles.
::'''Linorea:''' Only by doing frontline work can we obtain the truest and most accurate information, with which the best report can be written.
::'''Paimon:''' Wow, this reporter's really impressive...
::{{DIcon}} What can I do to help?
::'''Linorea:''' Hmm? Well, thanks for your kind offer. My divesuit is currently non-functional, so I can't go underwater to distribute fish fry.
::'''Linorea:''' If you don't mind, could you go down and do it for me? Shallow or deep zones, doesn't matter.
;(If this quest has been completed before)
::'''Linorea:''' These Mekafish... What a pain!
::{{DIcon}} What's happened?
::{{DIcon}} Have you fixed your divesuit?
::'''Linorea:''' I did, but it fell apart quite quickly afterward.
::'''Linorea:''' The Mekafish in this area have gone hog-wild, for... whatever reason.
::'''Linorea:''' No sooner did I try to place the fish fry in their vicinity that they swarmed over, gobbling the fry up non-stop.
::'''Linorea:''' Some of them even lunged at me to get the few fry hanging off my divesuit...
::'''Linorea:''' I mean, I know they won't attack me... But that was still terrifying.
::'''Linorea:''' I struggled, flailing in the water...
::'''Linorea:''' I don't know how, but that tore another large hole in my divesuit somewhere... Fortunately, I was close enough to the shore that getting back up ultimately proved possible.
::'''Linorea:''' As things stand, however, I won't be able to distribute the fry for the time being.
::'''Linorea:''' Traveler, could you help me do it once again? Shallow or deep zones, doesn't matter.
:{{DIcon}} I'll go check out the deep waters.
:{{DIcon}} I'll check out the shallow waters.
:'''Linorea:''' I'm counting on you. Unfortunately, given the state of my divesuit... that's all I can do right now.
:;(Obtain {{Item|A Can of Fry}})

;(Talk to Linorea again, optional)
:'''Linorea:''' Have you helped me place the fry into the water? Given the state of my divesuit, I can only count on you at the moment.

;(After placing all the fry)
:'''Paimon:''' That should do it. Let's go back and look for Linorea!

;(Talk to Linorea)
:'''Linorea:''' Have you helped me place the fry into the water?
:{{DIcon}} I have.
:'''Linorea:''' Thanks so much. Once I fix my divesuit, I'll come back and continue my work.
:{{DIcon}} I hope those fish will grow up safely.
:'''Linorea:''' Don't worry, I've prepared many species of fry for all sorts of waters and different environments.
:'''Linorea:''' The batch that you placed earlier was chosen specifically for this region.
:'''Linorea:''' I'll place a few more batches, and then the adventurers we hired will come over and clear out the Mekafish in the area.
:'''Linorea:''' I believe that this batch will grow up healthy and restore the ecological environment in this area.
:'''Linorea:''' Once enough water bodies have recovered, I'll write a long-form report. I'll tell the public what the Fontaine Research Institute has done to our natural environment.
:'''Linorea:''' Just you wait, [[Damestier]]. I won't let you stop me again!
