|description    = A relatively common flower found throughout Natlan, its vivid orange blossoms pretty as bursts of flame. They say that its seeds can serve as a substitute for grain, while its young leaves, stems, and buds can be eaten as wild vegetables. During the war against the Abyss, its high rate of reproduction and abundant seed yield provided sustenance for countless people. Even today, some people will still cultivate these flowers at home &mdash; not only for decoration, but also to harvest their seeds and tender leaves.
