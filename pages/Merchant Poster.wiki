The '''Merchant Posters''' are Quest Items for the {{Quest|Lingering Malady}}. These posters can be found on rooftops in the [[City of Mondstadt]] after completing the {{Quest|Dragon Storm}}, but can only be picked up during the World Quest.

These posters were blown away during [[Dvalin|Stormterror]]'s rampage. After finishing the quest, they will be placed around the city in their proper places.
