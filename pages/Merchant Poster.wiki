The '''Merchant Posters''' are quest items for the [[World Quest]] [[Lingering Malady]]. These posters can be seen on rooftops in [[Mondstadt]] even before accepting the quest, but can only be picked up during the quest.

These posters were blown away during [[Dvalin|Stormterror]]'s rampage. After finishing the quest, they will be placed around the city in their proper places.
