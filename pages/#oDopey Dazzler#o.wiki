==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Alright! Once we finish the next graffiti piece, it's off to Frida's Palette to try out new color combinations!
:{{DIcon}} Graffiti?
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' It's those paintings you see on cliffs, walls, and the ground everywhere here in Natlan. It's our local art form, and it's only popular here!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Huh? Feels like I've seen you somewhere before! I can't quite remember where, though... Wonder if that's a residual effect of the accident before.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' I was painting a cliffside when i accidentally snapped the safety line and hit my head in the fall...
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Was laid up in bed, my head all swathed in bandages, for three months before making a recovery. And even now, I still feel pretty dizzy...
::{{DIcon}} Take care of yourself!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Sure! Graffiti's key, but I should probably steer clear of accidents if I want to make anything truly great, eh?
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' The [[Scions of the Canopy]] really have advantages when it comes to high-altitude work. Gah, I'm so envious!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' But putting aside all this stuff for now...
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' You've got a radiant complexion, keen senses, distinguished temperament, and a unique sense of geniality...
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' If you join this line of work, you'll definitely have what it takes to be the vanguard of avant-garde &mdash; a rising star amongst graffiti artists!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' If you're interested, you can follow me, the Dopey Dazzler, in grasping the latest and greatest in trendy artistic thought!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' I will teach you everything I know, without reservation!
:{{DIcon}} Color combinations?
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Yeah. Bold lines and visually stimulating colors are key to graffiti.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' However, my observations indicate that the human eye is more likely to notice large blocks of vibrant color at a certain distance...
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' That means we're first drawn in by a color before we consider its outline.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Therefore, a combination of colors that leaves people feeling brighter with a single glance &mdash; full of vitality, even! &mdash; is crucial to how some graffiti "grabs" the eye.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' If you're interested in color combos, swing around for a chat anytime!
:{{DIcon}} Well, I shan't bother you, then.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' All good, all good. Safe travels!

==Event Dialogue==
===Traces of Artistry===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Hello, my rising graffiti stars. Anything else you'd like to know?
:'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' If there's nothing else, get ready to head out! I'll be out for a walk through the wilds myself. Gotta look for good cliffsides that haven't been painted yet. Don't you be slower than me, now!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about graffiti as an art form...
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm. It's all over Natlan in crazy colors &mdash; on houses, trees, mountains, even on people...
::'''Paimon:''' It seems to be a custom here, so... when did it start?
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Aha, interested in hearing some graffiti history, are you? Good, good!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' The techniques we ordinary people now master are generalized forms of "[[Phlogiston Engraving]]s."
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' You might have heard of the process itself, where professional inscribers use blades to carve such engravings for mighty tribal warriors.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Each tribe has an engraving unique to them, and they are immensely useful, whether for communicating with [[Saurian]] companions, or in battle.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that does ring a bell... So that's what it's called.
::{{DIcon}} It's no ordinary body of symbols...
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Indeed! For us normal folks, these symbols are marks of courage, ability, and honor. Nothing more avant-garde than these, if you ask me!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' That's why many imitate the inscribers and spray similar patterns in various locations.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Of course, they're mighty champions, and we're pretty mundane by comparison, so our works don't serve much purpose beyond expressing our emotions.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Over time, the artistic content expanded from those patterns into all manner of different expressions, growing increasingly free-spirited, eventually evolving into its modern form.
::'''Paimon:''' Symbols of the strong, huh? That kinda makes sense... Who'd have thought graffiti had such a long history...
::'''Paimon:''' You know, we could pick a few large buildings in the [[Serenitea Pot]] and cover their walls in huge pictures of all the formidable people we've met during our journey!
::{{DIcon}} Haha, then let's start with [[Venti|that bard]]!
:::'''Paimon:''' That would work! Why don't we draw a bunch of kittens nearby, too?
::{{DIcon}} Our [[Zhongli|well-traveled, knowledgeable consultant]] would make the perfect candidate too.
:::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, yeah. Just the thought of it puts Paimon at ease! ... Wait, but would [[Tubby]] ever dare take a nap again?
::{{DIcon}} How about a Statue of [[Raiden Shogun|Her Excellency, the God of Thunder]]?
:::'''Paimon:''' Should we paint her in a more majestic pose? Maybe raise a couple more Finches?
::{{DIcon}} What say you to [[Nahida|Mahakusaladhamma]], the Blessed One of Wisdom?
:::'''Paimon:''' We should decorate the Realm Within with some extra pretty flowers and plants, then!
::{{DIcon}} Perhaps [[Furina|Fontaine's number-one star]] might be a good pick.
:::'''Paimon:''' Great idea &mdash; we'd need a super gorgeous open-air stage to go with it, and maybe some pretty lighting too...
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Haha, draw on. Draw 'em all, even!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Once your skills mature, you can showcase all the companions and objects you want, no problem!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' But before that, you need to understand the core philosophy behind graffiti, and you need practice.
::'''Paimon:''' Of course! But just you wait &mdash; we're quick learners and then some!
:{{DIcon}} So, about avant-garde artistic thought...
::'''Paimon:''' You always have lots to say about "avant-garde." Did you have a teacher who particularly emphasized that?
::'''Paimon:''' But Paimon guesses that you've never left Natlan before, so are there schools here that specialize in teaching art?
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' School? Never been anywhere like that.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' I'm speaking from experience here, combined with books I've read that adventurers brought in from beyond our lands &mdash; of course, it took me a long while to figure it out.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' If anything, I'm the one teaching others, no?
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' It just so happens that I plan on leaving a training area in the [[Graffiti Alliance]] headquarters...
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' If I manage to help you uncover your talent, I might as well handle any newcomers {{sic|in future}} too.
::'''Paimon:''' Headquarters? Paimon thought your Alliance also existed as a sort of identity. Y'know, like [[Genius Invokation TCG]] players.
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Well, we do have the... lofty ambition of matching the [[Adventurers' Guild]], so having a headquarters is a must, even if that means a bit of fundraising!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Our current plans have us finishing it in short order, so if you get the chance, do drop by and hang out with us!
:{{DIcon}} So, about your name...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's been meaning to ask that too. Is "Dopey Dazzler" your real name?
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' As graffiti artists, our real names aren't anywhere near as important as our titles!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Mine comes from a very, very, very awesome friend...
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' She said I have an uncanny ability to discover dazzling color combos, and others say that I get all dopey when blending paints... So I combined the two, and the rest is history!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' We haven't had much opportunity to hang out since we first met, but that title has been a massive inspiration to me!
::'''Paimon:''' A nickname inspired by an awesome friend... Guess that makes sense...
::'''Paimon:''' But as for the word "dopey"... Eh, guess "avant-garde" doesn't involve being too concerned about the meaning of individual words.
:{{DIcon}} We'll continue our studies.
::'''Paimon:''' Yup. We'll continue our search for inspiration, just as you've taught us!
::'''"Dopey Dazzler":''' Right on! Don't forget to use both your heart and your head! Let your imagination run wild!
