|info          = When Kirara is in the Urgent Neko Parcel state of [[Meow-teor Kick]], each impact against an opponent will grant her a stack of Reinforced Packaging. This effect can be triggered once for each opponent hit every 0.5s. Max 3 stacks. When the Urgent Neko Parcel state ends, each stack of Reinforced Packaging will create 1 Shield of Safe Transport for Kirara. The shields that are created this way will have 20% of the DMG absorption that the Shield of Safe Transport produced by Meow-teor Kick would have. If Kirara is already protected by a Shield of Safe Transport created by Meow-teor Kick, its DMG absorption will stack with these shields and its duration will reset.
