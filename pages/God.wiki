{{Lang|'''Gods'''|zh=神|zh_rm=Shén}} are beings from the [[Human Realm]] with great control over elemental energy and whose lifespans are typically much longer than that of mortals. Most of Teyvat's gods are beholden to [[Celestia]], although several gods have displayed wariness or even resentment towards the heavenly citadel.

Before the [[Archon War]], many gods roamed the continent of [[Teyvat]]. After [[Primordial One]] was so severely wounded and their functions were ruined, efforts were made to uphold the world order;<ref name="Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision">{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision}}</ref> seven divine seats opened up in Celestia,<ref name="TLTF1">{{Ref/Quest|Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1)}}</ref><ref name="TLTF2">{{Ref/Quest|Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 2)}}</ref> causing the continent to descend into a protracted series of conflicts that ended 2000 years ago. Over the course of the war, most gods were slain or sealed until only seven victors remained; each victor became their respective element's Archon and ruler of one of the seven nations,<ref group="Note">It is currently unclear whether the seven nations' territories were already determined before the start of the Archon War or not.</ref> using their powers to transform its terrain and governing the land according to their ideals.

==Overview==
Very little is currently known about the origins of gods. [[Egeria]] gained both godhood and the divine duty after receiving a shard of [[Primordial One]],<ref>{{Ref/Item|Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters}}</ref> which were scattered in the [[Great War of Vengeance|great war of vengeance]]. <ref name="Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision"/> Perhaps existences become gods by receiving those fragments. As evidenced by [[Boreas]] and [[Barbatos]], gods can be elevated from a lower existence and given powers from another god.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|4}}</ref><ref name="Andrius">{{Ref/Enemy|Andrius}}</ref> [[Morax]], [[Makoto]], and [[Ei]]'s origins have been left a mystery, and have presently been referred to as gods since the start of their recorded histories.<!-- Ei refers to herself as "the most supreme and terrifying incarnation of lightning in the whole of Teyvat."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|When Thunder Strikes}}</ref>-->

In the past, gods were expected to have a love for humanity, and use their powers as gods to guide and protect humanity; Boreas, who held a low opinion of human society, was viewed as an oddity.<ref name="BWMT">{{Ref/Item|Boreal Wolf's Milk Tooth}}</ref><ref name="wolfnost">{{Ref/Item|Boreal Wolf's Nostalgia}}</ref> However, after The Seven were established and its original members passed on, the newer archons no longer upheld the duty of guiding humanity.<ref name="ZLS5">{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|5}}</ref>

Gods cannot be completely destroyed &mdash; even if a god's physical form is destroyed, their consciousness is worn away, and they are considered "dead," their emotions and power remain.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|1}}</ref> [[Havria]]'s relics kept their special properties thousands of years after her death and were ultimately thrown into the ocean by [[Zhongli]] so that humanity would not seek the power of a long-dead deity. Gods who place their power into the land, such as Boreas and [[Marchosius]], may be considered "dead" but can continue manifesting in the world afterwards,<ref name="3TGR">{{Ref/Quest|Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go}}</ref> although how this works is currently unclear.<ref group="Note">Boreas is explicitly stated to have died but can manifest himself at Wolvendom to answer a challenge and is fully conscious with his memories intact. Marchosius was only described as having entered a deep slumber, but he manifested at the shrine while Xiangling was asleep with the suggestion that he was not present when she entered the shrine. As a result of placing his power into the land, Marchosius also lost most of his mental faculties and is no longer capable of speech, unlike Boreas.</ref>

Upon death, a god's power flows out of their body and into the surrounding environment. The consequences of a god's death vary greatly, so what determines the result is currently unclear. Boreas was able to control the flow of power and use it to the benefit of the land when he voluntarily chose death.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Spirit Locket of Boreas}}</ref> The power released upon Havria's death salinized her adherents and [[Sal Terrae]] was sealed off afterwards,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, Sweet Salt}}</ref> but the region as a whole has shown no ill effects following her death. Meanwhile, a god's hatred will have negative effects on the surrounding environment and the people who reside there; for example, the [[Tatarigami]] on [[Yashiori Island]] afflicted inhabitants of the island with mysterious diseases and drove others to insanity. [[Wildlife]] that comes across the remains of a god and consumes it for a prolonged period of time will transform into a [[Consecrated Beast]], assuming they survive the process. On the other hand, [[Remus]]'s death had no apparent negative effects on the [[Sea of Bygone Eras]]; instead, his will protected the ruins of Capitolium, preserving them remarkably well over 2,000 years.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Gradus ad Capitolium|'''Scylla:''' The "Eternal City," indeed... Remus's will protects this place still, just as I expected. No wonder that brazen, shameless traitor has endured even til this day...}}</ref><ref group ="Note">While Remus sacrificed his life to unleash the power of the [[Phobos|Symphony]], it was the Symphony's power that caused the tsunami that sank Remuria, not his death.</ref>

The Seven have come up with various ways of counteracting such effects, such as the [[Yakshas]] in Liyue who fight against the power of ancient gods,<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/180703 Developer Insight #4: Character Stories (I) - "Vigilant Yaksha" Xiao (Part I)]</ref> and the wards around Inazuma used to suppress the likes of Tatarigami and [[Kanna Kapatcir]]'s power.

==Story==
===Ancient History===
Based on current knowledge, most if not all gods came into being after the establishment of the [[Human Realm]] and hold the Human Realm's power, making them incompatible with the [[Light Realm]] and [[Void Realm]]'s powers under normal circumstances.<ref name="Experimental Records">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4}}</ref> Elemental [[dragons]] hold power equal to a god's.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest|1}}</ref>

===Archon War===
{{See also|Archon War}}
The Archon War was a prolonged conflict between gods for supremacy that began several thousand years ago and ended two thousand years ago.<ref name="TLTF1" /> The war allegedly began over the seven divine thrones which opened up in Celestia,<ref name="TLTF2" /> which may coincide with the creation of the [[Gnosis|Gnoses]] following the "great war of vengeance" which greatly weakened the [[Heavenly Principles]].<ref name="Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision"/> According to [[Neuvillette]], all fragments of the primordial were driven to devour each other.<ref name="Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision"/>

Instead of warring, [[Sumeru]]'s gods, [[King Deshret]], [[Nabu Malikata]], and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Rukkhadevata]] forged an alliance in the city of [[Ay-Khanoum]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref> However, King Deshret still engaged in warfare against other gods in Sumeru beyond the alliance, such as [[Remus]].<ref name="HSP">{{ref/Arti|Harmonious Symphony Prelude}}</ref> Nabu Malikata later allowed herself to be corrupted by the [[Abyss]],<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Secret-Keeper's Magic Bottle}}</ref> and the alliance was broken,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Shadow of the Sand King}}</ref> with Rukkhadevata leaving Deshret's lands, never to return.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III}}</ref>

The [[Guili Assembly]], established by [[Guizhong]] and [[Rex Lapis]] in [[Guili Plains]] in the distant past, was one civilization destroyed during the chaos of the Archon War. Shortly after the fall of the Guili Assembly 3,700 years ago, Rex Lapis and the [[adepti]] gathered the survivors and took them south of Mt. Tianheng, where Liyue Harbor was established.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref> Some time afterwards, [[Havria]] was murdered by her own people for being weak, and the survivors of [[Sal Terrae]] were scattered across Liyue. Rex Lapis subdued countless other gods and monsters, including [[Osial]], [[Chi]], and [[Orobashi]], the latter whom survived and fled to Inazuma.<ref group="Note">Orobashi narrates in [[Oathsworn Eye#Lore|Oathsworn Eye]]'s description that it was defeated by the {{Lang|"Golden God"|zh=贵金之神}}. The Chinese term was later used in [[Neuvillette]]'s [[Neuvillette/Voice-Overs#About the Geo Archon|"About the Geo Archon"]] Voice-Over, although it was localized into English as "Deus Auri."</ref>

2600 years ago in [[Old Mondstadt]], in the midst of the Archon War, [[Boreas]] warred against the God of Storms, [[Decarabian]]. In their bitter stalemate, [[Barbatos]] challenged Decarabian for the freedom of Decarabian's people and emerged victorious. After Decarabian's death, Barbatos became the new Anemo Archon,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|3}}</ref> while Boreas decided himself unfit for the position and chose to pass on instead, using his winds to nurture the new [[Mondstadt]] that Barbatos created.<ref name="wolfnost" />

In [[Inazuma]], the twin gods [[Makoto]] and [[Ei]] emerged victorious, with Makoto assuming the position of Electro Archon and her sister sharing many of her duties while acting as her kagemusha. The only rival god known to have been slain during this period was the god of [[Watatsumi Island]], [[Orobashi]], though the Thunderbird of [[Tsurumi Island]], [[Kapatcir|Kanna Kapatcir]], was revered as a god by her people. Notably, the duty of slaying such foes during the Archon War fell upon Ei, rather than the Electro Archon.

In [[Fontaine]], [[Remus]] was the sole god residing in Fontaine's surface during the Archon War, due to [[Egeria]]'s imprisonment [[Primordial Sea|beneath the waves]] at the behest of the Heavenly Principles.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Ancient Sea's Nocturnal Musing}}</ref> The war in Fontaine instead took the form of [[Remuria]]'s expansion and subjugation of various tribes, and a resistance movement led by the mortal, [[Erinnyes (NPC)|Erinnyes]] of Aremorica, who spread the faith of Egeria. Following the death of Remus at the hands of [[Phobos]], and the drowning of Remuria, Egeria was freed from her prison and granted rulership over Fontaine as its Archon<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Splendor of Tranquil Waters}}</ref>.

Gods had no place in [[Natlan]], the Archon War period instead saw repeated conflicts between the [[dragons]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Smokeless War}}</ref> and between dragons and humans of Natlan. The first [[Pyro Archon]] was a human named [[Xbalanque]] who defeated the still-reigning Sovereign [[Xiuhcoatl]], and was thus granted authority over the divine throne and ascended to godhood by the Ruler of Death, [[Ronova]]<ref>Archon Quest, Chapter V, Act II - ''Black Stone Under a White Stone'', Part 3: ''[[Echoes of Life]]''</ref>, as planned by the dragon Sage, [[Kukulkan]]<ref>Artifact Set, [[Obsidian Codex]]</ref>. However, the god [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night|Yohualtecuhtin]] of the [[Night Kingdom]] had numerous relations with humans in ancient history, first helping create the [[Wayob]] for the tribes,<ref name="MythsNR">{{Ref/Arti|Myths of the Night Realm}}</ref> and later helping create the "Rules" of Natlan such as the [[Ode of Resurrection]] with the help of Xbalanque and Ronova. 

Around 2000 years ago, the Archon War drew to a close as the seventh and final victor claimed their seat. These victors were thereafter known as the [[Seven Archons]], and came to possess one of the [[Gnosis|Gnoses]] as well as a portion of the elemental Authority for their element. Gods who refused to live under their rule fled to islands within the Dark Sea, regions beyond the control of The Seven, where they became evil gods.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Bit of Aerosiderite}}</ref>

Of the seven victors of the Archon War, only two remain by the start of the game's story: Barbatos and Rex Lapis.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/kTeoJLD8U0Y Version 1.1 "A New Star Approaches" Trailer description]</ref><ref name="Solitary Fragrance">{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref> While Ei was present during the Archon War, she did not assume the position of Electro Archon until her twin sister Makoto perished during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago. Most of [[The Seven]]'s current members replaced the original founders of Teyvat's seven nations.

===Present Day===
Among The Seven, each Archon is associated with and worshipped by one of Teyvat's seven nations. Most of a nation's elemental environment is based on its Archon's element, although areas affected by [[Celestial Nail]]s, such as [[Dragonspine]], the [[Great Red Sand]], the [[Night Kingdom]], and [[Tsurumi Island]] tend to be noticeably different from their surroundings.

An Archon's power is directly tied to their level of control over their nation. As a result, [[Venti]] &mdash; who travels as a bard and refuses to directly control the people of Mondstadt &mdash; is, by his own admission, extremely weak by Archon standards.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Abyss Mage (Quest)}}</ref> However, this is later indirectly challenged by [[Nahida]], who states that an Archon's power is tied to how much faith their people have in them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|page=Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref>When a person's powerful wish reaches the heavens, Archons are obligated to give that person a Vision, which is a shard of the elemental Authorities<ref name="Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision"/> and allows the recipient to manipulate elemental energy. Vision wielders are known as "allogenes" and are also privileged with the chance of rising to godhood.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> In the year that the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] was in effect in Inazuma, no new Electro Visions appeared throughout Teyvat, leading scholars to conclude that the Archons' wills play a role in Vision distribution.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Research}}</ref> However, Ei is surprised to hear of this phenomenon herself and refutes the scholars' conclusion.<ref name="ei vision dialogue">{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About the Vision}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The term God is unisex, with female figures like Ei and Nahida being referred to as Gods rather than Goddesses. This is not absolute however, such as with the Goddess of Flowers.
* Each gemstone used for [[Character Ascension Material|ascension]] has the words and blessings from The Seven for the reader.
* Gods can take whatever form they please; Morax has taken the form of a young man, a woman, and an elderly man,<ref>{{Ref/Book|Rex Incognito}}</ref> with [[Zhongli]] as his most recent vessel. Venti's vessel is based on the [[Nameless Bard]]'s.
** Vessels constructed through an archon's power have different compositions from regular human bodies; for example, Venti cannot be healed normally (in story, not in gameplay), while Zhongli indicates that he cannot get sick. That said, Venti is somehow allergic to cats. These human vessels are nonetheless not untouchable, as Venti is visibly winded and knocked unconscious from La Signora's attack.
* Due to stylistic choices made by original Chinese text and the English localization, some of the terminology pertaining to gods has been the subject of debate.
** In Chinese, gods before the rise of The Seven are often distinguished by including {{zh|魔神|tl=Demon God}} in their titles, but the English localization does not keep this term and usually translates it as "God" or omits it entirely. For example, [[Decarabian]]'s title of {{zh|烈风的魔神|tl=Demon God of Gales}} was localized as "God of Storms," while [[Guizhong]]'s {{zh|尘王魔神|tl=Dust Lord Demon God}} was localized as "Lord of Dust" and Osial's {{zh|漩涡之魔神|tl=Demon God of Vortexes}} was localized as "Overlord of the Vortex."
** Conversely, the term "Archon" is used in the English localization to denote The Seven's members, based on the game's Gnostic inspiration. However, there is no equivalent term in their Chinese titles, which led to early localization issues where many instances of {{zh|神|rm=shén|tl=god}} were indiscriminately translated as "archon" without taking context into account. In Version 1.3, the English localization adjusted most instances of "archon" to primarily refer to The Seven, but some instances have not been changed.
*** The Chinese name for [[Archon Quests]] is {{zh|魔神任务|tl=Demon God Quests,}} indicating that the Traveler's journey will involve the gods of old and not just The Seven.
** The original Chinese text distinguishes some of [[Morax]]'s accomplishments before becoming one of The Seven with the title {{zh|岩之魔神|tl=Demon God of Geo,}} as seen in ''[[Heart of Glaze]]'' and Zhongli's Character Story, [[Zhongli/Lore#That Which Rises From the Sea|That Which Rises From the Sea]]. In both instances, the English localization opted to translate the title as "Geo Archon" anyways. While ''Heart of Glaze'' made no attempt to distinguish the phrase from typical occurrences of "Geo Archon" (which would normally be either {{zh|岩神}} or {{zh|岩之神}}), ''That Which Rises From the Sea'' added the phrase "long before he took that title" to clarify that the story occurred before Morax became one of The Seven.

===Etymology===
* The term "{{wt|archon}}" is a Greek word that refers to "A person who claims the right to rule, or to exercise power or sovereign authority over other human beings." Genshin Impact uses its {{w|Gnosticism|Gnostic}} usage,<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv10739818 {{Zh|日本女性向杂志「}}PASH{{Zh|」采访原神开发者}}]</ref> in which the {{w|Archon (Gnosticism)|archons}} are seven supernatural beings subservient to the {{w|demiurge}}, the creator of the material universe who is beneath the {{w|Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad}}, the true God. Each archon presides over one of the {{w|Classical planet|seven planets}}. By reaching ''{{w|gnosis}}'', an understanding of divine knowledge, one can transcend the confines of the mortal world and escape the dominion of the archons.
** In Manichaeism, a religion derived from Gnosticism, there are five archons who together make up the Prince of Darkness. Here, the Archons are seen as an undeniably evil force.
* The Chinese term for gods that predate The Seven, {{zh|魔神|tl=demon god,}} stems from the standard Chinese translation for the {{w|List of demons in the Ars Goetia|demons in the Ars Goetia}} &mdash; from which a deity's name is derived &mdash; is {{zh|所罗门七十二柱'''魔神'''|tl={{w|zh:所羅門七十二柱魔神|Solomon's 72 Demon Gods}}.}}
** {{w|Barbatos}}, {{w|Morax (demon)|Morax}}, {{w|Baal}}, {{w|Buer (demon)|Buer}}, {{w|Haborym}}, {{w|Bifrons}}, {{w|Amy (demon)|Amy}}, {{w|Naberius}}, {{w|Paimon}}, and {{w|Bune}} are directly lifted from the Ars Goetia.
*** Beelzebul is an alternate spelling of {{w|Beelzebub}}, who is associated with Baal but is not from the Ars Goetia.
*** Haborym is an alternate name for Aim.
** Ronova is derived from {{W|Ronove}}.
** Istaroth is derived from {{w|Astaroth}}.
** Focalors is derived from {{w|Focalor}}.
** Amun is derived from {{w|Aamon|Amon/Aamon}} and the Egyptian deity {{w|Amun}}.
** Andrius may be derived from {{w|List of demons in the Ars Goetia#Andras|Andras}}, or {{w|Andrealphus}} based on his Chinese name. (See [[Boreas#Etymology|Boreas' Etymology section]] for details.)
** Decarabian is derived from {{w|Decarabia}}.
** Haagentus, the other name of Guizhong, is derived from {{w|Haagenti}}.
** Havria is a feminized form of Havres, a corruption/misinterpretation of {{w|Flauros}}.
** Marchosius is derived from {{w|Marchosias}}.
** Osial appears to be a portmanteau of {{w|Ose}} and either {{w|Belial}} or {{w|Furfur}}, the latter based on its Chinese name. (See [[Osial#Etymology|Osial's Etymology section]] for details.)
** Orobashi is derived from {{w|Orobas}}.
* The Chinese and Japanese term for "allogenes" is {{Lang|"primordial god"|zh=原神|zh_rm=Yuánshén|ja=原神|ja_rm=Genshin|sort=zh,ja}}, the same word used in the game's title.
** In Gnosticism, "{{w|Allogenes}}," also known as the "Stranger," is a Gnostic figure who is half-human, half-divine, and has the power to communicate with other realms. In some writings about Allogenes, he is said to have become fully divine.
