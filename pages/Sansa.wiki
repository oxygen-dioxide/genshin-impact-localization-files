==Profile==
Sansa's parents did not approve of her dream to become a bard, a career they believed to have no job security, and pushed for her to succeed in academics. They would force her to study in her room, where she found comfort in the bards that played music outside her window. When she made up her mind to become a bard, she had a falling-out with her parents.

It is later revealed that Sansa takes a very rigorous, academic approach to practicing music, and she has already mastered music theory and her instrument. However, her performance anxiety makes her stutter and forget the right words. Thanks to the help of [[Venti]], the [[Traveler]], and a cat named "Charcoal," Sansa gains more confidence in her skills and now stammers much less often.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To the Winds of Freedom}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Sansa wears the standard female bard outfit, which consists of a white blouse and brown skirt covered by a red dress. She has dark brown hair tied in short pigtails, brown eyes, and wears black glasses.

;(Before completing To the Winds of Freedom)
:'''Sansa:''' Perfect timing. Listen to this:
:'''Sansa:''' Goo-Goo-Good Evening, la&mdash;la&mdash;ladies and... and... and...
:'''Sansa:''' ...*sigh* I still can't do it. As soon it's a performance, my stammer just gets out of control...
:{{DIcon}} Seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
::'''Sansa:''' Someone who looks like you? ...Yes! I do believe I have!
::'''Sansa:''' Now, where was it...
::'''Sansa:''' Ah yes! I remember! It was when I was a child. That was my favorite picture book, that was... the protagonist had beautiful blonde hair, just like you!
::'''Sansa:''' Oh&mdash; Looking for a [[Traveler's Sibling|relative]]? I'm sorry, I... I misunderstood.
::'''Sansa:''' I've never seen anyone that looks like you in real life, no. As it happens, you have a very distinctive appearance &mdash; so, I'll keep a look out!
:{{DIcon}} Stammer?
::'''Sansa:''' I'm practicing for my first-ever performance. But I'm so nervous!
::'''Sansa:''' I can speak fine normally. But as soon as I'm aware that I'm performing, I get all tense and tongue-tied...
::'''Sansa:''' But I've always dreamed of doing this. I've gotta keep trying!
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about your dream.
:::'''Sansa:''' My parents were extremely resistant to the idea of me being a bard. They said there'd be no job security whatsoever...
:::'''Sansa:''' They were hoping I might be an academic, but my research skills are dire...
:::'''Sansa:''' Those were the days when they'd lock me in my room and force me to study. The only joy I got was from hearing the bards sing outside the window.
:::'''Sansa:''' That got me interested, and then after I grew up I just wanted to be a bard. Even if it meant falling out with my parents. I had to give it a try!
:::'''Sansa:''' This is the path I've chosen, and I'll find a way round any obstacles in my way... Even the stammer. I know I can do it!
:{{DIcon}} Best of luck to you.
::'''Sansa:''' Thank you. One day, I'll become a legendary bard of Mondstadt... One day!
::'''Sansa:''' ...Provided that I can overcome the stammer, of course...

;(After completing To the Winds of Freedom)
:'''Sansa:''' "So swiftly now, stop and rest. Hurry not, do not press"... Oh, it's you. Is there something I can help you with?
:{{DIcon|Drumalong}} I was hoping I could borrow your instrument.
::'''Sansa:''' Please do! I can't wait to hear the melody you'll play.
:;(Opens interface [[Try Out Instrument]])
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about your dream.
::'''Sansa:''' My parents were extremely resistant to the idea of me being a bard. They were hoping I might be an academic, but I've never been the scholarly type...
::'''Sansa:''' Those were the days when they'd lock me in my room and force me to study. The only joy I got was from hearing the bards sing outside the window.
::'''Sansa:''' That got me interested, and then after I grew up, I just wanted to be a bard. Even if it meant falling out with my parents, I had to give it a try!
::'''Sansa:''' Now, thanks to you, I no longer stammer when performing.
::'''Sansa:''' I'll become a legendary bard in Mondstadt... One day!
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen someone who looks very much like me?
::'''Sansa:''' Someone who looks like you? ... Yes! I do believe I have!
::'''Sansa:''' Now, where did I...
::'''Sansa:''' Ah yes! I remember! It was when I was a child. That was my favorite picture book, that was... the protagonist had beautiful blonde hair, just like you!
