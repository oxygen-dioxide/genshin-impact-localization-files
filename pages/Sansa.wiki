==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Sansa's parents did not approve of her wish to become a bard - they believed there was no job security and pushed for her to succeed in academics. They would force her into her room to study, and she found comfort in the bard that played music outside her window. When she made up her mind to become a bard, she apparently had some sort of bad fallout with her parents.

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Sansa wears the standard female bard outfit, which consists of a white blouse and brown skirt covered by a red dress.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sansa:''' Perfect timing. Listen to this:
:'''Sansa:''' Goo-Goo-Good Evening, la&mdash;la&mdash;ladies and... and... and...
:'''Sansa:''' ...*sigh* I still can't do it. As soon it's a performance, my stammer just gets out of control...
:{{DIcon}} Seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
::'''Sansa:''' Someone who looks like you? ...Yes! I do believe I have!
::'''Sansa:''' Now, where was it...
::'''Sansa:''' Ah yes! I remember! It was when I was a child. That was my favorite picture book, that was... the protagonist had beautiful blonde hair, just like you!
::'''Sansa:''' Oh- Looking for a relative? I'm sorry, I... I misunderstood.
::'''Sansa:''' I've never seen anyone that looks like you in real life, no. As it happens, you have a very distinctive appearance &mdash; so, I'll keep a look out!
:{{DIcon}} Stammer?
::'''Sansa:''' I'm practicing for my first-ever performance. But I'm so nervous!
::'''Sansa:''' I can speak fine normally. But as soon as I'm aware that I'm performing, I get all tense and tongue-tied...
::'''Sansa:''' But I've always dreamed of doing this. I've gotta keep trying!
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about your dream.
:::'''Sansa:''' My parents were extremely resistant to the idea of me being a bard. They said there'd be no job security whatsoever...
:::'''Sansa:''' They were hoping I might be an academic, but my research skills are dire...
:::'''Sansa:''' Those were the days when they'd lock me in my room and force me to study. The only joy I got was from hearing the bards sing outside the window.
:::'''Sansa:''' That got me interested, and then after I grew up I just wanted to be a bard. Even if it meant falling out with my parents. I had to give it a try!
:::'''Sansa:''' This is the path I've chosen, and I'll find a way round any obstacles in my way... Even the stammer. I know I can do it!
:{{DIcon}} Best of luck to you.
::'''Sansa:''' Thank you. One day, I'll become a legendary bard of Mondstadt... One day!
::'''Sansa:''' ...Provided that I can overcome the stammer, of course...
