==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tepano:''' Ah, it's so relaxing, what with no one messing about here.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Tepano knows)
:::'''Tepano:''' I heard someone that some solid Magic Crystal Ore had emerged out of nowhere. Our first thought was that it might be [[Ley Line]] troubles, so a whole bunch of people rushed over to check things out.
:::'''Tepano:''' As it turned out, it was just some ordinary ore. Not that having a place to replenish resources is a bad thing, of course. If you wanna have a look, it should be in... this direction.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Tepano knows)
:::'''Tepano:''' Hmm... I can't think of anything worth mentioning, but the scenery is pretty nice.
:{{DIcon}} In a good mood, I see?
::'''Tepano:''' You bet.
:;(Before completing ''[[A Fuel Named "Fate"]]''){{Verify}}
:::'''Tepano:''' Patrolling around the Masters of the Night-Wind is just the easiest thing. These people are either impossible to find or holed up indoors.
:;(After completing ''A Fuel Named "Fate"'')
:::'''Tepano:''' As long as there aren't any large-scale [[Abyss]]al assaults like that one before, patrolling around the Masters of the Night-Wind might just be the easiest thing there is.
:::'''Tepano:''' Now that assault was tough... Thank goodness a whole bunch of friends from outside came to help out.
:::'''Tepano:''' But usually, the people in our tribe are either impossible to find or holed up indoors.
::'''Tepano:''' And the few not-very-intimidating monsters that there are in the area can be easily beaten using pre-prepared [[Phlogiston]] Engravings.
::'''Tepano:''' The main thing I've gotta do is keep reckless outsiders from disturbing the [[Iktomisaur]]s. Get on their bad side and their tempers are no joke, I'll tell you that.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Calming people down requires skill.
:::'''Tepano:''' Very true!
:::'''Tepano:''' Some [[Saurian]]s are just too stubborn. The last time [[Samil|someone]] touched and Iktomisaurus's feathers without permission, they ended up writing a three-page apology!
:::'''Tepano:''' Who knows if the apology even made sense to the Saurian? But I guess that just goes to show the price of acting on impulse, haha.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Teachings of Kindling|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Tepano:''' See you!
