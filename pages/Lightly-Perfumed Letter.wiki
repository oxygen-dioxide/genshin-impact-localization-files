'''Lightly-Perfumed Letter''' is a letter written by [[Hiiragi Chisato]] to the [[Traveler]], asking them to meet her at night.

==Text==
Dear Traveler,<br />
Would that I could convey this message to you in person.<br />
I apologize for the hasty means by which this letter has come to you, and I hope that it hasn't left you feeling perplexed or perturbed in any way.<br />
This is my first time extending an invitation to an unknown outlander, after all.<br />
It is no mere coincidence that our paths have crossed.<br />
Therefore,<br />
I hope that you would be so courteous as to meet me tonight, under the glow of resplendent moonlight.

Please do not fret about retainers and bodyguards, I will ensure that their attention shall be elsewhere.<br />
I look forward to the pleasure of your company.
