{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has never had dim sum at Xinyue Kiosk before, but it should be quite the feast for sure!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, and that's Paimon's stomach, right on cue, telling her it's time to go find Gaming. Let's go!

;(Enter Xinyue Kiosk)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh! You're here early. I just ordered. The food should be out in a second. Sit down, sit down.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's all take a seat.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Here, hand me your cups.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, thank you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Wait! You weren't supposed to drink that, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' That was for you to rinse your utensils.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? That's a thing?
:{{Black Screen|As you talk, piping hot dim sum dishes arrive at the table one after another.}}
:{{Black Screen|And just when you think that all the dishes have been delivered, the hostess brings over a generous bowl of seafood congee...}}

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... So much delicious food. Do you really eat all this just for breakfast?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Hehe, that's just how we do it where I'm from.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Most of the time, though, I don't eat lunch after dim sum.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's good to hear. Paimon doesn't need to worry about holding back, then!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Eat! Eat! If it's not enough, we can always order more. Oh, there's Tong Sui coming as well! I don't usually have that in the morning, but well, since everyone's here, I just had to order it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' What about you, {{Traveler}}? Is the food to your liking? Want some more seafood congee? Let me refill your bowl.
:{{DIcon}} That would be great, thanks.
:{{DIcon}} I'd be happy to do it myself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna take you up on that! Fill it up nice and full, and make sure she gets a few extra shrimp. Thanks!
:{{Black Screen|Everyone picks up their chopsticks and begins to dig in...}}
:{{Black Screen|Each dish tastes exquisite and is uniquely flavorful. You slowly start to relax as you enjoy pleasant conversation over a satisfying meal...}}
:{{Black Screen|This goes on until even Paimon can't eat another bite...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... So full. That meal was so satisfying, it even gave Paimon some extra brain juice.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Listen, listen, Paimon's figured it out!
:{{DIcon}} Figured what out?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's think about this for a second, Gaming. You invited us to this awesome restaurant and ordered a whole tableful of expensive dim sum just for the three of us... Well, you must be hiding the fact that you're some young master from a rich family!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That would explain why you try to keep your friends and family away from each other.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Haha, are you confusing me with Xingqiu?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You know Xingqiu? You sure know a lot of people.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 10.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Well, when you're on the road as much as I am, you hear all sorts of rumors. Sometimes they're true, sometimes they're not. What it comes down to is being able to tell the difference.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 11.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' More often than not, that means knocking on some doors to find out for yourself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you truly are a man of many talents, Young Master Gaming!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 12.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Okay, okay. Enough with the teasing. Sorry to burst your bubble, Paimon, but you're wrong about my family situation.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? Paimon thought she was on to something there...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 13.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' My dad is just an ordinary tea merchant. Small-scale stuff, you know? It wouldn't even make sense to mention his business in the same breath as the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 14.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' My dad... *sigh* He always wanted me to inherit the family business, to be a merchant like him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 15.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' But that's just not who I am. It's not who I ever wanted to be.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Gaming always seems so happy and carefree. This is the most serious I've ever seen him. This topic must be very important to him.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you ever talked to him about it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know... about your interests and aspirations and stuff?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 16.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Of course I have! I told him I wanted to be a Wushou dancer &mdash; that I wanted all of Teyvat to see what I could do!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 17.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' According to my dad, though, that wasn't a real job... Just a child's pipe-dream.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's terrible...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 18.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm sure he thought I would come around eventually, but Wushou dancing has always been the only thing I wanted to do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 19.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' One day, he tried to get me to visit some other tea merchants to start building the right relationships, but I refused to go. We got into a huge fight. We were this close to throwing hands.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 20.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' In the end, I was so angry that I... I ran away from home. I haven't been back since...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 21.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Don't get on my case just yet, okay? It's not like I think I'm completely without fault.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 22.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' No... I know that it wasn't the right way to go about things.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 23.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' But my dad's stubborn. No matter how hard I tried to convince him, it just went in one ear and out the other. There was no changing his mind.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 24.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I knew talking would only get me so far. But if I made it big in Liyue Harbor... The results could speak for themselves...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gaming...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 25.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' But... I'm sure you both already know how that's going. Wushou dancing's just not that big in Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 26.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' In the past, I would go door-to-door from store to store, asking if they would be interested in hiring a performer. Most times, I wound up eating nothing but humble pie, hehe...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 27.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' And you can't just rely on dreams to put food on the table, right? So I found a job as a guard to make some money, and now I have enough to get by and then some!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 28.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...Still, change takes time. Gotta take it slow, you know?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon understands...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 29.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Okay! Enough of all that serious talk! Our tea's getting cold. Let's do something fun this afternoon. What do you say? I'll organize.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually... We... kind of already have plans this afternoon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We told Xianyun that we would go to her kite-making workshop...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 30.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you interested in kite-making, Gaming?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 31.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh, no. It's just that I happen to know Aunty Xianyun.
:{{DIcon}} Aunty Xianyun...
::{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 22a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That title certainly humanizes her a bit...
:{{DIcon}} Aunty is no way to address a mighty and illuminated Adeptus.
::{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 22b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, do you not know who she really is, Gaming?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 32.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh, I know that she's an adeptus. I met her during a delivery once. But hasn't she been in the city lately? She's even tried... with some limited success, to change her terms of self-address, or something like that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 33.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' She came to see me a few days ago to ask about luminescent dyes. Wait a second... She doesn't plan on putting those on a kite, does she?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that not something you can do?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 34.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' It's one thing to use it on cloth. But applying it to paper is another matter entirely. Why couldn't she tell me what she wanted them for...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, she does seem to have trouble with that sometimes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 gaming 35.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' It would be such a shame if everyone worked so hard on their kites only for them to get ruined in the end. Okay, I'll go with you. If Aunty Xianyun wants to use those dyes on a kite, the formula will need to be changed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 2 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! The more the merrier!

;(Approach Ganyu, Shenhe, and Yaoyao on Mt. Aocang)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 01.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Ganyu, Ganyu! C'mon, wake up! Some friends have arrived!
:{{Introductory Note|Yaoyao}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Hello... friends...
:{{Introductory Note|Ganyu}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 02.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Ganyuuu!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I have some mint oil. Perhaps we should try that?
:{{Introductory Note|Shenhe}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' A guest at Wanmin Restaurant recommended it to me. I've tried it. Its stimulative effects are much stronger than what can be achieved from chewing on mint leaves alone.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' *snore* *snore*
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' *sigh*
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...Apologies in advance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 03.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Wait! Shenhe! Not there...!
:{{Black Screen|You see Shenhe take out a small green bottle, extract some minty-smelling liquid, and apply it to Ganyu's horns.}}
:{{Black Screen|Yaoyao and Paimon look on in shock, mouths agape, but cannot stop her in time...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' ...Ahem, ahem! ...Aaah!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' See, it worked. She's awake.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 04.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Are you okay, Ganyu? Do you need some water? Or maybe something to eat?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I&mdash;I'm fine. I just feel... chilly all over... *shiver*....
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Huh. Was it that effective?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 05.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Chilly, huh... Hmm... Master always says, "a cool head leads to a calm heart." So, does this mean that heat's what we need to help you, Ganyu?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't think that's what the expression means, exactly...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Phew... I&mdash;I feel a bit better now...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Was I asleep? Must have been around the time I usually take my midday nap...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Did you not sleep last night? That does seem to happen to you often.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Perhaps you should come work at Wanmin Restaurant with me. We get off at ten on the dot every night without fail.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I&mdash;I could never!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I'm sorry, I seem to have missed your name. You are...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Me? My name is Gaming. I work as a guard for the Secure Transport Agency.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 09.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Gaming... The name sounds familiar. I believe I've heard your name mentioned around the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 10.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' People tell me you're an extremely enthusiastic worker and are very generous with your help.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Eh, well you know me. Or, I guess you don't, haha...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 11.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' My name is Ganyu. This is Shenhe, and this is Yaoyao.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' It's an honor to finally meet you all!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh, you must be here for Aunty Xianyun's kite-making workshop, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 09.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shenhe 10.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I have neither made nor flown a kite before. As long as Master is willing to teach, I am willing to learn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 06.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Me too! I want to participate in the kite-flying competition with my best friend.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 07.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Plus, it's more meaningful if you make the kite yourself, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your best friend didn't come with you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 08.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Well, Qiqi's been super busy helping Dr. Baizhu lately... I'll meet up with her later and give her a huge surprise!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 yaoyao 09.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Oh! I also brought bandages and ointment with me today. It's easy to cut yourself when working with bamboo, so I thought I should come prepared.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Wow, you're really thoughtful!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 12.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' As for myself... I'm afraid I lack some of my companions' enthusiasm.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 13.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I was originally planning to buy a ready-made kite and just enjoy the festive city atmosphere with everyone...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 14.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But Cloud Retainer is always going out of her way to look after her juniors, wanting us to have the best there is &mdash; she always puts us before herself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 15.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' It was so thoughtful of her to arrange this workshop, so I simply couldn't let such consideration go to waste.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 ganyu 16.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' My motivation for being here might be a little different, yes, but I'm ready to put in just as much effort as everyone else!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we're all here. But where the heck is Xianyun? Shouldn't she be here by now?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Who is it that speaks of oneself in such an ill-tempered tone?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, you clearly heard Paimon!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Master stopped to buy Grilled Tiger Fish to share with everyone &mdash; come get it while it's still warm.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's sorry, Miss Illuminated Bird. Paimon always knew you were the smartest, coolest, and prettiest adeptus. Someone as wonderful as you is sure to have brought enough for Paimon as well... right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmph...
:{{Black Screen|Cloud Retainer sets down her bags while Shuyu hands out the grilled fish. As everyone begins to talk, lively conversation fills the usually tranquil environment of Mt. Aocang...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so delicious! Paimon's life is complete...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmm... It appears that we've ended up with quite a few participants indeed. Go ahead and divide yourselves into small groups.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' The materials are over here. The regular dyes and luminescent ones have been clearly marked. Use them as you see fit.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' As for how to make the kite, one assumes you all made sure to listen to the instructions one provided while we were eating, yes? Are there any questions?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon may have focused a little too hard on the eating and less on the listening...
:{{DIcon}} I'll be the one making it anyway.
:{{DIcon}} You can just help out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knew she could count on you, {{Traveler}}!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One will wait under this tree and avail oneself of the cool air while one digests. Do not hesitate to seek one's company if you have any trouble, questions, or simply want to chat.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're not in any hurry to get started. Why don't we go see what the others are up to?

;(Talk to Yaoyao or Xianyun)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 yaoyao 01.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Aunty Cloud Retainer, look! Am I doing it right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Very good. Your frame is nice and sturdy. This design... Is it a finch?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 yaoyao 02.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Yep! ♪ *whistle*~ ♪
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hehe... One is looking forward to seeing your finished product.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What color are you going to make it, Yaoyao?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 yaoyao 03.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' I haven't decided yet. If I make it blue, it'll be more like my friend. But if I make it gold, it'll be more like me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' If you are asking for one's own opinion... One would advise choosing gold.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' When giving a gift, the key consideration is the recipient's feelings, is it not? One imagines your friend would much prefer a kite that reminds them of you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 yaoyao 04.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Hey, I never told you the kite was for Qiqi... How did you know?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' With age comes wisdom, child. One simply has a way of knowing things.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 yaoyao 05.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Cool! Thanks, Aunty Cloud Retainer!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 yaoyao 06.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' I'm gonna start painting it gold right now!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Good. One will watch.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 xianyun 07.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' You two seem strangely unoccupied. One was under the impression that one was supposed to be doing the relaxing. Is your kite finished?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' W&mdash;We actually haven't started yet. But we're going to start... right now!

;(Talk to Yaoyao or Xianyun again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj302 yaoyao 01.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Once I get better at making kites, I'm going to make one shaped like Yuegui.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj302 yaoyao 02.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' You gave him to me, and he's just the best!
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj302 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hehe... One is pleased that you like the gift.

;(Talk to Gaming or Shuyu)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 4 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Hey Gaming, want to team up?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 4 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Huh? I have to participate? I thought I'd be done for the day after adjusting the dye formula.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're that unenthused by kite-making, huh? That doesn't seem like you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 4 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' No, it's not that. It's just...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 4 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' *sigh* It would take too long to explain. I guess I'll just make one then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 4 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' What shape should we go with... How about a butterfly?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The butterfly symbolizes the desire for freedom. Perhaps that's also what Gaming's searching for.)

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Um, Shenhe... It would be great if you could refrain from putting things on my horns from now on. They're really quite sensitive...

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Thank you. No harm done.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Good.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...Could I touch them just once more though? No oil or anything this time. I've just always wondered what Ms. Ganyu's horns feel like.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Huh? Please, I told you, just call me "Ganyu"... *sigh* Well, alright... Just be gentle.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' (Firm to the touch with no discernable temperature, not unlike certain medicinal plants I've eaten before.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' (Still, Ganyu appears to be shaking like a cat whose whiskers have just been touched... I should stop.)

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Then I'll apply the oil to your forehead next time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Oh, no need, I'll just... refrain from taking afternoon naps outdoors.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' *cough* *cough*... Anyway, we should probably get started on our kite. It won't be long before Cloud Retainer comes to check on our progress.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Perhaps... Perhaps we should just choose the most traditional style.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, they seem to be getting along swimmingly. Let's not disturb them.

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' First, we have to decide on the shape... Hey, what are you laughing at?
:{{DIcon}} The obvious answer is to make a Paimon-shaped kite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's not a completely crazy idea.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If nothing else, a Paimon-shaped kite could at least make sure you never get lost on your travels and always find the tastiest food and funnest things to do wherever you go!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe we're not exercising enough artistic license... We should exaggerate this a bit. How about this? The word "Paimon" means... "The Guardian Angel of Travelers"!

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now... what expression should we give her? Since the kite is going to be flying super high in the sky...
:{{DIcon}} She should look pleased with herself...
::{{A|vo eqhdj302 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, like this? "Hahahaha! The title of champion kite-flyer is mine!"
:{{DIcon}} She should look afraid...
::{{A|vo eqhdj302 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "It's too high! Someone save Paimon! She's about to faint!" Like that?
:{{DIcon}} She should look guilty about something...
::{{A|vo eqhdj302 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Ohh, Paimon totally didn't do anything wrong, and even if she did, she doesn't deserve to get shot up into the sky for it..." Something like this, then?
;(After selecting an option)
:{{DIcon}} Yep, that's the one.

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 12 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' No way! You can paint with your eyes closed? Wow, the disciples of adepti really are something!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 12 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' You are most filial, Shenhe. One is flattered by the likeness.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 12 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' The suanni that Gaming and Shuyu made looks very majestic. I'm sure it'll look even more impressive as it soars through the sky.

::{{A|vo eqhdj302 13 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm just admiring the expression you chose. Whether the kite soars high in the air or comes crashing straight to the ground, it's still fitting.

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xueyue 01.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Hmm. This Fontainian device of mechanical motion is quite curious indeed...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 moutainshaper 01.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Now is hardly an opportune time for your musings! Someone among us was not sufficiently attentive, and now the kite has vanished!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xueyue 02.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Calm yourself. Do you have any recollection of its last location?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 moutainshaper 02.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' One believes it drifted in the direction of Mt. Aocang.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 moutainshaper 03.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Perhaps it is mere happenstance, but one feels a certain sense of dread at the thought.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xueyue 03.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Your concern is misplaced, surely.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xueyue 04.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Cloud Retainer is either in the city looking after her disciples or secluded in her abode attending to her research. She will not notice that kite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xueyue 05.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' On the subject of said kite, however, one simply must remark on the genius of its windless lift technology. One cannot help but surmise that its ingenuity rivals that of Cloud Retainer's creations...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 moutainshaper 04.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Still thy tongue! If Cloud Retainer were to hear you profess such a thing, we can both say farewell to any further use of the Supreme Cuisine Machine!

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 moutainshaper 06.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' (Further explanation shall only fan the flames of her wrath. It would be better to stay silent and retire at the earliest opportunity!)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xueyue 09.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' (We can hardly avoid her forever. That may suffice during Lantern Rite, but what about the [[Moonchase Festival]]? Sooner or later, she will discover our true identity.)

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xueyue 12.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' I truly possess no inkling of who could have released a kite into your esteemed demesne. Pray, who could be responsible for such wanton behavior...

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmph. How could one feel anger at the sight of two old friends enjoying themselves? One is also well aware of how enticing these city novelties can be.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 moutainshaper 11.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' *sigh* We were simply consumed by a fit of festive spirit. Seldom do we get the opportunity to partake in the delights of the times.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 moutainshaper 12.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' However, we are far from being as adept as you in matters that require a deftness of hand. No worthy kite could be born of our own making. Thus, we could only take the convenient route, so to speak.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 17 xueyue 14.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Your prowess in mechanics is unparalleled, Cloud Retainer. You wield the wind and waves themselves. Your singular talent stands unmatched across the land... Of this we are well aware.

:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' (Huh!? She asked them just like that...?)
:{{DIcon}} You look great.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You look pretty too, Ganyu. How should Paimon put it? You both look so elegant and refined &mdash; those outfits really suit you both.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Given that one employed the services of the best tailor in all of Liyue, one would expect nothing less.
:;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' What colors have you been partial to lately, Shenhe and Ganyu?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' (Lately? Why is Cloud Retainer suddenly asking about what colors we like?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I like black.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One is gratified to see that one's disciple has inherited one's own tastes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' (The color black doesn't get dirty easily &mdash; a virtue I've come to value recently.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' And you, Ganyu?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I favor blue and black.
:;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' And the material is sufficiently comfortable, yes?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Yes, very. I simply cannot thank you enough, Cloud Retainer &mdash; for this gift, and the kite, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Thank you, Master.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One is content as long as you are pleased with the gift. One hopes these garments will see much use.
:{{Black Screen|You sit down and enjoy a tableful of delicious food and pleasant company...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like your [[Supreme Cuisine Machine]] is just getting better and better, Xianyun!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This Golden Crab's particularly good. The shell's deliciously crunchy, and the meat inside is so succulent and sweet. Hehe, Paimon can't stop eating!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a good thing Gaming isn't here or Paimon would have to have to duel him for the food &mdash; y'know, with chopsticks!
:{{DIcon}} It would be a close match.
:{{DIcon}} You'd trounce him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 07.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' He traveled all this way on account of the kite-making workshop, and he spent the whole afternoon looking after Shuyu... One was hoping to treat him to a meal.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 08.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Oh well... One will just have to extend one's thanks in person.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' It's rare for someone to make such a good impression on you, Cloud Retainer.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 09.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hah. One has high standards.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 10.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' He appears to be a young man of much merit, and one is not the type who would see such potential squandered.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' It appears that he wishes to break free from the kite string that tethers him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 11.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Kite string? What strange metaphors you speak in, Shenhe. Ever since you returned from Wanmin Restaurant, your turns of phrase render one at quite the loss.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where do we even begin... Oh, do you know about the conflict between Gaming and his dad, Xianyun?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 12.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has only heard that the two are not on good terms...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He ran away from home and hasn't been back since!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 13.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Ran away, you say? One believes we would all benefit from a more thorough retelling. Start from the beginning.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, okay. Paimon just hopes he won't mind...
:{{Black Screen|Paimon tells Cloud Retainer everything she knows about Gaming's family situation...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...What?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 14.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' This shall not do!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 15.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Lantern Rite fast approaches. We must make haste.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 16.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' As one was contacting various tailors around Liyue, one could not help but be reminded of [[Menogias]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 17.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' He possessed a singular talent for clothing design. He had an exquisite eye not just for fabric selection and color pairing, but also for what accessories could best accentuate a garment's overall styling.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 18.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' At a gathering of adepti, [[Bonanus]] once complained in secret to some of the ladies in attendance that the skirt Menogias made for her was too long and impractical, lamenting that it would only hinder her in battle.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 19.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' However, when one asked Menogias his opinion, he remarked that the train of the skirt would serve to enhance her adeptal countenance by exemplifying a certain elegance. Menogias was that type of person. When it came to topics relating to garments and accessories, not even Rex Lapis could best his stubbornness.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 20.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' And later...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 21.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Ah, one seems to have strayed off-topic.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 22.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One means to say that Lantern Rite should be a day of reunion.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 23.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' It is a time to address problems before they turn into regrets.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 24.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Fate is fickle. The cruel reality of this world is that suffering and misfortune can befall any of us without design or reason. If there is a chance for young people to remain insulated from this reality, one should do one's utmost to make it so.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's nice and all, but...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Do you have any ideas, Cloud Retainer?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 25.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Perhaps adeptal arts could be of use? No, no... mechanics, perhaps? Hmm, one fails to see its use in a situation such as this...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...Is there anything I can do to help?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 26.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 27.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Combining our efforts... is a fine idea indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 28.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Aha! One has an idea...
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 29.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' How about this...
:;(Xianyun discusses her plans with the others)
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 30.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Does that make sense to everyone?
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! Paimon really hopes this works!
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 31.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmph, one's designs never fail.
:{{A|vo eqhdj302 20 xianyun 32.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Now then, I counsel rest for all, and to make the necessary preparations. One shall see you in two days...
