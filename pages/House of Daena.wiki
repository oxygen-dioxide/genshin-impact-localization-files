==Descriptions==
{{Description|A colossal library that stands at the center of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]]. It was once acknowledged as the bank of all knowledge across the world due to its unparalleled, all-encompassing book collection, but it has now been replaced by the [[Akasha System]]. Nevertheless, this ancient library still stands as a symbol of Sumeru, "the Nation of Wisdom."|[[Map]] description}}

==Lore==
The House of Daena is run by a Grand Conservator, who is in charge of the library's collections. Responsibilities include procuring new material and maintaining the upkeep on the existing collection. Two main candidates for the next Grand Conservator position are [[Vikram]] and [[Rifaet]].

[[Shatir]] calls [[Lisa]] "[[Mondstadt]]'s Grand Conservator" and says that she would have been his first pick for the position had she remained in Sumeru.

==Trivia==
