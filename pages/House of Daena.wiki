{{Location Intro|description=<p>It is the largest library in all of [[Teyvat]], located within [[The Akademiya]] in [[Sumeru City]], [[Sumeru]].</p><!--

--><p>While the rules state that only students and teachers in the Akademiya may borrow books, this does not prevent players from permanently keeping the collectible books inside the House of Daena.</p><!--

--><p>On an elevated platform in the middle of the library is a lift with an Activate prompt. After completing the quest [[Jnagarbha Day]] during [[Chapter III]]: Act V - [[Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises]], the lift can go up to the Grand Sage's office or down to the confinement room.</p>}}

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A colossal library that stands at the center of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]]. It was once acknowledged as the bank of all knowledge across the world due to its unparalleled, all-encompassing book collection, but it has now been replaced by the [[Akasha System]]. Nevertheless, this ancient library still stands as a symbol of Sumeru, "the Nation of Wisdom."|[[Map]] description}}

==Lore==
The House of Daena is run by a Grand Conservator, who is in charge of the library's collections. Responsibilities include procuring new material and maintaining the upkeep on the existing collection. Two main candidates for the next Grand Conservator position are [[Vikram]] and [[Rifaet]].

[[Shatir]] calls [[Lisa]] "[[Mondstadt]]'s Grand Conservator" and says that she would have been his first pick for the position had she remained in Sumeru.
