:'''Masose:''' Oh no, Itsaho, there's still so much missing from the list... H&mdash;Help me look for them, would you?
:'''Itsaho:''' *sigh*... Don't waste your time. I already checked. Most of them were fragile goods. Do you really think any of them are still in one piece after the eruption and the crash?
:'''Itsaho:''' Save your energy and take a break. We've got a long road ahead of us once the boss and the others get back.
:'''Masose:''' N&mdash;No way! F&mdash;Fine, if you're not going, I'll just go myself...
