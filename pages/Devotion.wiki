'''Devotion''' is [[Noelle]]'s [[1st Ascension Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The shield has a slight delay before being applied. Thus, the damage triggering the shield is not reduced.
** If the damage killed the character from above 30% HP, the shield won't be triggered.
** If the active character HP is already below 30% and takes damage that kills the character, the shield will be triggered and wasted. <!-- How to test this? Simple, kill a character by falling, revive with egg for 150 HP then try to take a hit from boar that deals more than 150 damage. The shield will be triggered but your character died first-->
* The shield cannot be passed to other characters.
* The shield persists when switched back to the character if the shield has not yet expired.
* The shield is separate from other shields and thus takes damage together just like the normal shield stacking rules.
