==Profile==
After Timmie's father left some time ago and never returned, [[Grace]] has been taking care of Timmie. While she is not biologically related to him, he considers her his mother. Because she also looks after [[Glory]] and [[Nora]], Timmie worries about troubling her too much.

Unbeknownst to Timmie, his father died from a hunting accident. [[Draff]], his good friend, brought him to Grace as quickly as possible, but they were too late to save him. Unable to bring themselves to tell Timmie the truth at the time, they agreed to have Grace take care of Timmie while Draff returned to Springvale, sending money and a letter to Timmie every once in a while.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Boy's Letter}}</ref>

===Personality===
Timmie has trouble fitting in with his peers in the city and stays to himself, caring for the pigeons. He is extremely protective of them and holds them in unusually high regard, believing [[Dvalin]] to be an incarnation of pigeons taking revenge on those who scare them and creating an imaginary friend [[Ruin Guard]] with dreams of using it to protect them.

He loves animals in general, as while he does not like the ducks for intruding and taking the pigeons' food, he understands that they are hungry and has the Traveler place food for them away from the pigeons as part of his [[Pigeon, Duck, and Child|commission]]. If the Traveler kills the ducks, he becomes horrified at their actions.

===Appearance===
Timmie is a young boy with pale skin, blue eyes, and short dirty blonde hair.

==Trivia==
* Timmie will still remark on you scaring away the pigeons, regardless of whether there were any pigeons there to begin with, or if you haven't scared the pigeons due to talents (e.g. having Aloy in the party).
* Timmie's imaginary friend is a Ruin Guard that can kill the people who try to scare his pigeons away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Child's Secret}}</ref>
* Timmie is mentioned in the ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' and ''Genshin Impact'' crossover event "Outworld Traveler". During the quest, when the player's party arrives at the bridge outside of the [[City of Mondstadt]], they are surprised that Timmie is absent.
* On [[Twinning Isle/2.8|Twinning Isle]] during the [[Summertime Odyssey]] event, The Peristerophile Night Raven is the "Immernachtreich's" counterpart of Timmie as it yells at the player for scaring away the pigeons as well.
