{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tusheng:''' Let's go with some fruit today... Hmm, no. Even in that, we should have variety...
:{{DIcon}} Yes? What's on the menu today?
::'''Tusheng:''' Today it's... Oh, it's you. I thought it was that [[Wenhua|old fogey]]. Seriously, what's his problem, shouting all the time at his age? My poor ears...
::'''Tusheng:''' Well, anyway. I've prepared some [[Sunsettia]] and [[Berry]] slices mixed in [[Sweet Flower]] juice, along with some minced Berries and [[Mint]]s...
::{{DIcon}} ...Wow, you're making me hungry already.
::'''Tusheng:''' That won't come cheap, you know! The ingredients I use are all fresh as can be.
::'''Tusheng:''' That old fogey's a miser and wouldn't listen to anyone to save his life... But he's generous enough when it comes to the Sumpter Beasts.
::'''Tusheng:''' Hmph, not that this would ever lead to me getting a raise, though.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Tusheng:''' See you. I'll be off to feed the Sumpter Beasts, then.
