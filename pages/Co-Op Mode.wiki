'''Co-Op Mode''' is unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 16. In Co-Op Mode, a [[Party]] of up to four Travelers can adventure simultaneously and take on [[Domains]] and monsters, find treasure, and enjoy the world of [[Teyvat]] together.

Cross-play between the PC, Mobile (iOS and Android), and PSN platforms is possible as long as the players are on the same regional server (NA, EU, Asia, or SAR).

The Co-Op Menu can be access at the {{Icon|customfile=Ui co-op.png|20px}} icon in the user interface and the [[Paimon Menu]].

Completion of the Archon Quest [[Prologue]]: Act I - [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]] is also required to unlock Co-Op.

==Rules and Restrictions==
Restrictions for starting Co-Op Mode:

*Players can only join worlds of players whose World Level and Adventure Rank ("AR") range is lower than or equal to their own.
**In the case of the [[Serenitea Pot]], players can join their Friends' Serenitea Pot regardless of either one's World Level or AR.
*If an [[Archon Quest]] or [[Story Quest]], or any quest that manipulates the world, is currently in progress, the player cannot participate in Co-Op. (Certain quests may temporarily re-enable Co-Op Mode in between steps.)
**If a quest is currently manipulating a host, and the host just finished, it will take a bit of time before they can be joined. The host can log out and back in to speed up the process.
**While Co-Op Mode is deactivated, any activity that requires entering the Co-Op screen &mdash; even if it can be played solo &mdash; cannot be started until Co-Op Mode is reactivated. (For example, the Fading Star challenge during [[Unreconciled Stars]] and Frostborn Miracle during [[The Chalk Prince and the Dragon]].)

Rules during Co-Op Mode:

*If two players Co-Op together, each of them can choose two characters for the party and swap between them in combat like they can in solo. If three players Co-Op together, the host gets two characters while the others get one. With four players in Co-Op, each player gets one character to use in battle.
**Players can change their fielded character(s) through the Party Setup menu while not in combat.
**It is possible for players to have the same character when outside of Domains, but not in Domains.
*Enemies and enemy variation types scale with the number of players currently in the world.

While not a game rule, it is generally considered impolite to take time-gated resources; such as certain ores, fishes, plants or other wildlife; without the host's permission. Some players refer to this as ''stealing''.

==Activities==
===Co-Op Activities===
Activities that players '''can''' carry out in Co-Op:
*[[Domains]] and [[Ley Line Outcrops]] (although they must be initiated by the host).
**When entering [[Domains]] (dungeons), characters within the party must be unique.
**After completing [[Ley Line Outcrops]], Domains, or [[bosses|boss]] challenges, each player may choose to revitalize the [[Petrified Tree]] or [[Ley Line Blossom]] by using [[Original Resin]] to receive individual rewards.
*[[Commissions]]
**A player can only receive rewards for up to 4 commissions, regardless of whether the commissions were completed solo in their own world or in Co-Op with other players.
**Certain commissions cannot be progressed while in Co-Op Mode. See page for more information.
*[[World Quests]], excluding Adventure Rank Ascension quests.

**Some resources can be collected by all players in a Co-Op session, such as ore (excluding [[Cor Lapis]]) and dropped loot from [[Common Enemies]] and [[Elite Enemies]].

*Some Character [[Talents]] will affect Co-Op partners' characters. These include:
**The [[Healing]] abilities of characters, including but not limited to [[Barbara]], [[Bennett]], [[Diona]] and [[Jean]].

**The "[[Unswerving]]" achievement and a [[Chests#Luxurious|Luxurious Chest]] at the Heart Island east of [[Yaoguang Shoal]] (north of [[Guyun Stone Forest]]) can only be obtained with Co-Op Mode. To reach this island, go north from the [[Geo Hypostasis]] and activate the clover pinwheel in order to glide to this island.
**The achievement "[[Temari for Life]]", which requires hosting a game of [[Temari]].
**The achievement [["Call Me Ishmael."]], which requires catching a fish in another player's world.
*Certain events, like [[Rhodeia's Rage]] and [[The Chalk Prince and the Dragon]]'s [[Resurgent Cryo Regisvine]], require entering "Special Event Mode", which automatically switches the world to Co-Op. This will not match you with other players, but by having "Allow Direct Join" enabled, some players will be able to join and play along with you.

*Certain events, such as [[Contending Tides]], can only be completed in single-player mode.

*Gain the other player party character's passive abilities (for example, [[Razor]]'s sprint stamina passive, [[Ningguang]]'s mining outcrop spotting passive, and [[Tartaglia]]'s [[Master of Weaponry]] will not apply for the other player).
** This also applies to constellations, including [[Rite of Resurrection]] and [[Dedicating Everything to You]].
