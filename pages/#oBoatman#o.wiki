==Profile==
True to his name, he is a supernatural spirit more specifically a psychopomp, responsible for sending dead souls to the afterlife. He will give hints to the players so that they can assist him in persuading the souls of the islanders to let go of their attachment to the life and accept leaving the island. Although the Traveler sees him as a spirit, other souls see him as a man dressed in a golden outfit and possessing a splendid silver boat.
