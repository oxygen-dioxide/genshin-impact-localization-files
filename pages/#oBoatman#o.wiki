==Profile==
The "Boatman" is a supernatural spirit, specifically a psychopomp, responsible for ferrying dead souls to the afterlife aboard his silver boat. He will appear once the fog and time loop curse at Tsurumi Island is resolved to bring the souls of the islanders towards what he describes as "the moon-mansion that golden burns."<ref>{{Ref/HEO|"Boatman"'s Task}}</ref> However, he is stumped that some of the souls still have their lingering attachment and will not board his boat. He will give hints to the [[Traveler]] so that they can assist him in persuading the souls of Tsurumi islanders to let go of their attachment to life and accept leaving the island.
===Personality===
The "Boatman" speaks specifically in song and rhymes. He constantly urges the lingering souls to come aboard his boat so he may ferry them, though his impatience may stem from his worry towards displeasing "the lady of the golden hall," whom he seems to serve.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|"Boatman"'s Task}}</ref> It is implied by the soul of the islanders that he often talks to them and even try to help them finish their unresolved business, though to varying degree of success.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Ipe's Fishing Advice}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/HEO|Nonno's Hide And Seek}}</ref>
===Appearance===
To the Traveler, the "Boatman" appears just like any other spirits, floating light blue translucent figure with a glowing white core. However, other souls on Tsurumi Island see him as a man dressed in a golden outfit and possessing a splendid silver boat. [[Una]] specifically describes him wearing golden fur clothes, long gold pants, with a crown of gold silk on his head.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Una's Longing}}</ref>
