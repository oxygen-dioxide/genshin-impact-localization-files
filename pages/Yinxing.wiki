::'''Yinxing:''' I'm the ship's doctor. Seasickness, wind chills, amputations, I do them all around here.
::'''Yinxing:''' You can have full confidence in my skills. If there's anything at all, you can come to me!
:{{DIcon}} On my... back?
::'''Yinxing:''' Oh! I'm sorry!
::'''Yinxing:''' I... when we dock at [[Liyue Harbor]], I often take care of injured cats and the like.
::'''Yinxing:''' Over time, I've started talking to people in the same way. Please don't take offense.
::'''Yinxing:''' Now that I mention it, I left some small stray kittens in the hands of a [[Millelith]] soldier named [[Yong'an]] the last time, I wonder how they're doing now...
