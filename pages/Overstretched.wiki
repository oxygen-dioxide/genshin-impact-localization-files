{{Quest Description|Millelith [[Qiaoxi]] is tasked with guarding a major thoroughfare to [[Dihua Marsh]]. But he thinks this mammoth task is too much for one person...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talking to Qiaoxi)
:'''Qiaoxi:''' I can't cope...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Qiaoxi:''' Hmm? Who goes there? All who wish to cross this bridge are subject to interrogation, those are the rules.
:'''Qiaoxi:''' That said... Just look at what you're wearing! You're definitely not someone I need to worry about...
:'''Qiaoxi:''' Why? Think about it &mdash; criminals would want to dress as discreetly as possible, no? You, on the other hand, are dressed most ostentatiously indeed.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
:'''Qiaoxi:''' I am the Millelith responsible for this zone. This is a major thoroughfare to Dihua Marsh. Merchants and tourists all pass this way, so I'm stationed here to stand guard.
:'''Qiaoxi:''' But this zone is much too big for one person. Just the other day, I discovered a group of monsters nearby...
:'''Qiaoxi:''' It appears they've set up a camp, and although they haven't made a move yet it's definitely a safety risk. I need to keep an eye on them.
:'''Qiaoxi:''' I'd happily go and clear them out &mdash; except, I worry that if I left my post here, some other monsters would seize the chance to ambush passers-by. I feel so helpless, stuck here all day...
:'''Qiaoxi:''' Can you go and sort out the monsters over there for me? It would free me up to concentrate on other matters...
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Okay.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' You have my thanks. I'll stay here and keep watch to stop anyone from taking a wrong turn and ending up deep in Dihua Marsh...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I'm busy.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' Oh? No big deal, I'll work something out. With any luck, the higher-ups will send some backup within the next few days...
:;(Cancel quest)
----
;(Returning to Qiaoxi)
:'''Qiaoxi:''' How is it coming along?
:{{DIcon}} I have dealt with the monsters.
:'''Qiaoxi:''' Thank you, it's a huge help. I am sorry I had to ask you &mdash; it should have been my job, but you ended up doing it all for me...
:'''Qiaoxi:''' ...There's no point you trying to play it down, you're covered in dust, which I'm sure is from a tooth-and-nail battle with the monsters.
:'''Qiaoxi:''' Ugh, I don't know what the higher-ups are thinking, they really should have sent some more people by now. This zone is far too big for only one person...
:'''Qiaoxi:''' It may be just a couple of bridges, but so much human traffic comes through here every day. If anything were to happen here, it would be catastrophic...
:'''Qiaoxi:''' The higher-ups will be getting a full report on this situation as soon as I have the opportunity.
:'''Qiaoxi:''' You have my thanks. Please take these for your trouble.
