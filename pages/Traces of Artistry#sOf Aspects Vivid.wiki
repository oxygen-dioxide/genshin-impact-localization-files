===Children of Echoes===
{|class="article-table
!Title
!Description
|-
|Statue of the Seven: Tequemecan Valley
|A Statue of The Seven located in Tequemecan Valley.<br>For those traveling from Sumeru, the shortest route to Natlan's Stadium of the Sacred Flame passes through this area. This magnificent rift valley makes the scenery here uniquely spectacular.
|-
|Viewpoint: Children of Echoes
|A tribe that dwells within the canyons. Huge drill-shaped objects and vibrant stages are the hallmarks of the Children of Echoes. When it comes to color, the sights that you'll encounter on a stroll through their domain will provide a nearly endless source of inspiration...
|-
|Harvestable: Saurian Claw Succulent
|A succulent shaped like the paw of a great animal.<br>It is said that there was a time when the plants that grew here could shapeshift at will, almost as if they were some kind of enigmatic dragons. Some would appear poisonous or dangerous in other ways to avoid being eaten by herbivores.<br>The dramatic "linework" exhibited in the form of these plants is full of tension...
|-
|Photograph: Tepetlisaur Whelp
|A Saurian with a drill-like horn and strong claws that can tunnel through rocks and solid phlogiston.<br>Many young Tepetlisaurs have lively, energetic personalities, and as such, make great companions for the Children of Echoes. Their form consists of a mix of strong curves and rocky angles, making them worthy subjects for close observation...
|-
|Photograph: Long-Necked Rhino
|A beast with a massive body and a particularly long, slender neck, it is like a "walking tree," and found only in Natlan.<br>If you were looking to depict a gigantic and visually intimidating creature, the Long-Necked Rhino would clearly be an excellent place to start...
|}

===Scions of the Canopy===
{|class="article-table
!Title
!Description
|-
|Statue of The Seven: Coatepec Mountain
|A Statue of The Seven located in Coatepec Mountain.<br>The terrain in this area is rugged, with sheer cliffs looming up to form towering walls of rock. You can enjoy breathtaking views of Natlan's stunning landscapes from this spot.
|-
|Viewpoint: Scions of the Canopy
|A tribe that resides on lofty clifftops. Most of its members are passionate about extreme sports and are in their element standing proudly at the top of mountain peaks and high precipices. By racing along their extreme routes and gazing out at Natlan's dazzling sights from far above, you will gain a true appreciation for the unique landscapes of the Nation of Pyro...
|-
|Harvestable: Quenepa Berry
|Bluish, juicy berries that grow in large amounts near the Scions of the Canopy. Their shape is similar to that of Flamegranates.<br>The Quenepa Berry's unique color can serve as a reference point when mixing paints, facilitating the creation of the kind of bright, contrasting blocks of color that work so well in graffiti art...
|-
|Photograph: Yumkasaur Whelp
|A Saurian with powerful hind legs and a fluffy tail, capable of spitting Flamegranate pectin hidden in their cheek pouches out, wrapping around distant objects.<br>When they're enjoying their free time, the vast majority of juvenile Yumkasaurs are obedient and sweet-natured, making them ideal neighbors and companions for the Scions of the Canopy. Their distinctive greenish hue is well worth close observation...
|-
|Photograph: Capybara
|These herbivores, which often dwell close to the water, are famous for their steely, stoic "won't even twitch if lightning strikes right next to their toes" disposition. Tourists consider them to be the paragon of animal friends.<br>Due to the Capybara's unique temperament, they are often chosen as subjects by those seeking to depict "still animals"...

===People of the Springs===
{|class="article-table
!Title
!Description
|-
|Statue of The Seven: Toyac Springs
|A Statue of The Seven located in Toyac Springs.<br>In this place, glowing phlogiston mingles with steam from the hot springs, creating a dynamic clash of red and blue. If you were looking for a natural source of color inspiration, this would be a great place to start!
|-
|Viewpoint: People of the Springs
|A tribe that lives a leisurely life surrounded by hot springs and waterside vistas, the "People of the Springs" has nearly become a byword for tourist holidays. When you're taking a break from all that relaxing and you're not busy befriending Koholasaurs, you can capture lines taut with tension by zipping round the Spiritways...
|-
|Harvestable: Sprayfeather Gill
|A special feather-shaped species of plant that grows by the seaside. It looks kind of like a seagrass but is in truth a soft-bodied aquatic coral with a unique shape.<br>Feather-shaped color outlines are frequently employed in graffiti art. Apparently, many beginners hone their drawing skills by tracing these when they first start practicing...
|-
|Photograph: Koholasaur Whelp
|A Saurian with thick, strong flippers and a long tail that can swim in water and liquid phlogiston.<br>In the relaxed, laid-back atmosphere that prevails along the shore, young Koholasaurs may seem kinda dumb, but they are actually intelligent, gentle, and full of curiosity for the world around them, and their presence never fails to bring joy and laughter to the People of the Springs. The elegant curves of their bodies make them worthy subjects for closer observation...
|-
|Photograph: Flowcurrent Bird
|A peculiar bird that can walk on two feet yet cannot spread its wings to fly. Lively and friendly, they are often found in habitats close to water in groups, or floating on their backs in the water without a care in the world.<br>There is something very "down-to-earth" about the dynamics and contours of this flightless creature. By familiarizing yourself with this aspect of its nature, you will surely be able to capture this quality in your own graffiti, and thereby meet specific visual requirements...
