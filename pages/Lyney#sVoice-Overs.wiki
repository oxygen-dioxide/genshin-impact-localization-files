Oh, you're curious how I appeared in front of you like this? Well... Hmm, your eyes are like topaz, precious, pure, and lovely. I like them!

This is what we call self-defense! I mean, sure, I don't mind telling some small lies to others at times, but between the two of us, I've never done anything worse than omitting a minor detail here and there, right?

|vo_07_01_tx         = If a magician were to go onstage with their Vision in hand, people might suspect the authenticity of their tricks, so I habitually take it off before performing. But since you're interested, why don't you help me hold on to it while I perform? Just be sure to keep an eye on it, though &mdash; or it might just sneak its way back to me!

|vo_07_02_tx         = Magic isn't just a performance art, it's also a way of thinking. Many things in this world seem simple at first glance but play host to all sorts of secrets if you look deeper.

|vo_07_03_tx         = Cats can use their ears to express their feelings. If they flatten them backwards, it indicates fear or caution, and if their ears are perked up and occasionally face forward, that usually means they're happy. Constant swiveling indicates that they are vigilantly assessing their surroundings... How do I know this? Experience and observation!

If you're lucky, she might have a great deal of things to say to you. Hmm, and if you're not lucky...? Well, she'll just stare for a while, but hey, at least you'll get to see a different side of her!

|vo_08_04_tx         = My sister and I have always been inseparable. There's no hardship we can't overcome as long as we're together, and similarly, we share all our joys with each other. There's nothing in the world I treasure more than my family, so I know what it must be like for you... And if I find out anything at all that might help you, I'll be sure to let you know.

|vo_08_06_tx         = Monsieur Neuvillette rarely appears in public, almost as if he's intentionally trying to put some distance between himself and the people. At first, I thought it might be just me, but my ever-observant sister noticed it too, so I suppose that must really be the case.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Neuvillette, Lynette

|vo_08_07_tx         = The Hydro Archon, Lady Furina, is very unpredictable, and her manner of speech can be quite provocative, almost as if she sees talking itself like some sort of performance. The people of [[Fontaine]] have a particular soft spot for excitement and drama, which is why many hold her in high esteem.

|vo_08_10_tx         = Charlotte has been trying to get me to agree to an interview ever since we met... Ugh, it feels like she's already asked twenty times now. She has a good nose for finding news, and she's the persistent type, too. But to be honest, I have no desire to find myself in the spotlight of one of her breaking news stories, and so I've found all sorts of reasons to decline each time.

|vo_08_11_tx         = Clorinde's quite famous as a [[Champion Duelist]]. But from what I've read in the papers, she seems to have gotten into a bit of a pickle. The media's been all over her story, and she's... Well, she's the type that definitely doesn't enjoy that kind of attention.

The way I see it, the point is not to perform perfectly, but to stay calm at all times and adapt as needed. Even if some small flaws occur, you just need to make the audience believe that it's all part of the show, and you'll still deliver an entertaining and unforgettable performance!

I'll never need to worry about you getting duped by someone else. But on the other hand, since you've taken it upon yourself to watch my every move, you'd better be careful when you blink...
