{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Idle}} ...You buying or not?
::{{A|VO Jifang 01.ogg}} "So, are you buying or not?"
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jifang:''' Found one you like? Please pay over here.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'm looking to buy some books.
::'''Jifang:''' Pick them out yourself. When you find one you like, pay here.
:;(Opens [[Wanwen Bookhouse]] shop)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Jifang/Legend of the Divine Sword|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Jifang:''' Hmph, that's what I think about when nobody's buying books. I won't let you win that easily.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Jifang:''' How could this be...
:{{DIcon}} I want to know about the Wanwen Bookhouse.
::'''Jifang:''' Strange, most people who come here are looking for books, not the bookhouse itself...
::'''Jifang:''' Anyway, my husband is the one with a bit of a thing for collecting old books. But he doesn't earn any money...
::'''Jifang:''' That's why I opened this place. Got to make a living somehow.
:{{DIcon}} Any recommended reads?
::'''Jifang:''' Let's see... If you like poetry, [[Humor From Tianheng]] is selling well at the moment. Seems to have a mass appeal.
::'''Jifang:''' If you're a visitor in town, you might enjoy [[Records of Jueyun]]. It's not for the faint-hearted, tough.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} "Records of Jueyun"?
:::'''Jifang:''' You seem like you could handle it. See what you think of this one: Records of Jueyun - Stone Beasts.
:::'''Jifang:''' Take it with you if you want. Just bring it back when you get sick of it.
:::'''Jifang:''' ...I won't hold my breath, though, I've had plenty of customers who borrow books and don't return them.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Records of Jueyun|20|text=Records of Jueyun - Vol. I, Stone Beasts|type=Book}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Jifang:''' Typical. You sit there reading the book in-store, then as soon as I ask if you want to buy it you're all, "Oh, I'm just browsing" and "Oh, I might come back tomorrow..."

==Event Dialogue==
===Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} {{Color|help|We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.}}
::'''Jifang:''' A music festival, you say? You know, I actually met my husband because of a song. Quite the coincidence, eh?
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh! Which song was it? Bet we can play it for you &mdash; we're super serious about music!
::'''Jifang:''' Oh, in that case, could you play it if I were to hum the tune?
::{{DIcon}} Sure, I'll give it a go.
::'''Jifang:''' Haha, how exciting!

;(After performing)
:'''Jifang:''' What a wonderfully nostalgic feeling. I was immediately reminded of my studies in Fontaine.
:'''Jifang:''' I would often go to cafes in Vasari Passage to read, and when I heard this song one day, I asked the barista what it was called.
:'''Jifang:''' They didn't know, but a large fellow having some cake nearby told me that it was named "Le Souvenir avec le crepuscule." And yeah, later on, he became my husband.
:'''Jifang:''' He was at the cafe meeting with his friends from a literary club back then. Ah, how nostalgic. We were all so young!
:'''Jifang:''' Oh, right! Your music festival... I fear I shan't be able to attend, but if needed, I can get my husband to go.
:'''Jifang:''' He's been fiddling with some old books that haven't been selling well all day, and I haven't been able to dissuade him from doing so.
:'''Jifang:''' But I'm sure such cultural exchanges would interest him. I'll ask him to bring some souvenirs along that he can give out to boot.

;(Talk to Jifang again, optional)
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} How was that?
:;(Same as ''After performing'')
