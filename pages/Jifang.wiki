==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jifang:''' Found one you like? Please pay over here.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'm looking to buy some books.
::'''Jifang:''' Pick them out yourself. When you find one you like, pay here.

:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Jifang/Legend of the Divine Sword|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Jifang:''' Hmph, that's what I think about when nobody's buying books. I won't let you win that easily.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Jifang:''' How could this be...
:{{DIcon}} I want to know about the Wanwen Bookhouse.
::'''Jifang:''' Strange, most people who come here are looking for books, not the bookhouse itself...
::'''Jifang:''' Anyway, my husband is the one with a bit of a thing for collecting old books. But he doesn't earn any money...
::'''Jifang:''' That's why I opened this place. Got to make a living somehow.
:{{DIcon}} Any recommended reads?
::'''Jifang:''' Let's see... If you like poetry, [[Humor From Tianheng]] is selling well at the moment. Seems to have a mass appeal.
::'''Jifang:''' If you're a visitor in town, you might enjoy [[Records of Jueyun]]. It's not for the faint-hearted, tough.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} "Records of Jueyun"?
:::'''Jifang:''' You seem like you could handle it. See what you think of this one: Records of Jueyun - Stone Beasts.
:::'''Jifang:''' Take it with you if you want. Just bring it back when you get sick of it.
:::'''Jifang:''' ...I won't hold my breath, though. I've had plenty of customers who borrow books and don't return them.
::;(Obtain [[Records of Jueyun]] - Vol. I, Stone Beasts)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Jifang:''' Typical. You sit there reading the book in-store, then as soon as I ask if you want to buy it you're all, "Oh, I'm just browsing" and "Oh, I might come back tomorrow..."
