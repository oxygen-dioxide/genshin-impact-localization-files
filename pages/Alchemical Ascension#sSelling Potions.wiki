;Selling Potions
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Selling Potions 1.png
|text1  = Potions you have concocted must be stocked before they can be sold ({{Color|BP|Potions with exactly identical efficacy cannot be stocked for sale at the same time}}). {{Color|BP|Market News}} is a guide to selling potions: The more the efficacies and characteristics of your potions can fulfill market demands, the greater your {{Color|BP|sales volume}} will be and thus the greater your revenue.<br>During each operation cycle, Paimon will help {{Color|BP|record potion efficacies and characteristics that are in demand}}. If you discover a potion with efficacies and characteristics that are even more suited to the current market, Paimon will update the record.
|image2 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Selling Potions 2.png
|text2  = When each operation cycle ends, your potion sales will be totaled up, with the financial assessment based on sales volume. Check your financial report to see if your potions are in tune with the market demand.

;Custom Orders
{{Tutorial

;Distributors
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Distributors 1.png
|text1  = While the shop is operating, potion distributors who can help sell potions may drop in. These distributors will have clear requests for the {{Color|BP|efficacy and amounts}} of potions they want.<br>Develop a distribution strategy with them and select {{Color|BP|two advantageous strategies}} out of several to gain great benefits.<br>{{Color|BP|As these distributors will not change their area of operations, these advantageous strategies will be fixed for each location.}}<br>Analyze their sales and financial statements to see if your business tactics are working.

==Financial Report==
{{Stub|Ratings may be missing, distributor info is missing and possibly wrong}}
The Financial Report at the end of each cycle and after talking to a returning distributor shows:
* A graph comparing the cycle's revenue to that of the previous six cycles'
* Revenue details, which include:
** Revenue for the cycle
*** This number is ''not'' added to total revenue
** Total potion costs
** Operating costs
** Profits, which is what remains of the revenue after subtracting potion and operating costs
*** Profits will never drop below 0, even if the costs exceed the revenue
*** Profits are added to both available funds and total revenue after viewing the Financial Report
* Revenue breakdown, which includes:
** An overall rating of sales
** Sales per potion type, with a thumbs up on the potions that match the market trends
** Commentary from Paimon, Atefeh, or Deyou based on the overall rating

When a cycle's revenue rating reaches Demand Exceeds Supply or Flying Off the Shelves, after closing the Financial Report, sparkles will briefly appear around the cycle and available funds at the top of the screen.

|Long time no see, most reliable Honorary Knight. I heard that you've reinvented yourself once again, this time as Jean and Lisa's "business consultant." Can't say I'm surprised.<br>I've been leading the Cavalry Company on a long-distance training march over the past few days, and just when we arrived back in the neighborhood, a pair of adventurers discovered a band of bandits were taking advantage of the chaos caused by some monsters. So, I ordered some delivery for the Company, a little appetizer before taking care of those troublemakers...<br>I never imagined the meals would come with complementary potions which restored the Knights' strength and reaction times to what they were before the exhausting training. The cleanup operation went surprisingly smoothly.<br>It was only afterward that I learned the potions came from your shop. You're doing well, I see?<br>As the Cavalry Company received your assistance, I naturally must write this letter of thanks.<br>Also, please accept this payment as a token of gratitude from us. I hope that we will have more opportunities for such fruitful cooperation as "colleagues."

After the guards drank them as well, they became even more valiant in driving back the monsters.<br>Soon, I shall lead them in an offensive and restore Aaru Village's tranquility.<br>Should you have time, please, come to our village for a spell.

Ah, such fortuitous fate!<br>The reputation of your alchemical emporium precedes it, praise for it pouring from the lips of all, for it has helped many conquer the conundrums that confounded them! Perhaps this too can be considered a form of "chivalry."<br>I shall recommend your masterpiece to several author friends of mine, and perhaps soon you shall be known by the title of "Grand Master of Elixirs!"
