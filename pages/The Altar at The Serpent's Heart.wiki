'''The Altar at The Serpent's Heart''' is an important location in [[Enkanomiya]] for several quests and for exploration. It is first used in the World Quest [[The Heart of Ouroboros]]. It is used to enter in [[Altar Patterns]] to obtain rewards or advance a quest.

==Altar Patterns==
{{Main|Altar Pattern}}
An Altar Pattern consists of the five unique [[Key Sigil]] types in a circle along with a number associated with each of the five types.

==Procedure==
Enkanomiya must be in [[Evernight]] to use the Altar.

Each Altar Pattern consists of the five [[Key Sigil]] types with an associated number from one to five in the form of dots &mdash; this corresponds to the blue panels at the altar. The player must enter each panel in the order of those numbers. After successfully applying the pattern to the altar, something will spawn, whether it be a chest, an NPC or enemies that when defeated will spawn a chest.

An Altar Pattern must be activated before the player can successfully enter it in the Altar.

===Details===
As the player enters in an Altar Pattern correctly, the sigil symbols on the panels will light up, and the panels will send the player back to the corresponding symbol in the center of the room.

If the player enters the wrong symbol, the panels stop being lit up, and the player is barely sent back.

After all existing Altar Patterns have been entered, the panels no longer react to the player and can be walked through normally.
