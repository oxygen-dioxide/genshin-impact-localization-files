==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Chauvigne for the first time before starting the Hidden Exploration Objective)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Th&mdash;This wind's way too strong! L&mdash;Let's duck off to the side first, and ignore that little flower inside for now!

;(Approach Panuelle)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Panuelle:''' Ah, my friend...

;(Talk to Panuelle)
:'''Panuelle:''' Just what is Chauvigne thinking? *sigh* He doesn't even want to talk with me.
:{{DIcon}} About Chauvigne...
:'''Panuelle:''' Hello there. I'm really sorry, but... It's Chauvigne. He's still angry at me, and refuses to come out and speak with me.
:'''Panuelle:''' *sigh* But the wind and sunlight can't reach him down there. What if he withers? What then!?
:'''Paimon:''' Uhm... Since we're talking about a potted flower...
:{{DIcon}} We can just scoop him up.
:'''Panuelle:''' I've tried! But as long as Chauvigne's upset, I can't even get close...
:'''Panuelle:''' He's in such a stormy mood that I nearly got blown away!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, how can being angry blow someone away?
:{{DIcon}} That's pretty stormy, alright.
:{{DIcon}} That would make it hard to get close, yes.
:'''Panuelle:''' Maybe the reason he's so furious with me is because I refused to venture out with him before...
:'''Panuelle:''' Please, dear guests, can I trouble you to check on Chauvigne? Perhaps you might even be able to reason with him.
:{{DIcon}} No problem, we'll give it a try.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! We've traveled to so many places, and seen so many people, we'll defin... probably be able to convince him!
:'''Panuelle:''' That's wonderful! You can find him in the cavern below this island. Please, if you'll head that way...
:'''Panuelle:''' I... I must tidy up this place, and find a good place for Chauvigne to soak up some sun.

;(Talk to Panuelle again, optional)
:'''Panuelle:''' I... I must tidy up this place, and find a good place for Chauvigne to soak up some sun.
:'''Panuelle:''' I leave the matter of persuading Chauvigne in your hands, dear guests.
:'''Panuelle:''' If I were to see him, he would surely think me clingy, and become even more tempestuous...
----
;(Approach Chauvigne)
:'''Paimon:''' Waaah! The wind's so strong! So that's what he meant by a stormy mood...
:'''Paimon:''' C&mdash;Calm down! We have something to tell you!

;(Interact with Chauvigne)
:{{DIcon|!}} "Panuelle Sent Us Here!"
:;(The wind stops)

;(Approach Chauvigne)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew... The wind's finally stopped...
:{{DIcon}} Listen to us, please.
:{{DIcon}} Panuelle has something he'd like to tell you.
:'''Chauvigne:''' Fine. I'll listen to what you have to say. But before that...
:'''Chauvigne:''' Look how shocked the two of you are! I'm sure you're dying to ask, "How can a flower speak?"
:'''Chauvigne:''' Or perhaps, "How did you turn into a potted flower?"
:{{DIcon}} Do people usually ask that?
:'''Chauvigne:''' Outside, yes, many. After I returned home... No, nobody has asked.
:'''Paimon:''' By "outside," do you mean outside this world?
:{{DIcon}} I've heard that you only became like this after venturing.
:'''Chauvigne:''' Well well, look who's so well-informed! I suppose Panuelle must have told you?
:'''Chauvigne:''' That's correct. I became like this while I was venturing. Hehe, to borrow a phrase from that Rozel... This was the "change" I chose to make.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets change... But why change into a potted flower?
:{{DIcon}} Could it be because you really, really like plants?
:{{DIcon}} Your dream is to become a botanist?
:'''Chauvigne:''' No. I just... wanted to find my "place."
:'''Chauvigne:''' I met many people outside this world. Some were chefs, others florists, others teachers.
:'''Chauvigne:''' Almost everyone had found a "place" that made them feel at ease. That was how they'd all managed to establish themselves in life.
:'''Chauvigne:''' And me? All I could do was venture. I had never thought of finding a stable "place" for myself.
:{{DIcon}} This "flower pot" is your "place."
:'''Chauvigne:''' Exactly. You catch on quick.
:'''Chauvigne:''' As a flower in a pot, I'll always have a "place" that puts me at ease.
:'''Chauvigne:''' But... *sigh* Since I've already got myself a pot, and a "place" that belongs to me, why do I still want to go out venturing?
:'''Chauvigne:''' I'm a venturer, after all. Without venturing, is there anything else of value I can do?
:'''Chauvigne:''' I don't get it. The more of the outside world I see, the less I understand... Between having a "place" and "venturing," which is more important?
:'''Chauvigne:''' The more I think about it, the more my head hurts... And when I talk with Panuelle, I always duck his questions.
:'''Chauvigne:''' I'm afraid of misleading him. If he loved venturing, would he grow to hate it after seeing me like this?
:'''Chauvigne:''' He is my friend, and always will be. I must be honest with him, and I have answered all that he has asked.
:'''Chauvigne:''' Including... That the reason I became a flower is so I could have a "place" that made me feel at ease.
:'''Chauvigne:''' Perhaps my answer upset him... Or perhaps, it's because he doesn't like the way I am now.
:'''Chauvigne:''' We are growing apart, but as I am but a potted plant, I cannot go up myself.
:'''Chauvigne:''' But it's probably for the best, I'm sure Panuelle doesn't want to see me anyway. He must be angry with me.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... So that's what's going on! You both think the other one's angry with you!
:{{DIcon}} And so they aren't willing to meet.
:'''Chauvigne:''' What? Y&mdash;You mean, Panuelle isn't mad at me?
:{{DIcon}} You two are thinking the exact same thing.
:{{DIcon}} He actually thinks you're the one who's angry at him.
:{{Black Screen|You tell Chauvigne all about everything Panuelle is thinking...}}
:'''Chauvigne:''' Skies above, how could I ever think such a thing? I have never wanted to see him upset, and even should the corners of his lips twitch downward, my heart should be utterly shattered!
:'''Chauvigne:''' Dear guests! I must ask you to bring me up, I beg it of you! I must see him with all haste! I cannot wait another minute, no, not even another second!
:{{DIcon}} I was waiting for you to say that, my potted friend.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon was waiting for it too! Off we go, {{Traveler}}!
----
;(Place Chauvigne at the entrance of the cave)
:'''Chauvigne:''' ...As I see it, this is not the place I should be right now.

;(Place Chauvigne in front of Panuelle)
:'''Panuelle:''' Chauvigne! Y&mdash;You've come. Please, listen to me, I've never been mad at you, and never wanted to leave you.
:'''Panuelle:''' I was only worried that you didn't want to be friends with me... I know that some venturers change, and I was worried you had too...
:'''Panuelle:''' I prayed to the goddess, but... But I couldn't find a good enough gift to offer, so she naturally ignored me...
:'''Chauvigne:''' No! Panuelle, such a thing could never happen. I will always, always be your friend.
:'''Chauvigne:''' I must apologize to you! I was so focused on my own thoughts that I failed to listen to what you were saying.
:'''Chauvigne:''' I assumed... I assumed you never wanted to see me again.
:{{DIcon}} Seems we've cleared up this misunderstanding.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Paimon thought you two had some crazy sticking point, and were so super mad you didn't even want to try and understand each other!
:{{DIcon}} It definitely was a sticky matter...
:{{DIcon}} But at least it's come unstuck now.
:'''Chauvigne:''' Thank you both, my dear guests. Without you, I'd definitely still be holed up in there, refusing to come out.
:'''Chauvigne:''' But now, I can finally share what's in my heart with Panuelle.
:'''Panuelle:''' I am always willing to listen to whatever you have to say, Chauvigne. Whether you wish to speak of venturing, or of flower pots... It's all fine by me.
:'''Panuelle:''' Right, dear guests. Please, take these. I gathered them specially for you.
:'''Panuelle:''' May the goddess bless you, that you may never argue with your friends, and that someone will always be willing to listen to your innermost thoughts.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Chauvigne:''' These are my true thoughts...
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Panuelle:''' I'm listening. I've been listening...
