'''To Be Cleaned''' is [[Noelle]]'s [[Level 4 Constellation]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{TalentNote|icd|The extra Geo DMG}}
** This ICD is shared with [[Breastplate]]'s Activation DMG.
* The damage dealt by this ability is based on Noelle's ATK at the end of Breastplate's duration (as opposed to her ATK when Breastplate is initially used).
* The ability does trigger when Noelle uses Breastplate while the shield from a previous use of Breastplate is still active.
