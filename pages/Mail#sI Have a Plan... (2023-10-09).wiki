|text      = Recently, I saw a [[Fatui]] Agent harassing a shop owner and intervened. I didn't expect he'd come back today asking for a duel, especially after his recent defeat.

He is a crook and I fully expect a nefarious ambush behind his challenge. But if I turn him down, he would only get even more brazen.

After much thought, I came up with a plan: publicly agree to the duel and ask someone to hide in the shadows, ready to collect evidence. Once the time is right, my ally will jump out to join forces with me and capture this ruffian along with his accomplices in one fell swoop.

As for that ally... you are my first choice, for you possess excellent physical prowess and a strong sense of justice.

Your remuneration and victuals have been prepared, and I await your response to my invitation.
