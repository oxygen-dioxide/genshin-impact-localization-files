==Trivia==
* The adventurer described in this artifact set's lore may be [[Herman]] from [[Mondstadt]]. Herman was once an adventurer affiliated with the Adventurers' Guild (mentioned in the Adventurer's Pocket Watch) who stopped adventuring to be with the girl he liked (mentioned in the Adventurer's Tail Feather). It is known that he pawned off his [[Cool Steel]] sword after he gave up the adventurer's lifestyle, making it likely he also pawned off the goblet.
