| "The initial setting of the story that the author of this manuscript is writing is Mondstadt. This draft is meant to be the cover of the novel's first volume."<br />"Mondstadt... the city of poetry, wine, and dandelions..."<br />"I remember that Mondstadt has this huge Favonius Cathedral."<br />"Ah, wouldn't that make a great starting point for a great adventure?"<br />"Huh? The main character's abilities? Since this is Mondstadt... it's got to be Anemo powers!"<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"The Favonius Cathedral is indeed very imposing. *sigh* If only I could have seen it with my own eyes..."

I've heard that there's a gigantic tree in Windrise that would make for a good photo-op. I bet that an illustration based on that location will do great!"<br />"Eh? That big tree has special significance to the Knights? Really? Okay, tell me everything!"<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"Thank for helping me gather these materials, Traveler."<br />"{{sic|Still, I'm still}} quite curious, what exactly is the legend of that tree?"<br />"Could you tell me the tale when you have the time?"

| "An inn that is full of guests despite being out in the boonies... It sure has an amazing aura of mystery!"<br />"Hmm, I wonder if the Boss or Lady Boss conceals unbelievable skills."<br />"And it would be nice if we also had a seemingly ordinary and lax but very powerful man and a handsome lad who always has a cold expression on his face..."<br />"Ah, yes! And they need a cook, too!"<br />"I'm sure this is going to be a fun drawing session. This is such a lively scene!"<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"Thank you, Traveler. The composition of your picture is quite excellent."<br />"Mm, the person who made this inn really does have excellent taste..."

* Character must face Dragonspine
| "This author hopes that I can draw a full panorama of Dragonspine."<br />"However, Dragonspine is so big... I'm not sure if there's any angle from which you can get all of it."<br />"Hmm, wait... If we drew this scene, it would really feel more like a picture you would put at a story's conclusion."<br />"Speaking of which, Ms. Moriko is pretty fond of Dragonspine..."<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"Wow, I'm feeling the chill just looking at this."<br />"Once we finish this one, I should go to the hot springs with Ms. Moriko..."

| "Did you know that there is a region in Mondstadt that once belonged to the Great Wolf King of the North?"<br />"I've heard it mentioned in this book that he was once a regional god, and that he was related to both ice and wind."<br />"I was thinking that adding some lightning to the scene might make the battle even more awesome!"<br />"Why lightning, you ask?" Well, lightning's just cool!"<br />"Not to be challenged lightly, you say? Well... Alright, let's just have the lightning, shall we? And make it very cool! This is going into a cover page, you know!"<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"Wow, that is very awesome lightning."<br />"Hmm, but how exactly to draw this, I wonder..."
|-

| "This adventure novel is related to Qingce Village's..."<br />"...Uh, how do I read this? 'Chi'? Yeah, it's got to do with this 'Chi' thing."<br />"That said, I'm pretty sure Qingce Village is a really sleepy place, isn't it?"<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"Hahaha... No matter how you look at it, Qingce Village really is a peaceful, ordinary place."<br />"That author really has a grandiose imagination..."
|-
| [[File:Outside the Canvas, Inside the Lens 07.png|200px]]<br />'''Aporia of the Valley'''<br />[[Lisha]], Liyue
|
* [[Tianqiu Valley]], Liyue
* The angle must span 3 photo-taking points
* Character's weapon must be a Catalyst.
* Character must face the Kamera
* Use a Charged Attack when the picture is taken
| "This manuscript... requires the main character to 'unleash a fearsome attack'!?"<br />"Well, this is rather vague, isn't it?"<br />"Why does Ms. Moriko always send me these seemingly ordinary but difficult-to-draw manuscripts!?"<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"To tell you the truth, I didn't understand what this light novel's title was at all."<br />"...But I suppose it won't affect my illustrations too much. Right?"
|-

|
* Near Liyue Harbor
* The angle must span 2 photo-taking points
* Character's weapon must be a Catalyst.
* Character must face the Kamera
* Use a Normal Attack when the picture is taken
| "Speaking of which, I've been stumped by a certain manuscript for a while now."<br />"The main character here is about to enter their final battle, so the light novelist asked if I could draw a spread-page illustration with a 'formidable' look."<br />"What I'm thinking is that we should use an image in which the main character is facing the frame and initiating an attack. That should have the expressiveness we need!"<br />"That said, I haven't thought of an angle yet, and I don't want to find someone to attack me..."<br />"So please, help me out here!"<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"I've heard that the author of this light novel is a very experienced writer, and a very good one too."<br />"I won't let them down, just you watch!"
|-

|
* Near [[Jueyun Karst]]
* The angle must span 2 photo-taking points
* Character must face the Kamera, must be from Liyue.
* Use a Normal Attack when the picture is taken
| "This is also a request from that novelist from Liyue. The novel he wrote is still ongoing..."<br />"This time, he would like a cover image of the main character wielding their sword at night."<br />"I mean, I've done images like this pretty often, but I'd like to try something new this time..."<br />"Traveler, do you know if people from Liyue have unique ways of using the blade?"<br /><br />'''Completed'''<br />"This author really is brilliant. That story felt finished, but he was able to continue it just the same..."<br />"And it seems that it's been very well-received, too. Truly, a brilliant writer."

* Evening (16:00 – 18:00)
* Character must face the Kamera.
* Take a picture of the character idling
| "A warrior standing silhouetted against the sunset..."<br />"This commission seems normal enough. A cover page, perhaps? Something that can be signed on and used in promotional material..."<br />"Still, we need to spice this one up a bit..."<br />"Also, how is this novel series still ongoing? I can't help but feel that it should have ended in the first volume..."<br /><br />'''Completed'''<br />"Somehow, that author keeps writing, and it's still so popular."<br />"I suppose I shouldn't have doubted the prowess of a true veteran of the scene."<br />"This person really is brilliant, whether it comes to writing or dealing with editors..."<br />"*cough* Alright, that's enough of that. I'll get back to drawing now."
|-

Um, if I remember this right, it was about an adventure team exploring an underground space..."<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"Uhh, this valley... just looking at it makes me weak in the knees..."<br />"Thank you, Traveler, I'll get this one done as soon as possible..."

* Tiangong Gorge
* The angle must span 2 photo-taking points

Thank you, Traveler. This'll do."
|-

He said that this is intended for a "film advertisement poster."<!--sic missing closing quote--><br />"Mr. Xavier had a samurai with him, and he had originally intended for that samurai, Toranosuke, to model for this image. However, the latter refused quite firmly."<br />"In the end, Ms. Moriko told me to exercise my own creativity. As for the samurai's weapon... I guess it'll have to either be a sword or a spear."<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"Thank you, I'll work on creating a film advertisement poster that will satisfy Mr. Xavier."<br />"This is the first time I've had to attempt such an artwork, so I must admit that I'm actually a little nervous, hehe..."

Yougou here in Inazuma? I reckon that it would make a cool backdrop."<br />"Mm, yes, I think that wielding one's elemental powers underneath Mt. Yougou would make for a most awesome scene indeed!"<br /><br />'''Completed:'''<br />"Thank you! I should be able to draw a wonderful backdrop this way."<br />"That said... I feel like light novels that focus on combat are becoming more and more common. I wonder why that is..."
