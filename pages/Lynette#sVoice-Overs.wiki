|vo_06_02_tx         = I used to think that the golden sun and dark shadows of the night could never understand one another. But in you, I see a kind of strange complexity that has needlessly piqued my curiosity... I'll have to keep a close eye on you.

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = I prefer to use my eyes to understand the situation and find an appropriate solution, as opposed to using martial prowess. But having brute force as an option greatly increases the potential cards at your disposal, and enables you to protect those most important to you in a crisis.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = Making tea looks simple on the surface, but it is actually quite complex. The quality of the tea leaves, the temperature of the water, the number of times to add water... Only when every variable is properly controlled can tea of the purest taste be brewed. Would you like a cup?

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = Animals can also express their feelings. If you listen carefully, you can tell what state they are in. For a kitty, "Meow~" means they are much happier than "Meow meow meow!", and in that situation, you can pet them as much as you want and they won't run away.

|vo_08_01_tx         = I have always been together with Lyney, and we can tell what the other is thinking without speaking. Thus, he tends to be more quiet than normal when we are alone. Hmm? Can I tell when he's lying or telling the truth? Of course I can, but this matter is top secret.

|vo_08_02_tx         = Lyney is normally quite confident, and does everything with incredible ease... or at least, that's how he wants everyone else to see him. So when he runs into difficulties, he always wants to solve everything perfectly on his own... if this happens, please be sure to take good care of him.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Lyney

|vo_08_03_tx         = He is a delicate and gentle child, but also tends to belittle himself... perhaps due to his previous experiences. Sometimes he feels like the antithesis of Lyney... but since they're both family, when their opinions clash, I will bridge their differences.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Freminet, Lyney

|vo_08_05_tx         = The Chief Justice always feels strangely aloof, though his words are always humble... or perhaps he just doesn't like dealing with humans? After all, when he speaks with [[Melusine]]s, he's actually quite friendly.

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Furina]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Furina.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = Lady Furina's behavior is incredibly hard to explain, and I can't discern any useful intelligence from observing her. I always feel like her every move and action is an act, and she is playing different people... She truly is an Archon, one cannot apply the logic of ordinary humans to her.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Furina

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Navia]]

|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Navia.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = Though she's the new president of [[Spina di Rosula]], her style is more like the nosy big sister next door. If we really had a sister like her in the "[[House of the Hearth]]," that would be really great... I know I probably shouldn't be wishing for anyone to be an orphan, but...
|vo_08_07_mention    = Navia

|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Clorinde.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = I was once ordered to observe a duel of hers. Even just as a bystander, the coldness radiating from her was absolutely chilling... I don't know what it would be like to face her directly in a duel, and I hope I will never find out.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Clorinde

|vo_08_09_title      = About [[Chiori]]
|vo_08_09_friendship = 4

|vo_08_09_tx         = The costumes Lyney and I wear for performances were specially tailored by Chiori. Once, Lyney was using a small knife for a magic trick, and accidentally cut the cuff of his sleeve a bit. She scolded us nonstop... it was scary. Luckily, I can hide behind Lyney whenever we go to her shop.

|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Charlotte.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = Uh... I was eventually cornered by her for interviews a few times. The way she persistently asked even after Lyney rejected her all those times, I really have to commend her perseverance. Too bad for her, though... despite preparing all those questions, I never answered a single one.
|vo_08_10_mention    = Charlotte, Lyney

|vo_08_11_title      = About [[Emilie]]
|vo_08_11_friendship = 4
|vo_08_11_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Emilie.ogg
|vo_08_11_tx         = Her perfume products are so popular that you have to get in line before the break of dawn to have a chance at snapping any up. However, I'm far too sensitive to the smell of perfume, and it's really rude to sneeze... so I have to take the long way around.

|vo_09_03_tx         = Magic shows were once our livelihood, but now they are more of a convenient identity to present to society. In the name of magic performances, we can easily gain more access throughout the city, and be the "eyes" of our House.

|vo_09_04_tx         = Before Lyney and I came to our new home, we were constantly adrift on the streets. We experienced many hardships and dangerous situations... It was then that I developed the habit of paying attention to any sign of danger, and also gradually learned to understand what others were thinking. Fortunately, we now have a safe place to live.

|vo_09_05_tx         = Building a relationship with someone is like gambling. No matter how much information you have, it's hard to predict how other people might change. I've always had the habit of keeping a safe distance from others, but in your case... I'm willing to shoulder the risk of losing a bet.

|vo_10_01_tx         = A person's mental state is like a bowstring. If it's constantly under high tension, it will be at risk of suddenly snapping. So outside of work, I prefer to do things that relax my brain, like making tea, feeding cats, and just zoning out. The calmer one normally is, the easier it is to deal with crises when they do pop up.
