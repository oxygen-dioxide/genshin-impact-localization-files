==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yongzan:''' Oh, will you look at the time? Dear me, we should be sipping tea and having dim sum right now!
:{{DIcon}} You are?
::'''Yongzan:''' Me? I'm just an ordinary guard for hire.
::'''Yongzan:''' If you're here for business, you can go talk to Han at the [[Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency (Point of Interest)|Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency]].
::'''Yongzan:''' It's almost time for tea. What should I eat?
::'''Yongzan:''' What do you think? Wait, you don't seem to be from around here. Never mind...
:{{DIcon}} How can you be so relaxed?
::'''Yongzan:''' I just finished a job that took half a year, so I'm taking it easy right now.
::'''Yongzan:''' It's different these days. The [[Communications Office]] doesn't want to see a monopoly, and they want all Secure Transport Agencies to have jobs.
::'''Yongzan:''' I used to get ten or so big jobs in six months, but nowadays I only get about two. The other eight've gone to other agencies.
::'''Yongzan:''' But that's fine with me. I can still enjoy life without those eight jobs, but some might starve if they don't get their share.
::'''Yongzan:''' When I was still a rookie, no one looked after me. I'll just think of this as a favor for the Communications Office and for the young ones.
::'''Yongzan:''' If I keep taking their jobs, I might feel bad when I get old, you know?
:{{DIcon}} Then I'll go "yum cha" too.
::'''Yongzan:''' That sounds about right. Now get going.
