'''Sugar Rush''' is [[Varesa]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Varesa possesses distinct bovine traits, with black-tipped horns curving from her head and matching ears. A small golden bell hangs from her left ear, reminiscent of a cowbell. Around her neck, she wears a white fur collar, fastened to a structured piece similar to a dickey, with a pink and teal bow below it and a golden cattle symbol as its center.

Her attire consists of a pastel yellow cropped sweater with a prominent chest cutout, exposing a black inner crop top adorned with triangular patterns. The outer layer is held together at the back by her {{Electro}} [[Vision]]. She wears detached puff sleeves in the same pastel yellow, secured at the wrists by teal and pink ribbons.

She pairs this with a black miniskirt, fitted with a pink belt resembling a championship belt. The belt’s main plate is embossed with the golden emblem of the [[Collective of Plenty]], and multicolored tassels hang below it. The skirt is tailored to accommodate her bovine tail.

Her legwear is asymmetrical, with white leg warmers extending just below the knees, cinched by black strings that end in tassels and white pom-poms. Her right leg is covered by a white thigh-high sock reaching her upper thigh, complemented by a pink kneepad. On her left leg, a teal sock extends just beyond the top of her leg warmer. Both leg warmers are adorned with multicolored embellishments attached.

For footwear, she wears black-and-white chunky shoes with a cushioned structure, resembling foam footwear.
