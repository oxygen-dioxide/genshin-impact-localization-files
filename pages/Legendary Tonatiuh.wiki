{{Location Intro|description=<p>The '''Tonatiuh''', also called the '''Skyserpent Ship''',<ref name="VWMM">{{Ref/Quest|Vaulting the Wall of Morning Mist}}</ref> is a sky-faring ship built by the [[dragons]], and later modified by [[Och-Kan]]. Originally envisioned as a satellite to anchor the "stairway" or "cable" leading from [[Chichen Uctokah]] into the space beyond [[Teyvat]], it was turned on its side after Och-Kan seized the city.<ref name=Omen>{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref> It is rumored to be filled with treasure, leading countless adventurers to search for it over the years. However, this was revealed to be a fake legend perpetuated by [[Kukulkan]] to lure in brave souls for his personal "experiment."<ref name="MOA">{{Ref/Quest|Moment of Awakening}}</ref></p>}}

It is unlocked during the {{Quest|To the Sky-Road}}.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(First interaction)
:'''Goggles Left Behind by Someone:''' (These appear to be a pair of goggles that were left here a long time ago. They once belonged to [[Bona|an adventurer]] who challenged [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan|a mighty, unknown foe]].)
:'''Goggles Left Behind by Someone:''' (The trap that once waylaid the people, planted by the Sage whom she laid down her life to defy, has now been destroyed. These goggles are the sole remaining testament to her existence.)
:'''Goggles Left Behind by Someone:''' (Beneath the goggles, a stack of woven scrolls lie half-buried in the sand. The handwriting upon them is identical to that on the notes you discovered within [[Ochkanatlan]].)
::'''A Nameless Adventurer's Notes'''
::Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown. Weather: Can't tell from where I am now...
::&nbsp;
::...It's completely different from what I imagined. I didn't expect the Tonatiuh to be such a desolate place. I can almost see what the [[Och-Kan|Python King]] must've felt in those final moments...
::&nbsp;
::...Still, there's [[Pyrophosphorite]] everywhere. Does that mean this is the origin of all the Pyrophosphorite that adventurers get? But who could take it from here and give it to them...
::&nbsp;
::...So that's it. It's only thanks to [[Cocouik|Coco]] that I now understand the true nature of the "Jade of Return"...
::&nbsp;
::...The machine that could save [[Natlan]], but not us... So many heroes have been sacrificed for this... So why draw us here...? I get it, you can't touch it, can you? That's why you need our hands, need Coco's...
::&nbsp;
::...But even if it's a fake Sacred Grail, it doesn't matter if it's ██, or Aunt [[Liriwu]], anyone who embarks on the journey is a true hero!...
::&nbsp;
::...This is the last fragment of Pyrophosphorite left in the land... Was it your plan for me to bring it here? I guess that's fine, though, since this way, nobody else'll be tricked by you...
::&nbsp;
::...I won't let you get it! Because we're going to stop your plan, right here!
