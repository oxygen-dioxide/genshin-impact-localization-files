[[Lyney]]'s and my birthday is here.

The year before last, his "surprise" was a present hidden inside the cake, and last year, it was for Rosseland to pop out of the hat with colored flags...

My presents are much more ordinary. No matter how much effort I put in, he'll always guess it... Just like I can guess his plans.

But he seems to really enjoy it all the same. Whatever floats his boat.

I was planning to just go ahead and invite you myself this year, but I feel like Lyney is most likely planning to pester you to help him with a whole pile of schemes...

If that really does happen, can you humor him a bit? I'll do my best to pretend not to know anything.
