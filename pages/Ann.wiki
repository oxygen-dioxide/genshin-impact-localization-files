==Profile==
Ann is an [[Oceanid]] created by the consciousness of [["Mary-Ann"]] in the hopes of seeing how the world has "changed" over the past few years.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Mary-Ann's Story}}</ref> It is later revealed that Ann was born when the Oceanid [[Lyris]] accidentally absorbed the personality of [[Mary-Ann]], during a battle between the [[Marechaussee Phantom|Marechaussee Hunters]] and the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]] within [[Elynas]]. The merged consciousness of Lyris and Mary-Ann became the Oceanid "Mary-Ann," who constructed the dream world of [[Annapausis]] and accidentally created Ann through these dreams (a form of Oceanid reproduction, as theorized by Caterpillar).<ref>World Quest Act, In the Wake of Narcissus: Act I: ''[[Search in the Algae Sea]]''</ref> As a result, Ann possesses the memories of both the real Mary-Ann and Lyris.

===Appearance===
Being a smaller version of an [[Oceanid]], she shares a similar appearance to [[Endora]]. Her human form resembles a young [[Mary-Ann Guillotin]].

;(Upon completing [[Initial Facts]])
:'''Ann:''' Knight {{Traveler}}...
:{{DIcon}} About the current situation...
::'''Ann:''' I believe I've recalled certain... some very vague feelings. I am not sure they can even be called memories...
::'''Ann:''' Though I don't know whether humans keep their memories in their heads or in their heart...
::'''Ann:''' But [[Lochfolk|Oceanids]] seem to have neither a brain nor a heart, just water...
::'''Ann:''' If only I could be like that [[Seymour|silly dog]], just sit there and mumble stuff like "Drive Defragmenting" to recall everything...
:{{DIcon}} I want to know more about you, Ann...
::'''Ann:''' I don't know what else I can tell you...
::'''Ann:''' I'm the part of [[Mary-Ann]] that was imagined into being here, but... but she rejected me, and the others as well... I mean, other existences...
::'''Ann:''' The [[Lyris|Princess Lyris]] I want to rescue does not exist. "Mary-Ann" is also not Mary-Ann, and isn't that silly dog's owner.
::'''Ann:''' I don't know why, but when I see that silly dog, something just swells inside of me... It feels like bubbles! But they burst whenever I get close to remembering...
::'''Ann:''' [[Caterpillar]] seems to know something, but he won't say much if he's not 100% sure.
::'''Ann:''' We came to the [[The Narzissenkreuz Ordo|place with Narzissenkreuz in its name]], yet nothing was resolved...
:{{DIcon}} I want to know more about [[Lyris|Princess Lyris]]...
::'''Ann:''' Princess Lyris is kind and courageous. That's why she endangered herself... in order to protect her friends.
::'''Ann:''' Before, all I thought was that I must have been a friend of hers and she protected me, so now that's she's in trouble, I have to save her.
::'''Ann:''' Even though she might not want me to do that... because she is too nice, and would suffer than let her friends be in danger.
::'''Ann:''' But if I don't save her, how could I be worthy of being her friend or deserve her protection?
::'''Ann:''' "Memories"... They're hazy, like whirlpools in water. Emotions and desires, on the other hand, feel so real, despite me realizing she's just a character in a story now...
:{{DIcon}} It's all right. Just go to bed.
:'''Ann:''' Okay. Goodnight, Knight {{Traveler}}.
