*Khaenri'ahns who are of pure-blood descent are deemed as "the greater sinners" and punished with the curse of immortality, while all other citizens (those who are half-blood or hail from other nations entirely) are punished with the "curse of the wilderness," transforming them into monsters such as [[hilichurl]]s, [[Abyss Mages]], [[Abyss Lector]]s, [[Abyss Herald]]s or [[The Black Serpents]].
** Of these, [[Pierro]], a royal mage, [[Thrain]], a commander, and [[Chlothar]], a noble, are afflicted with the curse of immortality, while [[Caribert]], the illegitimate son of Chlothar and a unnamed [[Mondstadt]]-born mother, was afflicted with the curse of the wilderness, transforming into an hilichurl.
* The [[Traveler's Sibling]] witnesses Khaenri'ah's destruction.

*'''? years ago''' ― Near the end of their journey, the [[Traveler's Sibling|Traveler's sibling]] realizes the "truth of this world" and parts ways with Dainsleif. Eventually, the Traveler's sibling aligns themselves with the Abyss Order and declares Dainsleif to be their enemy.
*'''? years ago''' ― After Chlothar is driven fully insane by the effects of the curse of immortality, he disappears and is presumed to have died within the realm of the [[Avidya Forest]] after finally finding a way to break the curse. The Abyss Order continues operation, now under the control of the Traveler's sibling.
*'''? years ago''' ― [[Klingsor]], a refugee from Khaenri'ah, joins the [[Order of Skeptics]]. However, he becomes suspicious of their teachings and eventually embraces the Abyss, though his plans unleash the Abyss are foiled by the remaining members and the Pari.
