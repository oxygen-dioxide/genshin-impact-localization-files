'''Potions''' are [[consumable]] [[Food]] items that can be [[craft]]ed with [[Alchemy]] at a [[Crafting Bench]]. They can buff the entire party's elemental damage or increase their elemental resistance for 300 seconds. The effects of these potions do not stack; using a second potion will overwrite the effects of the first one. After being crafted, potions can be found in the Food category of the [[Inventory]].
