|text      = A long time ago, [[Frederica Gunnhildr|Mother]] wrote to me that the [[Knights of Favonius]]' expedition had made significant progress. Based on new clues they had gathered, the [[Varka|Grand Master]] decided to head to [[Nod-Krai]] for further investigation, while Mother and several other knights were ordered to return to [[Dornman Port]] for defense.

Dornman Port isn't too far from [[Mondstadt]], but with both Mother and I busy with our duties, we haven't had a chance to meet.

I thought this routine would continue, but yesterday evening, Mother and [[Barbara]] suddenly appeared at the Knights of Favonius headquarters.

Mother's figure in the wind was as strong and graceful as ever. Seeing her smile again after so long, I almost forgot to return her knightly salute.

I'll be spending this rare day with my family. I've baked some snacks, so if you have time, please come by for a visit.
