{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sage:''' Heya!
:{{DIcon}} Hey there, kiddo.
::'''Sage:''' Mm! Say, have you heard of the [[Dandelion Sea]]?
::{{DIcon}} The Dandelion Sea, you say?
::'''Sage:''' Uh-huh! There's [[The Fox in the Dandelion Sea|this book]] I read, it says that somewhere in Mondstadt, there is a biiiiig sea of dandelions!
::'''Sage:''' It even has little talking foxes in it!
::{{DIcon}} Little talking foxes?
::'''Sage:''' Yup! I wanna know what talking to animals is like!
::'''Sage:''' Hmm... But I've only seen a [[Venti|guy in green clothes and white socks]] talk to animals before. Happened to bump into him.
::'''Sage:''' I told Mom how awesome he was, but that guy said that I was mistaken.
:{{DIcon}} See you, kiddo.
::'''Sage:''' Seeya!
::'''Sage:''' Tell me if you ever see the Dandelion Sea!

==Trivia==
* [[Parsley]], [[Rosemary]], and Sage are all named after herbs. This may be a reference to the lyrics of some versions of the traditional English ballad, {{w|Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair}}, in which the line "Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme" form part of the refrain.
