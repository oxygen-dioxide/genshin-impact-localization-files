==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|The time you and Tlazolli agreed upon has almost arrived. You prepare to pay her a visit to check on the Blazegem Inscription's progress.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Children of Echoes)
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 99 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, it's been several days now... wonder if [[Tlazolli]] has finished making the [[Blazegem Inscription]]!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 99 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Since Nechca's birthday is just around the corner, let's go to the tribe to buy some things, and then pay the family a visit!

;(Approach Xilonen)
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 01.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Xilonen! Good thing you're here, I'm wondering if I can&mdash;
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The shelf on the left, second row down, first axe on the right... that one's yours. The garden hoe belongs to [[Iknal]] and the hammer is [[Pacal]]'s, so make sure you take the one that's yours.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 02.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' I haven't even said why I'm here... But looks like you're about to head out for a break?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Yes, but I'm going to take it right here. The temperature's just perfect today.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 03.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Really? But doesn't it feel a lot hotter than usual? I really don't want to stay out in this heat.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Exactly. In hot weather like this, customers don't tend to stick around and talk when they're coming to place orders or pick up the goods.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 04.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' I see... Oh, here comes another customer. I'll just leave you to it then, and pick up my axe.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Sure, sounds good to me.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Xilonen!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, we meet again. You two seem to be in good spirits.
;(If the player has not completed step 12 of ''[[As the Sun Rises and Sets]]'')
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' How's your [[Pilgrim's Chronicle]] been? Run into any issues?
::{{DIcon}} No, everything is fine.
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Good. It was also my first time receiving a Pilgrim's Chronicle. Even though I've already turned it over to you...
;(If the player has completed step 12 of ''As the Sun Rises and Sets'')
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 48.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' How's your [[Obsidian Ancient Name|Ancient Name]] been? Run into any issues?
::{{DIcon}} No, everything is fine.
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 49.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Good. It was my first time working with the Lord of the Night to forge an Ancient Name, and you're not even from Natlan.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' There are still a lot of things that could go wrong, so I wasn't sure if there would be any issues.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So, uh... what are the chances that something might still go wrong?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Less than the chances of [[Mualani]] accidentally falling off a [[Spiritway]], I'd say.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, well that definitely would never happen...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 05.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' I've found the axe, Xilonen. Thanks a lot.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 06.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' By the way, [[Nechca]]'s birthday is coming up real soon. Are you planning to visit her?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I've prepared a gift, and was just getting ready to take it to her.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 07.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' *sigh* You're not planning on giving the kid a full set of pliers again, are you? Or lemme guess, woodworking tools?
:{{DIcon}} You'd give these kinds of things as... birthday gifts?
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 11a 1.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That's right. Flowers will wither, toys will break, and snacks are quickly forgotten once they're eaten...
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 11a 2.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But a set of durable work tools will always stay with you, and get you through many sticky situations.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like a set, too! Where can I buy one?
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 11b 1.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I make these myself, and it's a lot of work. But if you'd like a set, I can make some time and forge one for you.
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 04b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! We often camp out in the wild, but a set of Xilonen's tools would make pitching a tent and starting a bonfire a whole lot easier.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Still, I won't be giving Nechca any tools this year. She wrote me a letter saying that she'd like a copy of "Tequil the Brave."
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The book is not what you'd call a bestseller, but luckily, I have a few copies in my collection. They were really old editions that were published a long time ago, but they should still be readable...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 08.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Haha, children her age love fairy tales. The last time I was at Tlazolli's, I even brought Nechca a&mdash;
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 09.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Huh? Wait... what did I bring her again? It must have been her favorite thing, but... Uh... Why can't I remember it anymore?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It is quite hot today, seems you're about to pass out from the heat. Do you even remember your own name?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 10.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' My memory can't be this bad. It's just these last few days... *sigh* I've been forgetting things for some odd reason.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' In that case, why don't you use the Blazegem Inscription you have as a memo to engrave some important things to remember?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 16.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' After all, that Inscription will never wear out, and it's easy to carry... I'd say that's quite a fitting use for it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 11.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Ahem... You do have a point, but... my Inscription is almost already full.
:{{DIcon}} Your name is that long?
:{{DIcon}} Did you include all your relatives' names too?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 12.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' No, no. I engraved some wishes on my Blazegem Inscription.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 13.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' You know, just some dreams that I have for the future and things I'd like to accomplish one day.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 14.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Even though Tlazolli has said that from an aesthetic point of view, it would be best for people to keep their Inscriptions short...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 15.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' This Blazegem Inscription was still made by a Name Engraver, the forger of Ancient Names themselves.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 16.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Everyone thinks that the Inscriptions she made might have some... wondrous powers.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 17.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' So, many people who bought Blazegem Inscriptions engraved their wishes and dreams on them in hopes that they would come true.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds kinda like a Wish Granter...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if you do that, won't everyone be able to see your wishes and dreams?
:{{DIcon}} I was just wondering the same thing...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, that could be a little embarrassing...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 18.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Hahaha, don't worry. We usually ask Tlazolli to add the inscriptions for us. She has a unique method of engraving.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 19.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' With her method, the light must be at a certain angle in order to see the text.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 20.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Without the right angle of lighting, the Blazegem Inscription will just look like a pretty stone.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 17.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That's true. In the end, a Blazegem Inscription is essentially just a piece of rock. It doesn't have the power to grant people's wishes.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 18.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Making wishes to it is like shouting into an echoing valley &mdash; the only one who'll answer is yourself.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 19.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But... using it as a journal for your wishes is also fine. Carrying them with you and taking a look from time to time can be a good source of encouragement...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 20.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' As long as you don't suddenly change your mind and want to take your wishes back, that is. These things are extremely durable &mdash; it would take a lot of effort to change the words.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 21.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And I don't think anyone would willingly part with it, either. They're not cheap, and very hard to get. If you ever lost it, you'd just be filled with regret.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 22.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Still, it's really strange... given Auntie's skill, how could it take so long for her to make one? I hope someone didn't give her the idea of making fewer and selling for more.
:{{DIcon}} Ugh, I know just the person who would do that...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds just like one of Cheven's schemes...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 21.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Hahaha! It's true, Cheven could totally have put that in her ear. Still, I don't think it's a bad thing for Tlazolli to make some money by selling these.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 22.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' At least she and little Nechca are better off now, and won't have to worry about the cost of treating her illness anymore.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 23.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' I was really worried about their family at first, and was even planning to send them some... uh, send some...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 24.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Huh? What was I planning to send to Nechca again? Ugh, this memory of mine...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 23.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Alright. If you stay out in the heat for any longer, I'm afraid even the Inscription won't be able to save your memory. You should go back and get some rest.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 25.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' Right... Right. Please give my regards to Tlazolli and Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 avilix 26.ogg}} '''Avilix:''' What's going on? Maybe I should go talk to [[Erinle]] to get some medicine...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you'll be going to Nechca's birthday party, too, Xilonen? Ooh, perfect, then let's go together!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 24.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Sure, but I didn't expect you to know Tlazolli, too. She hasn't even been coming to the tribe much lately, so how did you get a chance to talk with her?
:{{Black Screen|You explain your encounter with Tlazolli to Xilonen...}}
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 25.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So that's how you met her... She even wants to use Volcanic Crystal as a forging material... Guess she's really pulling out all the stops for her daughter.
:{{DIcon}} We also wanted to get a gift for Nechca.
:{{DIcon}} But we have no idea what she might like...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 26.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Then let's just go and ask. Come on, I want to give her the book anyway.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait a second, aren't birthday gifts supposed to be a surprise?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we ask Nechca, then she'll know what gift we'll be getting her, and that would ruin the surprise!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 27.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But if you don't ask her, then how will you know what kind of present she would like?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 28.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Here's another idea. Perhaps you can also give her a storybook based on what she wrote in her letter. That might be a good option.
:{{DIcon}} Easy enough, I have loads of those in my bag.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But shouldn't we give it a little more thought? If we all give her books, it might seem like we didn't put much effort into it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xilonen, have you really never asked her what she would like the most? There must be something else she'd like besides books.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 29.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Unfortunately, no. Nechca's illness has kept flaring up over the past few years. Apparently, she couldn't do anything during that time other than rest in her bed. She didn't even have the strength to talk to anyone.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 30.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It wasn't until recently that she started to recover from her illness and regained the strength to write letters to others.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 31.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Anyway, there's no need to overthink it. Worst case scenario, I can split the book into two volumes and we can each give her one.
:{{DIcon}} Great idea!
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 12a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, that's terrible! That would really look like we didn't try!
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 12a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's just go ask Nechca. Even though it would ruin the surprise, we could at least get her something that would make her happy.
:{{DIcon}} Let's just go and ask Nechca.
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 12b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, even though it would ruin the surprise, we could at least get her something that would make her happy.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, could you tell us a bit more about the book that you're getting her? Is it really that unpopular?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 32.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's a little difficult to explain. You see, there are actually two versions of "Tequil the Brave."
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 33.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The premise of the book is pretty straightforward. It's basically about a set of twin brothers working to defeat a demon lord.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 34.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But after defeating the demon lord, the older brother Tequil discovers that king's spirit has possessed his younger brother, Rimac.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 35.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' In the ending of the original story, the older brother kills his younger brother to defeat the demon lord, before himself jumping into a volcano.

-->[[File:Somewhat Aged Copy of Tequil the Brave Image.png|200px]]<br><!--
-->This tale comes from the desolate, distant past. In those days, the mountains' teeth were still bared like blades against man and beast, thirsting for the souls of the feeble-minded, human and nonhuman alike.<br><!--
-->People knew that the god of the mountains loved them not, and was to be given a wide berth. Yet they were forced to seek shelter in caverns from the storms screaming through the wilds, all to pass one long night after the next. But these caverns, like the mountains, extracted payment from these vagrants. Countless were the tribes who lost kin to the wastes through which they stumbled blind.<br><br><!--
-->Valiant Tequil and his kindhearted brother Rimac were born to one such tribe.<br><br><!--
-->At the hour of their birth, a long, troubling night reigned inside and outside the caves, and though the campfires around which the tribespeople sat flickered, none were comforted by their light.<br><!--
-->The people thought:<br><!--
-->"This fire shall soon go out, and once it does, we too shall be finished!"<br><!--
-->"How long will this night last? I'm cold... and hungry too..."<br><!--
-->"Let's hurry things up then! Quickly, let me walk into the night! Better that than this torment."<br><!--
-->"Oh, you poor children... You poor, poor children..."<br><br><!--
-->Yet Tequil and Rimac did not announce themselves with sorrowful cries as other children did.<br><!--
-->Instead, Tequil stared into the cavern depths. The minions of the cavern did their best to frighten him, but his gaze swept over them, keen as a sharp stone spur.<br><!--
-->"He has seen us, our sharp claws and long teeth, but he is not afraid!"<br><!--
-->The wicked creatures whispered amongst themselves anxiously, and involuntarily retracted said appendages.<br><br><!--
--><br><!--
-->Rimac for his part waved his hands and laughed, and his laughter was like pebbles tumbling in a stream, drawing the eyes of all the distressed tribespeople to his face. Only then did they notice that though the flame wavered, it had never ceased to burn, and with another wave of his hands, Rimac patted the firewood next to him.<br><br><!--
-->"Feed the flame! Feed the flame!"<br><!--
-->The elderly chief, thus reminded by the newborn boy, shouted his words aloud, repelling the fear that had been about to swallow the tribe whole.<br><br><!--
-->People stood and fueled the fire, and they drew their obsidian blades, casting their eyes into the cavern depths just as Tequil had.<br><br><!--
-->The beasts of the cavern were filled with rage and hate, but they knew that these people would not loosen their grip on their weapons, nor would their eyes be shut. Terror had already fled, and so death was forced to retreat.<br><br><!--
-->Only when the sun rose again did the brothers close their eyes, falling asleep in their mother's bosom.<br><br><!--
-->Thus did the tribespeople depart the cave, having lived another day. These people, who had rejected fear, would live countless days more.<br><br><!--
-->Yet the defeat of her evil underlings caught the eye of their master, Coatlicue.<br><!--
-->For this lord of demons, who claimed to be the mother of the underworld and mistress of ten thousand times ten thousand caves, whose fangs were the rocky stalactites, whose tongue was every blast of wet, frigid wind, and who upon awakening could only be satiated by devouring ten thousand living souls &mdash; Tequil and Rimac were the first humans to slip her grasp.<br><!--
-->Shamefaced, this earth mother waved her hand, lashing the evil beasts cowering to the side with rock.<br><!--
-->"Go! Go! Redeem your humiliating failure! Capture those dimwitted mortals and fill my stomach!"<br><br><!--
-->But having seen their fears vanquished, the people remembered well the methods of scattering those terrors time after time.<br><br><!--
-->They settled at the foot of the mountains, sharpened wooden stakes, lit fires, and gave the sharpest blades to their best warriors, with which they would stand guard behind the stakes. Their bright eyes pierced the wilderness beyond the firelight, and did not shift their gazes away for even a moment.<br><br><!--
-->By blade and fire did Coatlicue's minions taste defeat time after time, until they could do nothing but huddle in the dark, daring not to draw near the flame.<br><br><!--
-->The fires in the hearts of the people ignited, and they began to speak of victory, of light, and of the end of the viper &mdash; they believed in Tequil and Rimac. These two brothers could surely keep the heat and light alive.<br><br><!--
-->Tequil and Rimac thought the same, and so they sharpened their spears and blades, preparing to drive the demon lord of that evil serpent to her doom.<br><br><!--
-->But the earth mother, who hated this tribe, did not relent.<br><!--
-->She took sludge from the deepest parts of the cave and pinched it into a snake. Then, she plucked out her eye, setting it into the serpent's eye socket.<br><!--
-->"It was that child who caused you to witness the fire, and so, let me go and swallow his eyes."<br><br><!--
-->One evening, when the sun had just set, night's veil was slowly covering the sky, and the stars had yet to begin granting their light, the serpent bit and slew a rabbit beyond the tribe's bounds, and burrowed into its skin, lying flat on the ground.<br><br><!--
-->Rimac, returning from gathering herbs, came upon this rabbit, and seeing its wound, the kind child put his torch down without hesitation, and reaching for his herbs, he chewed on them, preparing to apply them to the rabbit. But the snake, speaking for the earth mother, leaped from the wound, hissing laughter:<br><br><!--
-->"Hahaha, ignorant, foolish human! Sacrificing yourself for a lowly rabbit!"<br><br><!--
-->Before Rimac could retrieve his torch, the earth mother's serpent latched its fangs first onto his neck, then, burrowing into his body, captured his heart and soul both.<br><br><!--
-->The defenseless sentries were the next to be murdered by the earth mother, for they greeted Rimac just as they always did when he returned from gathering herbs, only to be pierced through the heart by the serpent, dying on the spot. The entire tribe's fires were put out, and amidst the shroud of darkness, death and terror were resurgent.<br><br><!--
-->The earth mother spat the snake out, and through poisoned fangs she cried out:<br><!--
-->"Behold! Behold, you arrogant fools, and kneel as you should in the dust!"<br><br><!--
-->But the sound of a rock being struck cut her off, for Tequil, who had been sharpening his obsidian blade, used it to create sparks that set his tent alight.<br><br><!--
-->He raised his blade and charged forward, letting fly his blade at the earth mother's messenger. The blazing edge cleaved the poisoned serpent molded from soil with ease, but as Tequil was about to follow through, he saw his brother's eyes and the blood staining his brother's hands.<br><br><!--
-->That instant was all the time the wounded viper needed to escape. Yet nigh fully charred it was still, and the earth mother's eye reduced almost to ashes.<br><br><!--
-->This tribe was destroyed, and never again was there a chance it would dare defy her.<br><br><!--
-->Thus did the earth mother comfort herself as she retreated into the darkness.<br><!--
-->How Tequil wished to call out Rimac's name! But the burning dust caught in his throat, and so he could only watch as his brother vanished into the night.<br><br><!--
-->When the night at last passed, Tequil, who stood amidst the ruins, knew that the surviving tribespeople could no longer stay. Burying his confusion and pain deep in his heart, he led them on a new journey.<br><br><!--
-->They crossed mountains and canyons, dodging fearsome beasts and poisonous insects. Tequil did not close his eyes for so long as they journeyed, nor did he dare to loosen his grip on blade or torch.<br><br><!--
-->Finally, by a silent volcano, they found a tribe willing to take them in.<br><br><!--
-->Only after he saw the last of his tribe peacefully fall into slumber under the old shaman's care did he relax and collapse to the earth.<br><br><!--
-->When he awoke, he found himself in a blazing cave. The lava that surrounded him undulated with an erratic pulse, as if the very mountain was slowly breathing. When he stood up, the lava boiled and bubbled, and a rumbling came from all directions:<br><br><!--
-->"Do not search for your brother. His eyes have been devoured by a cunning serpent."<br><!--
-->"But I must save him, and pursue that venomous snake also!"<br><br><!--
-->His words echoed through the cave, but the Goddess of Mountains and Fire was silent.<br><!--
-->Tequil thus prayed unto her:<br><!--
-->"Let my brother's name live on. I am willing to sacrifice my heart and blood in return."<br><!--
-->The goddess answered him in the echoing cave.<br><!--
-->Thus said she:<br><!--
-->"Your prayer have I heard, but your brother is no longer your kin. His name has sunken into the deepest of depths."<br><!--
-->Tequil raised his head and lifted up his wish to the goddess:<br><!--
-->"Turn my blood to fire, so my heart may illuminate the depths. I will bring my brother back before my blood runs dry."<br><!--
-->"Turn my blood to fire, until my soul may sear and slay that serpent. I will take its head before my blood runs dry."<br><br><!--
-->When Tequil awoke once again, the old shaman of the tribe gave him a brand-new sword, food, and water.<br><!--
-->Finally, the shaman clasped his shoulders and blessed him:<br><!--
-->"May your fire dry the venomous snake's venom."<br><br><!--
-->Thus did Tequil embark on another journey. His strength was endless, his body tireless, and his blood burned like lava. He crossed grassy fields and snowy peaks, deep valleys and high mountains, and the Goddess of Mountains and Fire showed him the way with falling rocks and the cracks in cliffs. Thus did Tequil stride forward without hesitation.<br><br><!--
-->When he met his brother again, the earth mother mocked him once more using Rimac's body and voice, but when her claws pierced Tequil's chest, he moved not, and instead her bones were melted by his burning blood.<br><!--
-->Tequil stared the vicious demon lord down, and said in a loud voice:<br><!--
-->"My brother is gentle of heart. He would surely have made this land a better place."<br><!--
-->"Yet you have affronted him with your poison, smothered his virtue, slaughtered those who had faith in his virtue!"<br><!--
-->"Die, you despicable, venomous insect! Die here!"<br><!--
-->As he roared, Tequil's blood stained his obsidian blade, turning it red-hot in an instant. The earth mother watched in terror as her shell, bones, and soul were sundered. She wished to scream, to buy but a moment in which she could unleash her claws and tear Tequil to ribbons.<br><!--
-->But she could make no sound, for in the fire's light, the silent soul to whom this body once belonged awakened. And that soul cried out to his brother:<br><!--
-->"I do not wish to see your blood be reduced to ash, but I have seen the light of your heart and spirit. Remember my name, brother. As long as you remember me, I will never have left."<br><br><!--
-->The blazing flames swept over every corner in that gloomy, frigid cavern, and every last poisonous insect within was slain, burned to ash alongside every plot and scheme, so heinous and vile.<br><!--
-->As the last drop of his blood was about to burn away, the roof of the cave above Tequil's head trembled. A fissure opened, and a gem fell down and stopped up his wound.<br><!--
-->The Goddess of Mountains and Fire spoke once more, and her voice echoed across the walls:<br><!--
-->"You yet have one drop of blood. Return to your tribe, for this is your brother's wish, and I will see it fulfilled."<br><br><!--
-->One night, the old shaman who had waited day after day beyond the tribe's bounds stood to welcome the returning Tequil.<br><!--
-->But Tequil refused the water, the food, and the cheers. Instead, he simply said:<br><!--
-->"The venomous snake is slain, and I am victorious. But I shall soon depart along with my brother."<br><br><!--
-->He took the gem from his chest, placed it upon a torch, and walked up to the silent volcano.<br><!--
-->"I have but one drop of blood left, but it was not left for me, but rather, for justice and fairness, for the good and the brave."<br><!--
-->"Use it, and light a fire &mdash; a flame that shall never be extinguished."<br><br><!--
-->Having said that, valiant Tequil leaped into the dead volcano. The earth was shaken by his heart and blood, and the volcano's own heart resumed beating, the blazing lava once more beginning to flow.<br><!--
-->The volcano lives &mdash; as does the bravery of all the tribes.}}
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 36.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I remember there was one line that was super popular at the time. If I still remember right, after being possessed by the Goddess Coatlicue, Rimac said...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 37.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' "I do not wish to see your blood be reduced to ash, but I have seen the light of your heart and spirit. Remember my name, brother. As long as you remember me, I will never have left."
:{{DIcon}} So what about the other version of the story?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 38.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The other version was released only recently. The author heard a suggestion from someone and suddenly decided to try and make a stake in the fairy tale market, so the story was revised...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 39.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' In the revised version, the brothers killed the demon lord together and both survived. According to the author, this gave the story a happy-ever-after kind of ending.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 40.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' However, the revised version was not well-received... After a month on the market, it had hardly sold any copies, and the books were collecting dust on the store shelves.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 41.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The store owners desperately tried to get rid of the book, and have resorted to all sorts of promotions and discounts to sell it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 42.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Even now, the only edition of Tequil the Brave you can find on the market is the newer one, whereas the older edition is nearly impossible to find.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 43.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Anyway, I couldn't bring myself to give such a poorly-rated book to Nechca... So I spent a few days looking, and managed to find a few copies of the old edition in a warehouse.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 44.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I picked out a copy that looked relatively {{sic|new ,and}} wrapped it up as a present for Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 45.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' If you're interested, I can give you this extra copy to read. The pages are pretty old, though, so please be gentle with it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 46.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Oh, and here's a copy of the newer edition, too. They gave me a free copy when I went to buy some [[Xocoatl]].
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's how they're trying to sell off the book... could it really be that bad? Even Paimon's curious now.
:{{DIcon}} That's two more for the collection.
:{{DIcon}} You can read them to me while we're on the road, Paimon.
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 paimon 15b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, but you'll have to carry Paimon for a while. Once Paimon's done reading it herself, she'll read it out for you.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 1 xilonen 47.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Let's get going. Tlazolli lives pretty far from the tribe, so it'll take us some time to get there.

:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 tlazolli 01.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Go on now, Iengu. Nechca is still resting.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 iengu 01.ogg}} '''Iengu:''' *whine*
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Tlazolli, we're here!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 tlazolli 02.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Oh? What a surprise! And even Xilonen is here, too...
:{{DIcon}} We came to visit Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's been a while since I've seen you last, Aunt Tlazolli.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I received Nechca's letter. She wanted a copy of Tequil the Brave, right? I've brought the book for her.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' There are several editions of the book in Natlan, and I wasn't sure which version she'd prefer.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I asked a messenger from the Scions of the Canopy. It seems this softcover edition is one of the most popular options, so I bought it for Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 tlazolli 03.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Heh, you haven't changed a bit, Xilonen.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 tlazolli 04.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Let's go inside. I was just boiling some Xocoatl, so you can all try some.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 tlazolli 05.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Xilonen used to love drinking Xocoatl. When she was little, she would always have several cups every time she came to visit me.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 tlazolli 06.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' You were already a big girl by the time I finally had my Nechca. Alright, for now, let's&mdash;
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 tlazolli 07.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Oof...!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Auntie...? Let's go inside.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' {{Traveler}}, please help me get her into the house.
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon will help, too!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Be good, Iengu, and don't get in the way!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 iengu 02.ogg}} '''Iengu:''' *whine*!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 2 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Alright, let's get indoors. Watch your step now, Auntie.

;(Enter Tlazolli's house)
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 01.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Sorry, Nechca's illness has been flaring up recently, so I was up for a few nights.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 02.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I suddenly started to feel dizzy in the sun... I hope I didn't scare you.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 03.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Have a seat. I'll fetch you a few cups of Xocoatl. Please wait a moment...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I've already brought them over. This cup's for you, Aunt Tlazolli. And these are for you two.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xocoatl... What does it taste like? Paimon's heard that it can be pretty bitter... {{Traveler}}, could you give it a try first?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Don't worry, Auntie always adds lots of sugar. It won't be bitter.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 04.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' The last time you came to visit, you were still just a kid. But now you're a pillar of the Children of Echoes... No, of all Natlan even!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's all thanks to the drinks I had here, and the books I happened to read.
:{{DIcon}} You've been close for quite some time, then?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We heard that you two are from the same tribe... but Paimon had no idea you were so close.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' When I was little, my parents were always talking about how skilled Aunt Tlazolli was at forging Ancient Names, and how she was such a good role model for all the rest of us...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The moment I became idle at home, they would toss me into Auntie's workshop to watch and learn...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 05.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Then your parents would go back, I would boil you a pot of Xocoatl, and let you play in the house.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Then I would have your parents go back, boil you a pot of Xocoatl, and let you play in the house."</ref>
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Yeah. Then I would drink, and listen to you banging away with your tools in the workshop.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But eventually, she moved out of the tribe to find some more space for her workshop,<ref group="Note">"For her workshop" missing in voice-over.</ref> and I didn't have the chance to visit again after that.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But why did you seem so familiar with the place when you went to the kitchen for the drinks just now?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Because the layout of this place is identical to her old house.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Let me see... Ah, that should be Nechca's bedroom, then?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 06.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' That's right. Hehe, I remember you used to hunker down in the room to read and draw...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 07.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' But you're all grown up now... Even if you wanted to live here, I'm afraid you've already outgrown Nechca's bed.
:{{DIcon}} You two seem like family.
:{{DIcon}} Xilonen seems just like an older sister to Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 08.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' That's how Nechca sees Xilonen, too. Whenever she's feeling better, she always asks me when her penpal sister would be coming to visit.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, I'm here now, and even brought a gift as an apology. I'll leave the book here.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 09.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' You said Nechca asked you for the book? I hope it wasn't too much trouble to get... Really, I'm surprised that she even asked you for a present. When she's at home, she'd even ask me for permission to eat some snacks.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 10.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' *sigh* Maybe I've been too strict with her. She's obviously starting to like her big sister more than her own mother!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Really? Well, I'd say I really haven't done enough to deserve the title of big sister.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I wasn't able to help her when she was sick, and I didn't even come and properly visit her that many times. The only thing I've been able to do is to help her find some books.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 11.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Don't be too hard on yourself, Xilonen. You have great responsibilities as the Name Engraver of the tribe. We both know you are far too busy to take care of her.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 12.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' The responsibilities on your shoulders also became far heavier when I... gave up on my work.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You just had more important things to tend to, Auntie... No one in the tribe blames you. We all know that Nechca needs her mother's care.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 13.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' But that doesn't change the fact that I gave up on my work. And... even now, I still have not found the courage to pick up my hammer again.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 14.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I'm sorry to leave you to shoulder all the responsibilities alone, Xilonen.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' ...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, why so somber all of a sudden... Uh, don't be so sad, everyone! Hasn't Nechca gotten better lately?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Relax, Auntie. I can handle the work. But once Nechca is back on her feet, you should get back to work and let me have a vacation.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 xilonen 16.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You'll be the one who's busy then, and I'll be sitting at the side drinking Xocoatl and cheering you on.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 15.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Heh, if that day really comes, you can have as much Xocoatl as you like.
:{{DIcon}} So how did Nechca get so sick?
:{{DIcon}} Is her condition really that serious?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 16.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Hehe... If you asked me before, I wouldn't have even been able to talk about it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 17.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' But now that she's gradually recovering... I've also gained some courage to face what happened back then.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 18.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Nechca's illness actually originates from the Abyss.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 19.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' That night, I was in the tribe, having a discussion over the forging of new Ancient Names.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 20.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Before we could finish our discussion, the alarm started to ring outside. A horde of monsters from the Abyss suddenly attacked the tribe, so everyone banded together to fight them off.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 21.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I joined the fray as well, and it wasn't until the monsters were repelled that I got back home with some guards from the tribe... But Nechca was gone.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 22.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I can't remember how long I spent searching for her... Maybe for two or three days... In the end, we found Nechca at the bottom of a short cliff.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 23.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' She was holding a dried-up Embercore Flower in her hand, and there were traces of Abyssal corruption around her wounds.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 24.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I know... it was all my fault. Before the incident, Nechca had asked if I could forge an Ancient Name for her.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 25.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Work was busy at the time, so I told her that if she could find an Embercore Flower, I would use it as material to forge her an Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 26.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Oh Nechca, my daughter... My Nechca... I was holding her in my arms, but no matter how many times I called her name, she wouldn't open her eyes and look at me...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 27.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I was the one who decided to move my workshop to the outskirts of our tribe for work... and I was the one who left her home alone.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 28.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Oh... *sobs* My daughter, my Nechca... Why do you have to suffer like this? *sobbing*
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa...! Hey, hey... It's okay, right? Nechca's getting better!
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She already has the strength to write letters now, doesn't she? We... Uh well, Xilonen has even brought her a gift!
:{{DIcon}} Please drink some water first.
:{{DIcon}} Things will get better.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 29.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Sorry, I just can't control myself whenever I remember that time.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 30.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Phew, alright... it's not every day that we get guests. I really shouldn't be crying like this.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 31.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I asked someone to buy some ingredients for me, so why don't you stay for dinner tonight? I'll make some Shrimp Bisque, [[Grilled Fish in Mint Sauce]], and Tower Tacos.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll help! That sounds like a lot to make, and we don't want you to tire yourself out.
:{{DIcon}} Let me flex my cooking skills.
:{{DIcon}} Enough talk, let's start with a [[Teyvat Fried Egg|fried egg]]!

:{{A|vo xnnlq003 3 tlazolli 34.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Ah, it just occurred to me that Xilonen likes to eat Cheesy Crab Hotpot. Why don't I make that instead of the Grilled Fish in Mint Sauce? I remember you don't like picking out fish bones.

:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 03.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' They were all pretty simple dishes to make. Don't be shy. Dig in, everyone!
:{{DIcon}} What would you like to start with, Paimon?
::{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon will help herself! Hmm, Paimon will have some of this, and this... oh, and this!

:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You're done already!? Do you even chew when you're eating!?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Of course. Didn't I say that I chew up the fish bones?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'll have just one more fish, and leave the rest for Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 04.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' It's okay, just go ahead and eat all you'd like. Nechca can't eat these dishes anyway.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 05.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Her body is too weak to digest these kinds of things. I'll just make some broth for her.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... But, Paimon thought she had already recovered from her illness.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 06.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Injuries caused by the Abyss cannot be undone. The doctor said the fact that she's stable is already quite a miracle.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 07.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' But it's okay! Nechca can talk to me now, and can even hold my hand... That's more than I could ask for.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 08.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' ...Even if she will never again know that I am her mother.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What do you mean?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 09.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' The doctor said the Abyss has had an irreversible effect on Nechca's soul. She... She's lost all her memories from before she was injured.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 10.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' The doctor also said that this sort of memory loss isn't like simply forgetting something. Rather, she can no longer remember anything from before that fateful day.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But, how does that happen?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 11.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' You know about the woven scrolls that the Masters of the Night-Wind use to record things, right?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 12.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Well, generally speaking, forgetting things is like when the woven scrolls would gradually start to fade. As long as you re-paint and weave the threads again, the faded memories will come back to life.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 13.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' But the case of Nechca's memory loss is as if her woven scroll had been cut in two, and the portion from the past was burned to ashes.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 14.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' The books she loved to read, the flowers she took joy to grow... and the time she spent in this house were all cut off by the Abyss, and can never be retrieved again.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 15.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' As one example of that, Nechca now only sees me as... a strange, unfamiliar Auntie who claims to be her mother.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 16.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' She's a good kid, and doesn't want to upset this lady who's been taking care of her so much, so she still calls me "Mom."
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 17.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' But I've always had a feeling that she's constantly wondering about things like... Where is her real mother? Why is she stuck here in this house? Was she abandoned?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 18.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Nechca really has no idea that her real mother is right in front of her, and has never left...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So, you plan on recreating Nechca's woven scroll all by yourself?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you mean?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Or should I say, you've already started reweaving that scroll long ago?
:{{DIcon}} A Blazegem Inscription...
:{{DIcon}} Whose is it?
:{{Color|menu|Xilonen takes out a Blazegem Inscription...}}
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The delivery guy's. I saw it hanging from his waist, so I asked to borrow it from him.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 19.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' ...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Don't worry. I'll return the Inscription to him once we've figured everything out. These things aren't cheap, after all.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 20.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' When did you know?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I noticed it back when Blazegem Inscriptions suddenly became popular among the tribe.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It was then that I also noticed that everyone wearing Blazegem Inscriptions had varying degrees of memory loss.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' {{Traveler}}, you've picked up on it too, haven't you?
:{{DIcon}} Everyone's memory loss...
:{{DIcon}} Had something to do with Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' "Accessories made using Ancient Name forging techniques"... For what's only supposed to be a pretty souvenir, this Inscription contains a Phlogiston Engraving with a truly overkill level of complexity.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The shape and patterns of these engravings are also identical to that of an Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' By making just a few slight adjustments to the layout and connections of the main pattern, you can pretty much qualify this Blazegem Inscription as a bona fide Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' ...And yet, you've never told anyone about these engravings in the Blazegem Inscriptions that can be activated at any time.

:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 21.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' ...I always knew you were a sharp one, Xilonen.<ref group="Note">"always" missing in voice-over.</ref>
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 22.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' That's right. I have a way to cure Nechca and restore all her memories. It's actually quite simple.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 23.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I want to forge an Ancient Name for Nechca that contains all of her past memories.
:{{DIcon}} You're going to... make an Ancient Name for Nechca?
:{{DIcon}} But Ancient Names must be approved by the Wayob...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 17.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And the reason they must be approved by the Wayob is because the memories they bear are all stored within the Ley Lines.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 18.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Extracting those memories from the Ley Lines requires the Wayob's assistance.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 19.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But your plan wouldn't need you to do any of that, right, Aunt Tlazolli?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 20.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Your Blazegem Inscriptions will help you complete that part of your plan in the Ley Lines' place. You will use the Inscriptions to form a massive memory bank for Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 21.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And the Ancient Name you're trying to forge will be used to extract corresponding memories from the memory bank.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A memory bank? Wait, so the reason all those people were having trouble remembering stuff is because... the Blazegem Inscriptions took away any memories related to Nechca?
:{{DIcon}} Even though Nechca has forgotten her own past...
:{{DIcon}} Her life was still witnessed by other people...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 22.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Using other people's memories of Nechca to reconstruct her past... This is the first time I've heard of such an idea.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 24.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' You've seen through my plans, Xilonen. You're as outstanding as ever... far more brilliant than me.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 25.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I intend to use this method to collate all the memories related to Nechca, and allow her to regain her past again.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' B&ndash;But, wouldn't extracting memories like that hurt the person carrying the Blazegem Inscription?
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 26.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Not at all. Every time a Blazegem Inscription extracts memories, the process is under my precise control. That way, there's no chance of anyone in the tribe getting hurt.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 27.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' This is the Central Inscription that controls all the other Blazegem Inscriptions...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 28.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' ...Which will also soon serve as Nechca's Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You made all this yourself, Tlazolli?
:{{DIcon}} Even though it's not an official Ancient Name...
:{{DIcon}} That's still a lot to do on your own...
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 29.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Yes, it was lots and lots of work... it was truly exhausting. Or perhaps... I've just grown old.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 30.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' You saw it yourself, I nearly fainted just from being in the sun.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 31.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I could collapse tomorrow... or even in the next few moments, but Nechca's Ancient Name is still far from completion.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 32.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I've solved the issue of storing memories, but I still don't know how to connect Nechca up to this Central Inscription.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 23.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I thought you'd just modify your own Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 33.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I considered it, but this matter doesn't have anything to do with my Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 34.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' It's of no help to me, and I don't need its help now.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 xilonen 24.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You know the price to pay for making something like this.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 35.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Yes, I do. But as long as I can get my Nechca back, I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 36.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Otherwise, Nechca won't have any chance of reclaiming her past once I'm dead and gone.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 37.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' She won't remember me, and she won't even remember why her name is Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 38.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' When that time comes, she would be left to drift around the world all alone... unknowing of where she came from, or where she should go.
:{{A|vo xnnlq003 7 tlazolli 39.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' She is my daughter, the one to whom I gave the Nechca name... Whether it be as her mother or as a Name Engraver, I can't simply stand by and let her name disappear.

===Unsorted Dialogue===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tlazolli:''' Hello again! Back for more tea? I can put on another pot.
:{{DIcon}} About "Blazegem Inscriptions"...
:'''Tlazolli:''' Oh? You'd like to know about their... technical details?
:'''Tlazolli:''' As you're friends of Xilonen, I'm willing to share that information with you, yes... Let me pick something simple to start with.
:'''Tlazolli:''' They... Are actually accidental byproducts from my first time forging an Ancient Name.
:'''Tlazolli:''' Then, I accidentally made a mistake with the Phlogiston Engraving of an Ancient Name, creating some kind of "deviation" in the functionality of the Ancient Name.
:'''Tlazolli:''' It could not guide the "memories" and "emotions" that people feel, but rather it could take certain "memories" within itself.
:'''Tlazolli:''' At first, I thought it was utterly useless, so I tossed it in with the other defective products. But after Nechca fell ill, I suddenly thought of this "defective" Ancient Name... which is now known as a "Blazegem Inscription."
:'''Tlazolli:''' ...Nechca lost her memories of the "past." But that past was clearly real... and there are many witnesses to those events.
:'''Tlazolli:''' I can use that Blazegem Inscription to extract memories related to Nechca from the witnesses.
:'''Tlazolli:''' And then, by gathering all those memories together, create an entire "memory bank" about Nechca's past for her.
:'''Tlazolli:''' That way... My little Nechca can come home. She'll remember... that Mama will always be by her side.
:{{DIcon}} About your health...
:'''Tlazolli:''' I do apologize for making you worry, but... It's just as I said. I could collapse at any moment.
:'''Tlazolli:''' In order to forge "Ancient Names," I have paid a high price... Or perhaps I should say, I have given everything I can give, even my little Nechca.
:'''Tlazolli:''' I'm not bitter towards anyone, nor do I expect anything in return... Right now, all I want is to help Nechca get better.
:'''Tlazolli:''' And for that, I will offer everything I have and am.
:{{DIcon}} See you later.
:'''Tlazolli:''' Goodbye. The roads outside are tough going, so please be careful.
