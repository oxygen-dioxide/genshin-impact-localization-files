{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Doolan:''' Don't get any closer to the temple. It's much too dangerous.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Doolan knows; Version 1)
:::'''Doolan:''' Ah, yes. I have encountered some ores nearby. I believe that they're called Magical Crystal Ores?
:::'''Doolan:''' I've heard that these Crystal Ores were formed under the influence of Ley Line energies. They are very hard to come by, and very few smiths know how to work them.
:::'''Doolan:''' You can go have a look if you're interested. I think their locations were...
:::'''Doolan:''' There. I've marked them out on your map. I mean, note-taking is a skill that every adventurer must have, no?
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Doolan knows; Version 2)
:::'''Doolan:''' Now that you mention it, I did see a few shiny ores nearby. Perhaps they're some sort of Crystal Ore?
:::'''Doolan:''' You can go have a look if you're interested, I think they were located at...
:::'''Doolan:''' There, I've marked them out on your map. I mean, note-taking is a skill that every adventurer must have, no?
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Doolan knows)
:::'''Doolan:''' I don't think there's anything of note nearby. If there had to be something... Well, Patchi's changed her hairstyle recently.
:{{DIcon}} What's happened?
::'''Doolan:''' It started off as just an issue of adventuring into the ruins &mdash; my specialty &mdash; but what does it matter now; it's become too layered and complex, and elusive.
::'''Doolan:''' Do you know the feeling? It's like, just when you think you can't see the wood for the trees, suddenly you see a ray of light in the darkness and things take a turn for the better; then out of nowhere the answer is right under your nose. But it morphs again as you try to get a handle on it and suddenly it's got this ephemeral, dream-like quality to it...
::'''Doolan:''' It's more subtle and ambiguous than an adventure &mdash; it's got this really strong romantic vibe, with a hint of danger...
::{{DIcon}} What in the world are you talking about?
:::'''Doolan:''' I do apologize&mdash; I'm an adventurer, and in principle there's no significant difference between an adventure and a chance encounter, but I just can't seem to get a handle on this one.
:::'''Doolan:''' Ms. Patchi is rash and impulsive, so adventuring with her would be high-risk. I worry that she would get injured.
:::'''Doolan:''' But most importantly of all, neither adventures nor chance encounters last forever; in both cases, if you hesitate the opportunity will pass you by.
:::'''Doolan:''' She's so persistent that there's nothing I can do other than to try and make this chance encounter last as long as possible.
::{{DIcon}} You seem like a shady character.
:::'''Doolan:''' Well, when one day you're traveling along and you suddenly come face to face with your destiny out of nowhere... Maybe it'll bring out the shady character in you, too.
:::'''Doolan:''' Adventuring is a romantic pursuit. When I do things like refusing to join the [[Adventurers' Guild]] because of their boring clothes, and stuff like that, it's all because I'm a romantic at heart.
:::'''Doolan:''' *sigh* It looks like it'll take both you and her some time to fully understand this feeling I feel... It's like an epiphany, but clouded somehow...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Doolan:''' There is much more to an adventure than its destination alone, traveler.

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Doolan:''' This is the time of the [[Windblume Festival]], the season when dandelions float about in the wind.
:'''Doolan:''' I've always been looking forward to a time when I might express my love for my destined one amid a sea of billowing dandelions...
:'''Doolan:''' But I never expected Miss Patchi to be too absorbed in her research to understand a thing I was saying...
:'''Doolan:''' Nothing could be more boring than spending such a romantic festival buried knee-deep in books and ruins.
:'''Doolan:''' Who knows how long it'll take for her to understand these deep yet nebulous feelings of mine...
