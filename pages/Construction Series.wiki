The '''Construction Series''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a 4-star [[Weapon Series]].

Each weapons share the following passive abilities:
{{Description|''When the wielder is [[heal]]ed or heals others, they will gain a [X]'s Symbol that lasts 30s, up to a maximum of 3 Symbols. When using their [[Elemental Skill]] or [[Elemental Burst|Burst]], all Symbols will be consumed and the [Y] effect will be granted for 10s. For each Symbol consumed, [Z]. The [Y] effect can be triggered once every 15s, and Symbols can be gained even when the character is not on the field.''}}

Where [X] is a noun/quality, [Y] is an effect name, and [Z] is the set of buffs the equipping character receives after consuming a [X]'s Symbol, depending on the passive name.
