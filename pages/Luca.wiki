==Trivia==
* Similarly to how his companion [[Sonny]] is inspired by {{w|Sonny Corleone}} from the crime film ''{{w|The Godfather}}'', Luca is inspired by the character {{w|Luca Brasi}} from the same film.
* Luca's alias, "The Fisherman," is also a reference to ''The Godfather'', wherein the death of the character Luca Brasi is signified to Sonny Corleone via a "Sicilian message" consisting of a dead, packaged fish.
