|description    = A graceful bird with broad wings and slender legs.<br>The poets of Liyue even use the term "gentleman" to describe this tall and dignified bird. As such, these "gentlemen" pay close attention to proper etiquette and maintain an appropriate distance from strangers. Any sudden movements towards them will only cause them to promptly take flight.<br>[[Paimon]] once asked [[Tubby]] if she'd ever been able to catch one. Paimon explained that she meant no harm with her question, but still Tubby refused to answer.
