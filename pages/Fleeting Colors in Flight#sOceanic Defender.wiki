* Beisht's three heads have separate [[Health|HP]] pools and will attack in conjunction. A defeated head can still attack the player, but will no longer receive damage. When the HP of all three heads reach zero, Beisht will be defeated.
* Unlike the [[Where the Heart Finds Rest (Domain)|story version]], all three of Beisht's heads will start with full health in Oceanic Defender.
* '''Attack 1:''' Conjures 6 orbs of water before launching them at the player, dealing {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.
* '''Attack 2:''' Lunges forward on the platform, dealing {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
* '''Jetstream:''' Lowers its head onto the platform, [[Vacuum Field|sucks]] nearby players towards it before launching a powerful water beam, dealing {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
* '''Attack 4:''' Creates a vortex at the middle of the platform, sucking players towards the center of the arena while dealing {{Color|AoE Hydro DoT}}, before creating a massive splash that deals {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
* '''Attack 5:''' After two heads are defeated, periodically summons waves of water bombs to crash down on the platform, dealing {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
