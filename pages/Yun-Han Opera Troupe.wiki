The '''Yun-Han Opera Troupe''' is the most famous opera troupe in [[Liyue Harbor]]. It is currently directed by [[Yun Jin]].<ref>{{Ref/CS|Yun Jin|Character Details}}</ref>

The troupe currently performs at [[Heyu Tea House]].

==Overview==
At some point in the [[Yun Family]]'s history, they began pursuing Liyue Opera as a family tradition instead of weaponsmithing, which their family was famous for around 500 years ago. By the time of Yun Jin's grandfather, the Yun-Han Opera Troupe was established.

==Trivia==
* While the Yun Family is closely associated with the [[Han Family]], another clan of weaponsmiths in Liyue, the ''Han'' in the Yun-Han Opera Troupe is unrelated to them and uses the character {{lang|mini=1|zh=翰|zh_rm=Hàn}} compared to the Han Family's {{lang|mini=1|zh=寒|zh_rm=Hán}}.
