;(Approach the secretaries)
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baixiao 01.ogg}} '''[[Baixiao]]:''' It's shocking how much work there is to do, even for the three of us...
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baishi 01.ogg}} '''[[Baishi]]:''' And she's been handling it alone all along... The Qixing's secretary clearly isn't an ordinary person. It's so frustrating...
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 01.ogg}} '''[[Baiwen]]:''' Huh. You're...
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aren't you Ningguang's servants? How come you're here?
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baixiao 02.ogg}} '''Baixiao:''' Ahem... We are Ms. [[Ningguang]]'s private secretaries, not servants.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 02.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Have you seen Ms. Ganyu, Traveler?
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 03.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' It has been several days since Ganyu left for Jueyun Karst. She's the General Secretary of the Liyue Qixing, we've only taken over her responsibilities until she gets back...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:{{DIcon}} Why did she go to Jueyun Karst?
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baixiao 03.ogg}} '''Baixiao:''' Ah, even though the Qixing have made peace with the adepti after the latter had denounced Liyue, they still want to pay their respects to the illuminated ones...
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baixiao 04.ogg}} '''Baixiao:''' They commissioned Ganyu as their envoy to deliver a letter to Jueyun Karst and bring the adepti the latest news about the crisis.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baixiao 05.ogg}} '''Baixiao:''' Still... Ganyu should have been back to her usual responsibilities by now, but she's disappeared without a trace.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that so... Maybe Ganyu just took a little detour? Who can blame her, after working so hard?
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 04.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' I'm afraid it's not very likely... Ever since we met Ms. Ganyu, she's been nothing but the most conscientious person in all of Liyue.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 05.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Even when it's time for her annual leave, Ms. Ganyu stays on duty at [[Yuehai Pavilion]], saying that "there is still so much to do."
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 06.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' She couldn't possibly be using her mission as an excuse to slack off.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon sees how it is... But she's half-adeptus. She wouldn't get in trouble, right? Why do you look so upset...
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baishi 02.ogg}} '''Baishi:''' Well... It's because of this absurd workload of hers!
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baishi 03.ogg}} '''Baishi:''' *sigh* When we first heard the three of us would be taking over for Ms. Ganyu, we thought it would simply be a matter of changing our work environment.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baixiao 06.ogg}} '''Baixiao:''' We couldn't have imagined that Ms. Ganyu's daily workload far exceeds what the three of us are used to doing.
:{{DIcon}} Shouldn't you get back to work?
::{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 07.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' We don't even know how long we've been working... We feel guilty for taking even a short breather like we are now.
::{{A|vo gylq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like you've got a serious emergency on your hands.
:{{DIcon}} The adeptus lineage is truly remarkable.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 08.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Speaking of [[Jueyun Karst]], Traveler, I've heard that you can go in and out of there as you please.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course! We've been there lots of times.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baixiao 07.ogg}} '''Baixiao:''' Ah, that's good news... Could you go to Jueyun Karst and find Ms. Ganyu for us? Preferably before we collapse under this workload...
:{{DIcon}} Seems like I'm the only one who can do it, indeed...
:{{DIcon}} I'll do it. Lives are at stake here.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baixiao 08.ogg}} '''Baixiao:''' Phew... We're saved. I remember Ms. Ganyu said that she'd be visiting Cloud Retainer's abode, you might as well start looking for her there.
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baiwen 09.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' It's about time she came back to work, otherwise... *sigh*
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 baishi 04.ogg}} '''Baishi:''' No. Perhaps we should go to Lady Ningguang first and bring up our overtime pay again.

;(After cutscene ends)
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, Ganyu left to visit Cloud Retainer. Doesn't she live in [[Mt. Aocang]]?
:{{A|vo gylq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should hurry up, Paimon hopes we can find her there!

----
;(Approach Ganyu at Mt. Aocang)
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, the person standing over there, that's Ganyu! We finally found her!

;(Talk to Ganyu)
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ganyu! Here you are!
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' You two... I did not expect to meet you here. Is it official or private affairs that bring you here?
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Ah, I shouldn't... I have left the human world. Please contact the Yuehai Pavilion regarding matters concerning the commercial port.
:{{DIcon}} Left the human world?
:{{DIcon}} You seem different...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, you don't want to be the [[Liyue Qixing|Qixing]]'s secretary anymore? But they're all waiting for you to come back...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' That's why you're here? You want me to come back? I'm afraid you came here in vain.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? Did something happen?
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' The clouds fold and unfold, the tide ebbs and flows. It was meant to be.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' When the [[adepti]] entrusted humans with overseeing Liyue, I knew it was only a matter of time until I had to leave.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' My adepti blood makes me unwelcome in Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I delivered the letter and came back to Liyue Harbor only to discover that I had been replaced by Baiwen, Baixiao, and Baishi...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Perhaps that mission of mine was just a pretext to remove me. Since the Qixing gave me a chance to leave with dignity, I decided to be tactful, as well.
:{{DIcon}} I believe there's been a huge misunderstanding.
:{{DIcon}} Nobody wants to get rid of you...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 09.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I appreciate your kindness but there's no need for your words of comfort.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 10.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' After a thousand years away, I came back to Jueyun Karst. Looking at the clouds floating among the mountains brings me peace of mind. I feel better now.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, but...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Who disturbs the peace of these mountains?
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cloud Retainer? We're terribly sorry, we just...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph, one merely jests! One felt your presence the moment you set foot upon this land.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, you adepti really are impressive.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Come here to chat about the old times with Ganyu? It looks like you get along quite well...
:{{DIcon}} Chat about the old times?
:{{DIcon}} Get along?
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 11.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' ...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 04.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Ah... A matter leaves you at an impasse, then?
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 05.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Not to worry, one is exceptional at avenues for conversation. One has been one's own companion in idle talk for many a year.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 06.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Ah, yes. Since you are Ganyu's friends, tales from her youth shall one apprise you of, perhaps...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 12.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Cloud Retainer!
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 07.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hahaha... Nothing to be ashamed of! You were so cute as a child, one is most certain that your friends would like to hear it.
:{{DIcon}} I'm a bit curious, indeed...
:{{DIcon}} Now that's a good topic.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon wants to hear it!
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 13.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Eh...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 08.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hehe... Little Ganyu loved when the horns on the top of her head were caressed.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 09.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' When one was still taking care of her, one was pestered most often to touch her horns. She was else-wise loath to sleep...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 10.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Plump she was, back then! Why, when she stumbled while we ascended the mountain, she would roll down to the bottom like a little ball...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A&mdash;haha!
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 11.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' ...The day Ganyu bumped into a pilgrim was the first time she saw a real human in the flesh.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 12.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' So fearful she was that she hid in a rock's cleft for two days and nights. One found her wailing of a monster she had seen...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hahaha...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 14.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' CLOUD RE&mdash;TAI&mdash;NER!
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 ganyu 15.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' *sigh* Forget it. It's about time for my training. I will take my leave!
:{{DIcon}} I think you upset Ganyu...
:{{DIcon}} It seems you didn't read the room...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 13.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Ah, one's intention was merely to relieve the awkward tension...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And you did the exact opposite. Impressive.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 14.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Be that so? Huh...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 15.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' But returning to Ganyu, most gladdened one is of your arrival.
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 16.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One cannot help but feel that remaining in Jueyun Karst shall not be good for her...
:{{A|vo gylq001 2 cloudretainer 17.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One will tell you more about her, if you should permit it.

::Most benevolent among all adepti are the Qilin
::They drink only spring water and eat only whole grain
::But perhaps the mountainous dwellings of adepti in Jueyun Karst
::Might be too lonely for her human side
::Under moonlight did one see her last
::She stood by the precipice's edge
::And upon the mist-veiled mountains she gazed
::Her thin figure was immersed
::In the vast sea of clouds
::One noticed her loneliness
::And sought to convince her to go back to the human world
::But
::Just then
::She said thus:
::"Liyue Harbor feels"
::"Even lonelier than Jueyun Karst"
::"When I look at the sea of clouds in Jueyun Karst"
::"I merely feel the loneliness of a solitary cloud gazer"
::"When I step into the sea of people in Liyue"
::"I feel the loneliness of an inhuman"
::"That doesn't belong in the human world"
:{{A|vo gylq001 3 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One did, by chance, hear this much of Ganyu's thoughts.
:{{A|vo gylq001 3 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Alone, she will find her predicament hard to conquer. One hopes that you will accompany her...
:{{A|vo gylq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Retainer's right! We can't leave Ganyu depressed like that. Besides, Liyue hasn't given up on her, she's got it all wrong...
:{{A|vo gylq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyways, what's that "training" Ganyu was talking about?
:{{A|vo gylq001 3 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' She has sought to reclaim her adeptus side since returning to Jueyun Karst. At her behest, one has organized training for her to achieve that end...
:{{A|vo gylq001 3 cloudretainer 04.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' She should be in the southern part of Mt. Aocang right now, preparing for the trial.
:{{A|vo gylq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, is that so? Let's go take a look then!

;(Talk to Cloud Retainer again)
:{{A|vo dialog gylq001 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' This trial will test her spirit.
:{{A|vo dialog gylq001 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Even so, one hopes that it shall trouble her little...

----
;(Talk to Ganyu at the southern part of Mt. Aocang)
:{{A|vo gylq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So here you are, Ganyu!
:{{A|vo gylq001 4 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Why did you come here?
:{{DIcon}} We want to keep you company.
::{{A|vo gylq001 4 ganyu 02a 1.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Ah, I... Humans should not remain in the realm of adepti for too long.
::{{A|vo gylq001 4 ganyu 02a 2.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Hmm... Considering the kindness you have shown me, I can let you stay for the adeptus training.
::{{A|vo gylq001 4 paimon 02a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay~!
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to try this adeptus training.
::{{A|vo gylq001 4 ganyu 02b.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Is that so? You really are interested in the ways of the adepti.
:{{A|vo gylq001 4 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' This trial was prepared by Cloud Retainer. Its goal is to help me feel like an adeptus again.
:{{A|vo gylq001 4 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' The training is much to her signature style... I hope it won't make it seem like she is too unaware of the abilities of others.
:{{A|vo gylq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' I&mdash;Is it difficult?
:{{A|vo gylq001 4 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' No, I'm aware of your strength, Traveler. The power hidden within you is not inferior to mine.
:{{A|vo gylq001 4 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' If you're ready, we shall begin the training.

----
;(During the training)
:{{A|vo gylq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a lot of gliding around. It does feel like something Cloud Retainer would come up with.
:{{A|vo gylq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Ganyu's a really awesome shooter.
:{{A|vo gylq001 5 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' If you could see through the eyes of an adeptus, you wouldn't be so surprised.

;(After the training)
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' We've completed the task. What do you think?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps I'd make a good adeptus.
::{{A|vo gylq001 6 ganyu 02a.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I agree. You possess many qualities similar to those of adepti, despite having none of their blood.
:{{DIcon}} Being an adeptus is not easy...
::{{A|vo gylq001 6 ganyu 02b.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Hardships are a fact of life, both for the adepti and humans alike.
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ganyu, what were you planning to do once your training was over?
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' The training's not over yet. The part prepared by Cloud Retainer is only the first trial.
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So there are more trials, prepared by other adepti?
:{{DIcon}} Is Mountain Shaper next?
:{{DIcon}} Is it Moon Carver?
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' No. The only adeptus who can unlock my true potential is...
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who is it?
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' [[Conqueror of Demons]].
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh! So it's Xiao! That cold-hearted loner? How come he's prepared a trial for you?
:{{DIcon}} What a surprise...
:{{DIcon}} How interesting...
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I found him unapproachable at first, too. But I believe... that being able to face him is an important part of my "homecoming."
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' He's already waiting for me. Come along if you're interested.
:{{A|vo gylq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course we are! Let's go, (Traveler)!

;(Talk to Xiao at [[Nantianmen]])
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You're half an hour late... I see you still haven't abandoned the wrongful ways of humankind.
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I'm sorry, I had a meeting with Cloud Retainer, I...
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I don't need your explanations and don't require any mutual understanding between us. I'm just helping you with your training, that's all.
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiao is such a strict teacher.
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You're neither an adeptus, nor a human, always treading the line between the two worlds. It must create a lot of confusion.
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Instead of explaining yourself to me, you should face your true self.
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I... I have nothing to hide.
:{{DIcon}} It seems that Xiao understands Ganyu quite well.
:{{DIcon}} Xiao might be a good teacher after all.
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The body and the mind are one. If something worries your mind, your body can help you find a solution.
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The trial I've prepared for you will explore the true potential of your body.
:{{A|vo gylq001 7 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Yes, I'm ready.

;(Talk to Xiao again)
:{{A|vo dialog gylq001 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Focus on the trial. I'm not here for idle chatter.

;(Talk to Xiao)
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I've completed your trial.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You don't have to report back to me. Seeking other people's validation won't benefit your training.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Only you can evaluate the result of this trial. You'll progress faster that way.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Um... Understood.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiao always has such strong opinions.
:{{DIcon}} He could be nicer while sharing them.
:{{DIcon}} That lone wolf is truly admirable.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' From tomorrow on, I'll start raising the difficulty of your training, so you'll have to...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have to do what?
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Huh... Another one of those pesky visitors...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I'll leave him to you, Ganyu. It's also a part of your training.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pesky visitor? So even here there are those that Xiao can't deal with?
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 01.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' Oh&mdash;Oh heavens! Blessed be [[Rex Lapis]], I've finally come upon the adepti!
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 02.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' Are all of you the adepti of this mountain?
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 03.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' Great! My name's Xin Cheng. I came to ask for your merciful blessings, O adepti! I beg of you, please grant me luck, wealth, and a good career!
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so it's a pilgrim.
:{{DIcon}} Such a materialist...
:{{DIcon}} I can see why Xiao finds his type troublesome.
::{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, he can handle any battle, but talking to strange humans is a different story, huh...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I... am also one of the adepti. You can say that I'm an adeptus in training.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 04.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' Perfect! I didn't come in vain then. Although you sound a bit half-hearted, eh... doesn't matter.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 05.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' What blessings can you grant me?
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, straight to the point, huh?
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Dear... pilgrim, you shouldn't jump to conclusions. Adepti don't help every pilgrim for free.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 06.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' For free? Do you mean that you charge people for the blessings of the adepti?
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Ah, that's not what I meant. What I'm trying to say is that everything should be earned through hard work and earnest living...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' It would be unfair to other people if you got everything you wanted for no reason.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 07.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' Hold on, hold on, I've heard this all before. You're just like my old man, always nagging me...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Your father must've experienced it firsthand. The lives of the common folk are riddled with hardships but are also full of joy.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' A person of your age should focus on work and family, instead of chasing after fairytales.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 08.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' Are you a real adeptus? Why do you speak and behave like us city folk?
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 09.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' You sure you're not one of those swindlers who pose as an adeptus to cheat people out of their money?
:{{DIcon}} He just can't take criticism.
:{{DIcon}} Show some respect!
::{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 10b.ogg}}  '''Xin Cheng:''' Ugh... How dare you reprove me! I bet you came here looking for the adepti yourself!
::{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 07b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, he might sorta have a point. We did come here looking for Ganyu, after all.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 xincheng 11.ogg}} '''Xin Cheng:''' Eh, enough. Doesn't matter if you're a real adeptus or not, you're useless. I'm leaving.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph! Nobody's stopping you!
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 09.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Eh...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ganyu, don't let that guy ruin your mood...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 10.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I&mdash;It's not his behavior. The things he said... He was right.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 11.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I thought that coming back to Jueyun Karst and devoting myself to training would make me feel like an adeptus again.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 12.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But being questioned by him made me realize that I...
:{{DIcon}} Go back to Liyue Harbor with us.
:{{DIcon}} You're better off sticking to your human side.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 13.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But... I'm unwelcome in Liyue Harbor. As an adeptus, I...
:{{DIcon}} We told you it was a misunderstanding!
:{{DIcon}} Can you believe a human like me just this once?
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's true! Just believe us!
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 14.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Eh...
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 15.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Alright, I'll go with you to Liyue Harbor. That said, I still trust my initial judgment.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 ganyu 16.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' If I'm proven right, I'll return to Jueyun Karst once again.
:{{A|vo gylq001 8 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a step in the right direction. Let's go!
