{{Description|A monster created by the coalescing of Anemo dispersed throughout nature.<br />Owing to being comprised of a greater concentration of Anemo, their flotation abilities are stronger than that of Anemo Slimes. The hilichurls living out in the wilds have made use of this special characteristic, creating special vehicles that use Large Anemo Slimes as a form of locomotion to transport goods from unknown sources.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Puff Blow:''' If the player is within melee range, quickly puffs up to deal '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Anemo DMG}} around itself.
*'''Bump:''' If the player is out of melee range, briefly '''inflates''' and shoots itself towards the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.
*'''Wind Blasts:''' Jumps into the air, '''inflates''' and shoots up to 4 Anemo projectiles at the player while floating mid-air, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.
*'''Inflated:''' If the Large Anemo Slime takes DMG while inflated, it will be instantly defeated regardless of the amount of DMG dealt. However, it is still immune to {{Color|Anemo DMG}} in this state.
*'''Final Burst:''' When defeated, releases a burst of wind that [[Vacuum Field|pushes]] nearby players and objects away and triggers Anemo-related effects such as reacting with [[Dandelion Seed|dandelions]] and [[Windwheel Aster]]s, as well as create an upward [[Wind Currents|wind current]] at its location, which can be used to [[Gliding|glide]] up.

==Strategy==
The Large Anemo Slime can be instantly defeated on hit while it is inflated, which can be easily achieved with ranged or [[AoE]] abilities.

Large Anemo Slimes can also be used as a launchpad by jumping on them just before they use their Wind Blast attack. Doing so will shoot a character into the air.
