|text      = While I was out on a stroll recently, I happened to overhear my colleagues talking about giving me a gift. Out of curiosity, I stopped to listen for a while... They seemed unable to decide what style of accessory to go for. Whenever one of them chose something, someone else always suggested something else instead, and so it went on...

I didn't want to be the cause of such trouble for them. When it comes down to it, gifts are just an expression of our friendship. I'd be happy with whatever they got me. I wanted to get closer with my colleagues and thank them for being so considerate, so I've invited everyone out to have dinner together.

Will you come too? If you're free after the meal, I'd like to go for a walk with you as well.
