|description    = This handmade item was created by the members of the [[Zubayr Theater]], and is as true to life as possible.<br />The original plan was also to include the fountain under the stage, the surrounding grandstands, and the shops of the [[Grand Bazaar]], but there were many difficulties in the production process, such as water storage and circulation, the moisture resistance of wooden materials, overall weight control, and so on. After careful consideration, the makers decided to abandon the redundant design and focus all their energy on reproducing the stage.<br />She once said that when there is joy or something to celebrate, people dance, and that is why the stage is a blessing &mdash; may you put it to good use.
