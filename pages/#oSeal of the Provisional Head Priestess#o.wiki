|description    = A stone that is nearly as tall as a person and can be seen in the wilderness of [[Seirai Island]]. The stone is securely tied with a shimenawa, and a Prayer Plaque with a cat's claw design hangs from the shimenawa. The paw print on the top of the stone is particularly clear, and it is said that it is the "handiwork" of [[Neko]], "Provisional Head Priestess of the Asase Shrine." However, the size is too large to be a mark left by that cat...
