'''Piercing Thunderbolt''' is [[Keqing]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Keqing's hair is tied into waist-length twin-tails, topped by small ''odango''-style buns resembling cat ears. There is also a small braid running along the side of her bangs.

Keqing wears a pale lavender top with a high violet collar and ruffled dark blue skirt, layered under a deep violet overcoat, engraved with xiangyun and peacock motifs. The opening of her overcoat is marked by a golden ornament, with white flowers and purple and gold-accented feathers attached. The pattern of the feathers resembles the ones on the dangling backs of her detached long sleeves. In addition, she wears a golden hairpin, a pair of drop earrings, a tasseled choker, and dark gloves with lavender trim.
