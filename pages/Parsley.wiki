:'''Rosemary:''' We can't go on like this. This [[The Fox in the Dandelion Sea|Dandelion Sea]], there's no way to find it, is there?
:'''Rosemary:''' It's a fairy tale, a fantasy. But... should I tell him, or shouldn't I?
:'''Parsley:''' That may be so, but, humans can never leave their fantasies aside.
:'''Parsley:''' Only if we dream can we have hope, and with hope comes opportunity.
:'''Parsley:''' Surely you haven't forgotten that snowy day in Snezhnaya, when you were my [[The Boar Princess|Boar Princess]], and I was your wolf pup?
:'''Rosemary:''' Oh, Parsley... just as we once dreamed to ascend to [[Celestia]]&mdash; No, even now, we...
:'''Parsley:''' Indeed. Even for another moment, let's allow little Sage to enjoy the fantasies of his youth.

==Trivia==
* Parsley, [[Rosemary]], and [[Sage]] are all named after herbs. This may be a reference to the lyrics of the traditional English ballad, {{w|Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair}}, in which the line "Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme" form part of the refrain.
