:'''Eki:''' I am Eki of the Jibashiri. If you are here on unimportant affairs, depart from this place.
-->
;(Talk to Eki<!-- at Yachimatahime's Locus after reaching the Time Tunnel-->)
:'''Eki:''' I am Eki of the [[Jibashiri]]. Hero of Sangonomiya, I acknowledge that you are worthy to take on this challenge.
:'''Eki:''' I am in charge of the trial of "insight." Go forth and solve all the puzzles to return the Flames of the High Gate to their respective places.
:'''Eki:''' The battlefield is ever-changing. Only by keeping your eyes and ears wide open at all times may you grasp the situation and master all these variables.
<!--the following line is not spoken (Version 2.4, Version 2.5)
:'''Eki:''' I will await your completion of the challenge at the Tower of the Three Realms above.-->

;(Talk to Eki after dispersing the flames)
:'''Eki:''' Impressive. You cleared that trial with ease. I, Eki of the Jibashiri, acknowledge your great valor.
:'''Eki:''' Your insight can be said to be sufficient to seek out an eel in the winter.
:'''Paimon:''' And what's that supposed to mean, huh?
:'''Eki:''' Breeding season unagi fry are very, very small. You must exert the greatest visual acuity to see them.
