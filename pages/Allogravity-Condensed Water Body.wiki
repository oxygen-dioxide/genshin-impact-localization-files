'''Allogravity-Condensed Water Bodies''' are structures of water floating hundreds of meters above ground. They are a result of the large explosion that occurred at the [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering]] below them.

Players are able to enter these floating water bodies from all angles and [[dive]] inside them.<ref>[[Version 4.1]] Special Program</ref> If the player nears the edge of the water body, a warning message will appear saying ''Approaching the edge of the "Allogravity-Condensed Water Body."''

During the later stages of the {{Quest|Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble}}, several of them will be tainted by Arkhium reactor condensing components, turning them into dangerous [["Allogravity-Condensed Water Body" affected by energy flow|'''Transformed Allogravity-Condensed Water Bodies''']], discernible by their purple-hued water. However, they will immediately return to their harmless variant after each component has been removed from it.
