|description  = A flowery accessory given away by [[Lyney]] at his magic shows. It is an arrangement of [[Lumidouce Bell]]s, which symbolize parting, and [[Rainbow Rose]]s that represent passion. Parting and passion are two separate perspectives sharing the same nature. What really matters is the present that we are living in.
