==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nizam:''' Hello, I am the Vizier. Do you need any help?
:{{DIcon}} Vizier? What about your name?
::'''Nizam:''' My name is Nizam, and Vizier is my title. I'm responsible for administrative matters in the [[Grand Bazaar]] and [[Treasures Street]] on behalf of the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]].
::'''Nizam:''' ...At least, that's what the official document says.
::'''Nizam:''' In reality, I mostly deal with trivial matters. Anything the [[Sumeru Akademiya#Mahamata|Mahamata]] don't want to deal with gets passed on to me...
::'''Nizam:''' Said something about electing a new [[Grand Conservator]], and things having gotten busier... Just another excuse.
::{{DIcon}} What do you have to deal with?
:::'''Nizam:''' For example, when it comes to the birthday of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], residents nearby would come to the Akademiya to apply for funds to hold the [[Sabzeruz Festival]].
:::'''Nizam:''' But ever since the departure of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], the higher-ups stopped organizing the festival.
:::'''Nizam:''' They're not responsible for dealing with questions and doubts from the residents. In the end, I'm the one who has to smooth things out... I have to handle all kinds of things.
:::'''Nizam:''' But as much as I complain about it, I'm still going to do as I should.
::{{DIcon}} Grand Conservator?
:::'''Nizam:''' Simply put, it's the director of the [[House of Daena]] in the Akademiya.
:::'''Nizam:''' Everyone is free to request knowledge from the [[Akasha System|Akasha]], but the access to some important texts and primary sources requires the approval of the Grand Conservator.
:::'''Nizam:''' So the scholars of the Akademiya are very concerned about this matter.
:::'''Nizam:''' It doesn't matter to me... But [[Vikram]] and I had drinks together, so I can't support him, or else it may look rather suspicious.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing.
::'''Nizam:''' Good to hear that.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nizam:''' Hello, I am the Vizier. Do you need any help?
:{{DIcon}} Vizier? What about your name?
::'''Nizam:''' My name is Nizam, and Vizier is my title. I'm responsible for administrative matters in the [[Grand Bazaar]] and [[Treasures Street]] on behalf of the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]].
::'''Nizam:''' ...At least, that's what the official document says.
::'''Nizam:''' In reality, I mostly deal with trivial matters. Anything the [[Sumeru Akademiya#Mahamata|Mahamata]] don't want to deal with gets passed on to me...
::'''Nizam:''' Said something about electing a new [[Grand Conservator]], and things having gotten busier... Just another excuse.
::{{DIcon}} What do you have to deal with?
:::'''Nizam:''' For example, when it comes to the birthday of the Dendro Archon, residents nearby would come to the Akademiya to apply for funds to hold the Sabzeruz Festival.
:::'''Nizam:''' Ever since Lesser Lord Kusanali reasserted control over the Akademiya, everyone's been ever more fired up about this festival... and the number of requests has also shot up, as you might expect.
:::'''Nizam:''' I mean, I complain about it, but I'm still going to my job as usual.
::{{DIcon}} Grand Conservator?
:::'''Nizam:''' Simply put, this is the director of the House of Daena in the Akademiya.
:::'''Nizam:''' Ever since the Akasha was shut down, the number of people who have wanted to reference book collections has increased, and all such applications must go through the Grand Conservator.
:::'''Nizam:''' As such, the scholars of the Akademiya are very concerned about this matter.
:::'''Nizam:''' It doesn't matter to me... But Vikram and I have had drinks together, so I have to recuse myself from supporting him, or else it may look rather suspicious.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing.
::'''Nizam:''' Good to hear that.

==Event Dialogue==
===A Parade of Providence===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nizam:''' Hello, I am the Vizier. Do you need any help?
:'''Nizam:''' If you wished to see the Interdarshan Championship, then unfortunately, the portion taking part in Sumeru City has concluded.
:'''Nizam:''' ...Hold on, on closer inspection you seem to be that guest commentator.
:'''Nizam:''' My apologies. I thank you for the contributions you made to the Akademiya Extravaganza. It's all thanks to your help that the first round concluded so smoothly.
:'''Nizam:''' But I might have been overindulgent in my praise. I heard the Interdarshan Championship has also encountered similar difficulties before... This time, both the contestants and viewers have been spared any harm. How fortunate.
