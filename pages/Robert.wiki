===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]])
:'''Robert:''' *sigh* Friend, could you please take a look at this and tell me what else I have to do to complete my application?
:{{DIcon}} What's with your application?
::'''Robert:''' I've heard that it's become very troublesome to apply for a visit to Inazuma recently. Therefore, I asked a friend from [[Snezhnaya]] to help me.
::'''Robert:''' I went through much trouble to get the documents ready and came all the way here with a fleet...
::'''Robert:''' In the end, that inspector named [[Yurika]] kept saying that I am still missing some "materials," which need to be added on.
::'''Robert:''' But I don't get it. Apart from these documents, what else do I still need?
::{{DIcon}} Have you... brought your wallet?
::'''Robert:''' Huh, my wallet?
::'''Robert:''' I do have my wallet with me. But I'm not in the habit of putting documents in my wallet. And I've already brought all the things that they need...
::'''Robert:''' *sigh* I've been staying in Ritou for too long. I don't really have any more cash left... If I can't sell my goods in the city, I'll be in trouble...
::'''Robert:''' There isn't much I can do with this small amount of money. I might as well go for a drink at Miss Ryouko's stall.
::'''Robert:''' Miss Ryouko will be able to console me for sure, bless her kind soul.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I can't really help you...
::'''Robert:''' *sigh* That's okay. Thank you for your concern anyway... I will figure out a way...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
:'''Robert:''' Alas, the application still can't be done. It's even more troublesome now...
:{{DIcon}} What's with your application?
::'''Robert:''' *sigh* Let me tell you my story. I'm so unlucky!
::'''Robert:''' Previously, I asked a Snezhnayan friend for help, and prepared all the documents painstakingly. I came a long way here with the fleet...
::'''Robert:''' In the end, I never got the Travel Permit application done because I didn't understand their "handling fee" standard!
::'''Robert:''' Now, the [[Kanjou Commission]] is undergoing an inspection from the authorities, and is no longer asking for exorbitant fees...
::{{DIcon}} I'd consider that an improvement.
:::'''Robert:''' Well, less taxation is always good, but with all these delays, all the documents I prepared beforehand have expired!
:::'''Robert:''' They now all need updating, and I was going to look for my Snezhnayan friend for some help there &mdash; it's funny, you know? I can't contact him at all...
:::'''Robert:''' I've been stuck on Ritou for so long, I'm almost out of Mora on hand. Oh, what am I going to do...
:::'''Robert:''' There isn't much I can do with this small amount of money. I might as well go for a drink at Miss Ryouko's stall.
:::'''Robert:''' Miss Ryouko will be able to console me for sure, bless her kind soul.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I can't really help you...
::'''Robert:''' *sigh* that's okay. Thank you for your concern anyway... I will figure out a way...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:'''Robert:''' Let me see. If I want to set up shop here in Ritou, I'll need these... and these...
:{{DIcon}} Opening a store?
::'''Robert:''' Aye, yes. As you know, the Sakoku Decree has been abolished.
::'''Robert:''' So honestly, I could return to [[Mondstadt]] at any time. But I just can't do it - I mean, how can I just leave Inazuma without having done any business here?
::'''Robert:''' And I've heard the news, you know &mdash; about all the people coming here to Ritou, looking to establish their businesses. That really gets my fingers itching, you know? So... What do you think? Should I give this a go?
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like a good idea.
::'''Robert:''' I know, right? If I can set up early, I might just hit upon some good opportunities first.
::'''Robert:''' But I reckon that my documents are going to need updating first. I was going to ask my [[Snezhnaya]]n friend for help, actually, but I haven't been able to contact him at all...
::'''Robert:''' I been stuck here in Ritou so long. I'm almost out of Mora on hand. Oh, what am I going to do...
::'''Robert:''' You know what? I think I'll just go over to Miss Ryouko's for a drink. She'll be able to console me for sure, bless her kind soul.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you, then.
::'''Robert:''' *sigh* That's okay. I'll figure something out...

:'''Robert:''' I'm quite tired of fretting about the paperwork needed to open a store. Should I just invite Ms. Ryouko to come to the festival with me?
:'''Robert:''' But she's got so many customers right now... Ah, what do I do...
