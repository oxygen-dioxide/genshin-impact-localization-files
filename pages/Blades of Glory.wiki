'''Blades of Glory''' is [[Tartaglia]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Tartaglia wears a gray jacket that is left unbuttoned at the bottom to reveal a belt, attached to which is his {{Hydro}} [[Vision]]. He also wears a red scarf that goes across his chest and over his left shoulder, which becomes infused with a wispy Hydro effect when in the melee stance of his Elemental Skill [[Foul Legacy: Raging Tide]].  Paired with his jacket are gray long pants that run down to his black boots, with one half of both boots folded down, and a chain attached to the right-side boot. He also wears a thigh garter and short gloves.
