==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shuzhi:''' Hello there. Can I interest you in a lovely...
:'''Shuzhi:''' ...You know what, scrap that. If there's something you want, you let me know.
:{{DIcon}} Are you waiting for a customer?
::'''Shuzhi''' A customer, you say?
::'''Shuzhi''' Heh. You don't have to worry about customers, they'll always show up eventually.
::'''Shuzhi''' But some people... Some people keep you waiting a whole lifetime. Heh.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your shop.
::'''Shuzhi''' Well, for starters, this whole area sees very little traffic and I don't sell a lot. But that doesn't bother me.
::'''Shuzhi''' In fact, I reached retirement age a long while ago. The only reason I'm still here is that I'm waiting for someone...
::'''Shuzhi''' I've already waited most of my life, so what difference does a few more days make?
::'''Shuzhi''' Though I'll probably be dead and buried by the the time that silly fool comes to his senses. Heh.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Shuzhi''' Okay. Off you go now, I've been held up long enough as it is.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* After speaking to both Shuzhi and Uncle Liu, it is obvious that she is waiting for him to come and talk to her, while he lacks the confidence to do so.
