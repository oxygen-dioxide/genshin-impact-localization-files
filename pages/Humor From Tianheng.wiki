'''Humor From Tianheng''' is a quest item that can be found in [[Wangshu Inn]].

==First Song==
I watch two village men play chess, they play it terribly. For one of them is lacking skill &mdash; the other, strategy.<br />
A muddled mess of bungled chess upon the board ensues. I claim to watch in ignorance... in fact, I'm quite amused!

==Second Song==
These curious rock formations! All that grows here grows awry:<br />
There's bonsai leaves on bonsai trees that nature bonsified!<br />
From [[Cor Lapis]] to shining jade, to silken shrubs galore, the sights exceed what many aged simpletons can endure.

==Third Song==
[[Jueyun Karst]] houses a second sky, a place that mere mortals cannot spy.<br />
The more that one seeks it, the more it seems true, for the birds and beasts here hail from there too.

==Fourth Song==
White like silk, fine like salt, an exquisite antique is sand.<br />
The rich expel it from their homes, but in mine, I boast that it freely roams.

==Fifth Song==
A sound assails my ears, 'tis waves that crash against the cliff.<br />
Atop the cliff I sleep, and beneath the cliff I fish.<br />
A thoughtless neighbor is that wind god, who tears the sky asunder. For he sends things flying everywhere, and disturbs the people's slumber.

==Sixth Song==
Spring blooms in [[Qingce Village|Qingce]], floral fragrance fills the air. It's times like this I really wish my mom and dad were there.<br />
Silvergrass softly rustles in the cool autumnal breeze. I harvest it to weave new clothes before the winter freeze.

==Seventh Song==
[[Rex Lapis]] erected this mountain and built that bay by the sea.<br />
These stratified cliffs are majestic, and those streets entertain endlessly.

==Eight Song==
Oh, how cool is the shade of the trees when summer's heat sets in! I lie my body on a bed of leaves, in a blanket of breeze ensconced.<br />
Alas, mosquitos show no mercy to my tender skin! In haste, I flee from persecution and head back home at once.

==Ninth Song==
I took an after-dinner stroll at evening by the sea. I stroked my beard in thought and gazed out at the galaxy:<br />
The stars across the sky connect to form a canopy, holding back the moon lest it fall into the sea.

==Tenth Song==
I stopped by [[Feiyun Slope]] to view the merchants' wares:<br />
precious stones of every kind &mdash; from expensive to astronomical.<br />
But why waste [[Mora]] here on rocks, and have none left to spare?<br />
I'd rather spend at [[Yujing Terrace]] on all things gastronomical.
