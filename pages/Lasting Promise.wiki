'''Lasting Promise''' is the fourth part of [[Kamisato Ayaka]]'s [[Story Quest]] [[Grus Nivis Chapter]]: Act I - [[The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit]].

==Steps==
#Head over to the designated area recorded in the notebook
#Search for suspicious places based on the hints
#Investigate the shrubbery on the wall
#*Knock on the Conspicuous Stone Wall once, four times, and seven times
#Open the mysterious box
#Go outside the cave to check the notebook

==Notes==
* After the first step, the description changes as follows:"'A crane brings 1 fresh flower in its beak to decorate my hair, while a white rabbit sews a hemline from 4 rays of moonlight. Dressed appropriately, I face eastward and call out Tsubaki's name 7 times. In the blink of an eye, I am standing on the path that leads to her house.'"
* There are Conspicuous Stone Walls to the north, east, and south of the area. Approaching any of them will trigger Paimon's dialogue and the "Investigate the shrubbery on the wall" step. If an incorrect wall is removed, the step will not change. Paimon's dialogue will not play more than once.

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon arriving at the designated area)
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So a transcendent being lives here?
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Brr... If someone lives here, then why is it so chilly?
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Hmm... I'm asking myself the same question...
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' How strange, I'm quite sure that this is the location my mother wrote about, but... surely...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we got it wrong.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe Tsubaki really is a fox envoy?
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Hmm... I'm starting to have second thoughts...
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But, since we're here, I still think we should go inside and explore in full.
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, makes sense. Who knows, maybe there's a surprise waiting in there for us.
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, um... what does the notebook say, exactly?
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Let me think...
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' "A crane brings {{Color|buzzword|1}} fresh flower in its beak to decorate my hair, while a white rabbit sews a hemline from {{Color|buzzword|4}} rays of moonlight. Dressed appropriately, I face {{Color|buzzword|eastward}} and call out Tsubaki's name {{Color|buzzword|7}} times. In the blink of an eye, I am standing on the path that leads to her house."
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like a fairytale... So your mom would do a little ritual and just like that, Tsubaki would come to meet her?
:{{DIcon}} It does sound a lot like an adeptus, actually.
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I have a feeling that it could be some sort of code...
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 ayaka 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Let's get a little closer before coming to any conclusions.
:{{A|vo aylq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good idea!
----

;(Upon reaching Conspicuous Stone Wall)
:{{A|vo aylq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There are some bushes on the rocks in here. Could that be anything?
----

;(Examine Conspicuous Stone Wall)
:'''Conspicuous Stone Wall:''' This wall looks a bit odd...
:{{DIcon}} Leave without doing anything
::'''Conspicuous Stone Wall:''' The Stone Wall does not react at all...
:{{DIcon}} Knock once
::{{DIcon}} Knock three times
:::'''Conspicuous Stone Wall:''' The Stone Wall does not react at all...
::{{DIcon}} Knock four times
:::{{DIcon}} Knock six times
::::'''Conspicuous Stone Wall:''' The Stone Wall does not react at all...
:::{{DIcon}} Knock seven times
::::'''Conspicuous Stone Wall:''' Some strange sounds can be heard coming from within the stone wall.
:::;(The wall falls away)
:::{{DIcon}} Knock eight times
::::'''Conspicuous Stone Wall:''' The Stone Wall does not react at all...
::{{DIcon}} Knock five times
:::'''Conspicuous Stone Wall:''' The Stone Wall does not react at all...
:{{DIcon}} Knock twice
::'''Conspicuous Stone Wall:''' The Stone Wall does not react at all...

;(If the knocks are successful and the wall is correct)
:{{A|vo aylq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? There's nobody here, just this box... Let's see what's inside!

;(If the knocks are successful but the wall is incorrect)
:{{A|vo aylq004 3 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Strange, there's nothing in here... Let's keep looking around.

;(If the wall does not react at all, including if the Traveler leaves without doing anything)
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's recap what the notebook says. Maybe it'll give us a hint!
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' "A crane brings {{Color|buzzword|1}} fresh flower in its beak to decorate my hair, while a white rabbit sews a hemline from {{Color|buzzword|4}} rays of moonlight. Dressed appropriately, I face {{Color|buzzword|eastward}} and call out Tsubaki's name {{Color|buzzword|7}} times. In the blink of an eye, I am standing on the path that leads to her house."
----

;(Open the Mysterious Box)
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did it open, did it open? Did our "Inazumadeptus" leave any treasure here?
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' What's this?
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Looks like a book.
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' It seems to be another notebook.
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Could it be Tsubaki's notebook...?
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Let's step back outside now. The atmosphere here is different than I'd imagined. Somehow... it makes me a little reluctant to open the notebook.
:{{A|vo aylq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knows what you mean &mdash; reading in low light is really bad for your eyes. C'mon, let's get back outside!
----

;(Go outside the cave to check the notebook)
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' *sigh* Here will do just fine.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's see what the notebook says!
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon bets it's all about mysterious treasure! Ah, so exciting!
:{{DIcon}} Psst, Paimon.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wha is it? Why are you whispering all of a sudden? You're making Paimon nervous...
:{{DIcon}}  Come with me. Let's go over there.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhhh, you want to let Ayaka read the notebook without distraction. Seems whatever's written in there must be pretty major after all.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, um, based on her expression... probably not a treasure map.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, what could it be?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' *long exhale*
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Traveler, Paimon, sorry to keep you waiting so long.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No worries, it wasn't long at all! You're a very fast reader.
:{{DIcon}} Have you finished reading the notebook?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Yes, I have.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I think I ought to share the truth of this notebook with you both.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Even though the contents are completely different than what I was expecting...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Different how? You mean, it wasn't a fox envoy who wrote this?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 09.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Not a fox envoy, no.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' It turns out that Tsubaki's real identity...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 11.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...is my mother herself.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 12.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Surprised? M&mdash;Me too... But that's what it says at the very beginning of the notebook.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 13.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Ahem... "Tsubaki and I are the same person, and yet we are different. When I become Tsubaki, I stop being Kamisato Kayo and become the most ordinary woman in the world."
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 14.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' "What follows in these pages is the ordinary, everyday life of a regular person. Nothing more, Nothing less."
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 15.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' This notebook is, for the most part, a collection of my mother's musings, both private and trivial. All of the things we thought about Tsubaki... were in fact about my mother herself.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... that means that the kimono design, and the international dishes...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 16.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Are things that my mother wished to try, yes.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 17.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I'm sure this all sounds utterly bizarre to you, but to me at least, my mother's behavior is completely understandable.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 18.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Or to put it another way, I... I&mdash;I actually have another side to myself as well.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 19.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I was at a loss for words when I started reading the contents of the notebook... It almost felt like... like someone had looked inside my mind, examined my thoughts, and then written them all down on paper...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ayaka...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 20.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' From the moment my mother married my father, she became the mother of the Kamisato household, and with that came all sorts of duties. At the same time, the prestige of the Yashiro Commission brought its own share of responsibility.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 21.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' On top of that, every action she ever took was seen as representing the Kamisato Clan. People were always watching her. Under such circumstances, she never had much time to do things she really wanted to do.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 22.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' After my parents passed away, Ayato and I took over responsibility for the affairs of the clan. We ran into all sorts of difficulties during that time...  I'm not sure if people outside the clan could ever imagine what it was like.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 23.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Every time I found myself up against a difficult issue, I'd ask myself: Did my mother go through this, too? What would she have done in this situation?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 24.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Maybe it's because it'd been so long since I last saw her, but... somehow, all that was left of her in my mind was the side of her that inspired awe and commanded respect...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 25.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But... my image of her was incorrect.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 26.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' When I read this notebook, I realized... She was just like me. Underneath whatever position she may have held, she was just an ordinary person.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 27.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' She liked pretty kimonos, she wanted to try food from different places, she yearned to see sights she'd never seen before...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 28.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Maybe this all sounds immature to you, but... I feel just the same way. I want to live life not as Kamisato Ayaka, but as an ordinary woman.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 29.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Mother wrote that she'd always wanted to go to a local Inazuman festival. She said that sometimes, on a clear night, if you looked out from our house, you could see lights off in the distance.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 30.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I've seen those lights too! It looks so lively with so many people &mdash; and it's so brightly lit it makes the whole sky glow... Of course, sometimes it does make me a bit anxious from a public order perspective.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 31.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But for someone of my position to just show up at a festival with no warning &mdash; it could be considered improper etiquette. Especially in my parents' generation, when the Yashiro Commission didn't have a particularly close relationship with the populace...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 32.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Even if no one stopped us, the idea of the Yashiro Commission going out into the crowd... It'd certainly draw some strange looks. People would probably start thinking there was a trouble afoot.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 33.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Mother said that she didn't want to put people on edge &mdash; she wanted everyone to enjoy the fun and freedom of the festival... She didn't want to disturb them, and didn't have much free time anyway, so she never went. Not even once.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw... So the kimono design &mdash; that must have been the outfit she planned on wearing if she ever did go to a festival, right?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 34.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' That's right. And sometimes, festivals sell international food. She wanted to try that, too.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 35.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I hope this isn't a disrespectful thing to say, but... I never knew my mother was so in touch with her inner child, haha.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's not disrespectful at all! Paimon thinks your mom was the best of both &mdash; a big softie on the inside and a big sense of responsibility on the outside!
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 36.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 37.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Without knowing it, I've ended up fulfilling several of my mother's wishes already. *sigh* But going to a festival is the one thing that I cannot do for her.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 38.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Perhaps this is one thing that can simply never be.
:{{DIcon}} You've already achieved so many things.
:{{DIcon}} It's not your fault, it's just the way things are.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 39.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I understand.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 40.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...Thank you. I think I realize something now.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 41.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Mother and I are so similar in so many ways. The things she faces are things that I too will go on to face.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 42.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' She chose to place her unfulfilled wishes onto the identity of Tsubaki. As for me... I've already decided.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So you've decided on an alter ego too?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 43.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' No, um...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 44.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I don't plan to do anything like that. I think... I think I will set myself a new goal: To live each day without regrets.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 45.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' So, um... Traveler, I... Ahem...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 46.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Whew, deep breaths, Ayaka, deep breaths...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 47.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' *sigh* Would you be at all interested in checking out an Inazuman festival?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's been dying to go ever since we saw that poster! Paimon would love to go with you Ayaka!
:{{DIcon}} So, you've really never been to a festival?
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 48.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Hey, come on, don't make fun! It's just because I used to have the same concerns that my mother did... but now, I think I don't need to worry about it so much.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 49.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I'm going to be true to myself and fulfill the wish that my mother and I shared. I know that you of all people can understand me going my own way on this...
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 50.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' So... let's do this, you and me! Let's go to a festival together!
:{{DIcon}} I'd love to join you.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to come! Festivals here have loads of tasty snacks too, right? Oh, and fun and games? Hee-hee!
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 51.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...Great! Thanks, you guys!
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 ayaka 52.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' If we head over now, we should still make it in time.
:{{A|vo aylq004 7 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good point, today's the last day, right? What are we waiting for &mdash; let's go!

*For the clues of Tsubaki's home, the quest description is different from what Ayaka says in game. She says: "I am standing on the path that leads to her house" instead.
