|text    = Lately, the other secretaries at [[Yujing Terrace|Yuehai Pavilion]] have been working hard and are handling many of the affairs, so I'm less busy than usual at the end of the year. I'm... not used to having free time, so I find myself not knowing what to do.

I heard that it is a pleasant experience to admire the moon and to clear one's mind over a cup of tea with a friend after work. Would you mind accompanying me under the moonlit breeze tonight?

Please don't feel obliged to agree. Being able to have a quiet and peaceful moment in the midst of my busy schedule has made me very happy.

I've prepared tea that I often drink at Yuehai Pavilion and its complementary ingredients that help soothe the mind. I hope you will like it.
