==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hamawi:''' *sigh* When will [[Mawyo|my second son]] finally get a proper job...?
:'''Hamawi:''' Ah, hello there, sorry about that. How can I help you?
:{{DIcon|GeneralGoods}} What do you have?
::'''Hamawi:''' Various sundries. Feel free to look around.
:;(Opens [[Sumeru General Goods]] shop)
;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:{{DIcon}} What is it?
::'''Hamawi:''' He's not a child anymore. That [[Jut]] is even younger, but he has already settled down. He is just fooling around all day with nothing to do.
::'''Hamawi:''' Even if he could apply for some technical information from the [[Akasha Terminal]] like his brother and use it to find a steady job, that would be fine.
::'''Hamawi:''' But instead, he whiles away the day thinking about all that dangerous and unreliable stuff, and the moment he gets any money in hand, he runs straight to the Exchange. I just don't know what I'm going to do with him...
::'''Hamawi:''' What do you think? How can I get those adventurers to stay away from my son?
;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:{{DIcon}} What's the matter?
::'''Hamawi:''' Well, you know, he's not a child anymore. Jut, who's younger than him, has already settled down and has a good job. But him? He's just fooling around all day with nothing to do.
::'''Hamawi:''' I'd thought that he could apply for some technical information from the Akasha Terminal like his brother and use it to find a steady job, and that would be fine.
::'''Hamawi:''' But now that Akasha's gone, I have no idea what he's going to do, what with him being too lazy to study and all...
::'''Hamawi:''' Now he just whiles the day away thinking about all sorts of dangerous and unreliable stuff, and the moment he has any Mora in hand, he runs straight to the Exchange. I just don't know what I'm going to do with him...
::'''Hamawi:''' What do you think? How can I get those adventurers to stay away from my son?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Hamawi:''' *sigh* What a headache...
