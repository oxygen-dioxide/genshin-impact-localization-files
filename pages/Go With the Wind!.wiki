==Trivia==
* This achievement's name comes from one of [[Aether]]'s [[Traveler/Voice-Overs#Combat|voice-overs]] in English that may play upon using his {{Anemo}} [[Gust Surge|Elemental Burst]].
** Both Travelers have a voice-over matching the name of the achievement in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean because their combat voice-overs are the same lines.
* The previous name of this achievement, ''Earth, Wind, and Fire'', was likely a reference to the {{w|Earth, Wind & Fire|eponymous American band}}.
