'''Weather''' is an [[exploration]] mechanic in [[Teyvat]]. While exploring the world, the weather can shift. Depending on the new weather conditions, special properties will be applied to the environment, to your characters, and to opponents.

==Overview==
The weather throughout Teyvat varies depending on location and time. There are many different weather conditions, ranging from sunny skies to thunderstorms to thick fog.

Weather conditions are tied to areas of the map, so the player can often teleport to a different location to escape certain weather conditions. However, only the weather at the player's current location is rendered, even if the player is only a few steps away from an area with different weather.<!-- easily verifiable with Yashiori Island's thunderstorms before completing Orobashi's Legacy -->

Areas affected by regular weather change over time, while areas affected by special weather conditions, such as areas with Special Environment [[climate]]s, are perpetually affected by a particular weather condition. Areas with unique environmental shifts are not necessarily considered Special Environments but have properties that may override weather conditions; see the [[#Unique Environmental Shifts|Unique Environmental Shifts]] section for more information.

For player convenience, major [[cities]] (the [[City of Mondstadt]], etc.) are usually always sunny/clear unless there is a story circumstance that temporarily changes the weather, such as in the Archon Quest [[Dragon Storm]]. (This is not an in-universe phenomenon.)<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell|quote='''Zhongli:''' Until one drizzly day, as I was strolling along the harbor [...]}}</ref>

When the weather changes or when the player enters an area with different weather conditions from the area they were previously in, the active character's corresponding voice-over line will play if applicable.

==Regular Weather Conditions==
===Sunny/Clear/Cloudy===
Default state for most areas. It has no special properties.

===Rain===
* Characters and opponents get [[Wet]].
* Some fires such as campfires and torches are doused.
* {{Dendro}} objects such as [[grass]] cannot be burned during rain.
* In extremely rare circumstances, a double rainbow may appear during or after rain.
* [[Wildlife]] will not appear, even in sheltered areas (e.g. inside a cave)
* Cannot occur in city areas, even if the surrounding area is raining.

===Thunderstorm===
{{See also|Lightning}}
* All rain conditions apply.
* Players, allies, enemies, wildlife, and the environment can be struck by [[lightning]]. (Grants the "[[Wrath of the Gods]]" achievement if the lightning strikes the player.)
* Player may gain [[Electro]] particles.
* There are three [[climate]]s with perpetual Thunderstorms:
**[[A Nation Closed by Thunder]], found around the entirety of [[Inazuma]] prior to the completion of [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter|Transient Dreams]]
** [[Tatarigami]], found on [[Yashiori Island]] prior to the completion of [[Orobashi's Legacy]]
** [[Amakumo Peak]], prior to the completion of [[Seirai Stormchasers: Part IV]]

==Special Weather Conditions==
{{See also|Climate}}
The following weather conditions are found in Special Environment areas.
===Snowy===
Snowy weather is only encountered in [[Subzero Climate]], which currently affects only [[Dragonspine]].

While in snowy areas, [[Sheer Cold]] will accumulate.

===Snowstorm===
Snowstorms are only encountered in [[Subzero Climate]], which currently affects only [[Dragonspine]].

The base [[Sheer Cold]] accumulation rate is 2.5Ã— higher. [[Goulash]] also has no effect during Snowstorms; it is unknown whether this is a bug or a feature.

===Fog===
{{See also|Fog|Glimmering Beacon}}
Fog is a temporary phenomena that reduces visibility. It appears in [[Golden Apple Archipelago]]. Sailing too far into the fog while on the [[Waverider]] will cause one to respawn at the last activated [[Glimmering Beacon]]. Once all the Teleport Waypoints are activated, the fog disappears.

Fog also appears in [[Tsurumi Island]]. Players who venture too far or for too long into the fog will be teleported away. Once the [[Through the Mists]] quest series is completed, the fog will be lifted.

==Unique Environmental Shifts==
{{Stub|many missing shifts: pyro regisvine? cryo regisvine? starglow cavern (also different?)? nameless island; tsurumi island prior to dispelling the fog; thunder sakura roots, especially prior to cleansing them in [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]]; and more}}
"Unique environmental shifts" ''(unofficial term)'' refers to observable phenomena during which the environment, and usually the sky in particular, abruptly changes within a few seconds upon entering the vicinity of a certain area. These effects dispel upon reaching a certain distance from the area or by completing certain actions, although the range required to dispel the effect is typically wider than the area in which the effect is applied. (For example, the gray sky at [[Cuijue Slope]] is applied upon entering the vicinity of the Nine Pillars. However, from the Nine Pillars, one has to move further away from the area before the sky will begin returning to normal.)

Most areas with unique environmental shifts do not distinguish between daytime and nighttime. Sometimes, they will apply a Special Environment climate or will otherwise override regular weather conditions (for example, [[Andrius]]' arena will never experience rain while the shift is in place, even if it is raining in Wolvendom). In some cases, particularly when there is no observable difference between daytime and nighttime, the moon is not visible.

==Trivia==
* As of [[Version 1.5]], when the weather changes (excluding fog), the active character in the player's party will immediately say their voice-over that corresponds to the new weather if it is available. This happens regardless of whether or not the weather change is due to teleporting or otherwise moving to a new area.
** The entire [[Dragonspine]] region except for [[Starglow Cavern]] is considered to have snowy weather.
* When changing the time via the [[Paimon Menu]] within an area with a unique environmental shift where daytime and nighttime cannot be distinguished, the camera will not pan to the sky. When shifting between daytime and nighttime hours, there may be a momentary change in the sky color before returning to normal.
* Like cities, realms in the [[Serenitea Pot]] always have clear skies with no weather. However, unlike cities, this is an in-universe phenomenon.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tubby/Lore|quote='''Tubby:''' This Realm Within has clear and sunny skies all year round. It's not that it can't reproduce the weather outside, I simply enjoy dozing off in the sun.}}</ref>
