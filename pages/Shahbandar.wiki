{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shahbandar:''' Halva, did you lower tax rates for the merchants again?
:'''Shahbandar:''' I told you, don't be afraid to disagree with them. You have to be patient with them, and use the old carrot-and-stick approach...
:'''Halva:''' Uh, with all due respect, I don't think that's the problem...
:'''Halva:''' The majority of the taxes and fees we collect end up as funding for the researchers, but the [[Akademiya]] is hardly strapped for cash.
:'''Halva:''' But putting undue pressure on the merchants isn't conductive to the normal flow of business. So, it doesn't hurt to be more lenient with them...
:'''Shahbandar:''' Don't be naïve! I'll remind you that your job is to collect taxes and fees, not to promote business.
:'''Shahbandar:''' There are other ways of regulating such business matters. It's nothing we of the [[Navbed]] need to concern ourselves with.
:'''Shahbandar:''' You're still an intern, so all you need to do is the job you've been tasked with. Understood?
:'''Halva:''' Y&mdash;Yes...
