|description    = An octagonal censer made of finely polished metal and decorated with intricate hollow patterns. The space inside is sufficient to accommodate a large number of incense materials, and is arranged with a charcoal filter screen to remove the harmful components that may exist in the combustion products. The delicate flue structure facilitates the speedy and easy ventilation of the fragrance. The smoke it produces is too light to be seen by the naked eye and does not disturb the view.<br>Incense is an inconspicuous but abundant thing for life in Sumeru. Researchers often use special incense materials to help them advance their research or enter a meditative state. Ordinary people also have censers in their homes to make full use of the fragrant ingredients, but the materials that researchers and the general public use are said to be completely different, and the former's formulae are kept completely secret from the latter.
