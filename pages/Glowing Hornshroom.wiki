{{Description|A fungus that glows with a faint light in the darkness. It resembles the horn-shaped crest of an [[Iktomisaurus]].<br>According to the storytellers, the first person to combine [[Iridescent Inscription|Phlogiston Engraving]] with oil-painted graffiti was a priest from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]. Despite being a nameless deviant, it was this priest who, having sensed the power that these mushrooms held, decided to collect their fluorescein and mix it with paint. This led to the birth of [[Nightspirit Graffiti]], an art that later spread all across [[Tezcatepetonco Range]].|[[Archive]]}}
