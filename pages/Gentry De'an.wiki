===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Gentry De'an:''' Ugh, what do you want?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...?
::'''Gentry De'an:''' Typical! Young people these days! Care more about what's on their head than what's inside it...
::'''Gentry De'an:''' I'll have you know that ten years ago, everyone from Feiyun Slope down to the Dockyard knew the name Gentry De'an!
::'''Gentry De'an:''' Now? The bank's gone, Chu's gone... It's such a pity! I've lived this long only to watch everything fall apart at the end...
:{{DIcon}} Do you need a hand?
::'''Gentry De'an:''' Hmph! {{MC|m=He|f=She}} wants to lend a hand! And just how do you expect to do that? Raise the dead? Magically recover my lost wealth?
::'''Gentry De'an:''' *sigh* I used to have my own bank... The Minghua Company and the Minghua Bank used to be the two proudest stores on this whole street.
::'''Gentry De'an:''' But then those bankers from [[Snezhnaya]] started descending on the Liyue financial market... All thanks to backing from the [[Fatui]], I might add, not an honest-to-god bootstrapper among them! Anyway... that marked the beginning of the end for the old guard...
::'''Gentry De'an:''' If I was a young man with some fight left in me, oh you can be sure I'd be fighting to make my comeback...
::'''Gentry De'an:''' But there's not much an old man like me can do now.
::{{DIcon}} The Fatui?
::'''Gentry De'an:''' What about them? ...You've never heard of them?
::'''Gentry De'an:''' They came over here from Snezhnaya, flaunting their diplomatic immunity, then they started poking around business circles, putting feelers out... I had a bad feeling about them from the start.
::'''Gentry De'an:''' Then they started interfering with my business... They were intent on getting Snezhnayan investment into Liyue one way or another.
::'''Gentry De'an:''' They were just relentless. Eventually, I had no choice but to sell off the bank to them. And the company? Who knows how much longer it will last. Business is getting worse by the day...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Gentry De'an:''' Hmph, well I hope I won't see you! Stay out of my sight.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Gentry De'an:''' So many medicines, but no cure for heartache...
:{{DIcon}} Is something the matter?
::'''Gentry De'an:''' Hmph... My story has become a byword here in Liyue...
::'''Gentry De'an:''' Not a while back, I opposed my daughter Huachu's marriage to some beggar boy... and my sweet daughter, she threw herself down a well...
::'''Gentry De'an:''' Why, oh why, did she have to fall for that indigent, rat-eyed schoolmaster? Ah, alas!
::'''Gentry De'an:''' She'd rather live a pauper with him than let me arrange her affairs. I said but a few words, and then she... she...
::'''Gentry De'an:''' How could you be so foolish, Huachu...
::'''Gentry De'an:''' And you! Are you trying to rub salt in my wounds? Scram! Get lost! Don't bother me!
:{{DIcon}} See you, then.
::'''Gentry De'an:''' ...Bye.
::'''Gentry De'an:''' ...A father burying his daughter...
