'''Boom Blossoms'''<ref>{{Ref/VO|Albedo|When It Rains}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Pocket-Sized Pine Cabin}}</ref> are a type of [[Obstacle]]. They can be found in the overworld as well as around [[Ley Line Outcrops]] and in some [[Domains]].

When stepped on, the flowers emerge from the ground while spinning around. After 3 seconds, they explode, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Elemental DMG}} of their respective type within a 4m radius. Their explosion will affect both the player and enemies.

Their element can be either {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Electro}}, or {{Dendro}}. While [[Elemental Sight]] is active, Pyro Boom Blossoms will be colored green.

Any attack, including non-damaging hits such as hits from [[Xingqiu]]'s [[Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen|orbiting rain swords]] and [[Yoimiya]]'s [[Niwabi Fire-Dance|skill activation]], can prematurely activate a Boom Blossom.
