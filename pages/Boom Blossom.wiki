'''Boom Blossoms'''<ref>{{Ref/VO|Albedo|When It Rains}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Pocket-Sized Pine Cabin}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Hiding Grazestone}}</ref> are a type of [[Obstacle]] that when stepped on, explode after a short time interval.

When stepped on, the flowers emerge from the ground while spinning around. After ~3 seconds, they explode, dealing damage of their respective element within a certain radius. Their explosion will affect both the player and enemies.

Their element can be either Pyro, Cryo, or Electro. Cryo Boom Blossoms feature especially in [[Dragonspine]], while Electro Boom Blossoms feature exclusively in [[Inazuma]].

Sometimes, they may spawn around [[Ley Line Outcrops]] and in some [[Domains]].

While [[Elemental Sight]] is active, Pyro and Cryo Boom Blossoms will be colored green.

Any attack, including non-damaging hits such as hits from [[Xingqiu]]'s [[Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen|orbiting rain swords]] and [[Yoimiya]]'s [[Niwabi Fire-Dance|skill activation]], can prematurely activate a Boom Blossom, including Electro Boom Blossoms.

==Notes==
*Sword, Claymore, and Polearm users can hit an Electro Boom Blossom like a projectile.
*[[Plunging Attack]]s can manually detonate Boom Blossoms.
