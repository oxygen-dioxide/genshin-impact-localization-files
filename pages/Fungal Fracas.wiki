==Steps==
# Defeat the Fungi

==Request Details==
{{Quest Description|Fungi are raging...}}
===Request from Hawad===
Help Needed:<br />
This is making me pretty mad, alright! When I was moving cargo {{Color|buzzword|near the Apam Woods}}, I was attacked by some {{Color|buzzword|Fungi}} that suddenly emerged.<br />
Most of my cargo was lost and I lost a fair deal of Mora in that transaction.<br />
The Fungi don't hit very hard, but they were a real bother for merchants carrying cargo from afar.<br />
As such, I would be most grateful if someone could help settle this problem.

===Request from Kira===
Help Needed:<br />
I've heard from others at the fishery that {{Color|buzzword|Devantaka Mountain}} play host to a place where many {{Color|buzzword|Fungi}} congregate.<br />
Mischievous and recalcitrant children sometimes go there by boat, and then barely escape with their lives when they come under attack by those Fungi.<br />
This is a pretty worrying trend &mdash; certainly worth the effort for the [[Corps of Thirty]] to send some people to clear those beasties out!

===Request from Pam===
Help Needed:<br />
The area near my fishing spot has, for some reason, been the target of a {{Color|buzzword|Fungus}} infestation.<br />
I can't get rid of them, and they run interference every time I try to mount bait onto my hook. In short, they're just plain annoying!<br />
My business will be affected at this rate, so if someone could get rid of them, I would be most grateful.
