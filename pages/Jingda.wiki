{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jingda:''' *sigh*
:'''Jingda:''' Why am I so unlucky, that of all the people you could have spoken to, you chose me?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Jingda:''' Nothing. Life is exhausting enough by itself. Then there's talking to people, which takes brain power &mdash; and you know what's also exhausting? Using my brain.
::'''Jingda:''' Ah, my existence is so tragic...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry. It's nothing.
::'''Jingda:''' Oh, nothing, is it. Great...
