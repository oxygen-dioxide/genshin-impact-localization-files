{{Description|A lightning-infused flower, somehow spared the fate of being trodden underfoot or reduced to ash by the furious purple fire, making it the sole survivor on the day of disaster.}}
'''Thunderbird's Mercy''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Thundering Fury]].

==Description==
A purple wild flower that survived in the volcanic ash.<br />It witnessed the total decimation of the ancient tribe.

With an innocent's blood, the shaman summoned the [[Thunderbird]].<br />They made their offerings, waiting for the Thunderbird to reveal {{sic|and}} the oracles.<br />However, what descended with the Thunderbird, was the lightning of destruction.

For the transgression against the [[Ruu|young lad]] who sang to it, the sentence was total obliteration.<br />The Thunderbird showed its true nature, wiping the tribe from the face of the earth.
