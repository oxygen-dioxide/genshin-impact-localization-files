'''Special Dishes''' are [[food]] items that have a chance to be [[Cooking|cooked]] if a specific [[character]] makes them. These special dishes provide either a higher bonus or additional effect over their Delicious variant, as well as a separate icon, name, and description.

==Trivia==
* Some characters are able to activate a [[Cooking#Character Bonuses|cooking-related passive talent]] while also cooking their special dish. Due to this, they can double the amount of their special dish created or create an additional Suspicious dish.
** [[Diona]]'s [[Complimentary Bar Food]] may double [[Definitely Not Bar Food!]]
** [[Jean]]'s [[Guiding Breeze]] may double [[Invigorating Pizza]]
** [[Yun Jin]]'s [[Light Nourishment]] may double [[Cloud-Shrouded Jade]]
** [[Nilou]]'s [[White Jade Lotus]] may double [[Swirling Steps]]
** [[Hu Tao]]'s [[The More the Merrier]] may create both [[Ghostly March]] and [[Suspicious Vegetarian Abalone]]
** [[Kamisato Ayato]]'s [[Kamisato Art: Daily Cooking]] may create both [[Quiet Elegance]] and [[Suspicious Sakura Tempura]]
* Some characters do not have a special dish:
** [[Traveler]]
** [[Raiden Shogun]], who cannot cook
* Other than obtaining the character and using them to cook the dish, special dishes are occasionally obtainable through other means:
** [[Birthday]] mails of characters always include at least one of their Special Dish.
** Completing a certain number of [[Hangout Event]] endings award some of the character's Special Dish.
** Uncommonly from other miscellaneous sources, such as [[Der Weisheit Letzter Schluss (Life)|Mona's Special Dish]] being a reward for completing her version of the {{Quest|Owe Mora, Pay Mora}} or [[Encompassing Gladness|Xianyun's Special Dish]] being included in a [[Promotional Code]] reward.
