'''Special Dishes''' are [[food]] items that have a chance to be [[Cooking|cooked]] if a specific character cooks them. These special dishes provide either a higher bonus or additional effect over their Delicious variant, as well as a separate icon, name and description.

The [[Raiden Shogun]] is the only character without a special dish, as she cannot cook.

==Trivia==
* Some characters are able to activate a [[Cooking#Character Bonuses|cooking-related passive talent]] while also cooking their special dish. Due to this, they can double the amount of their special dish created, or create an additional Suspicious dish.
** [[Diona]]'s [[Complimentary Bar Food]] may double [[Definitely Not Bar Food!]]
** [[Jean]]'s [[Guiding Breeze]] may double [[Invigorating Pizza]]
** [[Yun Jin]]'s [[Light Nourishment]] may double [[Cloud-Shrouded Jade]]
** [[Hu Tao]]'s [[The More the Merrier]] may create both [[Ghostly March]] and [[Suspicious Vegetarian Abalone]]
** [[Kamisato Ayato]]'s [[Kamisato Art: Daily Cooking]] may create both [[Quiet Elegance]] and [[Suspicious Sakura Tempura]]
