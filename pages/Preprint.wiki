{{Description|Name: Preprint<br> Note: A device that is akin to a mural. In actuality, it is an accessible two-dimensional space.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/112146 Veluriyam Mirage Adventure Invitation – Introducing the Version 3.8 Limited-Time Area]}}
'''Preprints''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Veluriyam Mirage]] during the [[Secret Summer Paradise]] event.

Each Preprint is associated with a '''Streaming Projector''', which can be activated to enter the 2D world of the preprint. The game interface will essentially turn into a 2D platformer, where the goal is to reach the "exit." The player character is able to interact with certain objects in the preprint environment, such as blocks, moving platforms, and [[Chest]]s.

Placing an object in front of the Streaming Projector in the "real world" will cause a matching object to appear within the preprint. Certain items can be retrieved from the preprint into the real world, such as Chest rewards.

==Lore==
Preprints and Streaming Projectors are the fundamental mechanisms of the Veluriyam Mirage. Everything within the mirage starts out as a preprint, and only becomes a tangible 3D object when illuminated by a Streaming Projector. In fact, the mirage itself is one gigantic preprint, which is illuminated by the "core" Streaming Projector.
