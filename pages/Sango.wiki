==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sango:''' Everything has its cause... And what cause brings you to [[Bantan Sango Detective Agency]] today?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Bantan Sango Detective Agency...
::'''Sango:''' As the name suggests, it's a detective agency that helps people figure out the truth behind cases.
::'''Sango:''' Be it murder, banditry, extramarital affair investigations or pet searches... We can handle any trouble you may have, and I'm not making empty promises here.
::'''Sango:''' Of course, the fees related to our services aren't going to be cheap. So it's best to have the payment ready before coming here.
::'''Sango:''' Let me think. What else do I have to say... Oh, right. I also have a word of advice for you...
::'''Sango:''' Emotion is the enemy of truth, and conscience the burden of knowledge. If you aren't ready to handle the truth, do not cross the threshold of wisdom lightly.
::{{DIcon}} I'm looking for someone.
::'''Sango:''' A family member lost in an attack by an unknown deity... What an interesting case. It's definitely a worthwhile case for our agency.
::'''Sango:''' Hmm... You obtained some clues from meeting them? That makes things easier. Tell me what you know then.
::'''Sango:''' ...
::'''Sango:''' ...Hey, come closer. Best not to let anyone eavesdrop on critical information.
::{{DIcon}} So, are you going out to investigate?
::'''Sango:''' Well, gathering intelligence is [[Ryuuji]]'s duty.
::'''Sango:''' ...Huh? Me? Slack off? No way! Hmph, I think you just don't get it!
::'''Sango:''' Analyzing clues is painstaking work. As the manager at the heart of everything, I just need to patiently wait for the incoming intelligence and analyze them.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sango:''' Yeah, we'll meet again.
