'''Nutritious Meal (V.593)''' is a [[Special Dish]] that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake]] with [[Sucrose]]. The [[recipe]] for Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake is obtained after completing a certain version of the [[commission]] ''[[Food Delivery]]''.

Nutritious Meal (V.593) revives a character and restores '''20'''% of Max HP, then restores an additional '''1,500''' HP to the target fallen character with a 120-second cooldown. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].
