|text      = A few days ago, on my way back from patrol, I overheard Madam [[Faruzan]] tell Master [[Tighnari]] that she's gonna throw me a surprise birthday party &mdash; the grander the better... Master agreed and even wanted to invite [[Cyno]] over!

I guess I'd be okay around familiar faces, but what if they've invited someone I don't know... What's more, how do I act surprised when I already know about the surprise party?

Master and Madam Faruzan must've done a lot, and I don't want to ruin the mood.

Will you come to my birthday party? Could you give me some advice... or back me up in case my mind goes blank?

It really means a lot to me! Please, I need your help!

I usually ask Master Tighnari to check my letters for {{Not a Typo|spel|ing}} errors, but I'm on my own this time. I'm doing... okay, right?
