|vo_01_01_tx         = I am Kujou Sara. You may forget my name, but this you must know: On my watch, [[Inazuma]] will always be defended, and the will of the [[Raiden Shogun|Shogun]] will always be done. Deity or demon, if you make an enemy of me you will be struck down! Oh, ahem... Don't be so nervous. I have agreed to fight by your side, and I will honor that commitment. I may be uncompromising on matters of great importance, but on most other things, you will find me quite easygoing.

|vo_02_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Chat - Duty.ogg
|vo_02_03_tx         = The duty of a [[tengu]] warrior is to watch over the mountains and forests, while that of the [[Kujou Clan]] is to guard Inazuma. These two are of the same ilk.

|vo_04_01_tx         = Good morning...? You mean you only just got out of bed? This is already quite late by my standards. I typically rise well before daybreak.

|vo_05_01_tx         = I am grateful to [[Kujou Takayuki|Takayuki]]. The [[Tenryou Commission]] is all I've ever had to rely on, and I will do everything within my power to defend my family's honor. Hmm? You want to know about the Tenryou Commission's code of conduct? Loyalty to the Raiden Shogun, of course! That is also my life's creed.

|vo_05_02_tx         = Am I ready to depart? Let me put it to you like this. If you were to make a habit of asking me this question every time before you move out, you would find that you only receive an answer from me one time out of 10. The other nine times, I would already be fighting fiercely on the front line. Not because I am foolhardy, nor because I lack courtesy, but because the battle never waits till you are ready.

|vo_06_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Observation.ogg
|vo_06_01_tx         = Though you present an unstable factor in the Almighty Shogun's Eternity, unstable does not have to mean a threat. So I am not your enemy &mdash; but I will be watching you at all times.
|vo_06_01_mention    = Raiden Shogun,Ei

|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Experiences.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = When I confiscated people's [[Vision]]s, I trampled on their ambitions. Now that the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] has been repealed, I must atone for my actions. I am led to believe that you can hear those ambitions...The ones echoing within the Visions embedded on the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God]]? I'd like you to tell me more about them. Also... your own ambitions, I would like to hear about those as well.

|vo_07_01_title      = About the [[Vision]]

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share: Spinning Top
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Spinning Top.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = During a previous assignment, a vendor in Hanamizaka gifted me a kind of spinning top called the "Solo." It's a toy that you can play with when you're by yourself. I was quite taken with it, so I kept it. ...You want to play with it together? But that would defy the principle on which the Solo is based... Respectfully, I must decline.

|vo_07_03_title      = Something to Share: Local Specialty
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Local Specialty.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = Do you know what the most distinctively Inazuman item of all is? No, it is not a blade of any sort. It is a lacquerware carving of the [[Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder]]. They are hand-made by old and skilled lacquerware craftspeople, and nearly every single home in the city has one. My house, you ask? I have five.
|vo_07_03_mention    = Raiden Shogun,Ei

|vo_07_04_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_04_tx         = Whenever something is bothering me inside, I stand beneath the [[Sacred Sakura]], close my eyes, and try to calm my mind. When I open my eyes again, the falling blossoms will guide my path.

|vo_08_01_title      = About [[Thoma]]
|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Thoma.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = The Tenryou Commission's estate is very large. It would serve us well to have a fine housekeeper like Thoma who could keep all the numerous and disparate household affairs in order. If he ever tires of working for the [[Kamisato Clan]], I would very much like for him to come to us... though I doubt that day will ever come.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Thoma

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Kamisato Ayaka]]
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = In the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Kamisato Ayaka

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Yoimiya]]
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Yoimiya.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = As long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know &mdash; all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle. It is transient, but Inazuma is eternal, and my mission is to protect Inazuma.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Yoimiya

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Shikanoin Heizou]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Shikanoin Heizou.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Shikanoin and I may be colleagues, but I have few positive words to say about him. He seems preoccupied with his personal schemes while official duties take second place. The only reason I have not sought to bring him into line so far is that his investigations deliver results...<br>*sigh* He is such a headache.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Shikanoin Heizou

|vo_08_05_title      = About the [[Raiden Shogun]]: Trust
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Raiden Shogun - Trust.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = As I'm sure you've heard many times before, the Almighty Shogun seeks Eternity &mdash; an existence beyond the dominion of thought and longing. "Abandon mortal ties, strive for an unchanging Eternity"... The Almighty Shogun's manner is always resolute, and I do not always fully grasp the meaning of her words. But this is her decision, and I trust her.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Raiden Shogun,Ei

|vo_08_06_title      = About the [[Raiden Shogun]]: Service
|vo_08_06_friendship = 6
|vo_08_01_quest      = Omnipresence Over Mortals
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Raiden Shogun - Service.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = So, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake. She has simply chosen to pursue eternity by a different route. I do not know whether the Shogun has finally found inner peace after protecting Inazuma over all these millennia. All I know is that however perilous the road ahead may become, I will follow her as I have always done.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Raiden Shogun,Ei

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Yae Miko]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Yae Miko.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = Guuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Faction)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her. But... if there ever comes a day when she disobeys the Shogun's will, then please accept my apologies in advance.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Yae Miko

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Sangonomiya Kokomi.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = She is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of. I wonder if I should adopt this technique for commanding the [[Shogun's Army]]? Hmm... but this could lead us to a situation whereby war is waged at the negotiation table, each side with their pack of strategy cards, playing them one by one until a victor emerges... Then again, perhaps not.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Sangonomiya Kokomi

|vo_08_09_title      = About [[Gorou]]
|vo_08_09_friendship = 4
|vo_08_09_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Gorou.ogg
|vo_08_09_tx         = Gorou is to [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] as I am to the Raiden Shogun. He is fiercely loyal, and I have great respect for this. It's a shame we're on opposing sides, so we'll never get to work together... Still, I am glad to have an admirable foe. Also... I hear he's a fifth-born son. That just makes it even better.
|vo_08_09_mention    = Sangonomiya Kokomi,Gorou,Raiden Shogun,Ei

|vo_08_10_title      = About [[Arataki Itto]]
|vo_08_10_friendship = 4
|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Arataki Itto.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = Tsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest [[oni]] I've ever encountered. He showed he was enough of a man to admit defeat, but the rematch he insisted upon... Tsk... To this day, I still don't want to talk about it. If you really must know, you can go and ask him yourself.
|vo_08_10_mention    = Arataki Itto

|vo_08_11_title      = About [[Kuki Shinobu]]
|vo_08_11_friendship = 4
|vo_08_11_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kuki Shinobu.ogg
|vo_08_11_tx         = With her talent and qualifications, it's a shame she decided to join the [[Arataki Gang|Arataki gang]]. I must concede, however, that at the very least, her presence has effectively prevented idlers from stirring up trouble and disturbing the public, reducing the burden on the Tenryou Commission.
|vo_08_11_mention    = Kuki Shinobu

|vo_08_12_title      = About [[Kirara]]
|vo_08_12_friendship = 4
|vo_08_12_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kirara.ogg
|vo_08_12_tx         = Recently, I often feel a mysterious gaze from the shadows that disappears as soon as I turn to look. What an absurd prank... Huh? A nekomata, you say? Huh... She should've just come right up to me if she needed something.
|vo_08_12_mention    = Kirara

|vo_09_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 01.ogg
|vo_09_01_tx         = You want to know more about me? ...Know what, exactly? I can't discuss Tenryou Commission business with you, that's strictly confidential, and I certainly can't divulge anything relating to the Almighty Shogun. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Hmm? Me on a personal level...? I suppose that's not out of the question, just... unprecedented.

|vo_09_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 02.ogg
|vo_09_02_tx         = I lead a relatively simple life when I'm not leading an army into battle. I always get out of bed at 5:05 on the dot. Then I go to the courtyard where I take five deep breaths before walking five laps around it. For breakfast, I typically eat five mouthfuls... Five is my lucky number, so I do things in fives. Do you have some objection to that?

|vo_09_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 03.ogg
|vo_09_03_tx         = The thing that gave me the most trouble when enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree was those officers of the Shogun's Army who would abuse their authority to be heavy-handed with those we detained. The will of the Almighty Shogun must be executed, but I do not condone violence against innocent people! I have expressly forbidden such behavior on countless occasions but judging by the outcome, it seems difficult to root out. If you have any ideas on how to tackle it, please share them with me.

|vo_09_04_tx         = Although I was fully adopted by the Kujou Clan, I know that Takayuki does not look at me the same way he looks at [[Kujou Kamaji|Kamaji]]. I might be a little stone-faced sometimes, but even I get lonely... especially when I catch sight of one of my subordinates sharing an intimate moment with their family. ...<br>I'm sorry, I have nothing but gratitude for Takayuki. How could I be so disrespectful...

|vo_09_05_tx         = Now that I think about it, you and I are a good example of achieving concord through conflict. We were on opposite sides &mdash; diametrically opposed, you could say. I never imagined I would end up alongside you, either in battle or in long conversation... Fate has been kind to me, no, sorry, ignore that.

|vo_10_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Hobbies.ogg
|vo_10_01_tx         = To this day, not a day goes by without bow exercises and target practice. From adopting the stance, to aiming, to hearing the twang of the bowstring, none of this is dry and repetitive for me &mdash; it is about transcending the me of yesterday! I wouldn't call it a hobby so much as a lifelong discipline.

|vo_10_02_title      = {character}'s Troubles
|vo_10_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Troubles.ogg
|vo_10_02_tx         = The existence of a tengu warrior's wings is an objective fact, as is the reality that they will take up a certain amount of space when standing side-by-side. So when you say "come closer," I fail to see how exactly I am supposed to achieve that.

|vo_10_03_tx         = I have always had a preference for easy-to-carry foods that provide quick and ample sustenance, such as [[Onigiri]]. The top choice for replenishing your stamina in the middle of a battle! But that's just a personal preference. I don't dictate what my subordinates have to eat.

|vo_10_04_title      = Least Favorite Food
|vo_10_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Least Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_04_tx         = I generally avoid sweet foods, not that I have a strong aversion to them. Why? Well, sweet things put your mind and body at rest, so if I ever eat sweet things it's easy to...
