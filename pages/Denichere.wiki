==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Denichere:''' Looks like we need to start by repairing its internal structures...
:{{DIcon}} What are you repairing?
::'''Denichere:''' This [[Gardemek]]. [[Heinry]] says it's the Motorized Autonomous [[Fonta]] Vending Machine's bodyguard. He even tried to install a recording device in it...
::'''Denichere:''' But he should stick to making Fonta, it's all he's good at. I'm the only one who knows how to fix things.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You know how to repair meka?
:::'''Denichere:''' I used to work in a project team that built meka, but the project leads kept changing.
:::'''Denichere:''' And every new lead would redo all the work from the beginning.
:::'''Denichere:''' I just couldn't stand it, so I spoke to Heinry and eventually transferred to his Fonta project team.
:::'''Denichere:''' Though I never thought I'd have to fix them again after all this time...
:::'''Denichere:''' Oh, I brought some extra parts that I'm not going to use. Take them, maybe they'll come in handy.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Mechanical Spur Gear|x=3}})
::{{DIcon}} You know Heinry?
:::'''Denichere:''' Yeah. We were both on the research team that developed Fonta.
:::'''Denichere:''' The Institute didn't take the project very seriously and we couldn't get any resources or support... But the work was easy and fun.
:::'''Denichere:''' Of course, when Fonta became a major commercial success the Institute started paying more attention.
:::'''Denichere:''' After that, we founded the Fonta company, with the Institute's support... Although in practice we were managed by the Institute.
:::'''Denichere:''' As for Heinry... All he thinks about is Fonta, so he doesn't care about any of that.
:::'''Denichere:''' But as for me... Ah, forget it. Let's talk about something else.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Denichere:''' Yeah, see you. I need to figure out how to fix this thing...
