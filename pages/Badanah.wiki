'''Badanah''' was a historical figure in the [[Great Red Sand]], [[Sumeru]] who lived thousands of years ago and ruled over several city-states that existed in the desert. He was assassinated by his son [[Faramarz]] and his concubine [[Makhaira]].

==Story==
Badanah was a descendant of the Verdant Lord, [[Zumurud]], who was the son of [[Muzaffar]], one of the Twenty-Nine Deys of Orghana (the city now known as [[Port Ormos]]). The inscriptions found around the Great Red Sand seem to contradict each other on Badanah's ancestry; one inscription claims Badanah was one of Zumurud's fifty sons (assuming the line is meant to be read literally),<ref name="Lamb">Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Valley of Dahri|Valley of Dahri]]</ref> while another claims that "[Badanah's] father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord," which indicates that Badanah was not Zumurud's direct descendant. Regardless, Badanah had a full brother named [[Muzzudin]],<ref name="Lamb" /> and at least another fourteen brothers (or male relatives) who would later all make claims to the throne following his death.<ref>Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Khaj-Nisut|Khaj-Nisut]]</ref>

A later inscription found south of [[Abdju Pit]] is a panegyric which praises Badanah, who by that time was a king, and claims that he is wiser than Muzzudin was.
