:'''Shirai:''' Haha, not bad. Looks like I've got lots of new information...
:{{DIcon}} New information?
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Shirai:''' Exactly, exactly! I've got all the latest scoop on things happening outside Inazuma right here &mdash; the freshest intel, if you will.
:::'''Shirai:''' Have you heard? A giant dragon appeared in [[Mondstadt]] to the north some time earlier.
:::'''Shirai:''' The dragon's wings were enough to blot out the sun, and it sent furious storms whirling right into the center of Mondstadt...
:::'''Shirai:''' Hehe, interested? Well, if you wanna hear more, I'm afraid you're going to have to pay up...
:::{{DIcon}} ...Do you have something more recent to say?
:::'''Shirai:''' Huh... Looks like this batch isn't good enough for you.
:::'''Shirai:''' Well, how about this, then? Did you know? The ancient god who rules over [[Liyue]] lost his life in an unfortunate incident during the annual [[Rite of Descension]]!
:::'''Shirai:''' It all happened so suddenly, and the Rite of Descension suddenly turned into the [[Rite of Parting]]. Was it a natural disaster? Or some kind of plot?
:::'''Shirai:''' Would you like to know more? Well, if you're curious, then you've gotta show your appreciation for such detailed intel, you know?
:::{{DIcon}} ...
:::'''Shirai:''' Huh, why do you look so disinterested? Is my information out of date?
:::'''Shirai:''' Well, I can't help it. Inazuma's been locked down for so long. I had to ask around a lot to find all this intel, you know?
:::'''Shirai:''' Of course, it's all small beans compared to what a person who's seen the world might know, but among the people of [[Watatsumi Island]], such news is in rather high demand.
:::'''Shirai:''' Guess I should do business with locals instead, huh...
:;(After completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Shirai:''' Exactly, exactly! I've got all the latest scoop on things happening in Inazuma right here &mdash; the freshest intel, if you will.
:::'''Shirai:''' I mean, have you heard? The Vision Hunt Decree has been abolished! Those who once had their Visions confiscated can now use their elemental abilities again!
:::'''Shirai:''' You know what? It almost feels like a game, this whole "having elemental abilities" business.
:::{{DIcon}} ...Do you have something more recent to mention?
:::'''Shirai:''' Huh... Looks like this batch isn't good enough for you.
:::'''Shirai:''' Well, how about this then! The Sakoku Decree, enforced for so long, is now finally a thing of the past!
:::'''Shirai:''' Will the re-opened sea routes bring hope? Or more foes?
:::'''Shirai:''' Would you like to know more? Well, if you're curious, then you've gotta show your appreciation for such detailed intel, you know?
:::{{DIcon}} ...
:::'''Shirai:''' Huh, why do you look so disinterested? Is my information out of date?
:::'''Shirai:''' Am I really always so unlucky as to only meet those who are more familiar with Inazuma than me?
:::'''Shirai:''' Looks like I need to be better at reading people... But seriously, who am I supposed to look for at this point? Some tourist who doesn't look like they can tell left from right?
:{{DIcon}} It's fine, thanks.
::'''Shirai:''' Eh, really? You don't need to know?
::'''Shirai:''' Alright then, that's your loss!
