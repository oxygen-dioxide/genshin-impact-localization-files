===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Ishizaki wears a standard uniform modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray ''shitagi'', lavender ''kobakama'', white socks, and ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with pale gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''kote'' (armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is also wearing a {{Lang|''jingasa''|ja=陣笠}} with the crest of the Inazuma Shogunate. He is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'' (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

==Combat Abilities==
Upon spawning, he will act identical to a [[Shogunate Infantry Captain]] in terms of combat abilities and moveset, while also being accompanied by two personal [[Shogunate Infantry]] guards. Once a certain HP threshold has been reached, he will call forth reinforcement units, consisting of another group of four assaulting Shogunate Infantry footmen.

If all of the reinforcement units have been defeated, Ishizaki can rally four more footmen after a period of time has passed.

This ability can be triggered even without dispatching the first two guards, meaning a total of six Shogunate Infantry can be present in this battle at any one time.

If he is defeated, any remaining Shogunate Infantry will instantly despawn, and the quest will progress as usual.
