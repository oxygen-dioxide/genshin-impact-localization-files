{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mister Qi:''' *sigh* Should I borrow that money, or shouldn't I?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Mister Qi:''' Mmm, I suppose I can tell you. Before me is an opportunity that will make me, should it succeed, or break me should it fail...
::'''Mister Qi:''' My friend heard tell from the [[Jade Chamber]] that, if true, could be a sale of a lifetime.
::'''Mister Qi:''' But I lack sufficient capital, and so here I am at the Northland Bank looking for a loan. But there can be no turning back if I borrow this sum...
::'''Mister Qi:''' *sigh* If this information is false, then it would be like falling into a bottomless chasm. The Northland Bank is no lenient creditor...
::{{DIcon}} What's this about the Northland Bank?
::'''Mister Qi:''' Do you mean to ask about how its debtors end up? I doubt anyone could tell you.
::'''Mister Qi:''' I knew someone who fell afoul of the Northland Bank due to his failing business. He fled deep into the mountains and forests to avoid them, but they found him eventually.
::'''Mister Qi:''' I have never heard from him again. No one knows where he has gone.
::'''Mister Qi:''' I don't fear death, but what will my wife and children do without me...
:{{DIcon}} See you again.
::'''Mister Qi:''' You too... This matter cannot be rushed. I must give it more thought, but each moment I wait feels like torture...
