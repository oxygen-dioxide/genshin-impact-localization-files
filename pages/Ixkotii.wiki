==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ixkotii:''' I came here hoping to turn a profit, but I've ended up spending more than I've earned. Though, that's by no means a bad thing.
:{{DIcon}} Been on a shopping spree, then?
::'''Ixkotii:''' How could I not? I thought that applying to leave Natlan on the grounds of making money was never going to work, but [[Pacal|the chief]] approved my request without delay.
::'''Ixkotii:''' As expected, making Liyue Harbor &mdash; with its thriving commercial sector and abundant goods &mdash; my first port of call was the right choice.
::'''Ixkotii:''' Rather than selling my own wares, I'm now far more interested in picking up as much as I can to take home with me when I leave.
::{{DIcon}} Did you find something unexpected?
::'''Ixkotii:''' Ah, I have this little quirk &mdash; whenever I stumble across something new, even if I have no use for it myself, I can't help but want to bring it back for a friend who might appreciate it.
::'''Ixkotii:''' If I see some gadget used to stabilize a boat, I wonder if the [[People of the Springs]] might find it helpful. If I notice an exquisitely embroidered fan, I think of a certain lady from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] who would be happy to own it.
::'''Ixkotii:''' Then there are all the gems I've picked up while wandering the streets and alleyways... I'm already struggling to pack it all up.
::'''Ixkotii:''' But there's so much here that I still want to buy! Which reminds me, I've heard of this rare mineral called [[Plaustrite]]. I wonder where I can buy some...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ixkotii:''' May we meet again!

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Ixkotii name, may be derived from the {{w|Nahuatl}} word [https://nahuatl.wired-humanities.org/content/ixcotl Ixcotl], meaning "cotton palm."
* Her name could also be an abbreviation of ''Ixcotitlan'' ({{w|Nahuatl}}: "between plains," from the prefix [https://nahuatl.wired-humanities.org/content/ixco-0 Ixco] and the locative suffix {{wt|-titlan}}.)
