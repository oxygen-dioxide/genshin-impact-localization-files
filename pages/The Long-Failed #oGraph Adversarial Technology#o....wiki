::{{A|vo wfeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay! That should be all the images we need!
::{{A|vo wfeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head back and check in with Lepine-Pauline. Maybe she'll have an update for us!

;(Approach Charlotte and Lepine-Pauline)

;(If the player did not participate in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who's her friend? And what are they chatting about?
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 01.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' Pretty please with a cherry on top, Charlotte! Journalist extraordinaire! Please tell me you're joking!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 02.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' I read that a gang of criminals tricked the Gardemeks by disguising themselves as Blubberbeasts... It's true, isn't it? It has to be!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 03.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' I've invested all of my savings into Graph Adversarial Technology, and even taken out a sizeable bank loan!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 04.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' I'm begging you! Begging you like the beggiest beggar in all of begdom!
;(If the player participated in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Okay, okay, I need you to calm down a little, Miss Lepine-Pauline...
;(If the player did not participate in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Okay, okay, I need you to calm down a little, Miss Lepine-Pauline...
:{{Introductory Note|Charlotte}}
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I admire your passion for your research, and I don't mean to dash your hopes for those, um... big-ticket orders...
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But... I'm afraid I'm not joking. The Blubberbeast incident was a short story mailed to us by an anonymous amateur author, written in the style of a true story.
:{{DIcon}} Amateur author?
:{{DIcon}} Short story?
;(If the player participated in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Paimon sees what happened here...
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like the "report" Lepine-Pauline read in The Steambird wasn't in the news section after all...
;(If the player did not participate in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... It sounds like they're just discussing a story, but... why does this Miss Lepine-Pauline seem so distressed?
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Funnily enough, I actually remember being in a meeting where the editing team was debating the potential risk of misleading the public with this story. They even went to the Maison Gardiennage for advice.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But to our surprise, they fully supported us printing it. They figured that the false intel would be a great way to dupe potential criminals into wearing ridiculous costumes when breaking the law...
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' In truth, Gardemeks are extremely sophisticated in their capabilities. They can identify criminals just as reliably as the best human Gardes, so a crude disguise isn't gonna get you far. If anything, it'll just make you stand out all the more...
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Since we ran that story, the Maison Gardiennage has made a slew of arrests including, uh... one "Phantom Blubberbeast," a "Titanic Redcrown Finch," and a "Specterman"...
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' So I knew this story had helped out law enforcement, but this is the first time I'm learning of an innocent citizen being deceived by it... And investing so much Mora for nothing...
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 05.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' *whimpering*... Aaaaaah...
;(If the player participated in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh... so Lepine-Pauline's whole research project is based on a fictional story?
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Which means we're not gonna get a big bonus after all?&nbsp;...But more importantly, she's gonna lose everything she's invested...
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! You're back!
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I was in the area taking some photos for a story, when I got talking to Miss Lepine-Pauline about her research. She told me about your collaboration.
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' She was hoping I could write an article to spread awareness about image recognition technology. She even paid me for the article and gave me one of her prototype devices before I could get a word in...
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I unfortunately had to dash her hopes, and I'm afraid all your hard work was in vain, too. She's desperately trying to find a way to rescue the project and get you the Mora you're due... I've tried to let her down gently, but she's finding it all very hard to accept.
;(If the player did not participate in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, she really sounds like she's in pain... Umm... Paimon thinks we should just ask Charlotte what is going on.
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Charlotte!
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! It's you!
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I was in the area taking some photos for a story, when I got talking to Miss Lepine-Pauline about her research.
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' She read an article in The Steambird about a criminal who evaded Gardemek detection by disguising themselves as a Blubberbeast.
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Inspired by this story, she spent a lot of Mora researching counter-criminal image recognition technology. Her aim was to improve Fontaine's public security by developing a device that could enhance Gardemeks' target-recognition capabilities...
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 charlotte 13.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' She was hoping I could write an article to spread awareness about image recognition technology. She even paid me for the article and gave me one of her prototype devices before I could get a word in...
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 charlotte 14.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But unfortunately, it was just a fictional story, and her efforts and aspirations were all in vain... I tried to let her down gently, but she's finding it all very hard to accept.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is a new situation for us, too...
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's such a pity... It seems like the author was only trying to make the story interesting, and the Maison Gardiennage only had Fontaine's best interest in mind...
:{{DIcon}} It's no one's fault.
:{{DIcon}} She is just a victim of a misunderstanding.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 13.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Wait... Miss Lepine-Pauline, what are you doing?
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 06.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' I'm gonna pick a fight with a Gardemek, head to the Opera Epiclese, and get a one-way ticket to the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 07.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' That way, I won't have to repay my debts... It's the only way I can afford to keep on living...
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 14.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Whoa, there's no need to go that far! I mean... Come on, look at you. You wouldn't even dent the Gardemek's armor &mdash; in all likelihood, they'd only hold you up at the Maison Gardiennage for a few days before letting you out. And then you'd still have to repay your debts!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 15.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' ...Actually, instead of going into the technicalities of that... How much did you actually invest? How bad can it really be...?
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 08.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' ...T&mdash;Two hundred and seventy thousand Mora.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 16.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Okay, well... escaping to the Fortress of Meropide over a sum like that seems like a last resort. Surely there must be other options?
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 09.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' Not any more... I used to be an equipment supplier to the Fontaine Research Institute before that blew to pieces, and now I'm just a small-time engineer. I scraped together some savings over the past few years, but I put every last Mora into this project, and now I'm left with nothing!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 10.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' It's not just my savings that are gone. It's my whole future as a Graph Adversarial Technology specialist and my dreams of becoming a billionaire one day!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 11.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' Hah... Haha... Heh... *sobs*
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 12.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' My life is over.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 17.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Don't despair, Miss Lepine-Pauline. I think I know a way for you to turn this around.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 18.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' This prototype you've given me... the "Kamera Lens for Image Recognition Sample Collection" &mdash; it's really quite something. You said you designed it specifically for high-fidelity image capture and analysis, yes?
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 19.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The rapid focal length adjustment is a very useful function in its own right. It's sure to make many journalists' jobs much easier... In fact, I'd say it has the potential to revolutionize Fontaine's news media!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 20.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' So your research efforts thus far are by no means in vain. The technology you've developed may have many applications that you've never even considered.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 13.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' R&mdash;Really?
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 21.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Absolutely! I've been working as a journalist for The Steambird for a long time now. No one understands the issues we journalists face on a day-to-day basis better than me!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 22.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' So keep calm, take heart, and start thinking about mass production. In the meantime, I'll show your invention to all of my colleagues to drum up interest in your product.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 14.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' I can't believe it...
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 15.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' If this is true, then... I can look into setting up a whole Kamera lens development pipeline! My big-ticket orders and billionaire aspirations are still on the cards!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 16.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' Maybe I should consider taking out another loan? That way, I can rapidly improve the lens production process, be the first to market, and prepare to battle for dominance in the Kamera industry!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on! Stop daydreaming about your pipelines for a minute... Just take it one step at a time and see how it goes. There's no sense putting all your eggs in one basket before things are even off the ground.
:{{DIcon}} Being overly ambitious might come back to bite you.
:{{DIcon}} Slow and steady wins the race.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 17.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' Mm-hmm, mm-hmm... And I can probably speak to some people I know and license my image recognition device to a workshop to raise some funds... Ah, I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 lepine-pauline 18.ogg}} '''Lepine-Pauline:''' There's no time to lose &mdash; I need to get to work! Early bird gets the worm!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, can you believe her? She just ran off!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's pretty sure our advice went in one ear and out the other.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 23.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It's understandable... When inspiration and passion strike at the same time, it's all too easy to throw yourself headfirst into your work and forget about everyone around you. A lot of journalists are the same way when they're first starting out.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 24.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But don't you worry. I'm gonna write an article on all this, and I'll be checking in on her regularly.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 25.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Her research has the potential to benefit the entire journalistic community. I'll give her plenty of input to stop her from going down any rabbit holes, and make sure mass production of her lens can begin as soon as possible.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's reassuring to know that you'll be looking out for her, Charlotte!
:{{DIcon}} Go Charlotte!
:{{DIcon}} Star journalist to the rescue!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 26.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Actually... You know what, why don't you two take this prototype lens? I'm sure you'll have plenty of chances to use it on your travels!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 27.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It takes the right person to get the most out of a new technology. In your hands, it's sure to capture some amazing sights.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks a lot, Charlotte!
;(If the player participated in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq002 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No bonus, no biggie! This makes everything worth it.
;(If the player did not participate in the Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log event)
::{{A|vo wfeq003 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a nice surprise. We were just curious about what you guys were talking about &mdash; totally didn't expect to get a free gift out of it!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 28.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You're welcome. I got something out of this too &mdash; the beginnings of a very interesting news story!
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 29.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The boundaries between real news reports and news-like fiction must not be blurred, even when there's a compelling justification for doing so.
:{{A|vo wfeq002 2 charlotte 30.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Yes, that's how I'll phrase it to the editors when I give them my feedback! Let's hope we won't mislead any more well-meaning citizens in the future!
