|description    = The preservation of fresh water is of utmost importance for countryside life. The villagers in [[Konda Village]] have been using such a water tank for more than 100 years. It is made of heavy clay, which is hard and strong, and a tank liner made of fused cast stone, which is said to have a certain self-cleaning effect on the fresh water stored in it.
