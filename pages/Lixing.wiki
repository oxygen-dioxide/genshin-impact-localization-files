: {{DIcon|Idle}} Let's consider another one...
:: {{A|VO Lixing 01.ogg}} "We should consider choosing another transportation plan. "
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lixing:''' Adjustments can still be made to the new delivery plan's transfer point...
:'''Lixing:''' Oh, forgive me. Can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} What are you muttering to yourself about?
::'''Lixing:''' It's complicated... I'll try to give you a summary.
::'''Lixing:''' I work for the Communications Office, and my job is to evaluate and optimize transport plans for designated routes.
::'''Lixing:''' Even if the Communications Office is well-staffed, covering all the transportation work throughout Liyue is quite impossible, which is why we outsource some work to the local Secure Transport Agencies.
::'''Lixing:''' But given how their equipment varies, controlling the transportation times with any precision is a nightmare.
::'''Lixing:''' This, in turn, poses a considerable challenge to our planning capabilities...
::'''Lixing:''' A situation like this will be difficult to turn around in the short term. After all, standardizing their equipment requires a huge investment.
::'''Lixing:''' Local Secure Transport Agencies are usually unable to afford such large sums. They still have to live and eat, right? So, it's up to us to eke a solution out somehow...
:{{DIcon}} Transportation proposal?
::'''Lixing:''' Take this for example. Agency A must transport goods from [[Lumidouce Harbor]] to [[Liyue Harbor]].
::'''Lixing:''' During this process, they transport the goods to the docks between [[Qiaoying Village]] and [[Qingce Village]]...
::'''Lixing:''' They can choose to transport the goods and carts to the opposite shore and continue on land.
::'''Lixing:''' Now, you may have realized that continuing south along the waterway before getting on land at [[Wangshu Inn]] is the superior option!
::'''Lixing:''' But things aren't that simple. The ship traveling down the waterway may not belong to Agency A. It may belong to the Communications Office, Agency B, or independent shipowner C.
::'''Lixing:''' In moments like these, specialized personnel are required to coordinate the transfers between different individuals or organizations. That is the transportation plan I mentioned.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like a lot of trouble...
::'''Lixing:''' Oh, it can't be helped. Getting various groups to cooperate has always been complicated.
::'''Lixing:''' What I mentioned earlier was just the basics. Accounting for the type and time sensitivity of each shipment makes this a dizzying task and then some.
::'''Lixing:''' Let's say the grain output in Chenyu Vale isn't looking good and a large import is required. This would occupy a large part of the transportation capacity available from Liyue's heartlands to Chenyu Vale.
::'''Lixing:''' But the main export commodity here is tea leaves, and its weight characteristics, packing methods, and storage conditions greatly differ from grains.
::'''Lixing:''' Fortunately, my seniors have resolved that issue a long while back. If I had to optimize the transportation of grains and tea leaves...
::'''Lixing:''' My hair would turn completely white within the week!
:{{DIcon}} Good luck, and farewell!
::'''Lixing:''' Th&mdash;Thanks for the words of encouragement! I'll have to give it more thought...
