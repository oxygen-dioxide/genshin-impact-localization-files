{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continues from previous quest)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon slept so well... Mualani and the others seem to be up already. Let's go see what they're up to!

;(Approach Mualani)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mualani!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Just in time, I was about to go look for you.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the... You already caused the whirlpools to reappear again?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We're in luck. The [[Phlogiston]] Nodes were recharged by dawn. I had [[Karya]] and Viramdra control the nodes this time, and we were able to quickly unlock the mechanism.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We were practicing all morning so they could get the hang of controlling them.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? It seems that after apologizing, you've already become trusted members of the team.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Is now really the time to be teasing us? Don't forget that the whirlpools won't last all day.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's right, we really should hurry over to the massive whirlpool again!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Even though we had this discussion yesterday, I still want to double check... You all trust me, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You bet!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 1 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Okay, then let's go!

;(Enter the whirlpool)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *coughing* Paimon accidentally swallowed some water... So scary! Huh, what is this place?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' I can't believe it! There are subterranean caverns under the water!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mualani was right!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's see where this cave leads. Come with me.

:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' According to the map, we need to head downward? Okay, don't be afraid, everyone! Jump down with me!

;(Approach the chest)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that lava up ahead?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It appears these caves were formed by volcanic activity.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' I see... then the [[Spiritway]]s were affecting lava deep underground.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 viramdra 03.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Altering the lava's flow created temporary holes which allowed us to follow the water's current and enter this underground space. Yes, it can all be explained in theory now.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Are all scholars from [[Sumeru]] like this?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hard to say...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 viramdra 04.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' But can there be an island in this kind of underground space?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It appears we haven't reached our destination yet. Let's keep going, everyone.

;(Approach the edge)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, what's that light?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's keep going. We'll be able to see more clearly up ahead.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Watch your step. Follow closely, everyone!

;(Cross the lava pool, optional)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Heads up!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' These volcanic caves aren't very stable, so watch out for falling rocks.

;(Cross the lava pool again, optional)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Careful, more falling rocks!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Seems like this cave is getting more and more unstable by the minute.

;(Reach the next waypoint)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a maze... there's lava everywhere! Which way are we supposed to go now...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's look around together and see what we can find.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Very well. It would indeed be useful to collect some environmental samples here.

;(Investigate the plants)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There are plants growing here?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' There's nothing unusual about that. This is [[Spinel Fruit]], which often grows around places with lava.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Wait, it is a little strange... this isn't ordinary Spinel Fruit. It's the same as the one on this talisman.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Isn't that the talisman your teacher gave you?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yes, in which case, could Uncle [[Nuu]] have been here before? But he clearly told me that he'd never made it to the mysterious island...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I'll be sure to ask him about it once we get back!

;(Observe the lava)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's so much lava, and it's getting pretty hot!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The lava here doesn't look very stable... I'm afraid we can't stay here for long.

;(Approach Karya and Viramdra)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' From here, the light seems to be getting brighter. Speaking of which, where is that light coming from?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' A distant light... Wait, there seems to be a mark that matches that on the map.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Miss Guide, it seems Viramdra has also discovered something...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 3 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' I've got it... I've got it!

;(Talk to Viramdra before investigating everything, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq006 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' I've got it... I've got it!

;(Attempt to follow the path behind Karya and Viramdra, optional)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 2 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' This isn't the way. It will be too dangerous up ahead...

<!--After approaching Karya and Viramdra, proceed directly to next line only if all 3 previous interactions were performed-->
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Do you see that golden light in the distance? I'm positive that's the mysterious island! That's where we should go next!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' I'm a scholar from the [[Akademiya]]'s [[Spantamad]] Darshan. I specialize in ores and minerals.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 03.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' When I first heard about the legend of the mysterious island, I took note of its description.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 04.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' One exaggerated description I heard was that it's "an entire island that shines like gold." What it was actually referring to was an extremely rare mineral known as Vulcanite.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 05.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Under certain environmental conditions, large amounts of lava are quickly cooled, which then results in this ore.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 06.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Since the ore can't be moved in time, it begins to accumulate, resulting in the alluring golden glow...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 07.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' If I'm not mistaken, there'll be a large pool of lava up ahead, and the mysterious island will be floating on the lava! An entire island of Vulcanite ore!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you mean... we really found the mysterious island!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 08.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Rejoice! Even a small piece of that ore will be priceless!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Then let's hurry!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Wait, Paimon. We should head back now.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Why?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 09.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' What are you saying?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' This map is covered with symbols and riddles, but there's one thing that's written clearly. "When you see the golden light, then go the opposite way."
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' What you just said may be correct, but that golden place isn't the island that my ancestors once visited.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 10.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Are you joking? You expect me to turn back now?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Mualani's judgment has always been right... If she says head back, then we should head back. We can't be fooled by the thought of treasure!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 11.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' You thought I'm after treasure? Hahaha...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's acting weird again...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 12.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' After my previous findings were stolen, I began a new area of research... And this ore is the core of my research.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 13.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' As long as I can bring this ore back, my theories will be proven beyond any doubt, and I will be able to reclaim everything I have lost.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 14.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' To me, this ore is the "result" that must be obtained. Otherwise, all those hardships along the way will be rendered completely meaningless! Don't you understand!?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' As we agreed before, please trust my judgment.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 15.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Why? Are you wary of me? Now that we've confirmed that the legendary treasure really exists, you don't want outsiders to take it, do you?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' She's not that kind of person, Viramdra...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 viramdra 16.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' The result is right before my very eyes. I won't give up here!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, he went running in! How could he do that!?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Not good, we must stop him!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or is the ground shaking!?

;(After the conversation)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the... Where did these monsters come from?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' These monsters... Looks like the lava here is becoming active again.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 karya 02.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Miss Guide! Viramdra... he...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 4 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' He'll be trapped by the lava. We need to hurry and take care of these monsters!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The lava is rising...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Viramdra...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' ...{{Traveler}}, Paimon, please take care of Karya. I'll be right back!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you doing, Mualani?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I can use my surfboard on the lava for a short period of time... But it will be a lot spicier than surfing on water...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But that's way too risky!
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} I know she can do it!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Okay, then we'll take care of things here!

;(Talk to Karya, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq006 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' How can I get Viramdra to stop running off?

;(Talk to Paimon, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq006 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, Mualani. We'll take care of things here!

;(While chasing Viramdra)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The cave is becoming more and more unstable... I have to hurry!

:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' More falling rocks? Okay, watch this!

:{{A|vo mlnlq006 5 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Over there! Phew, looks like I'm just in time...

;(Catch up to Viramdra)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' It's right there... I'm almost there!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Look carefully! You can't get through the lava. You'll die if you try to make your way forward. Why don't you just give up?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Why don't I give up? Well, I might not be able to do it, but what about you?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Me...?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 viramdra 03.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' You have the ability to move over the lava. If you try, maybe you can reach the island, and earn the highest honor for a guide!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 viramdra 04.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' That way, you'll have the results you need to prove yourself, and even [[Koolau]] won't be able to question your abilities anymore.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 viramdra 05.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' You want to know why I don't give up, but I'm asking why you'd give up such an opportunity!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The lava is rising! If I take this risk, then how will the others get back? Did you forget? I already gave you my answer.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 viramdra 06.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' You...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Come with me!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 6 viramdra 07.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' No...!
:{{Black Screen|Mualani uses her surprising strength to toss the reluctant Viramdra onto her surfboard.}}
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They're back!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I've brought him back. He's fortunate that he wasn't seriously hurt.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Thank goodness... Thank you so much, Miss Guide!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You're welcome. It's getting dangerous here, so we need to find a way out!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' No, I refuse! I can still stand, let me go back...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously! How can you be so childish at a time like this!?
;(Karya slaps Viramdra)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 karya 02.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Viramdra!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Whoa...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 karya 03.ogg}} '''Karya:''' I've always believed that you're the most talented person I've ever met. Even if your research was stolen and you didn't get any credit, I never doubted it!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 7 karya 04.ogg}} '''Karya:''' I believe that even if you won't obtain any results this time, you'll still succeed in your new research, because no one can take your talent away!

::'''First Chief:''' Congratulations, guide from the future
::'''First Chief:''' You've completed a challenge that even I found ambitious
::'''First Chief:''' And now, I finally have the chance to tell you my story
::'''First Chief:''' You may have heard legends describing me
::'''First Chief:''' As the best guide in all of Natlan
::'''First Chief:''' But in the beginning, I was more like a treasure hunter
::'''First Chief:''' I chased results
::'''First Chief:''' Facing countless dangers to prove myself
::'''First Chief:''' Time after time, I ventured where others didn't dare
::'''First Chief:''' Never failing to bring back rare treasures
::'''First Chief:''' My fame was second to none
::'''First Chief:''' And yet, I never felt satisfied
::'''First Chief:''' So I found a new goal...
::'''First Chief:''' A challenge that no one had ever achieved before...
::'''First Chief:''' The legendary mysterious island. Another chance to prove myself
::'''First Chief:''' Unfortunately, my friends, who had traveled with me all this time
::'''First Chief:''' Had grown tired of my nonsense
::'''First Chief:''' Instead of praise, they now showered me with words of caution
::'''First Chief:''' Perhaps... this journey was one that I had to complete alone
::'''First Chief:''' But luckily...
::'''First Chief:''' They decided to once again put up with my antics
::'''First Chief:''' Just as before
::'''First Chief:''' They came up with ingenious ways to help me move forward
::'''First Chief:''' They never let me down
::'''First Chief:''' Even when I had to place my life in their hands
::'''First Chief:''' And they always trusted my judgment
::'''First Chief:''' Even when it took a lot of courage
::'''First Chief:''' In the end, just as ever
::'''First Chief:''' We found the "result" we came for
::'''First Chief:''' But...
::'''First Chief:''' That golden glow was baiting me towards death
::'''First Chief:''' It was the glow of a rare ore
::'''First Chief:''' But it was also a warning sign of an impending eruption
::'''First Chief:''' Maybe if I pressed on, and put my life on the line
::'''First Chief:''' I could get the result I wanted
::'''First Chief:''' And yet...
::'''First Chief:''' There was a chance I'd lose something even more precious
::'''First Chief:''' But don't worry
::'''First Chief:''' In the end... I made the same choice as you
::'''First Chief:''' Everyone was disappointed
::'''First Chief:''' That the illustrious guide had, for once, returned empty-handed
::'''First Chief:''' But seeing everyone survive
::'''First Chief:''' I felt satisfied for the first time in my life
::'''First Chief:''' Perhaps the treasure I'd really been searching for
::'''First Chief:''' Had been right here with me all along
::'''First Chief:''' So, I decided to end my long journey
::'''First Chief:''' And find a safe place for my hard-earned treasure
::'''First Chief:''' To me, this is the real mysterious island
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The hidden inscriptions disappeared...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' These must have been the words the first chief left for those that would come after him.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In that case, the mysterious island from the legend is actually where the [[People of the Springs]] are living now!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I remember now that the elders once told me our tribe was originally founded on a small island. Later, the coastlines changed, allowing the island to become what it is today.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The journey to the mysterious island starts exactly where it ends...
:{{DIcon}} And just like him...
:{{DIcon}} We didn't return empty-handed.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, I think I understand the choice he made now.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' The golden glow is an indicator of when the lava will periodically erupt... Hmm, if that's the case...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 viramdra 03.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' The principle of Vulcanite formation implies that it will only appear at the start of fierce lava activity... and the flowing lava will quickly swallow it and make it all disappear without a trace.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 viramdra 04.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' This means that there's zero possibility of ever bringing the ore back. Are the results I've been chasing all this time... only an illusion that can be seen from far away?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Viramdra...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Our journey is not yet over. As we agreed, please come back to the People of the Springs with me. Then we'll officially complete this journey.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 viramdra 05.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Fine, I suppose that would also count as some kind of result.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Don't be so down. I have a feeling that the next answer I'm looking for will also be useful to you.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers now! There's still something important we need to ask Mualani's teacher about!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|The truth concerning the mysterious island is finally about to be uncovered. Both you and Mualani need an answer...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Nuu)
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Uncle Nuu, we're back!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 01.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Ah, Mualani... It's good to see you again. I always knew you'd return safe and sound.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Uncle, I've completed the journey to the mysterious island. I'm here to return the talisman.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 02.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' ...But you still have a question you wish to ask me, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yes. You've been there before, haven't you?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 03.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Yes, I have.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' If that's the case, then you've gone on the same journey. But why didn't you tell anyone?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 04.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Because... I made a choice.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A choice?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 05.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Did you notice that the hidden inscriptions on the stone tablet disappeared as soon as you finished reading them?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, you're right...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 06.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' There's a special paint on the statue that would change color when it comes into contact with volcanic dust.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 07.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Only those who have been to that underground space will be contaminated by the dust, and be able to see the hidden message. But once the dust starts to wear off, the hidden inscription will disappear again.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 08.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' And this is the choice that the first chief left to us.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 09.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' If you choose to boast about your deeds, you will receive the highest honor, but the legend of the mysterious island would be destroyed as well.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 10.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' If you choose to remain silent, then the mysterious island will remain a legend, and continue to attract the next generation of young guides to rise to the challenge.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 11.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' In the end, my companions and I all chose the latter.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Ahh... I get it now...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' But not being able to tell anyone after accomplishing such a feat... People like Koolau will still look down on you. Are you really okay with that?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 12.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' But have you noticed that Koolau, who claims to have been to the island, hasn't actually completed the trip?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' What!?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right, Paimon remembers that Koolau said that he went to the mysterious island alone, but there's no way he could've been able to use the Spiritways!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 13.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' He deliberately recommended the client to find Mualani, probably because he thought she wouldn't be able to reach the mysterious island. That way, Mualani wouldn't be able to expose him.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 14.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' As guides, we are not adventurers, let alone treasure hunters. The greatest responsibility of a guide is to take the client to their destination safely.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 15.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' But in the process, we also gain much skill and experience at overcoming danger. This allows us to go to places that no one else can reach, and even find treasures that no one else can find.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 16.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Many guides gradually lose sight of their true beliefs and intentions in the process, and end up becoming like Koolau.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 17.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' They end up becoming more like thieves who would rush to the other side of the lava lake regardless of the consequences, rather than good guides who would turn around and save their friends.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 18.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' This is why the first chief left behind the legend and the map... to lure younger generations into taking up the challenge, thereby teaching them everything he had learned.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 19.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Aside from me, many other tribe members have also traveled to the mysterious island. And just like me, they understood the first chief's intentions.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 20.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' So they've also made pacts with their companions, choosing to give up the results that would prove themselves, and give the younger generation the chance to continue the challenge.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 03.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' You've all given up on the results...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 21.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Sir, I've given up on merely one result. I haven't given up on everything.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 22.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Given her talent and qualifications, Mualani was well within her rights to choose the top-ranked guide Koolau as her teacher, but she chose me.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 23.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' I believe I was able to cultivate such an outstanding student and witness her completion of the legendary challenge precisely because I didn't become someone like Koolau.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 24.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' If instead of looking at one single journey, we look at my entire career as a guide, I'd say I have not returned empty-handed. What about you?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 04.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' ...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 05.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Karya... I've come up with a new research topic. Would you like to continue working as my assistant?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' You're the same as always, Viramdra. You always have to find evidence before coming to a conclusion.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 06.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' I...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 karya 02.ogg}} '''Karya:''' In any case, I can't give you an answer right now.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 07.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Karya?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 karya 03.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Because you haven't prepared the proposal yet. Shouldn't you finish that first before recruiting assistants? How could you forget?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 08.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Ah yes, of course. I'll certainly prepare all the necessary details...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 karya 04.ogg}} '''Karya:''' But, I've always found your proposals fascinating, so I'm sure I won't be able to turn you down this time, either.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 09.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Karya... Given I have been presented with new evidence, I have come up with a very general theory... I can use the ideas from the chief's speech to express it.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 10.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Perhaps the treasure I'm seeking has been by my side the entire time... No, to be more precise, it's been with me even before I set out on this journey.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 karya 05.ogg}} '''Karya:''' I understand, Viramdra.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 25.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' It appears this guest has also found his answer.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems he's finally put two and two together.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 11.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' There's nothing to worry about. It's just like Karya said &mdash; I can start some new research and reclaim everything I've lost.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But it seems he's still as stubborn as before!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 26.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Now it's your turn to make the choice, Mualani.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But Uncle Nuu, I'm sure anyone who can complete the journey to the island would make the same choice, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 27.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Very good. Then there's nothing more I can teach you. Here, take this talisman again. You can pass it on to your student in the future.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 12.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Looks like it's also our time to say goodbye. You've taken great care of us throughout our journey. As thanks, I'm also willing to keep the journey a secret.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Then remember, the next time you come to visit the People of the Springs, you know where to find friends for help.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 viramdra 13.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Friends? I supposed we are theoretically friends now, yes. When I publish my next paper, I'll be sure to add you to my list of acknowledgements.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that's one way to thank someone...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 karya 06.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Then Viramdra and I will be taking our leave. I truly hope we'll get to see you all again someday!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, bye-bye!
:{{Color|menu|Shortly after Viramdra and Karya leave, Koolau comes over to you...}}
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 koolau 01.ogg}} '''Koolau:''' You're back already? So, as Nuu's student, did you manage to find the mysterious island?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What are you doing here all of a sudden?
:{{DIcon}} He must be nervous...
:{{DIcon}} He wants to know if she made it.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well... I found something even more precious than the island... two friends that I can trust with my life!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 koolau 02.ogg}} '''Koolau:''' You... hmph! Seems you've really learned a lot from Nuu about how to make yourself feel better. I knew it... how could anyone ever reach the island with so many {{sic|hinderances}}?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Mm-hmm!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 28.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Haha...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hee-hee!
:{{DIcon}} Hehe!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 koolau 03.ogg}} '''Koolau:''' Huh, wh&mdash;why are you all looking at me like that? The elders in the tribe also gave me that same look. What's that supposed to mean?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 koolau 04.ogg}} '''Koolau:''' Nuu, I've already proven that I'm stronger than you. I've been to even more dangerous places, and found far more precious treasures.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 koolau 05.ogg}} '''Koolau:''' I've even been to... the mysterious island! Why do you still look at me as if my words don't bother you at all?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 29.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' Koolau, even if you had never been to the island, no one would deny your abilities.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 nuu 30.ogg}} '''Nuu:''' But as for what we would deny about you... only you can find the answer to that.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 koolau 06.ogg}} '''Koolau:''' Me? Hmph!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So now our trip to the mysterious island is officially finished, right?
:{{DIcon}} It's time to say goodbye.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 9 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, but I have one more place I want to show you. Come with me!

;(Talk to Nuu again, optional)

:{{A|vo mlnlq006 10 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' This is the place. From what I've heard, if we take a group photo here, it'll bring us good luck. I'm sure of it!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What made you think of taking a group photo?
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 10 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, we completed our trip to the mysterious island together, so of course we need a memento to keep.
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* You've earned the greatest honor for a guide, yet you can only walk away with a photo of your friends. You're pretty amazing, Mualani. You really sacrificed a lot for your tribe!
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 10 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Would you call it a sacrifice? I don't really think so. Actually, after hearing Uncle Nuu's answer, I have this vague feeling that...
:{{A|vo mlnlq006 10 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' After all that we've been through together, the results don't matter anymore... Ah, it's kinda hard to explain, I don't know if you get me or not...
