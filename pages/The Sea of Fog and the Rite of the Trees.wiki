==Gameplay Notes==
* When each perch reaches half health, it will release 6 orbs into the surrounding area. Dissipating these orbs allows for the remainder of the health of the tree to be depleted.
* The orbs are marked on the mini-map. You can also use [[Elemental Sight]] to find them.
*To dissipate the orbs, {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Anemo}}, {{Geo}}, or {{Dendro}} Elemental damage can to be used. {{Color|Physical}}, {{Hydro}}, and {{Electro}} DMG have no effect.
*Enemies that can spawn from the dissipating orbs include:
**{{Enemy|Electro Slime}} and {{Enemy|Large Electro Slime}}
**{{Enemy|Thundercraven Rifthound Whelp}} and {{Enemy|Thundercraven Rifthound}}

==Idle Quotes==
* "What's going on here..." ([[Makiri]])
* "The Perch..." ([[Ipe]])

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|After passing the Maushiro to Sumida, the nature of your commission changes to exploring and investigating Tsurumi Island further. Considering that illusion of Kama you saw, you might need to ask the real one about a few things. With any luck, you might still find him in Ritou.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After the daily reset)
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go check on Kama. Paimon thinks he might have something to do with Tsurumi Island...

;(Talk to Kama)
:'''Kama:''' What's the matter?
:'''Paimon:''' We ran into some very concerning things on Tsurumi Island...
:'''Kama:''' Your point being?
:{{DIcon}} We'd like to know what your relationship with the island is.
::'''Kama:''' That's none of your business.
::'''Kama:''' You've already helped Lady Sumida find the Maushiro, so there is no need for any further association between us.
::'''Paimon:''' Yikes, how cold. Actually, Miss Sumida's commission isn't over yet. She wanted us to continue investigating Tsurumi Island.
::'''Kama:''' Alright. I understand.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? And now he's so willing all of a sudden...
:{{DIcon}} Miss Sumida would like to know more about your relation to Tsurumi Island.
::'''Kama:''' Alright. I understand.
:'''Kama:''' "Kama" is my family's... Just consider it my clan's name. Our ancestor was from Tsurumi Island.
:'''Paimon:''' What!? Why didn't Miss Sumida tell us any of that?
:{{DIcon}} Gasp! Shock! Lightning crackle, lightning crackle!
:{{DIcon}} I'm guessing she doesn't know either.
:'''Kama:''' That's because I never told her.
:'''Paimon:''' But why&mdash;
:'''Kama:''' Because she never asked. If she asked, I would have told her. But since she hasn't, I'm simply her boatman.
:'''Kama:''' I follow her to Yashiori Island to gather reference material. I smuggle snacks from Liyue. I listen to her read books. I think this is a good deal.
:{{DIcon}} So then, about Tsurumi Island...
:{{DIcon}} So, about your ancestor...
:'''Kama:''' My ancestor could not stomach what was happening on Tsurumi Island and left.
:'''Kama:''' So he built a small boat and followed the path of the so-called Thunderbird.
:{{DIcon}} He went to [[Seirai Island]]...
::'''Kama:''' That's right.
:{{DIcon}} And what happened after that?
:'''Kama:''' My ancestors lived on Seirai Island for a long time. Some time later, the Thunderbird destroyed Tsurumi Island, and even later on, it was killed on Seirai. The island became nigh-uninhabitable then, so we migrated to Kannazuka.
:{{DIcon}} Koseki Village and Asase Shrine...
::'''Kama:''' [[Asase Shrine]] was constructed to suppress the Thunderbird's power, or so I heard, while [[Koseki Village]] was built to house those who had relocated to Seirai to make offerings at the shrine.
:{{DIcon}} Kannazuka...
:{{DIcon}} What happened after that?
:'''Kama:''' Our family was lucky enough to survive these various catastrophes, and so we began working in [[Tatarasuna]]. Afterward, having despaired of the way in which the then-inspector acted, my ancestors resigned and moved to [[Narukami Island]].
:'''Kama:''' Previously, we even made a tidy sum of Mora in Ritou doing business... but by the time it came to my father's generation, we had little to our name but a pile of debts.
:{{DIcon}} You really remember history very clearly...
:'''Kama:''' Each generation of our family will tell our story to the one that follows. We have a strong oral tradition.
:'''Kama:''' It is said that this was due to our earliest ancestor claiming that he had given up everything &mdash; save for the reason he had left in the first place.
:'''Kama:''' Before my father passed on, he claimed that we were the last scions of the people of Tsurumi Island, although that hardly counts for much.
:'''Kama:''' We were no illustrious clan, like one might consider the [[Hiiragi Clan|Hiiragi]] or [[Kamisato Clan|Kamisato]] to be. The only thing he left to me was a single small boat.
:{{DIcon}} Why did your ancestor leave Tsurumi Island?
:'''Kama:''' We hold that it is because the Thunderbird showed favor to a certain child, which the priests then decided to sacrifice to it.
:'''Kama:''' Our ancestor could not accept such a thing, so he left. He originally wanted to take the child with him, but it seems that the other party stayed of their own accord.
:'''Paimon:''' That must've been really hard for him...
:{{DIcon}} So the unnatural occurrences on the island...
:'''Kama:''' They must be the result of very large-scale ley line disorder. It is said that the sound of Tsurumi Island being destroyed could be heard all the way from Seirai.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Was the Thunderbird really that powerful?
:{{DIcon}} Considering that it could reduce Seirai Island to such a state...
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid it is that powerful, Paimon.
:'''Kama:''' My father did take me to Tsurumi once, to "see where it all began."
:'''Kama:''' Apparitions of the past would appear amidst the Sea of Fog, illusions replaying past events &mdash; namely, the final ceremony held on the island, albeit one in which the flow of time is all wrong.
:'''Kama:''' The Thunderbird then destroyed Tsurumi Island, resulting in a great storm... and then it started all over again.
:'''Paimon:''' So that's the reason why those people didn't take any notice of us at all? Because they were all illusions of the past?
:{{DIcon}} How bizarre.
:{{DIcon}} That's frightening.
:{{DIcon}} Rather convenient, I'd say.
:'''Kama:''' There's no meaning in speaking to the islanders. They are simply shadows created by the ley line disorders.
:'''Kama:''' However, there is one exception, which is the child who was the offering to the Thunderbird. I believe this to be the "Ruu" you spoke of.
:'''Paimon:''' But... But... That means we've got to save him!
:'''Kama:''' I wouldn't worry about this. They are all ultimately illusions created by the ley lines.
:{{DIcon}} No wonder the Maushiro disappears...
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, so the whole "Ghost Maushiro" thing Miss Sumida talked about was true!
::'''Paimon:''' ...But never mind all that! Paimon thinks we should at least try to help Ruu!
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to help him, too.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to explore the island further, too.
:'''Paimon:''' Even if he is an illusion, he's still Paimon's friend.
:'''Kama:''' Mm. Well, it doesn't matter to me either way. I have no love for Tsurumi, nor do I have any for my father's talk of bloodlines and history.
:'''Kama:''' ...
:'''Kama:''' Hmm, if I were Lady Sumida, I would say something like: "If the cycle of the Sea of Fog can be broken, then that 'history' may also be ended."
:{{DIcon}} "It would make a good story!"
:{{DIcon}} "It'll sell well for sure!"
:'''Kama:''' Haha, very funny.
:'''Paimon:''' But you didn't laugh...
:'''Kama:''' Really? I did, in fact, find it quite interesting.
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Well, sure... Either way, thanks for telling us all this stuff, Kama!
:'''Kama:''' Lady Sumida commissioned you.
:'''Kama:''' I have said enough, I believe.

:'''Paimon:''' We've asked Kama all we need to do. Now it's time to go looking for Ruu!

;(Talk to Kama again)
:'''Kama:''' All that talking has tired me out.
:'''Kama:''' Best of luck to you.
----
{{Quest Description|update|You receive some disturbing information from Kama... This is something that usually only happens in the novels you've read. However, what he describes lines up with the strange things that you have seen happen on Tsurumi Island. In which case, the most important thing to do right now is to go and help Ruu.}}

;(Approach the gate)
:'''Paimon:''' Just like last time, we should be able to find him as long as we go through this gate...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's hope we're in time...

;(Approach the marked spot)
:'''Paimon:''' Ruu's not here...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe he's deeper inside.
:'''Paimon:''' We need to find him, and quick! If not, the islanders are gonna sacrifice him to the Thunderbird!
:{{DIcon}} According to what Kama said...
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon knows that all the things happening here are illusions that constantly repeat themselves.
:'''Paimon:''' But if that's the case... doesn't that mean that Ruu's been sacrificed to the Thunderbird Archon-only-knows how many times?
:'''Paimon:''' That's... That's just too sad! We've got to help him, no matter what!
:{{DIcon}} You're right. Let's do this.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah!

;(Approach the perch)
:'''Paimon:''' Over there! We've seen those people before. What were their names again...
:'''Paimon:''' No, wait, it was an illusion, wasn't it?

;(Talk to Makiri or Ipe)
:'''Makiri:''' Isn't Ruu lucky~
:'''Ipe:''' ...
:'''Ipe:''' Don't be silly.
:'''Makiri:''' Oh. Sorry.
:'''Ipe:''' And the fact that I'm the only one doing work over here makes it worse!
:'''Paimon:''' That's Ipe and Makiri. Looks like they're making offerings to the Perch.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh... Paimon has an idea.
:{{DIcon}} What a coincidence. So do I.
:{{DIcon}} What's your thought, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' They said that the Perches are key to the ceremony, and so people need to make offerings there and protect them.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, the ceremony won't be able to continue if we destroy the Perches, right?
:{{DIcon}} But they're illusions of the past...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, even if that's so, don't you think it's worth a shot?
:'''Paimon:''' Since these islanders love their Thunderbird and perches and stuff so much, let's just give wrecking 'em a go!
:'''Paimon:''' They said that these perches contain the Thunderbird's power, right? Maybe they'll react if we blow them away...
----
{{Quest Description|update|The conversations you've {{sic|overhead}} from the Tsurumi Island natives &mdash; well, illusions of them, to be precise &mdash; must be the key to breaking through. Since you wish to disrupt their ceremony, then you have to destroy the all-important perches, which are needed for that ceremony.}}

;(When the perch reaches half health)
:'''Paimon:''' Some tingly stuff just flew by... Reminds Paimon of when we were looking for feathers on the Perch earlier!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we'll nowhere just standing around. Let's get lookin'!

;(After destroying the perch)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh! It works! It really works!
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, let's go get the rest!
----
{{Quest Description|update|From the reactions of the illusions of the past you see on the island, destroying the Perch seems to have had some effect. Well, then. One down, three to go.}}

;(After dissipating the orbs on the Northeast perch)
:'''Paimon:''' Woohoo, that's our (Traveler), alright! Let's go back and keep tearing that perch down!

;(After dissipating the orbs on the North perch)
:'''Paimon:''' These things really are troublesome. Well, guess we can go back and start destroying that perch again!

;(After dissipating the orbs on the West perch)
:'''Paimon:''' Guess we can just head back and start hitting that perch already, right?

;(After destroying all three perches)
:'''Paimon:''' That should be all of those perches.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's hope that's enough to stop the ceremony.
:{{DIcon}} Well, let's just hope so, eh?
:{{DIcon}} It's all in the past now, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon knows that! But...
:'''Paimon:''' We've got no clue where Ruu is...
:{{DIcon}} Well, if we want to be sure that we've disrupted the ceremony...
:{{DIcon}} We should go to the ceremonial site.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, that's right! Ruu always wanted us to take part in that ceremony...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's hope it doesn't end the same way this time.
----
{{Quest Description|update|Now that all the Perches on Tsurumi Island have been destroyed, the ceremony can no longer be held. Next up, time to check on the results of your hard work.}}

;(Approach the ceremonial site)
:'''You flee from the storm together with Paimon...'''

:'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That was close!
:'''Paimon:''' We barely managed to get out...
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;So this is the storm that Kama talked about...
:{{DIcon}} It could've been a result of us destroying the Perches.
:'''Paimon:''' That's true. They did have power in them after all...
:'''Paimon:''' Uh-oh! If it's storming out there, Ruu might be in danger...
:{{DIcon}} I doubt it.
::'''Paimon:''' Maybe, but... Paimon's still worried.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure we'll be able to find him.
::'''Paimon:''' It'll be hard, yeah, but we should go check on him anyway.
:{{DIcon}} We should go look for him.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, let's double back and see if we can find him, then.
----
{{Quest Description|update|You witness a scene akin to doomsday occurring at the ceremonial site. This must be the terrifying sight that Ruu has seen many, many times. Left with no choice, you and Paimon flee the scene together.}}

;(Approach Ruu)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! There's Ruu!

:'''Paimon:''' Ruu! You're alright...
:'''Ruu:''' (Traveler), Paimon...
:'''Ruu:''' Why... Why did you do this?
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Ruu:''' I thought that the two of you were good, strong people...
:'''Ruu:''' And that you'd be different from the others! You came back to look for me, listened to everything I said... I thought that the ceremony would go well this time... But...
:'''Paimon:''' We want to stop the ceremony! That way, you'll be safe!
:{{DIcon}} We're just trying to help.
::'''Ruu:''' But you're not helping!
:{{DIcon}} Why do you want the ceremony to proceed?
:'''Ruu:''' Back then... Something happened. Something went wrong. Things were going so well...
:'''Ruu:''' But then I woke up. I found that the island had become like this. Everyone was weird. No one could see me. No one could hear me!
:'''Ruu:''' Then after a while, a storm would start, and it would be super scary. At these times, only [[Wakukau Shoal|Wakukau]], [[Oina Beach|Oina]], and [[Autake Plains|Autake]] wouldn't be struck by lightning. I'd hide there and wait for the storm to end.
:'''Ruu:''' But once the thunder stopped, everything would repeat all over again. I would wake up &mdash; and everyone would be doing the same things.
:'''Ruu:''' Kapatcir's missing, too. I couldn't find her, not even on [[Mt. Kanna]].
:'''Ruu:''' The ceremony must have gone wrong. We must've made her angry.
:'''Ruu:''' That's why I prepared another ceremony, and another, and another. But it always ends the same. That's why I had the idea of bringing in people from the outside.
:'''Ruu:''' I thought that... you were my friends, and that you'd help me...
:'''Paimon:''' Actually, hold on a moment. Who is Kapatcir, anyway?
:{{DIcon}} That's what I've been thinking, too.
::'''Ruu:''' Other people call her the Thunderbird. She's our guardian deity.
:{{DIcon}} She's the Thunderbird, isn't she?
::'''Ruu:''' That's right, that's what they call her. She's our guardian deity.
:'''Ruu:''' If the ceremony goes smoothly, Kapatcir will be pleased. That way, everyone will be happy.
:'''Ruu:''' In the past, Kapatcir paid no attention to the people who were offered to her. But I'm different...
:'''Ruu:''' That's why I have to make sure that the ceremony goes well. That way, everyone can go back to normal and live their lives again.
:'''Ruu:''' Big Brother Ipe and Big Sister Makiri will get married, and Kina and Kito will grow up and become great adventurers!
:'''Ruu:''' And once things are better here, Big Sister Sayo will come back! Big Brother Kama, too! And Dad will no longer have to be afraid of Kapatcir's wrathful lightning!
:'''Ruu:''' And everyone would realize that the outside world isn't a bad place, because there are good people like you in it...
:'''Ruu:''' ...So why? Why did you ruin the ceremony?
:'''Paimon:''' Because this isn't right!
:'''Ruu:''' That's not true! This is right! Don't... Don't come back here again!
:'''Ruu:''' There's going to be another storm. I&mdash;It's going to be super scary!
:'''Ruu:''' Just go already! I don't want to see you ever again! *sobs*
;(Ruu runs away)
:'''Paimon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} No use staying here.
:{{DIcon}} Let's go and report back to Miss Sumida.
:'''Paimon:''' Mm. You're... You're right.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go.
----
{{Quest Description|update|As per your commission, you need to head back to Inazuma City to report to Sumida.}}

;(Talk to Sumida)
:'''Sumida:''' Ah, it's you two...
:'''Sumida:''' Have there been any new developments?

:'''You recount what happened on Tsurumi Island to Sumida...'''

:'''Sumida:''' ...
:'''Sumida:''' Mm, I've got it. Now, let's break this down simply...
:'''Sumida:''' According to your plot, the flow of time in Tsurumi Island does not match that of the outside world. If it were me, I certainly would &mdash; as you have &mdash; ascribed this to a special ley line disorder.
:'''Sumida:''' I doubt that such a ley line disorder could occur naturally, so... Let's just say it fell from the skies? Maybe it was a fragment of [[Celestia]], or something...
:'''Sumida:''' Which then mixed together with the lightning storms created by the Thunderbird to create these phenomena&mdash;
:'''Sumida:''' &mdash;And I'd give this plot a 4 out of 10, maybe. It's usable, but it's hard to execute. There should be a more elegant way of writing this...
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean when you say "plot," anyway...
:'''Sumida:''' Oh, don't worry about it. It's nothing of particular note...
:'''Sumida:''' So if we want to push the story forward, we need a few more plot points in play &mdash; for example... "The Tsurumi tragedy was born from a misunderstanding."
:'''Sumida:''' That's what I'd write, anyway.
:'''Sumida:''' For example, the priests and Ruu might have taken the Thunderbird's favor upon Ruu as a sign that it wanted him as a sacrifice, but in truth, the Thunderbird might have just liked him in particular.
:'''Sumida:''' I suppose the resolution to such a plotline would simply be to find a way to convey Ruu's feelings to the Thunderbird.
:{{DIcon}} Would that really work...
:{{DIcon}} That seems a little shallow.
:{{DIcon}} Don't you think that's rather cliché?
:'''Paimon:''' ...
:'''Sumida:''' Well, I can't say for sure, but I don't think there's any problem with this progression, per se. I remember a very popular series that ran for at least a few dozen volumes with this plot as the basis for its story!
:'''Sumida:''' You just need to find some ways to continuously insert various happenings that pose obstacles to the misunderstanding's resolution and allow it to fester! Why, that book...
:{{DIcon}} Could we get back on topic?
:'''Sumida:''' Oh. Right. Sorry...
:'''Sumida:''' But according to the developments you've mentioned, since the Thunderbird was vanquished on Seirai Island, and Ruu himself is but a shade of the past, then you can only avert this catastrophe via some mystical means.
:'''Sumida:''' Hmmm, this... This really is quite hard to write. There are so many things that would be hard to explain. Unacceptable. "The Chronicles of the Sea of Fog (Working Title)" can't be that sort of story...
:'''Sumida:''' Do you have any other ideas, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} Mind if we say something about Kama for a moment?
:'''Sumida:''' Oh, you've seen him around, then?

:'''''You tell Sumida about Kama's experiences...'''''

:'''Sumida:''' ...Wait, what? Kama is a descendant of Tsurumi Island's natives?
:'''Sumida:''' L&mdash;Let's go look for him &mdash; right now!

:'''You head to Ritou with Sumida to ask Kama some questions...'''

:'''Kama:''' ...It is as (Traveler) says. I am a descendant of the Tsurumi Island natives.
:'''Sumida:''' Why didn't you tell me that earlier? All those times I got you to send those people there...
:'''Kama:''' You never asked, Lady Sumida.
:'''Sumida:''' *sigh* Well, that is just how you are, but...
:'''Kama:''' ...
:'''Kama:''' Nor will telling Tsurumi's story edify anyone.
:'''Kama:''' My father clung to that story till his dying day. From the time I was young, he would often take me there. It's a gloomy place, one filled with nothing but terrible memories.
:'''Kama:''' But had you asked me, Lady Sumida, I would have told you.
:{{DIcon}} You should have a bit more faith in him.
:{{DIcon}} Kama's a really reliable guy.
:'''Sumida:''' ...You're right. If I had been more willing to ask for his opinion and trusted him more, I wouldn't have had to do this in such a roundabout fashion.
:'''Sumida:''' I'm sorry, Kama.
:'''Kama:''' It's alright.
:'''Sumida:''' W&mdash;Well then, as a remnant of Tsurumi Island, what do you think of this? "The last scion of Tsurumi returns to his desolate homeland, only to be caught up in the twisted weft of time..."
:'''Sumida:''' Simply put, you hear the call of your ancestors and head into the mists of Tsurumi Island. Following the sound of the Maushiro, you traverse the fog, only to realize as you approach the site of that millennia-old ceremony...
:'''Sumida:''' ...That you've become the same ancestor who bore your name all those years ago! There, you experience the island's final day &mdash; until violet lightning and roaring thunder rend the skies!
:'''Sumida:''' Then you awake &mdash; only to have the same day begin again!
:'''Sumida:''' Well, what do you think? Is this plot "This Novel Is Amazing!" grand prize-worthy?
:{{DIcon}} Will this really work...?
:'''Kama:''' It's not that impressive.
:'''Sumida:''' Hmm, I get it, I get it. You probably greatly value Tsurumi's history, so it's no surprise that you might be offended by my fictional appropriations. So, how about this, then...
:'''Kama:''' I'm not talking about that. Tsurumi's history doesn't matter that much to me.
:'''Kama:''' I just feel that this plot doesn't grab me as much as the "[[Toki Alley Tales]]" or "Kino's Travels" that you read to me before. Nor does it quite flow as freely as "The Three Young Nobles."
:'''Sumida:''' Uh... Um, that was... blunt of you.
:'''Kama:''' Sorry.
:'''Sumida:''' N&mdash;No, don't apologize at moments like this. That just feels even more hurtful to me as a writer...
:'''Kama:''' Sorry, I shouldn't have apologized.
:'''Sumida:''' Aghhh! This is so annoying &mdash; but most annoying of all is the fact that I can't refute your critique.
:{{DIcon}} Don't give up, Miss Sumida...
:{{DIcon}} You just need to write something that Kama will find interesting.
:'''Sumida:''' Yes, I know. I will do that. Kama's heard a lot of stories, after all. If he finds them interesting, I'm sure my editor will, too!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's the same.
:{{DIcon}} Don't give up either, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Paimon... was just thinking.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's never giving up, mind you! Paimon's just thinking... Could we try the method that Miss Sumida just mentioned?
:'''Sumida:''' Eh? What did I say? I've already forgotten...
:{{DIcon}} We could give it a go...
:{{DIcon}} I wouldn't get my hopes up.
:'''Paimon:''' But you're the one who said not to give up, (Traveler)! Paimon won't, either!
:'''Paimon:''' And anyway, didn't we agree to go have a good meal at [[Kiminami Restaurant]] once we finish this commission?
:'''Sumida:''' I don't think I follow, exactly, but it's good to see that Paimon's so spirited.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, you're talking to the illustrious Paimon, after all!
:'''Sumida:''' Well then, about this commission of ours...
:{{DIcon}} We'll continue plumbing the depths of Tsurumi Island's mysteries.
:'''Sumida:''' Alright. In that case, I look forward to your next report.
:'''Sumida:''' How do you adventurers say it again? Ah, right. "Ad astra abyssosque," (Traveler)!
;(Quest completes)
----
;(Talk to Sumida and Kama again)
:'''Sumida:''' Indulge my curiosity for a moment... Since you're a descendant of Tsurumi Island's people and your family seems quite interested in handing down their history...
:'''Sumida:''' Would you know how to make Maushiro, by any chance, Kama?
:'''Sumida:''' It's totally okay if you don't, by the way! It was a long time ago and all...
:'''Kama:''' I do. My grandfather taught me how to make them &mdash; and how to use them, too.
:'''Sumida:''' What... Uh... Then why did I spend all that Mora to hire people...
:'''Sumida:''' *cough* So then, is there anything else you can tell me about the Maushiro?
:'''Kama:''' They make "bwoooom" sounds.
:'''Sumida:''' I&mdash;I think I already knew that. Is there anything else?
:'''Kama:''' They are made of wood, and have no special requirements in that regard. [[Yumemiru Wood]], [[Otogi Wood]], they will all do.
:'''Kama:''' Let me think, was there anything else... Ah. If you give a Maushiro you made personally to someone, that is considered a marriage proposal.
:'''Sumida:''' What!?
:'''Sumida:''' That's not bad, actually. I'll include that into the story!
