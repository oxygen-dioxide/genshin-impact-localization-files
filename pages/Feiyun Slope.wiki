'''Feiyun Slope''' {{Lang|zh=绯云坡|zh_rm=Fēiyún-pō}} is the northern part of [[Liyue Harbor]]'s lower areas. It is the entrance to the city when coming from the northern main road (to [[Mondstadt]]) and connects to the two other districts of the Harbor: [[Chihu Rock]] to the south and [[Yujing Terrace]] to the west.

==Trivia==
* The {{Lang|"Feiyun"|zh=绯云|zh_rm=Fēiyún|zh_tl=Scarlet Clouds}} in Feiyun Slope actually uses different characters than the {{Lang|"Feiyun"|zh=飞云|zh_rm=Fēiyún|zh_tl=Flying Clouds}} in [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]]. However, they are pronounced identically in Chinese. This may be intentional and one may be named after another.
