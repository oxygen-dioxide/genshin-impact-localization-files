|vo_01_01_tx         = I'm Sucrose, a researcher of [[alchemy]]. I heard you've been to a lot of places, so I was wondering if you... Ah, what am I saying! It's only our first time meeting, I shouldn't trouble you. But... if you're willing, I'd love to hear any stories you have about your adventures. I'd... really like that.

|vo_03_01_tx         = The windmills are spinning faster than usual today. Hey, do you think if an animal put a propeller on its back and started running... do you think the propeller would make it run faster? Or even, fly?

|vo_03_02_title      = When It Snows
|vo_03_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} When It Snows.ogg
|vo_03_02_tx         = Snow this big only falls a few times a year. If I miss it, I'll have to wait until next year to run my experiments, so please give me some space. Ah-Ahchooo! ...Yes, I know, I should wear more layers...

|vo_03_03_title      = When the Sun Is Out
|vo_03_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} When the Sun Is Out.ogg

|vo_04_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Good Morning.ogg
|vo_04_01_tx         = Good morning. Did you sleep well? According to research, not getting a good night's sleep can have detrimental effects on your cognition and stamina. What? I'm always up working through the night? Yeah, I know... Can't be helped I guess...

|vo_04_02_title      = Good Afternoon
|vo_04_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Good Afternoon.ogg
|vo_04_02_tx         = Waaaaa! No, stay back, don't come over here! No, no, it's nothing personal &mdash; it's just that this experiment is highly volatile and might cause an explosion.

|vo_04_03_title      = Good Evening
|vo_04_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Good Evening.ogg
|vo_04_03_tx         = Good evening. Please wait a moment. Experiment 905 has actually produced two light excretions, which, for clarity's sake, should be labeled No. 1033 and No. 1035 respectively... Right, now, what did you need me for?

|vo_04_04_title      = Good Night
|vo_04_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Good Night.ogg
|vo_04_04_tx         = No need to wait up for me. Please, get some sleep. Something bothering you? Oh, don't worry about me &mdash; I'm right at the end of my experiment. I promise I won't stay up late again...

|vo_05_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Bio-Alchemy.ogg
|vo_05_01_tx         = Bio-alchemy, when compared with creation, places more emphasis on transformation. Finding those little secrets that living creatures have and scaling them up, combining them &mdash; the results are always such a surprise. Life really is fascinating. Just how much do we really know?

|vo_05_02_title      = About {name}: Fear of Strangers
|vo_05_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Fear of Strangers.ogg
|vo_05_02_tx         = I... um... really don't know how to act around new people. Everyone's personality is different, as are the things they care about. If I slip up and say the wrong thing, I'll offend someone, or sound impolite... Talking is hard, so much harder than alchemy.

|vo_05_03_title      = About {name}: Ears
|vo_05_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Ears.ogg
|vo_05_03_tx         = Oh, you, ahh... noticed. My ears are a hereditary feature... quite different from everyone else's. So, I try to hide them with my hair as much as possible.

<!-- About Us -->
|vo_06_01_title      = About Us: Observing
|vo_06_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Observing.ogg
|vo_06_01_tx         = I'm curious to know about your background. I was wondering... could I perhaps... observe you for a while? I'll be silent, and I won't interfere with what you're doing. Would... that be okay?

|vo_06_02_title      = About Us: Perks
|vo_06_02_friendship = 6
|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Perks.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = To be honest, I was a little afraid when we first met, because you don't talk much... I thought I must have offended you somehow. But then as time went on, I discovered you're really easy to get along with. Hehe, just an unexpected outcome of my observations.

|vo_06_03_title      = About Us: Requests
|vo_06_03_friendship = 6
|vo_06_03_quest      = The Outlander Who Caught the Wind
|vo_06_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Requests.ogg
|vo_06_03_tx         = I heard it was you that dealt with the [[Stormterror]] issue. No doubt it was a dangerous fight &mdash; it's a good thing you came out unscathed. I was ahh... also wondering &mdash; did Stormterror happen to drop anything during the fight? You know, a scale, some skin &mdash; even just a little would be fine. There are some tests I'd like to run...
|vo_06_03_mention    = Dvalin

<!-- Miscellaneous I -->

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = My Vision is my most important research tool. Hmm? Why, without it I'd be unable to proceed with most of my elemental research. Combat? Oh, I suppose I use it for that too when I'm out in the field looking for materials.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = This room is where I keep all the bones I've collected. On the table on the left we have lizards, frogs, and grass carp. To the front we have the bones of a wild boar, and then over there in the right corner is a [[hilichurl]]... Oh, don't be nervous, nothing to be afraid of. They're really quite cute once you get used to them.

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = If you look closely, you'll notice that the [[Mist Flower]]s I've planted here are all different. This one is the most powerful, this one blooms the longest... Hmm? This one? Oh, this one is project 3, version 17, enlargement trial. Its defining trait is that... it's a bit larger.

<!-- About Others -->
|vo_08_01_title      = About [[Noelle]]
|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Noelle.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = She's... a very willing helper, I can't deny that. It's just... she makes me a little anxious is all. One time, she saw three boxes of materials stacked just outside my laboratory door, and proceeded to move them inside for me. A nice gesture, but the thing is... I'd only just finished putting them outside...
|vo_08_01_mention    = Noelle

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Klee]]
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Klee.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = [[Jean]] has put her into solitary confinement so many times, but every time she's let out it's not long before she's back in trouble. *sigh* Something tells me she hasn't done much introspection. I told her I'd make her a bouncing, dancing Jumpy Dumpty that is also safe &mdash; but to date there are still a lot of problems with the design.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Jean,Klee

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Jean]]
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Jean.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = I don't dare talk to Master Jean that much, because she's so strict. I know she's a good person and all &mdash; I know that, I do &mdash; but... I still find her scary. I don't tend to bother her, and even when I have to... I ask [[Albedo]] to go on my behalf.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Jean,Albedo

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Lisa]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Lisa.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = She really seems to know a great deal. She's obviously never seen my research, and yet on so many occasions she's given me advice on that which is most core to my studies. Just how does she know? Is it observation, or is it ratiocination?
|vo_08_04_mention    = Lisa

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Kaeya]]
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kaeya.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = Oh... I know he likes to joke, and isn't trying to make fun of me, but I often struggle to work out which parts of what he says are the truth and which parts are jokes. So whenever he talks to me, the outcome is usually one of two things: morbid embarrassment or unbearable awkwardness.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Kaeya

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Albedo]]: Artistry
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Albedo - Artistry.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = As his assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking. No matter how complex the task at hand, his way of thinking ensures he gets to the bottom of it, and is able to explain it thoroughly. His methodologies are amazing... to me, it's where alchemy meets art.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Albedo

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Albedo]]: Talent
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Albedo - Talent.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = Talent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research &mdash; I'd still spend my whole life playing catch up. But, my studying bio-alchemy has nothing to do with evading his line of research, we just happen to have different interests and dreams &mdash; nothing more.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Albedo

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Amber]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Amber.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = I'm curious as to why her doll is called "[[Baron Bunny]]," it clearly has nothing to do with a rabbit at all. Oh, the headband makes it look like it has rabbit ears you say? Hmm... That's heavily reliant on the rabbit stereotype, is it not? Many rabbits' ears are floppy.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Amber

|vo_08_09_title      = About [[Fischl]]
|vo_08_09_friendship = 4
|vo_08_09_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Fischl.ogg
|vo_08_09_tx         = I take it you're referring to the book series, [[Flowers for Princess Fischl]]? Indeed, the [[Immernachtreich|world]] the author came up with is very creative. If only I could go see it with my own eyes. Oh, you're referring to Fischl herself? I am... doubtful that she could really take me there.
|vo_08_09_mention    = Fischl

|vo_08_10_title      = About [[Eula]]
|vo_08_10_friendship = 4
|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Eula.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = The role of a scout is a hazardous one, and Ms. Eula throws herself into danger all too easily. So, I made a reconnaissance device for her, so that she wouldn't have to infiltrate enemy camps herself. But Ms. Eula has such an imposing manner, she really puts me on edge, and... I was so nervous that I accidentally left out a few important details while explaining how to use it... As a result, there was an accident...<br>Ah, what should I do... I hope she won't hold a grudge against me...
|vo_08_10_mention    = Eula

I'm already quite used to working alone. ...You're truly not busy? I&mdash;In that case, I don't suppose you could help me with a few things? Or, you know, we could sit and chat about... stuff.

|vo_10_04_tx         = Once I came to understand more about bio-alchemy, I stopped eating [[mushroom]]s. You're no doubt aware? Mushrooms grow on that which has died, which in turn makes me think of other such things, and my appetite just disappears... Blergh...
