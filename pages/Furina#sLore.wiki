==Personality==
{{Quote|The absolute focus of the stage of judgment, until the final applause sounds.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Flamboyant and imprudent, Furina lives for the thrill of the courtroom, often speaking in a manner peppered with bravado and drama. She is impatient and has a childlike temper, and she will occasionally make judgments that she doesn't mean, which [[Neuvillette]] frequently has to control while conducting a trial to avoid complications. While she enjoys being in the spotlight, she only does so when it is focused at her positively, breaking down in complete shambles should something go out of plan and will try to save face at the first possible opportunity. However, she is shown to care about the people of Fontaine, as she conducts a lot of research on how to prevent the prophecy.

It is later revealed that Furina was not the true Hydro Archon. Focalors, the successor of [[Egeria]], had separated her divinity from her body and spirit; Furina was the Archon's body and spirit but had no powers. Focalors used Furina as a way to deceive the [[Heavenly Principles]] in order to prevent the result of the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophecy]] regarding [[Fontaine]] from becoming a permanent reality. Furina was tasked with maintaining the guise of an Archon and cursed by Focalors so that she could not die nor pursue her own happiness so long as Focalors lived. As a new "human," she had difficulty taking the role but eventually mastered it. Aware of the prophecy that would doom Fontaine, Furina assumed the role of Hydro Archon for 500 years; while she was successful in this task, it wore her down mentally so that she suffered from severe self-esteem issues and paranoia, as shown when the [[Traveler]] convinced the court audience that she was a fraud in her trial. Despite being undying due to being cursed by Focalors, Furina remained fearful of situations that seemed deadly, as she pleaded [[Arlecchino|the Knave]] to not kill her during an attack for the Hydro [[Gnosis]], and was hesitant in dipping her hand into [[Primordial Sea]]water to prove whether she is the Hydro Archon during a trial. As a result, she deeply fears rising water levels<ref>{{Ref/VO|Furina|When It Rains}}</ref> or the Knave being mentioned to her.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Furina|About The Knave}}</ref>

Upon being freed of her role as an acting Archon, Furina had returned to her normal self, but without the burdens associated with her role. While she is still flamboyant and dramatic at times, she now displays a softer, humbler and insecure side of herself. At first, she struggled coming to terms with her role being over, believing that her newfound freedom meant that she was no longer needed, and had trouble reaching out for the people closest to her while she was the Archon, such as Neuvillette and [[Clorinde]]. She also planned to retire from the stage despite her love of acting, finding it difficult due to the mental ordeal of having maintained the persona of an Archon for centuries. After being comforted by the Traveler, Neuvillette, and [[Navia]] as well as getting invited to a party by Clorinde, she realizes that her journey of self-discovery means that she no longer has to live her life in solitude. Eventually, she is able to regain the courage to move forward and go back onstage for the first time since her abdication, and learns to accept her identity not as the Hydro Archon, but simply as herself, culminating in her receiving a {{Hydro}} Vision.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|"The Little Oceanid"}}</ref>

Both as her time as archon and human, she is shown to greatly enjoy fancy confections and desserts, such as cake.

==Appearance==
{{See also|Coronated Prima Donna}}
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Furina is a fair-skinned woman who uses the [[:Category:Medium Female Characters|medium female]] model. Her eyes are {{w|Heterochromia iridum|heterochromatic}} and have droplet-shaped pupils: her right eye is light blue with a dark blue pupil, while her left eye reverses the color scheme with a purple outer ring. She also has beaded-like eyelashes. She has soft white hair with light blue streaks. [[Arkhe]] alignments cause changes in Furina's features.

{{Pneuma}}: Furina's hair is sectioned into two parts, similar to a jellyfish cut: a short wavy bob cut of white, and a layer underneath of twin strands. Both sport "glowing" blue streaks. Her outfit is centered around pale blues and white.

{{Ousia}}: Furina's hair is shortened to only the bob section. A single lock of hair, like a long ahoge, points towards the right of her hat. Her outfit is centered around dark blues and black.

{{Quote|One lie always follows another, and so "justice" awaits inescapably at the end. The ignorant see this as some kind of farce. But if they trace back to the source, they inevitably realize that they began by deceiving themselves.|A disordered fable left in someone's dream by [[Mage "N"]]}}
Undoubtedly, Furina has been much loved by the people of Fontaine from the moment she became the [[Hydro Archon]].

Her charismatic parlance, lively wit, and elegant bearing &mdash; all bear witness to her godly charms.

But perhaps the thing that she is most revered for is her unrivaled sense of drama.

As the protagonist of a famous play at the [[Opera Epiclese]] once put it,

"Life is like the theater &mdash; you never can tell when the twist will come."

Furina is as inscrutable as the most cunning of stage characters, her course of action defying all prediction.

In fact it's precisely for this reason that the god of Justice and Judgment, unapproachable in her divine majesty, has such a bewitching influence.

But when the curtain falls, a hollow feeling invariably starts to creep in.

There are those who wonder whether there are moments in the dead of night when even a god like Furina feels the sharp pangs of loneliness.

No, surely not. People couldn't possibly imagine, let alone believe, that such a scene might play out.

And that's indeed the way it should be.

That is, were it not for the fact that Furina's tears had already been silently washed away by the [[Fountain of Lucine]].

As the voices of doubt have bubbled up like a torrent, she has been forced to adopt a higher-spirited and more unyielding demeanor in her defense.

But she must also continue to fulfill her duties at hand, and can't possibly let her weakness be exposed through the rise and fall of her emotions.

The advent of an impending disaster &mdash; long foretold by ancient prophecy &mdash; draws near. Faced with such times, what is a god to do? More than anyone else, she wishes she knew.

From an onlooker's perspective, she seems distracted and weary &mdash; but she waves this off as a simple lack of sleep. As the Regina, loved and respected by her people, how could she let such buzzing naysayers get to her?

No &mdash; no matter how chaotic and urgent things get, she can't allow herself to drop the ball now, nor can she let all those years of hard work come to nothing.

Beloved by all, the one and only star of this grand opera...

Whether lonely, helpless, in pain, or in sorrow, and even if it means taking all the misery of this world onto her shoulders...

Her will to protect the people of Fontaine &mdash; every last one of them &mdash; has never yet faltered.

              --><p>Visions are usually objects that appear in response to humankind's most fervent wishes, but this one, in particular, seemed more like a reward for her past deeds.</p><!--
              --><p>As Furina grasped it, its reflected radiance seemed to contain her heart, filled once again by this performance.</p><!--
              --><p>Performing had, in the past, brought her much pain, to the point where she had turned her back on the stage, but she indubitably understood the glory and brilliance of the stage best of all, and could give those who chase their dreams on the stage her matchless guidance and support.</p><!--
              --><p>As to the question of what to do next, which had plagued her for so long, she now had a clear answer:</p><!--
              --><p>To see this world from the perspective of the audience, and create the greatest performances without stepping onstage.</p><!--
              --><p>No longer would her attention be focused only on musicals &mdash; as long as it's related to performance, Furina is interested in taking part from behind the curtain.</p><!--
              --><p>Also, it is worth mentioning that though she seemed quite calm upon receiving that Vision, so much so that she even managed a few fine words, upon leaving the theater troupe, Furina immediately set off afterward to avenge herself on the "[[Local Legend]]" she had once angered by accident... which ended quite poorly for her.</p><!--
              --><p>She returned home, dejected but not defeated. She spent all night studying her Vision, which ended up causing the entire building to flood.</p><!--
              --><p>And once she had finally cleaned things up together with the Salon Members, she received a final missive from the apartment manager.</p><!--
              --><p>"No pets allowed in these apartments &mdash; not even if they are a Gentilhomme or Surintendante."</p>

==Trivia==
* Furina's singing voice in {{Quest|This Life, Just Like a Light Trickle of Song}} was provided by {{w|Cécilia Cara}} for all four voiced languages.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/kglEsR7bqAY Story Teaser: La vaguelette]</ref><ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/MQq04-y_eM4 《原神》剧情PV-「轻涟」]</ref><ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/UKObnCmGwWs Story Teaser: La vaguelette (Japanese)]</ref><ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/lNwnIhY1mA4 원신 | 스토리 PV-「잔물결」]</ref>
* Furina wields the [[Splendor of Tranquil Waters]] in her portrait art and the [https://youtu.be/1Ip43DfbkUw Version 4.2 Trailer].
* Furina is the first character since [[Version 1.3]] to receive a [[Character Introduction]] illustration whose base artwork is significantly different from that of her Wish Artwork.<!-- with the Live2D animations, it's a trivial matter to just resize and skew the not-totally-redrawn parts as needed, with the biggest indicators that her base art was still used as a base being her legs and shoes; we still have not returned to the time of totally different artworks, nor is Furina the first to have differences in their base art at all--she is preceded by Rosaria, Cyno, Wanderer, Baizhu, Lyney, and Wriothesley there -->
* Furina is the first character to exhibit a number of mechanics enabled by her atypical [[Charged Attack]], which are as follows:
** She can switch between the two [[Arkhe]] alignments.
** She can change her outfit as seen in menus without using the [[Dressing Room]].
** Her Charged Attack is not preceded by a [[Normal Attack]], a trait that is otherwise not found among most characters who use [[sword]]s, [[polearm]]s, or stances that share the features of sword and polearm attacks.
* Furina is one of only two characters who can cause the surface of any unfrozen body of [[water]] to be treated as if it were land for all of her own normal character actions, such as executing [[Plunging Attack]]s and taking [[Fall DMG|fall damage]]. She does this through her [[Elemental Skill]], [[Salon Solitaire]]. This mechanic was first introduced with [[Sangonomiya Kokomi's Elemental Burst]].
** Furina is the first to be able to treat unfrozen water as land for an infinite uninterrupted amount of time.
* When Furina leaps out of water, the trail of water behind her sparkles.
* Furina is one of the few characters that players witness receiving a [[Vision]], the first one being [[Rana]], or the [[Wanderer]] when considering only playable characters.
** Her Vision has a unique design, which contains elements of both the {{Pneuma}} and {{Ousia}} vision cases. The Vision case also features four claw-like prongs that hold the Vision's gem in place. However, the UI icon of her Vision in character menus will appear as a normal Pneuma or Ousia Vision depending on her current alignment.
* Furina is one of the few currently playable characters who acknowledges or even seems aware that the Traveler is from another world.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Apocalypse}}</ref>
* Furina's [[Constellation]] has her self-portrait, similar to the Traveler, the Wanderer, and the playable Archons.
* Before completing {{Quest|"The Little Oceanid"}}, her Profile section lists the source of her Hydro powers as "???". After completing it, the power source is revealed to be "Vision."
* Furina is likely ambidextrous, due to her wielding her sword with both hands depending on the circumstances: 
** She wields her sword with her left hand when performing her [[Soloist's Solicitation|Normal Attack]] and the Ousia variant of her [[Salon Solitaire|Elemental Skill]].
** She wields her sword with her right hand when performing her Charged Attack and Plunging Attack.
* Furina shares her Korean voice actress, Kim Ha-yeong, with [[Sucrose]].
* Furina's birthday, October 13th, is a public holiday in Fontaine and remains as such even after her abdication from the position of Hydro Archon.<ref name="Merusea Village...">{{Ref/Mail|Mail/Merusea Village... (2023-12-18)}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* Furina may be named after two gods from ancient Roman mythology: Furrina and Fontus.
** {{W|Furrina}}, also spelled Furina, is the Roman goddess of springs.
*** Her predecessor, [[Egeria]], is also named after a {{W|Egeria_(mythology)|Roman goddess}}.
** {{W|Fontus}}, also spelled Fons, is the Roman god of wells and springs.
*** A religious festival called Fontinalia is held in his honor on October 13th, which is also the date of Furina's birthday.
*** '''Fons''' means "source" or "root" in Latin. It is also the origin of the word "spring" in many European languages, such as Fontana in Italian, Fountain in English and '''Fontaine''' in French.
* Furina's Chinese name, {{Zh|tx=芙宁娜|rm=Fúníngnà}} is probably derived from {{zh|宁芙|Níngfú|tl=Nymph}}, the water sprite in Greek mythology. And the term {{zh|水仙|tl=narcissus}} is translated as "Nymph" in English in game. 
* Furina's surname, de Fontaine, features the French {{w|nobiliary particle}} {{Fr|de}} to denote her noble origins.
