===The Price of Tea===
:'''Message:''' "Speaking of which, the tea trade has been booming, yet there are fewer tea clippers coming from [[Liyue]]. Is someone deliberately driving up prices?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I returned from Yilong Wharf last month, where I found bulk tea to be significantly more expensive than previously. I can't imagine there is much profit in the trade recently. Perhaps spices would be better..."
:'''Ms. Cassigneul's Reply:''' "Tea prices continue to fluctuate within a reasonable range. Please refer to official sources for market updates and do not believe, act on, or spread unconfirmed rumors."
