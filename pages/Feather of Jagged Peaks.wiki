{{Description|A hard feather from a large seacliff hawk. The basalt tip of the feather sometimes glistens with a cool dew.}}
'''Feather of Jagged Peaks''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Archaic Petra]].

==Description==
A feather left behind by the giant wings that flattened the mountains.<br>Though its tip has long turned a deep black, this feather remains sharp as a naked blade.

They say that in [[Archon War|ancient times]], when the world was in turmoil, Rex Lapis uprooted mountains to create a giant bird of prey.<br>The [[Primordial Jade Winged-Spear|bird was carved out of rock and jade]], and it soared above the ground the moment it had taken shape.<br>Spiraling toward the heavens, it pierced through the clouds and flattened many stone peaks therein.

They say that the rock kite spread its wings and dived towards the ocean,<br>Plummeting from the sky like a sharpened spear,<br>Right into the heart of the sea, and the monsters within...

And they say that the [[Guyun Stone Forest|pillars of stone]] that jut out from the ocean continue to attract birds to this day.
