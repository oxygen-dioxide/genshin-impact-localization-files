{{Description|A hard feather from a large seacliff hawk. The basalt tip of the feather sometimes glistens with a cool dew.}}
'''Feather of Jagged Peaks''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Archaic Petra]].

==Description==
A feather left behind by the giant wings that flattened the mountains.<br />Though it has long turned moss-green, this feather remains as sharp as a naked blade.

They say that in ancient times, when the world was in turmoil, Rex Lapis plucked mountains and turned them into huge birds of prey.<br />These birds were carved out of rock and jade, and they soared above the ground once they had taken shape.<br />Spiraling towards the heavens, they pierced through the clouds and flattened many stone peaks therein.

They say that these rock kites spread their wings and dived towards the ocean,<br />And they fell from the sky like comets,<br />Right into the heart of the sea, and the monsters within...

And they say that the pillars of stone that jut out from the ocean continue to attract birds to this day.
