There's no rhyme or reason for it, really. I just like to see what every seed grows up to be, so I end up with a lot of produce. As long as my vegetables wind up in the stomach of someone who enjoys them, that's all that matters.

|vo_04_03_tx         = I could really go for some sparkling coffee flavored with [[Saurian Claw Succulent]]. I take mine black... Huh? You should only drink coffee in the morning? Well then... Good morning.

|vo_04_04_tx         = My brain is always wide awake this time of night, so go ahead and rest. I used to try and force myself to fall asleep, but I gave up a long time ago. I think I'll just go check on the radishes instead.

|vo_06_01_tx         = I'm sorry... No, I'm more than sorry. I know lying to you right out of the gate didn't make the best first impression. I have explained to you the reasons why, and I promise I spoke only the truth. Still, it's okay if you don't accept my apology. If that's the case, I'll try to stay out of your way.

|vo_06_02_tx         = Here, this is a Saurian claw succulent picked at four in the morning, a [[Quenepa Berry]] bigger than my head, the sweetest batch of honey from last week, and... Oh! And a voucher for a free appointment with [[Cacucu]].<br>Huh? Why do you look confused? It's a thank you for all your help. I wasn't sure if you needed anything, so I just went with gifts that I like.<br>Oh, who's Cacucu? A [[saurian]]. I'll introduce you sometime.
|vo_06_02_mention    = Cacucu

<!-- Miscellany I -->

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = Some people say lightning helps crops grow. So, I tried using my Vision in the middle of my vegetable field once, but the cabbages and tomatoes didn't like it, so I gave up.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = Here's a tip &mdash; don't be the first person to put yourself out there. The first fruit that ripens is the easiest target, and people work the same way. Those who take the initiative usually wind up with the short end of the stick.

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = [[Flying Squirrel|Flying squirrels]] may seem like proud and aloof creatures when they glide through the air, but they're much more cunning than they look, always zooming in from nowhere, clinging to you until they get a treat... Little rascals, honestly.

<!-- About Others -->

|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Xilonen.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = She seems to enjoy relaxing in high places, especially trees. In my experience, hanging upside down from a tree branch is more relaxing than lying on top of one. Maybe I should share that with her sometime... What? But don't we all need a change of perspective every now and then? Shouldn't that be even more true for an inventor like Xilonen?
|vo_08_01_mention    = Xilonen

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Kinich]]
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kinich.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = [[Ajaw]] is an interesting case. He's old, but also young... And Kinich is just the opposite &mdash; young, but also old. You know what I mean, right?
|vo_08_02_mention    = Kinich,Ajaw

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Chasca]]
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Chasca.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = Chasca is famous for a reason. She's an amazing mediator. The minute she shows up, all the fighting stops, and everyone starts shaking hands like the best of friends. She has a pretty convincing method, apparently &mdash; "armed deterrence"... Not a bad name.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Chasca

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Ifa]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Ifa.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Ifa may scold his patients a lot, but he actually has a great relationship with the saurians. Whenever he has some time off, he'd play the guitar in front of the clinic, and a bunch of saurians would gather around and sing along.<br>Although, it's more like noise than actual singing. I like to join in when I'm around, too... with the saurians, I mean.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Ifa

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Citlali]]

|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Citlali.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = Granny is actually a very straightforward person. She wears her emotions on her sleeve, you know? It's hard for her to hide what she's feeling. You're the same age as her, right? Or... are you even older?<br>Sorry, I shouldn't ask. That was probably rude... But, if I'm right, maybe you could spend more time together. Granny's been surrounded by people younger than her for a long time, and she's probably had enough. I know she'll be happy to see you.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Citlali

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Iansan]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Iansan.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = Iansan is a famous sports coach, and well... All I can say is, I'm grateful the Pyro Archon didn't send her after me. I may have an advantage when it comes to height, but I'm pretty sure she can outrun me... Oh, the smoke-cloud trick? Heh, after you use it a bunch, people start to see it coming.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Iansan,Mavuika

|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Mavuika.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = I didn't really know the Pyro Archon before all this.<br>I mean, I knew of her, but I didn't KNOW know her, you know? I used to think of her like a totem engraved with the word "strength," like a symbol of total power and control. But, it never went deeper than that, so doubt started to creep in.<br>Now that I know her better, I feel grateful, but I'm also a little disappointed in myself... She seems so sure of her purpose. She has a fire inside her and knows exactly why it burns, so she won't ever let the flames go out. I want that... I want to be someone who can help Natlan.<br>Anyway, so there's that, and um... I also noticed her eating a lot of leafy vegetables at the victory feast. When I asked her about it, she said she likes to keep a balanced diet. Kinda surprised me somehow. I guess she's more mindful of the little things than I expected.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Mavuika

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[The Captain]]
|vo_08_08_quest      = Incandescent Ode of Resurrection
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About The Captain.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = Meeting The Captain was a strange and unexpected twist of fate for me. My tribe is known for our ability to predict the future, but I never expected things would turn out so complicated. Is helping someone really about trading favors until the score is even? If so, why do I still feel so indebted to him? So grateful for what he did for me? Or... maybe I'm overthinking everything. No matter what happened in the past, he helped save Natlan's Ley Lines. He's a hero worthy of respect, and I'll always remember him.

|vo_09_02_tx         = You always seem so busy. I want to be like that, too &mdash; the kind of person who always has something to do. Then again, sometimes I like doing nothing at all. I keep flipping back and forth. It's annoying, but I can't help it.

|vo_09_03_tx         = In Natlan, it gets really hot during the day, so I choose to go out at night if possible. The moonlight makes the surface of the water glisten. Have you noticed? Although, at night, the water turns pitch-black. It's impossible to tell how clean it is, so I would avoid contact.

|vo_09_04_tx         = I'm more sensitive to souls than most people. I was born that way, but it's also kind of hard to describe... Human souls are like unpredictable masses of energy. Imagine a bunch of little saurian marshmallows of all different kinds... That's basically what a soul looks like. Your soul is warm, like it's been lightly toasted above a glowing fire.

|vo_09_05_tx         = Other people don't understand me, and to be honest, I don't fully understand myself, either. I have so many doubts, so many unanswered questions, and new ones keep on coming.<br>But, there's no quick-fix for something like this... Just gotta keep moving forward, right?
