==Ley Line Disorder==
* When an opponent is defeated, all party members will be affected by {{Color|help|Corrosion}}. Characters being Corroded will lose a fraction of their HP every second. Active characters can be brought down by Corrosion. When a non-active character's HP is less than 15%, they will no longer lose HP due to Corrosion. Corrosion lasts for 8s and can stack. The duration of each stack is independent of the others.
