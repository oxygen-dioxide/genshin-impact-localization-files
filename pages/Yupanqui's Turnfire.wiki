==Summary==
{{Description|Among the Scions of the Canopy, a crisis that concerns the tribe's honor — even its very future — is quietly brewing away...}}
===Act I - A Mysterious Visitor From Huitztlan===
{{Main|A Mysterious Visitor From Huitztlan}}
{{Description|In the process of helping Huni and Toba find the baby Saurians, you discover by chance that a secret plot seems to be underway, orchestrated by the powers of the Abyss...}}

At the base of [[Coatepec Mountain]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] run into [[Huni]] and [[Toba]], two children from the Scions of the Canopy. They ask if they were here to help them find their baby [[Yumkasaur Whelp|Yumkasaurs]], as someone named Sanka had told them that they were coming to help. Upon learning that they weren't, the children were upset that they were deceived, but the two still offer to help them.

Upon finding Pocchi, the Traveler and Paimon are surprised to see [[Ajaw]] with it, who tells them that about an [[Abyss]] incident; the Yumkasaurs' mother was infected with Abyssal energy, attacking her tribe and then her children before committing suicide by jumping off a cliff. Ajaw still senses the lingering taint of Abyssal energy in the area and to interrogate any suspicious outsiders they come across. Returning to the two children, they explain that they had met a man who promised to help them as long as they kept telling him stories about their tribe. When they told him that the latest bearer of the Turnfire name was [[Kinich]], he attempted to ask about him but spotted the Traveler and Paimon coming up and fled after distracting the children.

Paimon then suggests they inform Kinich, prompting the children to ask if they knew him. Upon confirming so, they are pleased to know and tell them that they can reach their village by following the path ahead.

===Act II - A Hero's Rite===
{{Main|A Hero's Rite}}
{{Description|After being told by Elder Trinidad of the crisis facing the Scions of the Canopy, you refuse to just stand idly by — such is the purity of your noble heart. But how will you solve this problem this time...?}}

Arriving at the [["Scions of the Canopy"|tribe village]], the Traveler and Paimon find Huni being scolded by her father [[Trinidad]] for sneaking out. Huni spots and introduces them to her father, though he is skeptical if they were kind people until Huni mentions that they had eaten with Kinich. Trinidad then realizes that the two visitors before him were the same ones who appeared at the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. Apologizing for his behavior, he proceeds to tell them of his current problem. He tells them a story about Turnfire Night, a ceremony that honors [[Burkina]] and his Saurian companion, [[Kongamato]], who fought the Abyss. Burkina ultimately died, while Kongamato was afflicted with Abyssal energy. While the energy allows Kongamato to live unnaturally longer compared to other Yumkasaurs, the energy is highly sensitive and thus the ceremony helps keep the energy at stable levels.

Unfortunately, five months since the last ceremony, Kongamato was showing signs of instability and in his rage, attacked Trinidad's companion, Nanna, infesting her with said energy and resulting in her death. The tribe had looked forward to Kinich to serve as the flame-bearer, but to their disdain, he had asked for a price, which they took as a no. Thus, Trinidad decides that the Traveler and Paimon could take his place; they accept, so he leads them to a staging site.

In another area, Kinich and Ajaw confront [[The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou"|Sanka]]. Sanka reveals that he was sick and tired of spying on the pair from afar and allowed Kinich to catch up to him as he didn't feel like running, offering to negotiate with him for better terms. Kinich senses his intentions and tells him to reveal his true motives, surprising Sanka, before he would offer his price.

At the top of Coatepec Mountain, the Traveler, Paimon and Trinidad arrive at the site to find that the Abyssal contamination was back. Trinidad informs the Traveler how to perform a part of the ceremony, which they complete in record time. Pleased with their performance, Trinidad decides to recommend them for the ceremony and tells them to drop by his home for some final details before they actually start. Unbeknownst to the three, Kinich is observing them from a concealed location.

===Act III - Kinich's Deal===
{{Main|Kinich's Deal}}
{{Description|Finally, you and Kinich manage to resolve the crisis facing the Mountain King and the tribe — albeit in a very different manner from how you had imagined. Thinking back to the night of the ritual, you could not even say for sure if the legendary fireball truly did descend for all to see. But thanks to an extraordinarily excited scholar of Ancient Names, the story of Malipo's glorious manifestation came to be recorded in its entirety. Thus shall the tale be passed on, until someday, when it shall surely become an enigmatic relic of what once was, only to be unearthed once more in the next era by those hungry for knowledge.}}
