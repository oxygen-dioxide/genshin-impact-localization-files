|text1    = A hypostasis that uses an inert shell to defend itself. It now displays abnormalities due to having been corrupted by some unknown influence. You must seize moments where its elemental core is exposed to attack effectively. When it is in danger, it will release Restorative Piths that have the properties of [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]]s. Use {{Color|help|Dendro}} to revive these Piths and induce a Normal State in them to continuously cleanse the Dendro Hypostasis, and use {{Color|help|Electro}} to trigger their Activated state and speed up the cleansing process. Using Dendro attacks on the Dendro Hypostasis' core can also help to cleanse the creature. {{Color|help|Complete the cleansing process}} to complete the challenge.
