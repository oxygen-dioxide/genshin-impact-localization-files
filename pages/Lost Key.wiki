{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Wyatt)
:'''Wyatt:''' Traveler! You couldn't have picked a better time.
:'''Wyatt:''' Last night, I was on my way to the city to deliver these goods, when suddenly, some shining orbs caught my eye.
:'''Wyatt:''' I&mdash;I'd had too much to drink, and... I just felt drawn to them, you know? I went to check it out and it turned out to be a huge group of slimes. They even bumped into me really hard!
:'''Wyatt:''' I panicked and ran, but lost my way. It took me forever to find my cart again. Then, this morning, I found out my {{Color|buzzword|key}} was gone...
:'''Wyatt:''' Could you help me look for it? It's got to be right around here somewhere... I feel like it's right under my nose.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
::'''Wyatt:''' Great! It's such a huge area, I just wouldn't know where to start looking.
:{{DIcon}} I have some pressing business to attend to.
::'''Wyatt:''' This is such a huge area. I just don't know where to start looking. Please, you're the only one that can help me!

;(Talk to Wyatt again)
:'''Wyatt:''' Have you found my key?
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid not.
:'''Wyatt:''' Well, it is quite a big search area... Good luck!
----
;(Upon beginning the search)
:'''Paimon:''' Wyatt was attacked by slimes &mdash; they must have left elemental traces all over him.
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, you'll have to use your Elemental Sight to find out where Wyatt has been...
:'''Paimon:''' If you follow the route that he took last night, you're sure to find his {{Color|buzzword|key}} eventually.
;(Upon not finding the key)
:'''Paimon:''' Doesn't look much like a key to Paimon. Try looking somewhere else.
;(Upon finding the key)
:'''Paimon:''' This must be Wyatt's key. Let's take it back.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Wyatt's Black Key}} or {{Item|Wyatt's Red Key}})
----
;(Return to Wyatt with the key)
:'''Wyatt:''' Found the key yet?
:{{DIcon}} I found this key &mdash; is it yours?
:'''Wyatt:''' Yes! That's the one. I can't afford to let that happen again... I really must rein in my drinking.
:'''Wyatt:''' Oh &mdash; and take these. Thanks for your help.
