{{Description|A restaurant and hotel rolled into one on the outskirts of the Chuwen Fair. Provides free accommodation and food to warriors taking part in the Pilgrimage. The name was once given in the hope that warriors would leave their weariness in the inn and step into the Stadium filled with energy. It is said that every manager of this inn was selected and designated by the Speaker's Chamber.|[[Map]] description}}
