==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Obata:''' Hey, would you like some fresh seafood? Inazuma offers the freshest fish in all of Teyvat!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about yourself, for starters...
:;(Before completing Transient Dreams)
::'''Obata:''' This island is my hometown. My whole family has been fishermen for generations. Naturally, I am a fisherman myself as well.
::'''Obata:''' ...But nowadays, even fishermen have become rare.
::'''Obata:''' Apart from restricting entry of outlanders to Inazuma, the [[Sakoku Decree]] also limits the areas in which we can sail.
::'''Obata:''' Many fishermen have changed jobs as a result. I am still here because of this vast ocean.
::'''Obata:''' More accurately, I can hear this ocean calling to me all the time...
::{{DIcon}} About the Sakoku Decree...
:::'''Obata:''' I'm not educated enough to know much about politics. As far as I am concerned, it's a decision that's resulted in lots of unhappiness.
:::'''Obata:''' The Sakoku Decree has not just decreased the volume of our customers, the limited sailing range has also made fishing a very tough job.
:::'''Obata:''' Ah, a fisherman who cannot sail freely is no different from a beached, salted fish... I really don't understand what is going on in the minds of those bigwigs...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} The sea's call?
:::'''Obata:''' Yeah! Do you hear it? The sound of the waves crashing against the beaches, the sound of the fishes swimming through the waves...
:::'''Obata:''' ...Eh? You still don't get it?
:::'''Obata:''' ...Hahaha, you must be an outlander. That's to be expected!
:::'''Obata:''' Here, I'll give you some of my catch. After you live by the ocean for a while, you'll start to understand the romantic nature of the sea!
::;(Obtain [[Fish]] ×10)
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I would like to have some, yes.
:;(After completing Transient Dreams (needs validation))
::'''Obata:''' Then I have all the seafood you need. Take your pick.
:;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
::'''Obata:''' This island is my hometown. My whole family has been fishermen for generations. Naturally, I am a fisherman myself as well.
::'''Obata:''' Due to the Sakoku Decree limiting our ability to go out to sea, we fishermen temporarily became a rare sight indeed...
::'''Obata:''' But those problems are all in the past now! The Sakoku Decree's gone for good &mdash; not only have the restrictions on fishing been lifted, but our Ritou clientele's grown too!
::'''Obata:''' It's time! I shall once again answer the call of the ocean, haha!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Obata:''' Aye! If you want some fresh fish, feel free to come back any time!
