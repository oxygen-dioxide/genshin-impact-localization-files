==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shiliu:''' Why won't anything sell...
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you sell here?
::'''Shiliu:''' Take a look and you'll see! Top-quality goods at low, low prices, all direct from Liyue.
:;(Opens shop interface)
:{{DIcon}} What won't sell?
::'''Shiliu:''' Jewelry. Even though I brought all of this personally from [[Mingxing Jewelry]] in Liyue Harbor. They're the best of the best, I mean, just look at these!
::'''Shiliu:''' ...You dress funny, are you a traveler? Fair enough... I guess now you're going to tell me that these are no use to you on your travels anyway. Right?
::'''Shiliu:''' *sigh* ...I totally misjudged this one. I thought I could increase sales by moving into Mondstadt...
::'''Shiliu:''' Little did I know, people here would sooner spend every last Mora to their name at the tavern than take a look at what I'm selling...
::'''Shiliu:''' Maybe they just can't afford it? Hmm... I suppose not everywhere is as affluent as Liyue...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Liyue.
::'''Shiliu:''' Ah, so you want to know about my hometown?
::'''Shiliu:''' Liyue has the busiest commercial port in all of Teyvat. There's merchants from all over the world there. Hehe, growing up in a place like that, I knew I wanted to go into business from a very young age.
::'''Shiliu:''' Have you heard of Lord Morax? The god who watches over Liyue?
::'''Shiliu:''' At the very least, you should know that the Mora you have there is named after him!
::'''Shiliu:''' Ah, I haven't been back in a long time. Maybe the reason I can't make any money is because I'm too far away from Lord Morax?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Shiliu:''' Surprise, surprise. Another no-sale!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* She is one of the few characters from Liyue to refer to the Geo Archon as '''Morax''' instead of ''Rex Lapis'',  outside the context of his connection to [[Mora]]. The others are [[Wanyan]] and [[Keqing]], who primarily calls him Rex Lapis, but is quoted as questioning if Morax knows everything in her Character Stories. Unlike them, Shiliu calls him ''Lord Morax''.
