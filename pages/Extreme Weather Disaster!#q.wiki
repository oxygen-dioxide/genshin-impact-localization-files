==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Read the wooden sign nearby, optional)
:'''Hazard Warning:''' "Volcanic eruption zone. Beware of extreme weather in the form of burning biological rain. This phenomenon causes widespread damage and is difficult to predict, make sure to pay attention to conditions overhead."
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's a little curious, she's gotta admit... Hehe, why don't we go explore the area up ahead?

;(Approach the fallen Kamera)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why is there a Kamera here? How about we open it up and take a look inside?

;(Interact with the Kamera)
:{{Black Screen|After inspecting the Kamera, you not only discover a set of photos of the surrounding scenery, but also a special mechanism within. It seems as if this mechanism causes the Kamera to automatically take photos whenever it detects vibrations running through the ground.}}
<!-- Kamera Settings -->
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, fire that moves like it's alive, eerie afterimages, and Kameras that can take photos automatically...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon has a hunch that there's some kind of mind-boggling mystery behind it all! Who knows, there might even be treasure involved!
:{{DIcon}} Any specific reason for this hunch of yours, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' To be perfectly honest... nope! But the Kamera's owner must have put it here to capture what happens when the ground shakes...
:'''Paimon:''' So all we've gotta do is put the Kamera back, then wait for the ground to start quaking.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, and when that time comes... Clues to the treasure's whereabouts will no doubt come rumbling out, just like that afterimage!

;(After resetting the Kamera)
<!-- Black screen transition -->
:;([[Flowfire Bird]]s start to drop from the sky)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! It's a Flowfire Bird! So that's why that warning said "biological"!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, they seem to be heading for the Kamera. {{Traveler}}, watch out!
<!-- Achievement unlocks -->

==Trivia==
* The Kamera's memory shows a cart being destroyed by a volcanic eruption. This is likely the topic of [[Masose]] and [[Itsaho]]'s conversation.
