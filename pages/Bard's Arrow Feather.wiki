{{Description|An azure arrow fletching that has neither faded nor splintered with the passage of time. The sound of running water seems to linger around it.}}
'''Bard's Arrow Feather''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Wanderer's Troupe]].

==Description==
An azure arrow fletching that has survived the test of time.<br>The fletching seems to produce a tune as the arrow flies through air.

The [[Sojourner|harpist]] of the troupe was also a skilled archer.<br>Legend has it that he could lure the birds in the sky with his [[The Stringless|harp]] and shoot them down with his arrows.<br>It is said that he never looked at the sky while he was playing the harp to lure the birds.<br>Some believed the reason was {{sic|his harpist's arrogance}}, while his companion said it was his hunter's mercy.

The ill-fated birds became the fletching of the harpist's arrows,<br>and the sound of the harp became the birds' elegy.
