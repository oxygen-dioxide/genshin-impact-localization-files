:'''Zhenxiang:''' Please wait while we perform a routine inspection.
:{{DIcon}} Inspection?
::'''Zhenxiang:''' Orders have come down from the [[Qixing]]. We have to check everyone who comes through here and be on the lookout for suspicious characters.
::'''Zhenxiang:''' Don't worry, unless there's an issue my Millelith comrade and I will give you no trouble.
::{{DIcon}} Why is your comrade slacking off?
:::'''Zhenxiang:''' He isn't slacking off. He's just... recharging.
:::'''Zhenxiang:''' He's in a league of his own in this job &mdash; he can do face reading! As in, he can tell instantly if you're someone to worry about, just by looking at you. Most I can do is ask a bunch of questions.
:::'''Zhenxiang:''' Thanks to him, it's much safer around here now.
:::'''Zhenxiang:''' I wish I could do what he does...
::{{DIcon}} Why are you the only one working?
:::'''Zhenxiang:''' My comrade knows the art of face reading, and he's right on the money every time.
:::'''Zhenxiang:''' He did me a while back. Said that as long as I keep working hard, and help out my comrades when needed, I will go from strength to strength in my career.
:::'''Zhenxiang:''' Covering for him while he takes some time out counts as helping my comrades, right? In which case, I'm definitely on track to do well for myself.
:{{DIcon}} Can you let me past?
::'''Zhenxiang:''' Hmm... Well, you're not on the blacklist, as far as I can see.
::'''Zhenxiang:''' While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail. Thank you for your cooperation.
