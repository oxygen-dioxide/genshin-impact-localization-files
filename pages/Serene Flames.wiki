|description    = A bonfire made of common "[[Otogi Wood]]." The square frame utilizes the abandoned barracks fence, and is extremely fireproof. The firewood is originally intended to be used to make weapons, but it is not suitable for conversion into agricultural tools. With the end of the war, both [[Watatsumi Island]] and [[Narukami Island]] have canceled their plans to increase the production of armaments, and the corresponding wood was naturally put to good use. The bonfires made from them symbolize the hard-won peace, and according to some soldiers, they can feel a kind of serenity when looking at the bonfire.
