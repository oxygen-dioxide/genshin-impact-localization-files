{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bernhard:''' Hello, Traveler, Paimon. I've heard that you've been participating in the Fecund Hamper event. Was it fun?
:'''Paimon:''' It's been pretty fun! Paimon isn't sure if it's because there was this market during Weinlesefest, but we got all sorts of decorations.
:'''Bernhard:''' Haha, there are indeed people who would prepare those as gifts. Right, since we're running a snack shop, do you want to put some of those decorations here?
:'''Bernhard:''' Prettying the shop up could help us attract more customers.
:'''Bernhard:''' Besides, I'm sure the gift givers would be happy to see their sincere gifts being used in your shop.
:'''Paimon:''' Good point! C'mon, {{Traveler}}, let's decorate our shop!
