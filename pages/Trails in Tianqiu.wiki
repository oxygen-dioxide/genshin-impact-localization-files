==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|There is a strange tablet in Tianqiu Valley that seems to relate some of the valley's history...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with the Ancient Tablet)
:'''Ancient Tablet:''' "At Tianqiu Valley the adepti's ancient trail grows cold, I fall down and weep at the ruins I see. Though defeated is mighty [[Azhdaha]] of old, there's [[No Restoring This Past Land of Beauty|no restoring this past land of beauty]]."
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... The words on this tablet are really hard to read.
:'''Paimon:''' So this a ruin, but it's also an adepti's trail, but it's also a ruin. Which is it?
:'''Paimon:''' Still, it says here that "At Tianqiu Valley the adepti's ancient trail grows cold." That means we can be sure that the event the stone tablet mentions must have happened at Tianqiu Valley.
:'''Paimon:''' Guess we've got no choice but to have a look around. Maybe we'll find something.
----
;(Interact with the Scratched-Out Treasure Hoarder Notes in the northern tower)
:'''Scratched-Out Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "What in the world is the solution to this puzzle...?"
:'''Scratched-Out Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "It's not like I have [[Yan'er|Boss]] to help either... she sent me to investigate this on my own. But it's going to take me forever!"
:'''Scratched-Out Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "I'm to the point where I'm trying to crack this puzzle in my dreams, or maybe nightmares is more accurate... I saw an old man squatting beside me with a wide grin, urging me to hurry up and solve the puzzle."
:'''Scratched-Out Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "Hmm, no... was it an old man or a young girl? ...Ugh, I can't remember."
:'''Scratched-Out Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "Anyway, I'll stick it out a few more days. If I still can't figure it out after that, I'll just have to get Boss to send someone else..."

;(Interact with the Old Treasure Hoarder Notes in the southern tower)
:'''Old Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "Boss says if we defeat every single monster, she'll finally get what she's seeking..."
:'''Old Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "But there are too many monsters here. We strike down one and out comes another &mdash; there's no end to them!"
:'''Old Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "And all of the guys who've been in start acting strange once they get out. They insist that the monsters followed them out, but I don't see any monsters around them."
:'''Old Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "The guy who was in there the longest told us to run away as fast as we could, saying something about a dragon-lord... What was he on about?"
:'''Old Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "There's definitely something strange going on around here... We should report it to Boss, and we should definitely tell everyone to get outta here."

;(Interact with the Scribbled Treasure Hoarder Notes in the western tower)
:'''Scribbled Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "The thing Boss wanted us to find should be at the top, but how do we get up there?"
:'''Scribbled Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "A pal said there is probably treasure in here. I can see a mechanism, but... how do we get the treasure?"
:'''Scribbled Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "Perhaps we have to run to the top in a certain amount of time in order to get the treasure... haha!"
:'''Scribbled Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "Anyways, let's find out what Boss wants fast and get outta here."
:'''Scribbled Treasure Hoarder Notes:''' "I have a strange feeling that someone is watching me..."
----
;(After activating the Light Actuator)
:'''Heartless Treasure Hoarders:''' Hahaha! Just like boss said, leave a few clues outside the door and rich idiots will come flocking in. We ought to thank you for finding the treasure for us.
:'''Heartless Treasure Hoarders:''' This is it. Let's take care of our little friend here and be on our way with the treasure. It's about time we got out of this place!
