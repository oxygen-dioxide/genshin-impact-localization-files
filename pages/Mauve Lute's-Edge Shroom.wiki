|description    = A large mauve-colored fungus that possesses a tenacious vitality and a unique surface that simultaneously grants great springiness and the ability to retain moisture for long periods. In theory, this fungus could be used to maintain the humidity of a courtyard, but they seem to only grow in special environments and do not take well to transplantation into more mundane locales.<br />It is said that it displays the special markings of the Lute's Edge art of calligraphic penmanship if you look at it from just the right angle, which is how it got its name.
