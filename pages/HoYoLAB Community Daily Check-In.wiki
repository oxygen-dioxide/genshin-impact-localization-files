'''HoYoLAB Community Daily Check-In''' is a web event that rewards players for logging into [[HoYoLAB]]. The page can be accessed through the HoYoLAB website by clicking the "Check-In" button on the right side of the webpage or through the HoYoLAB mobile app under the "HoYo Guides" tab.

Players must click on the latest available reward in the Daily Check-In page, which will be highlighted, to claim it. The Reward History tab records the time and date when a reward was claimed. If the player also happens to be logged onto a character of the corresponding account, the reward will immediately arrive in their mailbox.

==Rules==
#You can check in once each day. Accumulate certain amounts of check-ins in a month to claim the corresponding rewards.
#Rewards and check-in progress are refreshed on the 1st of each month at 00:00. This month's check-ins will not be counted toward the next month.
#After logging into your HoYoverse Account and checking in, all characters created under your account will receive the rewards via in-game mail that will be valid for 30 days. Make sure to claim the rewards in time. (Note: During server maintenance, there may be a slight delay in the delivery of rewards.)
#An account for PSN can be linked to a HoYoverse Account in the game, and check-ins can be carried out by logging in to the said HoYoverse Account.
#You can make up for a missed check-in, but only for the current month.
#You can only make up for check-in once a day and a maximum of 3 times a month for each HoYoverse Account. Make-up check-ins will automatically fill in the first missed date of the month. It is not possible to choose the date yourself.
#A Check-In Make-Up Card is required each time you make up for a check-in. You can get them by completing missions.
#You will receive an additional Primogems ×100 and Mora ×10,000 upon your very first check-in to the page.
