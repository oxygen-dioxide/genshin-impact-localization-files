'''Chichen Uctokah''', also known as the '''Land of Seven Flames''', was an ancient city once ruled by the [[Thirteen Sovereign Lords|Dragonlord]] [[Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L]], and upon which the "usurper" [[Och-Kan]] attempted to build his nation, [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|Ochkanatlan]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Open Your Heart to Me}}</ref>

Chichen Uctokah was built by the [[dragons]] as the base of a "stairway" or "cable" leading beyond [[Teyvat]], functioning alongside the satellite [[Tonatiuh]].<ref name=Omen>{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref> This concept closely resembles the hypothetical real-world megastructure known as a {{w|space elevator}}.

===Etymology===
*''Chichen Uctokah'' is possibly derived from the {{w|Chichen Itza}} composed of chi', meaning "mouth" or "edge", and chʼen or chʼeʼen, meaning "well". Meanwhile,  "Uctokah" is a possible combination of two {{w|Yucatec Maya Language|Yucatec Maya}} words that is ''uʼuk'' meaning "seven" and ''tokah'' meaning "burn."
