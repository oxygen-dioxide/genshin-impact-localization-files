|text    = My dads gave me a huge piece of cake to celebrate my birthday. Problem is, my real birthday only happens once every four years, so I feel bad about getting gifts today...

Without everyone looking after me, I'd surely have ended up alone in some forgotten corner of the world. No way I'd be as happy as I am today.

So... I prepared some gifts for them in return. And I also got something for you!

You're important to me, too. I&mdash;I want to show you how thankful I am...

If I could make a wish today, I'd wish for... for you to keep me company on my real birthday too, hahaha.

Oh, right! The [[Teyvat Charred Egg|egg]] might look slightly charred, but I'm sure it's perfectly edible! I cooked an extra portion to try myself before giving one to you. It's totally safe, so tuck in!
