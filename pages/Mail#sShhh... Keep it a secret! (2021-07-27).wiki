|text    = These last couple of days, Klee came up with a plan to go on a great big adventure before her birthday!

First, Klee managed to slip away while Master [[Jean]] was busy with her work~

Next, Klee ran off to a place that Master Jean will not be able to find! Klee ran and ran, and found a [[Primo Geovishap|great big lizard]] in a gigantic cave!

Then, Klee got very excited thinking about her birthday, and might have run off too far... Master Jean would be angry if she found out...

So, can you come pick Klee up, please? I'll be waiting!

Oh! Klee will give you the [[Juvenile Jade|strange stone]] from the great big lizard. If you find out how to make treasure with it, come teach Klee, okay?
