==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chatelet:''' A life without change, paired with unchanging coffee...
:{{DIcon}} That sounds a little boring.
::'''Chatelet:''' From the perspective of work, such trivial matters won't even make for good conversation-that much is true.
::'''Chatelet:''' I'm a Gestionnare at the [[Palais Mermonia]]. I guess you could call me an old colleague of [[Arouet]]'s.
::'''Chatelet:''' Arouet's opinions could be considered quite extreme in the office, but by cafe standards, they're quite ordinary.
::'''Chatelet:''' It must be said, though, that there can be no complaints about his coffee-making skills. Quitting his old job to run this place has been one of the best decisions of his life.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds quite relaxing.
::'''Chatelet:''' Indeed-the aroma of the coffee available here is wonderful. I can only hope Arouet will continue making it this way.
::'''Chatelet:''' But I do have my reservations about his statement that "coffee is the source of life."
::'''Chatelet:''' You must know, I'm sure, that not everyone loves coffee for its taste, but for its ability to impart wakefulness. 
::'''Chatelet:''' Where I work, there is much that many cannot control in their lives already-at least leave them their opinion on coffee.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Chatelet:''' See you, and may you stay happy.
