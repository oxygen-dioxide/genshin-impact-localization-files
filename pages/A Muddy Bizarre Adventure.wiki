* Enemies will spawn with a buffed status that grants them '''5%''' [[ATK]] and '''5%''' [[Resistance]] to all DMG. Enemies hit by the Pursina's Spike's shockwave will lose this buff until they step on dark mud again.

;Challenge Rules
You can obtain points by defeating monsters or clearing Oozing Concretions from the area in this stage. Score as high as you can to obtain the corresponding challenge rewards. Defeating a normal opponent will grant 100 points while defeating an elite opponent will grant 500, and destroying an Oozing Concretion will earn you 300. While the challenge is in progress, the Purina's Spike will unleash a shockwave every 5s that will deal DMG to opponents within its AoE and decrease their DEF.<ref group="Note">The official description is wrong. Pursina's Spike shockwaves decrease enemy RES, not DEF. See [[Pursina's Spike#A Muddy Bizarre Adventure]] for details.</ref> When the Spike is covered by dark mud, they will stop operating, and their functions will only be restored once the Oozing Concretions near them have been cleared away.
