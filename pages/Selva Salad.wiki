|description     = An Aranara-style salad that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. It is, in fact, a rather traditional recipe in Sumeru.
|desc_suspicious = Ripe — "slightly fermented" to be more precise — [[Zaytun Peach]]es give off a bizarre smell. And this is to say nothing of the disproportionate use of mints and roses...
|desc_basic      = Fresh and crispy [[Zaytun Peach]] slices and mixed with gently squeezed [[Sumeru Rose]]s, which adds a touch of distinctive flavor. Mint is used instead of sugar to avoid getting a sickening sweetness. A refreshing dish that pleases both the eyes and the nose.
|desc_delicious  = Crispy and juicy [[Zaytun Peach]]es are served with fresh mints and blooming roses. This delicacy tastes refreshingly sweet and feels pleasantly cool on the tongue &mdash; this must be "the Taste of Happiness," as Aranara say.
