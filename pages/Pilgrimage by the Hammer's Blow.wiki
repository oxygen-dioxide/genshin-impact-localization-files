|description    = A remarkably lifelike anvil model crafted in the traditional design favored by Natlan's blacksmiths. Its surface is made from a broad iron plate, supported underneath by a sturdy stone base. This structure is said to enhance the clarity of sound and force feedback when forging, catering to the unique rhythm some blacksmiths employ while hammering metal. Some individuals even repurpose these anvils as percussion instruments, performing forge-themed music, which is how this anvil earned its distinctive name.
