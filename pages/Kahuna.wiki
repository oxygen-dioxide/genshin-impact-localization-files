==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kahuna:''' Hey there! You looking for someone, or something?
:{{DIcon}} Hmm?
::'''Kahuna:''' Ah, so you're not a client. Sorry about that.
::'''Kahuna:''' I just know a ton of people, so over time, people have habitually come to me when they need something or someone found.
::'''Kahuna:''' If you need help hiring a wayfinder, feel free to contact me. I'll be around here all day, more or less.
::'''Kahuna:''' Also, don't worry about fees. I'm just helping out.
::{{DIcon}} What do you mean by "wayfinder"...?
:::'''Kahuna:''' Oh, I mean a whole bunch of [[People of the Springs]] who love exploring [[Natlan]].
:::'''Kahuna:''' If you think about it carefully, their job scope is similar to that of adventurers, they just call themselves something else.
:::'''Kahuna:''' As you know, our lands are rife with high-temperature regions, and people of our tribe can explore all sorts of places with the aid of our [[Koholasaur]]s.
:::'''Kahuna:''' As such, many from other tribes and tourists alike will hire wayfinders for convenience, whether as navigators or scouts.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, but I don't need help just yet.
::'''Kahuna:''' No worries. Maybe next time, eh?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kahuna:''' Gah! Can't believe I agreed to switch for the night shifts with that kid. What a mess...
:{{DIcon|Reputation}} About my reputation with the People of the Springs... ''(Available after unlocking [[Tribe Reputation]])''
::'''Kahuna:''' Ah, a friend, come to help! My thanks.
:;(Opens Meztli<nowiki>:</nowiki> People of the Springs Reputation menu)
:{{DIcon}} Hello. What is this place? ''(Available after unlocking Tribe Reputation)''
::'''Kahuna:''' This is the Obsidian Totem Pole. You might have seen ones like it in other tribes, but this one belongs to us, the People of the Springs.
::'''Kahuna:''' After you complete tribal commissions, the Pole will grant you corresponding recompense - and you'll also have my thanks on behalf of our tribe.
::'''Kahuna:''' As for anything else, go find [[Caramuru]] during the day shift! Can't be letting our primary appointment holder get off scot-free, you know?
:{{DIcon}} You can't swap back?
::'''Kahuna:''' Well, that wouldn't change much, in truth. It's either the day shift or the night one, you know?
::'''Kahuna:''' And this is an important spot, so someone's got to watch it.
::'''Kahuna:''' I still wanna give Caramuru a smack over the head, of course, but I'm the responsible one between us!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Kahuna:''' It's alright. This is personal business, so don't mind me.
