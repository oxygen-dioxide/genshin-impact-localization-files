'''Reptilians''', also called '''Vishap-people''', are a species originating from [[Enkanomiya]].

==Overview==
According to [[Enjou]], Reptilians were [[Bathysmal Vishaps]] in Enkanomiya who, after being defeated by humans, began evolving to survive by imitating humans and infiltrating their society.<ref name="TRGO Aftermath">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath}}</ref> Everything about them became indistinguishable from humans, save for their pupils, which stayed vertical and reptilian. Enjou believes that [[Tsumi]], a shrine maiden met in Enkanomiya during the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]] event, is one such Reptilian.

However, according to [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]], Reptilians are pure fiction, as the ancient documents of [[Watatsumi Island]] do not have any information about them.<ref name="TRGO Aftermath" /> Instead, she believes that Tsumi could be the last descendant of the [[Vassals of Watatsumi]]. They were [[Orobashi]]'s confidants who had a half-human, half-snake appearance, and could understand the language of both humans and reptiles. Over time, the Vassals of Watatsumi became more human-like and could only be distinguished by their vertical pupils.

Because of the co-existence of these two theories, there is currently no basis to confirm Tsumi's origin.
