|text    = Hahahahahahahaha! Thank goodness I came up with a brilliant idea this year and found this secluded island where I stayed for a couple of days to stay away from the crowds. And guess what? This year, I'm not spending my birthday in prison! Hahaha!

On the other hand, spending days arm wrestling against [[Pale Red Crab]]s with a branch brought no joy... But now, the time's finally come. We celebrate, big time!

Yes, yes, location first. How about the rooftop of [[Tenshukaku]], yeah? The place's high up with spectacular views and looks majestic. I would look great there. A real man like myself should have his birthday celebrated on top of Tenshukaku!

What about the celebration then? If it's not super-duper mega ultra awesome, it has to at least be mega ultra awesome!

Fireworks? Nah, too much hassle. Beetle fights or card games? I'd win for sure... but I don't want anyone to lose today!

Hmm... How about... roasting [[Lavender Melon|Lavender Melons]]? All good vibes and little could go wrong. But, it still needs to be grand! So we are going to roast... ten! Yep, you heard me right!

I, Arataki "Live Long and Prosper" Itto will live as long as [[Mt. Yougou]], hahaha!
