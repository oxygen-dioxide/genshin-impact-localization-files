|description    = A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.<br>These lizards have pretty red scales and will detach their tails to escape when caught.<br>Lizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.<br>Once they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up. They will, for reasons unknown, also turn bright green.<br>The worldly [[Chubby]] surmises that, on rare occasions, [[Sub-Space Creation]] might allow the lizards' severed tails to regenerate into a full-grown, independent lizard. However, this theory has not been tested on account of rules against animal cruelty in the Realm Within.
