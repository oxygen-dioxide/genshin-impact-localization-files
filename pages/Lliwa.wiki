;(Talk to Lliwa before starting ''[[From One Case to Another]]'')
:'''Lliwa:''' How troublesome...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Lliwa:''' Well, I have a little brother who's a lot younger than me. Maybe he's just in his rebellious years, but he doesn't get along with anyone...
::'''Lliwa:''' Bah, I'll only add to your troubles by telling you about this. Things will probably get better when he grows up!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Lliwa:''' It's no trouble. See you around.
