==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Alom:''' Two, four, five... Oh, looks like I missed the beat again.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy a weapon.
::'''Alom:''' Please, go ahead.
:;(Opens [[#Shop|Shop]])
:{{DIcon|Forging}} I'd like something made.
:;(If nothing has been forged)
:::'''Alom:''' What do you need? Let me see if I can make a sturdier one for you.
:;(If something has been forged but not collected yet)
:::'''Alom:''' Your previous order is complete. Do you have any other requests?
:{{DIcon|!}} What about ores in Natlan?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Alom knows)
:::'''Alom:''' Looking for intel on where to find ores around this neck of the woods, huh? I know some places where you can often find [[Condessence Crystal]]s, and sometimes even sturdier stuff like Magical Crystal Ore, but I can't leave right now. Are you able to gather them yourself?
:::'''Alom:''' I'll mark any such location on your map so you can go there and check things out. Be careful though.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Alom knows)
:::'''Alom:''' Sorry, I haven't heard of any good mining outcrops lately. Perhaps they've all been mined already.
:::'''Alom:''' Tell you what, come find me another time. If I hear of anything, I'll be sure to share it with you.
:{{DIcon}} What beat?
::'''Alom:''' Oh, don't mind me. I'm just playing some intense music in my head &mdash; the kind that's perfect for forging.
::'''Alom:''' I'm guessing you can't hear it? It's a pity that I'm tone-deaf as well, or I'd try singing it for you.
::'''Alom:''' But feel free to stand by and listen to the rhythm of my ironworking. Just think of it as a form of street music.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} That's quite the rhythm.
:::'''Alom:''' I'm not sure why, but this kind of rhythm helps relieve my fatigue from all the repetitive toil. Really keeps my energy levels up, you know?
:::'''Alom:''' Yeah, stone can sometimes serve as a musical instrument.
::; Obtain {{Item|Condessence Crystal|x=4}}
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Alom:''' Take care.
