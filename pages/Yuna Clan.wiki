The {{Lang|'''Yuna Clan'''|ja=右名氏}} is a great house in [[Inazuma]] that led the first navy of the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]. It is one of the oldest clans in the [[Watatsumi Island]] that escaped from Byakuyakoku (now [[Enkanomiya]]) under the guidance of the serpent god [[Orobashi]].<ref name="Life of Mouun">{{Ref/Book|The Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden}}</ref> The clan is best known for the twin sisters [[Mouun]] and [[Ayame]] who were leading figures in the battle between Orobashi and the [[Raiden Shogun]]. It is still famous to this day for their talent in whalesongs and the tradition of communing with marine life. Mouun entered the Sangonomiya Shrine and learned the culture of the Watatsumi people. Later she would be entrusted with leading the Sangonomiya navy.<ref name="Life of Mouun" />

===Historically===
*[[Mouun]]<ref name="Life of Mouun" /> (shrine maiden; possibly the eponym of the [[Mouun Shrine]])
*[[Ayame]]<ref name="Life of Mouun" /> (Mouun's younger twin sister; original owner of the domain [[Palace in a Pool]])

In addition, Touzannou, commonly known as [[Akuou]], was fostered by the Mouun sisters.<ref name="East Viceroy">{{Ref/Book|Debates on the "Viceroy of the East"}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*The kanji of the clan name literally means the "right name" (as opposed to the left name), though it does not make sense. Considering several abilities of [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] refer to the {{w|Ryukyuan religion|Ryukyuan mythology}} (indigenous religion of the southwestern islands in Japan), it may be a re-transliteration of the {{w|Okinawan language|Okinawan}} word ''yuuna'' ({{ja|右納}}), meaning "{{w|Hibiscus tiliaceus|sea hibiscus}}," a possible etymological root of {{w|Yonaguni}} ("Yunaguni" in Okinawan; lit. "Land of Yuna"),<ref>Japanese Wikipedia: [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/{{subst:#urldecode:%E4%B8%8E%E9%82%A3%E5%9B%BD%E5%B3%B6}} {{ja|与那国島}}]</ref> the westernmost inhabited island of Japan.
