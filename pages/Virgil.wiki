'''Virgil''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Aqueous Tidemarks}}.

==Profile==
Virgil was a member of an unspecified organization in [[Fontaine]], which is later revealed to be the same organization as Sonny, the Spina di Rosula.

After the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] arrived in Fontaine and walked around the [[Palais Mermonia]], they ran upon Virgil, who asked them to assist him in uncovering the [[Liliacruces Forum]], which was said to hold treasure. Virgil and his subordinates had tried to access the Forum before but were unsuccessful in their task, and convinced the Traveler to help despite his occasional speech mishaps which showed signs of extreme disdain. Upon reaching the area however, he discovered that he was mislead, as the place was actually the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]], which was used by the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]]. He believed that he could use the institute against [[Sonny]] but decided to eliminate the Traveler and Paimon first as to prevent potential witnesses.

Once they reached the end of the institute, Virgil trapped them in a room with a special self-regenerating [[Ruin Grader]], intending to loot their wealth after the automaton dealt with them, leaving them to their apparent doom. The Traveler and Paimon managed to escape by flooding the laboratory with water.

Returning to Palais Mermonia, the Traveler and Paimon then came upon Sonny and [[Luca]], who were likewise looking for Virgil to settle a score with him. Sonny and Luca were relieved to learn that they were not Virgil's friends and pinpointed his hideout to a hidden base underneath the [[Elton Trench]], where he was supposed to meet up with several [[Treasure Hoarders]] over a shipment of [[Sinthe]]. Upon beating up the Treasure Hoarders, Virgil arrived to the scene and was promptly beaten by the trio. Sonny and Luca were particularly unhappy with Virgil's conduct, especially the Sinthe dealing. Virgil attempted to make excuses but was promptly silenced by Sonny, who called him a worthless dross and that he would need a serious talk with whoever trained him, though telling Virgil that he did not have to worry about it.

After {{Quest|A Fontainian Message}}, the Traveler can find Sonny and Luca next to the [[Consigliere]] in [[Fleuve Cendre]]. If the Traveler asks about Virgil, Sonny gracefully changes the subject and inquires about the Traveler's interest in "fishing," offering them four pieces of [[fish]], implying that they killed Virgil.

===Appearance===
Upon first encountering him, he wears a set of overalls with dark gloves and high boots. He has blonde hair, a maroon shirt, and a black belt. During the quest ''[[Aqueous Tidemarks]]'', he styles a turquoise diving suit with a large helmet.

==Trivia==
* Virgil as a guide into Hell in Dante's {{w|Divine Comedy}} is perhaps paralleled here with Virgil taking the Traveler into the Institute with [[Ancient Log|a dark history]].
* The two assassins involved in dealing with Virgil are likely references to the characters {{w|Sonny Corleone}} and {{w|Luca Brasi}} from the epic crime film {{w|The Godfather}}. Virgil himself is likely a reference to {{w|Virgil Sollozzo |Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo}}.
** The act of Sonny giving fish to the Traveler is a reference to the scene of Luca Brasi's death in the film, where a dead fish is used as a symbol. In a similar vein, after receiving the dead fish, the protagonist and their companions also learn about Virgil's demise.
** In the film, Virgil Sollozzo is a heroin kingpin, paralleling Virgil's Sinthe business.
** In the stronghold where the Traveler defeats Virgil, the presence of [[Bulle Fruit]]s on the table is likely a homage to the symbolic oranges in the film, which foreshadow death and tragedy.<ref>Screen Rant: [https://screenrant.com/godfather-oranges-important-symbol-why/ The Godfather: Why The Oranges Are So Important]</ref>
