{{Quest Description|The famous artist from Fontaine, Julien, remains in Sumeru...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If the Gray Crystal wall had been removed prior to the Daily Reset)
:;(Upon obtaining the quest)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}, you remember that great artist from [[Fontaine]] we met before? He said he was fine, but to be honest, [[Paimon]] is still pretty worried about him...
::'''Paimon:''' We might be able to find him at his beachside camp. Why don't we go and have a look?
:<wbr>
:;(Approaching the camp)
::'''Paimon:''' Strange... Where are they? Pepper isn't here. Where did they go? Julien said he couldn't swim, so they're probably not in the water.
::'''Paimon:''' Could they have gone into that cave? Let's go in and take a look!

;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, isn't that Julien? He's surrounded! We've gotta go help him!

;(Talk to Julien)
:'''Paimon:''' Are you alright?
:'''Julien:''' I&mdash;I... *sigh* Thank you both for saving me.
:'''Julien:''' I had a wonderful dream last night. In my dream, [[Caterpillar]] was standing at the end of the pilgrim's path, waving at me, and in that dream... Well, it was strange. Why was the path just one cavern after another?
:'''Julien:''' But Caterpillar was there, standing at the very end of the narrow way, and so I ran toward him, but before I could reach him, the dog woke me up...
:'''Julien:''' Leaving the part with the dog aside for the moment, I believed this to be a good omen, and so I brought my sketching tools and set out.
:'''Julien:''' In the end... I wound up running through the maze like a headless [[Cicin]], and I was even attacked by [[hilichurls]]... Not only did I not escape, but I also lost the bag containing my drafts during the chase...
:{{DIcon}} I guess this is another day of losses for you.
:'''Julien:''' But can you blame me? This place is even harder to navigate than the sewers in Fontaine!&nbsp;...Wait, the people of Sumeru live in trees, right? Could this place really be...
:'''Julien:''' What do the people of Sumeru even, um, excrete...!?
:'''Paimon:''' This isn't what you're thinking about!
:'''Julien:''' *sigh* My life has been but a series of failures. One ill-advised step after another.
:'''Julien:''' Why did I leave my place of safety this morning? I saw a good omen in my dream, but it was just a dream, after all. Why did I take it for reality?
:'''Julien:''' I should've been completely honest about the trouble I'm in... If I had asked you to lead the way, I wouldn't have ended up in this situation.
:'''Julien:''' Oh, why did I leave Fontaine in the first place? My life there had not yet become untenable anyway... On the other hand, not a single good thing has occurred ever since I came here.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't give up just yet! We can still take you to see some awesome places. But for now, we'll help you look for the things you've lost!
:'''Paimon:''' Um, even though we're not sure if we can get them back in one piece...
:'''Julien:''' Haha, they might have been taken and used by hilichurls as toilet paper, for all we know! Well... Whatever the case... they weren't very expensive things anyway...
:{{DIcon}} Be honest, please.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah. Even if they aren't worth much in terms of Mora, they're precious to you, aren't they? We'll help you find them!
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, where's Pepper? Isn't it with you?
:'''Julien:''' Hmph, that heartless creature ran off a long time ago... It's probably relaxing in some hiding spot of its own right now.
:'''Paimon:''' That's kinda hard to believe...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, anyway, why don't you return to your camp first and treat your injuries? We'll come back and look for you once we find the lost items.
:'''Julien:''' Thank you, my... friends. Ah, what have we to rely on in this life but friends?

:'''Paimon:''' He said that he lost his sketches while fleeing, right? Then let's start by searching along the path!
----
;(Use Nahida's [[All Schemes to Know]] on Julien, optional)
:'''Julien:''' (Where did Pepper run off to again...)

;(Talk to Julien at the camp)
:'''Julien:''' Ah, my friends, the lost sketches...
:{{DIcon}} We haven't gotten them yet.
:'''Julien:''' I see. It's alright. They aren't valuable anyway...

;(Interact with the first spot along the path)
:'''Paimon:''' Didn't it get buried? Where could it be?

;(Interact with the second spot along the path)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, well this isn't it either. Maybe we should keep searching up ahead?

;(Approach the third spot along the path)
:'''Paimon:''' Strange... Why are these hilichurls standing around a drawing board? Huh, wait, are they the ones we ran into on the beach earlier?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... They really look like they're in the zone. Maybe we should avoid them for now. Let's go around them... carefully!

;(Aggro the hilichurls, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! Looks like we interrupted their art-appreciation session...
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;We weren't the ones who started this...

;(Interact with the third spot along the path, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph... Though it looks very much like it, this doesn't seem to be the drawing board Julien lost. Let's keep looking, maybe?

;(Talk to Pepper)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Isn't this Pepper? It seems to be guarding something, too! Wait, this feels kinda familiar...
:'''Pepper:''' (It seems to have recognized you and wags its tail.)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, is it guarding Julien's sketches?
:{{Black Screen|Pepper barks twice before leaving quickly...}}
:'''Paimon:''' And there it goes again. It was like this the last time as well... Speaking of which, what do the hilichurls need sketches for?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps they'd like some interior decorations.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, would they though...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps they use it as toilet paper...
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh! You have an awful imagination, {{Traveler}}!

;(Pick up the sketch)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Julien's Sketch}})
:'''Paimon:''' Well at least we found what we were&mdash; Whoops! The sketch fell out!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Isn't this Pepper? It looks exactly like Pepper... Is this really a drawing?
:'''Paimon:''' But why are the colors so strange... Is this a picture taken by some special [[kamera]]?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's head back to camp first! Paimon's got a feeling that Pepper might already be there.
----
;(Talk to Julien)
:'''Paimon:''' As we thought, Pepper's already back!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Julien! We found your sketches!
:'''Julien:''' Ah, thank you so much, my friends... To think that you went through all that for such worthless items...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't say that! Aren't you a famous artist from Fontaine? Your sketches would sell for a pretty sum, wouldn't they?
:'''Julien:''' Um, well, I suppose so... To be honest, I don't really think about things like that... True art should be priceless, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, no wonder you're a famous artist. Your words feel so full of... artistic flair! Speaking of which, Pepper was guarding your sketches when we found them.
:{{DIcon}} Just like before.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! Paimon thinks that it still cares a lot about you.
:'''Julien:''' You mean, that same dog who keeps leading me down strange paths no matter how long I've fed it, and leaves me to face the hilichurls on my own?
:'''Paimon:''' Well... I&mdash;It probably had some considerations of its own!
:'''Paimon:''' Even though you're saying all these things, you actually really like Pepper, right? You wouldn't have taken a photo of it using a special Kamera otherwise.
:'''Julien:''' Photo? What photo?
:'''Paimon:''' There's a picture of a dog clipped between your sketches, and it looks just like Pepper. The colors used were quite unique too. You must have used some sort of special Kamera to take that photo, right?
:'''Julien:''' Um... Actually, I drew that.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? S&mdash;Seriously? Guess you're pretty good, Mr. Renowned Artist. Not only did it look very lifelike, but your use of colors was also very... um, artistic!
:'''Julien:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' (Did Paimon say anything wrong?)
:{{DIcon}} (Don't ask me. I don't get it either.)
:{{DIcon}} (Perhaps this is art beyond your comprehension, Paimon.)
:'''Julien:''' I didn't want to draw like this... I just... wanted to become a first-rate artist. Do you also think it's an impossible endeavor?
:'''Julien:''' *sigh* Sorry, I shouldn't have lied to you, my friends. Once you tell a lie, you have to keep on lying... I've had enough...
:'''Julien:''' In truth, I'm just an amateur artist who can't "correctly" differentiate color the way other people do, but I didn't want to give up on my dream to become a true artist.
:'''Julien:''' With the help of... a friend's powers, I am now able to draw anything exactly as it appears &mdash; but I still can't seem to tell colors apart.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, you said that you can now draw anything exactly as it appears... Is that really something you can just... learn overnight?
:'''Julien:''' Well, this friend of mine is quite a powerful person.
:{{DIcon}} Really? That's kinda hard to believe.
:'''Julien:''' Or perhaps I should say that I have lost my ability to draw things in a way other than exactly how it appears. I suppose this is what they call "the price of power." I know it sounds a little outrageous, but...
:{{Black Screen|Julien replicates an Adventurer's Experience for you.<br>You study the replica and the original, and find no difference between them.}}
:{{Black Screen|The only difference, perhaps, is that after you read it, the replica only leaves a strange, blank feeling in your mind...<br>It feels like you did read it, and yet you didn't. Like time alone was wasted without any experience gained...}}
:'''Paimon:''' It really doesn't look any different from the original...
:'''Julien:''' Of course, I didn't become a famous artist of any sort, but I did become a real dab hand at counterfeiting.
:'''Paimon:''' But isn't that illegal?
:'''Julien:''' ...Exactly, and so after serving my sentence, I was determined to do something legitimate. This time, I will become a proper artist for sure!
:'''Julien:''' But this ability to draw things in such exactitude... If Caterpillar had not been the one to grant it to me, I would have named it a curse.
:'''Julien:''' I'm like a broken Kamera that can only create pictures with mismatched colors...
:'''Julien:''' I believed that if I made a pilgrimage along the path of the Oceanids, I would be able to find a cure... that would let me differentiate color just like other people can, and grant me creativity akin to that of an innocent child...
:{{DIcon}} Hold on. Who's Caterpillar?
::'''Julien:''' A friend... a most reliable friend of mine. It was he who told me that following the path of the Oceanids' pilgrimage would allow me to find a curative in Sumeru that can cure all hurts and give one a new lease on life.
:{{DIcon}} And what's this path of pilgrimage again?
::'''Julien:''' Caterpillar told me that this is the path that the Oceanids took, and that the end of that path was Sumeru, where I'll find a cure that would heal anything and grant me a second chance at life...
:'''Paimon:''' That sounds super suspicious! What sort of friend is this again?&nbsp;...Are you sure you didn't get tricked?
:'''Julien:''' He has seen so much &mdash; why would he need to trick me? It must be my fault... Like I said before, my life is but a series of failures...
:'''Julien:''' I guess this miracle cure must've been kept under tight lock and key, making it impossible for an ordinary man like me to find. I... I've already accepted that.
:'''Julien:''' The dog probably didn't even want to come with me to Sumeru &mdash; it wouldn't have caused so much trouble otherwise. I should've just left it in Fontaine.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon... thinks it definitely still wants to stay with you. It definitely loves your drawings as well... so c'mon, don't just give up like this!
:'''Julien:''' Thank you for comforting me... But I've already given up hope. You've come to my aid several times now, and yet I haven't been able to repay you at all...
:'''Julien:''' Once I have recovered, I will make preparations to return to Fontaine. This might seem like an impertinent request, but could you two guide me back to the main road?
:'''Julien:''' *sigh* If I had given up earlier, or stopped trying to fool myself... perhaps I would already be on the right path.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, if you just need us to guide you, that's fine. Since you've already made up your mind... let's wait until you're rested up!
:'''Julien:''' Thank you, my friends.
:;(Obtain {{Item|"Adventurer's Experience"}})

;(Talk to Julien again, optional)
:'''Julien:''' One of the good things about leaving the city is not having to specially prepare dog food. Pepper's very capable, in any case, and can procure its own meals.
:'''Julien:''' The bad thing, though, is that I lack any talent for combat or cooking. I suppose "city trash" is a fitting name for one such as myself...
:'''Julien:''' ...
:'''Julien:''' I should just focus on recovering.

;(Use Nahida's [[All Schemes to Know]] on Julien, optional)
:'''Julien:''' (If I could hire a reliable helper...)

;(Talk to Pepper, optional)
:'''Pepper:''' (Looks at you expectantly.)
