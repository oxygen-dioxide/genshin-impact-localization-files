An interactable object in Liyue at Wangshu Inn's topmost floor can be found. Interacting with it starts a puzzle.

{{Dialogue start}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Observe
:'''Rockery:''' (A basin of what seems like a rockery used for decoration. A strange marking adorns its peak.)
:'''Rockery:''' (Look for a similar-looking mountain in your travels in Liyue, and examine the peak of such a mountain carefully. Who knows if you may find something unexpected...)
{{Dialogue end}}

The peak is found near the [[Statue of The Seven]] at the [[Sea of Clouds]] to the south. At the top of the cliff is a dig site marked with a spade. Dig to uncover a [[Precious Chest]]. After the puzzle is completed, Rockery in Wangshu Inn is no longer interactable.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|The inn that stands at the southern end of Dihua Marsh seems to serve as something other than a resting place for guests. They say that Wangshu Inn is a haven for lovers' moonlit rendezvous. Folk stories also have it that even ones as august as the adepti sometimes bask in the moonlight here.|Viewpoint, [[Vigilant Guardians' Vantage Point]]}}
{{Description|A landmark within Dihua Marsh, built upon a massive stone pillar.<br />As most of the patrons that stop here are traveling merchants, the inn provides an area for them to trade and set up stalls. The view from the top of the inn is jaw-dropping — weather permitting you can see all the way to Mt. Qingce and Jueyun Karst in the distance.<br />Legend amongst the stalls says that the tower of the inn hides a mysterious secret, but that's as far as the legend goes, as no-one has ever been able to validify the claims.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}

==Trivia==
* Interacting with an [[investigation]] spot in Smiley Yanxiao's kitchen grants the player the [[recipe]] for [[Almond Tofu]].
* The interior of the rooms at Wangshu Inn resemble the furnishing set [[Cloudy Haze Dream-Court]].
* Wangshu Inn is mentioned in the descriptions of the following Furnishing items:
** [[Entrance Rug: A Warm Welcome]]
** [[Stone Lion Statue: The Knowing]]
** [[Tavern Rug: Home Away From Home]]

===Etymology===
* Wangshu is the name of a legendary coachwoman who drives the moon chariot in the ancient Chinese mythology.<ref>Baidu Enclyopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9C%9B%E8%88%92/6915290 {{Zh|望舒}}]</ref> It is also figuratively used as an archaic name for the moon. This may be an allusion to the fact that Wangshu Inn is actually an intelligence agency for [[Liyue]] ("Lapis Lazuli Moon").

===Design===
* The design of the Dihua Marsh area took many elements from {{w|Guilin}}, a city in south China. Wangshu Inn, as the signature building of the area, adopted features of Guilin architecture.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/oPeoiFHKnYI "Travels Afar" Scenic Spot Collaboration Documentary - Guilin Chapter]</ref>
** The level artists also used the 1967 wuxia film {{w|Dragon Inn}} as reference when they wanted to incorporate "the sense of 'there's more to this place than <nowiki>[what]</nowiki> meets the eye'" in Wangshu Inn's design.
