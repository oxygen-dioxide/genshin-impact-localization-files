{{Lang|'''Chan'er'''|zh=婵儿|zh_rm=Chán'ér}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Test of Courage}}.

She and her boyfriend, [[Junjun]], went on a date to [[Wuwang Hill]]. She had a bit of a tantrum, so Chongyun thought Junjun was an evil spirit and sought to exorcise him. But after the misunderstanding is cleared up, Chan'er and Junjun make up.
