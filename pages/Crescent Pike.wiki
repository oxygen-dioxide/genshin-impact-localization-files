==Gameplay Notes==
The passive effect adds an extra Physical hit after each Attack hit, as opposed to increasing the character's Normal and Charged Attack DMG.
For most builds, the additional hit deals significantly more damage than additional Attack DMG would: since the hit scales of {{Color|Physical DMG Bonus}}'''es''', its additional damage (before accounting for enemy DEF and Physical RES) is equal to:
 (ATK × PassiveDMG%) × (1 + PhysicalDMGBonus%)
(The additional hit does not count as a Normal or Charged Attack, so it does not scale from effects that increase Attack or Charged Attack DMG.)
For comparison, an increase to Attack DMG would increase damage by:
 (ATK × TalentDMG%) × PassiveDMG%

Also note that the damage applies after each hit of multi-hit attacks, which are common on Polearm characters.

==Description==
The whole world flocks to the commercial port of Liyue, much to the city's pride.<br>
With the tides of people also come exotic treasures.<br>
This spearhead is long and narrow like a needle, with a crescent-shaped blade extending from its base.<br>
Once the bearer has grasped its elusive design concept, this weapon becomes far more destructive than its counterparts.

Unlike the martial artists of Liyue, those from other lands are masters of the art of surprise, skilled at developing ingenious new tricks.<br>
This weapon is designed to exploit fatal flaws. Like a needle, it slips between the gaps in an opponent's armor. Like the powers of music and love, it finds its way past people's defenses.

The [[Blue-Eyed Spear Witch|designer]] of the Crescent Pike was said to be able to visualize the fatal flaws in life itself.<br>
As if drawn by some mystical power, the pike would fly from her hand toward her opponents' fatal flaws.<br>
"Perhaps all that lives waits willingly for death."<br>
So thought the designer, who could see that which was fatally undefended in each living thing, yet had no such fatal flaws in her own life.

Then she found music, and through music found love. And in love, she found her own fatal flaw.<br>
In the end, the pain of finality, which pierced her heart like a needle, finally brought the witch to a realization:<br>
"Fatal flaws are born of a fear of death. Fear of death is born of having things, and people, to care about."

"Oh, how I wish to see him but one more time, that [[Parsifal|thief]] who can neither be caught nor killed."<br>
"Oh, how I wish to hear his song but one more time. If I should survive, I shall certainly treat him&mdash;"
