|description     = Noodles that are as slender as the hairs on a dragon's beard.
|desc_suspicious = The all-consuming attempt to make the noodles as thin as possible caused the pieces to break up during the cooking process. This is harder than it looks &mdash; and you're in need of more practice for sure.
|desc_basic      = The green onion is fried in a wok before the soup and condiments are added. Last in are the noodles, after which the lot is ladled out and plated up. The noodles must be skillfully hand-pulled multiple times before they become extremely thin &mdash; a technique that makes this dish the most challenging noodle recipe in [[Liyue]].
|desc_delicious  = The slim noodles are as a waterfall, draping their way into a soup that has captured the very essence of the mountains themselves. The softer mouthfeel compared to the average noodle dish make it nigh impossible to stop eating once you've started.
