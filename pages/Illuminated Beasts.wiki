An {{Lang|'''illuminated beast'''|zh=仙兽|zh_rm=xiānshòu}} is a creature with supernatural abilities, including heightened combat prowess, extreme longevity, and the ability to speak human language. Most known illuminated beasts are also [[adepti]] and have signed a contract with [[Morax]] to protect [[Liyue]].

==Overview==
Little is known about the origins of illuminated beasts or what being an illuminated beast entails due to their conflation with adepti. Madame Ping mentions that the adeptal arts taught to them by Morax were part of their "illumination,"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part I}}</ref> which suggests that not all illuminated beasts are born illuminated. Further supporting this idea is the fact that [[Cloud Retainer]] and [[Mountain Shaper]] are both [[cranes]], but various species of cranes can be hunted like regular animals and display no sign of illumination.

Full-blooded illuminated beasts can shapeshift into human forms<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sky-Gazers, Land-Walkers}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|Moonlit Bamboo Forest (II)}}</ref> and create offspring with mortal humans.<ref name="RoJ5">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun: Qilin}}</ref> Such half-blooded children will be humanoid with a few non-human traits indicating their illuminated beast heritage; it is unclear how their illuminated beast heritage will affect their growth, aging, or mystical abilities, if at all. Of the two currently known cases, [[Ganyu]] is old enough to witness the fall of the [[Guili Assembly]] and the rise of [[Liyue Harbor]] 3,700 years ago, yet she has the stature of a teenager. On the other hand, [[Yanfei]] has the stature of a teenager, but she is young enough that her mortal mother is still alive and traveling with her father, a full-blooded adeptus.

==Known Illuminated Beast Types==
===Mammalian===
<small>The following types of illuminated beasts are depicted in-game to have mostly mammalian features.</small>

====Qilin====
The {{w|qilin}} are gentle creatures who refuse to harm any animal, living a vegetarian lifestyle, with fur as soft as clouds. However, when they do not live in times of peace, they will fight.<ref name="RoJ5" /><ref>{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|5}}</ref> Ganyu is half-qilin.

====Xiezhi====
No other instances of this beast has been observed in Teyvat lore with the exception for Yanfei, who is half-xiezhi<ref group="note">Yanfei's Character Demo featured the track [[Marching of Xiezhi]], confirming her bloodline.</ref>, and her father who is implied to be a full-blooded one. Xiezhi have not been described in-game, but have appeared as an ornament on Yanfei's stamper. The creature is depicted to be goat or deer-like in appearance with a pair of antlers behind the ears, and a fluffy coat.

====Deer-Like====
Two known illuminated beasts take the form of deer: [[Moon Carver]], and [[Skybracer]].

===Avian===
<small>The following types of illuminated beasts are depicted in-game to have mostly avian features.</small>

====Crane-Like====
A number of illuminated beasts are known to take the form of cranes: [[Cloud Retainer]], [[Mountain Shaper]], and the yaksha [[Pervases]].

====Unknown Taxon====
[[Xiao]]'s avian beast form has been teased in his character design, his [[Alatus Nemeseos|constellation]], and his yaksha alias Alatus. It is implied that he takes on the form of {{w|Garuda}}, a Hindu demigod, or {{w|Peng_(mythology)|Peng}} (can be seen in the Chinese translation of Alatus: 金鹏 ''Jīnpéng''), a creature present in both Chinese and Buddhist mythos.

In some lines of Genshin Impact merchandise, stylized depictions of Xiao's avian form has been shown. The bird form appears to be a finch-like, though this is inconclusive due to stylization.  Its plumage features multiple shades of teal, reddish eyes and Xiao's purple diamond symbol on its forehead.

==Trivia==
* In Chinese mythology, {{w|qilin}} are one-horned beasts with a dragon-like appearance, although details about their appearance vary greatly with different dynasties and regions. ''Genshin'' uses the Buddhist-influenced depictions of qilin as peaceful and benevolent creatures who will not eat flesh or harm living beings, and only appear in areas ruled by wise and benevolent rulers. While peaceful by nature, qilin will defend the innocent from the wicked.
** Qilin are seen as symbols of immortality, good fortune, and sometimes, fertility. Tales of qilin leaving a baby at a family's doorstep was integrated into ''[[Records of Jueyun: Qilin]]''.
** While mythological qilin only have one horn, ''Genshin'' depicts qilin with two horns.
* {{w|Xiezhi}} are also Chinese mythological beasts, often depicted as ox- or goat-like creatures with a single long horn. They are seen as symbols of justice and law who can instinctively distinguish right from wrong. A xiezhi will point out the faulty party by either ramming them with its horn or biting them.
* Qiqi uses the term "adeptibeast" to describe the (ultimately fictional) Cocogoat. This term is rendered in the Chinese version as {{lang|mini=1|zh=半仙之兽|zh_tl=a half-xian beast.}}

===Etymology===
* Like the adepti, the first character in the Chinese name for illuminated beasts is {{lang|mini=1|zh=仙|zh_rm=Xiān}}, a term that refers to {{w|Xian (Taoism)|Taoist Immortals}}.
** In Chinese art, ''xian'' are often depicted with symbols of longevity, including dragons, cranes, white deer, and foxes. The first three have been mentioned as illuminated beasts and/or adepti: [[Morax]]'s Exuvia takes the form of a dragon, Cloud Retainer and Mountain Shaper are cranes, and Moon Carver and Skybracer are deer (albeit not pure white).
