==Profile==
Arashani is an [[Aranara]]. In the past, it used to play with a human girl named [[Avin]]. When Avin lost the ability to walk and could not freely play outside of [[Sumeru City]], Arashani thought she forgot about the Aranara. When Traveler, [[Yoimiya]], and Avin meet another Aranara named [[Arapurva]], the two spirits arrange a meeting between them and Avin in a dream version of [[Mawtiyima Forest]].
