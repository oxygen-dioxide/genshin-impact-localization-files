{{Description|A fragrant flower that will bloom for all eternity and never wither.}}
'''Maiden's Distant Love''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Maiden Beloved]].

==Description==
The maiden's flower. Fresh and elegant just like its original owner.<br>The books say that this species of flower has long been extinct.

Just like that passage the maiden had read countless times in books:<br>"The damsel in distress was saved by [[Bloodstained Knight|the white knight]] in shining armor."<br>"And they exchanged flowers as blessings to one another."

Though a maiden's heart is said to change with the seasons, just like a flower,<br>This flower remained constant.<br>For her heart had stilled in that moment long ago:<br>The moment that she met the knight.
