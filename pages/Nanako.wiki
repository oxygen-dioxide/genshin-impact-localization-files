===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nanako:''' Huh, who are you? Are you just here to watch my master's humiliation?
:{{DIcon}} Your master?
::'''Nanako:''' I'm a disciple of the [[Meikyou Shisui Art]]. My master's name is Domon.
::'''Nanako:''' My master used to be a great swordsman and a Vision-wielder. He will become the best in the world one day!
::'''Nanako:''' However, my master has been very out of sorts after losing his Vision due to the Vision Hunt Decree. I don't know what to do...
::'''Nanako:''' My parents were murdered by pirates when I was little, and I was almost killed as well. If it hadn't been for my master, I would have been dead a long time ago.
::'''Nanako:''' I will never find a way to repay him fully. Now that he's in trouble, I have to find a way to help him get back on his feet...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nanako:''' No, I can't give up yet. I need to figure this out somehow...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nanako:''' It's you, Traveler. Long time no see!
:{{DIcon}} How've things been going lately?
::'''Nanako:''' Thanks to you and [[Guuji Yae]], my master has returned to normal again. He has been teaching us swordsmanship every day, and there's hope in his eyes again.
::'''Nanako:''' As his disciples, we shall also work harder to fulfill our goal of becoming the greatest swordsmen.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Keep up the good work.
::;(After completing ''[[Omnipresence Over Mortals]]''){{verify}}<!--This isn't available immediately after completing "A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades". It becomes available after completing "Omnipresence Over Mortals". However, the trigger can probably be earlier--> 
:::'''Nanako:''' Yup! With your encouragement, I'll definitely become strong!
:::'''Nanako:''' That reminds me. Recently, when I was training in the dojo, I discovered a foreign-looking weapon. Did my master study it to hone his martial arts...?
:::'''Nanako:''' Even if we kept it here, not many people will know how to use it. If that's the case, how about I give it to you? You came from another lands, so I think you'll be able to draw out this sword's true potential.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Harbinger of Dawn|20|x=1|type=Weapon}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nanako:''' Bye! I should be getting back to practice, at any rate.
