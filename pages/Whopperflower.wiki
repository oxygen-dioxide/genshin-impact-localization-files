{{Description|A bizarre mimetic plant monster that harnesses the elements in combat.<br />These plants lurk under the surface and ambush unsuspecting prey. With the passage of years, sufficient nutrition, and the right environment, it could even take root somewhere and [[Regisvines|grow into a giant tree]] that sways and spews elemental power...|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
'''Whopperflowers''' are dangerous plants that can be found all over [[Teyvat]]. Whopperflowers often disguise themselves as [[Sweet Flower]]s, [[Mint]]s or [[Small Lamp Grass]]es in the wild, ambushing the player if they try to pick up the fake plant. 

Whopperflowers possess higher than average [[RES]] to all damage types. In combat, they use aggressive elemental attacks and can burrow underground to quickly reposition. They will also periodically generate an elemental [[Shield/Enemy|shield]] while charging up and unleash a special attack if the shield is not destroyed in time. If the shield is destroyed, they will instead become paralyzed with reduced RES.

==Disguised Whopperflowers==
In some areas, rather than a Whopperflower wandering around, it may appear as a harvestable plant. If this plant is collected, elemental particles will appear in the surrounding area before the Whopperflower bursts from the ground, dealing elemental [[AoE]] damage in the process.

* '''Sparkles:''' Any standard collectible plant will glitter, signifying that it's a collectible item. A disguised Whopperflower never glitters.
* '''Elemental Vision:''' Any standard collectible plant will show a white silhouette like the player character or non-elemental enemies when viewed in Elemental Vision. The disguised Whopperflower doesn't have that white silhouette.
* {{DIcon}} '''Icon:''' Any typical collectible plant will show with its unique icon when the collect option pops up once the player is near enough. For the disguised Whopperflower, a dialogue bubble appears instead of an icon, similar to when talking to an NPC.
* '''Seed Dispensary:''' When carrying the [[Seed Dispensary]], disguised Whopperflowers will not show up as collectable seeds, setting them apart from real plants.
* '''Glow:''' This only works at night on Whopperflowers disguised as Small Lamp Grasses; regular small lamp grass will always glow a faint blue, the disguised ones don't.
* '''Quick Pickup:''' Tapping to pick up all nearby items at once (on mobile platforms) will not "pick up" disguised Whopperflowers, and they will stay in the ground.
* '''All Schemes to Know:''' [[Nahida]]'s utility passive [[On All Things Meditated]], which allows [[All Schemes to Know]] to pick up harvestable items, will not "pick up" disguised Whopperflowers.
*'''Groups:''' Disguised Whopperflowers are most commonly found around groups of real plants. When finding an unusually large amount of identical plants in one place, it's safe to assume one of them is a disguised Whopperflower.

==Trivia==
* Whopperflowers that feed for a long time end up becoming [[Regisvines]].
* During the Archon Quest ''[[Solitary Fragrance]]'', a group of Whopperflowers are found disguised as [[Glaze Lily|Glaze Lillies]], a disguise exclusive to this quest.
* During the Commissions ''[[The Flowers That Won't Grow]]'' & ''[[When Flowers Bloom]]'', a single Whopperflower disguised as a budding [[Sumeru Rose]] freeloads off of the farmers' watering and fertilizing. When they expect the budding rose to finally bloom, the Whopperflower reveals itself, but does not attack and instead flees to the wilderness.
* During the World Quest ''[[The World of Aranara]]'', Arama reveals that Whopperflowers are known as "Vanagni" in the Aranara language.
