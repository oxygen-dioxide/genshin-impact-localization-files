'''Non-Player Characters''' ('''NPCs''') are all [[character]]s that cannot be controlled by the player. This includes characters that have only been mentioned, as well as characters that may become playable in the future.

Though many NPCs can be interacted with in the open world at any time, others only appear during [[quest]]s or [[event]]s, and are categorized as [[:Category:Quest-Exclusive NPCs|quest-exclusive]] and [[:Category:Event-Exclusive NPCs|event-exclusive]] NPCs respectively.

Some open-world NPCs serve additional functions, such as exchanging items with the player, allowing the player to interact with a game system like [[Reputation]], or initiating time trials.

For a complete list of all NPCs, see [[NPC/List]].

==Vendor NPCs==
{{Main|Shops}}
Some NPCs in ''Genshin Impact'' serve as shop vendors and will sell items to players. Most shops will restock their wares every day. Detailed lists of the items offered can be found on the vendors' pages.

Some shops are major shops, and their vendors have their own map icon. These major shops appear in every [[region]].

===Behavior===
* Most [[talent]]s performed near NPCs cause them to flinch. (The "landing" location of talents and their damage do not matter; what matters is the active character's distance from an NPC when using a talent<!-- and whether or not the character is facing the NPC, but unsure how to smoothly work this in English-wise -->.) However, there are certain Talents that cause NPCs to clap. Below is list of all talents that trigger clapping: <!-- Verified up to Varesa & Iansan / 5.5
Currently Unverified Characters: None	
 -->
** Amber: [[Explosive Puppet]]
** Baizhu: [[The Classics of Acupuncture]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Universal Diagnosis]], [[Holistic Revivification]]
** Barbara: [[Whisper of Water]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Let the Show Begin♪]], [[Shining Miracle♪]]
** Bennett: [[Fantastic Voyage]]

** Citlali: [[Dawnfrost Darkstar]]
** Diona: [[Icy Paws]]
** Faruzan: [[The Wind's Secret Ways]]
** Fischl: [[Nightrider]], [[Midnight Phantasmagoria]]
** Furina: [[Salon Solitaire]] ({{Pneuma}} version only)
** Gaming: [[Bestial Ascent]]
*** Additionally, both variations of his Wushou dance idle animation cause NPCs to clap.<!-- technically not a Talent, it will stay here for now, a new list will be made if there is a significant number of idles that cause clapping in the future -->
** Gorou: [[Inuzaka All-Round Defense]]
** Jean: [[Dandelion Breeze]]
** Kamisato Ayaka: [[Kamisato Art: Senho]]
** Klee: [[Jumpy Dumpty]], [[Sparks 'n' Splash]]
** Layla: [[Nights of Formal Focus]], [[Dream of the Star-Stream Shaker]]
** Lynette: [[Enigmatic Feint]]
** Mavuika: [[The Named Moment]] (Tap activation and Tap stance change only)
*** Additionally, the Idle animation "Summon Flamestrider" and "Blazing Hair" will cause NPC to clap.
** Mona: [[Ripple of Fate]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Mirror Reflection of Doom]], [[Stellaris Phantasm]], [[Illusory Torrent]]
** Nahida: [[Akara]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[All Schemes to Know]], [[Illusory Heart]]
** Ningguang: [[Jade Screen]]
** Sangonomiya Kokomi: [[The Shape of Water]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Kurage's Oath]], [[Nereid's Ascension]]
** Traveler (Pyro): [[Flowfire Blade]] (Tap and Hold)
** Xiangling: [[Guoba Attack]]
** Xianyun: [[White Clouds at Dawn]] (excluding Driftcloud Wave)
** Xilonen: [[Yohual's Scratch]]
** Xingqiu: [[Guhua Sword: Raincutter]]
** Yaoyao: [[Raphanus Sky Cluster]]
** Yoimiya: [[Niwabi Fire-Dance]], [[Ryuukin Saxifrage]]
** Yumemizuki Mizuki: [[Pure Heart, Pure Dreams]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Aisa Utamakura Pilgrimage]], [[Anraku Secret Spring Therapy]]
* If a player blocks the path of a walking NPC for a certain amount of time (e.g., using constructs generated by Elemental Skills), they will disappear to spawn somewhere else to continue their walking route.
* Some NPCs such as [[Marla]] and [[Glory]] are seated on benches at their overworld locations. Players can manipulate how they spawn:
** If the one seat on the bench the NPC usually sits on is occupied, they will spawn on another available seat.
** If all seats of the bench are occupied, the NPC will spawn in front of the bench, standing. Once a seat becomes vacant, they will sit down on that spot.
* Although NPCs usually have their dialogue voiced only in important quests such as [[Archon Quest]]s and [[Story Quest]]s, most NPCs also have an idle voiced line that will play at random intervals while a player is nearby.
* NPCs who travel between locations may stop at certain locations for a certain period of time before traveling again. An example of such an NPC is [[Schulz]].
* The internal timers keeping track of how long a moving NPC should wait at a certain location before moving again and how long an NPC should wait before saying their isle voice line again do not pause when the game's [[time]] is paused by the player. For this reason, keeping the game paused for some time next to multiple NPCs will often result in all of them playing their voice lines and resuming moving at the same time when the player resumes the game.
