'''Non-Player Characters''' (NPCs) are all [[character]]s that cannot be controlled by the player. This includes characters that have only been mentioned, as well as characters that may become playable in the future.

Though many NPCs can be interacted with in the open world at any time, others only appear during [[quest]]s or [[event]]s, and are categorized as [[:Category:Quest-Exclusive NPCs|quest-exclusive]] and [[:Category:Event-Exclusive NPCs|event-exclusive]] NPCs respectively.

Some open-world NPCs serve additional functions, such as exchanging items with the player, allowing the player to interact with a game system like [[Reputation]], or initiating time trials.

For a complete list of all NPCs, see [[NPC/List]].

==Vendor NPCs==
{{Main|Shops}}
Some NPCs in Genshin Impact serve as shop vendors and will sell items to players. Most shops will restock their wares every day. Detailed lists of the items offered can be found on the vendors' pages.

Some shops are major shops, and their vendors have their own map icon. These major shops appear in every [[region]].

==Dialogue Reward NPCs==

{{Transclude|Character/Notable|Notable Characters}}

===Behavior===
* Most [[talent]]s performed near NPCs cause them to flinch. (The "landing" location of talents and their damage do not matter; what matters is how close the active character is to an NPC when using a talent.) However, there are certain Talents that cause NPCs to clap. Below is list of all talents that trigger clapping:<!-- fully updated through Alhaitham and Yaoyao (Version 3.4) -->
** Amber: [[Explosive Puppet]]
** Barbara: [[Whisper of Water]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Let the Show Begin♪]], [[Shining Miracle♪]]
** Bennett: [[Fantastic Voyage]]
** Diona: [[Icy Paws]]
** Faruzan: [[The Wind's Secret Ways]]
** Fischl: [[Nightrider]], [[Midnight Phantasmagoria]]
** Gorou: [[Inuzaka All-Round Defense]]
** Jean: [[Dandelion Breeze]]
** Kamisato Ayaka: [[Kamisato Art: Senho]]
** Klee: [[Jumpy Dumpty]]
** Layla: [[Nights of Formal Focus]], [[Dream of the Star-Stream Shaker]]

** Yoimiya: [[Niwabi Fire-Dance]], [[Ryuukin Saxifrage]]
* If a player blocks the path of a walking NPC for a certain amount of time (e.g. using constructs generated by Elemental Skills), they will disappear to spawn somewhere else to continue their walking route.
* Some NPCs such as [[Marla]] and [[Glory]] are seated on benches at their overworld locations. Players can manipulate how they spawn:
** If the one seat on the bench the NPC usually sits on is occupied, they will spawn on another available seat.
** If all seats of the bench are occupied, the NPC will spawn in front of the bench, standing. Once a seat becomes vacant, they will sit down on that spot.
* NPCs who travel between locations may stop at certain locations for a certain period of time before traveling again. An example of such an NPC is [[Schulz]]. The time they spend stopped at a certain location does not pause when the game's [[time]] is paused.
