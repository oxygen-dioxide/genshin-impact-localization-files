Hapless traveler, what brings you to this deep underground cave?<br />
Did the legendary tales of [[Hasad the Golden Adventurer]] entice you so?<br />
Know that the tales told the world over are but a speck of sand compared to what I have experienced.<br />
Only the [[Scarlet King|nameless god of the desert]] knows what terrible misfortune has befallen me.<br />
Those ancient secrets unbeknownst to anyone,<br />
They have laid layer upon layer of curses on me,<br />
And I have become the oracle of a creature invisible.

Three challenges I have set forth, by order of the evil spirit watching me from the shadows.<br />
Within them I hide treasures brought forth from the cursed city of brass.<br />
If fear shall not stay your greed and curosity,<br />
Then follow my path.

Beside the deep tunnel that leads to the pit of filth where countless Dev once dwelt,<br />
The wails and screams of death echo across the ruins.

When the flames are lit in the correct order,<br />
In the same way you came here,<br />
I shall be free from this endless curse.

But those eternal beings can never perish,<br />
Until death is become the end of death.

Deep in the desert of eternal desolation, there are things even older than the ancient pyramids.<br />
Those are the sinister whispers of the spirits of al-Azif, each one of them repeating that accursed name:<br />
Shiruyeh.
