{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Open the chest after solving the puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon can't stand how these objects look... Somehow, it reminds Paimon of those ugly things we saw last time...
:'''Paimon:''' {{color|buzzword|Why is there a Hydro Monument buried underground}}? Paimon doesn't get it...
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, should we rearrange it? Just like how [[Salsa]] taught us!

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' It'll take some effort, sure, but...
:'''Paimon:''' We'd best {{color|buzzword|not leave the Hydro Elemental Monument sunken in the ground}}, that would be too weird!

;(If the player walks away from the puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? A Hydro Elemental Monument... Are you just gonna leave it there? Paimon thinks it would look better over there...

;(If the player returns to the puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Guess Paimon understands Salsa a bit more now... Just looking at it hurts her eyes!
:'''Paimon:''' How about we lift the Hydro Elemental Monument up?

;(Bury the Hydro Monument deeper, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! What're you doing, {{Traveler}}? That can't be right!
----
;(Lift the Hydro Monument)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew, this looks so much better. Salsa would be proud of us if she saw this, don't you think so, Traveler?
:'''???:''' Robbers! A robbery in broad daylight!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh!? Robbers? Where?
:'''???:''' I'm talking about you two! Not only did you destroy my masterpiece, you even took the chest...
:{{DIcon}} So it really was the work of an Adventurers' Guild member...
::'''???:''' What work on earth? I should be asking you guys about what you did!
:{{DIcon}} Wait, it's the evil green guy!
::'''???:''' Hah, a robber who is spouting nonsense. What a day it is today!
:'''Paimon:''' So, these ugly things are your "masterpieces"?
:'''???:''' The audacity! What do you mean "ugly things"? Haven't you heard of installation art?
:'''???:''' Looks like Fontaine's art education still has a long way to go... Oh, but you two don't look like you're from Fontaine.
:'''Paimon:''' That's because we are not from Fontaine. Paimon's Paimon, and {{MC|m=he|f=she}} is {{Traveler}}. We are also members of the Adventurers' Guild.
:{{DIcon}} We are members of an evil organization... *sob*
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, but we don't have to wear uniforms. So we're not bad guys in green, yay!
:{{DIcon}} Well hello there, buddy.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't think you can call someone buddy when you don't even know their name...
:'''Ubu:''' I'm Ubu, an adventurer and installation artist. Seeing how you guys are making zero sense, I'm guessing you're often up to crazy shenanigans... I won't pursue this matter this time.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Actually...
:'''Ubu:''' What? I need to restore the work, so if you want to say thank you, do it quickly.
:'''Salsa:''' I have nothing to thank you for, but I sure have a million things I wanna yell at you for!
:'''Paimon:''' Salsa!
:'''Salsa:''' With me around, you don't have to be scared, Paimon!
:'''Salsa:''' Evil green guy, we have destroyed all of the traps laid by you! Stop trying to ruin our beautiful Fontaine with your sinister traps!
:'''Ubu:''' Ruin? Wait, "destroyed all"?&nbsp;...You destroyed all of my artworks!?
:'''Paimon:''' Umm, we didn't exactly destroy them... We just rearranged them to suit the surrounding scenery...
:'''Ubu:''' You...! You brats and plebeians! How could you hope to understand art! To turn my installation art, my works into something so mediocre and mundane...
:'''Paimon:''' But is it really art? Paimon doesn't know much about it, but can you really call something that looks so out of place art?
:'''Ubu:''' Of course, the boundaries of art are set by the artist. A work created by an artist is naturally called a work of art.
:'''Salsa:''' Who's the artist?
:'''Ubu:''' It is I, Ubu, the extraordinary installation artist.
:'''Salsa:''' In that case, as the founder of the "Alliance of Artists to Overthrow the Evil Organization and Protect the Future of Fontaine," I declare that I do not recognize it as art.
:'''Ubu:''' "Overthrow the E&mdash;"&nbsp;...What?
:{{DIcon}} Overthrow the Evil Organization.
::'''Paimon:''' It refers to the Adventurers' Guild that is ruining the scenery with, umm, installation art...
:{{DIcon}} Basically, we have to take you down.
:'''Ubu:''' What a joke, I've never heard of such an alliance. Kid, what gives you the right to say that my work isn't art?
:'''Salsa:''' I'm a painter, so you could say I'm an artist. Of course I'm qualified.
:'''Ubu:''' Huh? Look, kid, being an artist isn't some child's play. You can't say you're an artist just because you want to become one. You gotta have works that are recognized by people...
:'''Salsa:''' So what makes you qualified? Your works, the installation art you speak of... Those evil traps? Do people clap when they see them?
:'''Ubu:''' That's because there are too many plebeians who can't comprehend the charm of my works. True art is always the least understood...
:{{DIcon}} You should start from making art that people can actually understand.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, if no one understands, it's either too avant-garde, or simply...
:{{DIcon}} Simply put, no one understands it at all.
::'''Paimon:''' Which sounds like a failure...
:'''Ubu:''' No... It can't be! My works are perfect! There is absolutely nothing wrong with them! You guys just don't understand, people just don't understand...
:'''Ubu:''' Darn it, I'm not giving up! This isn't over!
:{{Black Screen|Ubu stumbles away...}}
:'''Salsa:''' What a stubborn enemy! But I'm not giving up either! The future of Fontaine's art rests on my shoulders!
:{{DIcon}} We all have a goal to work towards.
:'''Paimon:''' Is this a good thing? It probably is, right?

;(Talk to Salsa again, optional)
:'''Salsa:''' Hello, {{Traveler}} and Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} Did you manage to recruit new members for the alliance?
::'''Salsa:''' I found prospective members who are willing to participate, but I need to carry out a rigorous assessment to make sure they have the right qualifications. After all, Fontaine's future is at stake.
:{{DIcon}} Not rushing home today?
::'''Salsa:''' I've finished my homework, so I thought I'd hang around a little longer before heading home...
