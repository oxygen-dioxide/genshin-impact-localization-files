<!---
'''Note''': If you enter another player's world in [[Co-Op Mode]], it either appears to search for Dendroculi based on what's in your world or just won't find any (and will display the animation that none are found). Since none will be found, it won't be consumed.

[[Oculus Resonance Stone]]s are crude imitations of the Statues of The Seven constructed by the ancients. Some think that it is the very crudeness of such stones that makes them seek out the power of elemental [[oculi]] - their crudeness makes them crave the power of the statues in the hope that they might replace them.|[[Archive]]}}
