==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kira:''' According to instructions from the [[Akademiya]], the latest marine conditions...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Kira:''' I'm a local fisherman. Other than fishing, I'm also a contact for the researchers sent by the Akedemiya.
::'''Kira:''' The Akedemiya would take a portion of our catch in exchange for helping us fishermen to determine the distribution pattern of marine life and plan fishing seasons and moratoriums.
::'''Kira:''' It's a good deal for us to exchange some fish for the assurance of bountiful hauls and safe voyage.
::'''Kira:''' I remember it was calm one day, but [[Alhaitham|a Scribe]] passing through pointed at how odd that sort of tranquility was and saved us from a stormy sail.
::'''Kira:''' That only convinced us to follow the Akademiya even more, and we hope the relationship will continue.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kira:''' Goodbye. Only by understanding the sea will you get to enjoy its treasure.
