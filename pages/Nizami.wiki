==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
Before completing ''Scenes from Life in Meropide: Fists of Fury''.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nizami:''' Are there any strong opponents...?
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Nizami:''' I'm a bodyguard. Have you seen my employer? He's pretty obvious, since there's nothing else green around here.
::'''Nizami:''' Is there anything to worry about here? I've got nothing to do. I take part in [[Pankration Ring|Pankration]] matches when I can, to keep active. But it's just not enough to scratch my itch, nowhere near enough!
:{{DIcon}} About the Fortress of Meropide...
::'''Nizami:''' It's annoying that fights are banned outside of the arena. And there are hardly any monsters nearby... I need a place to cut loose and put my fists and feet to good use.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your time.
::'''Nizami:''' Until next time.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
After completing ''Scenes from Life in Meropide: Fists of Fury''.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nizami:''' You! You're a good opponent.
:{{DIcon}} How have you been lately?
::'''Nizami:''' Quite well! Apart from the fact I have nothing to do... I go and spar with [[Roussimoff]] now and then, to stay active. But it's not enough!
::'''Nizami:''' But you, fighting with you is exciting. Especially when I lose.
::'''Nizami:''' Losing shows me where my weaknesses are, and that means I know how to keep getting stronger. Losing is to win, too. Makes sense, no?
:{{DIcon}} About the Fortress of Meropide...
::'''Nizami:''' It's annoying that fights are banned outside of the arena. And there are hardly any monsters nearby... I need a place to cut loose and put my fists and feet to good use.
::'''Nizami:''' As for the strongest fighter in the Fortress of Meropide, I've got a candidate in mind. But he seems very busy and I rarely see him.
::'''Nizami:''' And I'm not yet qualified to spar with him. I wonder if I'll get a chance before I leave Fontaine?
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your time.
::'''Nizami:''' Until next time. I'll keep training. You shouldn't slack off, either.
