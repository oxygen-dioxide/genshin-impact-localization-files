===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Setting Sail]].''
:'''Suling:''' Sorry, but I still need to check on our weapon readiness. If this isn't important, then don't bother me.
:{{DIcon}} Who may you be?
::'''Suling:''' I'm the Alcor's chief smith. I'm also in charge of all the weapons used in this fleet.
::'''Suling:''' If you're looking for a metalsmith, go hit Hanfeng's Ironmongers up. The boss there, Master Zhang, is my cousin. His craft is the finest there is in [[Liyue Harbor]].
::'''Suling:''' When it comes to smithing metals, I'm not his equal... but if we talk about familiarity with weapons, I don't believe myself inferior to anyone.
::'''Suling:''' I joined Captain [[Beidou]]'s crew to get a chance to look at rare and unusual weaponry.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Suling:''' If you find some interesting weapons, be sure to let me have a look at them.

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Setting Sail]].''
:'''Suling:''' Hello there, Traveler! Sorry for the scant welcome, but I need to check on our weapon readiness, as always...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about yourself, if you would...
::''(Same as "Who may you be?", above)''
:{{DIcon}} You seem awfully busy.
:;(After completing ???)
::'''Suling:''' Heh, well, it's actually alright. The busiest I've been lately was when we were back in Inazuma. The Captain even told me to get geared up for some rough times.
::'''Suling:''' I heard the other crew members praising you to the skies after our romp there.
::'''Suling:''' Well, if you've got any ideas on how we can improve our weaponry, remember to give me a shout!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::''(Same as before)''
