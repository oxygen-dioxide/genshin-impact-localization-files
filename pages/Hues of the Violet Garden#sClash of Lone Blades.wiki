===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Clash of Lone Blades 1.png
|text1  = Each of the warriors you will face during the Clash of Lone Blades has a different set of sword techniques, including ordinary techniques and exceedingly powerful but less often used Honed Techniques. After speaking with your challenger, you can {{Color|help|check your opponent's Honed Techniques via the menu}} to better understand their skills and make it easier to emerge victorious.
|image2 = Tutorial Clash of Lone Blades 2.png
|text2  = You will be unable to use Elemental Skills or Bursts during these duels, but you will obtain a new ability known as a Parry. When using this skill, the Traveler will raise their weapon in a defensive stance, greatly decreasing DMG taken. Parry has a fixed CD.
|image3 = Tutorial Clash of Lone Blades 3.png
|text3  = If you get the timing right and Parry just as your opponent is striking, you can complete eliminate any DMG that would be done to you, and will reset Parry's CD. Completing such a "Perfect Parry" against an ordinary technique will grant you 1 stack of Valor, and a Perfect Parry against a Honed Technique will grant you 3 stacks. Max 3 stacks. Valor stacks ensure that your next attack will be a CRIT Hit, dealing massive DMG to your opponent. All Valor stacks will be consumed by this CRIT Hit, and the DMG dealt increases based on the number of Valor stacks possessed.
|image4 = Tutorial Clash of Lone Blades 4.png
|text4  = When each warrior is about to use their Honed Techniques, their weapon will shine brightly. Perfectly Parry these techniques to unleash powerful counterattacks and deal great DMG to your opponents.

==Trivia==
* If the Traveler Perfect Parries DMG dealt by burning [[grass]] during these challenges, they will heal themselves for a large amount.<ref>Streamable: [https://streamable.com/p65fb2 Traveler Parry Healing]</ref>
* The "Borrowed Advertisement Board" on the island reads "Attention, all: The hot-blooded, cold-blooded, steel-blooded contest of warriors that I, Yasuhiko Tarou, have organized is presently underway!" This is a reference to the character Oshino Shinobu from Nisio Isin's ''Monogatari'' series, whose nickname is "The Hot-blooded, Cold-blooded, Iron-blooded Vampire."
