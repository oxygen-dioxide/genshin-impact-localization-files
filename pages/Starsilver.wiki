{{Description|A rare and precious ore formed by the unique geographical conditions and Ley Lines of Dragonspine.}}
'''Starsilver''' is a [[Forging Material]] item. They are used when [[Forging]] for [[Fine Enhancement Ore]] and a variety of [[weapons]].

==How to Obtain==
Starsilver can be mined only in [[Dragonspine]].

They can be harvested by attacking their destructible nodes, dropping 1-3 Starsilver each. Like all [[Geo Constructs]], it is faster to destroy them using [[Blunt Attack]]s and {{Geo}} abilities. Their respawn rate is 48 hours.

In [[Co-Op Mode]], each nearby player will get their own drops with amounts randomized separately and players will not be able to see others' drops. Unlike most [[Materials]], they cannot be affected by {{Anemo}} abilities that may move them.

* The following birthday mails included Starsilver:
** [[Birthday/Tartaglia#Finally, the day has come!|Tartaglia's 2021 Birthday Mail]] (5 Starsilver)
* Apart from forging items, Starsilver is also used for painting purposes, although this requires high-quality Starsilver as lower-quality ones are deemed a fake or copy.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Snowy Past}}</ref>
