{{Description|A man-made flower in eternal bloom. Who knows if there truly is life in there?}}
'''Summer Night's Bloom''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Retracing Bolide]].

==Description==
A summer festival flower that blooms forever,<br />That will not wilt even if buried deep below the snow.

Some may label it an imitation, a false life,<br />For life lies in change, pain and growth,<br />In meetings, and also in partings.

But the memories of meeting her,<br />Of watching the fireworks bloom in the sky like fresh flowers together,<br />The memories of that [[Kitsune Saiguu|foxy-eyed woman]] who eventually disappeared without a trace...<br />That unwithering flower is the final thing to remember her by.

In the end, the difference comes down to the fact that for some,<br />Life is as eternal as this undying summer bloom,<br />But for most, it is as transient as smoke.
