{{Description|A group of Forest Rangers was patrolling the Avidya Forest. Asti and Beydim were responsible for surveying the surrounding environment. While advancing, they discovered monsters ahead and ended up getting caught in a downpour, with the rain making the ground so muddy that they were temporarily stranded.<br><br>Asti sent Beydim out to the other team of Forest Rangers with the intention of reminding them to stay vigilant. Then Asti hid in a tree until the monsters left.<br><br>Later, following Beydim, the other team of Forest Rangers successfully rendezvoused with Asti. Afterward, they quickly left the forest. However, of their number, only Beydim was soaking wet. Why was that?}}
