{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing Ripe For Trouble)
:'''Tisoc:''' Ah, looks like the [[Mountain King Flamegranate]]s have finally ripened up. What a relief!
:'''Tisoc:''' Oh, it's you two! What's up? If you're planning on going in, be quick about it. Don't let anyone from the tribe see you!
:{{DIcon}} About the Mountain King...
::'''Tisoc:''' Oh, you want to hear more about the Mountain King?
::'''Tisoc:''' The Mountain King [[Kongamato]] is an extraordinary Saurian who once fought the Abyss, side-by-side with a legendary hero. Thus, he has the tribe's unanimous respect.
::'''Tisoc:''' There are people whose job it is to pick and offer up these [[Flamegranate]]s for the Mountain King's consumption. However, some say that in secret, other [[Yumkasaur]]s bring them to the Mountain King too...
::'''Tisoc:''' Which is why the Mountain King is so much more, uhh... "Robustly built," shall we say?
:{{DIcon}} About the Flamegranates...
::'''Tisoc:''' Well, you've certainly come to the right person. Flamegranates are [[phlogiston]] plants, and truly remarkable ones at that. The courage it must take for a plant to extend its roots down into liquid phlogiston... simply boggles the mind.
::'''Tisoc:''' And the fruit they produce is full of phlogiston, so they make great food for Yumkasaurs... As long as they don't chuck them around, that is...
::'''Tisoc:''' They do tend to explode on heavy impact, after all...
:{{DIcon}} Just passing through...
::'''Tisoc:''' Oh, is that so? Sure you don't want to go in and take a look at the Mountain King Flamegranates... even just a little peek? I always feel much better after taking a good, long look at them... so if you ever feel troubled, I'd recommend you do the same.
