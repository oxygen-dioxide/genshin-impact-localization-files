'''Armory Officer Miyazaki''' was a historical figure in [[Inazuma]] who lived roughly 500 years ago. He was part of [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]]'s entourage at [[Tatarasuna]].

==Profile==
Miyazaki was the Armory Officer of Tatarasuna when Mikoshi Nagamasa was its Inspector, and taught Nagamasa about the intricacies of steelwork and bladesmithing.<ref name="katsukiri">{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref> He was mentioned to have discussed bladesmithing with [[Katsuragi]], Nagamasa's yoriki, and was later present when Nagamasa forged the Daitatara Nagamasa &mdash; the blade that would later become known as the [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]].<ref name="RAN">Interactable: [[Rather Aged Notes#Dialogue|Rather Aged Notes]]</ref>

Miyazaki penned [[Rather Aged Notes#Rather Aged Notes #6|Rather Aged Notes #6]], remarking on his mixed feelings about Nagamasa, who slew Katsuragi and indirectly caused [[Nozomu]]'s death. In the note, he also indicates that [[Kinjiro]] placed the forging blueprint for Katsuragikiri Nagamasa in [[The Arsenal]].

==Trivia==
*The NPC [[Miyazaki Saburou]] is likely a descendant of Miyazaki's, or at least shares the same lineage. This also likely makes Miyazaki a practitioner of the Miyazaki Art, one of the swordsmithing traditions in Tatarasuna and the one which Saburou practices.
