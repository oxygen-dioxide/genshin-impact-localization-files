==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Pumpu first appeared alongside [[Nusta]] and her tribespeople at "Outdoor Rescue" site during the {{Quest|The Surging Darkness}}. 

He was the first [[Scions of the Canopy]] messenger who informed the Traveler about his tribespeople travelling around Natlan to distribute battle reports. He advised the Traveler to ask them about the latest battle situation if required.

His last appearance was seen laying dead on the ground beside his pouch at "Flowers of Darkness" site, the place where Traveler and Paimon first encountered the [[Abyss Tumor]] during the Abyss invasion. He was the last messenger from his tribe whom Traveler received "Battlefield Intel" report, before heading towards the [[Children of Echoes]] battlefield area for the last time.
