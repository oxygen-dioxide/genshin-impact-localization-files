# Go to the trial site and talk to [[Inkanak]]
# Seal the spouts (0/3)
# Go to the top of the mountain
# Get on the hot air balloon
#* The player will be teleported into the Quest Domain [[Tepal's "Airborne Workshop"]]
# Talk to [[Chasca]]

==Gameplay Notes==

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So [[Allpa]] says that Tepal's from the Children of Echoes. But how do we track him down? Just... ask around until we find him?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Let's start by talking to someone we know. It'll be faster that way. At this time and place, I'll bet the easiest person to find is:
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Wakey-wakey, Xilonen.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' *yawn* Ah, it's you... Ugh, okay... Give me a second, I'll come down...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' *yawn*...
:{{DIcon}} Seems like you two both love climbing trees...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I climb trees to fly further and see farther. I don't usually stop for a nap.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, we're not all like you &mdash; always full of energy, even after flying around all day... So. You've come all this way and interrupted my precious nap time. Might I inquire as to why?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I'm sorry, Xilonen, but it couldn't wait. Does the name "Tepal" mean anything to you? He's a craftsman, apparently.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Tepal? Yes, that rings a bell... I think that's [[Puma]]'s child.
:{{DIcon}} Is he in the tribe right now?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Nope, I'm afraid you're a few years too late... Why are you looking for him?
:{{DIcon}} It's a long story...
:{{Black Screen|You try to explain what happened simply and briefly...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' "Phlogiston Wings"? Wow, okay. The kid actually pulled it off... Well, looks like no more rest for me today.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pulled it off? You mean he's tried making something like this before?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Yeah, he started trying to build a flying machine right after he got back from the Flower-Feather Clan.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' So right after he went wingless, then... Was this flying machine anything like the gun you made me?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You mean, your gun that's harder to tame than the proudest [[qucusaur]]? No, he wanted to build something that allows anyone to fly freely, even if they're not naturally gifted.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But... he never got very far back then, though. Blew up his workshop a few times and barely made it out alive. I never really kept up with him after that.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' His parents traveled a lot in their youth, and only returned to the tribe after he was born. But they settled in a remote area, and don't interact with other people much.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Which means, most people in the tribe don't know them very well... Your best bet is to chat to his direct family.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 1 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'll go get Puma. Wait for me in front of the workshop, I won't be long.

;(Approach Xilonen's workshop)
:{{Black Screen|A short while later, at Xilonen's workshop...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'm back. Allow me to introduce Tepal's mother, Puma.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello! We're&mdash;
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 puma 01.ogg}} '''Puma:''' Save the pleasantries. I don't want to spend any longer talking about that boy than I have to.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 puma 02.ogg}} '''Puma:''' I disowned him long ago... He is no child of mine!
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 puma 03.ogg}} '''Puma:''' All he cared about was his pipe dream of reaching the sky... We tried to talk sense into him, but he was obsessed!
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 puma 04.ogg}} '''Puma:''' Hmph... Then when he left us, he spouted some nonsense about building a workshop in the sky to avoid the constant criticism of us ground-dwellers...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 puma 05.ogg}} '''Puma:''' He left his notebook behind. Whatever questions you have, you can look for them in there &mdash; I'm done talking about him.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 puma 06.ogg}} '''Puma:''' He is no son of mine... He never called me "Mom" anyway...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, they've really fallen out... Paimon sure wasn't expecting that...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Her husband, Tepal's father... he passed away recently, and Tepal didn't even bother to show his face at the funeral.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' If you ask me, that was probably the final straw for Puma.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'll go keep her company. If there's anything else you need, just come and find me.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Thank you.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so this notebook is the only lead we've got now, right? What's in there?

:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hmm... some early designs for the Phlogiston Wings... and some theorizing about an airborne workshop.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Ochkanatlan, the Cinder City... Looks like that's where he got his technological inspiration from.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So he was serious about the workshop in the sky? But that's such a big project for one person... do we think he actually pulled it off?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, look at that balloon sketch...
:{{DIcon}} Haven't we seen that somewhere before?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Oh! Yes! The one from the trial arena that was super high up!
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' That balloon has been there for a while, and everyone's been wondering how it got up there. But... what if that's the wrong question?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' What if it started off even higher up, above the clouds and out of view, and it only descended to its current height due to some kind of malfunction?
:{{DIcon}} In other words, it could be...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Part of Tepal's workshop?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Seems likely. If Tepal's base had been hiding above the clouds this whole time, that would definitely explain why [[Isidore]] couldn't find it...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon totally called it... But um, how do we get up there? Chasca, can you even fly that high?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' By myself... possibly. But with a passenger, no chance.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I doubt even Phlogiston Wings could take you up that high... at least, not without that "relic" Tepal mentioned in his notebook.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, and he's probably holding onto it... We'll have to find another way.
:{{DIcon}} Can you fly up that high, Paimon?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, that's waaay beyond Paimon's altitude! Also, would you really expect Paimon to go up there and take on Tepal all by herself?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Let's not worry. Just because we can't think of a solution doesn't mean no one else can. I'm not the only flying expert in my tribe, you know.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good point. We should go ask Elder Allpa!
:{{A|vo qsklq004 2 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' And [[Mutota]]. He was quite the flying ace back in the day, too. Let's head back and see what they suggest.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Tepal's Tattered Notes}})

;(Talk to Xilonen, optional)
:{{A|vo qsklq004 3 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hmm? How's the sleuthing going?
:{{DIcon}} We're good for now. How is Puma doing?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 3 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hanging in there &mdash; she seems to have calmed down now. I'll check in with her again later.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 3 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I think something about handing you that notebook meant she was finally able to let go of a few things. So maybe this was for the best.

;(Near Mutota)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} {{A|vo qsklq004 4 huascar 01.ogg}} '''Huascar:''' We want Phlogiston Wings...
:{{DIcon|Idle}} {{A|vo qsklq004 4 pachacuti 01.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' Have you gone mad...
:{{DIcon|Idle}} {{A|vo qsklq004 4 coyllur 01.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' Although I get where they're coming from...
:{{DIcon|Idle}} {{A|vo qsklq004 4 zhunan 01.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' But without the Phlogiston Wings...

;(Talk to Huascar or Mukki, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq004 huascar 01.ogg}} '''Huascar:''' No more qucusaurs! We want Phlogiston Wings!
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq004 pachacuti 01.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' Have you gone mad? The qucusaurs are our partners!

;(Talk to Coyllur or Zhunan, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq004 coyllur 01.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' Although I get where they're coming from, isn't bad-mouthing the qucusaurs going a step too far?
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq004 zhunan 01.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' But without the Phlogiston Wings, I'll never make it...
----
;(Talk to Mutota or Allpa)
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Chasca, you're finally back! Things are getting really tense in the tribe. Have you made any headway with your investigation?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Some people think we arrested the merchants just to support the flying squad and crack down on the Phlogiston Wings.
:{{DIcon}} If things are still escalating even though we've rounded up the merchants...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe there are other parties out there fanning the flames too?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We've found some promising leads, but there's a major obstacle standing between us and the irrefutable evidence we need...
:{{Black Screen|Chasca explains what you found out about Tepal, and your theory about the airborne workshop...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 02.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' A relic from the Cinder City? Ugh... so [[Och-Kan]]'s still managing to sow discord, even after all these years...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 allpa 02.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' An airborne workshop... and a hot air balloon above the trial arena... And that's where you're trying to get to now?
:{{DIcon}} Any ideas how we can get up there?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 allpa 03.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Neither Phlogiston Wings nor a qucusaur can take you that high up. Do you really think that's where Tepal is hiding?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 03.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Hmm... You know what... There might just be a way.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really!?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 04.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Do you still remember those spouts in the arena? When they were all blocked, the [[Gaseous Phlogiston|gaseous phlogiston]] was trapped and unable to flow.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 05.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' But now, it's flowing freely. If we were to block them up again...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You mean... All of them except the one at the very top of the arena? To build up the pressure there?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 06.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Precisely. With all the gaseous phlogiston flowing through one spout, it would create a high-pressure wind current...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And then we just ride it up into the sky.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 07.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Yes. It has its risks, but with Chasca's abilities, I think she could manage it...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 allpa 04.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' It's an extremely risky approach... but I agree that it's feasible.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 08.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' If you want to give it a try, check with Inkanak at the trial grounds. She can explain how to block the spouts.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 5 mutota 09.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Chasca... If anyone has a hope of seizing this evidence from the high heavens, it is you.

;(Talk to Allpa or Mutota, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq004 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' We'll do our best to manage the conflict within the tribe while you're gone. Hopefully it'll buy you some time.
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq004 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Chief, we should put a defense plan in place... just in case.
----
;(Talk to Inkanak)
:{{Black Screen|You hurry to the trial arena and explain the situation to Inkanak...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 inkanak 01.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Goodness me... That is a very bold idea...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Maybe so, but we have to act fast. What's the quickest way for us to block off the spouts?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 inkanak 02.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' From a technical perspective, I'd have to advise taking some measurements and carefully planning this out first... But I'm guessing that's not what you want to hear?
:{{DIcon}} Right.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 inkanak 03.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' ...Then we'll have to take the rough-and-ready approach. See the [[Phlogiston|solid phlogiston]] over there?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 inkanak 04.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Our prior inspections revealed that some kind of stable structure has formed inside, making it highly damage-resistant...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 inkanak 05.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' It's not without its weak points, but unless they're all struck at the same time, the structural integrity won't be threatened...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... what happens if we do strike them all at once?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 inkanak 06.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' It'll collapse.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Okay, I see where you're going with this.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 inkanak 07.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Yeah, you got it! As long as you hit all the weak spots at once from the right angle, the solid phlogiston will fall right on top of the spout, and block it up.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 7 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You're right about "rough and ready"... Sounds like my kind of plan.

;(Talk to Inkanak again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq004 inkanak 01.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' As long as you hit all the weak spots at once from the right angle, the solid phlogiston will fall right on top of the spout, and block it up.

;(Approach a vent)
:{{A|vo qsklq004 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look! There's a chunk of solid phlogiston right over that spout!

;(Approach the top of the mountain)
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It actually worked... But wait, how are Paimon and {{Traveler}} supposed to get up there?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Coya can give you a lift. She's actually been following us this whole time.
:'''Coya:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... Paimon didn't notice at all!
:{{DIcon}} Why didn't she come and join us?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Probably because she didn't want to get too close to humans... Or maybe just me. But right now, we need her power.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 coya 02.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! You didn't even have to summon her...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 coya 03.ogg}} '''Coya:''' ...Cheep.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yes, up there... That's probably where [[Chime]] is.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 10 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Alright. Let's go have a little talk with this Tepal.

;(Approach the balloon)
:{{A|vo qsklq004 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... Oof... Paimon's never flown that fast before... She feels ready to throw up...
:{{DIcon}} At least we made it in one piece.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 11 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Ah-hah... just as I thought. It might look like a regular hot air balloon from the outside, but up close, it's clearly been heavily remodeled.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 11 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' And sure enough, it only descended below the cloud line because the custom-built machinery malfunctioned.
:{{DIcon}} Can you tell what the issue is?
:{{A|vo qsklq004 11 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I should be able to figure it out, with Tepal's notebook. Thankfully, I know a little DIY from fixing up my guns when they're having issues.
:{{A|vo qsklq004 11 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Mm-hmm... That should just about do it. Now all it needs is a nice, hard kick...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Maybe that works on your guns, but...
:{{A|vo qsklq004 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? We're really moving!
