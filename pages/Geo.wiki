'''Geo''' is one of the seven [[Elements]] and the second one the [[Traveler]] acquires.

Its associated [[Archon]] is [[Morax]], whose domain is [[Liyue]].

==Elemental Resonance==
Having two Geo characters in the group results in the [[Elemental Resonance]]:
*'''Enduring Rock:''' Increases shield strength by 15%. Additionally, characters protected by a shield will have the following special characteristics: DMG dealt increased by 15%, dealing DMG to enemies will decrease their Geo RES by 20% for 15s.

==Elemental Reactions==
{{Geo}} has [[Elemental Reactions]] with the elements [[Electro]], [[Pyro]], [[Hydro]] and [[Cryo]]. In all cases the reaction is Crystallize.

*'''[[Crystallize]]:''' Creates a shard of the involved element. Picking it up creates a shield of that element around the character.

==Geo Status==
[[File:Zhongli Burst Geo Demonstration.png|thumb|120px|An applied Geo status effect on a [[Wooden Shieldwall Mitachurl]] caused by [[Zhongli]]'s Elemental Burst [[Planet Befall]]. Geo will not normally show up as a status effect on an enemy if there is no other element pre-applied to it.]]
Similar to {{Anemo}}, {{Geo}} is ephemeral and will either react immediately with preapplied elements or disappear instantly after application if no other elements are applied when applied to an enemy. However, {{Enemy|Geo Hypostasis}} as well as {{Enemy|Stonehide Lawachurl}} and {{Enemy|Large Geo Slime}} whilst their shields are active have a perpetual {{Geo}} status applied to them, but it cannot react with other elements to trigger Crystallize.

Another exception exists: [[Zhongli]]'s Elemental Burst, [[Planet Befall]], is capable of applying a persistent {{Geo}} status effect for the duration of his Petrification.

==Enemies==
Some [[Enemies]] are capable of generating a Geo shield or constructs, providing them with significant offensive or defensive abilities. The shields and constructs that are breakable are often best broken with [[Blunt Attack]]s, such as [[Claymore]] attacks.
