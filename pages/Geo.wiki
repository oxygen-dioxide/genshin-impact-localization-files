'''Geo''' is one of the seven [[Elements]].

Its associated [[Archon]] is [[Morax]], whose domain is [[Liyue]].

==Elemental Resonance==
Having two Geo characters in the group results in the [[Elemental Resonance]]:
*'''Enduring Rock:''' Increases shield strength by 15%. Additionally, characters protected by a shield will have the following special characteristics: DMG dealt increased by 15%, dealing DMG to enemies will decrease their Geo RES by 20% for 15s.

==Elemental Reactions==
{{Geo}} has [[Elemental Reactions]] with the elements [[Electro]], [[Pyro]], [[Hydro]] and [[Cryo]]. In all cases the reaction is Crystallize.

*'''[[Crystallize]]:''' Creates a shard of the involved element. Picking it up creates a shield of that element around the character.

==Geo Status==
[[File:Zhongli Burst Geo Demonstration.png|thumb|120px|Geo Status applied by Zhongli's Planet Befall]]
Similar to {{Anemo}}, the {{Geo}} status cannot be applied using elemental attacks. However, {{Enemy|Geo Hypostasis}} as well as {{Enemy|Stonehide Lawachurl}} and {{Enemy|Large Geo Slime}} whilst their shields are active have a perpetual {{Geo}} status applied to them, but it cannot react with other elements to trigger Crystallize.

Another exception exists: [[Zhongli]]'s Elemental Burst, [[Planet Befall]], is capable of applying a persistent {{Geo}} status effect for the duration of his Petrification. This Geo status has the following properties:
* The Geo gauge has '''0.04''' [[gauge unit]]s.
* The Geo gauge does not decay over time. When the petrified state ends, the status is fully removed.
* Does not react with other elements.

==Trivia==
* In ''Genshin Impact''{{'}}s story, {{Geo}} is likely the second element that the Traveler resonates with, and they are shown using both Anemo and Geo in a cinematic cutscene in ''[[Heart of Glaze]]'' during [[Chapter I]] of the [[Archon Quest]]s.
** In ''Genshin Impact''{{'}}s gameplay, players are never forced to resonate their [[Traveler]] characters with or to even unlock any [[Statues of The Seven]] in [[Liyue]]. It is therefore possible to play the entire game thus far<!-- as of Version 3.1 --> without ever resonating the Traveler character with Geo or even unlocking any Statues of The Seven in Liyue.

===Etymology===
* The name Geo comes from the prefix for words related to the Earth, "{{wt|geo-||English}}," which derives from {{lang|the Ancient Greek word for earth|grc=γῆ|grc_rm=gê}}.
