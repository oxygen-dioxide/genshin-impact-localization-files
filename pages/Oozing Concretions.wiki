'''Oozing Concretions''' are found in the [[The Chasm/Underground Mines|Underground Mines]] of [[The Chasm]]. They are sometimes found in [[Dark Mud]], which they maintain. There are different Levels of Oozing Concretions that require [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]]s of sufficient power for their Blooming Light to destroy them.
