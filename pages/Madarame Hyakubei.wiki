:'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' It's you. Welcome back. The Yashiro Commission has received a lot of requests recently. Could you take a look at them?
;(Reputation Level 7)

:{{DIcon|Reputation}} How's my reputation in Inazuma?

::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' About that... if you could help finish some work here, everyone in Inazuma would really appreciate it.
:;(Reputation Level 3)
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' You have helped a lot of people through your work! We'll be counting on you in the future as well. Much obliged.

::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' You do good work! It's no wonder you are a trusted friend of Miss Kamisato. I'd wager these tasks are just small beans to you.

:{{DIcon}} About yourself...
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' I am Madarame Hyakubei, an advisor who reports to Commissioner Kamisato of the Yashiro Commission.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' The Commissioner is very busy at the moment, so you may talk to me if it is not something urgent.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Feel free to ask for help if you need anything. You are a respected guest of the [[Kamisato Clan]], and I shall do my utmost to help you.
:{{DIcon}} About the Yashiro Commission...
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' The Yashiro Commission, the [[Kanjou Commission]], and the [[Tenryou Commission]] are known as the "[[Tri-Commission]]." The Yashiro Commission is different from the other two commissions. It's responsible for cultural affairs in Inazuma, like offerings to shrines, ceremonial affairs, publishing books, and so on.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Because of that, we often hear the various wishes of the people of Inazuma...
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Miss Kamisato is a very kind lady. She has persuaded the Commissioner to allocate funds and resources to help grant the peoples' wishes.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' But since the requests concern many different aspects of life here, we usually have a shortage of manpower when things get busy...
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Now that I mention it, would you be interested in helping us out? You will be paid fairly, of course. Once you have more experienced and a better reputation, you will receive more important and better-paying commissions.
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you then.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Okay, on your way, then.
