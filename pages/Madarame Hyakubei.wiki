{{Quote
|Madarame is a member of the [[Yashiro Commission]]. Due to the nature of the Commission itself and the disposition of [[Kamisato Ayaka|its Princess]], he is quite well acquainted with the weals and woes of Inazuma's people. Madarame Hyakubei is also charged with helping the people solve various problems. If you help these people out and raise your reputation amongst them, you may obtain [[Reputation#Inazuma|some precious items]] from Madarame...

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Reputation Level 1–2)
:'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Hello, what is your business in the [[Yashiro Commission]]?
;(Reputation Level 3)
:'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' It's you. Welcome back. The Yashiro Commission has received a lot of requests recently. Could you take a look at them?
;(Reputation Level 7)
:'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Hello, it's been a while! Every time you come, it means that a lot of our headaches will soon disappear. Thank you very much for that.
:{{DIcon|Reputation}} How's my reputation in Inazuma?
:;(Reputation Level 1-2)
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' About that... if you could help finish some work here, everyone in Inazuma would really appreciate it,
:;(Reputation Level 3)
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' You have helped a lot of people through your work! We'll be counting on you in the future as well. Much obliged.
:;(Reputation Level 7)
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' You do good work! It's no wonder you are a trusted friend of [[Kamisato Ayaka|Miss Kamisato]]. I'd wager these tasks are just small beans to you.
:;(Opens Inazuma Reputation menu)
:{{DIcon}} About yourself...
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' I am Madarame Hyakubei, an advisor who reports to [[Kamisato Ayato|Commissioner Kamisato]] of the Yashiro Commission.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' The Commissioner is very busy at the moment, so you may talk to me if it is not something urgent.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Feel free to ask for help if you need anything. You are a respected guest of the [[Kamisato Clan]], and I shall do my utmost to help you.
:{{DIcon}} About the Yashiro Commission...
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' The Yashiro Commission, the [[Kanjou Commission]], and the [[Tenryou Commission]] are known as the "[[Tri-Commission]]." The Yashiro Commission is different from the other two commissions. It's responsible for cultural affairs in Inazuma, like offerings to shrines, ceremonial affairs, publishing books, and so on.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Because of that, we often hear the various wishes of the people of Inazuma...
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Miss Kamisato is a very kind lady. She has persuaded the Commissioner to allocate funds and resources to help grant the peoples' wishes.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' But since the requests concern many different aspects of life here, we usually have a shortage of manpower when things get busy...
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Now that I mention it, would you be interested in helping us out? You will be paid fairly, of course. Once you have more experienced and a better reputation, you will receive more important and better-paying commissions.
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you then.
::'''Madarame Hyakubei:''' Okay, on your way, then.
