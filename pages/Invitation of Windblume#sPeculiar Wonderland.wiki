'''Peculiar Wonderland''' is an [[Event Domain]] located near [[Whispering Woods]] in [[Mondstadt]]. Clearing this domain gives [[Peculiar Collab Coupon]] which can be used to buy items in the event shop.

This domain can be found under [[File:Icon Peculiar Wonderland.svg|20x20px]] icon.

==Requirements==
* Complete ''[[Peculiar Wonderland (Quest)|Peculiar Wonderland]]''

==Description==
An ever-changing Domain of enigmatic composition and rarely seen challenges, known in adventurers' tales as the "Peculiar Wonderland"!<br />
Each time you enter the "Peculiar Wonderland," you will face three special, random "Peculiar Challenges," and based on how much Facundity you accumulate during these challenges, you will obtain all manner of blessings that will boost your strength during the "Peculiar Trial" at the very end of the Wonderland.

==Peculiar Challenges==
Despite the selection of Peculiar Challenges appearing to be randomized, there is actually a fixed group of challenges corresponding to the order of the first, second, and third challenges from which a challenge is chosen. These fixed groups change at different phases of the event.

To save time on attempts to complete various missions in the Peculiar Conqueror phases, it's faster to complete the missions that involve challenges appearing in the first challenge slot (or else it would take extra time to complete the first and second challenges just to have a random chance of playing the desired challenge out of the fixed possibilities in the third challenge slot).

For example, in the second phase of the event, there is a mission that requires avoiding all the bubbles in "The Great Bubble Crash" challenge. But during the second phase, "The Great Bubble Crash" will only have a chance to appear as the third/last challenge in each domain attempt, thus requiring completion of the first and second challenges just to possibly play "The Great Bubble Crash" in the third challenge or restart if the third challenge ends up being "Bubble Speedster" instead. However, in the third phase of the event, "The Great Bubble Crash" is in the first challenge slot, making it much faster and more time efficient to attempt the mission during this phase with the ability to restart right away until the desired challenge is randomly chosen from the fixed pool.

The 2nd bonus is also based on the current Invitation of Windblume event phase but does not change on each run.
