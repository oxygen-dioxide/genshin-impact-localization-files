{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Charlene:''' Hello! Is there anything I can do for you?
:{{DIcon|Reward}} Feeling good?
::'''Charlene:''' Uh huh, why not? Whatever happens, happens. I don't need to worry about something that hasn't even happened yet!
::'''Charlene:''' Don't you think so? It sounds like a deep philosophy of life, right?
:;(Obtain {{Item|Hero's Wit|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, you're...
::'''Charlene:''' I'm a new member of the Gardes. Call me Charlene.
::'''Charlene:''' And if you can't remember the name, just go with "hey," "you," or "newbie," or whatever. Pleased to be at your service!
::{{DIcon}} I probably shouldn't use all those names...
::'''Charlene:''' Huh, is that a problem? I mean, the important thing is the incident details, not my title, right?
::'''Charlene:''' Besides, the less people know our names, the better!
::'''Charlene:''' A Gardes member's name only ever gets published in The Steambird when something goes wrong, anyway.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Charlene:''' See you! Hope I don't see you at the scene of a crime, alright? Hehe.
