The '''Wind Catcher''' is a reusable [[Forge]]d [[gadget]] that creates a temporary [[Wind Current]] for approximately 9 seconds. It is recharged by stepping over an [[Anemograna]], and up to five charges can be held at once. Using the gadget puts it on a 100-second cooldown.

The [[Diagram: Wind Catcher|diagram]] can be obtained by reaching [[Reputation]] Level 3 in [[Mondstadt]].

==Notes==
* A good place to find Anemograna is just southwest of [[Windrise]].
* The mutated Anemograna found in Dragonspine will also charge the Wind Catcher. There is no change in the Wind Current created.
* The Wind Catcher cannot be used during combat.
* While the Wind Catcher can be used in another player's world and charges will be consumed normally, it cannot be recharged until the player returns to their own world.
* Creating a Wind Current via a Wind Catcher will not apply [[Anemo]], so it cannot be used to collect [[Dandelion Seed]]s or fulfill "using the power of Anemo" steps in certain quests and Commissions.
