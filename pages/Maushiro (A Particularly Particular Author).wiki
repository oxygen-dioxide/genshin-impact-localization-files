'''Maushiro''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|A Particularly Particular Author}}. However, when the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] return to [[Narukami Island]], they "lose" the Maushiro and it is silently removed from the player's [[Inventory]].

==Trivia==
* The name "Maushiro" is based on {{Lang|mini=1|ain=マゥシロ|ain_rm=mawsiro}}, the {{w|Ainu language|Ainu}} word for "whistling."
* This item is based on the {{W|Mukkuri}}, a traditional Ainu mouth harp made of bamboo.
