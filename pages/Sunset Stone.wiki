|description    = It is recorded in the "[[Seven Mountain Treatises]]" that [[Tianqiu Valley]] was once home to a mysterious kind of stone that would absorb the rosy hue of sunset after basking in it evening after evening over a long period. It became known as "Sunset Stone." However, the claim has never been proven. Today, this term is used generally to refer to all manner of brown-colored stones.
