:'''Sinchi:''' Hello. Is there anything I can bring back for you?
:{{DIcon}} How about relatives?
::'''Sinchi:''' ...You misunderstood me. I'm just a regular hunter.
::'''Sinchi:''' If you're looking for someone, you should probably hire a private detective, or file a commission with the [[Adventurers' Guild]]... I'm honestly not too sure either.
::'''Sinchi:''' The only thing I know how to do is go on hunts with my [[Yumkasaurus]] partner. As long as you give me a target, I'll be able to bring it back for you.
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine, thanks.
::'''Sinchi:''' Oh.
