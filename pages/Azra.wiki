:'''Azra:''' When will I be able to see [[Nilou]] perform again?
:{{DIcon}} About Nilou...
::'''Azra:''' Let me tell you, [[Zubayr Theater]]'s Nilou is the best dancer ever.
::'''Azra:''' Many may be able to dance beautifully, but Nilou is unique in the way she infuses emotions into her dance.
::'''Azra:''' It took me a long time to snap out of such a feeling after watching her performance. It's so...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} That feeling?
:::'''Azra:''' Just like water!
:::'''Azra:''' I mean, pure water can be shaped into different forms, boiled, or frozen...
:::'''Azra:''' *sigh* If I weren't assigned as a guard here, I would like to watch her perform every day.
::; (Obtain [[Varunada Lazurite Fragment]] ×1)
;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Azra:''' *sigh* Why doesn't the Akademiya like theaters?
;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)

::'''Azra:''' The ban on the arts has been lifted, so we should be able to watch more performances now...
