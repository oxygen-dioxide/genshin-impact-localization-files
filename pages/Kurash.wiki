==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kurash:''' Oh, looks like you're a tourist here?
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Kurash:''' I'm Kurash, I'm not from here, either.
::'''Kurash:''' I gained quite a few skills while living in the desert, and I planned to join [[the Eremites]].
::'''Kurash:''' But just thinking about running around for my employers gives me a headache... It's better to just find a village and live a life that's fulfilling and leisurely.
::'''Kurash:''' Look, even [[Jehiet|Granny Jehiet]] chose to retire here!
::{{DIcon}} Granny Jehiet...
::'''Kurash:''' Speaking of her, I was shocked when I met her for the first time!
::'''Kurash:''' Appearances do change over time, but I'm certain Granny Jehiet is "The Lioness" in the legend!
::'''Kurash:''' I didn't expect her to be living here... and even adopt a little boy.
::'''Kurash:''' It's so unbelievable, I mean, she is "The Lioness" after all...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kurash:''' See you, I hope you'll get to relax here for some time too.
