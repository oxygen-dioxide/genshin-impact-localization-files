::{{DIcon}} You're...
:::'''Elphane:''' I'm Elphane, the guide for this trip.
:::{{DIcon}} I'd like to ask about...
:::'''Elphane:''' Melusines are a young race born in Fontaine. There are many differences between us and humanity.
:::{{DIcon}} Is there anything else about Melusines...
:::'''Elphane:''' We do have one secret we can share with you, passenger.
:::'''Elphane:''' We are similar to humans in one way. Each of us has a different personality. Some of us like chatting. Some don't.
::{{DIcon|Gear}} When does the...
:::'''Elphane:''' Immediately.
::{{DIcon}} See you.

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available immediately upon arriving at Marcotte Station.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Elphane:''' Hello.
:{{DIcon}} This aquabus is really...
::'''Elphane:''' "The Court Region Waterway Hub and the [[Fontaine Research Institute|Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering]] are working to improve aquabus speed."
::{{DIcon}} I was going to say that it was "really beautiful."
:::'''Elphane:''' I'm glad you think so.
::{{DIcon}} But you haven't heard what I think of its speed yet...
:::'''Elphane:''' Dear passenger. Previous feedback data indicates that you will either find it too fast or too slow. The official response to either is the same.
:::'''Elphane:''' Of course, if you think that its speed is "really perfect," then good. Thank you, on behalf of the Court Region Waterway Hub and the aquabus itself.
:::{{DIcon}} Are you in a bad mood, Ms. Elphane?
:::'''Elphane:''' No. I simply...
:::'''Elphane:''' ...Sorry.
:::'''Elphane:''' Hmm... I'll be frank. If you wish to experience the joys of an aquabus, I personally recommend that you ride the Clementine Line, for which [[Aeval]] is the guide.
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about Erinnyes?
::'''Elphane:''' Recommended areas of visitation are the Fountain of Lucine and Opera Epiclese. Other than that, I do not recommend anything. Institute's ruins comprise the northern part of Erinnyes...
::{{DIcon}} Well, I'm an adventurer, so...
:::'''Elphane:''' You misunderstand. That area is indeed dangerous, and does also play host to out-of-control [[Clockwork Meka|clockwork meka]].
:::'''Elphane:''' However, the most potent threat present at the moment is the Institute Technicians. They can drone on for an entire day without giving you any information or expressing any perspective. Truly ghastly.
::{{DIcon}} Is there anything else?
::'''Elphane:''' Do not go to Erinnyes's depths.
::{{DIcon}} Why not?
::'''Elphane:''' I apologize, but I do not know, either. This was Monsieur [[Neuvillette]]'s suggestion, and I trust his wisdom.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Elphane:''' See you.

:{{DIcon}} So...
::{{DIcon}} So, where are we...
:::'''Elphane:''' This aquabus is bound for the Court of Fontaine, the birthplace of [[The Steambird]]. Feel free to subscribe to it.
::{{DIcon}} So, what is this...
:::'''Elphane:''' Welcome aboard the Navia Line. This aquabus is bound for the Court of Fontaine, the birthplace of The Steambird. Feel free to subscribe to it.
::{{DIcon}} You're...
:::'''Elphane:''' I'm Elphane, the guide for this trip.
:::{{DIcon}} What I wanted to say was...
::::{{DIcon}} Looking real cute today, Ms. Elphane!
:::::'''Elphane:''' What!?
:::::'''Elphane:''' P&mdash;Please refrain from jokes in such poor taste, dear passenger!
::::{{DIcon}} How many times faster would the aquabus be with you at the helm?
:::::'''Elphane:''' Aquabus engine outputs cannot be changed by the identity of the driver.
::{{DIcon|Gear}} When does the...
:::'''Elphane:''' Immediately.
::{{DIcon}} See you.

:{{DIcon}} See you.

===Dialogue Set #4===
''Available immediately upon arriving at Court Region Waterway Hub.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Elphane:''' Hello.
:{{DIcon}} This trip.
::{{DIcon}} That was a real memorable trip!
:::'''Elphane:''' That's great. Please allow me to thank you on behalf of the Court Region Waterway Hub and the aquabus itself for your praise.
::{{DIcon}} It was faster than the Clementine Line, anyway...
:::'''Elphane:''' Objectively speaking, the Navia Line is shorter. As such &mdash; aquabus speeds being equal &mdash; your senses match reality.
:::{{DIcon}} But...
::::{{DIcon}} The scenery was pretty good.
:::::'''Elphane:''' Very good.
::::{{DIcon}} Your explanation was very good, Ms. Elphane.
:::::'''Elphane:''' What!?
:::::'''Elphane:''' P&mdash;Please refrain from jokes in such poor taste, dear passenger!
:::::'''Elphane:''' *cough* If you like listening to explanations, I personally recommend that you ride the Clementine Line, for which Aeval serves as a guide.
::::{{DIcon}} That was way too slow.
:::::'''Elphane:''' "The Court Region Waterway Hub and the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering are working to improve aquabus speed."
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Court of Fontaine...
::'''Elphane:''' A natural point of interest is The Steambird. As for the reason it's recommended... This is what was written &mdash; "Whatever, just find a way to recommend it."
::{{DIcon}} Sure, sure. Any personal recommendations?
::'''Elphane:''' Yes. First, [[Bertin's House of Curiosities]] and [[Chioriya Boutique]]. Both of them sell very... cute clothes. They even have gloves custom-fit for Melusines. Not that I'm interested or anything!
::'''Elphane:''' Otherwise, my friends and I often go to [[Café Lutece]]. The smell of coffee is just too good &mdash; even better than [[Emilie]]'s perfume.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Elphane:''' See you.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Given that Melusines are named after fairy figures in real-life mythologies, "Elphane" may be based on the {{W|Queen of Elphame}}, the queen of fairies in Scottish folklore.
** The word "Elphame" itself may be derived from {{W|Álfheimr}}, the legendary abode of elves in Norse mythology.
