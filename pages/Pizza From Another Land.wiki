{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kiminami Anna)
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' *sigh* What am I to do...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Traveler? Great, you have perfect timing!
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Do you remember the recipe you wrote for me the last time, when you and Ms. Kamisato came to my store?
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Oh, that pizza was so popular that many customers came to the store to order it specially.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' But... some customers also said that they were bored of eating this pizza all the time and asked if I have other pizza flavors.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Although I have tried several methods to make new types of pizza based on feedback from customers...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' But I always feel... that something is lacking, and the response from customers is not very good.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' *sigh* Maybe I'm really not good at making pizza...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Traveler, you know a lot about this dish, right? Can you give me some advice?
:{{DIcon}} You got it!
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Great! By the way, I've also collected feedback from customers. Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
:{{DIcon}} About the customers' feedback...
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Do you want to take a look at the customer feedback?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
;(If Mondstadt ingredients were mostly used in [[Food From Afar]])
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Miss Rie said that although the taste of this pizza is not bad...
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' But she felt that the pizza would taste better if it incorporated some of Inazuma's local ingredients.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I wonder what ingredients she would like to see... Traveler, please help me ask her.
::;(Go to [[#Lavender Melon Version 2|Lavender Melon Version]])
;(If Inazuman ingredients were mostly used in [[Food From Afar]])
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Miss Matsumoto said that although the pizza in my shop incorporates a lot of ingredients from Inazuma, she heard that Mondstadt pizza is not made like this.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' She said that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain {{sic|it's|hide=1}} authentic flavor...
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' *sigh* But how am I going to know how to make Mondstadt's pizza? Traveler, please help me ask her.
::;(Go to [[#Cheese Version 2|Cheese Version]])
;(Talk to Kiminami Anna again)
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' *sigh* Maybe I'm really not good at making pizza...

===Lavender Melon Version===

;(Talk to Rie)
:'''Rie:''' Oh, hello. Can I help you with something?
:{{DIcon}} About Kiminami Restaurant's pizza...
:'''Rie:''' Oh, that pizza tastes really good.
:'''Rie:''' But... how do I put this, I'm not very used to its flavor.
:'''Rie:''' I just think that if you can mix some of Inazuma's local ingredients into the pizza, such as Lavender Melon...
:'''Rie:''' Maybe, the pizza will be more popular with everyone.

;(Talk to Rie again)
:'''Rie:''' Pizza made with Lavender Melon... I wonder how it tastes...
----
;(Talk to Kiminami Anna)
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Traveler, you've returned.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' How did it go, any feedback?
:{{DIcon}} About the customers' feedback...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Pizza made with Lavender Melon... That's not too complicated...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' The rest of the ingredients just need to be prepared as usual. Well, since the feedback said to "incorporate some of Inazuma's local ingredients," then I can add some other ingredients...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hmm, Sea Ganoderma? Naku Weed? Oh, how about [[Fluorescent Fungus]]...
:{{DIcon}} Umm, need some help?
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Oh! I'm sorry, I was busy thinking about what ingredients to put in! Let's see, I don't think there's much Lavender Melon left in the store...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Traveler, please help me get a Lavender Melon. When it comes to ingredients... this should be all that's missing.
:{{DIcon}} I'm on it.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Mm, I'm counting on you then. Just one Lavender Melon will do.
:{{DIcon}} Do you need other ingredients?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' There are still some other ingredients in stock in the store. Just bring back a Lavender Melon, please.

;(Talk to Kiminami Anna again)
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Have you brought the ingredients back with you?
:;(Submit {{item|Lavender Melon|x=1}})
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Thank you, these ingredients will do.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' I wonder what a pizza made with Inazuma's local ingredients would taste like...
:{{Black Screen|''Kiminami Anna starts making pizza...''}}
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' It's done!
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' This pizza looks... pretty good...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, these are for you.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' I'll make sure to savor this pizza's taste...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' If it's not bad... it should be officially launched as a new dish soon.

===Cheese Version===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Matsumoto)
:'''Matsumoto:''' *sigh* Is there anything in the world that will satisfy my taste buds?
:{{DIcon}} About Kiminami Restaurant's pizza...
:'''Matsumoto:''' Oh, the pizza you mentioned tastes really good, and it also has a lot of local ingredients.
:'''Matsumoto:''' However, I have tried the authentic Mushroom Pizza before.
:'''Matsumoto:''' I remember that the pizza was made of Cheese, Cabbage, and Mushrooms...
:'''Matsumoto:''' Hahaha, I just feel that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain {{sic|it's|hide=1}} authentic flavor.

;(Talk to Matsumoto again)
:'''Matsumoto:''' The Mushroom Pizza tastes really good, you must try it if you have the chance.
----
;(Talk to Kiminami Anna)
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Traveler, you've returned.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' How did it go, any feedback?
:{{DIcon}} About the customers' feedback...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' The original Mushroom Pizza... Hmm, it's worth a try.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' The ingredients to prepare are Cheese, Cabbage, and Mushrooms...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' We have the other ingredients, but we usually don't stock up on Cheese...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Traveler, could I trouble you to get a block of Cheese?
:{{DIcon}} I'll take care of it.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I'm counting on you, then. Just a block of Cheese will do.
:{{DIcon}} You don't really use Cheese in the store?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' It's not that we don't use it at all, we just use it very rarely.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' After all, there are not many dishes in the store that require Cheese, so we don't really stock much of it...
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Anyway, I'm counting on you, Traveler. Please help to bring me a block of Cheese.
----
;(Talk to Kiminami Anna again)
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Have you brought the ingredients back with you?
:;(Submit {{item|Cheese|x=1}})
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Thank you, these ingredients will do.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' The original Mushroom Pizza from Mondstadt, I don't know if I can make it successfully...
:{{Black Screen|''Kiminami Anna starts making pizza...''}}
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' It's done!
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' This pizza looks... pretty good...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, these are for you.
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' I'll make sure to savor this pizza's taste...
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' If it's not bad... it should be officially launched as a new dish soon.
