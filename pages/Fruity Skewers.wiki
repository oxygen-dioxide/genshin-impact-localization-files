==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* To celebrate Kaeya's birthday, the official Chinese site for ''Genshin Impact'' published a blog post with [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/12147 real-life recipes] for Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, Fruity Skewers, and his favorite drink, Death After Noon.
* Despite being called Fruity Skewers, fruit isn't used in it; rather, the fruitiness is derived from marinating the chicken in sparkling white wine. For his own skewers, Kaeya uses Death After Noon &mdash; a mix of sparkling white wine and dandelion wine, though the real-life recipe substitutes dandelion wine with {{w|absinthe}}.
