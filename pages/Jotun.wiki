:'''Jotun:''' Got something you need to say? Give it to me straight; good news or bad news, it doesn't bother me either way.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Jotun:''' I'm a hunter. Only sensible choice if you're living in Springvale, right?
::'''Jotun:''' Not that it bothers me either way.
::'''Jotun:''' Draff tells me what to do and I go do it. Easy peasy.
::'''Jotun:''' I cannot be doing with one of them jobs where you have to think for yourself and whatnot.

==Trivia==
* His name in the English version is the anglicized form of the {{w|Old Norse}} word {{w|Jötunn|Jǫtunn}}, a member from a kind of giant deities in the Norse mythology who are the arch rivals of the Æsir (a kind of main deities such as Odin and Thor). It cognates with the archaic English word {{wt|ettin}} ("giant").
