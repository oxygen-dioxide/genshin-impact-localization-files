The '''Mikoshi Clan''' was a prominent [[Inazuma]]n clan around five hundred years ago that continues to exist in the present.

Its most famous member was [[Chiyo]], an [[oni]] who was close with the Raiden Shogun [[Ei]]. However, during the [[cataclysm]], Chiyo was consumed and tainted by an [[abyss]]al beast; she later drew her blade on Ei, was defeated in battle, and disappeared. This betrayal tarnished the Mikoshi Clan's reputation.<ref name="ESF">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Emblem of Severed Fate}}</ref>

==Overview==
Five hundred years ago, those related to the Mikoshi Clan by blood had oni blood running through their veins.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Sundered Feather}} description<br />''"You are now 'Iwakura.' You are no longer the 'Mikoshi' who shoulders the burden of oni blood."''</ref> It is currently assumed that Chiyo was a full-blooded oni or at least recognizably oni,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Mask of the Kijin}}</ref> but her biological son [[Iwakura Doukei]] was described as a "mortal in whose veins runs the blood of the oni,"<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Magnificent Tsuba}}</ref> indicating his father was human and Doukei himself was more human than oni.

While the Mikoshi Clan continues to live on in the present day,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Mikoshi Genjirou|quote=And as expected, the future of the Mikoshi clan is still mine to uphold.}}</ref> whether they have oni blood is unknown. Doukei abandoned his Mikoshi name and adopted the name "Iwakura," founding the [[Iwakura Clan]]. Meanwhile, the Mikoshi Clan descendants now living in [[Inazuma City]] are said to be the descendants of [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]], who was adopted into the clan and was presumably human.<ref name="The Narukami Trail">{{Ref/Quest|The Narukami Trail|quote='''Inagi Hotomi:''' His [Mikoshi Nagamasa's] bloodline has been passed down to this day. Most people in the city who have the surname Mikoshi today are his descendants.}}</ref>
