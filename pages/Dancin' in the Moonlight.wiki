===Pre-Quest===
Magnifico can be found on a butte between [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] and the [[Tezcatepetonco Range]] [[Statue of The Seven]].

;(Approach ???)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''???:''' The graffiti's really interesting...

;(Talk to ???)
:'''???:''' Hehe, you must have noticed the graffiti on this stone wall as well, haven't you?
:'''???:''' See those two differently-colored stone pillars in front of me. I guess they have some connection to the graffiti...
:'''???:''' Looks like we're missing one stone pillar in the middle. Where could it be, I wonder?

;(Upon solving the puzzle)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''???:''' It'll make for good photos, that's for sure...

;(Talk to ??? again, optional)
:'''???:''' Ah, I see, I see! It's perfect now!

;(Approach the camp south of "Flower-Feather Clan")
:'''???:''' *cough* Help... Help me...

;(Get closer to the camp)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hroo...? Rawr! Raaawr!
:'''Paimon:''' But where is he? All Paimon sees is a child lying down here...

;(Approach Magnifico)
:;(If Magnifico was not met before){{Verify}}
:::'''???:''' Hello, darkness, my old friend...
:::'''Paimon:''' Whoa... It's a... child who talks like an adult? That's so weird!
:::'''???:''' Hey, didn't your parents teach you any respect for people like me? We little folk can do great things too, you know!
:::'''???:''' In truth, many great things are accomplished by tiny people like me...
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh, he's even got a beard! That's... kinda... Urgh...
:::'''???:''' Don't you use my beard to shame me!
:::{{DIcon}} Hello, old friend. It's me, darkness.
::::'''???:''' Uh... No. No need to play along with me like that. What I mean to say is that I... haven't much time left.
::::{{DIcon}} ...I see.
:::::'''Paimon:''' Wow, you're all dried up like a fish out of water... Poor you.
:::::'''{{Little One}}:''' Wrrooo...
:::::'''???:''' What? Hey! Where's your human empathy gone?
:::::'''???:''' Give me water, would you? I'm dying of thirst over here, can't you see?
::::{{DIcon}} What would you like?
:::::'''???:''' Ah, that's the stuff! This is the first time in the three days I've been stuck here that I've heard a human speak...!
:::::'''???:''' I'll take 2 servings of Meal No. 9, one Big No. 9, one Meal No. 6 with extra sauce, one Meal No. 7, two servings of the No. 45, one with which I'll take some cheese, and a large glass of [[Fonta]] to top it all off.
:::::'''Paimon:''' Alright, and what else would you like?
:::::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrooo, Awrr?
:::::'''???:''' What else do I need? What do you think? Water, you...! Can't you tell I'm parched?
:::{{DIcon}} Calm down. How should we help you?
::::'''???:''' Water... Please... Thank you...

:;(If Magnifico was met before){{Verify}}
:::'''???:''' Hello, darkness, my old friend...
:::'''Paimon:''' Whoa... It's a... child who talks like an adult? That's so weird!
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, isn't this the magnificent Magnifico?
:::{{DIcon}} Mag... what?
::::'''Magnifico:''' Mag... Magnifico, the magnificent Magnifico!
::::'''Magnifico:''' Uh... I know that if anything, I look a bit down-on-out right now, but please, give me some water... Help me out here...
:::{{DIcon}} Not sure where we're getting "magnificent" from...
::::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, you've kinda dried out like a fish... Poor thing...
::::'''Magnifico:''' Hey! Have some human empathy, will you?
:::{{DIcon}} Hello, old friend. It's me, darkness.
::::'''Paimon:''' ...What?
::::'''Magnifico:''' Haha! Yeah, that's the one! I love that song too!
::::'''Magnifico:''' Ah... Simeon and Carbuncle... I never get tired of their music... But speaking of which, I lost my last job on their account. That's why I ended up here, taking this blasted risk...
::::'''Magnifico:''' Uh... but that's a story for later, haha. Right now, what really matters is, can you get me some water, please?
::::'''Magnifico:''' After all, well... Haha... It's just... sorry, but I'm dying of thirst here, hehe...
::::'''Paimon:''' This is life or death we're talking about, and yours, too! What are you giggling about!?
::::'''Magnifico:''' No idea. Might be terminal lucidity.
::::'''Paimon:''' Oh... huh!?
:::'''Magnifico:''' Water... Please... Thank you...
:::'''Paimon:''' Wow... He's looking half-dead again... Should we help him?

;(Talk to Magnifico again, optional)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehrrr... Mrr? Rawr! Rawr!
:'''???:''' {{Color|buzzword|Water... Please, get me some water}}... Thank you...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's take a quick look at this guy. He's all laid out on the ground, and it doesn't look good!

;(Interact with "History of Teyvat{{colon}} Part I", optional)
:'''"History of Teyvat: Part I":''' (A work by [[Fontaine|Fontainian]] playwright, Jean Brooklyn. A book this thick can totally be used by shorter people to increase their height.)

;(Interact with "Lavender Flower", optional)
:'''"Lavender Flower:"''' (A romance novel written by Dorothy Leeckson. On its faded cover, a woman lies on a bed surrounded by flowers.)
:'''"Lavender Flower:"''' (After skimming through the book, you feel warm and content, but haven't gained any useful insights.)
:'''Paimon:''' So... Was it her family's gardener or her best friend's cousin's brother-in-law?... Ugh, Paimon's head hurts!

;(If the player breaks the [[Elemental Amber|Hydro Amber]])
::'''???:''' *cough* *splutter*
::'''???:''' *panting* Th&mdash;Thank you... Oh, life is beautiful...
::{{Black Screen|You figure out a way to help the thirsty person, and you notice that his body seems to have grown a size bigger after getting some water in his system.}}
::'''???:''' *cough* *pant* Haha, I see, so that was an Iktomisaurus trick... Just one of the reasons I'm here, if you must know.
::'''Paimon:''' Alright, just take it easy and drink some water before we talk!
::'''???:''' *cough* No, no, I'll be fine. Thank you for saving me!

;({{cx}}){{Verify|Possibly use hydro attacks on Magnifico?}}
::'''???:''' *cough* *splutter* *pant* Th&mdash;Thank you... Thank you so much... Oh, life is beautiful...
::{{Black Screen|You figure out a way to help the thirsty person, and you notice that his body seems to have grown a size bigger after getting some water in his system.}}
::'''Magnifico:''' Phew... *cough* *cough* Thank you... But... *cough* You could have saved me a bit less... aggressively... I can't swim, you know...
::'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we'd have figured out a way to reel you back in in time!
::'''Magnifico:''' I'd rather you not do any such thing on the fly, but regardless... thank you for saving me!

:'''Magnifico:''' Magnifico de la Magnificans. Just "Magnifico" will do. As you can see, I am of noble Fontainian stock.
:'''Magnifico:''' My old friends sometimes call me "The Detective," at times "Brutus," and sometimes "Mr. Mag"... But you two may call me whatever you wish.
:'''Paimon:''' This guy's kinda strange, don'cha think?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hroor...
:{{DIcon}} What's with "The Detective"?
::'''Magnifico:''' I once worked at the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] as a detective for a few years, working on several major cases with Inspector Frank Drebin. He eventually made Superintendent, while I retired.
::'''Magnifico:''' Ah, those were unforgettable days...
::'''Magnifico:''' A boy met a girl, the boy lost the girl, the girl searched for the boy, the boy forgot the girl, the boy remembered the girl, and the girl was crushed under one of the pretty [[Fontinalia Festival]] floats three times...
::'''Paimon:''' Okay, you can stop with your weird flashbacks now...
:{{DIcon}} "Brutus," you say...?
::'''Magnifico:''' Ah, you might not know this, but I used to be a detective with the Marechaussee Phantom for a few years, serving under Inspector Frank Drebin.
::'''Magnifico:''' There was once when we saw five people in robes attacking an old man with knives in the park, right in front of over a hundred people! And then, "bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!"
::'''Magnifico:''' Laid them all out, no exceptions. Hah! "Do you feel lucky, punk?"
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa...
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Wrraaa...
::'''Magnifico:''' Later, the chief of police told me that they were [[Fontaine Research Institute|Research Institute]] administrative staff rehearsing "[[Remuria]]."
::'''Paimon:''' Huh!?
::'''Magnifico:''' Hence the name, "Brutus"!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Wooraarr?
::'''Magnifico:''' It didn't matter, anyway. The Institute was cutting down on redundant staff at the time, so they'd have had to resign sooner or later.
:{{DIcon}} As for "Mr. Mag"...?
::'''Magnifico:''' Why, it's my extraordinary charm, of course. Such magnetism is mine that all who know me are inexorably drawn to me!
::'''Paimon:''' Ehh...?
::'''Magnifico:''' Also... all unassuming metal objects, scattered Mora, small jewelry, and so on, will be inexplicably attracted to my pockets!
::'''Paimon:''' Aren't you more like "Mr. Klepto," then!?
::'''Magnifico:''' Indeed, and that is one of my clan's great virtues!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Eee&mdash;！
:'''Magnifico:''' *cough* Anyway, after retiring from the Marechaussee Phantom, I was idle for a time, before deciding to become a photographer, capturing the vitality within people and objects...
:'''Magnifico:''' That is why I am here in Natlan &mdash; home to the most shockingly dazzling elemental life forms!
:'''Paimon:''' Perhaps the most "shocking" thing of all is the way you almost bit it, right here...
:'''Magnifico:''' Hehe, and you have my apologies for that. I will not forget that you saved my life.
:'''Magnifico:''' How about this... Let me mark the spot I'm going to next on your map... Yes, right here.
:'''Magnifico:''' Ah, wait... Where have my manners gone? I haven't even asked for your names yet!
:{{DIcon}} I'm {{Traveler}}.
:'''Paimon:''' Call me Paimon! And this here is {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehrroo!
:'''Magnifico:''' Wonderful, wonderful! {{Traveler}}... and Paimon. Names to remember, to be sure!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehrr? Roo? Raar&mdash;!
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha, relax, relax! I'll remember you too, {{Little One}}!
:'''Magnifico:''' May we meet again soon in our respective journeys. Perhaps I might even need your help again... or perhaps you might need mine!
:'''Paimon:''' You're going that far out... Well, mind you don't get too thirsty, alright?
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha, there's no way I'd do that! Let's meet again, shall we?
:{{Black Screen|Magnifico quickly packs his bags and water supplies, then waves you goodbye.<br>Not long after, his short silhouette disappears from sight.}}
----
;(Approach the main building in [["Masters of the Night-Wind"]])
:'''Paimon:''' *pants* Phew... Almost... there! This mountain path is so hard to climb. How's little Magnifico going to get up here?

;(Approach the first photo spot)
:'''Magnifico:''' Now I thought I heard people talking about me &mdash; but I never expected it to be you! Hah, what a coincidence!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Guess we forgot you have a hot-air balloon, huh? Not that you've ever brought us along on it, you stingy...!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawoo! Rawoo!
:'''Magnifico:''' Well, you've never asked, have you?
:'''Paimon:''' And why would we... Ugh, you never told us, so how would we know that asking was even an option!
:'''Magnifico:''' A pleasure to meet you all again, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, and dear little Paimon!
:'''Magnifico:''' See, I knew we'd meet again! Just in time, too &mdash; there's something I need your help with.
:'''Paimon:''' Here? Is it something tricky?
:'''Magnifico:''' Not too much trouble, really. You'll find out in a jiffy!
:'''Magnifico:''' Hehe, either way, do make way. I'm about to make landfall!
:{{Black Screen|Magnifico leaps nimbly from his hot-air balloon and retrieves his [[Kamera|Film Kamera]] and tripod from his luggage, assembling them in an open space.<br>He soon finishes his work and stands before you proudly.}}
:'''Magnifico:''' Ker-chak! Behold, a miracle of light and shadow &mdash; Fontaine's latest industrial achievement!
:'''Paimon:''' What? That's nothing new to us. Also, you haven't told us what you need help with yet!
:{{DIcon}} Yes, just come out with it.
::'''Paimon:''' From the looks of it, you probably want us to help you take a photo, right?
:{{DIcon}} Pay up and I'll help.
::'''Paimon:''' We're super cool, so Mora up front.
:'''Magnifico:''' Oh... Well, sure! Here's your deposit. Please take it.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait. This is a ton of Mora!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wrraa!
:'''Magnifico:''' As you have seen, I need to take a few pictures of [[Saurian]]s, and I'm not talking about one of those three-view drawings you see in animal illustration books either... What I'm going for is something full of vitality!
:'''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;Yeah, okay!
:'''Magnifico:''' But on the other hand... more vitality means "less likely to listen to me." So, if it's convenient, could you dear adventurers please help me take the ideal pictures I need?
:'''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;Yeah, okay!
:'''Magnifico:''' Of course, you don't have to force yourself to do things beyond your ability, but I suspect you could at least protect me from hostile life forms.
:'''Magnifico:''' So please, keep the deposit... and as for whether to help or not, I'll leave that decision to you!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... All this money's making this bag super heavy... You sure it's all ours?
:'''Magnifico:''' Come on, you think I'd deceive you? Or should I double-check the sum for you?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehehe... Hahaha! Well, looks like you've come to the right people, because Paimon is a renowned Saurian tamer here in Natlan!
:'''Paimon:''' Don'cha worry. So long as {{Traveler}} and Paimon are here, any Saurian you wish to tame will be tamed!
:'''Paimon:''' [[Tepetlisaur]]s? Easy-peasy? [[Qucusaur]]s? Cheddar-cheesy! Iktomisaurs? Lemon-squeezy... Uh, we also do [[Koholasaur]]s, [[Yumkasaur]]s, [[Tatankasaur|Tachankasaurs]]...
:{{DIcon}} Tachankasaurs?
:{{DIcon}} One moment there, Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' ...Bigheadasaurs, Miniarmasaurs, Gigagogglesaurs, Scarysaurs, Superscarysaurs, Somewhatscarysaurs, Weirdosaurs, Normiesaurs, Skinnysaurs, Hulkasaurs...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hoohroo!
:{{DIcon}} What are you talking about, Paimon?
:{{DIcon}} Back it up, Paimon. Listen to yourself!
:'''Paimon:''' And... the Rawoorasaurs!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawoo, rawoo!
:'''Paimon:''' And the Wraahrasaurs!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wraah! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, you name 'em, we can handle 'em!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hrrm, Hrmm!
:{{DIcon}} *sigh* Alright, we'll help you.
::'''Paimon:''' Of course we will. We've already taken a deposit of that size, after all! Right, {{Little One}}?
::'''Magnifico:''' Ah, wonderful. Wonderful!
:;(Continue to next section)
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I've got things to do.
::'''Paimon:''' But we've already taken the deposit...
::'''Magnifico:''' Ha, it's fine. Just wait till you have the time! It's not like I'll melt into a helpless puddle without your help, eh?
;(Obtain {{Item|Mora|x=100,000}})

;(Interact with "Fontainian Perfume Ad Collection", optional)
:'''"Fontainian Perfume Ad Collection":''' (A photo album that doesn't seem rather popular. It's filled with images of beautiful young ladies.)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph... Just pictures of girls? Boring!

;(Approach Magnifico again &mdash; one of these lines appear)
::'''Magnifico:''' "...Hates [[Court of Fontaine|Fontaine City]]... So cold and so damp... *humming*... Those people all dressed like monkeys~"
::<hr>
::'''Magnifico:''' "...Woke this morning feeling so fine, got something special on my mind~ Met a girl in the neighborhood last night~"
::<hr>
::'''Magnifico:''' "...Berries, apples, and an angel's kiss... my autumn wine is made from this~"

;(Talk to Magnifico again if "Sorry, I've got things to do" was chosen)
:'''Magnifico:''' "Louis, Louis!" ...Ah! You scared me half to death there!
:'''Magnifico:''' So, have you changed your mind, or are you just here to say hello?
:{{DIcon}} To say hello, and help while we're at it.
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Hoohroo~
::'''Magnifico:''' Haha. That's wonderful, then. Let us get started!
:;(Continue to next section)
:{{DIcon}} We're just passing through.
::'''Magnifico:''' Alright then, best of luck!
----
;(After accepting Magnifico's offer)
:'''Magnifico:''' Hmm... Next up, an Iktomisaurus under the moonlight! Yes, that sounds good. Getting the ideal lighting is going to take some work, though.
:'''Magnifico:''' Hmm... Aha! It's your time to shine, {{Little One}}, my little friend!
:'''Paimon:''' Little? Pfft. He's nearly taller than you, Paimon'll have you know!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrwar? Roo?
:'''Magnifico:''' Very good, very good... The timing's perfect... Haha! My masterpiece is almost complete...
:'''Paimon:''' Then make sure you get a good shot, just like the subject's one of your Fontainian girls! Hehe, that's how the line goes, right?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hrooo, rroooh!
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha, just relax!
:'''Magnifico:''' This angle! This moonlight Ah! Ah! Simply perfecto!
:'''Magnifico:''' Just a moment, let me see... I'll need two more light sources. One needs to light up the Iktomisaurus's profile, so we get that contrast between warm light and the backdrop of night... That's how we'll create an air of mystery.
:'''Magnifico:''' And the other light source needs to illuminate the Saurian's silhouette. Not for any complicated reasons, but it is a necessity.
:'''Magnifico:''' Yes, yes... That's what we're looking for! Just like a dream...
:'''Magnifico:''' What the... Drat!
:'''Magnifico:''' I'm sorry, but perhaps the atmospheric elemental concentration here differs from that in Fontaine. Something must've gone wrong with the machine... But no rush, everyone. Let me check.
:'''Magnifico:''' *humming* Hmm... Not here... Not here either...
:'''Magnifico:''' Dammit, dammit, damn it all! Gah! You sickened blackguard, you cosseted, coddled nincompoop! Arrrgh!
:'''Magnifico:''' You... You...!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey, calm down!
:{{DIcon}} It's practically smoking!
:{{DIcon}} What's going on? You getting a divorce?
::'''Paimon:''' What!?
:'''Magnifico:''' Phew... Well... It's a goner now, isn't it?
:'''Paimon:''' ...
:'''Magnifico:''' Heh. Don't look at me like that. If nothing else, I feel better now!
:'''Magnifico:''' *sigh* Well, it's as you see. Our artificial lighting is broken &mdash; and after all that Mora I spent on it, too. Disappointing. Just like my ex-wife...
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, just... stop for now. Chill out, and don't panic. We're here to help!
:'''Magnifico:''' *sigh* I'm sorry... Phew. Alright. What do I need? Ah, yes. I need to shine one light on the {{Color|buzzword|left side of the Iktomisaurus's face}}, and the other on the {{Color|buzzword|contours of its back}}.
:'''Paimon:''' No problem! Let's do this!
:{{Black Screen|And so, Magnifico begins tinkering with his Kamera once more, leaving you all to think about how to make a suitable light source...}}

;(Talk to Magnifico again, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' Go work on the lighting. I don't require any help over here.
:'''Magnifico:''' {{Color|buzzword|Light up the left side of its face, as well as the outline of its back!}}

;(Talk to Magnifico again while indwelling, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' Wait... Why did you disappear when the Iktomisaurus showed up? And why did it disappear once you returned?
:'''Magnifico:''' Could it be that...
:'''Paimon:''' That's right, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} went off to the bathroom!
:'''Magnifico:''' ?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, just think about it. We couldn't all go at the same time, could we? That'd be awkward &mdash; and embarrassing, too!
:'''Magnifico:''' Oh, yeah, right... Haha, of course! {{Traveler}} couldn't turn into a Saurian! Surely not! Not that it'd be a bad thing, of course.

;(If the light is placed in front of the kamera, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha! Well, that sure makes me look handsome! But I'm afraid this isn't the time to take a shot of myself!
:'''Magnifico:''' Please switch positions and {{Color|buzzword|light up the left side of its face, as well as the outline of its back!}}

;(If the light is placed next to Magnifico, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' No, no, no! The warm light's facing the wrong way. You're blocking the moonlight, and that won't do!
:'''Magnifico:''' Switch positions and {{Color|buzzword|light up the left side of its face, as well as the outline of its back!}}

;(If the light is placed directly behind {{Little One}}, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' Well, getting such a sheen on one's rear end through lighting is quite the achievement in its own right. Yes, the image is most clear... But I don't think you'd have me take it.
:'''Magnifico:''' How about a different spot? {{Color|buzzword|Light up the left side of its face and the outline of its back!}}

;(If the light is placed in any other incorrect positions, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' Hmm... The light source position isn't right. It needs to be adjusted a bit more.
:'''Magnifico:''' Switch positions and {{Color|buzzword|light up the left side of its face, as well as the outline of its back!}}

;(Upon placing the first light in the correct spot)
:'''Magnifico:''' Good, that's it... And here's another one!

;(Upon placing the second light in the correct spot)
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha, you're a genius! Yes, the lighting is most suitable!
:'''Magnifico:''' Wonderful, perfect lighting! I'm going to hit the shutter now!

;(After correctly placing the lighting)
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha, good, good! Come now, my little model, stay still... Yes, you're so very clever! Three, two, one, say cheese!
:'''Magnifico:''' Ah, would you look at that? A masterpiece? And whose work is it? Yes, mine &mdash; Magnifico de la Magnificans!
:'''Magnifico:''' Thank you, thank you so much! Haha! Now then, here's the balance I owe you! Ah... and this too. Look.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, a final payment...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... Of only one Mora?
:;(The Traveler, indwelling an Iktomisaurus, gets on the box)
:'''Magnifico:''' Great... And now, our true protagonists are about to make an appearance! Come on in, don't be shy! You're a star, so make that entrance dazzle!
:'''Magnifico:''' Phew, and that's a wrap! Here, take this copy as a gift... and know that you have obtained this masterpiece before any Fontainian gallery could!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks. We'll treasure it.
::'''Paimon:''' But, the final payment...
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't look like it'll be worth much Mora...
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Wrooh? Wroo...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah... Paimon's disappointed too... She thought the final payment would be more substantial than the deposit...
:'''Magnifico:''' I'll be heading to this location next... Here, let me mark it out on your map. Who knows, perhaps our next meeting might be just around the corner!
:'''Magnifico:''' And when it comes, I might even need your help once more!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, you're practically taking us for granted, aren't you?
:'''Magnifico:''' Well, our meeting wasn't for me to decide. T'was fate &mdash; yes, fate! &mdash; that brought us together.
:'''Magnifico:''' See you, and good luck, my friends!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Raaawr!
