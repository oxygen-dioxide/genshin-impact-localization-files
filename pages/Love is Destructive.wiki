'''''Love is Destructive''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player must complete {{Quest|Meeting Is Also Parting}}.

==Trivia==
* The Indonesian name is a reference to the song ''"Cinta Ini Membunuhku"'' by the Indonesian band {{w|id:d'Masiv|d'Masiv}}.
* It appears to be a direct reference to Episode 25 of the anime series "Neon Genesis Evangelion," which shares the same title. This connection is strengthened by the fact that in several languages, including Japanese and Chinese, the achievement's name is not translated, indicating a deliberate choice to preserve the original reference.
