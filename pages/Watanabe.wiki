==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Watanabe:''' I should really push these new guys harder. Tomorrow, I'll make them stand at attention for half an hour and then give them a set of one hundred push-ups.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Watanabe:''' I'm a Doushin in charge of recruit training here. You can call me Instructor Watanabe.
::'''Watanabe:''' I've got to say that the recruits nowadays lack perseverance and patience. How will they serve the Shogun like that?
::'''Watanabe:''' Eh... why am I telling you this stuff? No outsiders are allowed on the drill grounds!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Watanabe:''' Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!
