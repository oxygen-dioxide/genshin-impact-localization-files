{{Description|A fungus that grows in layers upon layers, like a sea of clouds, and which mostly grows on trees deep in the rainforest. Therefore, they are considered by the people of Sumeru to be the holy crystallization of [[Rukkhadevata]]'s legacy.<br>In Sumeru, those who dwell in the forest have a tradition of offering Rukkhashava Mushrooms to the [[Akademiya]], but no one knows what these offerings are meant to be used for. Word has it that the Akademiya always performs a secret annual ritual at the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]], during which the sages will consume these mushrooms to commemorate Lord Rukkhadevata's sacrifice.|[[Archive]]}}
{{Description|A fungus that grows in layers upon layers, like a sea of clouds,  which mostly grows on trees deep in the rainforest and is considered by the people of Sumeru to be a symbol of the gods' grace.<br>Legend has it that in ancient times, there was once a towering giant tree with its crown covering the entire Sumeru. People addressed it as Rukkhadevata and believed the Fungi scattered throughout the rainforest were the holy crystallization of its legacy. In Sumeru, those who dwell in the forest have a tradition of offering Rukkhashava Mushrooms to the Akademiya, but no one knows what these offerings are meant to be used for.|[[Archive]], after ''[[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]]''}}
