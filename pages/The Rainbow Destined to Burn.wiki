==Summary==
;Beneath the Secret Source

Heading to the Speaker's Chamber, Mavuika informs the three that she had located Capitano. Citlali informs her of Ororon's memory, of which she finds it dangerous and that his plan needed to be stopped, as it would be the same as using the Gnosis. Paimon wonders as to what forces they have, as the Abyss is still attacking. Mavuika states that she, Xilonen, Kinich and the Traveler would fight the Fatui, having a plan to handle the threat. 

Mavuika intends to fight the Captain again, stating that if they could destroy the Source Mechanism, his plan would be stopped. Kinich and Xilonen advise against fighting him again, since she had lost her powers to fuel the Sacred Flame. Mavuika tells Kinich that Capitano would be guarding the device, and thus he and Ajaw would distract the bulk of the Fatui with a frontal assault while Xilonen would bring the others close to the device to destroy it. They ambush a patrol away from the camp and excavate a tunnel, infiltrating the base.

The group manages to reach Capitano and Ororon, who activates the device. Suddenly, Ororon becomes inexplicably powerful and attempts to attack Xilonen, only for Capitano to stop him and use a spell on him, demanding to know the entity occupying his body. The entity address him as "Commander," though the distraction allows the Traveler to shut the device off. The entity is upset that Capitano still worries for others even if it means losing.

Elsewhere, Ororon looks at his previous memories before a strange soul named [[Guthred]], a [[Khaenri'ah|Khaenri'ahn]] who insults Ororon over his worthlessness and plans to take his body once he dies. Ororon, refusing to go down quietly as he hadn't done anything meaningful in his life, resolves to keep going as a bright light appears from above. Mavuika commends Ororon for being able to withstand the pain with a damaged soul before asking if it was truly what he wanted. Ororon states that he just wants an answer for his life, just as his [[Ancient Name]] "Bidii," or devotion, appears for him revealing [[Sanhaj]], a hero of the Masters of Night-Wind from the past. He is the fifth hero in the plan to repel the Abyss for good.

A voice then echoes through the cavern, revealing itself to be [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night]], that Citlali had mentioned earlier. When the device was activated, it resulted in a cry that affected Ororon more due to his damaged soul, though she was impressed by how he managed to compose himself. Xilonen asks if that was responsible for his odd behavior, but the Lord of the Night tells her that another soul had tried to take refuge but was expelled, though its origins were unknown. Capitano asks why the Source Mechanism only awoke her rather than repair the lines, and she tells him that it was the source of the nation's Ley Lines. Mavuika explains that when the Descender and the dragons fought, it caused immense damage, especially to Natlan's Ley Lines. To stabilize them, the Lord of the Night used fragments of the old Ley Lines to reconstruct a similar network &mdash; the Night Kingdom.

The dragons tried to use the device to strengthen the Ley Lines with power, though they were ineffective as they could not navigate their intricate structures. As the Ley Lines have changed again, the Lord of the Night could rebuild the Ley Lines once more at the cost of her existence, while revealing that in the past, she was worshipped as a "lord" &mdash; before her kind died out, they were known as "Angels," though they are more commonly known in their devolved form as [[Seelie]]s. The Lord of the Night states that due to Capitano and Ororon's plan, she could fulfill her promise to rebuild the Ley Lines at Mavuika's command, though Mavuika refuses; it would be no different than using the Gnosis. Capitano states that they don't have a choice, but Mavuika states that if the Abyss were to invade again, it would be worse for future generations. Paimon asks why he was so pessimistic about the situation, and he reveals that he is a survivor of Khaenri'ah who personally witnessed the horrors of the Abyss.

Capitano insists on ignoring false hope and maximizing the chances of survival, while Mavuika continues to reject his reasoning as it would make their life meaningless. As the two continue arguing, Ororon interjects, stating that with his life rekindled, he wishes to have a life with meaning. Xilonen agrees with him, and the Lord of the Night states that she is ready to perform the deed if they need to in the foreseeable future. Capitano begrudgingly agrees to Mavuika's plan, as it had the potential to create the best outcome and grants her his subordinates to use along with his direct assistance. With a new plan in tow, they leave to have the group outside stop fighting each other.

; As One We Watch the Setting Sun

Returning to the Speaker's Chamber, Mavuika formally welcomes the Fatui into the alliance against the Abyss. She then asks Capitano how he knew about the Source Mechanism &mdash; he reveals that since they weren't getting to the Gnosis, he decided to look for alternate means with Ororon's help. They had tracked down three scholars; [[Aberewaa]], [[Bosomtwe]] and [[Cuxtal]], combining their research to locate it. Paimon then asks him how he knew about the Gnosis' power, and he reveals that after the situation in Khaenri'ah had become unsalvageable, he fled with the rest of his platoon to Natlan, which was suffering the same fate. He met with the Masters' chief, [[Ayizu]], who treated him with respect even though many people blamed Khaenri'ah for the disaster. Thus, he resolved to protect Natlan and fought many battles with him, though when he died, he revealed the secret of the Gnosis to him. Mavuika is surprised that he had told Capitano of it, though she had refused all of his suggestions to use it even before the cataclysm. However, she fails to recognize Capitano and assumes the mask must be why.

Capitano states that despite his curse, his flesh still rotted and thus he would not be recognizable to her. Paimon then asks if he knew about [[Dainsleif]], as he didn't appear to be having as much of an issue. Capitano is surprised to learn they know of him, so Paimon asks if he knew him too. He states that he only knew his name and that he was travelling with the [[Traveler's Sibling]] the last time he saw him in person, noting that his pain and hatred was much stronger than his own. Thus, as the Traveler was the sibling of Dainsleif's companion, he did not want to harm them. He also laments that apart from his physical appearance, his strength had also waned, though Mavuika states that he was still incredibly strong. Capitano states that if they had fought 500 years ago, the outcome could have been much more different. Regardless, he acknowledges that he failed to acquire the Gnosis, as he intended to use it to save Natlan and then, should it have not been destroyed in the attempt, give it to the Tsaritsa.

Mavuika tells him that her opinion on the matter would not change, so Paimon asks what would happen when all six heroes were united. She tells them that they would use a power that [[Xbalanque]] gained from [[Ronova]], a god who predated the Archons and had power over death. Mavuika states that the Abyss would likely increase their attacks after sensing the change in Ororon.

The Traveler and Paimon leave the chamber to find Kachina and Mualani tending to various people. The Traveler notes that a sense of dread appears to be intensifying and wonders if they have enough time for the final hero to appear. 

Returning to the Weary Inn once more for a short rest, Citlali and Xilonen meet up to visit the Lord of the Night. The Lord of the Night asks if they intend to give the Traveler an Ancient Name even though it would mean Xilonen would have to sacrifice her life for doing so, confirming to Citlali that what she heard about the forging of an Ancient Name consuming the life of the Name Engraver was indeed true. Meanwhile, Citlali intends to use the Traveler's status as a Descender to stall Mavuika's death, as it was what she foresaw in her ritual, though the Lord of the Night cautions that the fate of someone's death and death itself are actually two different things, and all the Traveler can affect is if Mavuika dies in the near future or not. the Lord of the Night tells them that she could not give them much advice on the matter, but is impressed by human determination and knew that their creator had looked on them favorably. Citlali also voices a desire to find a way to keep the Lord of the Night alive after Natlan has dealt with the Abyss, a sentiment that the Lord is grateful for but states that there's nothing they can do. In her view of the grand scheme of things, how much longer she lives is a non-issue, though the pair point out that is what makes humans different, and even if their end comes tomorrow, humanity will still do whatever it takes to survive today. The Lord of the Night creates the [[Pilgrim's Chronicle]], a parchment that would record the Traveler's deeds in Natlan, both past and future.

Back at the inn, the Traveler and Paimon wake up from their rest and meet up with Citlali and Xilonen, who hand them the parchment. On examining it, Paimon spots that it has recorded that they previously helped Kachina win the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]]. The Traveler is somewhat concerned that the item came at a high price, but Citlali and Xilonen deflect the question by pointing out that the Lord of the Night was willing to sacrifice herself for Natlan and in comparison, the parchment cost nothing. Just then, Kachina runs in, telling them that the Abyss was attacking once again.
----
;The Surging Darkness

Heading outside the stadium, Mavuika orders [[Tumpis]] to inform the others about her battle plan against the Abyss, just as the group arrives and gets a rundown from her. The Abyss had sensed Ororon's acknowledgement and were increasing their attacks all over the nation, as even remote areas in the Collective of Plenty were reporting attacks. As such, they only needed to hold out for the last hero, so Mavuika sends Xilonen and Kachina to their tribe while Citlali would use a hot air balloon to return to her tribe. Mavuika tasks the Traveler and Paimon with handling various matters across the nation, granting them a hot air balloon for faster travelling.

After handling several matters, the Traveler returns to a checkpoint outside the stadium, repelling a massive Abyss attack. As the battle rages, a massive surge of energy envelops the Sacred Flame, causing numerous pylons to appear and drop off both normal and abyssal manifestations of hilichurls and riftwolves. Mavuika manages to subdue the rift briefly with the Gnosis, while the Natlanese and the Fatui fight the monsters. Kinich also heads out to investigate the rift.
----
;Despair Engulfs the Heavens

Despite the efforts of the defenders, the Abyssal invasion slowly begins to overwhelm them. The Traveler and Paimon witness the horrors of war as they see the bodies of both humans and Saurians littering the battlefield, having sacrificed their lives to protect others. At a camp in the [[Sulfurous Veins]], the Traveler assists the remaining defenders in repelling an attack. Regardless if the Traveler had helped out or not, [[Chimalli]] declares the base lost and allows the group to either support the Children of Echoes or retreat to the stadium. To his surprise, all of his soldiers wish to join in the fight, as to honor the sacrifices made by their allies. Just then, the Traveler spots a purple streak crashing to the ground, which Chimalli realizes had landed near the People of the Springs. The group parts ways, with the Traveler heading to investigate the crash site.

Arriving at the site, they discover that their attacks fail to deal any damage to the tumor. Worried that more monsters might come, Paimon tells the Traveler to look for anything of value. They find a battle report, though the situation is incredibly dire with casualties increasing as more tumors begin to fall across the nation. As they take a hot air balloon, Paimon becomes horrified with the amount of monsters roaming the wilds, and they soon see that the Scions of the Canopy had fallen to them. Continuing onward, Paimon has had enough of the war, though the Traveler is confident they would eventually prevail in the end. 

They soon spot a group of people fighting several riftwolves and slay the monsters, allowing a brief moment of respite. Paimon wonders as to how they can destroy the tumors, while [[Maztla]] states that that they have no idea. He believes they came from the "sky-demon" from above and they generated massive amounts of pylons, overwhelming the defenders. Aware that they are on a losing battle, they decide the best course of action is to retreat to the stadium, where the Sacred Flame would repel the Abyss. The Traveler and Paimon head to the Children of Echoes to help with evac, finding Kachina and Xilonen fighting the monsters off. Pacal had ordered a full evacuation, and they and a few others had stayed behind to stop the monsters from pursuing them. They eliminate the monsters before leaving the village, where they reunite with the other group that had left earlier.

Kachina informs them that Kinich returned with news that the tumors had dropped all across the nation, while the Flower-Feather Clan was hit the hardest. Kinich had organized a team to provide support, while Paimon is worried about Chasca and Chuychu. Pacal states that it would only be a matter of time before the stadium would be unfeasible to defend, resulting in a bloodbath. The Traveler resolves to help out, while Xilonen, Kachina and Pacal bring the group to the stadium.

On the way, they find Chasca and Chuychu surrounded by a few monsters and eliminate them. Paimon then notices that Chuychu is unconscious and contaminated with abyssal energy. The Traveler siphons away the energy and purifies it which allows Chuychu to wake up, but despite their efforts to save her she ultimately succumbs to her injuries, but not before thanking Chasca and saying goodbye. Chasca flies into a rage, emitting abyssal energy for a brief moment, but left with Chuychu's final words of comfort finds the strength to calm herself. The Traveler and Paimon give her some space, but Paimon spots Chasca crouching over Chuychu as her Ancient Name appears. The bearer, [[Menilek]], remarks on the pain Chasca was suffering, thus making her the final hero for Mavuika's plan. They bring her body to the stadium, with everyone present acknowledging her sacrifice. Mavuika promises to honor her and bring the war to an end now that all six heroes are assembled.

Heading to the center of the stadium, Mavuika and the six heroes begin the ritual to empower their Archon, who declares a Night Warden War with the Ode of Resurrection now applying to everyone in Natlan. The six are resolved to stomp the Abyss for good, while Chasca thanks the Traveler for coming in time, allowing Chuychu to say her final words and allowing her to control her grief. The group then sets out to destroy the tumors, with Mavuika's powers assisting in destroying them. As the defenders begin to repel the Abyss, Kinich senses that it's now sending larger units around the stadium in an attempt to extinguish the Sacred Flame. The group rushes back to defend the stadium, and as the last of the monsters are dealt with, Mavuika uses her powers to destroy the rift, much to the joy of the Natlanese. The sheer strength of her attack briefly exposes a [[False Sky|"false sky,"]] though no one appears to pay much attention to it.
----
;A Fuel Named "Fate"

With the battle over, the group assembles at the Weary Inn, where a celebratory feast is being held. Mavuika states that their efforts have forced the Abyss deep into the depths of the Night Kingdom, and she will go there alone to stamp out the remaining traces of Abyss, as the levels of Abyss energy would be instantly lethal on contact for anyone else. She promises to grant the fallen a worthy funeral, while Xilonen suggests giving a moment of silence for them. Mavuika then thanks Capitano for his efforts, who gives his congratulations on the Natlaneses' victory.

The Traveler speaks with Mavuika, who expresses regret for not being able to save Chuychu. Nonetheless, she asks if they would be willing to accompany her to the depths of the Night Kingdom, though the plan's details would be discussed tomorrow.

After resting for the night, they head to the Speaker's Chamber, during which Citlali intercepts them, telling them that despite their valiant efforts in defending the nation, Mavuika's use of Ronova's powers meant that she was still slated to die. Citlali asks them to try and circumvent her death by some means. Mavuika reminisces about her past before the Traveler arrives, and after learning of the Lord of the Night's gift, reveals her reasoning for requesting their aid: their resistance to the Abyss meant that the Traveler would be the only known person that could safely join her final assault, but only if their Ancient Name could be completed. She would go alone rather than risk the Traveler not having access to the Ode of Resurrection, but if they do become a true Ancient Name bearer, she would love to have them there to back her up. Unfortunately, this meant that Paimon would have to stay behind, as the Abyss could otherwise make her a target and put them into a dangerous situation.

Elsewhere, Capitano returns to the Lord of the Night, aware that Mavuika used Ronova's powers and thus will have to die for doing so. The Lord of the Night wonders how he was aware of it before realizing that the Ruler of Death had also sent him on a long journey. He has his own final foe to face, and asks for her help for the sake of the lost souls and Natlan's future.
