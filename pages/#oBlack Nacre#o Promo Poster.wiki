|description    = A promotional poster from the "[[Daiya's Three-Day Reverie]]" attraction in the [[Veluriyam Mirage]], depicting the central ideas and themes behind "[[The Black Nacre and the All-Devouring Kraken]]," with the primary focus on the huge pirate ship itself. Taking into consideration that guests may come from many countries, the crew members and design elements of the ship are quite international. Though, if one were to truly construct a ship and set it on the same scale as the one shown on the poster, the cost would be truly astronomical...
