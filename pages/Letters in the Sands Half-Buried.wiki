|description    = "These plants are quite special indeed, and their leaves can be used as letter-paper on which to write. If you use this in concert with the previously mentioned red dye, writing on these leaves with said dye, you can add a measure of secrecy to your writings, for the words will only emerge after being affected by [[Electro]] first, and then [[Dendro]]. As such, even if they mean to do so, the researchers of the [[Akademiya]] will not be able to gain knowledge of what is being communicated between one Matra and another.<br />The latest edition of the Matra manual has this to say concerning this species of desert shrub.<br />It is only when they reach this description that the Matra understand why their superior has bypassed the researchers and amended their manual &mdash; if, one day, the Matra were to meet with some great emergency, they would at least have a safe and secret way of communicating critical information to one another.
