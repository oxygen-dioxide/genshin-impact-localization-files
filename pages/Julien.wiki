'''Julien''' is a quest-exclusive NPC who appears in the [[World Quest]] series [[An Artist Adrift (Part 1)|''An Artist Adrift'']]. 

He is an artist from [[Fontaine]] traveling with a dog named [[Pepper (NPC)|Pepper]].

==Profile==
Julien's desire is to become a renowned artist, an ambition hampered by his total colorblindness. In the past, he befriended a person named [[Caterpillar]], who gave him the ability to only ever draw perfect renditions of anything he saw. However, Julien's colorblindness meant he was unable to use realistic colors in his depictions. He was unable to make a name as an artist but became a very effective counterfeiter, a crime for which he was caught and imprisoned in the [[Fortress of Meropide]]. After serving his sentence, he decided to become a legitimate artist, and to that end took up Caterpillar's advice to follow the [[Oceanid]]s' pilgrimage and find a cure that is supposedly capable of curing anything.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Artist Adrift (Part 2)}}</ref>

After passing through [[Chenyu Vale]] and setting foot in the [[Girdle of the Sands]], he was taken by surprise at the abrupt change in climate. He also quickly became lost and followed Pepper to [[Samudra Coast]] in [[Gavireh Lajavard]], [[Sumeru]], but lost his raft along the way and became stranded until the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] found him.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Artist Adrift (Part 1)}}</ref>
