Within the [[Spiral Abyss]] and certain [[Domains]], monsters may have an '''aura''' that can cast special effects.

==Debuff Abilities==
{{See also|Ley Line Disorder|Domains|Status}}
*The aura from enemies will apply its debuff to the in-range characters currently on the field. Once you switch the on-field character to next character, the debuff will be inherited by next character.
**The effect of auras from enemies only influence the characters currently on the field.
**When the element gauges of the aura is depleted, auras and debuffs on characters will disappear immediately.
*The interval between each pulse is '''15''' seconds.
**After starting the challenge, it takes 15 seconds for the enemy to release the first pulse.
*Elemental debuffs are marked with the element in question inside of a prohibitory ðŸš« symbol.

The duration of the aura from enemies is '''not''' determined by the elemental gauge of the aura.
*The durations of auras are  '''20''' seconds.
*The [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauges]] of the elemental status applied by the debuffs is '''1 unit'''.
*Durations of auras from enemies '''cannot''' reduced by [[Elemental Resonance]] or [[Artifacts]].
*The {{Color|Pyro DMG}} from Smoldering Flames has '''0''' Pyro.

==Damage Abilities==
The names of these abilities come from the official update log.<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.mihoyo.com/m/en/news/detail/9368 Version 1.4 Update Details]</ref>

* Damage is determined by the base multiplier of the ability, the [[Elemental Reaction/Level Scaling#Level Multiplier|Level Multiplier]], and the [[RES]] of the target to the damage type. The DMG dealt by these abilities is not affected by the target's [[DEF]] or [[DMG Reduction]].
** For calculations,<br><math>\text{Damage} = (\text{Base Multiplier} \times \text{Level Multiplier} \times \text{RES Multiplier})</math>
* The durations of the elemental statuses applied on characters is determined by the [[gauge unit]], which functions identically to those applied by characters.
* Defeating the enemy that cast the skill will immediately cause the skill's effects to despawn. (This does not include any damage or elements already afflicted by these effects; e.g., Pursuing Fireball will disappear, but any character who was previously hit by it will still be affected by Pyro.)
* The skills have a fixed cooldown.

==Trivia==
* The element of most auras matches the damage type of the enemy they are attached to. However, there are exceptions:
** [[Ruin Machine|Ruin machines]] may have a variety of elemental auras despite primarily or entirely dealing {{Color|[[Physical]] DMG}}.
** A [[Rock Shieldwall Mitachurl]] in the Unyielding III challenge of the [[Ridge Watch]] [[Domain]] has a [[Tracking Fire Ball]] aura despite being incapable of dealing {{Color|[[Pyro]] DMG}}.
