'''Tidecaller''' is [[Beidou]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* This skill generates '''2''' [[Elemental Particle]]s when it hits at least 1 target, or up to '''4''' when it hits with energy stored.
*The skill description is somewhat misleading. The Press skill has the same functionality as the Hold skill (including the shield and energy storing), but only during a very brief window.
*After holding the skill for about 3 seconds, the attack will be released automatically.
*If the shield breaks, the player will take the rest of the remaining damage used to break the shield.
*The shield disappears upon release of the attack.
*Pressing or holding the skill gains DMG bonus, a [[Interruption Resistance|Poise damage]] bonus, swing range bonus, and generates one extra elemental particle for each hit Beidou takes during the duration. Maximum bonuses are granted at 2 hits, or a "perfect counter" with [[Retribution|Passive Talent 1]].
** The hits can be from any damage instance, including fire damage from burning grass.
**When pressing or holding the skill, there will be a bubble around the character that lasts for a fraction of a second. If the player gets hit in the time frame the bubble is still up, it gives the maximum damage for the skill (same as if Beidou was hit twice).
***After triggering this perfect counter, the player can continue to hold it, but it will not increase the damage further when hit.
**The perfect counter can be instantly activated by pressing this skill while standing in damage over time environments like burning [[grass]], braziers, torches, or campfires.
**A perfect counter will '''not''' negate all damage if the damage taken breaks the shield.

** The wind-up before Beidou begins Charged Attacks is reduced.
