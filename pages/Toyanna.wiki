==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Toyanna:''' This is so tough. How can I get a balanced number of [[Qucusaur]]s on both sides...
:{{DIcon}} Do you need a hand?
::'''Toyanna:''' Oh, it's okay. Don't worry about it. It's no big problem. Or rather, it's no problem at all &mdash; it's just something I'm taking issue with...
::'''Toyanna:''' I'm the air traffic staff responsible for directing landing Qucusaurs.
::'''Toyanna:''' It's not usually a problem when there are only a few of them. But if a large number are returning to base all at the same time, then I need to use hand or flag signals to command them.
::'''Toyanna:''' Sometimes we've got all these [[Saurian]]s trying to land on the same flat patch of land at the same time, which is pure chaos.
::{{DIcon}} I'll tell you what needs balancing. It's...
::'''Toyanna:''' The scales of my heart.
::'''Toyanna:''' ...Sorry, sorry. That was a corny line, I know!
::'''Toyanna:''' I just... When I see a huge gap in the number of Saurians landing on one side of the high ground compared to the other, I start feeling a little... upset.
::'''Toyanna:''' But if I go and disturb the resting Qucusaurus, asking them to relocate, it'd be making a mountain out of a molehill...
::'''Toyanna:''' *sigh* And if that keeps happening, the Saurians will hate me...
::'''Toyanna:''' So, jokes aside, I'm afraid I really will have to find balance within myself.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Toyanna:''' It's okay. This is a "me problem"...
