==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Antila:''' *sigh* There are more important things we could be doing...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Antila:''' I'm a photographer from [[The Steambird]]. I'm here with [[Houallet]] for an interview.
::'''Antila:''' But really, this case just looks like a series of coincidences &mdash; if we're unable to interview the fugitive involved, there'll be nothing to write about, really.
::'''Antila:''' That [[Monsieur Volonte Nouvelle|"Monsieur"]] has quite the good temper, to be going along with Houallet like that.
::{{DIcon}} A fugitive?
:::'''Antila:''' Well, the case went like this...
:::'''Antila:''' The "Monsieur" tripped a thief who had stolen a wallet with a crowbar.
:::'''Antila:''' The wallet contained a picture taken by [[Nolette|the owner]] of the wallet, and in the background of that photo was a criminal on the run.
:::'''Antila:''' ...And yeah, that's how evidence fell from the skies, enabling the [[Maison Gardiennage]] to catch a fugitive.
:::'''Antila:''' The culprit has already been locked away in the [[Fortress of Meropide]] &mdash; hardly a convenient interview subject. As such, there's really no opportunity to dig any deeper.
:::'''Antila:''' I know that Houallet knows this as well, but he just doesn't want [[Charlotte]] to score the monthly reprint slots with her stories again.
::{{DIcon}} Why's he called "Monsieur"?
:::'''Antila:''' Oh, interested in this title, are you? This is the term of address given to distinguished Honored Citizens of Fontaine.
:::'''Antila:''' These titles are gained by valiant deeds that aid investigations that make great contributions to defending the peace in Fontaine, much like that dear "Monsieur" did.
:::'''Antila:''' Not that an Honorary Citizen is very high up the "Monsieur" totem pole &mdash; as I recall, the highest you can go there is "Duke".
:::'''Antila:''' And that's not the sort of person Houallet can interview, I reckon.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Antila:''' See you. To be honest, I'd have left myself if it wasn't for work.
