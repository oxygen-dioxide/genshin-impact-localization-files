|description  = The core component of the Experimental Field Generator.<br>A precision-machined mechanical component that counteracts the effects of gravity via high-speed rotation. The revolution speed is so fast that it is almost impossible to capture with the naked eye.<br>Throughout its long history, the [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering]] has always warred against a flood that once washed countless lives away, and may yet cover the earth and sky one day far in the future, searching for a means to survive.<br>[[Arkhium]], with its immense energetic potential and power to shatter the shackles of the earth, was once considered the key to the gate of salvation.
