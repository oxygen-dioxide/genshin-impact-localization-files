==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arina:''' I want some time off... When can I get some time off?
:'''Armin:''' Don't you like studying here?
:'''Arina:''' I like studying here! It's just... I'm a little anxious about home...
:'''Armin:''' It will be okay. Mother and father are taking care of the farm. Nothing will go wrong!
:'''Armin:''' When we've learned more, we can make money and help them out!
:'''Armin:''' Then father, mother, you, and Aranara will all live happily ever after.
:'''Arina:''' You're wrong, Armin. The teachers have said many times that Aranara don't exist.
:'''Arina:''' We've been going to classes long enough for us to grow up.
:'''Armin:''' But Vikram told me last time that Aranara do exist...
:'''Arina:''' What he said was that conceptually, Aranara exist.
:'''Armin:''' Aren't conceptual Aranara still Aranara?
:'''Arina:''' Uh... I'm not too sure either. Let's ask the teacher.
