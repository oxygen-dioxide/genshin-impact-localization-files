|desc_basic      = A variety of vegetables are mixed together, then chopped into small pieces and stewed with meat. The addition of lemons gives the final product a mildly sour taste. The people of Sumeru usually enjoy this dish over rice.
|desc_delicious  = The fragrant ingredients complement each other perfectly. Large pieces of fresh meat are stewed until tender and coated in dark green, as if inviting all who taste it for a leisurely stroll in the forest.
