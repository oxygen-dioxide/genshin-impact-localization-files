|text      = Some new stickers that are rather distinct in color have shown up in the office. If I'm not mistaken, they're drawings of cake. Although I've already expressed my gratitude to the [[Melusine]]s, it seems that similar treats have still found their way into the Coupon Cafeteria.

I believe the best way to reciprocate is by sharing this gift. So, I'll set aside the two largest pieces for you and Paimon &mdash; it's only fair, given your contributions.

On a separate note, I've come across a few materials that might be of use to you among the recently confiscated contraband. If not, feel free to browse the rest.
