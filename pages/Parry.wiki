** In [[Hues of the Violet Garden]], the base DMG of the counterattack is '''2250% [[ATK]]'''.
** In [[Warrior's Spirit]], the base DMG of the counterattack is '''2625% ATK'''.

==Trivia==
* [[Beidou]], [[Candace]], and [[Yun Jin]]'s [[Elemental Skill]]s, [[Tidecaller]], [[Sacred Rite: Heron's Sanctum]], [[Opening Flourish]], combined with their [[Passive Talent]]s [[Retribution]], [[Aegis of Crossed Arrows]], and [[True to Oneself]] respectively, are similar to the Parry mechanic. However, they are not the same. Parry can completely negate incoming damage due to invincibility frames, but the aforementioned Elemental Skills prevent damage with their shields, which can be broken with enough damage. In addition, Parry reflects enemy damage, while "parrying" with the aforementioned Elemental Skills increases their own damage.
