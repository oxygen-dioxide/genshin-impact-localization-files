==Trivia==
* The following birthday mails included Dizziness-Be-Gone no Jutsu Version 2.0:
** [[Birthday/Sayu#Nap Time!|Sayu's 2021 Birthday Mail]] (1 Dizziness-Be-Gone no Jutsu Version 2.0)
*The dish is perhaps based on rice balls in ''{{w|kyaraben}}'' (character bento), a type of Japanese boxed lunch whose food is decorated to portray fictional characters and animals.
*''{{w|Bake-danuki|Tanuki}}'' and ''{{w|mujina}}'' are magic-wielding animals in Japanese folklore. As a real animal, ''tanuki'' is uniquely identified with {{w|Japanese raccoon dog|Japanese raccoon dogs}}; meanwhile, as a real animal, ''mujina'' is synonymous with ''anaguma'' (Japanese badgers)  in many cases but can refer to ''tanuki'' (Japanese raccoon dog) and ''hakubishin'' (masked palm civet), depending on region. Therefore, ''tanuki'' and ''mujina'' may refer to the same real-life species in some cases.
**Despite Sayu's vehement denial for unclear reasons, the color pattern of the animal's face is identical to real-life ''tanuki'' (Japanese raccoon dogs).
