==Description==
A secret tome that belonged to the scholars of the Knights of Favonius. It holds the collective knowledge of the scholars.<br />
It is inlaid with crystallized elements, which is what makes the Favonius Codex such a quality.<br />
Not only because the elemental crystals are precious, but also because each Favonius Codex is hand-made.<br />
Only scholars who have mastered the control of the elements can create such elemental crystals.<ref group="Note">The translation of this sentence is a rather poor one, omitting some key words that change the sentence; the original Chinese phrase, {{zh|只有真正掌握了元素的奥妙的学者}}, lends closer to "Only scholars who have truly unraveled the mysteries of the elements can refine such elemental crystals."</ref>

When the Knights of Favonius was founded, the Dawn Knight [[Ragnvindr]] turned the aristocrats' indoor baths into a library.<br />
In time, countless contributions from bards, scholars and travelers turned the library into the largest collection of literature in the northern half of the continent.<br />
After all, songs are whisked away by the wind and wine's pleasure lasts but a fleeting moment. Only that which is committed to the page may sparkle and shine for eternity.

Even so, the scale of the library's collection is now a fraction of what it was at its peak.<ref group="Note">The Chinese version specifies that the current library collection is one-sixth of its original size.</ref><br />
For sadly, the library once burned down in the "Great Fire of Fall Equinox" tragedy.

There is a large sturdy door made of poplar wood in the library basement.<br />
It is said the door predates the founding of the library and stood firm against the smoke and flames.<br />
The truth is this door stood there long before the Knights of Favonius was ever founded.<br />
The Knights of Favonius officially states that the restricted section of the library is housed behind the door.<br />
But tales tell of a far more profound secret hidden within.
