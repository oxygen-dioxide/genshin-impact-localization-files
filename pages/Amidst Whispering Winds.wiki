|description    = A bedroom that embodies the idea of a "caring heart." For busy folk, a bedroom may just be a place that contains a bed, a place where one gets a little shut-eye, and which does not require too much care. But for those with an eye for detail, every part of one's living space is worth time and care.<br />Whether they be the winds of freedom or resistance, they all began as the tiniest of gentle breezes. One who travels far must take good care of themselves, and surely fatigue will slip away unnoticed if one lives surrounded by warmth and comfort.
