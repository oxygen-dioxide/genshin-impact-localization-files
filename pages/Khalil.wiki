{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Khalil:''' The plants... will soon wither...
:'''Khalil:''' But they will not save... They will destroy!
:'''Khalil:''' Divine knowledge... knowledge of the gods... save...

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Khalil:''' Hello there. Welcome back to Aaru Village!
:{{DIcon}} You know me?
::'''Khalil:''' Hahaha, Isak has mentioned you more than once, so I recognised you right away.
::'''Khalil:''' Honestly, I'm ashamed that I was too much of a mess to thank you earlier. It's all thanks to you, really, that I'm able to continue living here with him.
::'''Khalil:''' There was this lady named [[Setaria]] who came over to ask me if I wanted to return to the Akademiya, but in the end, I decided to stay here.
::'''Khalil:''' For one thing, I can't just leave Isak to fend for himself here, and on the other hand, Aaru Village has helped me a lot. And for the other, leaving just like this doesn't sit right with me.
::'''Khalil:''' I may be old, but I was once a researcher too. I should be able to contribute to the village's development somehow.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
::'''Khalil:''' Take care!
