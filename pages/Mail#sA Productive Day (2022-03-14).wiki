|text    = Early this morning, I was chased out of my office by my fellow [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]]. They told me I could go wherever I wanted, as long as it didn't involve work.

Although I do understand they mean well, it seemed a bit excessive to instruct the knight guarding the door to my office to prevent me from entering, right in front of me.

So, I went to [[Windrise]], then went up the road to [[Starsnatch Cliff]].

It's been a long time since I've been out patrolling in person. I've found some potential hazards on the outskirts of [[Mondstadt]], and I'll need to gather a group to develop further plans.

I enclosed some [[Windwheel Aster|flowers]] picked along the way and materials collected after defeating monsters. I hope they'll help you on your journey.

...Now that I think about it, it has actually been a rather productive day.
