==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Muirne:''' Hello there. Here to check out the ocean view as well?
:{{DIcon}} You're...
::'''Muirne:''' My name's Muirne. You can just call me Muirne.
::'''Muirne:''' Huh. I think I repeated myself there. Sorry, hehe...
::'''Muirne:''' Looking at the sea brings a lot of things to my heart, and my mind moves slower, too.
::{{DIcon}} What's on your mind?
::'''Muirne:''' A lot of things. Sometimes I think of more and more things, and I stand for longer periods of time.
::'''Muirne:''' Once, [[Neuvillette|Monsieur Neuvillette]] saw me watching the sea, and he stood beside me in deep thought.
::'''Muirne:''' And slowly, more and more people started gathering behind us.
::'''Muirne:''' Everyone was tiptoeing to watch the sea, muttering to themselves, "is something happening out there?"
::'''Muirne:''' Humans are so cute.
::'''Muirne:''' But in truth, the thing I was considering was very simple. It's an everyday thing &mdash; what am I going to eat later?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'm starting to think, too...
:::'''Muirne:''' Now that we're talking about food, let me give this to you. Take it and you won't need to worry anymore.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Poisson Seafood Soup|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Could I join you?
::'''Muirne:''' Sure you can. The view here's really nice, by the way.
