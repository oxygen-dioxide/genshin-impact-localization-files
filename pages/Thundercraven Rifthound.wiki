===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.

{{Description|A beast with monstrous blood that is capable of eroding the boundaries of the world. They were created by [[Rhinedottir|"Gold"]]. <br>Once upon a time, they ran riot across the continent, but they went extinct for a time due to resistance and mass hunts. Recently, however, they have re-emerged. The pack of black wolves that now threaten [[Springvale]] and [[Wolvendom]] are such creatures.|[[Archive]]}}
