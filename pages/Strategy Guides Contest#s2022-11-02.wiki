# Travelers, please pay attention to HoYoLAB's System Messages, as information of merchandise prize-winners will be sent out via such messages. We ask prize-winners to provide their shipping address according to the prompts stated in the system message. Prize-winners who have not provided their address within the specified time frame will be deemed to have voluntarily forfeited their merchandise prizes.
# Please go to My Information > Information Management > Genshin Impact in HoYoLAB to fill in your Genshin Impact UID ahead of time. If Primogem-winning Travelers have not filled in their UID or filled in the incorrect UID after the list of winners is announced, they will be deemed to have forfeited their Primogems reward.
