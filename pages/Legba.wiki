{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Legba:''' Ah! Ha, so it's you. How've things been going? Well, I trust?
:'''Legba:''' If you're tired, you can rest up here. And you can rest easy, for I will keep watch.
:{{DIcon}} About the young [[Saurian]]s with marks on their heads...
::'''Legba:''' Ah, you mean the mark on {{Little One}}'s head?
::'''Legba:''' I've heard that young Saurians with such marks are far stronger than their peers... Though, it's probably no more than a rumor. Sorry, I don't really know much about Saurians.
:{{DIcon}} About manifestations of the [[Wayob]]'s will...
::'''Legba:''' It is said to be a thread of the Wayob's will. Many in the tribe have seen them, and as they say, "They've got their own reasons for appearing aboveground."
::'''Legba:''' Stuff like... An obsidian statue being stolen, ha!
::'''Legba:''' But mostly, tribespeople opt to sneak past them. Ah, though they do often appear in the tales of storytellers...
::'''Legba:''' They test the brave with trials, punish the greedy, or guide heroes onto the right path... stuff like that.
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing, I was just on my way...
::'''Legba:''' Very well then. Safe travels.

==Trivia==
* {{w|Papa Legba}} is a {{w|Lwa}} in many religions such as {{w|West African Vodún}}, {{w|Dominican Vudú}}, {{w|Haitian Vodou}}, and {{w|Louisiana Voodoo}}.
* Due to sharing a similar name and model with the Legba seen in [[Och-Kan]]'s memories during [[Moment of Awakening]], it is implied that this Legba may be a disguise of [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]].
