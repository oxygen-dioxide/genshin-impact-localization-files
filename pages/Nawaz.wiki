==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nawaz:''' [[Scarab]]s~ Oh, Scarabs~ Where are you~?
:{{DIcon}} Scarabs?
::'''Nawaz:''' Huh, you don't know what Scarabs are? They're the most awesome bugs ever!
::'''Nawaz:''' They have the coolest shells, the coolest patterns, and they shine the coolest gold under the sun!
::'''Nawaz:''' I've heard the adults say that Scarabs contain something truly amazing, put inside them by [[King Deshret]] himself so that they can protect us.
::'''Nawaz:''' I mean, doesn't that just sound like the best thing ever?
::{{DIcon}} Could you tell me more about King Deshret?
:::'''Nawaz:''' Well, I don't actually know that much myself. Some adults say that we should believe in the Dendro Archon, and others say that we should believe in King Deshret...
:::'''Nawaz:''' Do those gods just not get along or something?
:::'''Nawaz:''' King Deshret has the coolest Scarabs, but those adults who tell me to believe in King Deshret always sound so annoying... I don't like them.
:::'''Nawaz:''' I've heard that King Deshret once had loads of awesome animal friends! Sheep, wolves, and... and... what was that again...?
:::'''Nawaz:''' Well, whatever the case, how could he be an unfriendly god if he was such good friends with the animals?
:::'''Nawaz:''' But if that was true, why are the people who believe in him so unfriendly?
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Make sure to be friendly to others.
::::'''Nawaz:''' Yeah, that's what I think, too!
::::'''Nawaz:''' A friendly person has gotta have the coolest bug!
::::'''Nawaz:''' Speaking of which, you don't have any Scarabs yet, do you? C'mon, I'll give you a few &mdash; and may they protect you and those around you!
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Scarab|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Where are they?
::'''Nawaz:''' Where are they~?♪
