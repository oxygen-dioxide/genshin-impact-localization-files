==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Genichirou is a member of the [[Mikoshi Clan]], a clan with [[oni]] heritage, and the older brother of [[Mikoshi Genjirou]]. Considered to be dull, simple and sluggish by those familiar with him, he chose to open up Netsuke no Gen Crafts to help his neighbors out with his handiwork. By the time the [[Traveler]] arrived, his store had just run out of stock for the time being.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Hello, see anything you like? If you can't find the right one, I can have one custom-made for you.
:{{DIcon|Souvenir}} I'd like to buy a few things... ''<small>(Before reaching Sakura Level 50)</small>''
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Let me see what you need, dear customer...
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Ah, my sincere apologies, but we are still in the midst of arranging for the goods that you require.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Our capacities are limited, and it will take some time for the goods to be restocked, so please do come again then.
:{{DIcon|Souvenir}} I'd like to get some souvenirs. ''<small>(After reaching Sakura Level 50)</small>''
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Be my guest. Just let me know when you see something you like.
:;(Opens [[Souvenir Shop]])
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your store...
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' You mean where the name of this store came from?
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Haha, I see you're not from Inazuma.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Netsuke is a kind of small craftwork that the Inazumans carry with them as pendants. Generally, they are carved into different shapes based on the owner's preference.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Take this one for instance. If you cross the rope from the inner side of the belt and then hang a coin pouch, seal or stamp on it, the netsuke will be stuck onto the belt. Convenient, eh?
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' As for the "Gen" part of the name... Well, it's my name, actually.
:{{DIcon}} What can you make to order?
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' What would you like? Just tell me, and I will do my best to make it happen.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' This store may not be as famous as those old family stores on this street, but we are still proud of our fine craftmanship.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' To be honest, I'm actually the eldest son of my family, but people always say that I am simple and dull, and that I probably won't be able to carry on with the family business.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Haha, that's why I would rather start a small store here and help the neighbors out with my handiwork.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you! Goodbye.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Goodbye! Come back next time if you need anything.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* The description of the Furnishing item "[[Inazuman Store: Numberless Gems]]" mentions Mikoshi Genichirou and his store. It also possibly explains his empty shop: from time to time the supply cannot meet demand because of the store's need to constantly restock, as caused by lack of storage space.
