'''Noblesse Oblige''' is an [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities which can be obtained from [[Clear Pool and Mountain Cavern]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*2-Piece Bonus:
**The 2-Piece Bonus is considered [[Damage Bonus]] and is additive with other Damage Bonus sources such as Elemental DMG% from a [[Goblet of Eonothem]].
**The 2-Piece Bonus does not affect any buffs provided by [[Elemental Burst]]s such as the Normal/Charged/Plunging Attack DMG Bonus from [[Xiao]]'s [[Bane of All Evil]].
**The 2-Piece Bonus affects any damage directly caused by an Elemental Burst including the {{Color|Electro DMG}} from [[Razor]]'s [[Lightning Fang]].
*4-Piece Bonus:
**Having more than one character in your team equip 4-Piece Noblesse Oblige does not stack the ATK gained from the bonus. It only refreshes the duration.
**However, the 4-Piece Bonus can stack with the other sources of ATK such as the 4-Piece Bonus of [[Tenacity of the Millelith]].
*A 5{{star}} Royal Flora can be obtained from the [[Nine Pillars of Peace]] [[World Quest]].
