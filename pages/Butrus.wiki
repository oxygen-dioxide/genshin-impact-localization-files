==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Butrus:''' My fish have good meat! Kittens eat them and meow in happiness!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Have some fish.
::'''Butrus:''' Take your pick! All fresh!
:;(Opens [[Shops|Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon}} Your fish...
::'''Butrus:''' Caught and sold on the same day! Fresh fish! Pay purely for the weight, no tricks!
::'''Butrus:''' Look at these fish and shrimp! All fat and fresh! Press on them and they bounce back, probably with enough force to push you into the sea!
::'''Butrus:''' I'd have gotten a full scholarship if the Akademiya opened a fishing school. If they graded on freshness, I'd be awarded all of the degrees.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Sounds a bit exaggerated.
:::'''Butrus:''' Exaggerated? No, no, no!
:::'''Butrus:''' I've been selling fish here my whole life. If I were a guy who exaggerates, I would've been shunned by customers and lost my business long ago.
:::'''Butrus:''' I know you won't believe me without trying it. Here, take some and have a taste! It's on the house!
:::'''Butrus:''' If you think they're good, then come back often.
::;(Obtain [[Fish]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Your cats...
::'''Butrus:''' Uh, are they my cats? I don't think so...
::'''Butrus:''' I don't know where they came from either. Since I fed one, they've been coming to me one after another, bringing their families with them to have meals.
::'''Butrus:''' I can't help it either. The kittens are too cute, and I just can't stop my hand from feeding them fish!
::'''Butrus:''' There are even cats that came running from the inn owner's home, and they wouldn't leave. There, those two on the side.
::'''Butrus:''' But you know, they can't be blamed. I heard that their owner is going senile, and the cats are tired of hearing his rambling.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Butrus:''' Goodbye, please come again!
