{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Slash Attack
|desc_1 = Approaches and performs a cross slash with its claws, dealing '''55.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

|name_2 = Spinning Attack
|desc_2 = Leaps into the air, curls up and starts spinning like a top at high speeds upon landing, dealing '''44.4% ATK''' once as {{Color|Black|AoE Physical DMG}} and continuously interrupting the player, before dealing '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|AoE Physical DMG}} with the final spin.

|name_3 = Rolling Attack
|desc_3 = Curls up into a ball and starts rolling around at high speeds, dealing {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to the player on contact. The Hatchling does not target you and instead rolls around randomly and only changes directions when bumping into something. If the Hatchling crashes into a player protected by a shield, it'll get knocked out of its rolling state and become stunned for a few seconds.

|name_4 = Charge Attack
|desc_4 = Curls up into a ball and rolls towards the player. On hit, deals '''83.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} then bounces backwards and jumps back, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|AoE Physical DMG}} on landing. If the Hatchling crashes into a player protected by a shield, it'll get knocked out of its rolling state and become stunned for a few seconds.
|file_4_2 = Geovishap Hatchling Stunned
|caption_4_2 = Stunned

|name_5 = Leap
|desc_5 = Leaps into the air and smashes down at the player's location, dealing '''83.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|AoE Physical DMG}}.

|name_6 = Burrow
|desc_6 = Burrows into the ground and pops up a fair distance away, or next to the player. When digging itself into the ground, the Hatchling digs up 2 bright yellow Geo crystals which can be picked up by the player and form a shield, potentially protecting the player from the Hatchling's attacks.

==Strategy==
Geovishap Hatchlings are fairly easy to defeat but irritating at most. Their spin attack is particularly dangerous, as it can deal heavy damage while constantly staggering the player. They also have a habit of frequently burrowing, which makes them invulnerable to all damage during its animation.

When the hatchling burrows, it leaves behind two Geo crystals which may be picked to form a shield. After reappearing, the hatchling tends to roll around uncontrollably in the surrounding area, or charge straight at the player. If it runs into a player protected by a [[Shields|shield]], either from the crystals it leaves behind or through a character talent, it will be flipped over and attempt to get back on its feet, leaving it vulnerable and open for attack for several seconds.

Due to the Geovishap Hatchling's tendency to erratically move around, the [[Frozen]] reaction can be especially effective at extending its window of vulnerability.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A young vishap with a hard Geo exoskeleton.<br />Vishaps are exceptionally agile creatures that one would be wise not to underestimate in battle. Experts from [[Sumeru Akademiya]] believe that they become dragons when fully grown. By avoiding predators and natural disasters, perhaps they can even live long enough to become [[Geovishap|formidable beasts]] that reign over entire mountains.|[[Adventurer Handbook]] and [[Archive]]}}
