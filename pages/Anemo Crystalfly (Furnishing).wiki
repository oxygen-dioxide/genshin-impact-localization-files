|description    = Pure elemental life-forms composed of drifting [[Anemo]] particles, as free and unbound as the butterflies they resemble.<br>A glittering Anemo creature that is the product of rising and condensing elements, and which feeds off the ubiquitous power of Anemo.<br>They say that the flapping of a butterfly's wings has the power to whip up a storm. But within the Serenitea Pot, that raging storm will become a comfortable breeze.
