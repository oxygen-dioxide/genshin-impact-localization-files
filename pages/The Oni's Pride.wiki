{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon reaching Masato at the Watatsumi Army camp at [[Fort Fujitou]])
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Yo! You must be Masato?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 01.ogg}} '''Masato:''' A&mdash;An oni!? Oh no, not another one...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh &mdash; uh, yeah, not the one that robbed you though. So chill. I contacted you before, remember? I need your help.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 02.ogg}} '''Masato:''' Oh, right... Sorry, I'm still a bit on edge after the incident. Ahem, so anyway here's what happened. I was just out transporting some goods when a group of ronin suddenly attacked me.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 03.ogg}} '''Masato:''' It's not the first time that's happened to me. Usually, you just hand over some Mora and they'll leave you alone. At least you don't lose your goods that way.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 04.ogg}} '''Masato:''' But this time was different. They weren't willing to talk things over, instead, they took my things and then started coming for me.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? That's totally uncalled for!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 05.ogg}} '''Masato:''' I got down on my knees and begged. Said I had a family to care for and that my business is our only livelihood.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 06.ogg}} '''Masato:''' Then I saw that there was an oni among the group. I thought he was gonna be the one to finish me off.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 07.ogg}} '''Masato:''' But instead, he stopped the others and told them to let me go.
:{{DIcon}} How strange...
:{{DIcon}} So was there friction within the group?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 08.ogg}} '''Masato:''' Yeah. That got them all arguing with each other. His cohort said that I was sure to retaliate if they released me.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 09.ogg}} '''Masato:''' But the young oni was insistent that they shouldn't lay a finger on me. Things got real heated &mdash; I thought they were gonna come to blows.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 10.ogg}} '''Masato:''' Luckily, they let me escape with my life in the end, and I scrambled to get myself here, where I'd be safe. *sigh* I never want to set foot outside of here again.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' So he'll steal, but he won't harm people. Hmph, seems he has some sort of standards.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Did he say why they were robbing you?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 11.ogg}} '''Masato:''' ...Surely it was Mora, right? What else could they have wanted with me?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 12.ogg}} '''Masato:''' I mean, I can't say for sure. It's not like I asked... But what I did hear them say was, "The goods are worth more than the merchant's life," or something like that.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ugh, that idiot oni...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Do you have any idea where they went after they robbed you?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 13.ogg}} '''Masato:''' I have no clue, but I think they're pretty active in the Tatarasuna area.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 masato 14.ogg}} '''Masato:''' You aren't gonna go after them, are you? Seriously, I'd advise against it... There are too many of them, and they're all heavily armed.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, don't worry, it's just a bunch of no-name scumbags. I got a whole laundry list of scores to settle with them.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 1 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' If these two islands are where they tend to hang around, we're sure to run into them at {{Color|buzzword|Nazuchi Beach}} sooner or later.

;(Talk to Masato again)
:{{A|vo dialog ydlq003 masato 01.ogg}} '''Masato:''' I still think you should leave it alone... they're too dangerous.
:{{A|vo dialog ydlq003 masato 02.ogg}} '''Masato:''' Never mind the goods, I'm lucky just to have escaped with my life.

----

;(Upon reaching Nazuchi Beach)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 3 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' They gotta pass through here some time. So let's just hang tight for a while.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 3 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' If I'm not mistaken, they'll be showing up any time now.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, things might get a little rough, so we'd better be prepared.

:'''''After you wait for a while, the suspicious people finally emerge.'''''

:{{A|vo ydlq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, here they come!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 3 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Yeah, there they are. And one of them has horns.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 3 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Alright, it's go time. Let's get 'em!

;(While fighting the Nobushi)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 4 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Looks like you fellas aren't going down without a fight.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 4 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Fine by me! Let's fight first and talk later!

;(After defeating the Nobushi and talking to Takuya)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey! Don't even think about runnin'!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' It's me. Arataki Itto, descendant of the crimson oni!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 01.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Hmph, I know who you are.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 02.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' From the day we are born, every blue oni knows their purpose. We all know our fate is one of self-sacrifice.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 03.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' But what about the crimson oni, hmm? You don't know anything about us... Not our miserable history, or any of our names. Mine's Takuya, by the way. But you don't even care, do you?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 04.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Because those who get sacrificed should be forgotten, right?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' No, you're wrong. I never knew that the blue oni had survived to this day &mdash; and the moment I found out, I was determined that I would find you.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Since you remember the pact between our two factions, I assume you also remember the pride we share as oni.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' So my question is, how could a proud oni like yourself go and abuse the weak and plunder the innocent? Why break the oath that our kind swore all those years ago?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 05.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Hahaha!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh? What's so funny!?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 06.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Heh, who are you to talk about pride and oaths with me?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 07.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' The blue oni gave up everything! Just so the crimson oni could live peacefully in human society!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 08.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' But let me ask you, Arataki Itto, what exactly do you contribute to human society?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 09.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' You're a blundering fool who can't hold down a real job, a laughingstock of the town, and worse still, you let them get your Vision during the Vision Hunt Decree. Protecting the oni pride? Hah! You wouldn't know how if you tried!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 10.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' You're a disgrace to the oni kind!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, come on, none of that stuffs a big deal, I mean... heh, y&mdash;you're, uh, really hangin' me out to dry here, man...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 11.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Since when do you care what other people think? You just do whatever you want. It's not like anyone can stop you.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 12.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' But do you have any idea of the kind of life my kin and I have lived while you've been hanging around in human society?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 13.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' We were cut off from the rest of the world. We severed all contact with it, and since then we've had no place to live, no stable source of food...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 14.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' No clothing, no medicine, nothing! Besides the oath we swore to uphold and our so-called oni pride, we had nothing!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' So that's why you joined a band of thieves?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 15.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' That's right. Why should I accept that life? Is holding fast to a worthless oath supposed to help me provide for my family and friends?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 16.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' I've abandoned our oni pride, it's meaningless. I want to live.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 17.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' I've given everything that I've stolen from humans to my community. What I've taken will at least keep them from starving and ease their pain.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 18.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' That's what matters most to me.
:{{DIcon}} You don't need to go to such extremes.
:{{DIcon}} That doesn't actually solve the root problem.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! And besides, the blue oni sacrificed themselves so that oni could be accepted as part of human society!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If people see oni causing trouble again, then that'll defeat the whole purpose of the sacrifice you made!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 19.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Hmph, you make a good point. But Arataki Itto's the one who needs to get that into his thick skull.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 20.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' The blue oni are the bad guys, so we're expected to do bad things. Our actions won't tarnish the reputation of the crimson oni...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 21.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Unless, of course, this bonehead decides it'd be a great idea to take all the blame for himself, completely destroying the trust between humans and the crimson oni in the process...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 22.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' He's the one that's wasted the sacrifice we've made.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh!? I only had to do that because of you! I couldn't just stand back and let the Tenryou Commission drag you away!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 23.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' You should get your priorities straight!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 24.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' The blue oni are history, alright!? Forget about us! The crimson oni are the ones who must live on!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 25.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Why couldn't you have just stayed out of this!?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 ishizaki 01.ogg}} '''Ishizaki:''' There they are! Seize them!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:'''  Oh no! It's the Tenryou Commission!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 26.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Ugh, forget it! This was a waste of time anyway.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 takuya 27.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Look, I don't expect you to understand me. But you could at least take a look in the mirror sometime.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Heyyy!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He got away! Uh oh, we need to get out of here, too!
:{{DIcon}} It's too late!
:{{DIcon}} They've got us surrounded!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' We can't get caught here.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 11.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Looks like I'm up to bat. Just wait here, and we'll escape together when the time's right.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 5 itto 12.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Whatever you do, don't attack any of the Tenryou Commission or they'll be after you too.

;(While fighting the Tenryou Commission members)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 ishizaki 01.ogg}} '''Ishizaki:''' C'mon men! He won't get away this time.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 ishizaki 02.ogg}} '''Ishizaki:''' Just give yourself up, Arataki Itto.

;(After defeating Tenryou Commission members)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Man, they really came out in force today. I'm kinda flattered the Tenryou Commission sent so many...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' But I still haven't completely recovered from the bean attack earlier... I'm starting to lose my edge here.
:{{DIcon}} Why don't you let us explain the situation to them?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' No, no way!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' All that would do is send them after our blue oni friend instead. But, I have to settle things with him first, man to man!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then what should we do!? The Tenryou Commission's about to arrest you!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ugh, no choice but to keep kicking some Tenryou butt!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 akira 01.ogg}} '''Akira:''' Hey Boss! Thought you'd have all the fun without us, huh?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 genta 01.ogg}} '''Genta:''' Granny Oni sent us. We're here to lend a hand!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 mamoru 01.ogg}} '''Mamoru:''' Maybe we can't take 'em, but we can sure slow 'em down. Now's your chance &mdash; go!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey! I told you to stay outta this one!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 akira 02.ogg}} '''Akira:''' Well, we're in it now. C'mon, there's no time!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 genta 02.ogg}} '''Genta:''' Go do what you gotta do, Boss!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hmph, alright then!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Watch yourselves. Soon as I'm done, I'm coming back for you!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' C'mon you two! Time to roll!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 ishizaki 03.ogg}} '''Ishizaki:''' Don't let them get away! After them!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 mamoru 02.ogg}} '''Mamoru:''' Hey! You guys want some of this!? There's plenty to go around!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 7 genta 03.ogg}} '''Genta:''' Run for it, Boss!

----

:'''''You manage to escape with the help of Arataki's gang'''''

:{{A|vo ydlq003 8 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' As boss of the Arataki Gang, being rescued by my own boys feels... pretty humiliating.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 8 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' I promise never to let you down, boys! Alright, we got some footprints to follow. Let's find Takuya!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It was real touching and all, what they did, but those few guys weren't much of a gang...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 8 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, it takes Mora to run a gang, okay? They're all I got for now.

;(Continue following the footprints)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 8 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh? Is it just me, or are there more and more footprints here?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 8 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' At least we know we're headed the right way. Let's see what else we can find ahead.

;(Investigate the cart)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 9 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Wrecked carts and goods...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 9 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Look alive, we've got company!

;(After defeating the Nobushi)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 10 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Seems they definitely don't want us going any further.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 10 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Let's see what's waiting for us up ahead.

;(Upon reaching the fourth location)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 11 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh, besides the footprints, there are other signs of life here too. Must be plenty going on around here...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 11 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Let's investigate. They couldn't have just disappeared into thin air... unless they're all ninjas or something.

;(Upon reaching the entrance to [[Crumbling Guilt|the ronin hideout]])
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah! Hidden entrance! Yes! Alright! I think we just found their hideout.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' This is gonna be where they keep all the people they took.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks Takuya's probably going to be in there as well.
:{{DIcon}} Before we go in, I have a question.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh? Oh, fire away.
:{{DIcon}} Did you really understand where Takuya was coming from?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Heh, of course I did. C'mon, I'm not that dumb...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' But it takes a world-class blockhead like Takuya to think his ideas are actually going to work.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' So I'm here to save him, no matter what!
:{{DIcon}} Alright, that's good to hear.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What were you two talking about? Are you keeping Paimon in the dark again?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 13 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahahaha, let's go!

----

;(Upon descending into the first room of the hideout)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this place is huge! Pretty fancy for a hideout...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 14 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' All acquired by less-than-legitimate means, no doubt. And all the more reason we gotta put an end to this.

;(Upon reaching the mechanism for the stairs)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, how come the stairs are over there? We can't go up if we can't reach them!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 14 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' No problemo! That'll be what this mechanism is for.

;(Upon using the mechanism)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it's moving!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 14 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hehe, see? What did I tell ya? Just trust my instincts.

;(Upon reaching the room with the imprisoned hostages)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh! Look at all the people locked up in here!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 15 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' They must be holding onto them for leverage. Alright, let's get them out of here.

:'''''You free everyone inside.'''''

:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, you're all free to go now! Quick, get to safety!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 01.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' Sorry, but have you seen our little boy? We're awfully worried about him!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 sugimoto 01.ogg}} '''Sugimoto:''' Calm down, dear. We don't even know if he was taken here or not.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 02.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' B&mdash;but... Oh, my little Daisuke...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you must be Daisuke's parents!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 03.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' Yes, that's right! Have you seen him? Where is he? Is he all right?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Don't worry, he's safe and sound. Someone's looking after him now on Yashiori Island. Here, lemme show you on the map.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' He's been worried about you, I bet he'll be relieved to see you.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 04.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' You were the one who saved him? Oh, thank you, thank you!
:{{DIcon}} He's the one you should be thanking.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahaha, no need to thank me. It's my pleasure, really. It's just who I am... it's what I do.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Before you go calling me a hero, lemme ask you this: Wouldn't any other self-respecting guy who saw another person in danger have done the exact same thing?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really... Just one little compliment and it goes straight to his head...
:{{DIcon}} Why did they seize so many people?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 sugimoto 02.ogg}} '''Sugimoto:''' *sigh* These vagrants are insatiable. They'll do anything for money.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 sugimoto 05.ogg}} '''Sugimoto:''' No one dares stand up to them for fear of what they might do...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Would they really do anything drastic?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 sugimoto 06.ogg}} '''Sugimoto:''' Um... No, actually, because one of the guys &mdash; the one with oni horns on his head &mdash; has always shielded us so far.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 sugimoto 07.ogg}} '''Sugimoto:''' Oh, in fact, his horns look just like the ones this guy has!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 05.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' At night, he would secretly bring us food and water. I don't understand what he was trying to do...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 06.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' Are you a friend of his? Or perhaps a relative?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Uh, relative, I guess.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 07.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' Oh, maybe there's something secretly troubling him? He seemed different from the rest of the gang... They seem like heartless crooks, but I'd say he comes across more like a confused child who made some poor choices.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Lemme put it this way... There are a few things he needs to straighten out in his head, and I'm here to point him in the right direction.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 08.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' I'm glad to hear that. He's lucky to have family like you.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hehe, don't worry, he'll be in my trusty hands. I'll help him see the light.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Anyway, you should scram, it's still not safe here.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 misuzu 09.ogg}} '''Misuzu:''' Yes, thanks again. You've rescued our entire family... we are indebted to you.

:{{A|vo ydlq003 16 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Anyway, let's get going, while we still have time.

:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 02.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' Haha, so naive! This is my home turf!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 03.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' I'll let you in on a little secret. A long time ago, I picked up this rare paper charm. It's very precious to me.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 04.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' What makes it so special is that if you tear one piece, the other piece starts tearing too.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Uh, news flash, don't care about your little origami obsession.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 05.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' You'd better stay where you are and let me finish!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 06.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' Aren't you curious what the other piece is used for?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 07.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' I'll tell you. It's now the critical component of a mechanism, and when it gets torn, this place goes up in smoke! Yeah. The whole hideout is rigged with explosives and ready to blow.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wha&mdash; You're gonna blow this whole place up!?
:{{DIcon}} You'll get yourself killed too.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 08.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' Oh, don't worry about me. I made sure that I've got an escape route. The rest of you, though... you're gonna be buried deep among the rubble!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 09.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' You've had your fun. Now it's goodbye!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 10.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 11.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' My paper charm! Wh&mdash;Where's my paper charm!?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 01.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' I'm sorry, are you looking for this?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 12.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' Yes, that's&mdash; But when did you...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 02.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' I snatched it earlier, to stop you from doing anything hasty.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 13.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' Why you... And now you're going to betray me!?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 03.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' You're one to talk. What about burying everyone here? If you ask me, that sounds like you've already betrayed our agreement, no?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 14.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' Agh! Just give it here!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' You done talking now? You sure? Great, 'cause I am done listening.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 nogata 15.ogg}} '''Nogata:''' Ughhhh...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Great work, Takuya. You arrived in the nick of time.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 04.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Stay away from me!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 05.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' I said stay away, or I'll tear the paper charm!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey! Okay, okay... fine. Just calm down. What are you doing!?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 06.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Just because I won't let him blow this place to bits doesn't mean that I won't do it myself!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 07.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Unless you wanna get buried, then leave this place, now! Take everyone here and get out!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Heh, you won't go through with it.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' If you were that cruel, then why bother protecting every person you've come across, huh?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 08.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' I'm not here to reason with you! Go! Just get out of here!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 09.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' This sacrifice is mine to make, mine alone! Why couldn't you just stay out of it!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' No one needs to sacrifice themselves!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 10.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Alright, then you tell me, what am I supposed to do!?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 11.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' I've tarnished our oni pride and abandoned our ancestors' oath. Only sacrifice can restore my pride now!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 12.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' I chose this path so I could provide for my fellow oni. I was ready to die from the very beginning.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 13.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' This is between us blue oni! But you... If it wasn't for you, everything would have worked out perfectly!

:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 14.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Hey, Tenryou Commission! I'm the one you're looking for! I did it, I'm behind everything! Arataki Itto is innocent!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 15.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' You're the ones in charge of detaining criminals in human society, right? I'm sure you can tell who the criminal is here!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh! It's like he's trying to re-enact the fairytale! Sacrificing himself for the crimson oni...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ignore him, he doesn't know what he's talking about! It's me you've been looking for, and here I am! How're you ever going to report back without capturing me!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 16.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' Grr! Stop fooling around, Itto!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Listen Takuya, sacrificing yourself won't solve anything.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 11.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Your sacrifice can't protect me or your fellow oni. And giving up your life isn't gonna make theirs any longer.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 12.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Sacrificing yourself is one way to escape your fate, but the only one you'll be setting free is yourself.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 13.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Listen to me! You wanna be the tough guy, huh? Well, this is the coward's way out! Don't let your sacrifice stain our oni pride!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 takuya 17.ogg}} '''Takuya:''' ...
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 14.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' The blue oni have been scraping the bottom of the barrel all these years, so let's give them a new beginning.

:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 16.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Fate hasn't been kind to the oni? Well then, let's tear it up and start over!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 17.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' But before any of that can happen, you need to get yourself behind me and forget about all of that self-sacrifice stuff!
:{{A|vo ydlq003 18 itto 18.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Now, let's go. But we're not done talking about this. Takuya!!!

:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 sugimoto 02.ogg}} '''Sugimoto:''' It's time we started heading back. We'll be sure to visit again soon.
;(Sugimoto, Daisuke, Misuzu leave)
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 06.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' Ah, I'm glad that everything was resolved in the end. Things were looking quite dire, but now the future looks bright. Wonderful, wonderful.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 07.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' As for the blue oni, just leave them to me. If there's one thing an old granny like myself can do, it's caring for others.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you need our help?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 08.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' Haha, no, no. Go on ahead, I'm sure you have other adventures beckoning.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 09.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' Besides, once Itto is released, he'll be here to help me.
:{{DIcon}} Is he always like this?
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 10.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' Oh, yes... And you know what, I think that's what makes him adorable, wouldn't you agree? Hehe.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 11.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' He does whatever he puts his mind to... He's sincere, brave, and determined.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 12.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' Back when I took him in, everyone thought I was most unusual indeed. They started calling me Granny Oni.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 13.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' But I've never been ashamed of this name. On the contrary, I'm quite proud of it.
:{{A|vo ydlq003 20 onibaaya 14.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' Because Itto is my pride and joy.

;(A [[#Cinematic|cinematic]] starts)
::A long, long time ago, in a village lost to time
::There lived a crimson oni and a blue oni
::They were the best of friends
::The crimson oni wanted to be friends with the humans
::So the blue oni played the role of the naughty kid...
::And then he left
::After a long time, the crimson oni was living happily with the humans
::But in his heart, he wanted to bring the blue oni back home
::The crimson oni didn't know where to find the blue oni
::His search took him up the highest mountains
::And across the widest rivers
::He found many traces of the blue oni
::But the more he found, the clearer it became:
::The blue oni was hiding on purpose
::So just as the blue oni had once done, the crimson oni left him a letter:
::"Dear [[Ao]], I've made lots of human friends now"
::"And I want to have a big party for everyone"
::"I want all my friends to be there. That means you too, Ao"
::"If you don't want to meet me, you can just watch from a distance"
::The blue oni snuck back to the village, and hid in the shadows
::He saw the great feast and roaring fire, and longed to join in
::But though his stomach rumbled
::The blue oni remembered the oath of old, and kept his distance
::Suddenly, he jumped: The crimson oni was right behind him!
::"Hey, you're finally back!"
::"C'mon, I'll introduce you!"
::"It's time everyone met my best friend"

:{{A|vo dialog ydlq003 onibaaya 01.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' Just leave everything to me now.
:{{A|vo dialog ydlq003 onibaaya 02.ogg}} '''Granny Oni:''' It looks like Granny Oni's about to get a few more oni to look after.
