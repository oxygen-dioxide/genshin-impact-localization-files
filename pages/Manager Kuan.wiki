==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yiran:''' Manager Kuan! I want to buy a kite!
:'''Manager Kuan:''' How many times do I have to tell you, just call me "Daddy." Now, if you study hard, Daddy will buy you one, alright?
:'''Yiran:''' No! Aren't you the shift supervisor of the Blackcliff Forge, Manager Kuan? As the supervisor, it's up to you to set an example.
:'''Manager Kuan:''' But Daddy has to work, and you have to study. These are two completely differ&mdash;
:'''Yiran:''' Then let's talk about work! "Let our actions be recognized by hard work. Let our achievements be what speaks first." Isn't that right?
:'''Manager Kuan:''' That's right, that's the Blackcliff Forge motto... How'd you remember that so clearly?
:'''Yiran:''' So let's start from your actions. If you buy me the kite, Manager Kuan, then I will recognize your hard work!
:'''Manager Kuan:''' How many times do I have to say it &mdash; I'm "Daddy"! And how did this suddenly become about me? It's like you're trapping me in...
:'''Yiran:''' You're the one that started talking about work, aren't you?
:'''Manager Kuan:''' *sigh* Alright, then. I'll buy you a kite. But from now on, you must call me "Daddy."
:'''Yiran:''' Alright, "Daddy"! Now, Daddy! Do as you promised!

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yiran:''' Manager Kuan! I don't want a kite, I want a Xiao Lantern!
:'''Manager Kuan:''' How many times do I have to tell you, just call me "Daddy."
:'''Manager Kuan:''' If you want a Xiao Lantern, then we can just release one together. Now, if you want to write a wish on the lantern, just tell me and I'll...
:'''Yiran:''' No way! Your handwriting is terrible, Manager Kuan. If you write it, our wish will never come true!
:'''Manager Kuan:''' Ah, child, how could you ever be so cold to your Daddy...
:'''Yiran:''' But aren't you the one who taught me to always be honest about what's on my mind?
:'''Yiran:''' And since I know that your handwriting is absolutely terrible, wouldn't I be disobeying if I told you it's fine for you to write?
:'''Manager Kuan:''' *sigh* Fine, you're right... I'll buy you a lantern... But from now on, you must call me "Daddy."
:'''Yiran:''' Alright, "Daddy"! Now, Daddy! Do as you promised!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yiran:''' Manager Kuan! I want the moon!
:'''Manager Kuan:''' Hey, aren't each of your requests becoming less reasonable than the last? Also, for the last time, just call me "Daddy."
:'''Yiran:''' Nope. Also, my requests are not that unreasonable.
:'''Yiran:''' Isn't the Moonchase Festival all about chasing the moon? If you can get it for me, Manager Kuan, then no one will have to chase it.
:'''Yiran:''' That would make you everyone's hero, Manager Kuan!
:'''Manager Kuan:''' I'm not some hero, I'm just Kuan... No, wait,  I'm your Daddy!
:'''Yiran:''' Well, if you're my Daddy, and then you can fulfill my wishes, right? I'll study hard, and you'll get me the moon. That's fair, right?
:'''Manager Kuan:''' I don't think this is a question of fairness. It's more that... I can't get the moon in the first place.
:'''Yiran:''' *sigh* Then until you get the moon, you're not a hero, you're Manager Kuan.
