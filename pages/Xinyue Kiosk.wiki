{{Lang|'''Xinyue Kiosk'''|zh=新月轩|zh_rm=Xīnyuè-xuān|zh_tl=New Moon Pavilion}} is a famous restaurant in [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Liyue]]. It is located across from [[Mingxing Jewelry]], entered by approaching the door next to [[Yueshu]]. The upstairs part of the restaurant is located across from [[Northland Bank]] and upstairs from [[Heyu Tea House]], though there is no way to go between them from inside the restaurant.

Xinyue Kiosk is renowned as the most authentic restaurant for Yue cuisine, just as [[Liuli Pavilion]] is to Li cuisine. As a result, Xinyue Kiosk's dishes are primarily seafood based, which is Yue cuisine's specialty. Francis mentions [[Crystal Shrimp]], [[Golden Crab]], and [[Fullmoon Egg]] among the restaurant's menu offerings.

Due to its high reputation, Xinyue Kiosk is rather expensive to dine at and has a three-month waitlist.

During {{Quest|Know Thyself, Know Thy Enemy}}, [[Gentry Maocai]] meets with a [[Fatui Pyro Agent]] at Xinyue Kiosk.
