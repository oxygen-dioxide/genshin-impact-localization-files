|description = A curious creature that loves phlogiston and dances around flames. Just as bees are "brewers" that use pollen, Phlogiston Aphids are also known as "chefs" of phlogiston due to their own special organs &mdash; in the eyes of some creatures of Natlan that make use of phlogiston, phlogiston processed by Phlogiston Aphids is simply more delicious. Should there be a large concentration of Phlogiston Aphids gathered somewhere in the wild, that means high-quality phlogiston may be found there. Some "[[Masters of the Night-Wind]]" Phlogiston Engravers will raise Phlogiston Aphids specifically to pre-process the phlogiston they use...

'''Phlogiston Aphid''' is a type of [[Wildlife]] that can be found in [[Natlan]].

Phlogiston Aphids will flee (very slowly) when approached, but will not despawn unless attacked. They will generate 2 [[Phlogiston]] Particles if caught, or 1 Phlogiston Particle if killed.

When [[Varesa]] is in her Sudden Onrush state or when [[Iansan]] is in her Rushing Thunderbolt state, simply touching a Phlogiston Aphid will generate 1 Phlogiston Particle. This will cause it to despawn, but it will respawn after the area is reloaded.

Catching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[archive]].

==Locations==
Phlogiston Aphids can be found in Phlogiston-rich areas.

See the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=625 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

==Lore==
Phlogiston Aphids have a defense system similar to mollusks; they ingest foreign irritants (such as [[Abyss]]al energy) and encase them in layers of [[Phlogiston]], turning them into Phlogiston Honey Pearls. This effectively neutralizes the irritant.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Aphid Treasure}}</ref> 

This processing also changes the characteristics of the Phlogiston, making it more desirable for humans and other creatures alike. For instance, humans value Phlogiston Pearls as gemstones for their beauty. Pearls with a deeper red color are considered more valuable.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Scarlet Phlogiston Honey Pearl}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Phlogiston Aphids were featured in the [[Aphid Treasure Trace]] event in [[Version 5.1]].
** Consuming too much Abyssal energy would kill a Phlogiston Aphid, but consuming a small amount only makes them increase in size.
** Phlogiston Aphids are intelligent enough to use their ability to contain contamination to gradually remove Abyssal corruption from their environment.
