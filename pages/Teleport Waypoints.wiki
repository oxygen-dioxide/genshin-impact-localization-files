{{Description|Odd devices that are scattered across Teyvat, seemingly forming a certain order. People on the continent see them as ancient gimmicks &mdash; they are accustomed to their existence despite not knowing their purpose. To the foreign [[traveler]], however, their function becomes quite apparent.}}

Players can find and unlock '''Teleport Waypoints''' throughout the world of [[Teyvat]]. When a player first unlocks them they are granted {{Item|Adventure EXP|30|x=50}} and {{Item|Primogem|30|x=5}}. Clicking on a Teleport Waypoint on the [[Map]] offers to fast travel to their location.

As of [[Version/2.6|Version 2.6]], there are 169 Teleport Waypoints in Teyvat.

Any [[Statue of The Seven]] or [[Domain]], including Event Domains, also acts as a Waypoint and can be fast traveled to. Players can refer to [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=3 Teyvat Interactive Map] for their locations.

Certain significant locations also act as teleport waypoints:
{| class="fandom-table"
!Location
!Completed quest requirement to unlock
|-
|[[Alcor]]
|[[A Lone Ship In Guyun]]
|-
|[[Jade Chamber]]
|[[The Crane Returns on the Wind]]
|}

==Overview==
In addition to allowing fast travel, Teleport Waypoints also:
* Serve as respawn locations after a player's party dies.
** Only unlocked Teleport Waypoints can do this.
** In Co-Op Mode, the player is teleported to the nearest Teleport Waypoint that they have unlocked in their own world, even if the host has not unlocked it.
* Serve as [[sources of warmth]] in [[Subzero Climate]]s, such as in [[Dragonspine]].
* Recharge the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]]'s energy in [[The Chasm]].

==Unlocking==
Most Teleport Waypoints need to be unlocked by interacting with them. The location of most locked Waypoints can be seen on the [[Map]] once the area they are in is lit up, which is done by touching a [[Statue of The Seven]] on the Map of Teyvat and through other means, such as quest progression, in other maps. A navigation pointer will indicate a locked Teleport Waypoint's direction on the screen if the player is within 40 meters{{Verify|30, 40, or 50?}} of it.

===Additional Prerequisites===
Some Teleport Waypoints do not show up on the Map when locked, even when the area they are in is lit up, until another requirement is completed:

==Portable Waypoints==
{{Main|Portable Waypoint}}
'''Portable Waypoints''' are items that function similarly to Teleport Waypoints, except they can be summoned and placed anywhere by the user and only last a set amount of time.

==Sub-Space Waypoints==
{{Main|Sub-Space Waypoint}}
'''Sub-Space Waypoints''' are [[furnishing]]s that function similarly to Teleport Waypoints. They can be placed anywhere in a player's [[Serenitea Pot]].

==Corrupted Waypoints==
{{Main|Corrupted Waypoints}}
'''Corrupted Waypoints''' are waypoints shrouded in darkness lose their original functionality. Unlocking them requires specialized materials. They are only available during the "[[Three Realms Gateway Offering#Rite of Diffusal|Three Realms Gateway Offering]]" event.

==Temporary Teleport Waypoints==
Some Teleport Waypoints were introduced in [[Event]]-exclusive areas, and therefore were only accessible for limited amount of time.
* There were 7 Teleport Waypoints located in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]], which was only accessible during [[Version 1.6]].
** Four of these Teleport Waypoints acted like [[Statues of The Seven]] in the way that they lit up parts of the map.
** One of these Waypoints was automatically unlocked with the Golden Apple Archipelago map tab, which was itself unlocked either by playing [[Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown]] until [[Dvalin]] transports you there, or automatically unlocked after [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] ends.
* There were 10 Teleport Waypoints located in the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering/Area|Three Realms Gateway Offering]] Event Area, which was only accessible during [[Version 2.5]].
** Nine of these were originally [[Corrupted Waypoints|corrupted]] and required 5 [[Tokoyo Legume]] and 5 [[Aphotium Ore]] to unlock.

==Lore==
The canonicity of Teleport Waypoints is unclear.

The item description, map description, and existence of Portable Waypoints suggest that Teleport Waypoints are at least understood as teleportation devices and that only their inner workings are unknown.

This conflicts with the Teleport Waypoint description, which says that the people of Teyvat do not even know the purpose of the Teleport Waypoints and only view them as "ancient gimmicks."

This, in turn, conflicts with the Event Quest ''[[Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown]]'', during which Paimon, Barbara, and Jean display no recognition of the first Teleport Waypoint "device" they encounter on the Golden Apple Archipelago. Paimon even compares the "device" to a Portable Waypoint. This is incongruous due to the presence of numerous identical Teleport Waypoints throughout Mondstadt, including one in the city's main plaza that is on its own platform on grass and has its own path paved to it.

===Katheryne===
Given the likely unusual circumstances surrounding Katheryne as well as her prominent role in gameplay affairs, the information she gives about teleportation must be considered separately.

[[Katheryne]] in Inazuma asks the Traveler, "I thought you knew how to use Teleport Waypoints?" during ''[[Katheryne in Inazuma]]'', the quest that unlocks [[Commissions]] in [[Inazuma]]. This question was asked after she claimed to be joking about using a teleportation tool.

Katheryne in Liyue, who had previously told the Traveler that she would be waiting for them on Narukami Island during ''[[Setting Sail]]'', later claimed to have drawn a fortune slip at "the shrine," presumably in Inazuma, during ''[[In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion]]''. At Paimon's surprise, Katheryne explained that she, too, has a private life.

The suggestion that all Katherynes are the same and can also teleport or otherwise engage in fast travel is a departure from ''[[New Horizons of Adventure]]'', the quest that unlocks Commissions in [[Liyue]], which suggests that all Katherynes look alike but are separate entities.

==Trivia==
* A message stating "Teleport Waypoint unlocked" appears when interacting with a Teleport Waypoint, common [[Domain]] entrance or [[Statue of The Seven]] for the first time, although this message may also appear in other cases:
** After completing Quests which unlocks access to a Domain as a reward.
** After completing certain [[Archon Quest]] steps, which does not actually unlock any location that the player may choose to teleport to, but instead acts as a checkpoint where the party will be revived if all the characters [[Fallen Characters|fall]], similarly to a [[Door of Resurrection]].
* [[Tsurumi Island]]'s [[fog]] prevents the usage of its Teleport Waypoints by hiding them on the [[Map]], even if the player previously unlocked them. They will however be accessible again after the fog is cleared without requiring to be unlocked again.
* The Teleport Waypoint near the east of [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], [[Enkanomiya]], currently has the furthest distance between the waypoint and the players' actual spawn location when compared to other Teleport Waypoints.
* There is an upside-down Teleport Waypoint in [[Nameless Ruins]], [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] that cannot be unlocked normally if players are standing at the ground level.
* The shape of Teleport Waypoint icons in Genshin Impact appear to be similar to {{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'s open-world game mode.
