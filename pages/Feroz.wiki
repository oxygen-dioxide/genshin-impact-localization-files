==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Feroz:''' Huh, little beetle, where do you come from?
:{{DIcon}} Little beetle...
::'''Feroz:''' Yeah, a little beetle. Even smaller than the tiniest golden scarab.
::'''Feroz:''' Look at you, as thin as a stick. If you dare travel to the desert, you'll surely get crushed by the huge trunks and rocks left by [[Scarlet King|King Deshret]].
::'''Feroz:''' Take my advice, hire a capable bodyguard, or stay where people are, away from the desert!
:{{DIcon}} Rotten [[Ajilenakh Nuts]]...
::'''Feroz:''' You heard that? Don't worry about it. I wasn't talking about you.
::'''Feroz:''' I was talking about the hateful smugglers and those rattling about "resurrecting King Deshret." Dimwits!
::'''Feroz:''' Like Ajilenakh Nuts rotting in the sand, they are sticky and annoying.
::'''Feroz:''' It would be a relief to all of us if the stupid [[Akademiya]] were to take them down!
::'''Feroz:''' Bringing this up with the [[Navbed]] is no use, they just beat around the bush.
::'''Feroz:''' It seems that wine is the only thing they wouldn't skirt around!
::{{DIcon}} "Resurrecting King Deshret"?
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::'''Feroz:''' Foolish idea!
:::'''Feroz:''' Toying with life and death is a futile endeavor!
:::'''Feroz:''' If the King Deshret could rise from the sands, so could [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] sprout from the soil!
:::'''Feroz:''' The King Deshret is long gone. Those wannabes don't deserve the title of the Eremites if they can't even face it!
:::'''Feroz:''' Death is the fairest thing in the world. A god high above or a bug deep in dirt, it comes for everyone all the same.
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Feroz:''' Pfft. A foolish notion!
:::'''Feroz:''' Toying with life and death is a futile endeavor!
:::'''Feroz:''' If King Deshret would so easily rise up from a pile of sand and dust, could little sprouts that have just broken the soil not immediately grow into monumental trees?
:::'''Feroz:''' King Deshret is long gone. Those wannabes claim the name of the Eremites in vain if they can't even face up to that fact!
:::'''Feroz:''' Death is the fairest thing in the world. Whether a god high above or a bug down in dirt, it comes for everyone all the same.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Feroz:''' I'm a mercenary from [[Aaru Village]]. If you're asking about the local nonsense, go annoy someone else.
::'''Feroz:''' It's a heck of a place, but at least life is better here than in Aaru Village.
::'''Feroz:''' Otherwise who would have come all the way here to work for the darn Akademiya? I'm not stupid!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Feroz:''' Let's go.
