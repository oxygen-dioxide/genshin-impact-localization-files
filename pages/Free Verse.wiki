{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the pier)
:'''???:''' "Hey, diddle diddle."
:'''???:''' "The cat and the fiddle, the fish jumped over the moon."
:'''Cat With a Black Hat:''' Meow&mdash;Meow!

;(Talk to the girl)
:'''???:''' "The little dog laughed to see such fun, and the dish ran away with the spoon."
:'''Dog in a Dress:''' Woof?
:'''Paimon:''' Someone's singing here. Should we say hello?
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:'''???:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Should Paimon speak louder? Hello...?
:'''???:''' Oh.
:'''Cat With a Black Hat:''' Meow, meow meow.
:'''Dog in a Dress:''' Woof, woof!
:'''???:''' Okay, alright, I got it. Greetings... friends from afar.
:'''???:''' Welcome to... our party. Please take a seat.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, she looks very shy. Did we startle her?
:{{DIcon}} Let's tone it down a bit.
:{{DIcon}} Let's be careful when we speak.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon got you. We'll take a... Wait, Paimon's not seeing any seats!
:'''Dog in a Dress:''' Woof, woof.
:'''Cat With a Black Hat:''' Meow, meow-meow-meow-meow, meow!
:'''???:''' Oh, it's okay, Nana, it's not necessary.
:'''???:''' Mr. Quijano is right, we don't need to follow any awful rules. We just need cookies and bones.
:'''Dog in a Dress:''' Woof... woof-woof, woof-woof... Arwoo.
:'''Paimon:''' Are you talking to the puppy?
:'''???:''' No, not a puppy. This is... Lady Nana.
:'''???:''' Anyway, that's it for the pre-meal speech. Time to raise a toast!
:{{DIcon}} I don't see cups, either.
::'''Paimon:''' Neither does Paimon... Guess we'll just roll with it.
:{{DIcon}} Let us raise a glass in our minds.
::'''Paimon:''' Always flexible no matter how weird the situation is, huh?
::'''Paimon:''' In that case... let us raise a glass in our heads!
:'''???:''' To all the gears, muskets, and math books!
:'''Cat With a Black Hat:''' Meow!
:'''Dog in a Dress:''' Woof!
:{{DIcon}} Meow!
:{{DIcon}} Woof!
:'''Paimon:''' Should Paimon meow or woof along? Fine... Woof!
:'''Dog in a Dress:''' Woof! Woof, woof! Woof!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, did Paimon woof wrong...? This hasn't felt right since the start.
:'''Paimon:''' Can someone translate their woofs and meows, please?
:'''Cat With a Black Hat:''' Meow, meow-meow.
:'''???:''' Sorry, you're right. As the party host, that was my negligence. I should've introduced myself first.
:'''Penny:''' Penny is my name. The furry gentleman with the black hat here is Don Quijano, a swashbuckler.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Meow.
:'''Penny:''' And this is Nana, a particularly elegant and very considerate lady.
:'''Nana:''' {{Rubi|Yip-yip, woo-woof.|Thanks for saying that, Sweetheart.|center=1}} {{Rubi|Woof woof.|Pleased to meet you.|center=1}}
:{{DIcon}} Am I imagining things?
:{{DIcon}} Was that dog speaking?
:{{DIcon}} Can't say I've never seen things like this before, but still...
:'''Paimon:''' Why are you mumbling? It's our turn to introduce ourselves! This child seems to be talking to imaginary animal friends. Shouldn't we roll with it?
:'''Penny:''' No, Lady Nana and Mr. Quijano are not imaginary, and they can speak.
:'''Paimon:''' Oops, she heard us.
:'''Penny:''' May I tell them a little bit about you, Lady Nana? Just a little, or they won't understand what you'll say.
:'''Nana:''' Woof.
:'''Penny:''' Okay! Lady Nana is from the Court of Fontaine. She has a nice surname, Le...
:'''Nana:''' *whine*
:'''Penny:''' I won't bring that up, then, good Nana. Sorry to hurt your feelings.
:'''Penny:''' I'll just mention the happy part. Nana's best pal is the purple-eyed [[Autumn]].
:'''Penny:''' Miss Autumn is a genuine lady. She'd change Nana's outfit many times a day.
:'''Penny:''' Nana wore a different dress to sleep, meals, afternoon teas, balls, walks, and even dates, with different accessories.
:'''Penny:''' Then, the purple-eyed Autumn left home. Nana wandered here with her and became friends with us.
:'''Penny:''' Now, would you mind, Mr. Quijano?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Meow, meow.
:'''Penny:''' Okay, I'll also just tell them a little bit about you.
:'''Penny:''' Sorry, Mr. Quijano is still wanted by the [[Maison Gardiennage]] to this day, so I can't say much at all &mdash; for your own good, of course.
:'''Penny:''' Years ago, when Mr. Quijano was adventuring with his buddies... Oh, that would be [[Rouge]] and the blind man [[Freeman]].
:'''Penny:''' They were pursued by hired hitmen to [[Poisson]]. They ran out of everything except the three goons on their tail.
:'''Penny:''' That was when Mr. Quijano charged in and saved them... What was it that you said at the time, Mr. Quijano?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Meow-meow-meow, meow-meow meow.
:'''Penny:''' Right. He said, "My fine friends, I love you with all my heart, but it's time to say goodbye. We'll meet again six feet under."
:'''Penny:''' He thought he'd never make it, so he lunged in alone and drove all three bad guys away!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, then he must be a master of the sword!
:'''Penny:''' Hehe, you believe it now, don't you?
:'''Penny:''' Rouge once said that you have to use your head, not your ears, to truly get what others are saying.
:'''Penny:''' If you still don't get it, just close your eyes and listen with your head.
:{{Black Screen|The girl's words are full of fantasies, but you don't think it would hurt to go with the flow.}}
:'''Penny:''' Keep your eyes closed a bit longer. If you're bored, I'll sing a song for you. Mr. Quijano and Lady Nana often sing it along with me.
:'''Penny:''' "Hey, diddle diddle."
:'''Penny:''' "The cat and the fiddle, the fish jumped over the moon."
:'''Penny:''' "The little dog laughed to see such fun, and the dish ran away with the spoon."
:{{Black Screen|It seems the girl has always been singing by the river with but a cat and a dog for company...}}
:{{Black Screen|No wonder they're so close to each other. What would they say?}}
:{{Black Screen|You meditate on that for a while...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, {{Traveler}}, Paimon's not feeling any different, but should we try to speak with the cat and the dog?

;(Talk to Penny, optional)
:'''Penny:''' You have to use your head, not your ears, to truly get what others are saying.

;(Approach Don Quijano and Nana)
:'''Don Quijano:''' Meow! Meow-meow, meowr.
:'''Paimon:''' What are you saying? {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s not stupid. Don't you talk bad about {{Traveler}}!
:{{DIcon}} You understood that, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, it just came to Paimon without any effort.
:{{DIcon}} That's probably because you're practically a child.
::'''Paimon:''' What? Are you calling Paimon immature?
:{{DIcon}} You're getting smarter, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Why, of course... Wait, no, Paimon was smart to begin with! Are you doubting Paimon's intelligence?
:'''Nana:''' {{Rubi|Woof, awoo, woof-woof-woof.|It's because she listens from the heart.|center=1}}
:{{DIcon}} I can understand now!
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:'''Nana:''' {{Rubi|Awoo,|Hello,}} {{Rubi|woof-woof woof.|friends from afar.|center=1}}
:'''Paimon:''' How did you know we came from far away? Can you not only speak, but tell the future just like [[Mona]] too?
:'''Don Quijano:''' {{Rubi|Mrow &mdash; meow, purr,|"Friends from afar" is a common greeting,|center=1}} {{Rubi|meow-meow meow.|friends from afar.|center=1}}
:'''Paimon:''' Oh.
:{{DIcon}} So everything Penny said is true?
:'''Nana:''' {{Rubi|Arw-arw-arwoo arwoo, woo,|I did use to live in the Court of Fontaine,|center=1}} {{Rubi|woof-woof-woof, arwoo.|such wonderful memories.|center=1}}
:'''Nana:''' {{Rubi|Awoo,|I suppose,|center=1}} my old friends are still mingling regularly at the [[Hotel Debord]].
:'''Nana:''' Heh, I would often accompany Autumn to such soirees at the Hotel, and oh, how we danced!
:'''Nana:''' We wouldn't stop dancing, not even when the band grew tired!
:'''Nana:''' Whether or not you believe me, it is all little more than a memory for me now.
:'''Nana:''' For now, Autumn has found her calling, and I have found mine. I wish only for her happiness, from the bottom of my heart.
:'''Nana:''' And Rouge has accepted me, so in the end, I stay here by choice.
:'''Paimon:''' She's fully immersed in her memory, huh.
:'''Paimon:''' Rouge... Penny mentioned that name. Who is he?
:'''Nana:''' He is a graceful gentleman.
:'''Don Quijano:''' And he is Penny's guardian, as well as our friend.
:'''Nana:''' Very fun to be with.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Adept at archery, and knows a thing or two about swords. An outstanding young man.
:'''Nana:''' Don't dabble in dangerous deeds, Quijano, or you'll get yourself killed.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Worry not, Nana, a gremlin once foretold that I shall not die so easily.
:'''Don Quijano:''' The prophecy says that when at last I tire of adventuring, a respectable and adorable girl shall appear.
:'''Don Quijano:''' And in her, I shall find my purpose for all my remaining days. And I shall dedicate all that I have and am to ensuring she never comes to harm.
:'''Don Quijano:''' That child is Penny. But how can I best protect her?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Were I a knight, and not a swashbuckler, I would know how. Alas, I am not.
:'''Paimon:''' A knight? You have one right in front of you! {{Traveler}} is an honorary knight of the [[Knights of Favonius]]!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Oh, my! To think I should encounter a true knight!
:{{DIcon}} So...
:{{DIcon}} Pretty admirable, right?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Then, allow me one presumptuous request...
:'''Nana:''' I suppose we have the same idea.
:'''Paimon:''' Heh, although there's basically nothing we, the legendary adventurer duo, {{Traveler}} and Paimon, can't do, our time is quite valuable and carries a cost.
:{{DIcon}} Why don't we figure out some charging plans when we have time?
:'''Nana:''' I'd be willing to spend all of my jewels to hire a knight, so, if you could...
:'''Don Quijano:''' Please become friends with Penny.
:{{DIcon}} Huh?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Our dear Penny stands at a fork in the road. She knows not whether to grow up, or remain a child.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Her body is still growing, and she grows bigger by the day.
:'''Nana:''' She is growing mentally as well, and her heart grows more complicated by the day.
:'''Don Quijano:''' What do a cat and a dog know of such strange human things? But it should be easy for a knight.
:'''Nana:''' We need to find a knight to be Penny's friend. Perhaps then, she can find the answers.
:{{DIcon}} You're very good to Penny.
:'''Don Quijano:''' She's the best child in the world.
:'''Nana:''' No one loves her more than I do.
:'''Nana:''' Please be Penny's friend! I offer you all my necklaces and satin dresses.
:'''Don Quijano:''' You have my word, that I shall protect you with mine own life should the need arise.
:'''Don Quijano:''' The gems from [[Liyue]] traders may be priceless, but Don Quijano's promises are more precious still.
:{{DIcon}} How do I become her friend, then?
:'''Nana:''' You will!?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to be little Penny's friend too!
:'''Don Quijano:''' My dear friends, herehence, you are "friends from afar" no longer.
:'''Don Quijano:''' From the moment you asked that question, you became "dear friends."
:'''Nana:''' This is wonderful! So wonderful! Let us tell Penny the good news.

;(Talk to Nana and Don Quijano again, optional)
:'''Don Quijano:''' From the moment you asked that question, you became "dear friends."
:'''Nana:''' Let's go tell Penny the good news.

;(Talk to Penny)
:'''Nana:''' Penny, my dear, you shall have two new friends.
:'''Don Quijano:''' The legendary adventurer duo, {{Traveler}} and Paimon, are willing to be our friends.
:'''Penny:''' Really? Haha, awesome! I have so many friends now!
:'''Nana:''' Let's have a ceremony to commemorate this.
:'''Don Quijano:''' The ceremony requires a speech. But alas! We lack the time to write a proper one.
:'''Nana:''' Don't worry. Just keep it simple.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Very well, then I shall make this brief. Please, come forward.
:'''Paimon:''' This should do it.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Ladies and gentlemen, I hereby declare...
:'''Don Quijano:''' Penny, friend to the children, Don Quijano the Swashbuckler, and Lady Nana, hereby welcome Paimon and...
:'''Don Quijano:''' Ah, just a moment. How should I introduce you two?
:'''Paimon:''' You mean Paimon's title? You can call Paimon the Best Guide in Teyvat!
:'''Paimon:''' And let's use Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius for {{MC|m=him|f=her}}, though {{MC|m=his|f=her}} other titles are awesome too.
:'''Penny:''' No, no, no. That's not what Mr. Quijano is asking.
:'''Nana:''' We need to know who your friends are.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Every one of us, cats and dogs, are bound together by the bonds of friendship.
:'''Nana:''' A life bereft of friendship... Oh! Such a life would be too horrible. So, who are your friends?
:{{DIcon}} A deity that oversees a whole nation.
::'''Don Quijano:''' Good. Penny always brings delicious food. And so, she is also a deity. The Goddess of Biscuits and Bones.
::'''Nana:''' Then, my dear friends, from now on, you shall have one more deity friend.
:{{DIcon}} Government officials and wealthy people.
::'''Nana:''' Oh, deary me! Those are the only friends you have? It's okay. You have us now.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon is my best friend.
::'''Paimon:''' You are also Paimon's best friend!
::'''Don Quijano:''' Aha! So you are a pair of good friends. Wonderful!
::'''Nana:''' I can see that Paimon is a truly great friend!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Good. In the name of all the bearings, cakes, and storybooks&mdash;
:'''Don Quijano:''' Penny, Paimon, and {{Traveler}} are now good friends.
:'''Don Quijano:''' You will share all your bones, biscuits, and picture books, and say "good night" to each other before you go to sleep.
:'''Nana:''' Play in the mud together, scare birds together, and count stars together!
:'''Penny:''' Woohoo!
:'''Paimon:''' Woohoo!
:{{DIcon}} Woohoo!
:'''Penny:''' Now, we're all friends... But wait, the two of you haven't met the children yet.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Gosh! We almost forgot the children.
:'''Nana:''' Strange. I haven't seen them all day.
:'''Penny:''' The children are our friends, too. You two should meet them.
:'''Nana:''' You're right. Please go meet the children. Let them know you are their new friends.
:'''Don Quijano:''' They probably went somewhere far away to play. It's high time they returned. Go into the water and have a look.
:'''Penny:''' Don't worry, just go underwater. You needn't fret about the children not wanting to come back. I'll sing a song to send you along.
:'''Penny:''' The children will come back to sleep in their [[Huge Shell|big shells]] when they hear my song, so head over to the big shell and wish them sweet dreams.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' That sure is a unique friend, who loves taking to themselves so much. But Paimon doesn't mind.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go to that big shell Penny mentioned and look for the "children."

;(Talk to Penny, Nana, and Don Quijano again, optional)
:'''Don Quijano:''' What song would you like to sing, Penny?
:'''Penny:''' How about a lullaby?
:'''Nana:''' Oh, I love lullabies.
----
;(While heading toward the first shell)
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' Rock a bye, baby, on seaweed-top.
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' When the flow combs,
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' The cradle will rock.

;(Approach the first shell)
:;(The shell opens)
:'''"Children":''' Bubble bubble, Penny is singing, bubble bubble.
:'''Paimon:''' So, the "children" Penny was talking about are fish!
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, there. We're Penny's new friends, Paimon and {{Traveler}}.
:'''"Children":''' Bubble bubble, new friends? New friends... New friends!
:'''"Children":''' Bubble bubble! Sweet dreams, new friends!
:'''Paimon:''' Sweet dreams! Well, they seem happy. Now that we've met them, let's go to the next shell.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' If the stem breaks, the cradle will fall.
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' Yet I will catch you, cradle and all.
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' Baby is drowsing, cosy and fair,
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' I sing a lullaby, oh baby hear:

;(Approach the second shell)
:;(The shell opens)
:'''"Children":''' Bubble bubble, can't find. Bubble bubble, can't find!
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, there. We're Penny's new friends, Paimon and {{Traveler}}.
:'''"Children":''' Bubble bubble, new friends! Bubble bubble, old friends... can't find!
:'''"Children":''' Bubble bubble... Penny is singing, bubble bubble... Sleepy...
:'''Paimon:''' They seem to have lost something. Strange... But we should be done here, so let's head over to the next shell first.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' Forward and back the cradle she swings,
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' The baby sleeps,
:'''Singing Voice from the Shore:''' They hear what she sings.

;(Approach the third shell)
:'''Paimon:''' There's nothing here... Where are the "children"?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That's a Fatui insignia!
:'''Paimon:''' The "children" are gone, and there's only a Fatui insignia left inside the shell! We have to tell Penny about this!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Old Insignia (Free Verse)|text=Old Insignia}})
----
;(Approach Penny)
:'''Paimon:''' Penny, we just met the "children" underwater.
:'''Penny:''' How did it go? Did you become pals?
:{{DIcon}} I would call it a friendly-enough encounter.
:{{DIcon}} We're pals now!
:'''Paimon:''' Penny, some of them went missing.
:'''Paimon:''' We found this in their cradles. {{Traveler}}, if you would.
:{{DIcon}} This is a Fatui insignia.
:'''Penny:''' What...!?
:'''Paimon:''' You probably don't know this, but the Fatui are a bunch of very, very bad guys. They might have kidnapped the "children."
:'''Paimon:''' But don't you worry, we'll help you, since we're friends now.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Bad guys?
:'''Penny:''' Are you saying that [[Kerek]] is a bad guy?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Kerek? Who or what is that?
:'''Nana:''' Kerek oft sings with Penny. I once recommended he try his luck at the Opera Epiclese.
:'''Don Quijano:''' He does have a nice voice.
:'''Nana:''' He would go underwater to play with the children as well.
:'''Don Quijano:''' That's right. Kerek is a swimmer most swift. I admire him greatly.
:'''Paimon:''' So, you mean there's a Fatuus named Kerek who is Penny's friend, and who left this mark behind?
:'''Penny:''' I think so. This belongs to Kerek. He's our pal.
:'''Paimon:''' Really? Maybe we misunderstood.
:'''Penny:''' What are Fatui, anyway?
:{{DIcon}} A bunch of guys who love to pull dirty deeds.
:{{DIcon}} A bunch of guys who see things differently than most people.
:'''Paimon:''' Some in the Fatui love to use others and do bad things. They've opposed us loads of times.
:'''Penny:''' So is Kerek very bad? Does he do a lot of dirty deeds?
:'''Don Quijano:''' I can smell scoundrels from a mile away. But Kerek had not the stench of ill-will about him.
:'''Nana:''' But if our dear friends say he may be just such a person...
:'''Nana:''' Oh! I understand. Perhaps Kerek was once bad, but has since turned over a new leaf.
:'''Don Quijano:''' There is also the possibility... that he is both good and bad.
:'''Nana:''' Oh! You are quite correct. One can be both bad and good.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Just like a person can enjoy both dainty little cakes and raw seafood.
:'''Nana:''' Raw seafood... Ugh... Only the worst of the worst eat that kind of thing.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Come now, Nana. Raw seafood isn't that bad.
:'''Nana:''' Wrong. I shall never touch the stuff.
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, if Fatui didn't kidnap the "children," where did they go...?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Oh, don't worry. The little troublemakers often run off on their own. They'll be back soon enough.
:'''Nana:''' Penny, what's on your mind? Why are you zoning out?
:'''Penny:''' Good guys and bad guys... That sounds complicated, like math. Like, what do you get when you add one good guy and one bad guy together...?
:{{Black Screen|Penny spreads her fingers and frowns in deep thought but to no avail.}}
:{{Black Screen|She takes out a math book and scribbles... Again, to no avail.}}
:'''Penny:''' Hmm, I can't figure this out. I haven't gotten to this part of math yet. I'll ask Autumn when she gets back.
:'''Don Quijano:''' You must learn from an adult like Autumn, Penny. Adults know the answers to questions like this.
:'''Nana:''' We have returned to that old question once again. Does Penny want to grow up or not?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Yes, this is the thirty-sixth time that we've raised the issue.
:'''Nana:''' We have made a list of all the pros and cons of being an adult. Do you have the list, Quijano?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Fret not, I have long since committed it to memory.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Con #1: Adults cannot sleep on velvet cushions, for adults are hard and sturdy creatures.
:'''Don Quijano:''' They must sleep on boards of hardwood, so that they can keep their minds and bodies hard.
:'''Nana:''' It's awful not to be able to sleep on soft cushions.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Con #2: Adults aren't allowed to catch butterflies, though I have not the slightest idea why.
:'''Nana:''' I know. I remember how Autumn grew up. It began when she stopped stepping in puddles as she passed.
:'''Nana:''' Then, she refused to go barefoot after getting out of bed. She insisted on wearing her leather shoes.
:'''Nana:''' And finally, I asked her if she'd like to go catch butterflies together one day. She refused, and picked up her textbooks and went into the study.
:'''Nana:''' That was the moment she grew up. I saw her become an adult, just like that.
:'''Nana:''' That is why I believe that being an adult means you cannot go catch butterflies.
:'''Penny:''' Actually, not catching butterflies is fine. There are other plenty more fun things to do.
:'''Nana:''' Oh, but it's not just these, dear. Out of all those fun things, you must choose only one.
:'''Nana:''' You can't do math when you're busy eating cookies, and it's difficult to eat cake when you're holding a musket.
:'''Penny:''' That's rough. So I can't have other stuff like bearings, bows and arrows, and pretty dresses all at the same time?
:'''Nana:''' No, dear, you can't. You can only choose one, because humans only live once.
:'''Nana:''' Not to mention, Penny, that Quijano and I will no longer be able to keep you company.
:'''Penny:''' What? You can't grow up with me? How can I be without you?
:'''Penny:''' Who's going to lick my face when I wake up, who's going to tell me bedtime stories? What am I supposed to do...?
:'''Nana:''' My poor Penny, you know my purpose is to love and protect you. I, too, am sad that I cannot grow up with you.
:'''Paimon:''' Ohh, Paimon doesn't know why, but now she feels like crying too.
:{{DIcon}} Don't cry.
:{{DIcon}} Growing up is not necessarily a bad thing.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Ladies, please do not weep... If I may be earnest, I cannot bear the sight of tears.
:'''Don Quijano:''' If I could pierce that which makes you weep, I should draw my sword this instant, but I...
:'''Don Quijano:''' Ah! I cannot bear it! I really can't! I've got to do something!
:'''Don Quijano:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} Knight, let us think of a way to stem their tears! We...
:'''Don Quijano:''' We... Perhaps we can bring the children back, and let them sing with Penny and Nana. Surely, that would make them happy!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Yes! That is exactly what we should do! Come! Come over here now, let's figure out how to get it done.

;(Talk to Penny and Nana again, optional)
:'''Penny:''' I... feel so sad, Nana.
:'''Nana:''' Don't be sad, Penny... *whimper*

;(Talk to Don Quijano)
:'''Don Quijano:''' Dear friends, how do you feel about the idea?
:'''Paimon:''' We just need to find the "children" and bring them back? Err, this probably isn't going to solve the real problem...
:{{DIcon}} She still has to face growing pains, eventually.
:'''Don Quijano:''' I know, I know... But since she cannot choose... Can't we just let her grow up later?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Were Penny to grow up just like that, who would scratch under my chin? Who would cuddle me at night as I sleep?
:'''Don Quijano:''' No, no! Let us give her more time.
:'''Don Quijano:''' As Penny's dear friend, I must put a stop to her tears this very instant, and make her smile!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Lady Nana's purpose is to love Penny, and mine is to be Penny's knight! I must protect her from harm.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Alas! I truly am a failure. To think that Penny is crying before my very eyes! If only I were a real knight.
:'''Paimon:''' Out of curiosity, why do you want to be a knight so badly, Quijano?
:'''Don Quijano:''' It is my calling, friends. Have you never been entrusted with such a noble cause?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Rouge tasked me with this duty, and I took an oath to protect Penny.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Don Quijano is one who keeps his word! Now! There is no more time to lose. We must take action now!
:'''Paimon:''' Sure. Paimon doesn't want her friends to cry, either.
:{{DIcon}} Count me in.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Very well. Then it's time to get up, Children!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Listen to me, Children! Our Penny is facing an unprecedented emotional crisis!
:'''Don Quijano:''' We must bring back all the missing troublemakers in order to restore her smile.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Then we shall sing together for her, and make her happy. That's what friends do, right?
:'''"Children":''' Yes! Yes! Yes!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Honorable {{Traveler}}, Lady Paimon, this is embarrassing, but...
:'''Don Quijano:''' I, Don Quijano, am well-versed in both swords and fairy tales, and I am an ingenious gentleman. But I fear... I cannot swim.
:'''Don Quijano:''' May I task you with the glorious mission of retrieving the troublemakers from underwater?
:'''Paimon:''' Sure, it'll be a piece of cake.
:{{DIcon}} Yes.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Children, help our new friends out here, and don't be naughty.
:'''"Children":''' Got it, got it, got it!
:'''"Children":''' Follow us, follow us, follow us!

;(After the cutscene)
:'''"Children":''' Together, together, together, let's swim.
:'''"Children":''' Don't lose it, lose it, lose it.
:'''"Children":''' Ahead, ahead, ahead, you'll find the troublemakers ahead.
:'''Paimon:''' These kids don't feel all that reliable... But well, they are kids. We shouldn't pin too many hopes on them...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's have a closer look around and see what happens, shall we?

;(Talk to Penny, Nana, and Don Quijano, optional)
:'''Nana:''' *whimper* I'm so sad, Penny.
:'''Penny:''' Good Nana, good girl. We can't keep crying.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Ladies, be strong.

;(Follow the "children" to the destination)
:'''"Children":''' Stuck in rocks, stuck in rocks, stuck in the rocks.
:'''"Children":''' So worried, so worried, worried are we.
:'''Paimon:''' It seems like the troublemakers are trapped among the rocks. Let's try to break the rocks and rescue them.

;(Destroy the large rock)
:'''Children:''' Out, out, we're out.
:'''Children:''' Thank you, friends, thank you, thank you.
:'''Children:''' We'll keep swimming, swimming, swimming.

;(While following the "children")
:'''Paimon:''' Do you remember, {{Traveler}}? That... Oh, what was his full name? The feline gentleman with the hat? Paimon's forgotten.
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, now that it's just us and the "children," Paimon can give them some convenient nicknames.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... A man in a hat and a lady in a skirt. Mr. Hat and Ms. Skirt, that's what Paimon will call them.
:'''Paimon:''' Now, what was Paimon going to say... Oh, she's gone and forgotten!
:'''Paimon:''' So the "children" are all young fish. They sure can swim though, despite their small size. We've come miles!
:'''Paimon:''' Phew! All this swimming is tiring Paimon out.
:'''"Children":''' We're not small, not small, not small.
:'''"Children":''' Big fish swim ahead, bigger than Paimon, bigger than Quijano.
:'''"Children":''' Let's go find them, find them, find them!

;(Reach the destination)
:'''"Children":''' Stuck and so worried, so worried we are.
:'''"Children":''' Get her out, get her out!
:'''Paimon:''' This one is certainly much larger. She must be the one.

;(Cut the [[Fontemer Seagrass]])
:'''"Bighead":''' Free at last, free at last! I can sing along with everyone again!
:'''"Bighead":''' Sing together, and together we sing!

;(While following the "children")
:'''"Children":''' We sing, we sing, we sing along ♪
:'''"Children":''' Sing to the waves, sing to the seaweed, sing to new friends ♪
:'''"Children":''' "Butterfly, butterfly, where do you fly?"
:'''"Children":''' "I know not, I ask not,"
:'''"Children":''' "Nor have I a place to lie."
:'''"Children":''' "Child, little child, where goeth you?"
:'''"Children":''' "I know not, I shall ask, for I wish to."

;(Reach the destination)
:'''"Children":''' Found it, found it, found it.
:'''"Children":''' Those little troublemakers are competing again. Whoever catches them wins!
:'''Paimon:''' You mean, the swarms of fast-swimming blue fish are the "children" we need to bring back?
:'''"Children":''' Yes! Yes! Catch up to them and tell them:
:'''"Children":''' "I caught you! I caught you! I caught you!"
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like Mr. Cat Hatter was right. They really are a bunch of mischievous kids.

;(Catch one school of fish)
:'''"Lil' Rascal":''' Ah, we've been caught! What fun! Let's play again next time!
:'''Paimon:''' Phew, they sure are slippery, what with how fast they swim! Well, that leaves two more groups of troublemakers. Let's look around.

;(Catch a second school of fish)
:'''"Lil' Rascal":''' Ah, we've been caught! What fun! Let's play again next time!
:'''Paimon:''' Phew, they sure are slippery, what with how fast they swim! One last group left. Let's look around.

;(Catch a third school of fish)
:'''"Lil' Rascal":''' Ah, we've been caught! What fun! Let's play again next time!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, cut it out and go home! Your friend Penny needs you!
:'''"Lil' Rascal":''' Penny, looking for us? Home, home, let's go home!

;(While following the "children")
:'''"Children":''' And where are the scaredy-cats, the scaredy-cats? Hear this song and respond to us.
:'''"Children":''' La-la-la, la-la-la, sing to the waves, sing to the seaweed, sing to our new friends ♪
:'''"Children":''' "Butterfly, butterfly, whence shall I go?"
:'''"Children":''' "You do not answer, you do not know."
:'''"Children":''' "Butterfly, butterfly, let us soar through the air."
:'''"Children":''' "Through rain and through dew, and through songs fair."
:'''"Children":''' "Butterfly, butterfly, let us both go."
:'''"Children":''' "Where the sun shines, and where the buds grow."

;(Reach the destination)
:'''"Scaredy-Cat":''' *sob* We miss Penny &mdash; where is she now? We're locked up in here...

;(Approach the fish)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like these are the "scaredy cats" we need to save. The door seems locked, and the sluice gate is inside the cabin again...
:'''Paimon:''' Might there be another entrance? Let's go look for it.

;(Destroy the rock pile at the side of the shipwreck)
:'''Paimon:''' Nice, we've found the entrance! Let's get into that cabin and calm them down.

;(Interact with the fish)
:'''"Children":''' Don't be scared, don't be scared! Penny's waiting for you to go back home.
:'''"Scaredy-Cat":''' Penny, looking for us? Home, home, let's go home quick!
:'''"Children":''' Let's go home, new friends, let's all go home. Penny's waiting for us there.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! Let's go look for Penny. Mr. Hat and Ms. Skirt are probably waiting for us, too.
----
;(Approach Penny)
:'''Paimon:''' We're back, everyone. Are all the "children" back as well?
:'''Don Quijano:''' Yes. The Honorable {{Traveler}}, and Lady Paimon too, they have all returned.
:'''"Children":''' We're here, we're here, we're here.
:{{DIcon}} Penny's not crying anymore.
:{{DIcon}} Are you still sad, Penny?
:'''Penny:''' I've stopped crying for a while now. Nana licked all of my tears away. Thank you, good Nana. You too, Quijano, {{Traveler}}, and Paimon.
:'''Nana:''' My pleasure, Penny. It is my calling to love you, after all.
:'''Don Quijano:''' Ah-ha! I knew it, I knew our Penny would be strong enough, and would never keep crying.
:'''Penny:''' Actually, I'm not that strong. I'm still a little scared and want to cry a little...
:'''"Children":''' It's okay, don't be afraid! Let's sing!
:'''"Children":''' Let's all swim and sing, Penny!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Great idea, my friends! Sadness and sorrow have been conquered, and so we shall raise our voices in glorious song!
:'''"Children":''' Come here, new friends, board the wave's back, and she will carry you.
:'''Nana:''' Don't worry, friends, we'll follow you on the shore.

;(Talk to Penny, Nana, and Don Quijano again, optional)
:'''Don Quijano:''' Sing, friends!
:'''Penny:''' Sing!
:'''Nana:''' I will sing with you!

;(Enter the wave)
:'''"Children":''' Sing along, sing along, come and sing a song! ♪
:'''Penny:''' Rouge's sword, Autumn's handkerchief,
:'''Penny:''' Freeman's candies, Kerek's ballad,
:'''Penny:''' {{Traveler}} swims with me, Paimon sings me to sleep,
:'''Penny:''' We won't forget, forget the times we spent so fine.
:'''"Children":''' Swim ahead, swim along, swim, swim, along!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Will they be forgotten in the blink of an eye, those times we spent so fine?
:'''Nana:''' The bedtime tales, the promises we made, the anticipation we had &mdash; forgotten?
:'''"Children":''' La-la-la, la-la-la, forget it all ♪
:'''Penny:''' We won't forget, forget the times we spent so fine.

;(Approach "Bighead")
:'''Bighead:''' Swim on, fly on, swim, swim, fly!

;(Head to shore)
:'''Penny:''' Swim on, fly on ♪
:'''Penny:''' That's a great song. I'm not scared now. It's fine to grow up! Nothing to it.
:'''Paimon:''' That was a great swim! No effort needed on our part... Though getting shot out of the water by "Bighead" at the end was plenty spooky.
:{{DIcon}} I'd love to do it again.
:{{DIcon}} I feel dizzy...
:'''Don Quijano:''' Friends, seeing you all smile together makes me most happy indeed!
:'''Penny:''' I've realized something big! I must tell Rouge about this the next time I see him.
:'''Don Quijano:''' I'm the shadow Rouge casts, and it is my honor to accompany you, my lady.
:'''Penny:''' Oh, and another thing, when Autumn comes back from the Court of Fontaine, I must tell her about you two, {{Traveler}}, Paimon!
:'''Paimon:''' Are you and this Autumn close, Penny?
:'''Penny:''' Autumn's very nice to me. She left Nana behind to watch over me. They're my absolute favorites!
:'''Nana:''' I am the fragrance that Autumn left behind, and your smile is my bliss, my dear Sweetheart.
:'''Penny:''' Thump!
:'''Don Quijano:''' Nana, did you hear that? Did something just go "thump"?
:'''Nana:''' Yes, I heard it too. And did you notice? There is something shining in Penny's eyes.
:'''Penny:''' What is that?
:'''Nana:''' It is the light of curiosity, which illuminates every dark corner, my dear.
:'''Don Quijano:''' And some glistening teardrops, making you all the more gentle.
:'''Nana:''' You have already grown up with our blessing, my good child.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, we haven't given Penny our blessings &mdash; and she's a grownup already?
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, {{Traveler}}, let's give Penny our blessings. May... uh, you always have a good appetite!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' I'm a traveler, so... May you always have the courage to explore the world.
:'''Penny:''' Explore the world...
:'''Penny:''' I've decided!
:'''Don Quijano:''' What did you decide, Penny?
:'''Penny:''' I was going to become a grownup in the Court of Fontaine, but now I've changed my mind! I want to travel just like {{Traveler}}.
:'''Paimon:''' You mean you want to be an adventurer, Penny?
:'''Penny:''' Yes. {{Traveler}} and Paimon are adventurers. If I want to travel like them, I have to be an adventurer too.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' If you want to be an adventurer, Penny, you have to get the Adventurers' Guild's approval first.
:'''Paimon:''' And that is a very hard thing to do, not to mention how the life of an adventurer's pretty tough, so are you sure that's what you want?
:'''Penny:''' It's okay, I wanna give it a try!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' In that case, I'll write a recommendation for you as your rite-of-passage gift, Penny.
:{{Black Screen|You borrow pen and paper from Penny and write a simple introduction letter.}}
:'''Penny:''' Wonderful, thank you! I love it! C'mon, I'll give everyone a gift too! Please gather 'round...
:{{Black Screen|Penny skips and kisses Mr. Hat and Ms. Skirt on the forehead with a smile.}}
:{{Black Screen|Then she kisses Paimon on the cheek before you bend over...}}
:{{Black Screen|As Penny kisses your forehead with joy, you can almost feel her anticipation and unease about the future.}}
:'''Penny:''' Dearest, most beloved friends of mine... I'm an adult now, and I'm going to be an adventurer!

==Trivia==
* Penny's song is the real life {{w|Hey Diddle Diddle}} nursery rhyme. The usage of "fun" over "sport" is a variation that exists in real life, but the replacement of "cow" with "fish" is not.
* The name of the achievement ''I Do Believe in Fairies'' is a quote from ''{{w|Peter Pan}}'', a novel by J. M. Barrie that tells a story of Peter Pan, a mischievous little boy who refuses to grow up. The quest has been loosely inspired by the novel. 
* Don Quijano's name is a reference to Alonso Quijano, better known as Don Quixote, the titular protagonist of the novel ''{{w|Don Quixote}}'' by Miguel de Cervantes. 
* Don Quijano's appearance was inspired by ''{{w|Puss in Boots}}'', a fairy tale about an anthropomorphic cat who is a chivalrous scoundrel, famously depicted wearing a hat, a sword, and a pair of boots. 
* After completing the quest, one of the group of "children" can be permanently seen swimming by the same shipwreck where they played catch with the Traveler.
