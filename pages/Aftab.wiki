==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aftab:''' I've got rugs everywhere inside the house. I'm running out of room to stand.
:{{DIcon}} What do you need all those rugs for?
::'''Aftab:''' The wharf? I haven't been there lately.
::'''Aftab:''' My family doesn't own a boat so if you want one, I think my neighbor's son used to be a sailor...
::{{DIcon}} I mean rugs...
::'''Aftab:''' Oh, you mean these rugs!
::'''Aftab:''' Good question. I've been asking myself why I needed all these rugs.
::'''Aftab:''' But [[Sulaykha]] would talk my ear off every time I went to the [[Grand Bazaar]], and I'd come back with several rugs in tow...
::'''Aftab:''' She made a lot of sense on how each rug was useful...
::'''Aftab:''' But it's a different story when I get home.
::'''Aftab:''' I don't know why I just couldn't stop buying them!
:{{DIcon}} You get to lie down, then.
::'''Aftab:''' Oh yeah!
