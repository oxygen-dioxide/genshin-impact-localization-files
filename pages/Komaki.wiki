==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Komaki''': How do you do, youngster?
:{{DIcon}} Hi there, Granny Komaki!
::'''Komaki''': Haha, it's so good to see you all again. Might you be interested in a little fortune-telling next time if you get the chance?
::{{DIcon}} About [[Bourou Village]]...
:::'''Komaki''': Oh? You're asking about the village?
:::'''Komaki''': There's not much to be said about it. It is simply the place where we have lived over many generations.
:::'''Komaki''': It's just that this place has experienced far more history than many others... But not as much as Sangonomiya Shrine, of course...
::{{DIcon}} About the [[Spiritherb]]s...
:::'''Komaki''': Thanks to your help, it's growing very well...
:::'''Komaki''': But I think that it will need some rest before it can regain its efficacy again, haha...
:::'''Komaki''': It is a fine year, and wishes in the waters have been very rich indeed. I believe that they will only get better...
:{{DIcon}} See you, Granny.
::'''Komaki''': Alright, go well. Come again soon!
