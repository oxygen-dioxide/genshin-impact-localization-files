==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cip:''' Hello there... Sorry, I was just meditating. Did I miss anything?
:{{DIcon|Reputation}} About my reputation with the Masters of the Night-Wind...
::'''Cip:''' Ah yes. Thank you for your assistance. May you never be lost amidst the mists.
:{{DIcon}} Hello. What is this place?
::'''Cip:''' Ah, this is an Obsidian Totem Pole. Obsidian is quite common here in Natlan, though, so we often shorten that to "Totem Pole."
::'''Cip:''' I know what you're thinking, and I don't think that there's any kind of causal relationship there either, but that's what the guard who was posted here before told me.
::'''Cip:''' Now, I had my doubts, but as I was the new guard and all at the time, I didn't voice them.
::'''Cip:''' I suppose it's just a little inside joke... Which, for the record, I don't find funny.
::'''Cip:''' So I'll just tell the same story to whoever my future successor is going to be &mdash; might be interesting to see how long something as meaningless as this can be passed down.
:{{DIcon}} Have you thought of any kind of answer?
::'''Cip:''' Answers must be preceded by questions, I'm afraid.
::'''Cip:''' And to be honest, I find that my thoughts have already run off to some distant place before I can ever come up with worthwhile questions.
::'''Cip:''' Strictly speaking, this defeats the purpose of meditation... which might be why I'm a guard, and not the chief.
::'''Cip:''' Not that this is a bad thing, I mean. Our tribe's got no shortage of eccentrics, so we can just leave the important duties to them, while I do my own job.
:{{DIcon}} Nah, you're good.
::'''Cip:''' And that's good. Thank you... Uh, I mean, see you, and stay safe.
