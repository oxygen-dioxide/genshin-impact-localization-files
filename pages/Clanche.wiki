:'''Clanche:''' Why hello there! How do you fare, my windriders?
:{{DIcon}} About the Windpath...
::'''Clanche:''' Well, I did specifically select them for their particular intensity.
::'''Clanche:''' I believe that one must face the furious flurry without practice or preparation to best hone one's art of flight &mdash; to best uncover one's true potential.
::'''Clanche:''' Flying squirrels nowadays are far too timid! They've utterly forgotten the lessons taught by the "Brave Northerly Wind"!
::'''Clanche:''' They stand in safe spots and declaiming the courage of leaves that dance in the wind, yet are far too frightened to leap into its embrace themselves.
::'''Clanche:''' How can we protect the kingdom alongside [[Cimest|Her Highness]] if things keep going this way?
::'''Clanche:''' Shall we merely watch and applaud helplessly as our Princess fights our battles? How risible!
::'''Clanche:''' It is our duty to defend the kingdom, mastering flight our obligation!
::'''Clanche:''' The safety of the realm is intimately tied to each and every one of us!
::'''Clanche:''' Still... Hmph. I wonder if any of my kin will understand these words &mdash; they likely think me some obstinate idiot.
::'''Clanche:''' No matter! Once my techniques have been refined, I shall leave them all speechless.
::'''Clanche:''' When the time comes, I shall once again tell them of my philosophy.
:{{DIcon}} About the "Brave Northerly Wind"...
::'''Clanche:''' You want to hear the tale? Sure. But first, let me take a moment to put my thoughts together. This story is well-known in our kingdom, and there have been many spins on the narrative...
::'''Clanche:''' But most begin this way: "A long, long time ago, there was a band of northerly winds learning to blow across all things..."
::'''Clanche:''' Amongst those northerly winds, there was one who was especially timid. Whenever he blew across the land, he was always scared stiff.
::'''Clanche:''' "I blew the flowers down, blustered the leaves a-blister... and swept hats off the heads of passersby... My goodness, I even left that lovely lake all a-stir!"
::'''Clanche:''' Day passed, years went by, this north wind never again dared to blow forth, and the land he was charged with fell into an awkward, windless torpor.
::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
:::'''Clanche:''' And so, his friends, the flying squirrels, came to him and asked, "Why do you never come out anymore? Have you fallen ill?"
:::'''Clanche:''' The north wind said sadly, "I've ruined everything! I've brought nothing but sadness and sorrow, and the ruination of such good things..."
:::'''Clanche:''' "No you haven't!" His friends cried out in surprise. "You've helped us soar into the skies. You've carried rainwater to distant places, and delivered petals and seeds to their places!"
:::'''Clanche:''' "I know. This is my duty... But I want to avoid the mistakes I make." He shook his head. "There must be a better way to finish my job &mdash; better than what I'm doing now."
:::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
::::'''Clanche:''' His friends looked at each other, knowing that the north wind was shrouded in self-doubt and anxiety. But for their friend's sake, they needed to come up with something.
::::'''Clanche:''' And so they told the north wind to blow upon them once more as he pleased &mdash; that this time, they'd take care of everything on the ground.
::::'''Clanche:''' And thus the saddened north wind set out, still half-mired in doubt. Once more did he blow across the plains, through the forests, and over the lakes.
::::'''Clanche:''' As he looked down, he saw his friends waving at him. All was in order, with not the slightest spot of a mess.
::::'''Clanche:''' Only then did the north wind see clearly that the petals he had blown away were filled with tiny seeds, and that new shoots could grow only after the withered yellow leaves had been blown down.
::::'''Clanche:''' And as for that hat... Well, if nothing else, it succeeded in warning the rushing gentleman that the weather had shifted, and with it, so should his choice of clothes.
::::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
:::::'''Clanche:''' When he returned to his dwelling, the north wind expressed gratitude to his friends. Without their support, he surely would have caused a disaster.
:::::'''Clanche:''' But they just laughed, saying that they hadn't done anything differently from before.
:::::'''Clanche:''' The north wind had so wished for perfection that the slightest mistake would all but blinded him.
:::::'''Clanche:''' Yet mistakes are normal. Nothing is truly perfect.
:::::'''Clanche:''' A north wind seeking to carry out its duty should never have been so focused on avoiding making any mistakes at all.
:::::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
::::::'''Clanche:''' Instead, he should have worked hard toward his true goal: to help plants sow seeds far afield, to lift the burden from the backs of trees, to carry rainwater along, and to remind people to perhaps wear a layer or two less.
::::::'''Clanche:''' Only a north wind who completes their work in such a matter might be called brave.
::::::{{DIcon}} Does this story have anything to do with what you were saying before?
::::::{{DIcon}} That sounds like a different kind of courage.
::::::'''Clanche:''' It is absolutely related! It is fear of "mistakes" that holds the flying squirrels of our kingdom back from flight.
::::::'''Clanche:''' They fear being embarrassed, fear missteps, fear accidentally crashing into something... Just like how the north wind was terrified of blowing it.
::::::'''Clanche:''' Absolutely ridiculous! The only thing they should fear is the inability to master flight!
::::::'''Clanche:''' *sigh* I really should've made them re-read "Brave Northerly Wind"... You know what? I should just print some new copies and hand them out.
:::::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
::::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
:::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Clanche:''' See you! Feel free to return and challenge this windy passage at any time!
