Fostered by an expert hunter, she trained to hunt with cat-like grace and deadly accuracy – but the things she most wanted to learn, he could not teach her. Most of all, she burned to know the circumstances of her birth – who her parents were, and why she was shunned by the tribe.<br>Her quest for answers swept her into a wider and more dangerous world than she ever could have imagined. She encountered strange and powerful new tribes, ancient ruins rife with mysteries, and dangerous enemies, both human and machine.<br>Eventually she learned that her origins and destiny were deeply tied to the fate of the world itself, and fought an epic battle to save it against the evil forces of an artificial intelligence from the ancient past.<br>She thought that this would be the end of her journey. But there is always more to an adventurer's tale.

==Trivia==
* Aloy is the first and currently only collaboration character in the game.
* It is currently unknown how Aloy obtained her Vision and whether or not it was granted by the same method as everyone else. Alongside that, [[Vision#Other Vision Designs|Aloy's Vision]] also sports a completely unique design.
* Aloy's [[quality]] is displayed as a red background instead of orange, unlike other 5-stars.
** This is likely because Aloy is a collaboration character.
* Aloy does not appear in the [[Character Archive]] unless she was obtained.
** Her namecard and [[Satiety Gel]] are still listed in their respective menus regardless of if you have them or not.
* Aloy and the [[Traveler]] are the only characters that cannot be obtained using the [[Wishes|Wish]] system.
* Aloy is the first character whose [[Constellations]] cannot be activated, as [[Aloy's Stella Fortuna]] is currently unobtainable.
** During the [[Labyrinth Warriors]] event in [[Version 2.2]], it was possible to temporarily activate [[Star of Another World (1)|her first constellation]] through the "Exposure: Bastion of Order" Charm. However, as no effect is listed, it did nothing.
* In the [[Imaginarium Theater]], Aloy does not appear in the lobby if she was used in the previous round.
** Prior to [[Version 5.4]], Aloy also could not be selected as a Supporting Cast character.
* Aloy wields the ascended version of the PlayStation-exclusive [[Predator]] in her official art.
* Aloy is known by these aliases or titles:
** Seeker<ref name="Character Details">{{Ref/CS|Aloy|Character Details}}</ref>
** Anointed<ref name="Character Details"/>
** Savior<ref name="Character Details"/>
