|text    = Thanks to those idiots from the [[Arataki Gang]], I spent yet another "unexpected" birthday, and just finished taking care of the trouble they caused.

It's been so long, but they still haven't learned anything...

Never mind, let's just say this is why I can't just abandon them.

Oh right, do you have time now? Want to go for a walk together? Just the two of us.

I still remember all the help you gave me, and I'd like to thank you in person to show my sincere gratitude.

Also, I've discovered a few special uses of [[Naku Weed]] in my spare time, and I'd like to show them to you too...
