{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Pops Kai:''' Here for some tea? Please take a seat!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you have to sell, sir?
::'''Pops Kai:''' Please have a seat and stay for a while. You can try some of our very own Qingce Village tea.
:;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your tea store.
::'''Pops Kai:''' I set up shop here to provide some respite from the grueling and relentless farm work, both for old friends and for anyone else passing by.
::'''Pops Kai:''' But as you can see, business could be a little better, hehehe.
::'''Pops Kai:''' Still. Every time someone comes to me for a cup of tea and a chat, I think to myself, this is worth my while.
:{{DIcon}} Do you run the place on your own?
::'''Pops Kai:''' That's right. My son and his wife are off elsewhere, chasing their dreams. It's just the grandkids and I who are left in the village.
::'''Pops Kai:''' *sigh* If only I had an assistant. I could keep the place open while I was working in the fields.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Pops Kai:''' Leaving so soon? Have a safe trip.
