'''...And I Would Walk 3,000 More''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to complete the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[Chouji's Travels]].''

==Trivia==
* The name of the achievement references the song {{w|I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)}} by {{w|The Proclaimers}}, which contains the lines "But I would walk 500 miles / And I would walk 500 more" in the song's chorus.
** "500 miles" is replaced with the same distance as listed in the World Quest ''[[Gazing Three Thousand Miles Away]]'', which the player must complete before starting ''Chouji's Travels''.
** The "3000 miles" in the World Quest ''Gazing Three Thousand Miles Away'' is a reference to the Italian children's novel ''{{w|Heart (novel)|Heart}}'' by {{w|Edmondo De Amicis}}. A chapter of the book, "''From the Apennines to the Andes''," was adapted into the Japanese anime {{lang|''{{w|3000 Leagues in Search of Mother}}''|ja=母をたずねて三千里}} in 1976. The story follows a 13-year-old boy, Marco, who travels three thousand miles to Buenos Aires, Argentina in search of his lost mother, and eventually finds her bedridden at Mr. Mechines' house in Tucuman.
