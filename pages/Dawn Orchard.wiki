|description    = The orchards of the [[Dawn Winery]] are quite famous indeed. It is said that someone from the wine industry in another nation visited the Dawn Winery years ago to study it and gather experience in orchard management. The wine industries in various other nations raced to follow the resultant Dawn Orchard model.<br>Unfortunately, the excellence of the base ingredients is only one factor in the production of fine wines, and it is the Dawn Winery's skill in wine making that is key to its position at the apex of the industry. Unable to compete, some of its rivals had to resort to using part of their produce to make fruit juice to balance the books.
