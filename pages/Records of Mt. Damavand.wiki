The '''Records of Mt. Damavand''' are a set of interactable notes found around [[Mt. Damavand]], [[Sumeru]]. They take the form of stone tablets, and will initially be broken until completing [[Pipe Diverter Valve]] puzzles related to the progression of the quest ''[[Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part II]]''.

==Dialogue==
===Records of Mt. Damavand: Part I===
Inspections in recent years have shown that the Orchard of Pairidaeza's water output has been decreasing, while the outer oases are showing signs of shrinkage. Lady [[Ferigees]] grows ever weaker, and she no longer actively responds to our calls.<br>
...Perhaps this is an issue of aging machinery. If that is so, then there must be some solution... [[King Deshret]] is the sole source of all wisdom here. We must continue to pray, and continue reading the ancient texts and diagrams...

...Machinery with Jinn fragments implanted in their outer casings are far more efficient than traditional irrigation equipment, and that technology has come to be widely used in water supply regulation...

...Engineering point of note: Do the Jinn also age with the passing of years?

===Records of Mt. Damavand: Part II===
...The lower-ranked priests often complain that the water pipes contain sand sediment. This is a problem that has never occurred before.<br>
...To clean the pipes... Panjvahe had its water supply disrupted for half a day, which greatly distressed Lady Ferigees, though one supposes that several centuries of unmoving duty would do that to anyone, if not worse...

...The priestess has made her estimation of the water supply system's life span: She says that it will cease functioning in three hundred years. However, it will only take... years for the oasis canal system as it is today to become inoperable... maintenance must be our utmost priority...

...Lady Ferigees has rejected the suggested large-scale maintenance on account of the disturbance it might bring to the sanctuary of the [[Nabu Malikata|Goddess of Flowers]]' tomb...<br>
...She is the great Jinni, whom King Deshret himself charged with guardianship over the [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|Orchard of Pairidaeza]]. Without her permission, the plan could only be shelved...<br>
...But she has suggested that some of her power can be diverted to cleansing the waterways. This will place great strain upon her, even more so than is already the case in her role as the mausoleum's sentinel...

===Records of Mt. Damavand: Part III===
...The maintenance funds provided by His Majesty [[Parvezravan]] have been decreased by... times ten thousand silvers...<br>
...The priestess was silent when asked where this money went. What future has she foreseen?<br>
...Does His Majesty not know of the great danger the reservoir is in? Or is he content to stand by and watch?

...The malfunctioning filtration system has already rendered Panjvahe's irrigation canal network unusable. There is mud and sand everywhere, so much so that even constructs that sink into the muck become completely immobile.<br>
...The once-thriving agricultural regions have seen their wealthy move away en masse. Has no one petitioned Parvezravan concerning this?<br>
...And Lady Ferigees now lacks even the strength for wrath...

...The ancient legends say that the judgment that once descended from the heavens sleeps under [[Mt. Damavand]]. Perhaps the time for judgment draws near again...

...It is hard to believe that His Majesty Parvezravan may be bewitched by spectacles conjured by [[Jinni|Jinn]] slaves, and yet he cannot see the foundations of the very earth coming loose under his feet...
