==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|'''Step 1:''' The expedition to investigate [[Osial]] in the [[Guyun Stone Forest]] came away with slim pickings. [[Kliment]] and [[Wanyan]] also clashed vociferously over their differing perspectives, which has greatly displeased the former.During the argument, he heard Wanyan mention the tale of the [[God of Salt]], and decided to take the party there to try their luck, lest he finishes this venture empty-handed.<br><br>'''Step 4:''' Wanyan mentions that there is an unbreakable seal in Sal Terrae, and that this seal contains that which the God of Salt left behind. You unlock the first contraption with ease, while Zhongli stated that the key to the second puzzle lies within this statement: {{Color|buzzword|"Tianheng in the south, Yaoguang in the east, Jueyun in the west, Qingce in the north &mdash; All desolate and devoid of life. Liyue is vast, yet even one haven is hard to find."}}}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to the people)
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 kliment 01.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' I heard that Sal Terrae was once the home of the God of Salt's people. Therefore... *chuckles* There are sure to be loads of valuable relics nearby.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' According to legend, the people of the God of Salt, Havria, enjoyed prosperous lives under her protection.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But this legend has been around for ages. With the countless scrap collectors and [[Treasure Hoarders]] in the area, there probably aren't many valuable things left here.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 kliment 02.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Gah, that's just great... If I knew it was picked this clean before, I wouldn't have come.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' About that, I know there's a ruin deep in this cave here. It's related to the God of Salt, which is actually how the area originally got its name of Sal Terrae.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 02.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' However, the ruin entrance has been sealed by a mysterious power. Nobody has been able to break the seal.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 03.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' I found a mechanism that seemed to be related to the seal. But when I undid the mechanism, the seal wasn't affected at all.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 04.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' So at the moment, the seal's origin and how to break it are very important topics in my research on the God of Salt
:{{DIcon}} Is it related to the God of Salt's people?
:{{DIcon}} Is it related to [[Rex Lapis]]?
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 05.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' I don't know, there's no concrete evidence. But I'm pretty sure the seal is meant to hide some kind of long-forgotten truth.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 06.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' The God of Salt was a benevolent god adored by the people, not to mention powerful. She wouldn't have any kind of shameful secrets to hide.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 07.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' So... The one who wants to hide some truth is very possibly her killer, Morax.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This doesn't sound like something the Lord of Geo would do, though...
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 kliment 03.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Who cares about all that? It sounds like countless treasures of the God of Salt lie within this ruin, just waiting for someone to find them, right!?
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 08.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' You weren't listening at all, were you? Argh... Even if there's a mountain of treasures inside, nobody can  get in if the seal isn't broken.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 kliment 04.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Ah, but we have the illustrious Mr. Zhongli with us! He looks like he knows just about everything &mdash; a little seal shouldn't be any trouble for him.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 09.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' This seal seems to be quite ancient. Even Mr. Zhongli may not know all of its secrets...
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I may know something about it.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 10.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Wh&mdash;Whaaat!?
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Over the years, I've heard various rumors with bits of knowledge about seals. Although their references seem rather disorderly, they do in fact contain the secret to breaking seals.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Let's go take a look at the mechanism Miss Wanyan just mentioned.
:{{A|vo zllq003 2 wanyan 11.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Okay, since Mr. Zhongli says so... Follow me, then.

----

;(Go to the first mechanism)
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Here it is. There's some debris scattered here that, when put together, look like they definitely had something to do with the God of Salt.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 02.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' According to the inscription on the side, if one looks from a certain angle, the secret to the mechanism will be revealed.

;(After activating the first mechanism)
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 03.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' See that? Although we activated the mechanism, nothing happened to the seal...
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That's because there's actually another mechanism that must be activated.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 04.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' A&mdash;Another?
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Let me lead the way from here.

----

;(Go to the second mechanism)
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 05.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' This place seems familiar... Ah, I remember! I think there's some elemental monuments here &mdash; so you're saying they're related to all this?
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 06.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' When I investigated this seal last time, I had someone with a Vision accompany me.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 07.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' But when we lit up all the elemental monuments, nothing happened...
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That's because you don't just need to activate them at the same time, but in a certain order as well. Otherwise, the seal will not be broken.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The secret to this puzzle is hidden in the legends about the [[Archon War]].
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' "[[Mt. Tianheng|Tianheng]] in the {{Color|buzzword|south}}, [[Yaoguang Shoal|Yaoguang]] in the {{Color|buzzword|east}}, [[Jueyun Karst|Jueyun]] in the {{Color|buzzword|west}}, [[Qingce Village|Qingce]] in the {{Color|buzzword|north}} &mdash; All desolate and devoid of life. Liyue is vast, yet even one haven is hard to find."
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 kliment 01.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' To the north... to the east... Do the people of Liyue always talk in riddles?
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 08.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' I&mdash;I think I've heard this saying before!
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Certainly you have, and the contents of this saying are also related to the God of Salt.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' To provide a haven for her people, whose lives had been ravaged by the Archon War, this benevolent god searched all across Liyue.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' At that time, with the chaotic fires of war engulfing the land, even one sliver of peace was a luxury.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' And that haven she eventually found is right here. Today, it is known as Sal Terrae.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 09.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' How sad then... In the end, this peaceful place was destroyed by Morax.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 kliment 02.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Okay, enough with these ancient stories. Now that we have the clue, hurry up and break the seal! Whatever happened doesn't matter as long as we can get inside that ruin!
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Now think {{Traveler}}, {{Color|buzzword|"Tianheng in the south, Yaoguang in the east, Jueyun in the west, Qingce in the north."}}
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' With this clue, you should be able to solve the puzzle.

;(If failed to activate the elemental monuments correctly)
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Tianheng in the {{Color|buzzword|south}}, Yaoguang in the {{Color|buzzword|east}}, Jueyun in the {{Color|buzzword|west}}, Qingce in the {{Color|buzzword|north}}.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The directions are the clue. Give it another try.

;(Follow Zhongli's instructions and light the monuments up)
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 wanyan 10.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Look! The seal really was broken! Mr. Zhongli is indeed quite remarkable!
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It was nothing, really.
:{{A|vo zllq003 3 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Now, it's time that people learn the hidden truth lost in time.

----

;(Go to the site of the broken seal)
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Before entering the ruin, I have a proposal that will help us prevent the kind of senseless arguing between you two that we saw at Guyun Stone Forest.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Okay, what is it?
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I propose you two agree upon a contract, stipulating that we alternate who gets claim to each treasure we encounter, with only one object permitted per claim.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' To show my sincerity, I won't be taking any treasure &mdash; this will just be between you all.
:{{DIcon}} I won't take any either.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heyyy! Don't pass an opportunity like this up so easily!
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 kliment 01.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' I don't agree! I mean... you want me to split the treasure with this amateur archaeologist? No, absolutely not!
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 wanyan 02.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' I don't agree either! Hmph, he will only defile the precious relics left behind by the God of Salt! I&mdash;I can't accept this.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Well then... If the contract is not agreed upon, I will no longer serve as your consultant on this expedition.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You will have to rely on your own experience to find whatever treasures are hidden in this ruin, as well as traps.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 kliment 02.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Y&mdash;You have the audacity to demand this... Okay then. Even half of the treasure in the long-sealed ruin of the God of Salt should be enough to make a fortune.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 wanyan 03.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' If you want me to agree upon this contract, so be it... I just have one request, Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 wanyan 04.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' If we discover the truth behind the God of Salt, you must judge it fairly, even if the truth harms Morax's image.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I can accept this arrangement.
:{{A|vo zllq003 6 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Well then, let's go.
