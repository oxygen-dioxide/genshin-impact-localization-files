:'''Aybak:''' My sister, [[Safie]], seems to have gone missing again...
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Aybak/Diplomacy's End|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Aybak:''' Haha, don't worry! Playing cards is like adventuring. Some you win, some you lose!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Aybak:''' Wow, you dominated the game! Not surprised I lost to a natural like you.
:{{DIcon}} Are you looking for someone?
::'''Aybak:''' Yes.
::'''Aybak:''' ...Ah, please don't get me wrong. Safie isn't my real sister, it's because we're a very close-knit group, so we call each other brother and sister.
::'''Aybak:''' Our group just received a few new commissions, and one of them really suits her. But she's nowhere to be found... I guess she wandered off somewhere again.
::{{DIcon}} Why don't you do it yourself?
:::'''Aybak:''' Haha, that won't be necessary. We're not that shorthanded.
:::'''Aybak:''' I'm the leader of the Eremites in Caravan Ribat. It's best if I stay to supervise public safety here and carry out the maintenance of the [[Wall of Samiel]].
:::'''Aybak:''' Those are basic orders from [[Sumeru Akademiya|the Akademiya]], and I can deal with them on my own.
:::'''Aybak:''' As for the other commissions, my brothers and sisters can see to them. If all of us can make money, we'll live happily together.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Need my help?
::::'''Aybak:''' It's okay. It's not an emergency. No need to bother anyone else.
::::'''Aybak:''' And she should be able to take care of herself on her own.
::::'''Aybak:''' But you, you'd better watch yourself. In this place, quite a lot of people come and go... if you know what I mean.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Hero's Wit|20|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Aybak:''' See you.
