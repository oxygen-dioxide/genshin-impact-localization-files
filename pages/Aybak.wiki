==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aybak:''' My sister, [[Safie]], seems to have gone missing again...
:{{DIcon}} Are you looking for someone?
::'''Aybak:''' Yes.
::'''Aybak:''' ...Ah, please don't get me wrong. Safie isn't my real sister, it's because we're a very close-knit group, so we call each other brother and sister.
::'''Aybak:''' Our group just received a few new commissions, and one of them really suits her. But she's nowhere to be found... I guess she wandered off somewhere again.
::{{DIcon}} Why don't you do it yourself?
::'''Aybak:''' Haha, that won't be necessary. We're not that shorthanded.
::'''Aybak:''' I'm the leader of the Eremites in Caravan Ribat. It's best if I stay to supervise public safety here and carry out the maintenance of the [[Wall of Samiel]].
::'''Aybak:''' Those are basic orders from [[Sumeru Akademiya|the Akademiya]], and I can deal with them on my own.
::'''Aybak:''' As for the other commissions, my brothers and sisters can see to them. If all of us can make money, we'll live happily together.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Need my help?
::'''Aybak:''' It's okay. It's not an emergency. No need to bother anyone else.
::'''Aybak:''' And she should be able to take care of herself on her own.
::'''Aybak:''' But you, you'd better watch yourself. In this place, quite a lot of people come and go... if you know what I mean.
:;(Obtain [[Hero's Wit]] ×2)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Aybak:''' See you.
