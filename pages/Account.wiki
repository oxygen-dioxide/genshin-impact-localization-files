'''Accounts''' in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' hold the data of the character's progress throughout the game.

Accounts on the global servers can be created using a HoYoverse Account, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple ID, or Game Center,<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/5552 Genshin Impact Official Release FAQ]</ref> and on the Chinese server using a miHoYo Account, TapTap or Bilibili.

Players can participate in [[Co-Op Mode]] with players from other platforms, but not with those on different servers.

Players on PC, iOS, Android and Xbox can change servers on the title screen. If the account already created a character on one server, the progress from the original server do not transfer to the new server, so the new server's character starts new. Both characters on both servers progress independently. The only thing connecting the two characters is the login method.

==Cross Save==
'''Cross Save''' is a system where the player's progress in a game is stored on a server, and can be resumed on a different hardware platform. For [[Genshin Impact]], there are primarily 3 different types of hardware: {{w|Personal computer}}s, {{w|Video game console}}s, and {{w|Mobile device}}s.''

With the use of cross save, players are able to obtain contents that are initially exclusive to PlayStation or Xbox. The user first needs to log-in to the game on their respective platform to obtain the content and then activate the cross save feature.
