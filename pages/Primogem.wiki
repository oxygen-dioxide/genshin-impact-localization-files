==Trivia==
* The word Primogem is likely a portmanteau of the words "primordial" and "gem."
* The Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese term for Primogem is {{zh|原石|lit=primordial stone.}} This term likely derives from the same usage of "primordial" as {{zh|原神|lit=primordial god,}} the title of [[Genshin Impact|the game]] as well as the term "[[allogenes]]."
** This term can also literally mean "rough gemstone," but that definition is not likely related to its usage in the game.
