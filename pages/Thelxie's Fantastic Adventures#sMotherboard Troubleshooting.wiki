==Tutorial==
;Broken Circuits
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures Motherboard Troubleshooting Broken Circuits.png
|text1  = The debugging process features broken circuits. Broken circuits will immediately connect when the signal passes through an inductive switch of the corresponding color.
}}
;Multi-Circuits
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures Motherboard Troubleshooting Multi-Circuits.png
|text1  = There can be up to two different circuits involved in one debugging process. Circuit starting points and endpoints will have the same color.
}}
;Debug Manual
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures Motherboard Troubleshooting Debug Manual.png
|text1  = After the debugging process has gone on for a while, you can use the debug manual to obtain clues about how to set the circuit up.
}}
;Branching Paths
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures Motherboard Troubleshooting Branching Paths.png
|text1  = When a signal passes through an inductive switch of a specific color, the branching path connection direction will change. You can repeatedly activate such inductive switches this way.
