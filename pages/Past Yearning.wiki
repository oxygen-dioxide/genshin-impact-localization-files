== Trivia ==
* {{Transclude|First Blossom of Spring|GuizhongLeitmotif|section=1}}
*The Chinese name of the soundtrack may be a reference to a poem by Song Dynasty poet Zuo Hao. The poem{{Lang|zh=再和晦之|zh_tl=With Huizhi Again}} reads:
**{{zh|举世欣欣濮上音，丝桐还寄长卿心。<br>知君韶濩思千载，劲节松筠挺几寻。<br>万籁息时霜剑立，一灯明处夜堂深。<br>他年振铎收遗器，岂愧云和瑟与琴。}}<br>The entire world thriving with indolent noise, the instrument still embodies the spirit of {{W|Liu Changqing|Changqing}}.<br>One knows your court music pass on a thousand years, quite a search for the unrelenting rhythm of steadfast pine and bamboo.<br>As all the noises of the world fall silent when the destructive frost rises, one lamp glows in the deepening night.<br>In past years bells were rung in collecting ancient relics, why be ashamed of the clouds, {{W|Se (instrument)|zither}}, or {{W|Guqin|''qin''}}?
