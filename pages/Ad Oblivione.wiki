==Trivia==
* Ad Oblivione shares the same theme with [[Finale of the Snowtomb]].
* The term "Ad Oblivione" initially appeared to have no in-universe significance; however, it would later be referenced by the quest ''[[The Final Chapter]]'', where [[Aranaga]] describes Ad Oblivione as "the wind that flows forever" and "the thousand winds that return to one." This suggests a relationship with the [[Thousand Winds]].
