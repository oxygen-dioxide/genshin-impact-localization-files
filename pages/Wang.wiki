{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Wang after completing The Millennial Mountains)
:'''Wang:''' O great Millelith heroes, please see to it that The Chasm does not act up these few days!
:'''Wang:''' And may we be safe and sound as we descend into the mines this time, and may those comrades of ours who no longer come to mine also fare well in their respective paths. Protect us, brave Millelith, protect us...
