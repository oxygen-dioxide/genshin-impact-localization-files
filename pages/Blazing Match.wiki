{{Description|"Yoimiya's handiwork is exquisite, and she dabbles in many other crafts besides firework-making, always adding her unique touch to all her work."|2=[[Dainsleif]] in [https://youtu.be/b4QN9epy680 Collected Miscellany - "Yoimiya: Whispers of the Flames"]}}
'''Blazing Match''' is [[Yoimiya]]'s [[Utility Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Yoimiya refunds 25% of the materials used. On average over time, she refunds 25% of each material used.
** The 25% is first calculated on the total number of rewards and rounded down. Then the refunded materials are re-distributed among the different materials used according to their original ratios, with decimals randomly rounded without changing the total quantity of refunded materials.{{Verify}} This means that if the quantity of any material used is not a multiple of 4, then there will be fluctuations in the amount of materials refunded.
*** For example, a furnishing that requires 12 of one material and 6 of another material has two possible distributions of refunded materials: 3 of the first material and 1 of the second material, or 2 of each material.<!-- verified in-game, this is what prompted the whole investigation that resulted in this wordy explanation--which is still ongoing and also encompasses expedition bonus and weapon forging refund talents -->

==Trivia==
* In Japanese and Chinese, the name of the talent can be translated as "The Art of Combining Flame Colors" {{Lang|zh=炎色配比法|ja=炎色の配合法|sort=ja,zh}}. This may be a reference to the chemical {{w|flame test}}s conducted by pyrotechnicians in order to obtain certain desired colors for fireworks.
