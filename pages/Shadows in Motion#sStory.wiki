===Intro===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''[[Paimon]]:''' We're about to leave for [[Fontaine]]. Before we go, let's make some preparations.
: '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! Paimon remembers [[Mona]] is a special columnist for [[the Steambird]]. She might know something. Let's go ask her!

: (The two arrive at Mona's house and find the door ajar)

: '''[[Traveler]]:''' Mona? Mona, are you home?
: '''Paimon:''' Traveler, look! Here's a pretty toy on the table. Is that a note pressed under it?
: '''Mona's Message:''' "Traveler, Paimon, the toybox containing miniaturized landscapes is meant for you. Inside, the collected sights have been gathered from all that you have encountered along your journeys, and also the place you wish to know the most about, of course. Do not be surprised, for the Great Astrologist has predicted all there is to be known beforehand. Remember to bring your [[Kamera]] and take some photos!"
: '''Paimon:''' Whoa! It looks really fun inside! Traveler, shall we start exploring now? Paimon can go inside the toybox and have a look around~
