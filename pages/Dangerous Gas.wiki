{{Description|Some poisonous gases that leak out within underground mines will explode when they make contact with fire. This is why no one lights fires within mines and use crystal lamps instead.|[[Loading Screen|Loading Tips]]}}
'''Dangerous Gases'''<ref>Safety Notice: [[The Chasm: Main Mining Area]]<br />''"There are dangerous gases in this area. Proceed with caution, and do not light any fires!"''</ref> are objects found in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. When Dangerous Gas is attacked using or comes in contact with entities affected by {{Pyro}} or {{Electro}}, it will create an explosion, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}} to both players and enemies. Dangerous Gas can be temporarily dispersed using {{Anemo}}.

==Trivia==
* [[Golden Finch]]es are used by the chasm miners to detect these gasses and some can be found in cages at the [[Chasm Exploration Team Camp|underground exploration camps]].<ref>{{Ref/Loading|The Chasm}}<br />''"Poisonous gases sometimes leak within underground mines. This is why the miners bring finches underground with them."''</ref> These finches function as {{w|Sentinel species|mine canaries}} which in real life were used by miners to detect harmful gasses in coal mines that humans could otherwise not detect on their own.
