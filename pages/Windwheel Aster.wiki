==Trivia==
*During [[A New Storm Is Brewing]], [[Vind]] explains that Windwheel Asters cannot grow in places with no wind nor plagued by strong storms, only where the wind is gentle and nourishing. As such, they used to determine how strong the wind was in a certain area based on how well they grew there.
*The following birthday mails included Windwheel Aster:
**[[Birthday/Venti#Yoo&mdash;Hoo!|Venti's 2021 Birthday Mail]] (10 Windwheel Aster)
**[[Birthday/Rosaria#Today...|Rosaria's 2022 Birthday Mail]] (10 Windwheel Aster)
**[[Birthday/Jean#A Productive Day|Jean's 2022 Birthday Mail]] (3 Windwheel Aster)
*Windwheel Asters, along with [[Dandelion]]s are popularly thought to be the Windblume. The Traveler could choose to offer a Windwheel Aster as their Windblume of choice during [[Invitation of Windblume]].
