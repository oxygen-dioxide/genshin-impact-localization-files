==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* During the {{Quest|A New Storm Is Brewing}}, [[Vind]] explains that Windwheel Asters cannot grow in places with no wind nor plagued by strong storms, it can only grow where the wind is gentle and nourishing. As such, Windwheel Asters are used to determine how strong the wind was in a certain area based on how well they grew there.
** Despite that, it seems to be possible for Windwheel Asters to grow in places with little to no wind, as they can be seen growing in [[Merusea Village]] if the player chose "Let's go with a Windwheel Aster" option to fulfill [[Cosanzeana|Cosanzeana's]] request in [[There Will Come Soft Rains]].
** [[Paimon]] mentions that "Windwheel Asters grow out in the wild, and they're a tough breed", as the reason why they might grow in Merusea Village.
* Windwheel Asters, along with [[Dandelion]]s are popularly thought to be the Windblume. The Traveler could choose to offer a Windwheel Aster as their Windblume of choice during [[Invitation of Windblume]].
