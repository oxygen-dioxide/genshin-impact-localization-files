==Trivia==
* During [[A New Storm Is Brewing]], [[Vind]] explains that Windwheel Asters cannot grow in places with no wind nor plagued by strong storms, only where the wind is gentle and nourishing. As such, they used to determine how strong the wind was in a certain area based on how well they grew there.
