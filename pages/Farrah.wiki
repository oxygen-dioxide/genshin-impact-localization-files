==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farrah:''' Traveler, this canyon is too dangerous for you. Please, keep your distance!
:{{DIcon}} Did something happen?
::'''Farrah:''' Recently, lots of monsters have been showing up in the canyon, to the point where we vendors have been chased out.
::'''Farrah:''' *sigh* If my fruit has all gone rotten when I get it back it'll go all slimy and disgusting when I try to wash it...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about Drunkard Gorge.
:::'''Farrah:''' This used to be a popular route for all the merchant caravans. I used to set up my stall in the canyon earn a few [[Mora]] too...
:::'''Farrah:''' Occasionally the odd monster would show up, and if so you just chalk it down to bad luck.
:::'''Farrah:''' But now, everyone's fled the canyon and the merchant caravan is stuck here with no way through.
:::'''Farrah:''' *sigh* It's not the end of the world if I can't sell the fruit, but if it goes rotten that's another story...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about your fruit stand.
:::'''Farrah:''' It's not so much about how much it cost...
:::'''Farrah:''' It's more that once you've got rotten fruit on it, it's a nightmare to clean. The juices go all slimy and stick to it for ages, and the smell is nearly impossible to get rid of...
:::'''Farrah:''' If don't get it cleaned in good time, my wife will kill me when I get back.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} You have my sympathies.
::::'''Farrah:''' *sigh* Thank you for that.
::::'''Farrah:''' Well, I do only have these few fruit on hand, and they won't sell for much. You may as well take them.
:::;(''Obtain [[Apple]] ×5'')
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like a lot of trouble.
:::'''Farrah:''' *sigh* I never said it wasn't...
:::'''Farrah:''' I'm a bit of a clean freak as well, so just thinking about cleaning these things is making me nauseous.
:::'''Farrah:''' If only [[Noelle]] from the [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]] was here. If she were here, all this would be spick and span in no time - even better than new!
:::'''Farrah:''' Still, I feel bad about troubling her to do something this trivial...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Farrah:''' Keep your eyes peeled when you're on the road.
::'''Farrah:''' *sigh* I think I can smell the fruit rotting...
