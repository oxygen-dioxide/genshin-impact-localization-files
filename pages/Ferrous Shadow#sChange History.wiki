[[Version 1.5]]
* The English description was adjusted to clarify that Ravenwood is the name of the Knight of Boreas, and not the name of the Knight of Boreas' greatsword. Some grammatical changes were also made to the sentence after it.
** '''{{Color|Old description}}:''' [...] modeled off the great Ravenwood, Knight of Boreas' own greatsword [...] Nor did he envisage that his young rival Rostam, who later died after serving the people of Mondstadt for 23 years, would one day become his most trusted right-hand man.
** '''{{Color|New description}}:''' [...] modeled off the one wielded by Ravenwood, the Knight of Boreas [...] Nor did he envisage that his playmate Rostam, with whom he sparred in their childhood, would grow up to become his most trusted right-hand man, before going on to die in the course of duty, having served the people of Mondstadt for 23 years.
