{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Charmian:''' Forgive my honesty, Intef, but we reached this point in our debate because you had to mention the Goat King.
:'''Intef:''' Of course, of course. And I agree with your assessment of him as a treacherous official. None would deny his role in [[King Deshret]]'s rulership had two sides.
:'''Intef:''' Good and evil &mdash; he was both. That is the reality of it, is it not? His ambition came from his power and wisdom.
:'''Charmian:''' Indeed, and compared to Lord [[Hermanubis]], all impure souls should know themselves filthy and shamed. But that matters not. I merely contend that the Goat King is nothing before the Crocodile King.
:'''Intef:''' The Crocodile King, superior? Al-Ahmar above, grant this person eyes to see the many texts we have collected here!
:'''Charmian:''' And what of them? Do any of them say that they were of equal worth?
:'''Intef:''' None say that they were not.
:'''Charmian:''' *sigh* Come on, you've got to listen to me...
