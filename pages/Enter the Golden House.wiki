* The mark can be removed by touching the arena's barrier to trigger a [[Vaporize]] reaction. This reaction does not deal DMG to the character.
* The mark can also be removed with characters that apply certain elements to themselves or other characters.

==Strategy==
Childe's boss fight heavily revolves around the Riptide mechanic. Without Riptide, Childe will perform relatively weak basic attacks that are easy to evade. However, if a player is marked with Riptide, he will start to utilize extremely strong AoE attacks, some capable of insta-killing most characters. Therefore, for the entire duration of the fight, it is always important to dodge as many of his basic attacks as possible. If Riptide is applied, one's priority should be to remove it as soon as possible using the arena barriers or certain character abilities.

===Phases===
Childe's attacks in his first two phases are punishing on close-range fighters, giving little space and time to dodge. However, he has no "instant-wipe" attack from taking too long to defeat him, so a player can take as much time as they want whittling down his health. Food and potions are very useful, and it is a good idea to stock up on stat-increasing food like [[Adeptus' Temptation]].

====Phase 1====
The player will initially be positioned at the edge of the arena, and Childe will be non-hostile in the center until approached/engaged (this is also the case for his third phase). You can use this opportunity to heal/eat/buff/etc. or change your artifacts/weapons without stress before engaging.

* Many of the ranged attacks in his first phase can be dodged by running in a circle around him. Dashing is usually unnecessary, so it is best to conserve stamina for his more powerful attacks, such as the '''Ultima''' attacks.
* In Co-Op, he can be stun-locked by repeatedly attacking him before he can attack.
* '''Ultima: Celestial Voyager''' will hit twice: once when it is summoned, and once when it lands. Both have a similar radius, but target different parts of the arena. Stay away from the landing zone to avoid taking DMG from the second part of the attack. Running to the edge of the arena will take the player out of the landing radius.

====Phase 2====
During Phase 2, Childe will start moving around more, actively chasing the player, and utilize fast {{Electro}} attacks. Upon transitioning to this phase, Childe will dash to the center of the arena, causing a large Hydro AoE knock-back at the center of the arena that does not deal DMG. Note that in this phase, staying near the arena's barriers is extremely dangerous, as Childe's rapid Electro attacks will cause knockback through the [[Overloaded]] reaction if the player is currently affected by Pyro. The same applies for standing inside [[Bennett]]'s [[Fantastic Voyage]] AoE.

* To dodge the entire 5-strikes of the '''Melee Combo''', the player must outrun the first 3 attacks and use a well-timed [[Sprinting#Dash|Dash]] to avoid the 4th.
* To dodge '''Chained Dashes''' attacks, the player should walk in a medium-sized circle and dash only when necessary.
* '''Ultima: Dark Leap''' is difficult to dodge and is usually a near instant-kill for your on-field character. As soon as Childe initiates this attack, the player should move towards the edge of the arena to cleanse the Riptide mark along with the tracking circle, then immediately exit the attack's AoE. If these steps cannot be performed in time, the player can use a well-timed Elemental Burst i-frame to nullify the DMG.

====Phase 3====
Upon transitioning to this phase, you will be repositioned to the second arena's edge, with Childe remaining initially non-hostile in the center until approached/engaged. You can use this opportunity to heal/eat/buff/etc. without stress before engaging in the final phase.

In Phase 3, Childe's attacks are much slower than in the 1st and 2nd phases, making it easy to attack him up close. However, if not dodged, these attacks will also deal higher DMG. He will use both new attacks and attacks from the earlier phases. Childe primarily uses Electro against players close to him, and Hydro against those out of range.

* When '''Ultima: God Arrow''' is used, blue circles will appear on the floor. Go to the middle or around the four cardinal edges of the arena to avoid this attack. It is especially important to avoid standing in areas where two strike zones overlap, as players in these areas will take DMG twice.

===Recommended Characters===
* Non-{{Hydro}} or {{Electro}} DMG dealers are always effective against Childe independent of his element.
* Ranged characters can attack from a safe range, especially during Phase 1.
* [[Jean]] and [[Bennett]] are capable of cleansing Childe's Riptide mark using their Elemental Bursts (Jean's Elemental Burst will take at least five Swirls before it can remove it, Bennett's Burst will cause Overloaded on the player).
* Abilities such as [[Xiao]]'s [[Bane of All Evil]], [[Kaedehara Kazuha|Kazuha]]'s [[Chihayaburu]], [[Venti]]'s [[Skyward Sonnet]] and climbable [[Geo Constructs]] can be used to avoid many of Childe's powerful attacks which lack vertical AoE such as '''Ultima: Dark Leap'''.
* As usual, [[Healing|healers]] and [[Shields|shielders]] can effectively improve the player's survivability.

==Trivia==
* In phase one of the fight, Childe can form a bow made of pure {{Hydro}}, making this the third time Childe uses a different bow.
** The bow used in the first phase is not currently usable by the player.
** We also see this bow in the third phase when Childe activates Foul Legacy: The Devouring Deep. This time the bow is made of Foul Legacy shards instead of pure {{Hydro}}.
* The move Ultima: Celestial Voyager shows a creature that seems to be a fusion between a humpback whale and a narwhal.
** Childe's English Constellation is Monoceros Caeli. When translated from Latin it means "Celestial Narwhal". The Chinese name for his constellation is {{zh|鲸天座}}, meaning literally "Whale Sky Constellation." This explains why the attack looks like a whale but has the horn of a narwhal.
* His listed abilities are directly taken from the story boss version. Instead of striking six times, he only strikes thrice; as of the nerf.
* The Trounce Domain version of Childe does not perform Ultima: God Arrow during the first phase<!-- This might be false, needs to be tested-->.
* In Childe's first and third phase, if the player does not move from the domain spawn point, Childe will neither move nor attack until the player initiates.
** This is also the case in Co-Op Mode, which can be useful if players are still in the loading screen.

===Known Issues===
* If players are hit while affected by {{Pyro}}, Childe's mark may not disappear when running up to the barrier to remove it. However, this is just a visual bug, and the actual effect will no longer be active.
* A rare bug may occur during [[Co-Op Mode]] where if players either have a slow internet connection or try to rematch Childe, he may not attack at all throughout the fight in which case he can not enter his Second Phase.
* Childe's {{Hydro}} status effects may remain active after he activates his second phase.
