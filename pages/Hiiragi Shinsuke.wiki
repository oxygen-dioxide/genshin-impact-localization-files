'''Hiiragi Shinsuke''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in [[Chapter II]], Act I: [[The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia]].

He is the head of the [[Hiiragi Clan]] and has a daughter, [[Hiiragi Chisato]].

==Profile==
Hiiragi Shinsuke is the head of the Hiiragi Clan and is the [[Kanjou Commission]]er. When the [[Fatui]] arrived on [[Inazuma]] to cause havoc, they also conspired with [[Kujou Takayuki]], the [[Tenryou Commission]]er to manipulate the [[Raiden Shogun]] to enact the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] and [[Sakoku Decree]] to create a market for [[Delusions]]. Shinsuke was also roped into the plot and promised power and wealth, which he accepted by stockpiling [[Crystal Marrow]] for the Fatui.

Shinsuke met with [[Signora]] prior to the [[Traveler]]'s arrival on [[Ritou]] and plotted with her to keep them indefinitely stuck on the island to prevent them from meddling in their affairs. This failed due to his daughter, Chisato, who overheard them and snuck the Traveler off Ritou under the guise of an escort. After the Traveler unraveled the plot, Shinsuke was imprisoned for his role and is awaiting punishment from the Shogun.

===Personality===
Shinsuke initially appears to be a polite gentleman, treating the Traveler and Paimon as honored guests and praising the Traveler for their good deeds in [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]]. However, he turns out to be a deceptive snake who purposefully attempted to give the Traveler impossible errands in order to preventing them from leaving Ritou and was colluding with the Fatui for profits at the expense of Inazuma's public safety.

===Appearance===
Shinsuke wears a gray kimono with a black {{w|hakama}} (trousers) and a red {{w|haori}} (jacket worn over a kimono).
