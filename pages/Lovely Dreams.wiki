==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Unexpectedly, the final clue leads back to Mt. Aocang. Did Yuandai once live there? Why didn't Cloud Retainer mention this? Either way, time to head back there and see if Yuandai recalls anything.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the center of the pond at Mt. Aocang)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, just tell Paimon already! What's this thing you've prepared?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Here. This is it.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But isn't this the mechanism that you were tinkering with when we first got here? Is it another invention of yours?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Precisely. A recent one at that. I am most pleased with the result. I call it the "Suspensus Somnium Mechanism."
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' It periodically releases a soft breeze which, when paired with a gentle adeptal tune, can help the listener subconsciously relax, and even enter a semi-hypnotic state.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Soothing agitation and anxiety, relieving exhaustion and insomnia... Its potential uses are numerous indeed. And of course, it can also aid in the recovery of lost memories.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, what a cool gadget! But if you had it all along, why did you keep it to yourself until just now?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We could have come to Mt. Aocang right off the bat and saved Paimon a lot of floating!
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' How preposterous. Had Yuandai not recalled much of her past through her own efforts, the device would have nothing to draw upon.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' We adepti can only help those who first resolve to help themselves. Had she lacked such determination and strength of character, one would have little to offer in way of assistance.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks she gets it now... Hey, what's that other thing?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 07.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' As previously mentioned, a gentle adeptal tune is required to take full advantage of the mechanism. One secured such a tune from Streetward Rambler. Only with her melodies can the mechanism reach its peak power.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah... Paimon can feel what you mean! Paimon's body feels light as a feather &mdash; it's as if she's lying down on a warm patch of grass after a super satisfying meal... *yawn*...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 08.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' And you, Yuandai? Is the mechanism helping you to relax?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' ...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 09.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' It appears she has already succumbed to the depths of reverie. Come, join one on this side. We shall give her some time to herself.
:;(Everyone steps away from Yuandai)
:;(Yuandai begins to relive her memories)
:;(A man appears behind her)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 qingchenmiddleage 01.ogg}} '''???:''' The drought is over... But why do you look like you want to cry?
:;(The man disappears and a younger version of Yuandai appears nearby)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandaimiddleage 01.ogg}} '''???:''' The potion... It's nearly run its course...
:;(She disappears and the same man, now older, appears before her)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 qingchenoldage 01.ogg}} '''???:''' I've never regretted meeting you... not even for a second.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandaioldage 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Please... Please, no...
:;(A younger Yuandai speaks to her)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandaiyoung 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Have you forgotten?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandaiyoung 02.ogg}} '''???:''' This is the world you left behind, one of gentle breeze and morning dew, perfectly straddled betwixt the realms of heaven and earth...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandaiyoung 03.ogg}} '''???:''' This is your home. This is where you belong. You should have never left... The "you" of the past... the "me" from not that long ago... We should have never...
:;(The younger Yuandai is revealed to be a white crane and disappears)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Ah... Ahhhh...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 03.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' So that is the truth... No wonder this place is so familiar. I&mdash;
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Granny!
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Granny! Are you okay!?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 04.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Cloud... Retainer...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 10.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 11.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Your memories have returned?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, did you just call her by her full name? Does that mean...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You already knew each other!?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 05.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Yes. I now remember everything. Everything...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 shuyu 02.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Granny, please don't cry. I'm here, I'm here...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 06.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Don't worry, my dear child. Granny is fine...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 07.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I'm so sorry, everyone. You've gone to so much trouble on my behalf...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 08.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' It's all come back to me now. The most important thing that I had forgotten... was the truth of "what I once was."
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 12.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' *sigh* One can sense the guilt that now plagues your conscience. Reclaiming a truth long buried is sure to come with a myriad of complex emotions. Perhaps one should recount the story on your behalf while you compose yourself?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 09.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' No, it's okay. Now that I've remembered, I must face my memories head-on.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 10.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Shuyu, everyone... I cannot thank you enough for all your help. I'm ready to tell you my story... if you're willing to listen.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 shuyu 03.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Please, Granny, don't force yourself. What happened in the past doesn't matter... I love you more than anything. Nothing you say can change that.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 11.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I know, dear child. My feelings for you are exactly the same... It is for this reason that you deserve to know the truth.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 12.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Some time ago, I made a terrible mistake... One for which I could never atone.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this the "sin" that you mentioned in Jueyun Karst? What happened?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 13.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' ...I am, in truth, not a human being. My real form &mdash; one that I held for centuries &mdash; was that of a wild crane.
:;(An [[Azure Crane]] lands in the foreground)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 14.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I spent many, many years living on Mt. Aocang, bathing in the soft breeze and drinking the sweet dew of the mountains. At some point, I somehow gained wisdom and sentience. The lord of the mountain, Cloud Retainer, became aware of my existence and began to share many stories with me. She even passed on the secret of cultivation to me.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 15.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Though she never took me on as a formal disciple, I always saw her as my Master. Whenever she took out her tools to work on mechanisms or new inventions, I would also stand next to her and watch.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 16.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I even contemplated completing my training and becoming an adeptus in my own right. I followed her teachings, and time gradually passed us by... until that fateful day fifty years ago.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fifty years ago?
:{{DIcon}} During the drought that struck Liyue?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 17.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' That's right. Master regaled me with many stories of her past deeds. From them, I learned how she had saved people from a similar crisis in the past.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 18.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' She was the one I looked up to the most. More than anything, I dreamt of becoming an adeptus like her. I wanted to travel the land like she had, relieving suffering wherever I went.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 19.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' But I was still far from being a real adeptus. I possessed no ability to take on human form and fit in with the crowd. Once she learned of my desires, Master prepared a special dose of Human Mimicry Potion for me.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 20.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' She warned me that the potion's effects would only last ten years, and if I were to fail to return to my original form at the end of that time, I would forever forget my past as a crane, and become something neither human, beast, nor adeptus.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... So that was... the source of your "dementia" all along?
:{{DIcon}} But you never turned back into a crane...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 shuyu 04.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Was it because of Grandpa?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 21.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Indeed. I fell in love... Though he was human, he had spent his entire life training on Mt. Tianheng. When we met, it was not only my first foray into the world below, but his as well.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 22.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Although clumsy and impulsive as he was, you'd think he was the real "strange bird" among the two of us. But still, just like me, he cared deeply about the world, and wanted, more than anything, to cleanse it of all pain and suffering.
:;(Yuandai has a flashback of her and Shuyu's grandfather, the man who appeared in her memories before)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 23.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I could not help but fall for him. But my time continued to tick away... Those ten years passed by in a flash. Yet I did not want to leave his side, so I... I...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... What happened next?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 24.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' ... I committed an offense. I wanted to stay with him, even if it meant living a life full of pain and suffering, even if it meant that I would eventually turn into a monstrosity.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 25.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I knew I had betrayed Master's hopes, but I was too ashamed to face her. So I wrote her a long letter instead and asked someone to leave it outside her abode.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 26.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I was convinced that she would not support my decision, and I lacked the courage to speak to her face-to-face. In my shame, I fled and tried to hide from the world, such that no one would be able to find me again.
:{{DIcon}} So that's why...
:{{DIcon}} The nameless heroine hid herself away...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 27.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' But that was only the beginning of my troubles. I began to suffer from a strange illness. My memories became hazy and confused, and I could no longer keep myself awake. I understood that my pain was caused by my refusal to return to the life I was fated to lead.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 28.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Along with my memories as a crane, I soon forgot the true cause of my suffering as well. I knew only that I had committed a sin. All I could do was pray for forgiveness, even if I had long forgotten what needed to be forgiven.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 29.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Looking back, I was beyond lucky to have come across that traveling merchant at Wangshu Inn. It was such a fortunate coincidence that we were there at the same time. If it weren't for those Soul-Revitalizing Teapills, I probably would have&mdash;
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 30.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' ...!
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 shuyu 05.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Granny! What's wrong?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 31.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' ...Coincidence? Why did I ever think it was a coincidence? Teapills concocted using the blood of an adeptus... No... It couldn't be&mdash;
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 32.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Master. Don't tell me... Back then, that merchant was actually&mdash;
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 13.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 14.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Human custom would dictate the conferral of gifts to be in order when one's progeny is wedded, would it not? Consider the pills a symbol of one's best wishes.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 yuandai 33.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Ahh... So when I tried to conceal my name and mistakes from the world, and hide myself away in perpetuity, the only person I managed to deceive.... was myself. You knew where I was all along.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 15.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One still remembers when you were but a fledgling, you possessed a certain fondness for a particular game. You would hide yourself among a group of wild cranes and ask one to pick you out from among the flock.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 16.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One found you with such ease every time. 'Tis a truth most evident: One always recognizes one's own... no matter what form they may take.
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait wait wait, Paimon's confused!
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... Cloud Retainer, you found Yuandai again? But how? When? And what happened after that?
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 17.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Hah. Perhaps it is now time for one to recount the rest of the tale.

;(Talk to Xianyun if the player exited the Domain)
:{{A|vo lylq003 1 xianyun 17.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Hah. Perhaps it is now time for one to recount the rest of the tale.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Sure.
:{{DIcon}} Please wait a moment.

{{Quest Description|Yuandai seems to have recalled her past memories. A tale of love and guilt comes spilling forth, but this seems to not be the full truth. What else did Cloud Retainer do in those bygone days?}}
;(Walk through the cave in the domain)
:{{A|vo lylq003 2 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One was furious upon receiving your letter. Seized with anger, one set out to bring you to your senses.

;(Approach the dock)
:{{A|vo lylq003 3 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' In truth, one had more than a few misgivings about your chosen partner. As an exorcist, his talent was lacking. One could hardly say his skill with sigils was any better.
:{{A|vo lylq003 3 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' But soon, one came to appreciate the devotion he bestowed upon you during your illness. He never uttered a complaint and rarely left your side.
:{{A|vo lylq003 3 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Unwilling to begrudge someone of such character, one decided to overlook his aforementioned deficiencies... glaring though they may have been.
:{{A|vo lylq003 3 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Wishing to grant you a life without regrets, one gathered many divine ingredients and used one's own blood to create a form of medicine. Though imperfect, it managed to suppress the more dire effects of your illness.
:{{A|vo lylq003 3 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' As for how to deliver the medicine... After much contemplation, one eventually decided to perform the deed oneself.

:{{A|vo lylq003 3 xianyun 07.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' As one expected, you were most ignorant of one's true identity. You showed not even the slightest inkling of recognition.
:{{A|vo lylq003 3 xianyun 08.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' *sigh* One was quite torn... Should one have celebrated the success of one's disguise, or mourned the loss of your acquaintance?

;(Approach the Exquisite Chest)
:{{A|vo lylq003 4 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Nevertheless, one would speak to you about another matter, if you are amenable.
:{{A|vo lylq003 4 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Even considering your loss of memory, one was simply flabbergasted that you could so easily forget the consequences of consuming medicine infused with adeptal blood. Its proclivity to attract monsters is hardly that complicated of a concept to remember.

At the break of dawn, one heard an infant's cry pierce through the air, and one saw you carefully cradle the child to your chest. Although certain mortal matters remain foreign to me, one could not help but be moved by your joy.
:{{A|vo lylq003 5 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' To see you happy, that was more than enough.

:{{A|vo lylq003 7 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One had no choice but to apply powder to one's body to conceal the variegated nature of one's appearance. You became more than amenable enough when one stood before you devoid of any other coloring.

:{{A|vo lylq003 7 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' It bears mentioning, however, that as a crane, Yuandai was nearly entirely pure white in color. Though you had never encountered her in that form, you still recognized the essence of her being...

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Now all has been revealed.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One owes you an apology, Yuandai. One recognized you upon your very entrance into Wanmin Restaurant.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has always viewed you as a disciple of equal standing with [[Ganyu]] and [[Shenhe]]. Indeed, one wished to bring your story to a satisfactory end with this visit to Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Still, one could not reveal your identity right away. Had one simply informed you of all you had lost, all those cherished memories would merely have become the fictionalized account of another.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Memories are most meaningful when recalled by the those who lived through them, would you not agree? Even if the process was painful and arduous to experience. Have you any further inquiries?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Master... I...
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I must ask... If you found me all those years ago, why did you leave me be even though you knew about my mistake? Why did you not bring me back to Mt. Aocang by force?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has never regarded your action as a mistake. It was a simple choice, nothing more.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 07.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' When it is time for one's progeny to leave the nest, it is the responsibility of an elder to let them fly free. Yet when your wings grow weary and the night grows dark, just know that you always have a place to which to return.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 08.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Tis a refuge referred to by many a name in mortal writing: "Home," "nest," "haven"... Whatever its denomination may be, its essence remains quite unchanged.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 09.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One speaks, of course, of a place not unlike one's own abode. One's disciples are free to come and go as they wish, yet the door remains forever open to those who wish to return... One rather hopes you count yourself among them.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 yuandai 03.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Th&mdash;Thank you... I just... Thank you so much...
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 10.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Yuandai.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 11.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One expects you, too, have sensed the rapid deterioration of your condition as of late, have you not?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 12.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Forty years ago, you chose a path without a future. Though one used one's own blood to provide you with a few decades of extra time, it merely delayed the inevitable. One may have extended the path, yet one was unable to alter its final destination.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 13.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Even the power of an adeptus has its limits. Had your condition continued to deteriorate, you would have forgotten your life as a human entirely. In the end, you would have turned into a creature lacking in the ability to even comprehend its own monstrousness.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 14.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Fortunately, you were able to avoid that scenario by reclaiming your memories. Though one sped the process along by providing some guidance, the result is entirely a reflection of your own effort.

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 15.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One will help her reclaim her original form as a wild crane. If it be fated, she may recover her sentience one day.

:{{DIcon}} Is there no other way?

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 yuandai 05.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I don't know how I can possibly repay your kindness. This is a better result than I could have ever hoped for... How much time do I have left?

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 shuyu 02.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Granny... Please don't leave, okay? You're all I have left... Please...
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 yuandai 06.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Don't be sad, dear child. Granny has led a wonderful life... My only regret is having to leave you behind.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 yuandai 07.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Don't forget to eat well, okay? A growing young lady like yourself needs lots of good food to grow big and strong. Promise Granny you'll take good care of yourself when I'm gone...

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 yuandai 08.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Good girl, good girl... Don't worry. It's not goodbye forever. Granny's gonna become the most formidable crane in all of Mt. Aocang. Granny will train day and night...

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shuyu...
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 17.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Let her be. At her age, crying is a natural, if not fitting, response to such an event.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 18.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Tears are a necessary part of maturation. Sometimes, there is scarcely a better vehicle to wash away the toll of stress and misery.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 19.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Now that the issue has been resolved, you should also take a moment to relax. Give yourself some time to rest, take a nap if you must. One will wake you in due time.

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 21.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Oh? And have you reasons for this sudden interest?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 shuyu 10.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I know Granny thought that what she did back then was wrong. She felt really bad about it.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 shuyu 11.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' But... Without that mistake, I would have never been born.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 shuyu 12.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Even though Granny lost her memories, she never forgot to show me how much she loved me. So, I thought maybe one day...
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 shuyu 13.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I could become a cool adeptus like you and help a whole bunch of people, just like Granny wanted to do!
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 22.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Upon some reflection, one supposes you are no mere mortal. The fact that Yuandai's blood flows through your veins is proof enough of that... If this is what you desire, one shall make it so.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 shuyu 14.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Thank you so much, Madame Adeptus! No, uh, I mean, Master!
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Shuyu, are you sure about this?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna let you in on a little secret... We've seen Cloud Retainer's two other disciples, and they pretty much eat nothing but bitter herbs like Qingxin and Violetgrass!
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you join them, you'll never enjoy Wanmin Restaurant's delicious cooking ever again!
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 23.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmph, how utterly preposterous. One has never enforced such a rule.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 24.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Every individual must find their own path to enlightenment. So long as one retains a pureness of spirit, one's dietary proclivities are quite irrelevant.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you say that, but Paimon's not seeing any tasty treats up here, now is she?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 25.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Although Mt. Aocang is rich in natural beauty, its location does preclude access to certain finer mortal comforts.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 26.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' That is precisely why one plans to relocate to Liyue Harbor. Shuyu shall have the honor of becoming one's first disciple in the human world.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, you're leaving Mt. Aocang?
:{{DIcon}} Is that why you took on this human form?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 27.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has never concerned oneself with the location of one's residence. From the very beginning, one has sought only solace and peace.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 28.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Yet, in the end, all of one's disciples ended up in Liyue Harbor. Ganyu, Shenhe... Yuandai... They all chose a life among the mortal world.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 29.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has reflected on this fact for many years now. One can only assume that it is due to some failing on one's part as an elder or master, a failing, perhaps, of recognizing what it was they truly wanted.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 30.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One is most curious as to what aspect of Liyue Harbor could have enticed them to remain there. One could hardly offer an opinion on the matter, but perhaps some time in the harbor will prove instructive.

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon is, uh, just a bit shocked, that's all... So does this mean we can grab a meal together in Liyue Harbor some time?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 32.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmph! One has precious little time to squander! However... If one finds oneself otherwise unoccupied, one would not be opposed to the idea.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 33.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One will be assuming the identity of a human while residing in Liyue Harbor. You should take care to avoid disclosing one's true identity.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry! We'll help you keep it a secret.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So uh... when can we expect to start seeing you in the city?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 34.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Perhaps in two day's time. One has some matters to see to before one's departure. Preparation is the key to success, after all. One plans to put up various items from one's collection for sale. The earnings should provide for a comfortable living in Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 35.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has already picked out a handsome property near Chihu Rock. 'Tis no small purchase, but what is mortal life if not one expense after another...

:{{A|vo lylq003 8 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then... How about we meet up in Liyue Harbor in two days?
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 36.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' A sensible plan. See you then.
:{{A|vo lylq003 8 xianyun 37.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Oh, also &mdash; why don't you take this Suspensus Somnium Mechanism as a souvenir? Any time you should feel ill at ease in the future, you may try quieting your mind and sitting in meditation as you listen to its melodies. It might help you find a new perspective.

:{{A|vo dialog lylq003 shuyu 02.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I don't think she'd want too many people to know. They might go to Mt. Aocang and start bugging her about it. Granny needs to focus on her training, y'know? But, telling a friend or two is probably fine.

:{{A|vo dialog lylq003 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Ah, I see... So the stories didn't get it right after all. Even though she was a celebrated heroine, she had to bear a heavy burden that most could not hope to understand.

:{{A|vo dialog lylq003 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Although I cannot claim to know exactly how their story will unfold from here, I trust the ending will be a happy one. Those united in a common purpose always find a way back to each other in the end.

:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 02.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' In what way are any of these "ordinary"!? Every single item here could be worth more than everything I own combined! I simply can't risk shelling out that kind of Mora without proper scrutiny. If I'm wrong, I would never be able to earn it back, not even if I worked every single day for the rest of my life.

:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hear that? Had I not found myself in need of Mora, I would scarcely have had the heart to part with them. Indeed, you should consider it an honor to even have the opportunity to behold them with your own eyes.

:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 08.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmph! Do I "know how to make clothes"? With the support of the proper mechanism, sewing is hardly a challenge.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shuyu 03.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Master, I brought in most of my stuff. There's a few boxes left, but they're kinda heavy, so I just left them outside...
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 09.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Fret not. I shall help you move them into your room.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shuyu 04.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' A&mdash;Actually, I should probably, uh, sort through my stuff a bit first. Everything's kinda... messy right now, so maybe you could, um, not look yet, Master? Yeah, that'd be great...
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 10.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Heh. It appears my young apprentice has her own fair share of secrets. No matter &mdash; do what you must, child.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 11.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Now, this "expert" you mentioned... When can we expect their arrival?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 06.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Soon, soon... Ah! There he is!
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 07.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Here, allow me to make some introductions! This is Mr. Zhongli, a well-respected consultant at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and an expert in all manner of valuables and antiques!
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 08.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Mr. Zhongli... This is Ms. Xianyun. She's the one who's looking to sell the collection of valuables I mentioned earlier.
:;(There is a brief, awkward pause between the [[archon]] and adeptus.)
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 12.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, if it isn't Ms. Xianyun. It has been quite some time since our last meeting. What a serendipitous reunion.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 13.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Ahem, in&mdash;indeed, most serendipitous. Have you been faring well as of late, Mr. Zhongli?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Quite well, thank you. I was fortunate enough over the past few days to enjoy both a stroll in the mountains and a fresh brew of tea from the most recent harvest. The experiences left me with much insight and peace.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 09.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Huh... So you two are already acquainted?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. How fortunate we are that fate has brought us together again. As for the matter at hand... If you are otherwise unaware, allow me to inform you that Ms. Xianyun is a well-regarded collector and appraiser. She is well-versed in all fields and oft-celebrated for her impeccable taste. You stand to gain much from this opportunity.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 14.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' You are too kind, Mr. Zhongli. True collectors pride themselves on their wealth of knowledge and eye for detail. I can say without a doubt that you are foremost in that regard.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Why, you flatter me, Ms. Xianyun. It would seem that you are as self-effacing as ever.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 15.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Not at all, Mr. Zhongli, not at all.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 10.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 11.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' While I am loath to butt into this conversation, I must ask...
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 12.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' You two already knew each other, and you... seem to have quite a cordial relationship... Can I be certain that you're not working together to swindle me? I mean, you never know, haha...
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 16.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hah, a preposterous accusation! The heavens themselves would collapse before we would conspire to do such a thing!
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ms. Xianyun speaks the truth. Contracts are built on honesty and trust. If that proves to be beyond your capabilities in this instance, this transaction may be taken elsewhere.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 17.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Say no more. Let us depart.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 13.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' A&mdash;Ah, I jest, I jest! What fool would still harbor doubts after Mr. Zhongli himself has vouched for the goods? Ms. Xianyun, Ms. Xianyun, wait&mdash;!
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:;(A while later)
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 14.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Ahem... I deeply apologize for doubting you. So, um, Mr. Zhongli... Could you please give me a final verdict on the value of these items?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' There is no cause for concern. They are indeed rare and precious valuables. Take this mechanism, for instance. Though one may not immediately perceive its purpose, its structure and appearance are exquisite enough to merit it a place in any fine home.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The same can be said for this one here. Few could hope to possess an item that so perfectly blends mechanical wonder with geometric grace.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I am sure you have heard from your travels that the study of mechanisms is among the most wondrous arts in this world. With that in mind, I earnestly recommend procuring every last item in this collection.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 15.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Alright! Since I hired you as my consultant, Mr. Zhongli, I shall, of course, trust your good opinion.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 16.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Then, in that case, Ms. Xianyun, I'll take the lot. However... since the final sum is quite large, how about we start with an initial deposit through the Northland Bank?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 18.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' The Northland Bank? Oh, you refer to the fiduciary house. Very well.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shaozu 17.ogg}} '''Shaozu:''' Haha, I fear people only use the term "bank" nowadays. In that case, I'll be off for now. I'll return to collect the goods once you've received the funds.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 19.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' *snore* *snore*
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli!
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' My friends. Have you been doing well?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been great! How about you? Paimon didn't know you were such a busy consultant!
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' My days have been quite pleasant as well. I had been quietly enjoying a cup of tea when Mr. Shaozu requested my services.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As for you, Ms. Xianyun... I presume you must be looking to settle in the city?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 20.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...I must say, the name "Xianyun" sounds exceedingly strange coming from you. Perhaps you could dispense of that particular epithet in further conversation.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Whatever for? Am I not addressing you as a friend should?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 21.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Well, that is true, but&mdash;
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 22.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' *sigh* Alas, refer to me however you will. After all, a name exists such that others may address you with it. One is hardly ignorant of that fact.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Haha, it would seem that you have gained many valuable insights over the years, Cloud Retainer.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 23.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has, indeed. One's previous stays were all brief. Now that one has made up one's mind to move and settle, one has gained a much better appreciation of the hubbub and commotion of the city, as well as the people's hard work and ardor.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 24.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' This city... is much changed from how it was more than a thousand years ago.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Not unlike the ocean tides, so too shall the movement of people ebb and flow. From turmoil to peace, enlightenment to aspiration &mdash; human society possesses limitless potential. In another thousand years, the scene we witness here may change in ways that are impossible for either of us to imagine.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, that's enough reflection for one day! No need to get all sentimental on us.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 25.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' You make a valid point, Paimon. Now that the sale has concluded, what say one plays the host as we try some specialty dishes together? One must profess great interest in trying "[[Bamboo Shoot Soup]]."
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hmm? Perhaps you have forgotten, Cloud Retainer, but I once tried my hand at that dish. You were at the table on that occasion, so logic dictates that you should have already tried it.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 26.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Oh? ... What occasion was this?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It was a reunion between friends several centuries ago. Alas, you must have been too preoccupied to secure yourself a portion. Or perhaps our other companions simply availed themselves of faster reflexes on that occasion.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 27.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Ha! Hardly! 'Twas most certainly out of consideration for the others in attendance. In but a moment, one will show you what it means to have a true deftness of hand.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 28.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' It is settled, then. Bamboo Shoot Soup, [[Mora Meat]], [[Crab Roe Tofu]], [[Triple-Layered Consommé]]... We shall enjoy the lot.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 29.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has already passed word to Shenhe and Ganyu to make a reservation. It is prime time for them to meet one's newest disciple. Is that agreeable to everyone?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It should be a most splendid occasion.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you so much, Cloud Retainer!
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 30.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Shuyu! Come now, it is time to dine. Ah, this gentleman over here is Mr. Zhongli, He is... Erm...
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' A humble employee of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shuyu 05.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Nice to meet you too, Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That should be everyone, right? Let's go!
:;(As Shuyu begins speaking, Xianyun starts walking down the street, followed by Shuyu, Zhongli, and the Traveler.)
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 shuyu 06.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Sounds good! Actually, Master, have you ever tried "[[Adeptus' Temptation]]"? I heard it's impossible to stop eating after even just one bite! Y'know, cause it's super tempting and stuff. Is that true?
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 xianyun 31.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmm, that sounds rather implausible. Although, with the right preparation, certain dishes can be too delicious to resist...
:;(The camera switches to Paimon, who has been left behind.)
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why are you all walking so fast? Hey, wait for Paimon!
:{{A|vo lylq003 13 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, hey, wait up!
:;(Quest ends)

;(Interact with the Unsigned Letter on Shuyu's boxes, optional)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What seems like a book of accounts. A letter can also be found inside.)
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' Little Yu, my dear daughter... By the time you read this, Mommy and Daddy will have already left to go on a long journey.
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' Your Granny may get a little forgetful sometimes, so try to jot down little reminders for her around the house whenever you can. Mommy and Daddy are counting on you to take care of Granny while we're gone!
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' You might be wondering why Mommy and Daddy have to leave. Well, my dear daughter, in this world, everyone's got something that they just have to do. Your Mommy and Daddy are no different!
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' Did you know? Daddy was actually awfully sick as a child. How sick, you might ask? Well, even the doctor could barely feel Daddy's pulse, it was that weak!
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' But Daddy still managed to grow up. Looking back, there were many times when Daddy thought he might not make it. In the end, though, Daddy pushed through every time. Pretty amazing, if you think about it.
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' Maybe Daddy is just really lucky. Or, who knows, maybe he has some super powerful adeptus looking out for him? Either way, Daddy has always felt like he's received a lot of love from this world.
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' And you know what? Daddy loves this world right back. They told Daddy that this mission would be super dangerous, but both Mommy and Daddy decided to sign up.
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' You'll have grown quite a bit taller the next time Mommy and Daddy see you again. Maybe you'll be so big by then that Mommy and Daddy won't even recognize you.
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' How about this? Let's use a code! Do you still remember that one phrase Daddy taught you when you were little? That can be our secret code the next time we see each other again. That way, we'll recognize each other no matter what. You remember it, don't you?
:'''Unsigned Letter:''' While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
