{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Orqo)
;(If the player has not already collected all the star shards)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, what are you doing here?
::'''???:''' ...Whoa! You scared me half to death! What if I fell? How would you pay me back? My hidden powers haven't been awakened yet, you know, I'm just a helpless little child.
::'''Paimon:''' Ah! Sorry, Paimon didn't mean to give you a fright! But... hidden powers? Would you develop some super duper ultimate technique or something?
::'''???:''' Look, it's called a "hidden" power for a reason. If it's hidden, how the heck would I know what it is?
::{{DIcon}} He's got a point.
::{{DIcon}} So young, yet so full of baloney.
::'''???:''' Look, let's put all that to the side for now. Can you help me find the star shards? I've saved up quite a bit of pocket money from helping out Mama Coco, and you can have every last Mora.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, since you're asking us for help, could you at least tell us your name? By the way, Paimon's Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}.
::'''Orqo:''' The name I use now is nothing but a code name, that's all... But everyone calls me Orqo, so you might as well too. Now, about those star shards, will you help?
::'''Paimon:''' Though... Just what is a star shard? Doesn't sound like it's something you can come by too easily.
::'''Orqo:''' They're shards split off from stars that fell from the sky! As long as you find them {{sic|at|expected=and}} return them to their original spot, you can regain the power that was lost.
::'''Orqo:''' Look! A fallen star is just down below, so there's gotta be some leads to find star shards down there. C'mon, please gimme a hand!
::'''Paimon:''' Okay, okay, we'll help you out this time! Still, though, star shards and lost power and whatnot... That feels like something out of a novel.
::'''Orqo:''' You've never even heard the story of [[The Tale of Qoyllor and Ukuku|Qoyllor and Ukuku]]? My dad's told me it a million times, I've got it completely memorized. I'd be happy to share it with you!
::'''Orqo:''' But let's go down and take a look together first!
;(If the player has already collected all the star shards) <!-- https://youtu.be/kqeE3PBRkK0 -->
::'''???:''' Wow! Amazing! You guys found all the star shards!
::'''???:''' I've saved up quite a bit of pocket money from helping out Mama Coco. I'll give you every last Mora if you give the shards to me!
::'''Paimon:''' Star shards? What are they for? Uh... And before that, what the heck is a little kid doing out here all alone?
::'''Orqo:''' ...Everyone else calls me Orqo, so you might as well too. Though it's only a codename...
::'''Orqo:''' I'm only here to collect the star shards! You guys saw the big rock down below too, right? That's a star, fallen from the sky!
::'''Orqo:''' As long as we can collect the scattered shards and return them to it, we can gain the power that was lost... Please, I'm begging you, I really do need these star shards...
::{{DIcon}} Sounds pretty dubious...
:::'''Paimon:''' Yeah... But it still counts as a clue, right? Why don't we give it a try and see what happens?
::{{DIcon}} Whoa, that amazing? Okay, I definitely can't give 'em to you now.
:::'''Paimon:''' Hey, he's just a little kid! Ease up a bit. And even though we don't know if it's true or not, why don't we give it a try and see what happens?
::'''Paimon:''' Still, though, star shards and lost power and whatnot... That sounds like something out of a novel.
::'''Orqo:''' You've never even heard the story of Qoyllor and Ukuku? My dad's told me it a million times, I've got it completely memorized. I'd be happy to share it with you!
::'''Orqo:''' But let's go down there together first!
::{{Black Screen|You and Orqo arrive beside the "fallen star"...}}
::'''Orqo:''' C'mon, hurry up and put the fragments back on the star! Wow... I wonder what power will awaken? Maybe I'll even ascend to the sky... Hehe!
::;(Skip to "Talk to Orqo again, optional")

;(Glide to the bottom of the hole)
:'''Orqo:''' Phew! I'd never have made it by myself, thank you!
:'''Paimon:''' So is this the fallen star? If you look at it up close...
:{{DIcon}} Aaaah! A mysterious power is surging through my body!
::'''Paimon:''' Eh!? Really? Hey, wait a sec, we haven't even found the scattered fragments yet!
::'''Paimon:''' Speaking of the fragments, are there really clues to them around here? Paimon doesn't see anything...
:{{DIcon}} What a weird rock.
::'''Paimon:''' It definitely looks peculiar enough... But is Paimon just a bit slow? She doesn't feel any kind of mysterious power from it at all...
:'''Paimon:''' So, what's next?
:'''Orqo:''' We'll have to rely on our raw strength. {{Color|buzzword|Hit it with all the might of a Tepetlisaurus}}, and maybe we'll find out where the missing fragments are.
:'''Orqo:''' Brute force can solve most problems! That's what my dad says. But I still haven't awoken my strength, and I don't have my own Saurian either... So you're all I've got.

;(Talk to Orqo, optional)
:'''Orqo:''' Dad'll be happy, for sure...

;(Break the rock)
:'''Orqo:''' Look! That shining patch on the wall, that's gotta be the lost fragments. They're responding to the call of the stars!

;(Retrieve the Star Shard)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Star Shard}})
----
;(Talk to Orqo after collecting three Star Shards)
:'''Paimon:''' That should be all, right? This commission was way easier than Paimon thought it'd be! Still, do miraculous powers like that exist? Paimon was pretty skeptical before...
:{{DIcon}} Want to awaken some hidden powers too, do you?
:'''Paimon:''' Of course! Wouldn't it make things really easy if you had, say, a super treasure-seeking ability or the power to just destroy any monster with one punch? C'mon, {{Traveler}}, wouldn't you want that?
:{{DIcon}} I want more poweeer!
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh!
:{{DIcon}} I'm strong enough as-is. I don't need it.
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? But doesn't everyone say that the pursuit of more power is endless?
:'''Orqo:''' C'mon, hurry up and put the fragments back on the star! Wow... I wonder what power will awaken? Maybe I'll even ascend to the sky... Hehe!

;(Talk to Orqo again, optional)
:'''Orqo:''' Hey, what're you waiting for? Hurry up! We've gotta put the scattered fragments back on the star!
----
;(Submit {{Item|Star Shard|x=3}} to the rock)
:'''Orqo:''' Falling stars, show your true power!
:'''Orqo:''' Before you stands a hero who has passed the trial, here to request the reward for courage and loyalty!
----
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, do you feel any unbelievable power?
:{{DIcon}} Not really, no.
:'''Paimon:''' The big rock hasn't changed a bit! No mysterious glow, not even sudden shaking or just cracking right open.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, did we use the wrong incantation? It sounded right to Paimon, though...
:'''Paimon:''' Still, we occasionally run into situations like this when we're exploring ruins! If you misremember the password or signal, the mechanism just won't respond.
:'''Orqo:''' Weird... I was told saying that stuff would liberate the hidden power...
:'''Orqo:''' And the person who told me closed their eyes and started moaning in pain soon after they recited it! Not only that, but afterward, he gained a "magic eye" that could tell the value of gems!
:{{DIcon}} Wow, so cool!
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? Sounds kinda dubious.
:{{DIcon}} Those symptoms sound familiar...
:'''???:''' Oh my! I've finally found you, you silly little goose! How'd you end up out here? Your father's been worried sick about you!
:'''Orqo:''' I told him I'd go back when it's time to eat! Did he have to tell you...
:'''Mama Coco:''' Still talking back? You two kids down there, don't you tarry either! Who knows what kind of dangers might show up if you dally there!
:{{Black Screen|You bring Orqo back up, and explain the situation...}}
:'''Mama Coco:''' *sigh* Those are just childish fantasies he was talking about. Sorry you had to get involved in his mischief.
:'''Mama Coco:''' He's gotten quite naughty, as nobody really disciplines him. After all, his mother isn't around and his father's eyesight is poor. I try to help out as a neighbor, but I haven't got unlimited energy either.
:'''Paimon:''' Ohh, so that's it! Paimon knew it! There's no way something like that could be true... Imagine just collecting a few stone fragments and getting mysterious powers...
:'''Orqo:''' I'm not being naughty, it's for dad...
:'''Mama Coco:''' Don't be so bird-brained! It's all because you won't listen to those older and wiser. At least you're safe and sound this time, but did you ever stop to think about what would happen if you got into some real trouble someday?
:'''Mama Coco:''' Hmph! Enough. You just behave now and come back with me.
:'''Orqo:''' Fine... But first... Here you go, you two. We did agree. Here's the Mora I promised.
:'''Mama Coco:''' Do take it. We wouldn't want him to be someone who isn't true to their word.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, since you put it that way... We won't say no.
:'''Orqo:''' Yeah, and maybe I'll need your help in the future! We failed this time, but that doesn't mean we won't succeed next time, right?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Huh?
:'''Mama Coco:''' You little munchkin...
:'''Orqo:''' C'mon, Mama Coco. Let's go, my dad's waiting! Thank you both, see you next time!
