==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
Before completing ''The Children of Vimara Village''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Iosaphat:''' Oh, are you a guest from outside the village? If you haven't tried fishing, I implore you give it a try!
:{{DIcon}} I've fished enough.
::'''Iosaphat:''' Haha, the look on your face tells me it's either you dislike fishing, or you're too good at it.
::'''Iosaphat:''' Anyway, one must have a hobby to whittle away free time. I think fishing is a good way to go about that.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe next time.
::'''Iosaphat:''' Sure, let's fish together when you have time!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
After completing ''The Children of Vimara Village''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Iosaphat:''' Isn't this the guest Rana brought? What's up, is something wrong?
:{{DIcon}} About the children...
::'''Iosaphat:''' Oh, those "tiger cubs"... They want to go into the forest every day, but children should have this sort of energy.
::'''Iosaphat:''' Sudabeh and Kavus are just the child-version of me, haha...
::'''Iosaphat:''' But I hope they can be more careful. They have been missing for days before. Everyone in the village was worried sick...
::'''Iosaphat:''' Oh, if only my wife were here... She would be able to keep all the children in line.
::'''Iosaphat:''' But she's a busy researcher. Right now she's in the Akademiya, conducting some sort of research...
:{{DIcon}} About Amadhiah...
::'''Iosaphat:''' Oh, you mean my father. His eyesight has become worse, but he is still hale and hearty otherwise because he wanted to be an adventurer when he was young.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing...
::'''Iosaphat:''' Haha, okay then... By the way, come fishing with me when you get the time!
