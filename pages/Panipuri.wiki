|desc_suspicious = A delicacy served with dipping sauce. The green sauce gives off a slightly unusual smell, and its color looks a bit off... Maybe it is a good idea to forget about the sauce and directly go for the panipuri balls.
|desc_basic      = An appetizer served with a green dipping sauce. The crispy balls are first deep-fried, then stuffed with a delicious filling through a hole on the top. The bite-sized snack is a common street food in Sumeru.
|desc_delicious  = A delicacy that is served with dipping sauce. The round panipuri balls remind you of Slimes. Anticipate the mysterious, bright-colored juice within, and bring it to your mouth — the coolness, sourness, and tingling sensations are bouncing freely on your tongue as if someone has ignited a stick of dreamy dynamite. No wonder that some people in Sumeru are so obsessed with it...
