==Gameplay Notes==

==Trivia==
* The achievement's name, as well as its description and the Hidden Exploration Objective it's tied to, are reference to {{w|Märchen_(album)|Märchen}}, an album by a Japanese band called {{w|Sound Horizon}}.
** The achievement's name, more explicitly in the Japanese version {{Lang|ja=宵闇と暁光の歌|ja_rm=Yoiyami to Gyoukou no Uta}}, is a combination of two song titles from the album: "Yoiyami no Uta" {{lang||ja=宵闇の唄}} and "Gyoukou no Uta" {{lang|ja=暁光の唄}}.
** The achievement's description is likely a reference to a line in "Gyoukou no Uta": 「キミが今笑っている、眩いその時代に。誰も恨まず、死せることを憾まず、必ず其処で逢おう」 "That brightly shining era in which you’re smiling even now. Without hating anyone or regretting death, let’s meet there for sure."
** In ''[[Marana's Last Struggle]]'', the [[Traveler]] is asked to put off seven "wicked flame", likely referencing the album being Sound Horizon's 7th Story album.
