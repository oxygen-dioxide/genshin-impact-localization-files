'''Barnabas''',<ref group="Note">Throughout the Manga, the Sumeru Fatuus is never directly referred to by name. Chapter 13's official description calls him a "mysterious foe from [Collei's] past," while his appearance is identical to Collei's memories of the person who performed the archon residue experiments on her. During "[[Serpent's Dance]]," the voice in Collei's head tells her ''"So what if [this sickening power] is from Barnabas?"'' Based on this, the wiki assumes his name is Barnabas for the convenience of description.</ref> is a [[Manga]]-only character. A [[Fatuus]] from [[Sumeru]], Barnabas pursues his former experimentation subject [[Collei]] to [[Mondstadt]] upon discovering that she may still be alive.

==Profile==
Barnabas appears to have been a respected seer in Sumeru, which led Collei's parents to bring her to him in hopes of saving her from her chronic illness. Unbeknownst to them, he was in league with the Fatui and, rather than taking her in to cure her of the "[touch of] the deev," he took her in so he could use her as a test subject for the effects of directly injecting [[god|archon]] residue into a human being.<ref group="Note">The original Chinese name for archon residue is {{lang|mini=1|zh=魔神残渣|zh_rm=demon god residue,}} referring to gods who predate the rise of the [[The Seven|Seven Archons]], and can be likened to [[Tatarigami]] and [[karma]].</ref>

In the present, Barnabas is a subordinate to the Fatui [[Harbinger]] [[Il Dottore]]. After Dottore expresses his disinterest in handling the Black Fire Incident, Barnabas takes responsibility for it and promises to bring back something interesting. However, due to [[Kaeya]] and [[Diluc]]'s plan as well as unexpected resistance from [[Amber]] and Collei, Barnabas is instead left severely wounded and humiliated upon his return to the vexed Harbinger.

===Appearance===
Barnabas has dark, grey-brown skin, yellow cat-like eyes, white hair, and a white mustache and goatee. He wears a patterned purple and orange scarf around his neck and shoulders, a white vest with gold accents unbuttoned to expose his bare chest. An eye symbol is tattooed onto the side of his left shoulder. Most of his arms are wrapped in bandages.

==Story==
When Collei was a baby, her parents left her with Barnabas in hopes that he could cure her of her affliction.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|3}}</ref> Instead, he used her for human experiments and ordered his men to "get rid" of Collei's mother when she attempted to visit her daughter.<ref name="Ch15">{{Ref/Manga|15}}</ref> Collei was left deeply embittered by these painful experiments, the innate destructiveness she embodied after becoming a successful test subject, and the rejection she faced in Sumeru for being "unclean." In her quest for vengeance, she traveled from Sumeru to the [[City of Mondstadt]] in hopes that the [[Mondstadt Library]] would have information on him.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|4}}</ref>

Collei arrived at Mondstadt right as a Fatui diplomatic convoy was about to depart on Dottore's whims. When the guards at the gate proved hesitant to let her in on account of her disease, Collei used her archon residue powers to target the convoy, killing the two diplomats inside the carriage. In the ensuing panic, Collei slipped into the city. The [[Knights of Favonius]] dubbed this event the "Black Fire Incident" and began investigating the matter, eventually finding a document which revealed that Collei's power was connected to an incident from three years prior involving [[Crepus|Crepus Ragnvindr]] and a [[Delusion]],<ref>{{Ref/Manga|6|2}}</ref><ref name="Ch8-2">{{Ref/Manga|8|2}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Manga|10|pg=18}}</ref><ref group="Note">Observing the way Jean holds the burnt document in Chapter 6 (Part 2), pages 2&ndash;3 reveals that it is a single, folded document which details both Crepus' Delusion and the syringe used to inject Collei with archon residue, which is seen in a flashback in Chapter 10 (Part 1), page 18.</ref> although Barnabas' role in that incident is unclear. After learning the document might contain information on how to treat Collei's affliction by sealing the archon residue, [[Lisa]] sent word to [[Sumeru Akademiya]] to request [[Cyno]]'s assistance.<ref name="Ch8-2" /><ref>{{Ref/Manga|11|2}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the Knights of Favonius' report about the Black Fire Incident reached Dottore and Barnabas. Intrigued by the description of the event, and given free reign over the situation by Dottore, Barnabas vowed to bring back "something worthy of [his] interest."<ref>{{Ref/Manga|9}}</ref> He arrived during [[Ludi Harpastum]] and witnessed [[Kaeya]]'s clash with Collei, as well as Amber's intervention. The next day, he brought up the incident, framing Amber as a traitor working with the murderer. Kaeya feigned cooperation but had already concocted a plan with Diluc to trick the Fatui: Diluc would distract Barnabas and his men by wielding Crepus' Delusion, which gave off a nearly identical effect as Collei's archon residue due to their shared origin, and posing as the perpetrator of the crime. While they were able to trick Barnabas' bodyguards, Barnabas sensed the power of Collei's archon residue as Cyno sealed it away and left on his own to hunt her down.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|13}}</ref>

Intrigued that someone managed to survive being injected with archon residue, he harangued Collei in a bid to convince her to reawaken the freshly sealed archon residue, which would take her over if activated again. Amber attacked him to avoid letting Collei lose control again, disarming him and pinning him down with her arrows before he unleashed a god's power through a seal on his neck, which transformed him into a giant lion-like beast with horns and fangs.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|14}}</ref>

Despite facing incredible odds against Barnabas' new form, Amber refused to give up. Collei's desire to gain the power to protect those she cares about caused a temporary change in Amber's [[Vision]], and the two stood against Barnabas together. At a critical moment, Diluc used his Delusion to pin down Barnabas, giving Amber an opportunity to land a critical blow. His power spent, Barnabas returned to his human form and collapsed the ground. Upon seeing Diluc, Barnabas uttered his surprise at seeing the Delusion in the redhead's hands before falling unconscious. At that moment, Kaeya and Barnabas' guards arrived on the scene and arrested Diluc, thus "capturing" the culprit of the Black Fire Incident and drawing the situation to a close.<ref name="Ch15" />

Barnabas is last seen before Dottore, who is less than pleased by the results he had obtained. Dottore tells his men to "dispose of this garbage," with the heavily wounded Barnabas unable to plead for mercy with his mouth bandaged up. Meanwhile, Diluc had escaped and destroyed the Delusion in the process, leaving Dottore's men with nothing to show for their last four years of work.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|16}}</ref>
