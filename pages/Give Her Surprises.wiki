==Optional Quest Dialogue==
The following optional dialogues become available in the open-world as soon as this quest appears in the quest log, and will remain available until the end of this quest, with these additional conditions:
* Arachitta and Arasati disappear when talked to, so their dialogue is only available once.
* Layla's dialogue below gets replaced by her new open-world dialogue from the next quest, ''[[Give Her Sweetness]]'', once this quest ends and that quest becomes available in the quest log.
* Nilou, Najia, and the Wanderer disappear after the time changes to trigger Paimon's voice-lines of the next quest.

===Layla===
;(Talk to [[Layla]] outside [[Puspa Café]])
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq001 layla 01.ogg}} -->'''Layla:''' So, she wants to summarize the effects of stars interacting with each other... That's going to be tricky.
:{{DIcon}} Happy [[Sabzeruz Festival]], "other Layla."
:{{DIcon}} Happy Sabzeruz Festival, "Blessing from the stars."
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq001 layla 02.ogg}} -->'''Layla:''' Ah, you noticed... As you can see, daylight Layla is currently too stressed to enjoy the festivities.
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq001 layla 03.ogg}} -->'''Layla:''' With a deadline coinciding with the festival, and a research topic concerning complex astrology... It's no surprise she's been sleepwalking again.
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything I can do to help?
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq001 layla 04.ogg}} -->'''Layla:''' Sorry. I'm not sure we can trust such complex and precise calculations to someone else. Just visit her more often, if you have the time. I think that would make her very happy.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Layla)

:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq001 nilou 01.ogg}} -->'''Nilou:''' Oh, um... I&mdash;I'd better not. It's almost Parade day, so I should restrain myself.
:{{A|vo dialog hseq001 negar 02.ogg}} '''Najia:''' Shame... I heard they're doing a buy one get one free promotion for their [[Padisarah Pudding]]!
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq001 nilou 02.ogg}} -->'''Nilou:''' Really?
:{{A|vo dialog hseq001 negar 03.ogg}} '''Najia:''' Oh, and their [[Tahchin|tahchin]] is buy one get one half off...

:{{DIcon}} You're here, aren't you?
::{{A|vo dialog hseq001 wanderer 02a 1.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' This is the only place where I can escape all the commotion.
:{{DIcon}} You're not going to join in on the fun?
::{{A|vo dialog hseq001 wanderer 02b 1.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Do I strike you as someone who wants to hold hands and dance with everyone?
:{{A|vo dialog hseq001 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Go have your fun, and don't tell anyone you saw me here.
:{{A|vo dialog hseq001 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' These festivals don't come by often, so you might as well let me enjoy it in my own way.

{{Quest Description|Sumeru is holding the Sabzeruz Festival! Upon hearing the news, you arrive to see some familiar faces...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}<!-- NOTE: Only partially voiced for EN. So far only Paimon lines have audio -->
;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo hseq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, it's almost time for the Sabzeruz Festival, right? It's always so lively!<ref group="Note">"It's always so lively!" is spoken at the beginning of the next line instead.</ref>
:{{A|vo hseq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wonder what the flower carriage is gonna look like this year? Let's go check it out!<ref group="Note">"It's always so lively!" from the previous line is spoken here instead.</ref>

;(Approach Candace, [[Collei]], [[Dehya]], and [[Tighnari]] in Port Ormos)
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Tighnari and Collei are over there! Oh, and Dehya and Candace are with them!
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go say hi!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 01.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' ...Everyone good with their assignment? Then let's get this show on the road.
:{{Introductory Note|Tighnari}}
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 02.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' Oh, and again, please be careful. The last thing we want is for her to find out about our plan.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 01.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' Don't worry about that! Mercenaries can keep a secret like our lives depend on it.
:{{Introductory Note|Dehya}}
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 candace 01.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' I'm not sure this scenario is quite that extreme.
:{{Introductory Note|Candace}}
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 02.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' You know what I mean, Candace. It's just a figure of speech.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 collei 01.ogg}} -->'''Collei:''' Um... I'm still kinda nervous. It's not that I'm scared I'll let something slip, it's just... what if she suddenly shows up behind me without warning...
:{{Introductory Note|Collei}}
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there! What are you guys talking about?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 collei 02.ogg}} -->'''Collei:''' Aaaaaah! Nothing, I swear! I don't know anything you don't know. I'm not hiding anything!
:{{DIcon}} You're definitely hiding something.
:{{DIcon}} Just tell us. The cat's already out of the bag.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 03.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' ...Calm down, Collei. At least check who it is before you freak out.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 03.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' {{Traveler}}! Paimon! Fancy seeing you here.
:{{DIcon}} Great to see you all!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 collei 03.ogg}} -->'''Collei:''' Oh, it's you two. Ah... You scared me half to death! Just like when I lose focus in class, and Master Tighnari suddenly shows up behind me, but even scarier!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 candace 02.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Are you here for the Sabzeruz Festival?
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! Festivals are always so fun. It seemed like the perfect time to come back and hang out with all of our friends!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 04.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' This one is extra special. I heard from [[Naphis|Master]] that the Akademiya is planning a grand birthday celebration for the Dendro Archon.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 05.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' Perhaps it's a small attempt to make amends for their past behavior.
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, guess we came at the perfect time! A grand celebration calls for even more good food and fun than usual!
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, what were you gossiping about just now? Paimon heard something about a secret?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 06.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' Over here, you two. I'll explain everything in private.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 07.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' We're preparing a birthday surprise for the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oooh! A Birthday Surprise!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 candace 03.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' It was Dehya's idea, actually.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 04.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' Oh, well... It was just something that occurred to me while talking with [[Dunyarzad]]. The Sabzeruz Festival always seems to follow the same formula, so I figured a change of pace might be nice.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 05.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' Dunyarzad liked the idea, and so did the others. So, we got the ball rolling pretty quickly.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 08.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' If we want this to be a surprise, the fewer people who know, the better. We're dealing with the God of Wisdom here &mdash; a single slip of the tongue is enough to spoil the whole thing.
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that all makes sense! So, um... do we have to keep talking like this until the festival ends?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 collei 04.ogg}} -->'''Collei:''' Pfft...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 09.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' Ahem! So, anyway, we've only asked a few of our friends to help out, since they happened to have some free time.
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what exactly are you planning?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 collei 05.ogg}} -->'''Collei:''' Well, we heard the Dendro Archon loves candy, so we want to take advantage of that.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 06.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' We're also planning a birthday meal after the Carriage Parade! So, we'll have a Haft-Mewa Feast as well.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 tighnari 10.ogg}} -->'''Tighnari:''' We left most of the specifics to [[Kaveh]]. Right now, all we need to do is purchase the food and decorations.
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything we can do to help?
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, put us to work! Now that we're in on the plan, we should do something to contribute!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 07.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' Hey, Candace, weren't you looking for someone to help you with the shopping?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 candace 04.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Yeah. I've been in the desert so long, I was worried I wouldn't be the best judge of the goods around here.
:{{DIcon}} We can help with that.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 candace 05.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' As long as it's not too much trouble...
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No trouble at all! We're more than happy to help!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 08.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' Hey, seems like you're really learning your manners, Paimon.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 candace 06.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' I'll happily take you up on that offer, then.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 dehya 09.ogg}} -->'''Dehya:''' Alright, it's settled! Tighnari will book the venue, Dunyarzad and I will take care of decorations, and you three are on food.
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, so exciting! This is gonna be the best birthday surprise Nahida could ask fo&mdash;
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 2 together 01.ogg}} -->'''Crowd:''' Shhh...!
:{{A|vo hseq001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! Paimon almost forgot... Gotta keep it a secret...

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, there's all kinds of delicious scents in the air today! The sea breeze in Port Ormos isn't even enough to cover them up!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 01.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' This is the final stop of the Carriage Parade, so many of the vendors decided to set up their stalls in advance. The city is a lot more lively than usual.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 02.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' The same goes for Aaru Village. Everyone's doing their part to make this a truly unforgettable Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, well, with all these vendors, there's no way we're going back empty-handed! Just leave the haggling to us.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 03.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Alright, then, let's... Ugh! Ah...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:{{DIcon}} Are you okay?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 04.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' I'm fine...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 05.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' ...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 06.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Sorry for making you worry. Let's go to that store and place an order.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 01.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Welcome! What can I get for you today?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 07.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' We'd like to place an order for the Sabzeruz Festival. Could you have them ready for pickup after the parade?
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 02.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' No problem at all. What'll it be?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 08.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' We'll take three orders each of [[Masala Cheese Balls]], [[Potato Boat]]s, and [[Curry Shrimp]], and ten orders of [[Panipuri]].
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 03.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' One sec, let me jot this down... Potato Boats... Panipuri... Alright, we'll have that ready as scheduled. That's a fairly sizeable order!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 09.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Does that mean we can expect a discount?
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 04.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Of course! Let me see... That should come to twenty-nine thousand Mora, but you can have it for twenty-six thousand. How's that sound?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 10.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' What about twenty thousand?
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh...?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Wow... She really went for it.)
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 05.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Uhh... That's a bit tricky. We're going to be fairly busy that day, and we're setting aside all these ingredients for your order...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 11.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' What if I add five orders of [[Samosa]]s? Would that help lower the price?
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 06.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Well, in that case... the most I can offer is twenty percent off.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 12.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Great, we'll take it. Thank you so much.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 07.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Of course! Of course! Thank you for your order.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, it turns out Candace is way better at haggling than us...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 13.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Oh, one more thing...
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 08.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Something you wanted to add to your order, Miss?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 14.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' No. I just wanted to remind you to keep an eye on the fire you've got going there. If you let it burn too long, it could become a safety hazard.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 09.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Oh, thanks for your concern. But, I replaced the charcoal earlier today, so it should be&mdash;
:'''Extremely Loud Noise:''' BANG!!!
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! *cough* There's... so much smoke!
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 10.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Ugh... *cough*...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 15.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Are you alright?
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 11.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' I'm fine, thanks. It's just... That was so strange...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 16.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Was it the Wind Generator?
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 12.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' *cough*... It's certainly possible. I had a similar problem not too long ago. I thought switching to this one would fix the issue, but...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 17.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' We can look into the true cause of the problem a bit later. What matters now is that you're alright. Need any water? I've got some on me.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 13.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' I'm alright! Seems like you've got a good eye, Miss. Just wish your warning came a little earlier. Probably could've avoided this scenario entirely.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 14.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' In any case, I'll definitely fix the stove today, so don't worry about any delays.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 18.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Take your time &mdash; your health and safety are more important. I'll just leave the deposit here.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 jahangir 15.ogg}} '''Jahangir:''' Sounds good. See you soon!
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was a close call! Good thing you're fast on your feet, Candace!
:{{DIcon}} How did you know something was wrong with the stove?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 19.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Hmm... I guess you could call it... a gut feeling? It's hard to describe.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, where should we go next? Preferably somewhere without any fire hazards. Paimon's still a little traumatized by what happened.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 3 candace 20.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Let's go buy some fruit. We need it to make the candy.
:{{A|vo hseq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds good! It's been a while since we had the chance to shop at Port Ormos. Maybe we can pick up some other things along the way.

;(Continue along the path)
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see... The fruit stand should be that way...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 01.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Ugh...!
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Candace? Are you okay?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 02.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' ...! Watch out!
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 hatice 01.ogg}} '''Hatice:''' ...Huh?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 03.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Are you okay, little one?
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 hatice 02.ogg}} '''Hatice:''' I... I'm fine! Thank you, Miss!
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 01.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' What happened?
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That crate came out of nowhere! Luckily, Candace saved that little girl before she got hit.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 02.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' Where are your parents, child?
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 hatice 03.ogg}} '''Hatice:''' Th&mdash;They're at the tavern by the harbor, but I got bored, so I came out to play...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 04.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' You're safe now, little one. Just be careful next time.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 03.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' ...Go back to your parents now, child.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 hatice 04.ogg}} '''Hatice:''' O&mdash;Okay...
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 04.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' Whose crates are these?
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 kutbi 01.ogg}} '''Kutbi:''' Th&mdash;They're mine...
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 05.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' How many times have I told you not to leave heavy objects by the road! When are you going to learn?
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 kutbi 02.ogg}} '''Kutbi:''' I&mdash;I'm sorry! I&mdash;It's just... we ran out of storage for our latest shipment...
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 06.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' And!?
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 kutbi 03.ogg}} '''Kutbi:''' ...N&mdash;Nothing! I'll take care of it right away! I won't do it again!
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 07.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 08.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' Thank you, everyone. I should've been keeping a closer eye on everything. Lucky you were here, Miss Candace. I really don't know how things would've turned out, otherwise.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 05.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' It was nothing. Don't blame yourself, Sheriff. I understand just how difficult it is to look after a whole region. Still, with the festival coming, we need your vigilance more than ever.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 09.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' *sigh* Always feels like I could use an extra pair of eyes during Sabzeruz season. I appreciate the reminder, Miss Candace.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 shyam 10.ogg}} '''Shyam:''' Anyway, you were probably in the middle of something, so I'll leave you to it. Enjoy the festival!
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was some quick thinking, Candace! It was like you leapt into action before the crate even started to fall.
:{{DIcon}} Like you knew what was gonna happen all along...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 06.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' ...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 07.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Actually, I... I did see something. I saw the crate fall before it happened.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you mean... You saw the future!?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 08.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Yes... something similar happened with the stove. I saw what was about to happen...
:{{DIcon}} The Eye of Prophecy...
:{{DIcon}} It's actually... real?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 09.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' I don't think it's related to my amber eye. Growing up, it's never shown me any kind of strange phenomena...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 10.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' But, ever since this morning, I've been seeing things that don't match with reality, and after a few seconds, they actually come to pass...
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you told anyone else about this?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 11.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Not yet... I still haven't determined if this is the true power of prophecy, and I don't want to make everyone worry.
:{{DIcon}} But, why did it come on so suddenly?
:{{DIcon}} Did something happen this morning?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 12.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Nothing out of the ordinary, really. I prayed to the gods, made my plan for the day, then went to meet my friends.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 13.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Although, if I had to think of something... I did buy this gem along the way.
:[[File:Give Her Surprises Gemstone.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, it's beautiful!
:{{DIcon}} There's something about it...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 14.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' So you sense it, too? This gem seems to contain traces of unusual [[elemental]] energy. I only bought it because it piqued my interest.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could the gem be the source of the visions?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 15.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' It's certainly possible. Here, try it for yourself. Maybe you'll see something as well...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...)
:{{DIcon}} I don't think anything happened.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 16.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Hmm... So, it doesn't work for just anyone.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 17.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Perhaps there's some kind of trigger condition... Or could it be because of my connection to Lord [[Al-Ahmar]]?
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe we could ask the others?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 18.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Everyone's been so busy preparing for the festival. I really don't want to trouble them with something so trivial.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 19.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Luckily, I don't have too many responsibilities over the next few days, so I can investigate on my own. It's part of my duty as a "guardian."
:{{DIcon}} We can help too.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 20.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Even better! Having your company is like sitting around a bonfire with trusted companions &mdash; your presence puts people at ease.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 21.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Alright, let's finish our shopping first, then we can investigate the gem. At the very least, we should ask around the merchant circles for information on its origins.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of merchants... Paimon can think of someone who's always in the know. Although getting information out of her is definitely gonna cost us...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 4 candace 22.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Ah, do you mean Dori? I've heard people talk about her in [[Aaru Village]] before.
:{{A|vo hseq001 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, that's the one! But, uh, she's pretty touchy when it comes to Mora, so it's best not to haggle too much...
:{{Black Screen|You purchase the fruits on the shopping list...}}
:{{Black Screen|The vendors tell you where to find Dori.}}

;(Approach Dori)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 01.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' ...Here are the goods you asked for, as promised. All of the best quality, I assure you, hehe. Can I interest you in any of my newest offerings before you go?
:{{Introductory Note|Dori}}
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 02.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' No? Well, see you around, then.
:{{A|vo hseq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dori!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 03.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' Ohoho! If it isn't two of my most valued customers! And... Miss Candace? Now, this is getting interesting...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 04.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' What brings the guardian of Aaru village to my neck of the woods? All my business in the desert is strictly above board, I assure you!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 01.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' You misunderstand, Miss Dori. We're just here for some information.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 05.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' Ooh! You're in the market for some intel! Well, you've come to the right place! I love dealing in information. It's easy to carry, and even easier to hike up the price! Oh, um... which is always very reasonable of course!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 02.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' I bought a rather peculiar gem this morning, and I have the name of the merchant who sold it to me.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 03.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' I want to ask the merchant about the craftsman who cut this gem, and where they got their ore.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 06.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' Ah, so you're looking to track them down? Not an easy job. It'll come at {{sic}} hefty price.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 04.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Well, we don't necessarily have to track down that specific person. If you have a way of obtaining the information I seek, Miss Dori, I would be happy to compensate you for those services as well.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 07.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' (I can find the person no problem, but it's not as lucrative... I have a few connections who work with gemstones, so I'm better off charging them for the information directly.)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 08.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' Well, now you're just asking the impossible! These kinds of things tend to be trade secrets. It won't be easy to get that information, even for the great Lord Sangemah Bay.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 05.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Just name your price.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 09.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' Heh, if you insist! Now, let me see... there's the cost of travel, the gifts I'll have to buy...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 10.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' I'm thinking... around two hundred thousand Mora?
:{{A|vo hseq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes, that's steep!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 06.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' That exceeds our budget, I'm afraid. Can you go any lower?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 11.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' ...Well, Aaru Village has done me a few favors in the past, so I think we can strike a deal. Why don't you make me an offer.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 07.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' How about... fifty thousand Mora?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 12.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' Excuse me!?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (That's even more aggressive than back at the market...)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 08.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Something wrong? That's usually the going rate for this kind of intel in the desert.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 13.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' Impossible! I wouldn't even be able to put food on the table at that rate! Can't do it, nope!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 09.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Ah, what a shame... How about thirty thousand Mora, then?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 14.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' That's... That's even lower!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 10.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Thirty thousand Mora, plus food, shelter, and a security detail whenever you're in Aaru Village. I'll throw in a few tax exemptions as well. How does that sound?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 15.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' I&mdash;
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 16.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' (Aaru Village certainly has some promising business opportunities... Securing the protection of the local guardian isn't actually a bad trade...)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 17.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' (Tch... I'm not the only one profiting from this deal, though. I bet she only made that offer so Aaru Village could benefit from more business activity, too... What a scary woman.)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 18.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' Uh... Hehe... Alright! After some reflection, I've decided to forgo all profit for this venture! T&mdash;Thirty thousand it is!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 11.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Ah, now I know why people call you the number one merchant in Sumeru! Your generosity is truly unmatched!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 19.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' O&mdash;Of course! You're an esteemed client, Miss Candace! I stand more to gain from your friendship than anything else. So, who cares about the Mora!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 12.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' If that's the case, then&mdash;
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 20.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' And by that, I mean... we landed on the perfect price! Thirty thousand, as agreed!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 21.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' (*sigh*... Just gonna have to treat my gem contact to a 500 Mora food stall instead.)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 22.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' I really have to go out of my way to get this intel, so I'll need some time. Why don't you... come back tomorrow!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 13.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Of course. Thank you, Miss Dori. You've been a huge help.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 14.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' {{Traveler}}, you've only just made it back to Sumeru. Why don't you take some time for yourself? I'll handle the rest of the orders.
:{{A|vo hseq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Paimon feels kinda bad, though. We didn't turn out to be much help.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 15.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Don't say that. I dragged you into my own personal investigation. I should be the one apologizing.
:{{DIcon}} It was nothing &mdash; don't worry about it.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 16.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' Haha, noble as always. May the gods protect you, {{Traveler}}.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 candace 17.ogg}} -->'''Candace:''' And you, Miss Dori. Safe travels. I'll see you tomorrow.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 5 dori 23.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' *sigh*... Yep. Take care...

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Dori, optional)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq001 6 dori 01.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' (A profit of only twenty thousand Mora? Hmph, maybe I'll skip the schmoozing altogether.)

;(Talk to Dori again, optional)
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq001 dori 01.ogg}} -->'''Dori:''' This commission is tricky, and I'm practically losing Mora. Just remember that I'm doing you a huge favor here!
