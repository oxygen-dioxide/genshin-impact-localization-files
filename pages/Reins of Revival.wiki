The '''Reins of Revival''', originally known as '''Reins of Recovery''', is first introduced in [[The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent]]. It is made from the same materials as [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] and is used to display control over the spirits in [[Evernight]]. Restoring the Reins of Revival allows the Traveler to activate it and descend to the base of Dainichi Mikoshi.

The Reins of Revival comprise the [[Golden Bridle]] and the following fragments:
* [[Reins of Revival Fragment (Serpent's Heart)]]
* [[Reins of Revival Fragment (Temple)]]
* [[Reins of Revival Fragment (The Narrows)]]
