{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Aragita)
:'''Aragita:''' It's Aranara's friend! Good Nara, want to play with Aragita?
:{{DIcon}} Sure. What are we playing?
::'''Aragita:''' Under the wooden chests there are not only lizards but also other things. Nara shall remember the position of the {{color|buzzword|pile of leaves}}<!-- typo (extra space) --> .
::{{DIcon}} That's trivial. Let's get started.
::;(Starts countdown)
:{{DIcon}} The timing isn't right.
::'''Aragita:''' Aragita won't rush. Will wait for the "right timing."

;(If the player destroys a pile of leaves during the countdown)
:'''Aragita:''' Wait! No, no, no! Don't you know how to play this game, Nara? ... Did Aragita not explain properly? Ugh, you've ruined Aragita's preparations...
:'''Aragita:''' Bad Nara! Aragita will remember this!

;(After the countdown ends)
:'''Aragita:''' {{color|buzzword|A huge pile of leaves}}. Does Nara know where it is?

;(If the player destroys the wrong crate)
:'''Aragita:''' Nara got it wrong, but it doesn't matter. There is a lot of "next time." Any time playing with Nara is "the right time" for Aragita.

;(If the player successfully completes the challenge)
:'''Aragita:''' Hehe, Aragita's happy. This is for Nara. Come back and hang out with Aragita in the future!
:;(A [[Common Chest]] appears)

;(Talk to Aragita after completing the challenge)
:'''Aragita:''' Grass and trees remember, so does Nara. Nara is Aranara's friend, and the friend of grass and trees, too.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Ardravi Valley===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Aragita)
:'''Aragita:''' It's been a long wait for Aragita and the Golden Nara is finally here. Don't let this chance slip away. Let's play?
:{{DIcon}} Sure. What are we playing?
::'''Aragita:''' Aragita hid all kinds of paintings under the wooden chests to see if Nara has the ability of "never forget." Remember {{color|buzzword|the painting with the most strokes}}?
::{{DIcon}} Okay, let's do this.
::;(Starts countdown)
:{{DIcon}} Not the right timing.
::'''Aragita:''' Aragita won't rush. Will wait for the "right timing."

;(After the countdown ends)
:'''Aragita:''' {{color|buzzword|The one with the most strokes}}! Does Nara know where it is?

;(If the player destroys the wrong crate)
:'''Aragita:''' Nara got it wrong, but it doesn't matter. There is a lot of "next time." Any time playing with Nara is "the right time" for Aragita.

;(If the player successfully completes the challenge)
:'''Aragita:''' Hehe, Aragita's happy. This is for Nara. Come back and hang out with Aragita in the future!
:;(A [[Common Chest]] appears)

;(Talk to Aragita after completing the challenge)
:'''Aragita:''' Hmm... "Treasure Chest" seems nice? Should we borrow some "Treasure Chests" from its owner...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Vissudha Field===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Aragita)
:'''Aragita:''' Hehe, the wind in the forest told Aragita Nara's coming to play with Aragita.
:{{DIcon}} Sure. What are we playing?
::'''Aragita:''' A wooden chest can store a lot of things, like... shiny of various elements! Aragita remembers {{color|buzzword|where the Dendro shiny is}}. Can Nara also remember?
::{{DIcon}} No problem. Let's do this.
::;(Starts countdown)
:{{DIcon}} Not the right timing.
::'''Aragita:''' Aragita won't rush. Will wait for the "right timing."

;(After the countdown ends)
:'''Aragita:''' Does Nara know where the {{color|buzzword|Dendro Shiny}} is hidden?

;(If the player collect elemental particles before the wooden crate appear)
:'''Aragita:''' Ah! Greedy Nara! Don't think you can forget about the shinies just because you ate them! You may have eaten them, but Aragita remembers!

;(If the player destroys the wrong crate)

;(If the player successfully completes the challenge)
