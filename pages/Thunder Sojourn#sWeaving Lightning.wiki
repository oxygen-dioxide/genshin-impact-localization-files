|The Weaving Lightning has a unique mechanic known as the [[Nimbus Gem]] that will release electric pulses to link up with characters who are {{Color|help|carrying Electrograna}} or {{Color|help|affected by Electro}}. Characters will gain various buffs depending on the number of Nimbus Gems they are linked to.

|1 Linked Nimbus Gem: The active character continually recharges Energy, the rate of regeneration increasing with more links. 2 Linked Nimbus Gems: Other than the aforementioned effect, all characters in the party deal increased DMG with their Elemental Bursts. 3 Linked Nimbus Gems: Hitting opponents with Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts will unleash a shockwave at that opponent's location. Shockwaves created in this manner have a CD.
