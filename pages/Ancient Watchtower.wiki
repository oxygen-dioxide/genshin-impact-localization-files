|description  =  Legend has it that in ancient times, the [[Dragon|colossal beasts]] that roamed the land had a civilization of their own. After exploring the entirety of the land and surrounding sea, they built these structures in an attempt to cast their gaze upon the even [[Abyss|wider world beyond]]. But these wise beasts have long since vanished, and in the present, no one now knows the true purpose of this place.

{{Description|The great dragon erected many peculiar structures across the land. In the ancient legends, the great dragon's outstretched wings could together blot out the light of the sky. Perhaps such descriptions were not hyperbole, or perhaps such wording was a metaphor for their desire to see [[Abyss|beyond the sky]].<br>But now, the traces of said ancient dragon have already vanished, and the people of today can only but glimpse the forging techniques of that ancient civilization through the shattered remnants of those massive structures and their patterns.}}
