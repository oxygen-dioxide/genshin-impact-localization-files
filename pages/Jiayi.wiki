==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jiayi:''' Ah, traveler! It's you.
:'''Jiayi:''' You have to see this picture of my daughter, she looks so adorable...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Jiayi:''' "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail." We are the Millelith &mdash; Protectors of Liyue.
::'''Jiayi:''' I'm a soldier, proud to be serving with the Millelith in defense of this great city of Liyue Harbor.
::'''Jiayi:''' ...I say that. But I'd still rather be working closer to [[Qingce Village]].
::'''Jiayi:''' That's where my beloved daughter is. I think about her constantly...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your daughter.
::'''Jiayi:''' Her name's [[Little Liu]]. My wife sadly passed away in childbirth, so it's the grandparents who look after her now.
::'''Jiayi:''' She's still very young. I haven't a clue how to explain this to her... So I just lie, and say that her mother has always been working in Liyue Harbor...
::'''Jiayi:''' *sigh* I haven't seen her in a good long while since coming to Liyue on my own for work. The last time I held her in my arms, she was nowhere close to the weight of this polearm...
::'''Jiayi:''' Is she eating her dinner?
::'''Jiayi:''' Is she in good health?
::'''Jiayi:''' Is she making lots of nice friends?
::'''Jiayi:''' *sigh* Liu... Your daddy misses you so much...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Jiayi:''' Bye, traveler.
::'''Jiayi:''' Do me a favor if you ever pass through Qingce Village, would you? Ask for Little Liu and tell her that her daddy's doing just fine, and that he'll come to visit as soon as he can... and that's a promise...

:'''Jiayi:''' While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
:'''Jiayi:''' Have you released a Xiao Lantern yet? If you write a wish on the lantern, it's bound to come true someday.
:'''Jiayi:''' For example, my wish was that my daughter [[Little Liu]] would live a peaceful and healthy life, and that she'd make many friends, haha.
:'''Jiayi:''' ...Perhaps you'll even be able to see the sky filled with Xiao Lanterns from atop the hills of Qingce Village.
:'''Jiayi:''' *sigh* Little Liu... Your daddy misses you so much...
