!Enemy
!Description and Skill(s)
|-id="Machine Marionette: Heart of the Blade
|{{Card|Maguu Kenki|type=Enemy|danger=1|caption=Machine Marionette: Heart of the Blade}}
|Souka designed this opposing piece based on the mighty Maguu Kenki.<br>Souka feared pursuit by the powerful entity or criticism by strong adventurers who had crossed swords with it if she were to directly use its name. As such, its name, techniques, and her depiction of it in her writings all have some differences from the real thing. Of course, this hasn't stopped her from viewing it as a distant goal toward which she hones her martial skills...<br>The Machine Marionette: Heart of the Blade specializes in using different AoE attacks to deal deadly DMG to opponents. Seize the moment and avoid it in time!
|-id="Frigid Fang: Avalanche"
|{{Card|Great Snowboar King|type=Enemy|danger=1|caption=Frigid Fang: Avalanche}}
|An opposing piece designed by Souka based on the legendary Great Snowboar King. Souka would really like to tour Dragonspine and see its snow-white sights for herself, but being afraid of the cold as she is, she has steered clear of the place. As such, her inspiration for this design is derived from Adventurers' Guild rumors as well as various texts...<br>Frigid Fang: Avalanche can summon small Snowboars to engage in coordinated attacks. Use the shields you will obtain from defeating these smaller Snowboars to counter the King's charge and stun it in order to achieve victory faster.

;Snowboar Support
[[File:Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta Skill Snowboar Support.png|250px]]<br>
Summons a Lil' Snowboar to perform a coordinated attack against the Lil' Fungi. When a Lil' Snowboar is defeated, it will drop a Frosty Blessing. Lil' Fungi can pick up a Frosty Blessing to obtain a shield that protects them and nearby Lil' Fungi.

;Chilling Charge
[[File:Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta Skill Chilling Charge.png|250px]]<br>
Locks onto a Lil' Fungus and launches a continuous charge in that direction. After hitting the Lil' Fungi protected by a shield, "Frigid Fang: Avalanche" will be temporarily stunned.
|-id="Shadowhat: Blade Ninken"
|{{Card|Kageroumaru|quality=0|danger=1|caption=Shadowhat: Blade Ninken|link=<!--enemy page perhaps?-->}}
|An opposing piece designed by Souka. Its design is based on the legendary Ninken of Inazuma.<br>Souka once had a great meal while listening in on intel concerning the Ninken at Komore Teahouse, but forgot to pay, and was thus taken for a spy by the boss, Taroumaru... This got so bad that Haniyyah, when invited to the teahouse, had to specially bring Taroumaru a gift as an apology. It was eventually thanks to Ryuuji from the Bantan Sango Detective Agency that the design was completed. This cemented Souka's respect for Ninken &mdash; hence, the immense power of the creature, worthy of a final challenge!<br>Bait Shadowhat: Blade Ninken into using its Plunging Attack to hit its own summoned Kawarimi Ninken to stun it temporarily and gain the advantage in the challenge.

;Ninjutsu{{Colon}} Woof-Woof Transformation
[[File:Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta Skill Ninjutsu Woof-Woof Transformation.png|250px]]<br>
Summons a Kawarimi Ninken on the field and after a period of time, the "Shadowhat: Blade Ninken" will swiftly move to the Kawarimi Ninken's position.

[[File:Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta Skill Ninjutsu Ruff-Ruff Leaping Slash.png|250px]]<br>
Leaps high and locks onto a Lil' Fungus. After a short interval, it unleashes a powerful Plunging Attack in this direction. If the attack hits a Kawarimi Ninken, the explosion will affect itself, causing "Shadowhat: Blade Ninken" to be temporarily stunned.
|-id="Lil' Ruin Guard"
|{{Card|Ruin Guard|type=Enemy|danger=1|caption=Lil' Ruin Guard}}
|An opposing piece based on the Ruin Guard.<br>Even Souka, who has little adventuring experience, has seen these machines many times, and has developed a certain curiosity concerning their construction. However, novels often have it that such mighty machines must be full of secrets, and those who seek such knowledge may be disposed of. Thus, it might not be wise to do so...<br>If Lil' Fungi hit the Lil' Ruin Guards' cores with their attacks, they can stun it.
|-id="Lil' Thunderhelm Lawachurl"
|{{Card|Ruin Drake: Earthguard|type=Enemy|danger=1|caption=Lil' Ruin Drake: Earthguard}}
|An opposing piece based on the Ruin Drake: Earthguard.<br>Even experienced hands like Haniyyah and her mercenary friends will flee in a hurry if they so much as catch sight of this thing from afar. But such powerful foes tend to have a magnetism all their own, which is why Souka found herself disguised as a bush, trying to get close enough to one specimen, upon which she observed it for a few days to gain the information she needed to make the piece...<br>If you do not quickly defeat this piece, it will raise its Elemental RES based on the main Element used to deal DMG to it, which can be troublesome...
|-id="Lil' Ruin Grader"
|{{Card|Ruin Grader|type=Enemy|danger=1|caption=Lil' Ruin Grader}}
|An opposing piece based on the Ruin Grader.<br>After that incident where her shoulders were nearly relieved of her head, Souka would never dare to approach one of those autonomous machines so boldly again. Haniyyah would spend a rather large sum to import a Fontainian telescope for her to observe the majestic Ruin Graders. This led to a bit of a stunned silence when they first landed in Fontaine and inquired as to the actual price of such an item. Guess that's what they mean when they say "comparing prices is important"...<br>The Lil' Ruin Grader has great combat power. It can be stunned by hitting the energy cores on its body.
|-id="Lil' Thunderhelm Lawachurl"
|{{Card|Thunderhelm Lawachurl|type=Enemy|danger=1|caption=Lil' Thunderhelm Lawachurl}}
|An opposing piece based on a Thunderhelm Lawachurl.<br>Souka once entered the territory of one such creature by mistake while playing Temari with Kid Kujirai, and was laid up in bed following a single flick of the being's finger, causing her to miss an all-important manuscript due date...<br>The Lil' Thunderhelm Lawachurl's flashy moves make it a huge threat to all opponents around it, dealing significant Electro DMG.
|-id="Lil' Large Pyro Slime"
|{{Card|Large Pyro Slime|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Large Pyro Slime}}
|An opposing piece based on the Large Pyro Slime.<br>Souka's description informs you that "round pieces are easy to paint but hard to process. Care also needs to be taken that the Fungi won't take it for a jelly and eat it."<br>The Lil' Large Pyro Slime will use Pyro attacks to deal DMG to opponents.
|-id="Lil' Pyro Hilichurl Shooter"
|{{Card|Pyro Hilichurl Shooter|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Pyro Hilichurl Shooter}}
|An opposing piece based on a Pyro Hilichurl Shooter.<br>Souka once had a backpack full of manuscripts destroyed by hilichurl fire arrows, so these opponents aren't very strong in-game...<br>The Lil' Pyro Hilichurl Shooter will damage opponents with burning arrows.
|-id="Lil' Electro Hilichurl Shooter"
|{{Card|Electro Hilichurl Shooter|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Electro Hilichurl Shooter}}
|An opposing piece based on an Electro Hilichurl Shooter.<br>Haniyyah was once forced to flee in a bad state after being shot by electrified arrows while playing with her Fungi buddies by the water. It is said that this gave Souka inspiration for the former's current fluffy hairstyle...<br>The Lil' Electro Hilichurl Shooter will deal Electro damage using its arrows.
|-id="Lil' Hilichurl Grenadier"
|{{Card|Hilichurl Grenadier|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Hilichurl Grenadier}}
|An opposing piece based on the Hilichurl Grenadier.<br>Though Bongo-Head once used its head to reflect a grenade hurled by a hilichurl, thus executing a polite "return to sender"... That was pure coincidence, and if such mechanics were implemented into the game, the Lil' Hilichurl Grenadier may as well not be in it.<br>The Lil' Hilichurl Grenadier will throw Pyro Slimes to deal AoE explosive DMG.
|-id="Lil' Dendro Samachurl"
|{{Card|Dendro Samachurl|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Dendro Samachurl}}
|An opposing piece based on a Dendro Samachurl.<br>Kindlejoy went missing one day by accident, and by the time Haniyyah and Souka found it, it was happily chasing a Dendro Samuchurl around, dancing around the burning vines...<br>The Lil' Dendro Samachurl can summon vines to block its opponents' movements and also deal DMG.
|-id="Lil' Anemo Samachurl"
|{{Card|Anemo Samachurl|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Anemo Samachurl}}
|An opposing piece based on an Anemo Samachurl.<br>Souka previously taught Haniyyah how to make Lil' Fungi pieces, but the Anemo Samachurl's staff was so intricate that Haniyyah could not handle the precise work it required, eventually taking up painting duties for Slimes and Tainted Hydro Phantasms.<br>The Lil' Anemo Samachurl can summon wind currents that restrict opposing movement and create opportunities for its side to attack.
|-id="Lil' Blazing Axe Mitachurl"
|{{Card|Blazing Axe Mitachurl|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Blazing Axe Mitachurl}}
|An opposing piece based on a Blazing Axe Mitachurl.<br>Haniyyah once brought Souka with her to observe said Mitachurls and their moves, and how to knock them down mid-jump &mdash; a technique that involves a jumping slash just like a Mitachurl's. Souka claimed that she'd figured it out, but Haniyyah has never let her try this in practice...<br>The Lil' Blazing Axe Mitachurl can deal significant Pyro DMG using its axe.
|-id="Lil' Crackling Axe Mitachurl"
|{{Card|Crackling Axe Mitachurl|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Crackling Axe Mitachurl}}
|An opposing piece based on a Crackling Axe Mitachurl.<br>After some discussion, Haniyyah decided that, if attacked by Blazing or Crackling Axe Mitachurls, they could have their Fungi buddies to take aim and loose an anti-air volley against the creatures to stop them!<br>The Lil' Crackling Axe Mitachurl can use its axe to deal significant Electro DMG.
|-id="Lil' Large Hydro Slime"
|{{Card|Large Hydro Slime|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Large Hydro Slime}}
|An opposing piece based on the Large Hydro Slime.<br>Once, when heading outdoors, Haniyyah forgot to bring her water pouch, leaving her terribly parched. The clever Blitzara, upon seeing this, left for a moment, only to return with a Large Hydro Slime on its head, happily helping to quench Haniyyah's thirst, and even chasing the bewildered latter back to camp, helping to change Souka's hairstyle in the process...<br>The Lil' Large Hydro Slime will use Hydro attacks to deal DMG to opponents.
|-id="Lil' Large Cryo Slime"
|{{Card|Large Cryo Slime|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Large Cryo Slime}}
|An opposing piece based on the Large Cryo Slime.<br>Twirly-Whirly often helps gather apples from trees, and has even learned to bait Large Cryo Slimes into jumping, using their outer spikes to knock said apples down.<br>The Lil' Large Cryo slimes will use Cryo attacks against the Lil' Fungi. If paired with Hydro-aligned pieces, it can cause significant disruption through freezing... It is itself defended by a Cryo shield. Its defenses might crumble in the face of Elemental Reactions...
|-id="Lil' Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm"
|{{Card|Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm}}
|An opposing piece based on the Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm.<br>After coming to Fontaine, Souka initially believed these creatures to not have an aggressive character, and tried to say hello, only to be blown back, axe and all. She fell into the water, and barely escaped after a desperate swim. Thus did she experience one of Fontaine's specialties... Well, in a manner of speaking!<br>The Lil' Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm can unleash attacks at close quarters, dealing Hydro DMG.
|-id="Lil' Tainted Water-Spouting Phantasm"
|{{Card|Tainted Water-Spouting Phantasm|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Tainted Water-Spouting Phantasm}}
|An opposing piece based on the Tainted Water-Spouting Phantasm.<br>Unlike Souka, Haniyyah had a Melusine around her for protection when touring Fontaine. As such, she did not get close to the Tainted Water-Spouting Phantasms. However, after some careful observation from a distance, she concluded that they were not unbeatable. Unfortunately, she could not simply ruin her expensive new clothes over a spur-of-the-moment fight, so...<br>The Lil' Tainted Water-Spouting Phantasm can engage in long-range combat, dealing Hydro DMG.
|-id="Lil' Ruin Scout"
|{{Card|Ruin Scout|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Ruin Scout}}
|An opposing piece based on the Ruin Scout.<br>This sort of piece is designed with a lot of straight lines and seems quite complex, but it is actually quite easy to make. You just need to make sure the parts go together correctly and put it all together. Even Haniyyah, who claims to be quite clumsy in such crafts, can make 30 in a day...<br>The Lil' Ruin Scout is an expert in executing different types of close-quarter maneuvers.
|-id="Lil' Ruin Cruiser"
|{{Card|Ruin Cruiser|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Ruin Cruiser}}
|An opposing piece based on the Ruin Cruiser.<br>Leveraging her experience observing the Ruin Drake: Earthguard, Souka hid inside a large paper box and looked at a Cruiser up close, trying to repeat her previous stunt. Unfortunately, while shrubs blown by the wind are quite common, boxes with legs are very much not. The Cruiser wound up giving her a free haircut, such that her hair is, even now, about 30 percent shorter than it used to be, though it might be hard for her friends to tell, seeing as how she tied it up in a ponytail...<br>The Lil' Ruin Cruiser can change into various forms and launch different attacks from afar.
|-id="Lil' Ruin Defender"
|{{Card|Ruin Defender|type=Enemy|caption=Lil' Ruin Defender}}
|An opposing piece based on the Ruin Defender.<br>In the later stages of the event design, Souka would need an opponent specializing in defense that would allow her to create more flexible lineups. This led her to choose the Ruin Defender. She was also curious as to what might happen if "one were to entice other monsters to attack the Defender's shield." Unfortunately, Haniyyah came to stop this pragmatic writer who was all too quick to forget her fear after growing her hair out.<br>The Lil' Ruin Defender can form its components into a shield and defend against any attack from the front.
