{{Location Intro|description=<p>Vanarana is the homeland and playground of the mysterious playful creatures known as Aranara.</p> }}

The Vanarana area contains a single subarea, the village of [[Vanarana (Subarea)|Vanarana]]. However, the south of the zone is not part of any subarea, and is not affected by the village's dream state.

==Trivia==
* Before sufficient progression in the quest ''[[The World of Aranara]]'':
** The [[Statue of The Seven]] is not shown on the map.
** The area surrounding the Statue of The Seven and the area north of it, including the cave with the [[Tree of Dreams]], is covered by terrain and cannot be accessed. When traveling north on the path that should pass the Statue of The Seven, the path abruptly ends at a cliff-face. (This cliff-face appears uncolored like normal terrain under [[Elemental Sight]].)
** Players can step into this area freely.
** There are no enemies or chests in the area unless a Random Event is triggered.{{verify}}
* As of [[Version 3.0]], the Vanarana [[area]] is the second smallest area in game.
