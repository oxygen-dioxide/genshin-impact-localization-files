'''Seamus Pegg''' is the Seneschal of the [[Church of Favonius]] and one of the leaders of [[Mondstadt]]. He is also known by the title '''Cardinal of Daybreak'''.<ref name="barbarastory4">{{Ref/CS|Barbara|4}}</ref> He is the father of [[Jean]] and [[Barbara]].<ref name="jeanstory5">{{Ref/CS|Jean|5}}</ref><ref name="barbarahangout">{{Ref/Quest|Sister Victoria's Vexation}}</ref>

He has only appeared in the [[Manga]], which is set prior to the game's events, and is mentioned a few times in the game. Currently, he is accompanying Grand Master [[Varka]]'s expedition.

==Profile==
Seamus Pegg was once an adventurer, famed throughout [[Teyvat]]. When he came to [[Mondstadt]], he started anew with the Church of Favonius and later rose to the position of Seneschal. He fell in love with [[Frederica Gunnhildr]] of the prestigious [[Gunnhildr Clan]]; they married and had two daughters, Jean and Barbara. The two eventually separated and Barbara stayed with him.<ref name="jeanstory5" /> Despite their separation, he still kept Frederica's set of clothes as the Alder Knight, [[Gunnhildr's Legacy]], around.<ref>{{Ref/Outfit|Gunnhildr's Legacy}}</ref>

His current duties and responsibilities have been entrusted and handed over to [[Cardinal Calvin]], as he departed for an expedition with Grand Master [[Varka]].<ref name="barbarahangout" /> The purpose of the expedition is unknown, but is "related to a dangerous secret from days long past."<ref name="Sounds">{{Ref/Quest|Sounds From Afar (Quest)}}</ref>

==Story==
===Manga===
Seamus first appears in Chapter 1, attending the [[Ludi Harpastum]] festivities at Diluc Manor. When [[Il Dottore]] and [[Krupp]] demand an audience with him, Seamus shows himself. The three of them, as well as [[Diluc]] and [[Kaeya]], head to the Dawn Winery's meeting room to talk about the [[Fatui]]'s desire to recruit people from Mondstadt.<ref name="manga">{{Ref/Manga|1}}</ref>

Although unwilling to give into the Fatui's demands, Seamus was unable to find a way to tip negotiations in Mondstadt's favor. While deliberating on their next move, however, Dottore lost interest in Mondstadt after finding another object of greater interest &mdash; Diluc's [[Delusion]] &mdash; and ordered his diplomats to withdraw. Seamus, after learning that Dottore had left first, gets drunk and excitedly tells Kaeya the news.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|2}}</ref>

===In-Game===
Because Varka's expedition, which Seamus is a member of, departed from Mondstadt before the start of the [[Archon Quests]], Seamus has not made a proper appearance in the story. When attempting to retrieve the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]], [[Gotelinde]] tells the [[Traveler]] that a signed document from the Seneschal is one of the items required to borrow the artifact, and has optional dialogue where she mentions that Seamus is away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Venti's Plan}}</ref>

During the event ''[[Of Ballads and Brews]]'', Varka sends a letter to the [[Knights of Favonius]] with a status update, reassuring that all members of the expedition are alive and accounted for.<ref name="Sounds" />

==Trivia==
* A {{w|seneschal}} is a senior position filled by a court appointment within a royal, ducal, or noble household during the Middle Ages and early Modern period &mdash; historically a steward or majordomo of a medieval great house.
* Seamus Pegg was originally named "Seamus" in the [[manga]] and "Seamus Pegg" in the Closed Beta Test versions of Jean and Barbara's character stories. For [[Version 1.0]], he was renamed to "Simon Page," but it was reverted to "Seamus Pegg" in [[Version 1.4]].
** In Korean, he was renamed accordingly from {{ko|시몬 페이지|rm=Simon Peiji}} to {{ko|시무스・페그|rm=Simuseu Pegeu}},<ref name="barbarastory4" /><ref name="jeanstory5" /> but this change was not reflected in Barbara's Hangout Event.<ref name="barbarahangout" />
** His name remains unchanged in Chinese ({{zh|西蒙・佩奇|rm=Xīméng Pèiqí}}), Japanese ({{ja|サイモン・ペッチ|rm=Saimon Pecchi}}), and French (Seamus Page).
** In Japanese, his name is inconsistently localized as {{ja|サイモン・ペイジ|rm=Saimon Peiji}} in Barbara's Hangout Event.<ref name="barbarahangout" /> It is unknown which one is correct.
