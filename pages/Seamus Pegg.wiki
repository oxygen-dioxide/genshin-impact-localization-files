==Story==
While Seamus' name is not directly mentioned in the Archon Quests, his position as Seneschal is. When attempting to retrieve the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]], [[Gotelinde]] tells the [[Traveler]] that a signed document from the Seneschal is one of the items required to borrow the artifact, and has optional dialogue where she mentions that Seamus is away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Venti's Plan}}</ref>

===Manga===
Seamus first appears in Chapter 1<ref name="manga">{{Ref/Manga|1}}</ref> of the manga, attending the [[Ludi Harpastum]] festivities at the [[Dawn Winery]]. When [[Il Dottore]] and [[Krupp]] demand an audience with him, Seamus shows himself. The three of them, as well as [[Diluc]] and [[Kaeya]], head to the Dawn Winery's meeting room to talk about the [[Fatui]]'s desire to recruit people from Mondstadt.

==Trivia==
* A {{w|seneschal}} is a senior position filled by a court appointment within a royal, ducal, or noble household during the Middle Ages and early Modern period &mdash; historically a steward or majordomo of a medieval great house.
* Seamus Pegg was originally named "Seamus" in the [[manga]] and "Seamus Pegg" in the Closed Beta Test versions of Jean and Barbara's character stories. For [[Version 1.0]], he was renamed to "Simon Page," but it was reverted to "Seamus Pegg" in [[Version 1.4]].
** In Korean, he was renamed accordingly from {{Lang|mini=1|ko=시몬 페이지|ko_rm=Simon Peiji}} to {{Lang|mini=1|ko=시무스・페그|ko_rm=Simuseu Pegeu}},<ref name="barbarastory4" /><ref name="jeanstory5" /> but this change was not reflected in Barbara's Hangout Event.<ref name="barbarahangout" />
** His name remains unchanged in Chinese ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=西蒙・佩奇|zh_rm=Xīméng Pèiqí}}), Japanese ({{Lang|mini=1|ja=サイモン・ペッチ|ja_rm=Saimon Pecchi}}), and French (Seamus Page).
** In Japanese, his name is inconsistently localized as {{Lang|mini=1|ja=サイモン・ペイジ|ja_rm=Saimon Peiji}} in Barbara's Hangout Event.<ref name="barbarahangout" /> It is unknown which one is correct.
