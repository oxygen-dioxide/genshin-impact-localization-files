{{Lang|'''Yun Hui'''|zh=云辉|zh_rm=Yún Huī}} was the seventh master of the [[Yun Family]], a family renowned throughout [[Liyue]] for producing weapons. He ran the family forge up until he joined the [[Liyue Qixing]], after which it was passed down to his daughter, [[Yun Huang]].<ref name="BCW">{{Ref/Weapon|Blackcliff Warbow}}</ref>

==Story==
Yun Hui lived through the cataclysm five hundred years ago. After it subsided, monsters still ran rampant throughout [[Teyvat]], and people turned to supernatural arts to combat them. However, weapon production techniques were antiquated and the weapons they created broke easily.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Prototype Amber}}</ref> In response, Yun Hui collaborated with [[Han Wu]], another famous weaponsmith, to create the [[Prototype Series]] weapons.

At one point in time, Yun Hui helped Han Wu gather a crew to go to [[The Chasm]] and mine crystallized blackcliff, a rare type of ore. However, a cave-in trapped Han Wu and his men there for an unknown time. After Han Wu managed to break free, he emerged a changed man.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Blackcliff Longsword}}</ref>
