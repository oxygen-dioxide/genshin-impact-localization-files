{{Description|All those people you've met, those experiences you've had... Do you still remember them?<br>Let's revisit your adventures in Teyvat together!}}
'''Discover Teyvat''' is a [[Web Event]] in [[Version 4.2]].

==Event Duration==
November 8, 2023 – November 21, 2023 23:59 (UTC+8)

==Eligibility==
Reach [[Adventure Rank]] 1 or above

==Event Summary==
During the event, revisit the story of your adventure in Teyvat.

==Gameplay Details==
# Log into the event page to revisit the story of your adventure in Teyvat.
#* We have worked around the storyline of the Archon Quests in Version 4.1 when designing the Traveler's route, first encounters with new characters, and regional easter eggs in the "Archon Quests Route."
#* The "Event Quests Route" event settings are based on Version 4.1's Story Quests and Character Hangout Events. Some special characters are based on Event Quests from previous versions.
# Interact with characters, give them your well-wishes, and learn more about their stories to obtain "Lovely Sweet Flowers" that can be exchanged for 7 different virtual rewards. Each reward can only be obtained once, and a maximum of 7 rewards can be won. You will be able to claim all virtual rewards after exchanging for 7 rewards. Rewards are limited in quantity, so it's first come first served!
# Share the event for the first time to be eligible to participate in the physical rewards raffle. Once the event ends, winners will be drawn from among all those who shared it. Only one physical reward can be obtained by each participating account per event, but you can also win virtual rewards during the same event.
# Character stories showcased in the event are all official Character Teasers.

==Event Notes==
# After the list of physical reward winners is announced, reward delivery will be arranged for winners one by one.
# Physical rewards being shipped can be subject to customs duties in accordance with local policies. In such cases, the reward winners will be required to complete customs clearance procedures as well as cover corresponding taxes incurred.
# As HoYoLAB cannot oversee each individual delivery, {{Color|Pyro|we may have to share or entrust your personal data as outlined above to other third-party contractors (such as logistics service providers) for processing, and if necessary transfer it to a country/region outside of your country of residence}} to ensure that deliveries can be made successfully. HoYoLAB will select partners with caution and implement strict security measures to ensure that your personal data stays secure. If you have any questions about this, please contact: [http://hoyoverse.com privacy@hoyoverse.com]
# Participating Travelers in the event should enable Reward Notifications in HoYoLAB prior to the announcement, as we will notify you of the results via HoYoLAB system messages. If you do not enable notifications or do not complete delivery service registration in time and this affects the process of sending rewards, the rewards will not be re-issued.
