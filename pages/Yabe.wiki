==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Yabe is a Sangonomiya Samurai in the Stingray III Squad of the [[Watatsumi Army]]. He was fond of horror stories since he was a child.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref>  He is deeply invested in the legend of the "Bunkoku Enigma," but is aware that endeavoring to uncover the mystery may be perilous. As a result, while he entreats the Traveler to help him investigate it, he withholds information until they ascertain that there is some truth to the legend.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Bunkoku Enigma}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Yabe wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, consisting of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without socks. His uniform features a ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest imprinted on it.
