==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Galathee:''' Will I ever be able to sail to the world's end?
:{{DIcon}} About your next route...
::'''Galathee:''' My first mate and I haven't really made plans just yet, but I do hope that we'll make it a little further.
::'''Galathee:''' Each time I return to land and look back upon the route that we just took in this manner, I can't help but sigh...
::'''Galathee:''' Even the longest of sea routes is still all too short when seen from on high.
::'''Galathee:''' Perhaps one cannot traverse every river and every ocean in a single lifetime.
::'''Galathee:''' But since I've chosen this path... You never know what you'll encounter unless you try, right? Haha.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Like the constant adventures.
:::'''Galathee:''' Yes, my friend, precisely.
:::'''Galathee:''' Navigating to the end of the world is my goal, and the process of achieving it is just as important.
:::'''Galathee:''' Though I am not an adventurer, my adventuring experiences are just as thrilling as theirs.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Adventurer's Experience|x=4}})
;(Available after Step 9 of ''[[Soloist's Prologue]]'' but before completing ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]'')
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
::'''Galathee:''' Although there have been instances of rising water levels in our history, I'm inclined to focus on my current life and what I'll do before the prophecy comes to pass.
::'''Galathee:''' I mean, everyone must return to their home and set their feet on solid ground one day, after having departed on countless voyages.
::'''Galathee:''' As for distant dangers like prophecies, I think it's best left to long-lived beings such as deities.
;(Available after completing ''[[The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the prophecy...
::'''Galathee:''' About that... I heard that when the prophecy occurred, the chaos was worst around the [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]]. Romaritime Harbor was too far away, and all sorts of rumors were flying around.
::'''Galathee:''' Some people said that the Hydro Archon did all she could to prevent the ultimate disaster, while others said it was Monsieur [[Neuvillette]] who resolved it...
::'''Galathee:''' Well, seeing as Lady [[Furina]] has, indeed, left her post, I'm leaning more towards... the former statement?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Galathee:''' See you, friend. Sail safe!
