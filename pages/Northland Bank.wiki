The '''Northland Bank''' is a location in [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Liyue]]. It is a [[Snezhnaya]]n bank.

The bank was set up sometime before the [[Traveler]] arrived in Liyue. The bank is known for giving out generous loans to prospective clients. They are likely controlled by the [[Fatui]], as the Fatui themselves have a Debt Collection division that specifically goes after clients with outstanding debts to the bank.

During normal (non-event) dialogue, Ekaterina refuses to confirm any direct ties to the Fatui (despite wearing a Fatui uniform herself), but concedes that Harbingers are some of their clients.

The Mora bags of Northland Bank have elemental energy that verifies them as one of theirs.

The Northland Bank is a major location in Chapter 1 of the [[Archon Quests]], where it was used as a rendezvous point for the [[Traveler]] and [[Childe]]. During "[[Rite of Descension]]," Childe has the Traveler meet him there after escaping the Millelith. The Traveler returns there during the start of "[[An Organization Known as Wangsheng]]," and goes there a final time during "[[The Fond Farewell]]" in search of [[Zhongli]].

Inside the bank, in the back room from the right-hand stairs, a Precious [[Chest]] containing 200,000 Mora can be looted.

===Mora Exchange===
If the player has leftover funds from [[Childe]] via the Archon Quest "[[Downtown]]" ([[A Huge Bag of Mora]]) or the Story Quest "[[Teucer's Terrific Tour]]" ([[Childe and Teucer's Mora Pouch]]), the funds can be exchanged for [[Mora]].
