{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Northland Bank|It|Northland Bank}} is a [[Snezhnaya]]n bank with branches all over the world, which are sometimes used by [[Fatui]] personnel as their base of operations.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Others|Fatui|quote=The Northland Bank hails from Snezhnaya, and has branches in many places.

The '''Northland Bank''' is a major location in Chapter 1 of the [[Archon Quests]], where it was used as a rendez-vous point for the [[Traveler]] and [[Tartaglia]]. During ''[[Rite of Descension]]'', Childe has the Traveler meet him there after escaping the Millelith. The Traveler returns there during the start of ''[[An Organization Known as Wangsheng]]'', and goes there a final time during ''[[The Fond Farewell]]'' in search of [[Zhongli]].

==Lore==
The Northland Bank branch in Liyue was set up sometime before the [[Traveler]] arrived and is known for giving out generous loans to prospective clients, although some of their rivals, such as [[Gentry De'an]], claim that they used underhanded methods to establish themselves in Liyue.

The bank claims to be "no ordinary bank" and embodies the values of Snezhnaya, primarily loyalty and promises. While they are generous in giving out loans to prospective clients, they request that the loan be paid on full in time, and become particularly upset should the loan not be paid in full and/or on time. The Fatui have a Debt Collection division, of which one of their roles is to help collect any outstanding debts to the bank. [[Tartaglia]], when not busy with his Harbinger roles, occasionally helps the bank out with collecting debts. When he and [[Javert]] confronted the former owner of [[Yanshang Teahouse]] over his debt, he also uncovered the owner's fraud and reported it to the [[Millelith]]. The owner's arrest allowed [[Yelan]] to take over the establishment as her own base of operations.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yelan|About Tartaglia}}</ref> Because of this, the bank has also gained a notorious reputation among borrowers.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Mister Qi}}</ref>

Ekaterina refuses to confirm any direct ties to the Fatui, despite wearing a Fatui uniform herself, but concedes that Harbingers are some of their clients. The bank also marks their bags with elemental energy, allowing them to determine whether or not it belongs to them.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Ekaterina}}</ref>
