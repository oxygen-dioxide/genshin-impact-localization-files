{{Location Intro|description=<p>It is a [[Snezhnaya]]n bank with branches all over the world, which are sometimes used by [[Fatui]] personnel as their base of operations.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Fatui|quote=The Northland Bank hails from Snezhnaya, and has branches in many places.

The Northland Bank is a major location in Chapter 1 of the [[Archon Quests]], where it was used as a rendezvous point for the [[Traveler]] and [[Childe]]. During ''[[Rite of Descension]]'', Childe has the Traveler meet him there after escaping the Millelith. The Traveler returns there during the start of ''[[An Organization Known as Wangsheng]]'', and goes there a final time during ''[[The Fond Farewell]]'' in search of [[Zhongli]].

Inside the bank, in the back room from the right-hand stairs, a Precious [[Chest]] containing 200,000 Mora can be looted.

===Mora Exchange===
If the player has leftover funds from [[Childe]] via the Archon Quest ''[[Downtown]]'' ([[A Huge Bag of Mora]]) or the Story Quest ''[[Teucer's Terrific Tour]]'' ([[Childe and Teucer's Mora Pouch]]), the funds can be exchanged for [[Mora]].

==Lore==
The Northland Bank branch in Liyue was set up sometime before the [[Traveler]] arrived and is known for giving out generous loans to prospective clients, although some of their rivals, such as [[Gentry De'an]], claim that they used underhanded methods to establish themselves in Liyue.

The Fatui have a Debt Collection division that specifically goes after clients with outstanding debts to the bank. While confronting the former owner of [[Yanshang Teahouse]] for his debt to the Northland Bank, Childe came across the Sigil of Permission in his possession and took it for himself. He also uncovered the owner's fraud and reported it to the [[Millelith]]. The owner's arrest allowed [[Yelan]] to take over the establishment as her own base of operations.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yelan|About Tartaglia}}</ref>

Ekaterina refuses to confirm any direct ties to the Fatui, despite wearing a Fatui uniform herself, but concedes that Harbingers are some of their clients. While showing one of Childe's Mora bags to her (if the player has excess funds from him), she also reveals that the Mora bags from Northland Bank are marked with elemental energy that verifies them as one of theirs.

===Other Northland Bank Branches===
[[Pantalone]] is in charge of the Northland Bank's operations as a whole,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Andrei|s=Daytime}}</ref> although the establishment of new branches may be handled by other Harbingers, such as [[Pulcinella]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Equivalent Exchange Once More}}</ref> A new branch is being opened up in [[Sumeru City]] at the time the Traveler arrives.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Kalimi Exchange Bulletin Board|Northland Bank Notice}}</ref>
