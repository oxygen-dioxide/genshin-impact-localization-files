==Description==
"Sincerity and diligence will surely be rewarded. That's what you always taught us, Mother."<br>
"But those who favor sincerity are often liars, and the diligent will be exploited by others."<br>
"Mother, it turns out you were a liar too. Why else would you be buried here?"<br>
"And so, I must thank you. I now finally understand your true teachings..."<br>
Before a piece of wood becomes an axe's haft, it can neither be picky about methods nor too fastidious about dignity.<br>
Whether cumbersome formal attire or rags stained with grease and blood, all are costumes required to move upwards.

In those times — nay, perhaps even were a thousand, or ten thousand years to pass since then—<br>
There will always be young people who grow up all too soon, who rise up in society under the banner of the so-called "survival of the fittest,"<br>
Who will feed upon sincerity, gorge upon hope, and devour dreams, metamorphosing into a magnificent monster of the [[Court of Fontaine|city above ground]],<br>
For whom the two cities, whether touched or untouched by sunlight, were both bountiful hunting grounds.

"Oh my. Whose [[Leticia|daughter]] might you be, gentle lady, and what brings you to our [[Fleuve Cendre]]?"<br>
As for the noble girl who had stumbled into the Fleuve Cendre, she was, naturally, quarry most worthy of being hung upon the mantlepiece...<br>
How the fear dims her beautiful visage, like clouds choking the moon, thought the monster.<br>
She recognized the face of a monster, but what slipped out instead was a question as to how her disguise had been discovered.<br>
"Well, you're a terrible liar, for one. You've as much as admitted to being an outsider now, haven't you?"<br>
"...And my dear lady, your clothes lack either soot or machine oil, nor have they ever been stained by blood..."

Yes, yes — this was a wondrous opportunity, not to be missed, he thought, as he reached out his hand to her.<br>
The threads of spider's silk silently hanging down from the clouds above. I shall use this to enter that greatest of houses,<br>
This ladder unto the skies, this key unto the gates of pearl.<br>
I must not let her leave me... I must never leave her...

"Leticia, your noble soul is one I adore."<br>
A peculiar foreboding struck him as he spoke these words, but nevertheless, he continued to speak...

...<br>
All things have their portents, and that was the night before the storm,<br>
And strangely, he was uncharacteristically nattering on about his selfish wishes:<br>
"Leticia, have you ever imagined a world—"<br>
"One with three times the sunshine and boundless fertile lands,"<br>
"One where people are free as birds, free of segregation, free from deception and despoiling,"<br>
"Where we may fly across boundless plains, or rivers and lakes, mountains and valleys,"<br>
"Until we find a tree to call our own, roost there, and build our home,"<br>
"With no one to disturb us, and nothing to trouble us..."

Perhaps by then, he already believed that the once ephemeral hope had now vanished like smoke,<br>
Or had already been buried in silence and blood alongside their comrades.

"Dear Leticia, think of the children, of those newly sprouted trees,"<br>
"Surely they should not be born amidst cannon fire, or grow up amidst the mud and filthy waters."<br>
"Are we to nurture them with wrathful tears and hateful oaths?"<br>
"Shall we leave them to inherit confused dreams or a mission with its outlook yet unknown?"

But no, there is no need to worry, he thought. Everything has already been arranged.<br>
Our future... My future... It is assured.<br>
And again, he felt a bout of that now-familiar, peculiar foreboding.

...<br>
By then, he had not walked amongst nobles for some time already. When asked the reason for his betrayal,<br>
"To be rewarded with a position higher still." "To win peace for her and the children."<br>
He no longer remembered which was the pretext, and which was the truth.<br>
For when a liar tells a lie ten thousand times, even they themselves may believe it.

So when his wife asked him that same question at the last, he still had not figured it out.<br>
But he remembered the promise he had made to her. If nothing else, they two alone could keep their initial contract.
