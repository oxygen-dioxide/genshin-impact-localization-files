|text    = Hello, cutie~ You know, we haven't seen each other for quite some time. You haven't forgotten about me, given how busy you are traveling the world, have you?

Otherwise, you'd make me really sad.

What a lovely day, isn't it? It just so happens that the flowers in the vase are blooming so vibrantly. Perhaps you'd like to have a look and pay me a visit? We can take advantage of the good weather and I can tell you more about the stories of my studies at the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]]. That way, when you set foot in the land of [[Sumeru]], you can tell me more about its recent changes~

Shhh... You know what day it is. It's not often that I'd personally cook dinner and you know that, don't you? Ah, speaking of which, you must've wondered where that purple tint on the Bolognese came from. Hehe, I promise you will soon find out the answer.

Now, I'm really looking forward to seeing if my "magic" can trigger the electric sparks between you and me again.

Hehe~
