==Steps==
Interact with the Ruin Tablet in [[Minlin]] to receive the quest.

#Look for clues to opening the stone tablet (0/3)
#*The Light Actuators (floating light shapes) need to be carried to the Ruin Tablet. Opening the chests is not enough.

===Light Actuator Locations===
#Inside the Hilichurl Camp, north of the Ruin Tablet.
#*Defeat the {{enemy|Stonehide Lawachurl}} and the other Hilichurls to access the hut containing the Light Actuator and a {{item|Precious Chest}}.
#**It is possible to skip the fight by jumping through a window in the back of the hut. You will likely sustain damage though, and the chest won't unlock.
#On a stone platform, east-southeast of the Ruin Tablet.
#*When you go near it, the Light Actuator and the {{item|Precious Chest}} will be locked by a barrier. Defeat the {{enemy|Hydro Abyss Mage}} and the Hilichurls to unlock them.
#Inside a ruined tower, south of the Ruin Tablet.
#*Climb the tallest peak southwest of the ruins, then glide onto the tower's roof. Glide down into the room from the hole on the roof. The gates will unlock, allowing access to the Light Actuator.
#*To unlock the {{item|Exquisite Chest}}, you must activate the 2 [[Geo Lamp]]s.
#**Break one of the [[Geogranum]] crystals on the ground and bring the Geogranum up to the Geo Lamp on the 2nd floor. (The {{enemy|Ruin Guard}} will activate if you go near it.)
#**Break the crystal beside the ramp leading to the tower and quickly bring the Geogranum up to the Geo Lamp on the 3rd floor.

:'''Ruin Tablet:''' "My name is [[Bosacius]], one of the [[Yaksha]]s. I followed [[Morax|my Lord]] to fight against and contend with pestilence. Yet though we Yakshas had great might, we were bound by our duties, and stained by them..."
:'''Ruin Tablet:''' "...[[Liyue]] is now at peace, but of our number, none but [[Xiao|Alatus]] and I remain. And for my part, I wish to depart, to be done with this world."
:'''Ruin Tablet:''' "...My wealth I leave here, sealed by my arts. If you are fated to do so, take them as you please..."
