==Steps==
Interact with the Ruin Tablet in [[Minlin]] to receive the quest.

#Look for clues to opening the stone tablet (0/3)
#*Need to carry the Light Actuators (floating light shapes) to the Ruin Tablet, opening the chests is not enough.

===Light Actuator Locations===
#Inside the Hilichurl Camp, north of the Ruin Tablet.
#*Defeat the {{Enemy|Stonehide Lawachurl}} and the other Hilichurls to access the hut containing a Precious Chest and the Light Actuator.
#*It is possible to skip the fight by jumping through a window in the back of the hut. You will likely sustain damage though, and the chest won't unlock.
#On a stone platform, east-southeast of the Ruin Tablet.
#*When you go near it, the Light Actuator and the Precious Chest will be locked by a barrier. Defeat the {{Enemy|Hydro Abyss Mage}} and the Hilichurls to unlock it.
#Inside a ruined tower, south of the Ruin Tablet.
#*Climb the tallest peak southwest of the ruins, then glide onto the roof of the tower.
#*Glide down into the room from the hole on the roof. The gates will unlock, allowing access to the Light Actuator. To unlock the Exquisite Chest, you must activate the 2 [[Geo Lamp]]s.
#*Break one of the [[Geogranum]] crystals on the ground to acquire a Geograna and bring it up to the Geo Lamp on the 2nd floor. The {{Enemy|Ruin Guard}} will activate if you go near it.
#*Break the crystal beside the ramp leading to the tower and quickly bring the Geograna up to the Geo Lantern on the 3rd floor.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Upon starting this quest, the player cannot enter [[Co-Op Mode]] until it is complete, even if the quest is not the player's current navigating quest.
*After completing the quest, get the 3 Precious Chests in the ruins south of the Ruin Tablet.
