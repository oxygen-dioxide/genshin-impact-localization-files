'''Versions''' (or '''Updates'''/'''Patches''') are significant updates in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. Each version normally lasts 6 weeks or 42 days.<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/38231 Future Versions and Events]</ref>

Versions are labeled through a {{w|Software versioning#Sequence-based identifiers|sequence-based identifier}} versioning scheme which reflects change significance. ''Genshin Impact''{{'}}s version numbers follow the format of many other versioning sequences, incrementing the left-most number for major updates and the right-most number for bug fixes; for most 6-week version updates, the second number in the version tag is the one that is incremented. For very significant or large version updates, such as the introduction of a new primary region in [[Teyvat]], the first number may be incremented instead.

The first patch in each version has the version number X.Y.0 and future patches (X.Y.1, X.Y.2, etc.) fix major problems with the game that require a client update through the Game Launcher or App Store.

==Maintenance==
All maintenances except for the Version 1.0.1 maintenance were scheduled to last 5 hours. The Version 1.0.1 maintenance was scheduled to last 4 hours. They usually start at 06:00 UTC+8. Compensation for maintenance is {{Item|Primogem|30|x=60}} for each hour the server is down and the minimum compensation is determined by the expected maintenance duration (ex. scheduled 5 hour maintenance means at least {{Item|Primogem|30|x=300}} even if it only lasts 4 hours). Sometimes bug fixes give a compensation of {{Item|Primogem|30|x=300}}.

Starting one hour prior to maintenance, scrolling banners will periodically appear in-game at the top of the screen. The banners appear at 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 minute(s) prior the scheduled maintenance time. The banners state:
*Dear Travelers, ''Genshin Impact'' servers will be down for maintenance in about ''{X}''m. Please plan your game time and progress accordingly. For more details, see the in-game notice.

==Trivia==
* Most of the Version names in Chinese, from Versions 1.1–1.5, 2.3–2.7, are composed of five {{w|Chinese characters|characters}}.
** Versions 1.6 and 2.8 feature summer theme, and their Version names are composed of seven characters in the form of "XX! XX? XXX!"
** Versions 2.0 and 2.1 feature Inazuma archon quests, and their Version names are wordplay of the quest names, in the form of "XXXX, XXXX."
* It is possible to remain within the game for a few minutes after the scheduled maintenance time, but the player will be returned to the title screen after.
* [[Version 1.0]], [[Version 2.6]], and [[Version 2.7]] are the only versions that have lasted longer than 6 weeks.
** Version 1.0 lasted approximately 6 weeks and 2 days.
** Version 2.6 lasted almost 9 weeks.
** Version 2.7 lasted 6 weeks and 1 day, as its update happened 24 hours earlier than the usual day of the week for maintenances.
* [[Version 3.0]], [[Version 3.1]], and [[Version 3.2]] are the only versions that have lasted 5 weeks.<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/6947169 Versions 3.0 – 3.2 Duration Details]</ref>
** This was likely due to the the extended duration of [[Version 2.6]] to get back to original schedule.
* [[Version 1.3]] is currently the only version which had three [[Character Event Wishes]] not overlapping with one another. For the PC version, the time during the [[Dance of Lanterns]] wish did not have a unique splashscreen within the game's launcher.
* For the [[Version 2.0]] update, the maintenance banner showed the following due to the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]] being a temporary addition of [[Version 1.6]]:
** Dear Traveler, the game servers will be down for maintenance at around ''XX''m. After the maintenance, you will no longer be able to head to the island, so please plan your game progress to avoid missing out. For more details, please refer to the in-game announcement.
* During the versions near Chinese New Year, announcements for [[Event]]s and [[Event Wishes]] were made prior the start of the version.
** This is likely to make all announcements before the holidays to allow people to plan their activities better, or for the developers have time off.
