|description = One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. It seems quite old now, but the etchings are still very clear, and so it can still be used.<br />The sun is a rare sight down in The Chasm, and it is easy to lose track of time. But someday, this sundial will once again track the passage of years.
