|text    = The other [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]] paid me a visit and took all of my work upon themselves. They ignored my protests, saying that I deserve to relax today. I appreciate their kindness, but... I do not see the need to celebrate my birthday.

As a child, I always spent my birthday with my [[Frederica Gunnhildr|mother]]. To bystanders, it must have seemed most unusual. We would do away with the usual entertainment and birthday cake, opting for a simple trip to [[Windrise]].

I do not mean to complain, I have grown used to that tradition. This is why I am not accustomed to the notion of having a birthday banquet.

Forgoing all fun may disappoint the others, but a grand ceremony also seems out of place. Birthdays require much deliberation indeed...

I would like to discuss this issue with [[Traveler|you]] face to face and listen to your suggestions.

You have seen a lot during your travels, so perhaps you can recommend a fitting celebration method, or... Perhaps our meeting can be the celebration.
