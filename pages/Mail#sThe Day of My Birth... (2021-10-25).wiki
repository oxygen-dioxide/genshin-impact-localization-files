|text    = Traditionally, birthday celebrations for the [[Lawrence Clan]] are occasions marked by a myriad of rules and rituals. We are also very selective with who we invite. It's so troublesome, it makes you never want to have birthdays ever again.

But since I am no longer bound to such trifles, I no longer care for them. Right now, you're the only one invited. Let's forget about such trivialities and the status difference between the two of us. Think of me as just "Eula" for today.

We can go skiing in [[Dragonspine]]. The winter breeze can be biting but it is also refreshing.

Don't forget to layer up, otherwise I'll have to wrap my cloak around you.

...And if that happens, I shall remember this grievance for the rest of my life.
