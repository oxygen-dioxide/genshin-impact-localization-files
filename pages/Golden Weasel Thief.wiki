{{Description|Thieves that come and go like the wind, though they only do so out of pure instinct.<br />The Golden Weasel Thief is a master thief, the most adept and the rarest of all the weasel thieves. Supposedly, the weasel thief was born when one Treasure Hoarder had the unusual idea to train up wild weasels as formal members of the organization.<br />No formal records exist, however, so the truth of this theory cannot be known. Regardless, given the size of a weasel thief's backpack, one highly doubts that they are a particularly lucrative source of wealth for the Treasure Hoarders.|in-game description from the [[Archive]]}}
