{{About|the in-universe languages found in the world of ''Genshin Impact''|the game setting|Settings#Language}}
There are many different '''languages''' and '''scripts''' in [[Teyvat]], most of them based on real-world languages.

Aside from [[Hilichurlian]] and [[#Ishine Script|Ishine Script]], all language names are unofficial.

==Other Languages==
===Mondstadt Script===
[[File:Angel's Share Sign.png|thumb|Example of the Mondstadt Language at the bottom of the sign]]
Certain signs in Mondstadt appear to use a script that is not the [[Teyvat Script]]. These signs have words written using the {{w|Roman alphabet}} with certain sections removed and the entire written item flipped horizontally. There is also variation between likely instances of the same letter.

Signs with this script:
* An emblem of the Mondstadt branch of the Adventurers' Guild emblem; likely reads "{{Not a typo|Monde}}" ("{{Not a typo|MOnDE}}")
* Logo of the [[Angel's Share]]; likely reads "{{sic|Angle Share}}" ("{{Not a typo|ANGLEShArE}}")
* Inn sign; likely reads "Inn" ("Inn")
{{clr}}

===Enochian-Based Language===

The script for this language appears while [[Abyss Mages]] are chantingn to regenerate their shields as well as over their heads when performing spells outside of combat, whether alone or in the company of hilichurls such as in the commission ''[[Spreading Evil]]''. This is likely the long-forgotten language mentioned in the Adventurer Handbook as what gives the Abyss Mages their magical power. The script is based on the {{w|Enochian}} alphabet, but attempts to decrypt it have only yielded unintelligible text, as the letter sequences appear to be randomly generated.

The script also appears in the yellow protective runes around the weak points of [[Automatons]], where the mirrored glyphs for B, L, and G circle around the core. [[Ruin Guard]]s are known to have been made by the people of [[Khaenri'ah]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Herald Without Adherents}}</ref> many of whom turned into "monsters of the Abyss,"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref> so this script was possibly used in Khaenri'ah as well.

There is only one instance of the Enochian-based language being transcribed into another discernable language: In the cinematic at the end of {{Quest|Crash Course}}, the Hydro Abyss Mage says a line that is transcribed in the subtitles as "Gohus, Chiso Vonph" in the Roman alphabet, regardless of the player's set language. This translates from Enochian as something along the lines of "I say, they are angry." While the line itself does not appear otherwise, the Hydro Abyss Mage says the line while performing an animation similar to the shield regeneration animation, during which letters from the alphabet appear. The same line can also be heard by players in regular gameplay when Abyss Mages finish regenerating their shields.

===Runes===
[[File:Tutorial Enemies Pyro Abyss Mage.png|thumb|Example of Runes where symbols including ᛉ and ᛗ can be seen]]
Runes resembling {{w|Elder Futhark}} runes can be seen in the [[Tutorial]] images for the [[Abyss Mages]], seemingly when they are about to regenerate their shields. However, since Version 1.0, the symbols that appear around Abyss Mages are in the Enochian-based language instead.

===Adeptus Script===
[[File:Adeptus Language.png|thumb|Example of the Adeptus Script]]
This script has only been found on [[Adeptus Bridge]]s. It is presumably used by the [[Adepti]].
{{clr}}

===Ishine Script===
{{See also|Ishine Script}}
[[File:Ishine Script on Mount Kanna.png|thumb|The [[Seven Letters|seven letters]] of the Ishine Script]]
The Ishine Script was only known by the priestly families in the civilization that once inhabited [[Tsurumi Island]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Octave of the Maushiro}}</ref> The language of the script was used to name people, places, and other things on the island.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna}}</ref> This language is likely based on the {{w|Ainu language}} in real life. For example, [[Kama]] means "a very big rock," which corresponds to the Ainu word {{Lang|''kama''|ain=カマ}}, meaning "flat rock." However, the letters of the Ishine Script do not bear any obvious similarities to Ainu writing.<!--There is one letter that looks like ン, but nothing obvious for any of the other letters, so it is likely only a coincidence.-->
{{clr}}

===Tanuki Language===
According to [[Ioroi]], Tanuki can understand human speech by nature, but also possess their own language amongst themselves. Ioroi is able to prepare a magical food which allows Traveler to understand some Tanuki speech but much of it still comes out as gibberish such as when [[Kichiboushi]] says "squelch squelch lavender melon." According to Ioroi, this confusion is caused by the Traveler having yet to be accustomed to Kichiboushi's aura, a statement which is supported by the fact that communication with Kichiboushi gets clearer throughout the journey with him.

===Aranara Language===
[[File:Silapna Leaf.png|thumb|Example of the Aranara Language written on a Silapna Leaf]]
{{Transclude|Aranara Language|Description|section=1|main=1|top=1}}
{{Clr}}

==Ciphers==
===Jade Chamber===
{{Main|Jade Chamber#Trivia}}
If you decipher the series of numbers in the Strange Notebook you get "The Fatui will strike the Golden House". The text can be deciphered by referring a book about Rex Lapis's death that can be found on Ningguang's desk. The code numbers are a modified {{w|book cipher}}, written in the format <code>[sentence]:[word]:[letter]|[letter]</code>. The letters from these codes will spell out the message.

===Cryptic Message in Dragonspine===
{{Main|Cryptic Message in Dragonspine#Lore}}
Nine Ruin Guards located throughout Dragonspine contain cryptic Record of Serial No. messages that can be deciphered to read "For the nation, we can't forgo this skyborne power, but we failed."

===Cryptic Message in Sumeru===
{{Main|Cryptic Message in Sumeru#Lore}}
Five Ruin Guards located throughout Sumeru contain cryptic messages that can be deciphered to read "We Schwanenritters have fought to the last one."

==Real Life Languages==
So far, the following real life languages have been used extensively, although none appear in written form in the world of Genshin Impact as they do in real life:
{| class="fandom-table sortable"
|-
! Language !! Primarily seen in relation to...
|-
| Ainu || [[Tsurumi Island]]
|-
| Egyptian || [[Great Red Sand]] ([[Sumeru]])
|-
| English || [[Mondstadt]]
|-
| Greek || [[Enkanomiya]]
|-
| Japanese || [[Inazuma]]
|-
| Latin || See [[Latin-Based Language]]
|-
| Mandarin Chinese || [[Liyue]]
|-
| Persian || [[Dharma Forest]] ([[Sumeru]])
|-
| Russian || [[Snezhnaya]]
|-
| Sanskrit || [[Dharma Forest]] ([[Sumeru]])
|}

Other real life languages that have been used include the following (examples are non-exhaustive):
* Arabic (NPCs and locations in [[Sumeru]])
* Dutch ([[Vermeer]])
* Finnish ([[Ukko]])
* French (NPCs and locations in [[Fontaine]])
* German (Various things in [[Mondstadt]])
* Hebrew (Names of the [[Hypostases]], [[Teyvat]])
* Hungarian ([[Orban]])
* Proto-Japonic ([[Kuntira]])
* Italian (Names of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]])
* Hindi ([[Kaushik]])
* Old Norse ([[Sal Vindagnyr]], [[Imunlaukr]], [[Gunnhildr]], [[Ragnvindr]], [[Ulfr]], [[Ylgr]])
* A Slavic language ([[Krsnik Noc]])
* Spanish ([[Six-Fingered José]])

==Manga-Only Scripts==
The ''Genshin Impact'' [[manga]] was published from 2018 to 2019, before the official global launch of the game.

===Common Script===
[[File:Manga Common Script.png|thumb|right|Letter read by Il Dottore in [[Ludi Harpastum (Manga)|Chapter 9]] of the manga]] In the Genshin Impact [[manga]], which was published in 2018 to 2019, an indecipherable script can be seen in papers throughout the story, such as in the letter that [[Il Dottore]] receives from the [[Knights of Favonius]] in Chapter 9. It is likely a written lingua franca.

As this script has not been seen in official media since Genshin Impact's launch and all instances of the script appear to be filler text due to repetition of the same lines, this script was likely a placeholder and ultimately scrapped.
{{clr}}
===English===
[[File:Manga Monde Library Stamp.png|thumb|Stamp seen in [[Dangerous Grounds|Chapter 5]] of the manga]] In the manga, in Chapter 5, there is a circular stamp reading "THE CHIVALRY OF THE WEST WIND - MONDE LIBRARY" in English.

The regular use of English as-is has likely been scrapped.
{{clr}}
===Ancient Script===
[[File:Manga Ancient Script.png|thumb|Ancient language in a Fatui document seen in [[Wind and Fyre|Chapter 6]] of the manga]] In the manga, there is a partially-burned two-sided [[Fatui]] document about [[Crepus|Crepus Ragnvindr]]'s [[Delusion]] and the syringe that was used on [[Collei]]. The content pertaining to the Delusion was written in the common script, as it appears to use the same written script and Amber and Jean both read it,<ref>{{Ref/Manga|6}}</ref> but the content pertaining to the syringe was written in an "ancient language."<ref>{{Ref/Manga|8}}</ref> It has dots and a blocky style like the [[Deshret Script]]. The [[Liyue Script]] also has a similar blocky style but has no dots.

This script has not been seen in-game and may have been scrapped or updated.

==Trivia==
* There are very few instances of any existing scripts on Earth appearing as-is in the world of Teyvat. The only known instances are:
** The Roman alphabet
*** Playing cards found in the open world{{verify|where?}}
*** [[Tattered Paper]] image, which appears to say "S to J" in the bottom right
*** [[Layla's List of Orders]] image, which may say "Quest!" on the first line
** Simplified Chinese
*** The [[Unusual Hilichurl]] has a Simplified Chinese character on its mask as a reference to Liu Wei, one of HoYoverse's co-founders.
