The '''Seven Sovereigns''' are the seven strongest elemental [[dragons]] of their respective element.<ref name="The Eve">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref>

The original Seven Sovereigns were the rulers of the old world before the appearance of the [[Primordial One]]. After 40 years of battle, the Seven Sovereigns were vanquished and those who refused to yield to the Primordial One fled to the depths of the ocean.<ref name="before sun and moon">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref>

A new generation of Sovereigns is currently being born;<ref name="bolt hatch">{{Ref/Enemy|Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap Hatchling}}</ref> it has been predicted that at least the Hydro one will be "born in a human form."<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records}}</ref>

==Overview==
Like all vishaps and elemental dragons, the Seven Sovereigns are creatures of the [[Light Realm]] and harness one of the primordial elements. The Seven Sovereigns were the mightiest among dragon-kind<ref name="The Eve" /> and ruled over the old world and its seven nations.

When the Primordial One &mdash; the eternal throne of the heavens &mdash; appeared, it and its four shining shades waged war against the Seven Sovereigns. After a long struggle, the Primordial One vanquished the Seven Sovereigns and began remaking the world to be suitable for humanity, establishing the [[Human Realm]]. Those who refused to yield to the Primordial One fled into the ocean depths.<ref name="before sun and moon" />

With the original Seven Sovereigns' power fading away, a new generation is being born.<ref name="bolt hatch" />

==Trivia==
*[[Azhdaha]] is theorized to be one of the Seven Sovereigns of the Vishap Realm, as he is stated to be extremely old and is an elemental dragon.<ref name="The Eve" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref> He is also referred to as a {{lang|"dragon king"|zh=龙王}}<ref>{{Ref/Item|Bloodjade Branch}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Trails in Tianqiu}}</ref> and as the {{lang|"Sealed Lord of Vishaps"|zh=被封印的岩龙之王|zh_tl=Sealed King of Geo Dragons.}}<ref>{{Ref/Domain|Beneath the Dragon-Queller}}</ref><ref group="Note">In the Chinese version of "Sealed Lord of Vishaps," {{lang|"Geo Dragons"|zh=岩龙}} is likely a truncated form of {{lang|"Geovishap"|zh=岩龙蜥|zh_tl=Geo Dragon-Lizard}}; alternatively, it refers to all Geo dragons, which encompasses but is not limited to Geovishaps.</ref> This is similar to the original Dragon of Water's description as a "dragon-lord" (along with the other original Seven Sovereigns)<ref name="before sun and moon" /> and an "ancient lord of vishaps."<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|6|In the Light, Beneath the Shadow}}</ref><ref group="Note">In the Chinese version of ''In the Light, Beneath the Shadow'', the section equivalent to "the Dragon of Water, the ancient lord of vishaps," is simply {{lang|mini=1|zh=水之元素龙王|zh_tl=Hydro Dragon King/Lord}} and makes no direct reference to vishaps.</ref> However, the title of "dragon king/lord" is not exclusively used for the Seven Sovereigns, and too little is known about the Primordial One's era or the world that came before it to determine Azhdaha's place among them.
**The title of {{lang|mini=1|zh=龙王|zh_tl=Dragon King}} is shared with [[Beidou]], likely in relation to her slaying of the sea monster [[Haishan]]. This title is translated as "Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean," or some variation thereof, in the English localization.
*The Seven Sovereigns are stated to be elemental dragons that are the prime embodiment of their elements of the Vishap/Light Realm.<ref name="The Eve"/> As one of the two known elemental dragons aside from Azhdaha, [[Dvalin]] might have some link to them as well.

The English localization is inconsistent in its translations of {{lang|mini=1|zh=龙王}} and interprets it as both "king" and "lord," if not recontextualizing the phrase entirely.
