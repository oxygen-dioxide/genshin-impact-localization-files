|description  = Xianyun's outfit. These garments were not designed by any famous tailor, though at first glance, they appear to be made of the finest silks. Yet closer inspection reveals that the weave is not of silk, cotton, or linen, and a glow runs through it like an adeptus's feather coat. One can only imagine from what provenance she obtained such clothes...

'''A Guest's August Omen''' is [[Xianyun]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Xianyun's dress is black, holding a flowy and tight-fitting style. Her dress has golden engravings and cloud-like shapes while also showing details in different shades of blue. She also wears sheer black tights underneath the dress. Her heels are black, however they are embellished with golden wings and tips. Her {{Anemo}} [[Vision]] is set upon her right shoulder on an orange knot.

Some of Xianyun's accessories include red glasses, an orange tassel earring on her right ear, a black and blue feather pinning her hair up in a high ponytail, and sheer black sleeves extending all the way to her fingertips akin to gloves. Her sleeves also include a deep blue layer of fabric over the top along with golden bands. She also wears a sort of pale, sea-green coat or cape which resembles a texture similar to the feathers of a bird that covers her neck and drapes down her back. A long tassel drops from her throat to her upper abdomen in gold and yellow.
