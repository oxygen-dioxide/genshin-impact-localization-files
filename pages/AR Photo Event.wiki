#Take a photo of Amber, and the eager Outrider will give you a piece of the puzzle. Travelers can search #genshinimpact on Instagram to find the other pieces and solve the puzzle. Hint: There are six puzzle pieces scattered across the world!
#Share the photo of Amber on social media (Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter), including the puzzle solution along with the hashtags #genshinpuzzle and #genshinimpact &mdash; you now have a chance to win a great prize!
