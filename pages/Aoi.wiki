{{Dialogue Start}}
: {{DIcon|Idle}} You can find everything...
:: {{A|VO Aoi 01.ogg}} "You can find everything and anything in Tsukumomono Groceries."
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aoi:''' Tsukumomono Groceries. All your wishes granted in this one place!
:{{DIcon|GeneralGoods}} I'd like to make a purchase.
::'''Aoi:''' Your wish is my command. Please, pick anything you like.
:;(Opens Tsukumomono Groceries wares)
:{{DIcon}} You sell everything here, you mean?
::'''Aoi:''' That's right. "Tsukomomono" itself means "having almost everything." Similarly, our shop is dedicated to fulfilling the wishes of every customer.
::'''Aoi:''' Which means that as long as {{sic|can you}} offer the right price, you can buy anything.
::'''Aoi:''' Hehe... and as for how we got the goods. I'm afraid I cannot disclose that.
::{{DIcon}} One new Paimon, please.
::'''Aoi:''' Pai... mon? Oh, what is this? A flying doll that makes noises? Is... is this some antique imbued with genjutsu, by any chance?
::'''Aoi:''' Sorry, this is indeed a little... Please wait, dear customer. I shall have to consult my sources...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Aoi:''' Goodbye! Tsukumomono Groceries will be at your service anytime.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} {{Color|help|We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.}}
::'''Aoi:''' How strange. No one's ever invited me to go attend such an event before.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, that's why we're here! Hehe.
::'''Paimon:''' You must have music you really love, right, Aoi? We could play it for you &mdash; we're serious musicians!
::'''Aoi:''' Music, you say? Well... There is one that I heard a long while back. I was your height when I last heard it, I believe.
::'''Aoi:''' I only remember bits and pieces of it, but could you play it for me all the same?
::{{DIcon}} Sure, I'll give it a go.
::'''Aoi:''' Thank you.

;(After performing)
::'''Aoi:''' Ah... Lovely. It seems you're quite the dab hand at making others' wishes come true.
::'''Aoi:''' It's been almost twenty years since I last heard this tune. It was a boy in the neighborhood who played it for me.
::'''Aoi:''' His wish was to travel and see the outside world... It's just a shame that I couldn't have been the one to help him.
::'''Aoi:''' Heh, well, would you look at that? I've strayed from the topic. I'm afraid I can't help with this music festival. Tsukumomono Groceries can't do without me right now.
::'''Aoi:''' Still, I'm glad to have heard this once more. Thank you so much.

;(Talk to Aoi again, optional)
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} How was that?
:;(Same as ''After performing'')
