==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aoi:''' Tsukumomono Groceries. All your wishes granted in this one place!
:{{DIcon|GeneralGoods}} I'd like to make a purchase.
::'''Aoi:''' Your wish is my command. Please, pick anything you like.
:;(Opens Tsukumomono Groceries wares)
:{{DIcon}} You sell everything here, you mean?
::'''Aoi:''' That's right. "Tsukomomono" itself means "having almost everything." Similarly, our shop is dedicated to fulfilling the wishes of every customer.
::'''Aoi:''' Which means that as long as {{sic|can you}} offer the right price, you can buy everything.
::'''Aoi:''' Hehe... and as for how we got the goods. I'm afraid I cannot disclose that.
::{{DIcon}} One new Paimon, please.
::'''Aoi:''' Pai... mon? Oh, what is this? A flying doll that makes noises? Is... is this some antique imbued with genjutsu, by any chance?
::'''Aoi:''' Sorry, this is indeed a little... Please wait, dear customer. I shall have to consult my sources...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Aoi:''' Goodbye! Tsukumomono Groceries will be at your service anytime.
