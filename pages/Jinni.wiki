The '''Jinn''' (singular: '''Jinni''') are a mystical race of elemental spirits that were created by [[Nabu Malikata]].  After the goddess's death, they turned to serve [[King Deshret]]. Besides bottles, Jinn are also stated to indwell items such as weapons.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Xiphos' Moonlight}}</ref>

==Overview==
{{Quote|I'm a creation of the sky, yet also a creature of this world. I'm an exile of the ages, a faithful servant to my great lord. I'm an elemental spirit who will not bow to flesh and blood, an eternal prisoner content with the illusion of comfort...|The Jinni in [[The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle]]}}
Jinn are elemental spirits and have translucent bodies; while the female jinn described in legends are implied to have human-like features, the jinni in [[Dori]]'s lamp has a distinctly non-human appearance and instead appears as a spherical creature with a grinning face.

Jinn are believed to be capable of possessing a human's body, which one Jinni uses as a threat against the human boy she dubs "Raven."<ref name="Shepherd">{{Ref/Item|The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle}}</ref> Normally, however, they reside in items such as magic lamps or weapons.

==History==
The Jinn were born after Nabu Malikata was cast aside by the heavens, said to be birthed from "intoxicating dreams and the bitter memories of loss." Nabu Malikata wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two nights, her heels worn through by the gravel. The blood that gushed from those wounds turned into springs and streams, which subsequently flowed into gardens. The Jinn were born from the water lilies that grew in those gardens. The Jinn begged her to stay with them, and she agreed.<ref>Artifact, Flower of Paradise Lost: [[Ay-Khanoum's Myriad]]</ref>

Eventually, Nabu Malikata met King Deshret, and together they built the city of [[Ay-Khanoum]], a name which means "City of the Moon Maiden" in the Jinn's ancient language.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Oasis Garden's Mourning}}</ref> In stories that do not include the Goddess of Flowers, it is instead believed that King Deshret learned about the Jinn's story after capturing them and, afterwards, built Ay-Khanoum as a gift to the Jinn; in return, they built the entrance to the [[Mausoleum of King Deshret]].<ref name="Shepherd" />

The Jinn allegedly became willing servants of King Deshret in his endeavor to rule over the world, entering the silver magic bottles he created for them and becoming marked by his seal. Afterwards, they engaged in acts of creation and exploration on his behalf.<ref name="Shepherd" /> According to [[Liloupar]], King Deshret had deceived the Jinn to gain their servitude, telling them that the Goddess of Flowers had not perished but was instead locked in a deep slumber in [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]], and that he could awaken her with the Jinn's aid.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{Lang|{{w|Jinn}}|ar=جن}}, commonly anglicized as "genie" in English writing, are invisible creatures in Arabic religious systems that are not inherently good or evil. However, if hurt, they will take revenge on the person who wronged them or possess their body.
** The belief that jinni can be placed inside magical items was popularized by the story ''{{w|One Thousand and One Nights}}'', specifically in the tale of {{w|The Fisherman and the Jinni}}.
** The concept of King Deshret marking the Jinn with his seal is likely derived from the real-life legends surrounding the {{w|Seal of Solomon}}, which involves a ring engraved with said seal which allows its wearer to control jinni, given by God to the Israelite king {{w|Solomon}}.
