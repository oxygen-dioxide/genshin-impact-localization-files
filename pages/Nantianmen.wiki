{{Description|A strange tree whose branches flow with clear, cold moonlight. Perhaps its roots, that reach deep into the heart of the earth, are connected to something that awaits an opportunity to once again emerge and bask in the moon's light.|[[Viewpoints#Moonlit Tree: Nantianmen|Moonlit Tree]]}}

{{Lang|'''Nantianmen'''|zh=南天门|zh_rm=Nántiānmén|zh_tl=Southern Heavenly Gate}} is a subarea in [[Minlin]], [[Liyue]].

This region notably features the [[Dragon-Queller]], a large tree used to seal [[Azhdaha]], whom [[Jiu]] worships. The dragon has begun merging with the tree, using its roots to connect to the ley lines and draw power from them.

At the tip of the tree is a large blue branch, which points directly towards [[Liyue Harbor]]. That portion of the tree also cannot be climbed on.

**Located near the tree. Just like the memories of the Dragon [[Azhdaha]] it mentions, the text on it is much eroded. The script used appears to be that commonly used for official and magickal inscriptions in Teyvat (see [[Languages]])

===Etymology===
* In the Chinese mythology, the {{Lang|''Nántiānmén''|zh=南天门|zh_tl=Southern Heavenly Gate}} refers to the main gate of the {{w|Jade Emperor}}'s palace. The gate is considered to be a boundary between the mortal realm and the heavenly realm.
* In the real world, it also refers to a sacred gate of {{w|Mount Tai}} (Taishan), one of the five holiest mountains of China, which was first constructed in 1264 by the Taoist monk Zhang Zhichun.
