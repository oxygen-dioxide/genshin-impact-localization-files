'''Echoes of an Offering''' is an [[Artifact Set]] in [[Version 2.6]]. This may be obtained from the Domain [[The Lost Valley]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* 4-piece set bonus:
** Valley Rite is an [[Additive Base DMG Bonus]].
** Valley Rite is ping dependent, with higher ping (usually over 100) making it inconsistent.
** Valley Rite's odds can still increase even if the wearer's Normal Attacks deal no damage.<ref name=KQM>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/equipment/artifacts#echoes-of-an-offering Echoes of an offering]</ref>
** While off-field, Valley Rite can still trigger, but its odds cannot increase.<ref name=KQM/>
