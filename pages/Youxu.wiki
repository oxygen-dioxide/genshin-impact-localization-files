{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Youxu:''' This is the all-important Golden House. Please tread lightly here, or you'll make me nervous.
:{{DIcon}} Who might you be?
::'''Youxu:''' I'm Youxu of the Millelith, and thus far, nothing untoward has happened on my watch.
::'''Youxu:''' If you go to [[Yujing Terrace]], you'll find my older brother Fengyan on patrol there.
::'''Youxu:''' He's the current Millelith instructor, and is an example to me. Still, I believe that his position will be mine someday soon. *chuckles*
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Golden House.
:;(Before completing "[[Turning Point]]")
::'''Youxu:''' This is where an entire continent's worth of coins are minted. To say that it is the most important place in Liyue is no overstatement.
::'''Youxu:''' As a citizen of Liyue, I pray that this place will remain forever safe. But as a Millelith...
::'''Youxu:''' I wish that it would allow me to do something big. I'd like to believe that some foolhardy fellows out here have designs on this place.
:;(After completing "Turning Point")
::'''Youxu:''' *sigh* I'm still frustrated... When the adepti paid us a visit, our forces were mustered and redeployed throughout the city to strengthen the guard...
::'''Youxu:''' We only found out later via reports that the Golden House had been attacked. I knew that such a day would come.
::'''Youxu:''' I was just following orders, so I wasn't blamed, but... but, this was an opportunity of a lifetime, and I let it slip away just like that...
::'''Youxu:''' Now it feels like I've been guarding this place for this long, but all for naught... With my skills, I could surely have stopped the person who broke in.
::'''Youxu:''' Hmm, you look skeptical. Don't you believe me?
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Youxu:''' While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
