==Summary==
;The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival

Returning to the Grand Bazaar, [[Paimon]] greets [[Dunyarzad]], who asks them how their trip to [[Port Ormos]] went. The Traveler tells them that they did not get any useful information about [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] and remarks on joining them in the future, causing [[Dehya]] to appear and scold her for the thought. Dunyarzad asks Dehya to relax for the day, who agrees since she'll be on the lookout for suspicious people during the festival.

Paimon yawns, so Dunyarzad provides them with some accommodation for the night. The following day, they catch up to her, where she expresses excitement over the [[Sabzeruz Festival]], having been unable to sleep enough for the day. They walk around the stalls to support the merchants, who had come to support the festival out of the blue and without regard to profit. After visiting a candy stall, Dunyarzad decides to return to the lodging as she forgot something, but they soon run into an Eremite brigade intent on capturing her. However, Dehya arrives and insists on taking the group alone, so the two flee to safety.

After getting some distance, Dehya returns, having routed the enemy brigade but Dunyarzad notices that she's injured, which Dehya mentions was as a result of not getting used to her new greatsword. Dunyarzad then realizes that the anonymous donation was actually from Dehya. After Dunyarzard begins to show signs of fatigue, Dehya orders the Traveler to bring her somewhere safe while she patrols the area to ensure no one else was following them.

At another area, Dunyarzad reveals to the Traveler and Paimon that she is afflicted with [[Eleazar]] and has lived with it for so long that her death seems inevitable; as such, she was doing everything to make an impact and be remembered for something. She then remembers the dance and the three race to the bazaar, only to find Nilou being scolded by [[Azar]] and [[Setaria]]. Dunyarzad is surprised to see Azar in-person and attempts to intervene, but the Traveler stops her as the Akademiya has too much power. Azar demands that the stage be dismantled before expressing an intent to decree the prohibiting of public art performances through the Akasha. With no choice, the festival ends early, although Nilou promises to make a better festival the following year. As Paimon laments how the festival ended early, a beeping sound is heard with an unknown voice stating that the project has just begun.

;The Arrival of the Sabzeruz Festival

The festival repeats again, however, the Traveler feels as if something is off. At the candy stall, the Traveler takes their leave and heads to Lambad Tavern and orders some Coconut Charcoal Cakes and eats them, recalling the taste. Paimon realizes that something is off too and they attempt to try something else, only to notice Dunyarzad sitting at the bench. They then witness Azar and Setaria scolding Nilou; with nothing discovered, they sleep again and the same beep starts again. This time, the voice notices a variation in the data and orders someone or something to monitor what's causing it.

;The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival

As the festival loops again, the Traveler guesses all the candies in the boxes before spotting [[Nahida|a strange girl]] and chases after her. After stopping at the [[Bimarstan]] hospital, the girl shows a Canned Knowledge and has both the Traveler and Paimon use it, causing them to realize that they've been stuck in a one-day samsara for several days now. The Dunyarzad that appeared on the cot is the actual one and is deathly ill. The girl introduces herself as Nahida and states that she's trying her best to save her, but they don't have a lot of time and tells them to find as much information as possible before the day ends.

The two try to ask the same people if they felt anything strange, but then decide to go to Dehya. After revealing that they knew about the kidnappers and Dehya selling her greatsword, they take her to Nahida. However, she fails to see Nahida, who tells the two that only they can see her. However, Dehya suddenly senses Dunyarzad's aura, feeling her regret and disappointment, so the Traveler begins to explain what was happening. Dehya agrees with their logic, believing that the sages were probably responsible for the samsara. Nahida then tells them that the Akasha uses the Gnosis to operate and that it gathers and compiles knowledge to the people; upon mentioning this, Dehya is confused as to what compiling meant.

The Traveler concludes that the Akasha is causing mental fatigue, in which Dehya notes that her head feels heavier than usual and wonders if the Akasha is harvesting information from them. Everyone takes their terminals off, but the beeping sound is heard again and the next day begins. The Traveler and Paimon remember everything this time and are met by Nahida. After running the entire day again, the Traveler and Paimon notice that Dehya wasn't injured fighting the kidnappers. When asking her if something felt off, she felt as if she knew how to use her greatsword despite not remembering it, making the two hopeful that something might have changed.

Returning to Nahida, she tells them to wait the next day.

;The Causality of the Sabzeruz Festival

The following day, they return to Dehya, who finds their theory of having their memories erased absurd. As proof of her own evidence, she shows them a training dummy, stating that the sages would have no way to reproduce her swordsmanship for each loop. They then realize that they haven't left the city and decide to do so, reporting back to Nahida, who told them that they already did it twice, so they wait the next day.

;The Empty Illusions of the Sabzeruz Festival

Carrying out the plan, Paimon tells them what happened in the two days they left; they seemingly never returned and the Traveler reported that they couldn't go back and that the festival was one of many spaces. Realizing they need more information, they ask Nahida to create a device, who does so and such records the messages. The Traveler then realizes the truth of the Akasha and the sages are actually stealing dreams from the people of Sumeru. They also realize that Nahida is actually Lesser Lord Kusanali, the Dendro Archon they're looking for. After finishing up questions regarding the dreamscape, the beep rings and they wait the next day.

;The End of the Sabzeruz Festival

The next day, Nahida disappointingly informs them that Dunyarzad's consciousness disappeared, as it could no longer handle the Akasha harvesting. The Traveler and Paimon are also saddened by her apparent demise, but Nahida tells them how to break the samsara; by making the host of the samsara realize they're dreaming. They first decide to go to [[Vihar]], but discover that he isn't the host. After hearing Dehya yelling in the distance, the Traveler goes to her to help against the Eremites, even though Dehya handled them herself in the previous cycles.

Ordering Dehya to leave, the Traveler takes their anger over Dunyarzad's fate on the Eremites before deciding to investigate what Dunyarzad had forgotten. However, feeling it would be rude to just enter without permission, Paimon notices an open window and flies inside, returning with a diary containing her thoughts on the two. Running off to the puppet Dunyarzad, they thank it before sitting down on the nearby bench. They then decide to watch the Dance of Sabzeruz and find Azar and Setaria scolding Nilou. However, the Traveler bumps in, causing them to freeze, confirming their suspicions that they were actually puppets.

Nilou is surprised by the Traveler's intervention before realizing the flowers at the back are actual [[Padisarah]]s, causing them to realize that Nilou is actually the host of the dream, since genuine Padisarahs have been long extinct. As Paimon wonders how to break her out of the dream, Nilou realizes that she's dreaming and explains about the tale of the First Sage. Now realizing she's in a dream, Nilou decides to perform the dance as the dreamscape dissolves, during which the two also see Dunyarzad's spirit. Waking up, they run back to where they met Nahida, finding Dunyarzad back in-person and Katheryne next to her.

;Dawn

Talking to "Katheryne", they realize that it is just Nahida possessing her. She suggests speaking elsewhere and they stop by the same bench, where Nahida reveals she left the city in the last cycle and found a fragment of Dunyarzhad's consciousness, which she was barely able to sustain until the samsara broke. However, she is significantly tired from doing so, but tells the two that the Akasha would be unable to host an event of such size for some time. She plans to investigate what caused the sages to step out of line before leaving to rest. As she leaves, Katheryne comes back to her own senses and asks the two what happened.

==Trivia==
*In Part 2: [[The Arrival of the Sabzeruz Festival]], Dehya's left arm temporarily has a bandage wrapped around it after receiving an injury as a consequence of her battle with Eremite mercenaries, and loses it in Part 4: [[The Samsara of the Sabzeruz Festival]]. These are some of the few instances a character model changes in-game.
