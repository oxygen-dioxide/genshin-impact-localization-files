{{Location Intro|'''Mona's Laboratory'''|description=<p>{{If Self|Mona's Laboratory|It|Mona's Laboratory}} can be found at the southern end of the [[City of Mondstadt]], a bit beyond [[Schulz's Blacksmith]]. The door is originally blocked by a {{Hydro}} seal placed over it before the completion of {{Quest|Beyond This World's Stars}}.</p>}}

==Dialogue==
Before the completion of ''Beyond This World's Stars'', interacting with the door leads to the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue Start}}
: '''Examine the door:''' (This door seems to be locked by a curious seal. I wonder whose place this is?)
{{Dialogue End}}

==Lore==
During ''Beyond This World's Stars'', [[Goth]] reveals that it is one of his properties, but someone placed a Hydro seal over it and he could not lease it. [[Mona]] eventually broke the seal and moved in after Goth rents it to her at the lowest possible price. The player is able to interact with Mona through the door, but the house will no longer be interactable after the quest ends and the player leaves the area. 

The house is interactable once more during the {{Quest|Owe Mora, Pay Mora}}. The interior of the house is seen during the {{Quest|The Ancient Azure Stars}}.
