|description     = A steaming-hot noodle dish.
|desc_suspicious = The noodles were all but forgotten amid the hubbub of preparing the accoutrements, leading to it almost turning into a paste and becoming one with the soup. Oh well, at least you can drink the whole lot to salvage it a bit.
|desc_basic      = The meat, prepared at low temperature, is laid over the noodles. Salty, fragrant, delicious soup seeps into each strand. A single bowl of these is guaranteed to restore any tired soul.
|desc_delicious  = The springy noodles have absorbed the essence of the soup, and the accoutrements have added all manner of variation to the mouthfeel. The soup has preserved the strong fragrance of the bones used to make it, yet goes down gently without that greasy feeling. Before you know it, the bowl's all gone, and you've still got room for more.

'''Tonkotsu Ramen''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The [[recipe]] for Tonkotsu Ramen is available from [[Shimura Kanbei]] at [[Shimura's]] in [[Inazuma City]] for 5,500 [[Mora]].

Depending on the quality, Tonkotsu Ramen restores '''30'''/'''32'''/'''34'''% of Max HP and an additional '''600'''/'''1,250'''/'''1,900''' HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

When [[Gorou]] cooks Tonkotsu Ramen, there is a chance [[Victorious Legend]] will be created instead.

==Trivia==
*{{w|Tonkotsu ramen|Tonkotsu Ramen}} is a type of ramen noodle dishes, whose soup broth is based on {{Lang|pork bones|ja=豚骨|ja_rm=tonkotsu}}. The reason this dish was chosen to appear in the game among various kinds of ramen is likely because it is the most popular Japanese ramen dish in Mainland China.
*Although the English text specifically uses the term ''tonkotsu'' which means pork bones, both the Chinese and Japanese versions refer to this dish just as "Beast-Bone Ramen" ({{Lang|Shòugǔ Lāmiàn|zh=兽骨拉面}} and {{Lang|Juukotsu Raamen|ja=獣骨ラーメン}}).
