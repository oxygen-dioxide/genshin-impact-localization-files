==Description==
{{Description|A clear and clean azure flower, it is born where Water Veins come together. It has a simple, cool, and elegant fragrance, pungent and refreshing yet gentle.<br>In the language of flowers, it means "waiting" and "everlasting promise."<br>In ancient legends, the [[Egeria|Mistress of Many Waters]] gave a flower as pure as Lakelight to the last Lochknight as a farewell gift. To this day, Fontaine maintains the tradition of picking a Lily and giving it to those on long journeys, wishing one another a road ahead as tranquil as pure water, and that those most precious will be able to follow its cool light, returning to their side.|[[Archive]]}}
