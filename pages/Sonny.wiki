==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sonny:''' ...You're right, dear Luca. I do hope that such a regrettable incident won't happen again.
:'''Luca:''' ...
:'''Sonny:''' Why, if it isn't our old friend! What a coincidence, bumping into you! How have you been?
:{{DIcon|Reward}} About [[Virgil]]...
::'''Sonny:''' Right, are you interested in fishing? In Fontaine, there are all sorts of fish that make fishing truly rewarding. Am I right, my dear Luca?
::'''Luca:''' ...
::'''Sonny:''' *sigh* Shame, he seems to have his own more... tedious pursuits. Still, I am certain that you understand. Am I right, my dear {{Traveler}}?
::'''Sonny:''' Here's some fresh catch. Please take it. I am sorry to interrupt you, it's just that I really wanted to share this... novel fun of exercising with you.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fish|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} How've been things for you?
::'''Sonny:''' I hope you're right! While there's always something unpleasant to deal with, as we say in Fontaine, "that's life."
::'''Sonny:''' Don't you think so, dear Luca?
::'''Luca:''' Life? Hmph!
::'''Sonny:''' You see? Luca's wit is as electrifying as ever. I'm overjoyed to hear him answer your question so concisely.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sonny:''' Truly, this was a wonderful encounter for a beautiful day. Goodbye, dear friend.
::'''Luca:''' See you.
