{{Description|An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br />This cat is intelligent and combative, and has quite the aura of prestige to it. These cats are excellent at earning the favor of humans, and it is often able to get the upper hand over its kin when it comes to gathering food. As such, they tend to get fat quite quickly, though this does not diminish their cuteness in human eyes at all.|[[Archive]] Description}}

'''Jade-Eyed Cat''' is a type of cat. It can be found both as [[Wildlife]] and as a pet for the [[Serenitea Pot]] which can be brought from [[Chubby]].

Cats cannot be killed and are passive towards the player. Attacking one will make it fling backwards, and some [[Elemental Skill]]s can make it run away and disappear. Approaching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[Archive]].

In the Serenitea Pot, cats behave like it does in the open world with the only exception of it being able to disappear.

Common animals can be placed in indoor and outdoor spaces within the Serenitea Pot.
