|text    = Ho, comrade! Travels going smoothly? Nothing major tripping you up in life?

I have been swamped recently, so busy that I haven't even had time to cook a proper meal! My cooking skills are going to get rusty at this rate... Of course, there's no way I could tell [[Tonia]] about any of that in my letters.

Next, I have to go run a little errand for the [[Northland Bank]], so I've gotta move fast and use the few days before I set out for some "special training."

I've got it! Since you've been all over the world, you've probably collected all kinds of ingredients, right? How about giving me a little test? You pick the ingredients and seasonings, and I turn them into a scrumptious delight. You know me, I never back down from a challenge! Don't you dare go easy on me, comrade!
