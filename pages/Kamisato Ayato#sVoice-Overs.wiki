After that, she would start focusing intensely every time she heard the sound of thunder, as if by concentrating hard enough, she'd be able to hear exactly what Her Excellency was saying.

|vo_06_02_tx         = Trusting another person isn't easy, especially for someone of high status. Place your trust in the wrong person, and it can quite literally cost you your life. But you have placed your trust in me, and of course I will not let you down.

<!-- Misc I -->|vo_07_01_title          = About the [[Vision]]
|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = A Vision is an eminently useful tool, so it only makes sense to put it to good use. Also, I like to think it's happiest in my possession because it has the chance to shine away in all its glory.
|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = If you throw fallen flowers onto the stove, the searing heat infuses them with one final spark of vitality, and for a brief moment, they radiate a more glorious glow than the flames themselves... it was a short life they lived, but it was by no means a wasted one.

|vo_07_03_tx         = When it comes to pets... Mm, yes, I'm definitely more of a dog person myself. Cats are very independent, which has its merits, but you'll only find obedience in dogs. They'll do whatever you tell them to. Hehe, what can I say &mdash; I suppose I find loyalty to be quite an attractive quality.

|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = I am confident in Ayaka's abilities. But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little more quickly than I'd intended.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Kamisato Ayaka

|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Thoma.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = There is no doubt in my mind about Thoma's loyalty to the Kamisato Clan. A long time ago, partly to see where he stood, I advised him that he would be better off leaving if he didn't want to get drawn into the never-ending disputes that plague public life. Still, he chose to stay, and in all the time he's been with us, he's spared me much worry. There are very few people I trust completely these days, but Thoma is one of them.

|vo_08_03_tx         = She looks awfully idle the majority of the time, and yet when it counts, she always rises to the occasion and provides indispensable assistance. Of course, you'd know far more about that than me, wouldn't you?
|vo_08_03_mention    = Sayu

|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Yoimiya.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Ah, the fireworks store owner. Yes, a most... spirited young lady. The Kamisato Clan is on rather close terms with her. She is around the same age as Ayaka, and the two get along very well. I trust her direct and outspoken disposition won't lead Ayaka astray. Ayaka has always been staunchly true to herself, ever since she was a young child.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Yoimiya,Kamisato Ayaka
|vo_08_05_title      = About the [[Raiden Shogun]]

|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Raiden Shogun.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = The cost of pursuing eternity has been great for the Almighty Shogun... and for all of Inazuma. These wounds will take time to heal, and as someone with a mediating role to play in the political process, I will be sure to fulfill that which is required of me.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Raiden Shogun
|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Yae Miko]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Yae Miko.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = Lady Guuji has been kind to us in the Kamisato Clan, but she has never quite taken to me personally. I trust you'll have heard the way she refers to me... "the Yashiro rascal" and other such flattering monikers. We run into each other semi-regularly, given the overlap in our work, and despite whatever private thoughts we each may have, our working relationship is quite a harmonious one. I have no great objection to this state of affairs &mdash; working with intelligent people always makes things highly efficient. In any case... However objectionable she might find me, she would be forced to admit that without me, she would have no one to help execute her weird and wonderful ideas.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Yae Miko
|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Kujou Sara]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kujou Sara.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = Old man Kujou capitalized on a golden opportunity to create a most formidable weapon indeed. The only flaw in his plan being, he is now no longer able to wield the weapon of his creation.

|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kaedehara Kazuha.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = Once upon a time, the [[Kaedehara Clan]] was a subordinate branch of the Kamisato Clan. My forebears may have failed to save his family from decline, but even today I have a duty to support him. Now, naturally, there is nothing I can do to restore his clan's former fortunes. But as for helping him avoid arrest by the Tenryou Commission, that is well within my capabilities...

|vo_08_09_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Arataki Itto.ogg
|vo_08_09_tx         = Now he's an interesting case. The idea of pitting docile [[Onikabuto]] against each other in battle, I mean really... I was only speaking in polite platitudes when I gave him that little pep talk, but to my surprise he started calling me "bro"... To this day, he calls me "my bro Ayato" without the faintest idea of my true identity. It's quite alright by me, though, I have nothing against his... eccentricities.
|vo_08_09_mention    = Arataki Itto

|vo_08_10_friendship = 4
|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Ningguang.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = I have heard a thing or two about how Her Eminence, the [[Tianquan]] operates. On the subject, I also happen to have a limited-edition copy of Liyue Millennial, if you're interested? What do you say, shall I have someone fetch it, so we can play a game?

|vo_09_01_tx         = You want to know about me? Hmm. Things aren't always a case of the more you know, the better. Plenty of proverbs to corroborate that, as I'm sure you're aware. (Smile) Maybe we'll have the chance to talk more next time.

Let me be quite clear: Most of the time, I simply enjoy watching people's facial contortions when they're put in an awkward position. Watching them squirm, you might say. Is that so strange? I would have thought you tease your little friend here on a regular basis for precisely that purpose, no?

There is no pleasure to be had in mixing with the powers that be. I shall spare you the details. Just know that... I have never done anything to dishonor the Kamisato Clan.

It's a secret unit that reports directly to the head of the Kamisato Clan. Accordingly, after my father passed, it came to me. There are certain situations I cannot directly involve myself in, and in these cases, being able to rely on the Shuumatsuban is often instrumental in achieving a resolution. Most of its members are orphans whom we take in and raise from a young age. This way, loyalty is guaranteed to the greatest extent possible, and we are spared a great deal of worry.

But anyway, I've shared enough of my secrets. I think it's time I heard your story. Oh, and... you can spare the part about traveling in Teyvat. Tell me about before that.
