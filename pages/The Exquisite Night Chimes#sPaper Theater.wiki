{{Description|A man's melancholic yearning, adepti and demons, and a heartfelt romance played out with paper.}}
'''Paper Theater''' is a subevent during [[The Exquisite Night Chimes]].

==Tutorial==
{{Tutorial
|image1  = Tutorial Paper Theater 1.png
|text1   = After the performance begins, the actor named "Huanguang" will move at a fixed speed across the stage, and will change directions upon making contact with the paper theater's edge or any obstacles.
|image2  = Tutorial Paper Theater 2.png
|text2   = Traps will appear to impede the journey of "Huanguang." Touching them will cause the performance to fail. Move the stage sections to change his path and avoid traps such that he can reach his destination.
|image3  = Tutorial Paper Theater 3.png
|text3   = "Huanguang" can leap from an upper level of the stage to a lower level via gaps, but if he falls through a gap on the lower level of the stage, he will fall off the stage, which will result in a performance failure.
|image4  = Tutorial Paper Theater 4.png
|text4   = "Huanguang" has the protection of the adeptus and can ride on the wind. When he reaches a place where the wind rises, he can ride its flow and reach the stage's upper level.
|image5  = Tutorial Paper Theater 5.png
|text5   = Certain gaps on the stage come equipped with extra boards. Use the mechanisms on the floor to control whether a gap is open or closed. "Huanguang" can switch the state of stage gaps once for each time he steps on such devices.
|image6  = Tutorial Paper Theater 6.png
|text6   = To open the locked door, you must first obtain the key to it.
|image7  = Tutorial Paper Theater 7.png
|text7   = Some locked stage sections can be unlocked using keys.
