==Summary==
;Natlan! A New Adventure

Arriving at [[Romaritime Harbor]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] discuss heading to [[Natlan]]. Paimon remarks that they hadn't seen a single human from Natlan despite having done so from Inazuma, and thus worries if Natlan no longer has a human population. Suddenly, [[Charlotte]] appears and takes a photo of them, having heard that they were about to depart. [[Navia]], [[Clorinde]], and [[Furina]] also arrive to bid farewell to the Traveler and hoping that their journey in Natlan would be uneventful. After the photo shoot, the Traveler and Paimon depart for Natlan.

At Natlan, Paimon remarks about the landscape and the many animals roaming the plains. The Traveler notices signs of human habitation and follows the road, hoping that they would encounter someone from Natlan and hopefully their Archon. When they come upon [["Children of Echoes"|a village]], they find two adults talking to a child, who tell her they were leaving her team for the upcoming [[Pilgrimage]]. The girl, [[Kachina]], is upset, but allows them to go. The Traveler and Paimon then approach her and offer to help, though Kachina tells them that the Pilgrimage was only for natives of Natlan. However, seeing that they're stronger than they appear, she asks to learn from them so she can prepare herself while also offering to guide them around her village, which they accept.

On the way, they pass by a stage where several tribespeople are dancing, and Kachina explains how her people can align themselves to a rhythm. Later on, they run into her [[Saurian]] companion, [[Ayo]], and Kachina explains the relationship between her tribe, the [[Children of Echoes]], and the [[Tepetlisaurus]], their Saurian companions. Further down, they come across a large black stone, which symbolizes the tribe's [[Wayob]] before chief [[Pacal]] approaches Kachina, surprised to see her there. Kachina introduces the pair as adventurers who are going to teach her a few things, causing Pacal to ask them to prove their identities; Kachina objects to this, but the Traveler understands that as she is a minor, he is only looking out for Kachina's safety. On Paimon's suggestion, the Traveler offers their handbook to look over which Pacal reluctantly accepts as he views the [[Adventurers' Guild]] as a "mixed bag". However, upon reading their names it's revealed that news of the Traveler and Paimon has reached Natlan and he's heard all about them. He apologizes for his mistrust and advises Kachina to learn well from them. Paimon then asks about the Wayob, and he explains that the Wayob determines who is worthy of inheriting the [[Ancient Name]], which is a sign of pride. Kachina is unsure as to why the Wayob had picked her as an Ancient Name bearer, but Pacal tells her to look toward the future.

With the registration for the Pilgrimage coming to an end soon, Kachina decides to head to the venue to register and tells them that they can expect the [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]] to be there in person. They stop by the local [[Statue of The Seven]], and the Traveler attempts to resonate with the statue to gain the power of [[Pyro]]. However, to their surprise, the Traveler fails to resonate with the statue. Nonetheless, they show several of their elemental powers to Kachina, who is amazed that a person is able to use multiple elements at once. Walking further down the road, Kachina decides a break is in order and explains that the Pyro Archon is actually a human, much to the Traveler and Paimon's surprise. Kachina then notices a [[Phlogiston]] Chisel and states that only people from Natlan could use it, but the Traveler activates it, much to her surprise. A large Saruian then appears, who Kachina recognizes as Toto. Toto lowers its head down, which Kachina explains is an invitation to ride on it, though she decides to stop right outside the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame|city]] to avoid tiring Toto.

A short walk later, the three arrive at the outskirts of the city when [[K'uhul Ajaw]] appears and begins scolding Kachina for being late and wasting his, [[Kinich]]'s, and [[Mualani]]'s time. Kinich and Mualani appear, the former forcing Ajaw into timeout while the latter asks Kachina where her teammates are. Upon learning that she was ditched again, he remarks that a strong team or team leader for the ''team'' stage won't matter when it comes down to individual strength in the end. Mualani points out that Kachina was very close to participating in the "[[Night Warden Wars]]" last time, and Kinich explains that the Pilgrimage is actually a test to see who is worthy to fight against the [[Abyss]] and defend their homeland. For this iteration of the Pilgrimage, five people will be able to earn that honor. Since Kachina no longer has teammates to help her, Mualani decides to ask if the Traveler and Paimon can join the Pilgrimage under special circumstances. However, she doubts it would be allowed, in which case she will instead pair up with Kachina while Kinich will step in to lead her former team.

While waiting for Mualani to break the news to her former teammates, the rest head to the registration site where Paimon notices several flags hanging, which are explained to represent the six tribes of Natlan. Kinich tells them that he is a member of the [[Scions of the Canopy]] and that his people are close to the [[Yumkasaurus]]. Kachina explains that Mualani hails from the [[People of the Springs]], a seaside tribe, and that the other three tribes are the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], the [[Flower-Feather Clan]], and the [[Collective of Plenty]]. Mualani returns and formally greets the Traveler on behalf of her people before they head to the registration site, where Mualani asks [[Cival]] if she could make an exception by allowing the Traveler to register for the Pilgrimage. Cival declines, stating that it would jeopardize the production of Contending Fire--only produced in battles between Natlanese--which is the fuel for the [[Sacred Flame]] that keeps the Abyss from invading Natlan.

Kinich further explains that only those bestowed with Ancient Names are sent to fight the Abyss, though non-name bearers who emerge victorious in the Pilgrimage will are still treated with the same honor as an Ancient Name bearer. The [[Ode of Resurrection]] only works on those with Ancient Names, and the Pilgrimage is meant to instill teamwork, as they have to emerge victorious against the Abyss, or they will die and their Ancient Name will be forsaken and forgotten. He also remarks that he has fallen several times and was brought to the realm of the Wayob, or the "[[Night Kingdom]]." Cival finishes registration and sets the teams, telling them that food and lodging is prepared for them. Mualani tells the Traveler and Paimon that everything was given courtesy of the Pyro Archon, and that friends and family can also benefit from it. They head to the [[Weary Inn]] for dinner, where they treat themselves to local specialties. Kachina is still nervous about the upcoming Pilgrimage, though Mualani and the Traveler cheer her back up. While she heads out to get some homemade fruit juice, Kinich tells the Traveler that Mualani is a three-time veteran of the Night Warden Wars and has never had to be resurrected. Mualani tells him that she hopes to share the victory with Kachina this time and boost her mood.

;Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame

The next day, the group prepares to participate in the Pilgrimage while the Traveler and Paimon join the spectators in the stands. The first part of the Pilgrimage begins, with teams launched in hot air ballons to random locations and tasked with collecting Contending Sparks within a time limit. Kachina and Mualani work together to defeat some of the competition, allowing them to clear the stage. Mualani and Kachina are then separated for the one-on-one matches and placed in different lounges. During this time, two disqualified contestants, [[Tepexpan]] and [[Tamuin]], attempt to threaten Kachina, believing she and Mualani had acted unfairly by catching them off-guard and defeating them in the team stage. The Traveler intervenes, and Kachina is reassured by the tournament staff that a loss is a loss, and that she should focus on her current matches. After a short break, she heads to the stadium, where she faces [[Nkunga]] and defeats him, determined to participate in the Night Warden Wars. After a few more fights, she faces [[Liliuo]]. While she puts up a greater fight compared to Nkunga, Kachina defeats her, and Liliuo apologizes for taunting her earlier, acknowledging her strength.

Back at the lounge, Kachina thanks the Traveler and Paimon for their cheers as Mualani comes in, revealing that as they're very close in the rankings, she's her final opponent for the elimination round. Kachina is upset that she has to fight her friend, but Mualani accepts whatever outcome happens. Kachina prepares herself and heads back out to the arena. While she's still nervous, Mualani reassures her and they fight. Kachina comes out victorious with a surprise attack, and the resulting victory allows her to participate in the Night Warden Wars alongside [[Chasca]], [[Iansan]], [[Kaiulani]], and [[Kibangu]].

While Kachina and the others head to fight the Abyss, Mualani decides to show the Traveler around Natlan just before Kinich arrives with the same idea. Since Mualani asked first, he relents and allows her to take them to [["People of the Springs"|her village]].
----
;Home of the Hot Springs

The three arrive at Mualani's village and she prepares to send them to the hot springs, but they are stopped by [[Atea]], who reminds her about the unwritten rule: outsiders must first acclimate themselves in the artificial springs before using the natural ones, to avoid scalds and burns. Mualani reveals that while Atea is a good friend of hers, she could not enjoy hot springs anymore after being impaled by an Abyssal monster. They later meet up with the chief [[Amina]] and her guards, who were secretly organizing a party for Atea after witnessing her enter an abandoned hot spring. After a short soak in the artificial springs, served by Atea with snacks, they check on the party progress. Unfortunately, little was made, so Mualani brings the Traveler with her to show her around the village while also getting the necessary items to set up the venue. The setup takes longer than they anticipated, and they learn Atea volunteered for night patrol that night, so the party gets put off until the next day.

Mualani brings the Traveler and Paimon to the inn, where they resign themselves to a night of sleep. However, they are jolted awake when they hear cries in the middle of the night; the Abyss has emerged to attack the village, consisting of a few [[Riftwolf|riftwolf whelps]] and Abyssal manifestations of Saurians. Defeating the few stragglers that entered the village, Mualani decides to talk to Amina to get a grasp of the situation. Amina tells them that they have confirmed one pylon in the area, but there could be more. Mualani and the Traveler head to the known pylon and destroy it, and the Traveler notices more monsters coming from a specific direction, which Mualani recognizes as the abandoned spring area. They head to the area to clear the pylon, only to find that Atea already destroyed it, albeit at the cost of sustaining severe injuries. As a doctor is called for, the Traveler realizes that she won't live that long and recalls the time they purified [[Dvalin]]'s tears when they were in [[Mondstadt]]. The Traveler uses their purification powers on Atea's wounds to cleanse the Abyssal energy. This removes the mark from Atea, though the Traveler discovers that the old Abyssal contamination is too deep-rooted within her organs. They realize that she had been visiting the abandoned spring not because she had gotten better, but because she knew that her end was near, and they're unsure if they should inform Mualani of this revelation.

The next day, the party commences, but Atea is initially nowhere to be seen. She arrives a bit later and thanks the Traveler for their actions, though their silence confirms to her that they know she doesn't have much time left. She calls out to Mualani and has her and the Traveler come with her for a walk, where she reveals that she only has a few days left until her death. However, seeing Mualani in action reassured her that the tribe will be in good hands. She also hands the Traveler her [[Atea's Talisman|talisman]], asking that it be given to the Pyro Archon when they meet again.
