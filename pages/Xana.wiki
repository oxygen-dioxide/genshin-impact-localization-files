{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xana:''' If you've got shiny stuff, come exchange them with Xana!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} And what can we exchange them for?
::'''Xana:''' Well, all this stuff here! If you see anything you like, just tell me!
:;(Opens Strange Part exchange shop.)
:{{DIcon}} Shiny stuff?
::'''Xana:''' That's right. Shiny components just like this one!
::'''Xana:''' As long as we've got enough of them, we might be able to create a super giant mega machine, one even larger than [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]]. Ooh, just thinking about it gets me all excited!
::'''Xana:''' Sometimes, I'd go out of the village to collect little things that aren't shiny yet, and I would find ways to make them shiny!
::'''Xana:''' Whatever the case, the more shiny stuff, the better! Like I said, if you've got some, you can exchange them here at Xana's!
:{{DIcon}} Huh, I haven't seen you around before...
::'''Xana:''' Hmm? Oh, if you're talking about where I was then, I was at the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] &mdash; there's nowhere better to go if you want to learn how to make awesome clockwork meka!
::'''Xana:''' There's a super cool, super huge machine there too... but one day, I will make something larger still!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Xana:''' See you. Remember to come by again!
