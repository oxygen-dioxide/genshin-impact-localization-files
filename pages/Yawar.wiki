==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yawar:''' Those who stand at high places are always staring at their feet, so they can easily overlook dangers coming from above. They should be more careful...
:{{DIcon}} Is this area especially prone to accidents?
::'''Yawar:''' That's exactly right.
::'''Yawar:''' See the cliffs around here? There are basically no fences in sight.
::'''Yawar:''' My people are at least used to it &mdash; we've all gotten picked up by [[Yumkasaurus|Yumkasaurs]] at some point in our lives.
::'''Yawar:''' So if you were to hear someone suddenly miss their step and start screaming, chances are they're an outlander friend.
::{{DIcon}} Is injury likely?
::'''Yawar:''' Usually, it'd just be some small scratches.
::'''Yawar:''' The ones who get seriously hurt around here are those who are into serious challenges and extreme sports.
::'''Yawar:''' Oh, and just between the two of us, if you ever find someone seriously injured but without the help of a doctor, please feel free to bring them to me.
::'''Yawar:''' I actually know some first aid techniques, but please don't tell anyone else about it!
::'''Yawar:''' If those crazy kids ever hear that I'd be able to save them, they'll just feel compelled to try even more dangerous tricks.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the reminder.
::'''Yawar:''' You're welcome.
