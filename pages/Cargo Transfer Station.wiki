|description    = A transit point for moving goods from place to place. Beside the piled-high cargo crates and wooden barrels are drinks prepared for the workers.<br>Though common bottles and jugs are quite sturdy nowadays, they will still break easily if squashed under a very heavy object. Thus, the workers have always hoped that their foreman might get a cupboard of some sort, rather than leave the bottles on the ground.
