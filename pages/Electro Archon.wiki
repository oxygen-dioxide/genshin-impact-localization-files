The '''Electro Archon''', also referred to as the '''Great Narukami''', is the [[Archon]] who presides over [[Inazuma]], the land of [[Electro]]. There have been two holders of this title:
#[[Makoto]], the first Electro Archon who perished during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago
#[[Ei]], Makoto's twin sister and successor to the Electro Archon title, although this is not known to the public
#*[[The Shogun]] was created in the Raiden twins' image and now serves as the public image for the Electro Archon

Because Ei served as Makoto's ''kagemusha'', or body double, while Makoto was alive, most people in Inazuma are unaware that the Electro Archon had a twin sister, that the original Archon died and was succeeded by said twin, or that the current embodiment of the Electro Archon is an artificial entity made in their images. As a result, some dialogue and texts that refer to the "Electro Archon" or the "Narukami" may not be specifying one of the three and instead refer to the overarching concept of Inazuma's god.
