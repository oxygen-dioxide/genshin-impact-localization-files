[[Version 2.8]]
* Specters received the following changes:
** Max [[HP]] was reduced by 20%.
** [[ATK]] [[Level Scaling/Enemy|Level Scaling]] was changed from Type 1 to Type 2, resulting in varying degrees of ATK decrease from Level 41 to Level 89.
** [[Interruption Resistance/Poise#Poise Type|Poise Type]] was changed from "Other Grunt" to "Humanoid Grunt", resulting in a decrease in overall Interruption Resistance.
** Updated behavior after being hit and launched.
*** Where they previously would heavily recoil backwards (often so far they would end up out of reach), they now instead spin in place with little to no movement/recoil.
** Removed immunity to [[Vacuum Field]] effects when not inflated.
** Increased the HP percentage of damage required to fill up the [[Fury]] meter.
*** The previous HP percentage thresholds were:<table class="fandom-table"><tr><th>DMG Taken (%Max HP)</th><th>Fury Accumulated (%)</th></tr><tr><td>15-25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>25-35</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>35-45</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>45+</td><td>100</td></tr></table>
