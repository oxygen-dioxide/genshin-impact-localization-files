==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to "Boatman")
:'''"Boatman":''' The near side of the river, hey! The cypress painted silver, hoi! The silver wormwood on the ground, the silver stones lie all around...
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:'''"Boatman":''' Oho, who have we here? Guests? Here to board the boat, perhaps?
:'''"Boatman":''' Ai yai yai, but let's see, now let's see... Oh, you seem like outsiders. That won't do, no, that won't do...
:{{DIcon}} "That won't do"?
:{{DIcon}} What are you talking about?
:'''"Boatman":''' The shining silver skiff sails soft to yonder moon, but it was not prepared for you, oh no! Step not aboard, soil not the decks...
:'''"Boatman":''' Ai yai yai... The fog is long scattered, and long scattered is the fog! Yet who has not boarded? The lady of the golden hall shall be angry. Most angry...
:{{DIcon}} Boat...? Where's the boat?
:'''"Boatman":''' Aha, a-hey... The silver skiff, scion of sun and slope, hey! All must come home, all must return, to the moon-mansion that golden burns...
:'''"Boatman":''' But for shame, for shame! Some children have lost their way, and still they have not boarded! The lady she shall be angry. Oh, most, most angry...
:{{DIcon}} Do you need any help?
:{{DIcon}} Are you listening to me?
:'''"Boatman":''' Come, come, board the boat, the boat it is for boarding! Wander not, be lost no more, for life no longer mourning...

;(Prior to completing all of the Hidden Exploration Objectives)
;(Talk to "Boatman" again)

;(If [[Abe's Fungi Needs]] has not been completed) <!-- I think this is correct -->
:'''"Boatman":''' Ye old who linger on things yet strange and new, let us return, let us return, to the golden halls upon the moon.

;(If [[A Gift To Shitoki, Wrapped In Conches]] has not been completed)
:'''"Boatman":''' The child who picks shells by the shore, come, board the boat! The brother you knew has left his forebears' souls to seek a life on the far shore. Forget him now, forget the pain of parting...

;(If [[Ipe's Fishing Advice]] has not been completed)
:'''"Boatman":''' And you, child lingering by the shore, pray, what more have you lost? Come, now, board quickly now, be not nostalgia-crossed.

;(If [[Lighting Chise's Path]] has not been completed)
:'''"Boatman":''' The silver shining moon, yah-hey, the silver gleaming hearts, yah-ho... Those who guard the foggy plain, fain not in yon misty woods remain. Aye, board the boat, yes, board the boat!

;(If [[Kito and Kina's Request]] has not been completed)
:'''"Boatman":''' I spy the dear little children, who dearly miss their grandmother. A shame yes, a pity indeed, that they cannot board the boat.

;(If [[Nonno's Hide And Seek]] has not been completed)
:'''"Boatman":''' Lost, lonely, little child, are you playing on your own? Come now, come sail away, to a land where none play alone.

;(If [[Rero's Joke]] has not been completed) <!-- I think this is correct -->
:'''"Boatman":''' Ah, there, yes there too indeed. One who has grown too swift and wild, but whose soul is yet that of a child. One playful in a funny way, who forgot to board the boat today...

;(If [[Una's Longing]] has not been completed)
:'''"Boatman":''' Now I spy, with my little eye... A grandmother missing her grandchildren. She cannot put them down, no she cannot, and she cannot board the boat!
----
;(After completing all of the Hidden Exploration Objectives)
;(Talk to "Boatman" again)
:'''"Boatman":''' They have all come, ya-ho, ya-hey, we have our merry cast...
:'''"Boatman":''' Thank you, fair outlander, ho! We set off now at last...
:'''"Boatman":''' The far side of the river, hey! The golden oak is yonder, hoi! The golden wormwood on the ground, the golden stones lie all around...
:'''"Boatman":''' The sights are lovely as can be, much further than the eye can see...

==Trivia==
* The song "Boatman" sings references the Ainu lullaby {{Lang|[https://youtu.be/FSTXj7xs97Y Sixty Cradles]|ain=レ ホッネ シンタ|ain_rm=Re-Hotne Sinta}}, which describes a journey along a river lined with golden and silver forests, ''yomogi'' fields, and stones up to the golden house of a god who births life.
