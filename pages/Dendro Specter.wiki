{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Fury
|desc_1 = Taking high DMG from a single attack will charge Fury. The higher the DMG dealt, the more Fury will be accumulated. When they have a full Fury bar, they will grow bigger and gain access to enhanced attacks. <table class="fandom-table"><tr><th>DMG Taken (%Max HP)</th><th>Fury Accumulated (%)</th></tr><tr><td>18.75–31.25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>31.25–43.75</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>43.75–56.25</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>56.25+</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

|name_2 = Orb Throw
|desc_2 = Lobs an orb of Dendro energy at the player which bursts on contact, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.

|name_3 = Energy Field
|desc_3 = Summons a field of leaves below the player which gradually expands before bursting, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}. If the field hits a target, it will generate an energy orb which fills the Fury of itself by 50%.
|caption_3 = Miss
|file_3_2 = Dendro Specter Energy Field 2
|caption_3_2 = Hit

|name_4 = Spread Spin
|desc_4 = Repeatedly spins to release 3 sprays of leaves around itself, with each spray having a larger radius than the last, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}} with each spray. This attack will only occur at max Fury and will be the only attack it uses in that state.

|name_5 = Final Burst
|desc_5 = Explodes after a short pause when defeated, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}. If at max Fury, DMG is increased to '''150% ATK''' and if other Specters which are not at full Fury are nearby, the explosion will also release energy orbs that track the Specters in question and fill their Fury by 100%.

{{Description|A monster born from high-density Dendro energy that can float in the air.<br>A researcher from [[Vahumana]] once did research into the ecological peculiarities of Dendro Specters, finding them to be quite similar to the legendary "Aranara." His conclusion was that the Aranara were actually Dendro Specters. This researcher would become a little-known writer of fairy tales.|[[Archive]]}}
