{{Lang|'''Bake-danuki'''|ja=妖狸}} are a type of tanuki found in [[Inazuma]]. They have a leaf on their head and a bag around their neck.

Upon spotting a player in the near vicinity, they'll start to dance and make music. When approached they'll disappear and then reappear in a puff of smoke nearby continuing their song. After around 3 or 4 of those "steps" they'll have disguised themselves as some kind of destructible or interactable environmental object (e.g. a small rock stack, vase or brazier, an [[Elemental Monument]], objects which will be highlighted by [[Elemental Sight]]). Upon attempting to break the object, they'll drop their disguise and disappear after which their former location can be [[Investigation|inspected]], dropping one or a few low-grade artifacts. In [[Co-Op Mode]], all players can lead the bake-danuki to the spot where they will disguise themselves and destroy the object. However, the investigation prompt can only be triggered by the host.

Some bake-danukis may "prank" the player by appearing already disguised as a common [[chest]], then revealing themselves and disappearing in a puff of smoke when the player gets close. They leave behind an investigation spot that drops cooking ingredients. One such fake chest can be found along the mountainside path leading to the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]]. These chests can be opened by interacting with it while the bake-danuki is inactive, such as at night, or by being fast enough so the bake-danuki does not reveal itself.

Some groups of puzzles objects already present in the world, such as multiple [[Elemental Monument]]s, may act as normal until completion of the puzzle and then reveal themselves to all be bake-danukis. Chests will still be awarded for completing such puzzles, as if they were normal puzzle objects.

Their leader [[Ioroi]] can be found sealed inside a large statue within [[Chinju Forest]].
