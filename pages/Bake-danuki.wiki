{{Lang|'''Bake-danuki'''|ja=化け狸}}, also known simply as '''tanuki''', are a type of [[youkai]] found in [[Inazuma]]. They resemble small, plump raccoons, and are usually seen with a leaf on their head and a bag tied around their neck.

Their leader, [[Ioroi]], can be found sealed inside a large statue within [[Chinju Forest]].

==Locations==
Bake-Danuki can be found all Inazuman islands except [[Tsurumi Island]].

See the [https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=264 Official Interactive Map] for specific locations.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing Bake-danuki "pranks" 15 times awards the {{Achievement|Yamada Go's Wooden Mallet}}.
* Bake-danuki may "prank" the player in two manners:
** Leading the players while "mocking" them by dancing and teleporting when the player approaches them
*** In [[Co-Op Mode]], all players can lead the bake-danuki to the spot where they will disguise themselves and destroy the object. However, the investigation prompt can only be triggered by the host.
** Transforming into into the following items, which will be highlighted by [[Elemental Sight]]:
*** [[Electro Monument]] &mdash; Requires Electro to "activate"
*** Torch &mdash; Requires Pyro to "activate"
*** [[Rock Pile]] &mdash; Can be destroyed to "activate"
*** Vase &mdash; Can be hit to "activate"
*** Wooden crate &mdash; Can be hit to "activate"
*** Treasure Chest &mdash; Can be interacted to "activate"
**** These chests can be opened by interacting with it while the bake-danuki is inactive, such as at night, or by being fast enough so the bake-danuki does not reveal itself.
*** [[Thunderstone]] &mdash; Requires an [[Electrograna]] to "activate"
*** Explosive barrel &mdash; Can be hit to "activate"
* The bake-danuki will disappear in a puff of smoke while leaving behind an [[Investigation|investigation point]] once their "prank" is finished, with the rewards being as follows:
** If leading the player: [[Adventurer]], [[Lucky Dog]], [[Traveling Doctor]]
** If transformed: [[Cabbage]]s, [[Apple]]s, [[Carrot]]s, [[Radish]]es

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A carefree tanuki that comes and goes without leaving any trace, and that knows mystical arts passed down only amongst their kindred. It has the ability to transform into other objects, including humans.<br>Although they often tangle with a mysterious organization under the [[Shogunate]], the tanuki are not a wicked lot and only tease humans for fun.<br>There is but one recorded exception: years ago, the bake-danuki who guarded Chinju Forest started a battle due to some conflict between their leader Ioroi and a [[Kitsune Saiguu|kitsune]]. In the end, most of the bake-danuki were sealed within stone statues.|[[Archive]]}}
