==Trivia==
*The triangular symbol in the Mora coins is a {{w|triquetra}}.
*The currency is named after the Geo [[Archon]], Morax. However, in [[Liyue]], he is called Rex Lapis by locals, and it is considered impolite for outsiders to refer to him as Morax.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of Descension}}</ref> This is likely a matter of politeness, as Morax is the Geo Archon's name while Rex Lapis is more of a title.
*In the world of Teyvat, Mora is consumed by the weapons it enhances since it is a catalyst.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shadow of Yore}}</ref>
*Mora is exclusively minted at the [[Golden House]].
*According to [[Zhongli]], Mora cannot be minted without the Geo Archon's power, presumably his [[Gnosis]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> It is unknown if others can use the Geo Archon's power to mint Mora.
**This does not explain how Mora is generated from [[Ley Line Outcrops|Blossoms of Wealth]].
*It is unknown how much Mora is in circulation prior to the events of [[A New Star Approaches]].
