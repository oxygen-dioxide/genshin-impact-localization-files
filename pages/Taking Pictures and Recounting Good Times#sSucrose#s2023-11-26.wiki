:'''砂糖：'''好完整的头骨，圆圆的真可爱~
:'''派蒙：'''对了，砂糖~这些是我们在旅途中收集的各种骨头，送给你哦！
:'''旅行者：'''生日快乐，砂糖。
:'''砂糖：'''哇，都是从未见过的生物，真是太神奇了！可以的话，能给我介绍一下它们的来历嘛？
:'''派蒙：'''没问题，可是挖了一早上沙子，有点饿了…饿得晕晕的，脑袋也转不动…
:'''砂糖：'''啊，我有准备露营的食材，派蒙快先休息，先喝点水，都怪我只顾着寻找材料。
:'''派蒙：'''没…没关系啦，挖沙子也很有意思！

;Today is [[Sucrose]]'s birthday, let's go and celebrate with her!
:'''Sucrose:''' This skull's actually intact! It's all round and cute~
:'''Paimon:''' Oh right, Sucrose~ These are a few various bones we picked up on our journey. They're all for you! 
:'''Traveler:''' Happy birthday, Sucrose.
:'''Sucrose:''' Whoa, these are all new creatures to me! This is incredible! If you have the time, could you tell me where you got these?
:'''Paimon:''' Of course! But we've been digging all morning, and Paimon's kinda hungry... Paimon's brain is all scrambled...
:'''Sucrose:''' Ah, I prepared some camping food! Come and rest, Paimon. Have a drink of water. I'm sorry I've just been focusing on looking for materials.
:'''Paimon:''' I&mdash;It's okay! Digging up stuff in the sand is really interesting too!
