==Profile==
Huvishka is a man who observed the Interdarshan Championship 20 years ago, claiming it was the most exciting competition of them. He supports [[Cyno]] in the competition and explains that the [[Spantamad]] Darshan produces many talented people and has the highest percentage of winners in the championship; however, he expresses regret that the event will lose its suspense if more talented people participate. 

He also recollects his unnamed friend from the championship 20 years ago, who he says was honest and kind, but also vulnerable and sensitive, and that he takes care of his friends. He then claims it is in the past and that many of his friends have died, vanished, or are living in seclusion.
