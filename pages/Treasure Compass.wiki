'''Treasure Compasses''' are reusable [[gadget]]s that can be used to find nearby [[chests]] and are obtained through [[forging]]. There is currently one compass for each of the following [[region]]s: [[Mondstadt]], [[Liyue]], [[Inazuma]], and [[Sumeru]]. Their [[diagrams]] are all obtainable from [[Reputation]] rewards in their respective nations: at reputation level 6 for Mondstadt and Liyue, and at reputation level 9 for Inazuma and Sumeru.

<section begin="compass intro"/>Treasure compasses can be equipped through the [[Inventory]] and can be used after pressing the appropriate [[controls|control]]. After using a treasure compass, light that streams toward the nearest chest in the vicinity will briefly appear. The gadget then goes on cooldown for 30 seconds if a chest was detected or 5 seconds if not.

Unlike [[Oculus Resonance Stone]]s, treasure chest compasses have unlimited uses.<section end="compass intro"/>

** The [[Geo Treasure Compass]] can be used in the [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] map.
** The [[Electro Treasure Compass]] can be used in the [[Enkanomiya]] map.
