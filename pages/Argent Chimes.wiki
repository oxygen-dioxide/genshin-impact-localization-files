|description  = Lan Yan's outfit. The Lans of [[Chenyu Vale]] traditionally wear silver, and every piece that Lan Yan carries is a gift from her family. As she rambles through the mountains adorned from head to toe, they jingle merrily away like the joyful songs of spring swallows.

'''Argent Chimes''' is [[Lan Yan]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
Lan Yan's hair is styled into a side bang to the right and two shorter front strands framing her face. Her hair is split down her neck at the back, resembling twin tails. She dons a sliver headband and a hairpin of the Jade-Plumed Silverwing attached to the left of it.

Lan Yan wears a light green pleated dress with red and black zig-zag patterned ends and white ridges with tassels. She has dark teal sleeves decorated with white ridges and prismic beads, attached to a long cape where her {{Anemo}} [[Vision]] is hung in the middle by a small gem and adorned with golden and white tassels. For jewelery, she wears two wide silver bracelets on both her wrists and silver lanceolate-shaped earrings with green gems in the middle. On one of her thighs is a green band tied to a silver ornament. Lan Yan sports a pair of black closed-toe sandals with red bands and various small silver ornaments.
