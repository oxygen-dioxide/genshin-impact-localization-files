==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Harjo:''' Hello friend! Have you exercised today?
:{{DIcon}} All in good health, thanks to you.
::'''Harjo:''' Oho, such confidence! Then do you think you're in shape to take on one of Fontaine's [[meka]]?
::'''Harjo:''' I used to hear tales about mechanical warriors from those in Natlan who had traveled to Fontaine. They sounded so fantastical that I didn't know what to believe.
::'''Harjo:''' But excitement always overcame doubt. I had a feeling I'd make my way here one day to test my skills against them.
::'''Harjo:''' And now, that day has come!
::'''Harjo:''' I heard the strongest [[Gardemek]]s can be found in a place called the [[Fortress of Meropide]]. You've gotta find a way to get there and check them out, let me tell you.
::{{DIcon}} Please don't do anything illegal.
::'''Harjo:''' Ahaha, of course not! But why would you suddenly say something like that?
::'''Harjo:''' ...Huh? What's that? It's a place of exile for criminals? But that would make it... a prison!
::'''Harjo:''' No wonder the Gestionnaire who told me about it looked so serious.
::'''Harjo:''' Don't worry about me. I may seem casual and carefree, but in matters of honor, I am always serious.
::'''Harjo:''' Even when it comes to disputes, there's always a line to be drawn between honor and disgrace. Starting a conflict for the wrong reasons is certain to backfire.
:{{DIcon}} I will.
::'''Harjo:''' You've got this!
