'''Emura Chuuya''', also known as '''Emura Ichigensai''', is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Dream Eater's Melancholia}}.

==Profile==
Emura Chuuya is an [[Inazuma|Inazuman]] man and former client of the [[Aisa Bathhouse]]. Chuuya had a notably miserable childhood, being callously dismissed by his father for his ideals of becoming a writer and being ostracized by his schoolmates; this would ultimately shape him as an adult, making him become a short-tempered and prickly individual. Chuuya would later become known for his argumentative stances, often getting into arguments and taking glee in winning them and conversely throwing temper tantrums when losing them; examples of his behavior included writing letters at the [[Yae Publishing House]] and most notably, getting psychological consultation at the Aisa Bathhouse.

At said bathhouse, Chuuya received consultation from [[Yumemizuki Mizuki]], addressing the underlining issues leading to his behavior; however, in one such session involving one of Mizuki's assistants, [[Hyakujitsuhaku Shion]], his belligerent nature causes Mizuki's other assistant, [[Shiba Murasaki]], to blacklist him from the bathhouse. Out of spite and in an apparent attempt to steal business from the bathhouse, Chuuya begins his own spiritual healing service, located on the outskirts of [[Inazuma City]], under the pseudonym of '''Emura Ichigensai'''. At some point during the setting up of his service, Chuuya would also be used by [[Kuroyume]], the lone surviving nightmare youkai, as a catalyst to wrest control of Inazuma by reviving other members of his species.

Acting on a tip-off from [[Yae Miko]], the [[Traveler]] travels to the location of Emura Ichigensai's healing service, where they note that business was booming; due to a long waitlist, the Traveler leaves and returns later to find that he has closed for the day. They attempt to get information from two of his clients, [[Susukida]], a soldier, and [[Umihiko]], a sailor, but get no leads; the traveler then tracks a scent wafting from the building, leading to them having a nightmare which they would initially brush off. Further investigation by Mizuki and company leads them to believe Emura Ichigensai was likely Emura Chuuya, with her and the Traveler traveling back to the building only to encounter Susuhika and Umihiko again, now in a euphoric state, with them stating that Emura Ichigensai would not open that day; Mizuki would later use her powers to scry into the psyches of Susukida and Umihiko, who determines that all that Emura Ichigensai was doing was simply isolating their negative feelings from their positive ones so that the only thing they would be feeling was happiness. Mizuki notes that this was likely only possible through the use of something inhuman, with the Traveler bringing up their nightmare to Mizuki, confirming her suspicions.

Following further consultation with Miko, Mizuki and the Traveler head to Chuuya's place of residence and hideout, a dilapidated house just off the coast of Inazuma City. Now in his hideout, the Traveler and Mizuki fight off an ambush of nightmarish spirits and confront Chuuya, now in a state of euphoria, who declared that he had found a way to solve all his problems; Mizuki, seeing this as an opportunity, sits down for a "counseling" session with Chuuya, who gleefully obliges. Mizuki gives Emura Chuuya two scenarios based on Susukida and Umihiko's predicaments, with Chuuya's responses to both being for them to let go of their problems and all will be resolved; knowing Chuuya's argumentative nature, Mizuki dismantles his arguments, leaving him in panic and denial before Kuroyume exposes himself, who later completely possesses Chuuya, causing him to run away and scream in pure, unbridled terror. After entering Chuuya's subconscious, Mizuki uses Chuuya's pleasant memories to remove Kuroyume's hold on Chuuya and vanquish the sole surviving nightmare youkai. Chuuya is not seen again past this point, although it is implied that following this his memories and behavior have regressed to that of a child's.
