==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Contarini:''' *yawn* I was out for so long... But I'm still so sleepy... Why did I have such a strange dream...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Contarini:''' Me? Contarini Tiepolo, of the [[Maison Gardiennage|Special Security and Surveillance Patrol]], at your service.
::'''Contarini:''' I'm on leave at the moment, but if you encounter any violations of the law, please come straight to me anyway.
::'''Contarini:''' *sigh* Well, I say that, but it's not often that I come out on vacation, and yet I haven't had enough rest at all... *yawn*
:{{DIcon}} A strange dream, perhaps?
::'''Contarini:''' That's right, and for some reason it was an especially strange one. In the dream, I was constantly fighting with these weird fellows. No different from work, really...
::'''Contarini:''' There was a strange researcher from the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] in my dream who claimed that they had discovered the secret treasure of the [[Liliacruces Forum|Liliacruces Ordo]], and planned to transform us all into [[clockwork meka]]...
::'''Contarini:''' And not the normal kind, I'm talking about machines made of stone... I mean, it was a dream, right? Stone people don't really exist.
::'''Contarini:''' Whatever the case, I've been losing sleep in the fight against those guys... I bet Captain [[Chevreuse]] would've had trouble with that, let alone me...
::{{DIcon}} Secret treasure of the Liliacruces Ordo...?
::'''Contarini:''' *sigh* That's just a ridiculous legend.
::'''Contarini:''' They claim that there was a secret organization several hundred years back known as the Liliacruces Ordo, and that they left behind a treasure in Petrichor that could make any wish come true.
::'''Contarini:''' Sounds like exactly the sort of tale you'd tell to sucker tourists in, don't you think? But some still believe it... Like that [[Chandraputra|Sumeru researcher]] over there.
:{{DIcon}} Rest well.
::'''Contarini:''' Thanks for your kind words... *yawn* I guess I should head back and get some more sleep...
