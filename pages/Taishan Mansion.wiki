{{Stub|Verify unlock requirements. It seems users are able to play the Domain at AR25, and probably after completing the Archon Quest ''[[Of the Land Amidst Monoliths]]'' or ''[[Farewell, Archaic Lord]]''. Please check before completing Archon Quests if domain is playable. Otherwise, a notification when domain is unlocked after the quest supposedly shows up too. Screenshots of this would be appreciated but not required.}}
