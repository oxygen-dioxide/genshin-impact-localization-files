{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Pyro Regisvine

|name_1 = Elemental Nucleus
|desc_1 = When the battle begins, generates an Elemental Nucleus at its corolla. The Elemental Nucleus is a {{Pyro}} object and can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reaction]]s. It is weakest to {{Hydro}}.
{{Elemental Shield Data
|title   = Corolla Nucleus <small>(Normal)</small>
|element = Pyro
|gu      = 36

}}

|name_2 = Eruption

Each eruption deals '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. Additionally, during this attack, the Pyro Regisvine [[Vacuum Field|pushes]] characters away from the center of the arena. If the secondary Nucleus is destroyed, the Pyro Regisvine will become paraylzed for '''15''' seconds with reduced [[RES]] to all DMG.
{{Elemental Shield Data

This attack may be used 3 times in rapid succession.
|file_4 = Pyro Regisvine Faceplant Single

|desc_9 = A circle appears around the Regisvine indicating the radius of the attack. It will then flatten and stretch out its petals and spin, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} within the previously marked radius, knocking any characters back and infusing the ground in the radius with {{Pyro}} for '''10''' seconds. The infused ground will deal '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} to characters who step on it every second. After the spin, fires a large jet of flames at the player, dealing '''90% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} once and '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} every '''0.15''' seconds subsequently.
