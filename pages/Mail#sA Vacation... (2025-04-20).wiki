|text      = I have to say, my recent intel gathering has been going swimmingly indeed... Minus the wails of a few choice individuals.

But never mind them. I found our chats quite lovely. And after all that, I think I deserved a vacation, wouldn't you agree? [[Fontaine]]'s proven to be a great choice. The theater performances were truly spectacular. Good thing we don't have many ne'er-do-wells who can act half as well, though, or my work would be much trickier.

I had planned to stay a few days longer, but unfortunately, a tip reached me early. Guess it's curtains for this ordinary tourist.

This "bargaining chip" of theirs had better be worth interrupting my holiday for. Otherwise... Ah, who knows~

Oh right, before I let work drag me off, I got some souvenirs for you. They have my seal of approval. Try some, but not too much - sweet things should be savored slowly.
