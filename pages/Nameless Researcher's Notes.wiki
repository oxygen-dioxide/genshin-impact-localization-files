==Nameless Researcher's Notes (I)==
...Day 5: All is normal. The night sentry, Fadel, said he saw several figures on a nearby ridge. It may be bandits, or the legendary "Nagarjunites." Whichever it is, we will have to be much more careful going forward.<br>
...We pooled all our extra valuables. If there are unexpected circumstances, we can use them to buy passage, or our lives...<br>
...<br>
...Someone else spied the light of their fires again tonight. If we're not mistaken, they are following us. Yet it doesn't seem as though they intend to intercept or chase us. They are simply shadowing us and watching from a distance. They behave strangely, like a pack of coyotes. We must not let down our guard...

==Nameless Researcher's Notes (II)==
...<br>
...Early this morning the Nagarjunites warned us to turn around and leave immediately, saying there was nothing to see in the northern desert. Some of our bodyguards are from the desert, and they're already beginning to waver. Superstitious lot... Captain Parshid plans to negotiate with their leaders, but will the Nagarjunites be as amenable to reason as we are? I don't think it's a good idea, but since he's already decided to go...<br>
...<br>
...Captain Parshid was wounded by a crossbow bolt and some of his warriors also returned severely wounded... All of our desert bodyguards are spoiling for a fight. The air in the camp is heavy with danger... It is as I thought &mdash; it will not be so simple to make them see reason...<br>
...<br>
...Captain Parshid's wound is becoming seriously infected. Perhaps the bolt was poisoned...

==Nameless Researcher's Notes (III)==
...Day 10: We were subjected to a thorough looting...<br>
...The ones calling themselves the Nagarjunites still refuse to let us go. They knocked our night sentries out, and attacked the camp under cover of darkness...<br>
...Those thugs destroyed all of our academic findings, and plundered our food, water, and Sumpter Beasts. They say this is our punishment for harboring a felon &mdash; a mercenary named Narvash. If we don't turn him over, they won't ask again...<br>
...But Narvash is gone. Perhaps he escaped in the chaos, or is hiding somewhere. Either way, he's not in our camp...<br>
...<br>
...It's absurd. Narvash is a crippled old blind man who can't even speak clearly, and we're supposed to believe that he's some dangerous murderer?<br>
...<br>
...Captain Parshid's wound continues to worsen and is now showing signs of festering and necrosis. It must be the venom of the Consecrated Scorpion. Just a tiny bit is sufficient to paralyze most people for a week, and it is lethal if concentrated... Our stock of antivenom for this fearful toxin has been depleted to nothing. Those Nagarjunites must've nicked it during their raid a few days ago &mdash; they stole almost half of all our medicines. Looks like we have no choice but to turn back as soon as possible.<br>
But our first priority is to smooth things out with the Nagarjunites. If not, we'll have no way out...

==Nameless Researcher's Notes (IV)==
...<br>
...Captain Parshid has fallen unconscious. If we cannot bring down his fever in time, his life will be in critical danger...<br>
...<br>
...The Nagarjunites have relented. As night fell, they sent messengers with medicine and water, saying that they will leave. Apparently, someone has guaranteed that we would cease trespassing in forbidden areas. Naturally, for the sake of the contract and our own safety, we must return to the rainforest with all haste. What rotten luck...<br>
...I asked about the scorpion venom, but their messengers denied any use of poisoned weapons. They only wanted to teach us a lesson, not murder us.<br>
...<br>
...We followed the messengers' instructions and went to the camp of the person who vouched for us. They are to escort us back. How shameful, returning with nothing but empty hands and wounded bodies...<br>
...Their leader is a [[Jeht|girl with blue-purple hair and dark skin]]. She looks young, but the scars covering her body make it clear that she is someone to be feared. She is surrounded by a group of equally capable-looking young desert-dwellers, and they have an interesting [[Benben|mechanical contraption]] with them. She looks like the leader of a newly-formed mercenary group. She says she wants nothing to do with rainforest dwellers, and she only saved us because it was convenient. Her real target is someone called "[[Masseira]]." Some friend of hers has an old vendetta against him, and apparently this Masseira has also ticked off those Nagarjunite scoundrels. That's why they were willing to let her mediate.<br>
...If he was really on the same road as us, perhaps our rotten luck is the result of some ploy of his to cover his tracks? It's worth looking in to...<br>
...<br>
...Those young mercenaries treated Parshid's wound. He is still running a fever, but his life is out of danger. Kamrun returned from the campfire with a dislocated jaw... He must've done something really stupid, like riling up the girl with purple hair...<br>
...Or maybe he tried to steal that construct of hers. Either way, he deserves it!<br>
...<br>
...The purple-haired leader and I agreed on a price to see us safely home. We have to compensate her for delaying her vengeance with a hefty sum. But our highest priority is returning to the Akademiya alive. I hope nobody does anything stupid before we leave tomorrow morning...
