|text      = A few days ago, someone sat here reading the day away. When they left, they forgot their copy of "The Steambird" on the table.

Anyway, I riffled through it and couldn't help but think, once you go to Fontaine, then won't I be able to keep up with your latest comings and goings in the papers?

It looks like I'll have to make a habit of reading the newspaper.

But cutie, I believe you know better than anyone just how I feel about bothersome little things like that, don't you?

If you were willing to drop by the library on a suitable afternoon for some tea specially prepared by me and share your experiences and stories in person... it would be far more interesting and real.

Dessert is starting to feel a bit lonely...
