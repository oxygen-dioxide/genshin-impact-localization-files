==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' Hello. If you have no business in Tenshukaku, please do not loiter here.
:{{DIcon}} This place is...
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' This is Tenshukaku. As you can see, it stands at the highest point in Inazuma City. It serves as the residence of the most exalted, [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]].
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' The Almighty Shogun is someone of immense stature and power, with dominion over all life in Inazuma. Unconcerned persons are not allowed to disturb her.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' I am responsible for the security of Tenshukaku and the surrounding area, maintaining the order around the residence of the Almighty Shogun.
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' I and my men only take orders from the Almighty Shogun herself. If you have any requests to make, please see the officers of the [[Tri-Commission]].
::{{DIcon}} About the Tri-Commission...
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' You probably already know about the three major Commissions in charge of Inazuman affairs.
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' The [[Kanjou Commission]], the financial arm of Inazuma. They spare no effort to increase the nation's wealth.
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' The [[Yashiro Commission]], the cultural representative of Inazuma. They are responsible for ceremonial affairs and celebratory events. They appear to be the commission closest to the Almighty Shogun herself, so naturally they are also the closest to the people.
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' The [[Tenryou Commission]], the head of public security in Inazuma. They carry out government decrees to the T... and then there's the endless tussle with [[Watatsumi Army|the rebels of Sangonomiya]].
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' Thankfully they can't easily reassign Hatamoto's forces, otherwise we'd be dragged off to [[Kannazuka]] as well.
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' Anyway... Hmph, as long as it is for the future of Inazuma, I wish them nothing but the best.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you alone...
::'''Naoe Hisamasa:''' Alright. Goodbye.
