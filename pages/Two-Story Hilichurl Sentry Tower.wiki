|description    = A hilichurl sentry tower with two stories. It looks non-threatening by itself until you realize that a total of six archers may man it to repel any invaders.<br />Why not seven, you ask? Why, a seventh shooter would get bumped around all over the shop by their fellows, which would result in unnecessary infighting.
