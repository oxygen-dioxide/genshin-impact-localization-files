'''Flower of Paradise Lost''' is a [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities. It is obtained from [[City of Gold]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The maximum [[DMG Bonus]] for [[Bloom]]-related reactions provided by the 4-Piece Bonus is '''80%''' (40% + 4 × 25% × 40%), not 140% (40% + 4 × 25%).
** For Bloom-related reactions, the 80% Reaction DMG Bonus will surpass the Reaction DMG Bonus provided by the maximum of '''150''' [[Elemental Mastery]] provided by the 4-piece bonus of the [[Gilded Dreams]] artifact set when the wearer has above '''376''' base EM (including the 80 EM provided by the 2-piece bonus of both sets).

==Trivia==
*In Wilting Feast's original Chinese text, the line {{Zh|你所追寻的不过皆是捕风}}, localized as "You seek but to chain the winds," uses the metaphor {{Zh|捕风|lit=to capture wind}} for King Deshret's futile efforts. This metaphor is most prominently used in Chinese translations of Ecclesiastes 1:14&ndash;17, in which {{w|Solomon|King Solomon}} laments over his efforts to find the meanings of life and wisdom, only to find that both were meaningless.<ref group="Note">Ecclesiastes 1:14, 17<br>''Chinese Contemporary Bible:'' {{Zh|我观察一切日光之下所做的事, 看啊, 都是虚空, 好像'''捕风'''。[...] 我又专心察明智慧和知识、狂妄和愚昧，却发现这也是'''捕风'''。}}<br>''New International Version:'' I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a '''chasing after the wind'''. [...] Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a '''chasing after the wind'''.</ref> Interestingly, this is one of several minor allusions to legends about King Solomon, or other figures related to him, made in lore revolving around King Deshret; see [[King Deshret#Trivia|King Deshret § Trivia]] for more information.
