'''Flower of Paradise Lost''' is a [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities. It is obtained from [[City of Gold]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The maximum DMG Bonus for [[Bloom]]-related reactions provided by the 4-Piece Bonus is '''80%''' (40% + 4 × 25% × 40%), not 140% (40% + 4 × 25%).
** For Bloom-related reactions, the 80% Reaction DMG Bonus will surpass the Reaction DMG Bonus provided by the '''150''' [[Elemental Mastery]] provided by the [[Gilded Dreams]] artifact set when the wearer has above '''376''' base EM (including the 80EM provided by the 2-piece bonus of both sets).
** Below are the differences in Bloom-related Reaction DMG Bonus% between Gilded Dreams and Flower of Paradise Lost's 4-piece bonuses at certain EM thresholds (including the 80EM provided by the 2-piece bonus of both sets):
*** 400EM: '''~1.6'''
*** 500EM: '''~7.5'''
*** 600EM: '''~12.9'''
*** 700EM: '''~17.6'''
*** 800EM: '''~21.9'''
*** 900EM: '''~25.7'''
*** 1000EM: '''~29.2'''
*** 1250EM: '''~36.6'''
*** 1500EM: '''~42.4'''

==Trivia==
*In Wilting Feast, the line "You seek but to chain the winds" may relate to the way the [[Traveler]] is "[[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]]." The parallels are even more evident in the original Chinese text: [[Venti]] uses the equivalent phrase for Act I's title, {{Zh|捕风的异乡人|tl=foreigner who catches/caught the wind,}} to address the Traveler in ''[[Ending Note]]'' (the English localization says "Windborne Outlander" instead), while Wilting Feast's description directly uses the term {{Zh|捕风|tl=catch the wind}} where the English version chose to use "chain the winds."
