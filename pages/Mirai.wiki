==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Mirai''': When will [[Takahashi|Big Brother]] be able to return home...
:{{DIcon}} Where's your older brother gone?
::'''Mirai''': He's super awesome! He joined the army, and he's... Uh, in a really far away place, protecting all of us.
::'''Mirai''': This mission must be pretty important. He's been out for a really long time now...
::'''Mirai''': But I'm not a crybaby or a little kid anymore. I'll wait for him to come back.
::'''Mirai''': The last time my brother wrote back, he wrote about all sorts of things that happened to him out there. He sounded like he was in really high spirits. It must be because the mission's going well, and he can return soon!
::'''Mirai''': In that case, I'll go grab some flowers. When he comes back, I'll give them to him!
::{{DIcon}} Will you be alright by yourself?
:::'''Mirai''': Don't worry, I always go out and play, so I know the area around the village like the back of my hand.
:::'''Mirai''': Even if I fall down, I've got Big Sis [[Nishikino Reirei|Reirei]] to help me.
:::'''Mirai''': Big Sis Reirei's a doctor. She's a bit fierce, but she always helps me bandage the broken skin up, and she gives me some nice snacks, too!
:::'''Mirai''': Of course, I know that I shouldn't run around all the time and trouble everyone. My brother said that good kids learn from their mistakes, after all!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Do be careful.
:::'''Mirai''': Mm-hmm, thanks! You really remind me of my brother. He's always reminding me to do stuff too, hehe.
:::'''Mirai''': Oh, here's something that I found while I was out playing. You can have it!
:::'''Mirai''': It's okay, just take it. I've got lots of time to go find more.
::;(Obtain [[Sea Ganoderma]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} See you then, kiddo.
::'''Mirai''': Mm-hmm! See you!
