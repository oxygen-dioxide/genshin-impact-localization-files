===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Laume:''' Hello! Ah, you look like you're from outside the village. Excuse me, but would you accept my request for an interview?
:{{DIcon}} What? We've got reporters here too?
::'''Laume:''' Hehe. A journalist, huh... Looks like I give people the same impression as a real one, huh?
::'''Laume:''' That said, I'm not a real journalist. I'm studying hard to become one, though...
::'''Laume:''' Just like the ones who write for The Steambird!
::{{DIcon}} Oh, so there's a Melusine newspaper nowadays?
::'''Laume:''' I&mdash;I'm working on one of my own. I record the things that happen every day into it &mdash; and I make some drawings for it, too.
::'''Laume:''' Huh. Wait a moment, I'm the one conducting the interview, so why are you the one asking the questions? Well, whatever &mdash; as long as the content's newsworthy...
::'''Laume:''' Hmm... "Outland Visitor Reports Business to Merusea Chief Reporter! Guest Interested in the Future of Melusine News Industry!"
::'''Laume:''' Hehe, that's our title!
;(After Step 3 of ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'' and before completing ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Laume:''' Eh? You mean you felt that rumbling in the earth, too?
::'''Laume:''' This is a first for our village! Hmm, my journalistic intuition tells me that some big scoop is about to come along.
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this next time, shall we...
::'''Laume:''' Sure. Please be sure to accept my offer next time, though, alright?
{{Dialogue End}}

''Available after completing ''Ancient Colors''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Laume:''' I didn't think that something this huge would happen in the village. Everything was quaking! Thank goodness no one was injured...
:'''Laume:''' Well, a miraculous earthquake in which no one was injured sounds pretty cool, too!
:'''Laume:''' Ah, I heard of your heroics during the earthquake. What would you say to an interview?
