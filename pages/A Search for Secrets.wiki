{{Quest Description|While eating at Wanmin Restaurant, you encounter Yuandai and Shuyu. Yuandai, forgetful in her old age, cannot remember her past, but perhaps her having once been a chivalrous heroine is a good place to start...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Xingqiu)
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Huh, it's you two... What brings you here?
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xingqiu! Great, we found you. We wanted to ask you about something!
:{{Black Screen|You explain the situation to Xingqiu.}}
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Hmm... That's not a whole lot of information to go off of. I don't know if I can say for sure.
:{{DIcon}} That's fine.
:{{DIcon}} Anything is helpful and appreciated.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I can't pinpoint her identity from your description alone. But considering her age, I am reminded of a "nameless heroine" who's been featured in various chivalric novels.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nameless heroine?
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' That's right. The novels often speak of a great drought from fifty years ago. As the people suffered, a nameless heroine appeared and began to clear away evil spirits and bandit camps. The people idolized her but never learned her name.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' All they knew was that she always acted alone. Later, though, she supposedly fell in love with a similarly noble-minded exorcist from Mt. Tianheng. They were well-matched in more ways than one, often fighting together as a fearsome duo of otherworldly strength.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' After the drought ended, the heroine and the exorcist left the public eye and began living a reclusive life in the mountains. All that remained were tales of her incredible accomplishments.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' The way this nameless heroine faded from fame into obscurity later in life is not too dissimilar from Ms. Yuandai. I hope that's somewhat helpful.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks a lot Xingqiu! We knew it'd be worth talking to you.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It's nothing at all, just something I came across while reading. I did do a bit of extra research on her story, but it was just out of personal curiosity.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon still thinks that's super cool! Wait, Xingqiu, if you've read up on her, do you know of any places often associated with her?
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Let me think... In the novels, the nameless heroine always appeared near one of three places: Wangshu Inn, the area just north of Jueyun Karst, and Qingyun Peak.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Perhaps the real-life heroine who inspired the character was also often seen near those three places. That would explain why those locations appear in the various novels written about her.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks so much, Xingqiu!
:{{DIcon}} You were a huge help!
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 11.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Haha, you're welcome. To be honest, I found some parts of the story confusing when I first came across it. If Ms. Yuandai was indeed the original inspiration for the character, she may just be able to help me put the pieces together.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 12.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It's rare for a chivalric hero to fade into obscurity during their lifetime, even after retiring from the public eye. But no one ever saw or heard from the nameless heroine again... There were even rumors that she became extremely ill.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 13.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I've never understood why someone would go to such lengths to erase themselves from public memory. It's almost as if she was trying to hide from something... There's probably far more to the story than what's been written.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll be sure to tell you if we manage to uncover the truth!
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 14.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' That's a deal. Perhaps, behind the truth of it all, there lies a story more fantastical than any work of fiction.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon feels like we just learned so much from Xingqiu! A drought, a nameless heroine, a life of seclusion... Wait, why does this story sound super familiar?
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! There's a drought in this story, too. Um, Xingqiu, are droughts super common in Liyue or something?
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 15.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Well... They used to be. But people have long since developed methods to prevent them, like by cultivating the soil or digging canals.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 16.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' So while droughts do happen from time to time, they are rarely regarded as true disasters. The drought fifty years ago is probably one of the worst we've had in the last several centuries.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 17.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' The crops withered, the streams ran dry, and the monsters in the mountains became rabid and agitated. Countless caravans were attacked, and people who lost their homes came together to form bandit groups... What started as a natural disaster soon became a human tragedy as well.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds awful...
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 18.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Yeah, and that's exactly why the nameless heroine was so beloved. She must have been someone of true integrity, to do so much for the people while asking nothing in return.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 19.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Still, as terrible as that drought was, it was nothing compared to the truly calamitous disasters that befell this land in ancient times.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 20.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' They say that back in those days, disasters were both more severe and more common. Only the strongest of adepti could hope to dispel the ruin and devastation.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 21.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Do you have any other questions?
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're good for now! We're just going to head back and meet up with Ms. Xianyun and the others again.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes that Granny Yuandai will be able to remember more of her past! She used to be a great hero who saved many people. It's so sad that she can't recall any of it.
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, we'll be off now! See you some other time, Xingqiu. Thank you so much for your help!
:{{A|vo lylq002 1 xingqiu 22.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It's no problem at all. Safe travels.

;(Talk to Xingqiu again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog lylq002 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Time erases everything. Even the greatest of heroes will have their legacy reduced to the small fraction of their deeds that were committed to paper.
:{{A|vo dialog lylq002 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' But I think the magic of chivalric novels lies in the way you can catch glimpses of a noble soul from a few mere paragraphs.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|You hear from Xingqiu about three places that Yuandai may have been to when she was young. Time to meet up with the others at where Madame Ping is.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Madame Ping and Xianyun)
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 madameping 01.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I have recorded the tune that you requested. I hope it will be of help to you.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Thank you.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 madameping 02.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hehe...
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Streetward... Ping, what has amused you so?
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 madameping 03.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Oh, it's no serious matter. I was just reminiscing about the last time I saw you in this form... Time has wrought such change in this world, and yet, you appear just the same as ever.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Time has little bearing on one's existence, nor has one keenly felt its effects whilst dwelling at Mt. Aocang. Nevertheless, Ping... One would like to seek your counsel on a personal matter.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 madameping 04.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Oh? Why so formal all of a sudden? I must say, you're making me a little nervous. What is it?
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Well... The inquiry is as such...
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Approximately how much Mora would one need to afford a comfortable life in the Harbor, not unlike the one that you yourself lead?
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 madameping 05.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hmm... it does not require as much as you may think. Still, do you mean that&mdash;
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cloud Retainer, Madame Ping! What are you two talking about?
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Ahem... Nothing, save for some trivial matters. Have you unearthed any useful details?
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xingqiu has a theory... But let's save it for when Shuyu and Ms. Yuandai have joined up with us again.
:{{Black Screen|Shuyu and Yuandai soon arrive at the scene. Paimon relays Xingqiu's theory...}}
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' ...
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 madameping 06.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Do not be troubled, young lady. Here, have some tea.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 shuyu 02.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Ah... Thank you so much.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you think, Shuyu? Does it match up with what you know of your Granny?
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 shuyu 03.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' According to the story, the nameless heroine eventually fell in love with an exorcist from Mt. Tianheng. Maybe... that's my grandpa.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 shuyu 04.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I don't have many memories of him. But, there was this one time, I found a box in our attic full of a bunch of weird sigils.
:{{DIcon}} Seems like the stories were on the right track.
:{{DIcon}} We should probably pay a visit to the three places mentioned in the books.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 shuyu 05.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I think so too. Granny might remember something once she's returned to a familiar place.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' What marvelous tea... I can taste the dew's sweetness in this cup.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' It's as if I was taking a stroll in the mountains... thoroughly one with nature, and at peace...
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 madameping 07.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Is that so? Then please drink as much as you like. There's no need to hurry. At our age, it's always nice to slow down and take the time to appreciate pleasant conversation among friends.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 yuandai 03.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Thank you...
:{{DIcon}} Let's rest here for a little while, then.
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 shuyu 06.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Okay. Since we have the time... Could I ask you something?
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing! What would you like to know?
:{{A|vo lylq002 3 shuyu 07.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Um... I have a secret I wanna tell you. Let's go talk over there.

;(Talk to Madame Ping or Yuandai, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog lylq002 madameping 01.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' You can taste the sweetness of the dew?
:{{A|vo dialog lylq002 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' It's just a feeling &mdash; the sensation of stepping out into the mountains on a cool morning, gazing upon the small droplets of water hanging from the leaves, and feeling the sweet stream of water soothe a parched throat with every swallow...
:{{A|vo dialog lylq002 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' It's a sense of calm and serenity, one that stretches on and on, until days become weeks, weeks become years...

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's wrong, Shuyu?
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Well, I've kinda been meaning to ask ever since we started talking in the restaurant, but are you guys all... adepti in disguise?
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Uhh... About that...
:{{DIcon}} Why do you say that?
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 02.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Well, you guys just seem super special. Plus... I think I might've heard Ms. Xianyun call herself an adeptus.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh... Must have been a slip of the tongue, hehe... Xianyun, since you were the one who, uh, "misspoke," maybe you can explain to Shuyu here what you really meant by that.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Ahem...
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One is indeed an adeptus. Is that of some concern to you?
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh!?
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 03.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I knew it...
:{{DIcon}} You don't sound surprised at all.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 04.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Well... One time when I was a little kid, I saw a pure white illuminated crane.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 05.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I had this super high fever, and Granny wasn't around. I was feeling all icky and gross. But then, this snowy-white crane flew down from the sky!

:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 06.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' She put me on her back, and flew me to her cool adeptus house, and fed me some sort of magic potion. When I woke up, I was already back in my bed, and my fever was gone.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 07.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I really wanted to thank her, but I was too sleepy to stay awake, so I never got the chance.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 08.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' So, I just kinda wanted to ask if maybe... any of you have ever met an adeptus like that?
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A... pure white illuminated crane? The only two we've ever met are blue-and-white, and black-and-brown...
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you ever met one that's pure white, Cloud Retainer?
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmph. Never has one met an adeptus with such features. One surmises such a description is but a hyperbolic embellishment that oft results from narrative accounts.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 09.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' That's weird... Was it really just a dream, then?
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 10.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Well, even if it was just in my head, it doesn't matter that much anyway &mdash; all I really want is to help Granny recover her memories. I'm really grateful for all your help.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Leave it to us! Now that we know the three locations, we just need to visit them one by one.
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go to Wangshu Inn first!
:{{A|vo lylq002 5 shuyu 11.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Okay! I'll go get Granny.

;(Talk to Madame Ping, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog lylq002 madameping 02.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Leaving already? Well, just remember that you can come over for a cup of tea at any time.

{{Quest Description|Having finished chatting, the time for the investigation of places Yuandai has been to has come...}}
;(Approach Wangshu Inn)
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Wangshu Inn... Wangshu Inn...
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Do you remember this place, Granny?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Yes! The fish here is very delicious. And if you look out into the distance... you can always spot a bird that's been left behind by its flock.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 03.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I believe I used to have a room here. It had a window... Yes, yes, I spent a lot of time looking out that window. Which room was it again? Let me look...
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 shuyu 02.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I'll come with.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's still having some trouble understanding what she's talking about, but if she's so familiar with this place, that must mean she lived here, right? Wait... Huh!?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah! Xiao! What are you doing here all of a sudden? You scared the living daylights out of Paimon!
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I sensed a non-human presence and decided to come take a look.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' If you're here, then there's likely no trouble afoot. I suppose there's no cause for concern.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...It's been a while, Cloud Retainer. I see you have returned to your previous form.
:{{DIcon}} You've met her in this form before?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I have indeed. I fought alongside her in this form on many occasions during the [[Archon War]].
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh wow! What was she like during the War?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, let Paimon take a guess... Was it anything like this?
:;(An imaginary weapon appears beside Paimon)
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Behold the glory of one's newest invention, the Bang-Bang Continuous Fire Mechanism! Hands up in surrender, or be prepared to face the full might of the adepti!
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' An impressive imitation.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon knows her all too well!
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Even so, Cloud Retainer was not always as ostentatious as you describe. You may be unaware, but her talent with adepti sigils is just as formidable as her skill in mechanics.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The Archon War reached its peak after [[Guizhong]]'s death. The Cloud Retainer who fought beside me in those devastating battles was taciturn and solemn, only speaking when she had to activate her sigils.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A... Cloud Retainer who barely talks? Paimon can't picture it. But what happened after that? If you were so powerful in your human form, why did you decide to take up your bird form again?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Once one had bid farewell to the world of mortals, what use would one still have for such a shape?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' When dwelling between mountain and forest, away from the struggles and troubles of the mortal world, a mortal form is hardly the most fitting of choices.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' After the war, Cloud Retainer retired to Mt. Aocang, only revealing herself to the occasional visitor, and always in her avian form.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Although, I do believe there was an occasion some thirty odd years ago when she decided to don her human form. I believe it was for the purpose of&mdash;
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Ahem. One believes there is little need to relive bygone matters.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 shuyu 03.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Granny! Are you okay!?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 04.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Ahh... Back then, at this place, I...
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Perhaps this conversation should end here. I shall take my leave now.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Should you encounter any trouble, you need only call my name. However, given that you are traveling with Cloud Retainer, I trust you are in good hands.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 shuyu 04.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Everyone, I&mdash;I think Granny is finally beginning to remember her past!
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Slowly now. Calm your mind, and recount what has been recalled.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 05.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' A long time ago, I... stayed here to recuperate from my illness.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So what Xingqiu said was true? You did fall ill? Was that why you went into hiding?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 06.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I... don't remember. I'm very sorry, but I can't even remember the name of my illness. The only thing I can remember is that it took a great toll on me, and there was no cure for it.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 07.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I was confined to my room in Wangshu Inn, where I spent many days unconscious. I'd come to every once in a while and stare at the migrating birds outside the window. It was a solemn sight. I remember crying... but I'm not even sure I knew why...

</gallery>
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 08.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' One day, I met a traveling merchant. Upon hearing of my illness, he sold me a bottle of Soul-Revitalizing Teapills.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 09.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' He told me that the pills were concocted using adepti blood and could be used to alleviate my symptoms. Sure enough, I made a full recovery. My illness remained dormant for several decades after that.
:{{DIcon}} So the "dementia" you're suffering from now is actually...
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but if your illness "remained dormant" for several decades, are you saying that... what you're going through now is just a relapse of what happened all those years ago?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And it was all thanks to the pills that you managed to keep the symptoms in check? Ugh... Paimon's brain kinda hurts... Do you remember anything else?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 10.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I'm sorry, I don't. *sigh* Ahh... If only I wasn't so useless...
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 shuyu 05.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Hey, you're not useless! You've done so much for me, watched me grow up, raised me... How could you say that about yourself...
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 yuandai 11.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Fret not, dear child. Granny was just a bit frustrated. That's all...
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' The recovery of a person's memories is a gradual process. Finding pieces of one's past is always superior to not finding anything at all. Let us make haste to the next location.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Next location... next location... Why don't we go to the area north of Jueyun Karst next?
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There isn't really a landmark there, so where should we start? Oh, Paimon's got it! Let's check out the houses in the area first.
:{{A|vo lylq002 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, if she was there for any length of time, then she would've stayed somewhere, right? Paimon's really got her thinking cap on today! At this rate, we'll recover all of Granny Yuandai's memories in no time.
----
;(Approach the northwestern marked area)
:{{A|vo lylq002 11 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} What about this place? Any memories?
:{{A|vo lylq002 11 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I don't remember this place at all... I don't think I've ever been here before.
:{{A|vo lylq002 11 yuandai 03.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Still, I was thinking... This place feels perfect for a game of hide-and-seek.
:{{A|vo lylq002 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why a game of hide-and-seek?
:{{A|vo lylq002 11 yuandai 04.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I'm not sure. Maybe it's because... I used to play that game a lot with Shuyu when she was younger.
:{{A|vo lylq002 11 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Hmm, I don't remember playing it that much. Are you sure about that, Granny? We only played a few times, and we stopped once we realized I was no good at the whole seeking part.
:{{A|vo lylq002 11 yuandai 05.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Ah, is that so? Then I must be mistaken.
:{{A|vo lylq002 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, not here, then... Let's try somewhere else.

;(Approach the southeastern marked area)
:{{A|vo lylq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Why are there so many Treasure Hoarders here?
:{{A|vo lylq002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess it's time to round up some bad guys, {{Traveler}}!

;(Defeat the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo lylq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you remember anything about this place, Granny Yuandai?
:{{A|vo lylq002 9 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Let me think... I feel like I've been here before.
:{{A|vo lylq002 9 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' But I don't think I stayed here too long. I might have just rested here briefly before continuing on my way.
:{{A|vo lylq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it... That's okay, there are still plenty of other places we can check!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo lylq002 10 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Wait a second. If I remember correctly... I believe I brought... Ah yes, I brought some sweet snacks with me.
:{{A|vo lylq002 10 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Go on, take some. You need to eat a lot if you want to grow big and strong...
:{{A|vo lylq002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, thank you! Then Paimon will help herself!

;(Approach the southwestern marked area)
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon sees an abandoned house! Why don't we take a break over there?
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' This place... It's...
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Did you remember something, Granny?
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I... I remember. Shuyu... This is where your father was born.
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 03.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' It was a moonless night. I had been injured, so your Grandpa was supporting me. We fled together, with some being in the fog behind us in hot pursuit...
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 04.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I had exhausted my strength when the labor pains came on, so we took refuge in this house. Your Grandpa set up a barrier outside, but neither of us knew if it could hold the monsters back.

:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 05.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I remember that night... I remember falling to my knees, reciting a prayer over and over.
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 06.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I alone am the source of this sin. Punish me as you wish for forsaking my oath, but spare my innocent child.
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Sin? Oath? Did you do something wrong?
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 07.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I don't know... I don't remember. I only remember praying in the darkness with all my strength, until the sun finally rose again, and the fog cleared out.
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 08.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Eventually, the house was filled with the sound of my baby's first cries. That baby was your father. I remember... I clutched him tight to my chest and wept tears of joy. It was the first time I'd ever felt such happiness in my life.
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 shuyu 02.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' My dad...
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 09.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' He was my pride and joy, and so are you, Shuyu. You're so much like him, and I love you both so much...
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 10.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' But you're... always going to be different from me. I... Why... Just what did I do?
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 shuyu 03.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' I don't care what you might have done, Granny. You'll always be the person I love more than anything.
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 11.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' You're too sweet, Shuyu. I'm lucky to have you with me... If not for you, I would not have had the courage to come here, to try to remember what I've forgotten.
:{{A|vo lylq002 12 yuandai 12.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Alright, let's not stand around any longer. There's one place left, yes? Let's go take a look.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo lylq002 13 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' If one recalls correctly, the next place should be Qingyun Peak. Yuandai, how fares your health?
:{{A|vo lylq002 13 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I may be a bit slow, but I'll do my best to keep up. I'm sorry to keep everyone waiting...
:{{A|vo lylq002 13 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Climb on. I shall carry you to the top.
:{{A|vo lylq002 13 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Such lightness of weight.
:{{A|vo lylq002 13 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' All those who grow old grow frail in the end, do they not? First, you lose your memory, then your health. Eventually, you end up losing everything.
:{{A|vo lylq002 13 yuandai 03.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' My only wish is to depart this world with a lucid mind, to free myself of this torment and the burden it places upon others...
:{{A|vo lylq002 13 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Fret not. You have my aid in this endeavor.
----
;(Approach the marked location on Qingyun Peak)
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, we're finally here!
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does this place feel familiar to you, Granny Yuandai?
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 01.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Let me see...
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 02.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' ...How strange. Have I... lived here before?
:{{DIcon}} Take it easy.
:{{DIcon}} Take your time.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 03.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' When we were at Wangshu Inn and the abandoned house earlier, though I couldn't remember everything, I still... felt a sense of familiarity. I could easily picture myself in those places...
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 04.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' But here... I don't have that feeling. Perhaps I did come here in the past, but it just didn't leave a strong impression on me.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... Did the stories get it wrong, then?
:{{DIcon}} We can't expect them to get everything right.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's true... But they're also the only thing we have to go off of.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon was hoping this place would jog Granny Yuandai's memory just like the others.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 05.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' I'm sorry to disappoint you two.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's alright! We're not going to give up yet! We'll figure something else out, just you wait!
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 06.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Thank you. If only I could remember...
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 07.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Huh? That way... What's that mountain?
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, let Paimon look &mdash; huh!? Isn't that Mt. Aocang? Looks like we've come full circle!
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 08.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Mt. Aocang... Mt. Aocang...
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 shuyu 01.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Granny? Are you okay?
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 shuyu 02.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' Don't push yourself, Granny. It's okay if you can't remember... You shouldn't do something that makes you sad...
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 09.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' Mt. Aocang. I... What am I, really...
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Mt. Aocang holds some familiarity to you?
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 10.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' It does. But I... I can't go back...
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Are you feeling unwell?
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 yuandai 11.ogg}} '''Yuandai:''' My head... It feels all heavy and dizzy. Just what is wrong with me?
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cloud... Ms. Xianyun. Is there anything you can do...?
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Let us go to Mt. Aocang.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 shuyu 03.ogg}} '''Shuyu:''' ...But&mdash;
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Fret not, all will be well. Yuandai, you have already given more than enough to the pursuit of this endeavor.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' You may leave the rest to me. I've prepared something that can aid you in suppressing the fear in your heart and restoring your lost memories. It currently resides at Mt. Aocang.
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, really!? When did you do that?
:{{A|vo lylq002 14 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hah, I never leave anything to chance. All will reveal itself when we arrive.
