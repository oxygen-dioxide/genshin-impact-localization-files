==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Augereau:''' Hello. Do you need any help?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a bit about yourself...
::'''Augereau:''' I'm a member of the Gardes in charge of keeping [[Romaritime Harbor]] safe. Feel free to call for me if you encounter any trouble.
::'''Augereau:''' I've got a good pair of eyes and a quick pair of legs, so any suspect who wishes to escape outside our borders will have to pass me first.
::'''Augereau:''' Haha, just kidding. I exaggerate, somewhat.
::'''Augereau:''' People come and go all around this place, but most of the work is done by machines &mdash; everything's pretty well organized.
;(Available after Step 9 of ''[[Soloist's Prologue]]'')
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
::'''Augereau:''' Well, I've always been for believing in such mysterious things.
::'''Augereau:''' And as a result, I've found myself saddled with conflicting rumors. If I were to become too obsessed with them, I'll be stuck with a troubled life... for life, you know?
::'''Augereau:''' So yeah, I think you can believe in such things, but there's no point thinking too hard about them. I'm just an ordinary person without much ambition to change fate.
::'''Augereau:''' So whichever of the rumors turns out to be true, I'll be fine with it.
;(Available after completing ''[[The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the prophecy...
::'''Augereau:''' I never thought the prophecy would actually come true! Although, it didn't turn out quite as expected...
::'''Augereau:''' Can't really say I'm disappointed though, more like happy! After all, even if the flood caused some trouble, we Fontainians didn't really dissolve.
::'''Augereau:''' [[Palais Mermonia]] had arranged an emergency plan before disaster struck, so we escaped the worst, thank goodness.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Augereau:''' Take care of yourself, and stay safe.
