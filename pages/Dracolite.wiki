'''Dracolite''' is a [[Local Specialty]] found in [[Atocpan]], [[Natlan]]. 

==How to Obtain==
{{Stub|Exact terminology and trigger method needed for the Tatankasaurus's empowered rush state}}
Dracolite can be harvested after breaking the corresponding ores. The ores come in two sizes; the smaller one contains {{Item|Dracolite|x=1}}, and the larger one contains {{Item|Dracolite|x=2}}.

Dracolite ores are {{Pyro}} objects and can only be destroyed using [[Elemental Reactions]]. Additionally, their durability is greatly reduced when they are hit by [[Overloaded]] DMG, including Overloaded DMG that was triggered using nearby Dracolite or the environment. One instance of Overloaded DMG will break the smaller size, and two instances of Overloaded DMG will break the larger size. However, both sizes have the same durability against all other elemental reactions.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Pyro|40|dracolite=1}}<!-- GU needed from Cryo, Hydro, Anemo, and Geo (80, 20, 80, and 80) verified via testing each element alone on both sizes; Electro GU verified via pixel counting with Beidou's burst on the large size-->

All Dracolite of both sizes can be instantly broken without Overloaded damage by:
* [[Iansan]]'s third Normal Attack
* [[Varesa]]'s third Normal Attack (both in and out of her Fiery Passion state)<!-- yes, specifically the third NA alone -->
* The [[Collective of Plenty]]'s empowered rush ability:
** The [[Tatankasaurus]]'s {{tx}}
** Iansan's Rushing Thunderbolt mode, triggered temporarily by holding [[sprint]] during her [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state
** [[Varesa]]'s Sudden Onrush mode, triggered by holding her Elemental Skill, [[Riding the Night-Rainbow]]

==Description==
{{Description|Found in areas rich in Phlogiston, these red, scalelike crystals are blazing-hot to the touch.<br>These are commonly found around the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]], possibly due to periodic volcanic eruptions infusing the surrounding rocks with Phlogiston. Legend has it that a brave warrior once fought a dragon and cleaved scales from the beast's neck, and when the scales fell to the ground, they turned into Dracolite.|[[Archive]]}}
