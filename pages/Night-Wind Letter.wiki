{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Read Ororon's invitation)
::'''Ororon's Request for Help'''
::{{Traveler}}, I know this is a bit out of the blue, but I've run into a tricky situation and really need your help.<br>If you happen to have the time and the inclination, and don't mind stretching your legs for the long journey over, please pay me a visit over at the Masters of the Night-Wind.<br>I'm sure that things will take a turn for the better once you're here.<br>Thanks, I'm counting on you.

;(Approach Ororon)
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Once {{Traveler}} shows up, everything will get better...
:{{Introductory Note|Ororon}}
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Ororon, over here!
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Oh, hey there, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you were looking for us? We came as soon as we heard.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You did? That makes me feel... warm and fuzzy. Is this what happiness feels like?
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...The heck? Where is this coming from...?
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You are truly the best friends I could ask for. If my vegetables met you, I'm sure they'd grow all the more lush for it.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... what makes you say that?
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 05.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Well, it's a compliment. I heard that complimenting people makes them happy. Did it work? Are you happy?
:{{DIcon}} Very much so, but what about you? You don't look too happy.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 06.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' It's that obvious, huh? Well, you're right. I feel like an aphid who can't find a flower. Granny is standing in my way.
:{{DIcon}} You mean, Citlali?
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 07.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Yes. Granny's a genius, as you know. Geniuses often stand in the way of others, leading them to despair.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 08.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' And on top of that, I'm her grandson. Which means I get a double dose of despair.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 09.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' If that sounds serious... it's because it is. So please, help me deal with her.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened, exactly? You make it sound so dramatic...
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 10.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I had to get you involved. Most people can't deal with Granny, and...
:{{DIcon}} And I'm an exception.
::{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 11a 1a.ogg}} {{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 11a 1b.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Exactly! You were the first person I thought of, {{MC|m=Gramps|f=other Granny}}.
:{{DIcon}} Haha, and you think I can!?
::{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 11b 1a.ogg}} {{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 11b 1b.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Of course you can! You were the first person I thought of, {{MC|m=Gramps|f=other Granny}}.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 12a.ogg}} {{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 12b.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' {{MC|m="Gramps"|f="Granny"}} is what I called you when we first met, and I know I got told off for it... but please let me off for calling you that one more time.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 13.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' It feels like there's something unique about you. Even Granny Citlali treats you like you're someone special. And everything that's happened since we met suggests it's true.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 14.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' If I had a woven scroll that listed the forty people who can deal with Granny Citlali, your name would be at the top of that list.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so who are these other thirty-nine?
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 15.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' They're also {{Traveler}}. A whole thirty-nine {{Traveler}} after the first one.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Also the Traveler. The rest of the list is just the Traveler, thirty-nine more times."</ref>
:{{DIcon}} You flatter me, but I'm too young to be a grandparent.
::{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 16a 1.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Please, you've gotta help me. This is really important.
:{{DIcon}} Anything for my favorite grandson.
::{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 16b 1a.ogg}} {{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 16b 1b.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Great, so you're gonna help me, right {{MC|m="Gramps"|f="Granny"}}? I can't stress how important this is.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 17.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Although it looks like I'm just hanging around with nothing to do, inside, I'm distraught about the path ahead. Granny Citlali is blocking my way and I can't get past.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 18.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' But now that you're here, I can start moving again. Before time runs out.
:{{DIcon}} Okay, so what do you need me to do?
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 19.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You know how much Granny loves to drink, nap, and read light novels, right? If you offer her what she wants, I'm sure you can lure her away.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean, use those things as bait to distract her, so she won't notice what you're up to?
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 20.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' That's right. Don't worry, I won't make you do all the work &mdash; I've planned it all out, including what you need to say. All you need to do is walk up to her, and tell her this:
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 21.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' "Dear Granny, I have the latest volume of 'Mirage Warriors' here, along with a special-edition spinoff of 'The Case Files of Miss Orith.' Wanna read them together?"
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 22.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' She'll pretend not to be interested for a few seconds, then think of an excuse to say yes. As long as you're the one doing the fishing, she'll definitely take the bait.
:{{DIcon}} You really think I have that effect on her?
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's just trying to butter you up! Even Paimon can tell. He's just saying whatever it takes to persuade you.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 23.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' No, I mean it. Granny might not say it out loud, but I can tell &mdash; she has a soft spot for {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you say so... Paimon's still not convinced, but if all we have to do is say a few words to Citlali, it's hardly putting us out.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 24.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' It'll be as easy as watering vegetables &mdash; and if my vegetables were here, they'd... Uh, sorry, there's no time for vegetable talk.
:{{A|vo tleq001 1 olorun 25.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Just trust me. Let me take you to her. With you there, everything will be better.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the matter?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' It's Granny... She's gone.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' She was standing there at the cave entrance to stop me from going in. Standing right in my way.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you meant literally standing in your way... This whole time, Paimon thought you were being metaphorical.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Granny says it's tacky when light novels use contrived metaphors. I don't wanna be tacky.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but aren't you comparing yourself to a light novel? Isn't that kinda contrived...?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 05.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' What? Oh... darn it...
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, looks like your path ahead has been cleared.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Citlali probably figured there was no point standing in your way anymore. Ororon, whatever it is you so desperately need to do, you're now free to do it.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 06.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I don't think it'll be that simple... Granny wouldn't release me from her grasp so easily.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 07.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' She might have laid a trap for me. Or maybe when I get inside, I'll get caught by one of her surveillance spells...
:{{DIcon}} But why would she want to stop you?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, let alone lay a trap for you! Unless... You haven't been up to no good again, have you?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 08.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I just want to rescue someone... and Granny won't let me.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Rescue someone!? Oh no, what happened?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 09.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Could I ask you to go inside and take a look at him? I think he should be safe for now, but he'll be at greater and greater risk as time goes by.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But then... What are you going to do?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 10.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I'll have to wait outside, or I might fall into one of Granny's traps.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...You mean, you want us to fall into her traps instead?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 11.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' No, you'll be fine. Granny's traps will recognize it's {{Traveler}}, so they'll leave you alone.
:{{DIcon}} Really? That's a thing?
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 12.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Sure it is &mdash; I mean, I've told my aphids all about your heroic deeds, so I assume Granny's told her traps, too.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You... You can't just assume that!
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 13a.ogg}} {{A|vo tleq001 2 olorun 13b.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Either way... I'm counting on you, {{MC|m=Gramps|f=Granny}}.
:{{A|vo tleq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're the best, {{MC|m=Gramps|f=Granny}}! ...Please can you go inside and take a look?<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Well... Sounds like someone's life is at stake, so we should probably head in and check things out."</ref>

;(Talk to Ororon, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog tleq001 olorun 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo dialog tleq001 olorun 01b.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You are the best, {{MC|m=Gramps|f=Granny}}. Please, can you go inside and take a look?
----
;(Enter the cave)
:{{A|vo tleq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess we just keep following this path...?
:{{A|vo tleq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ororon seemed pretty confident that Citlali's traps won't harm us, but still, it can't hurt to be careful.

;(Approach the ritual site)
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, we made it in without a hitch! Maybe Citlali's traps can recognize us after all!
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, look! There's someone there!
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi! Are you okay? Can you hear us?
:{{DIcon}} He's not responding.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is he asleep? Or sick? ...Do you think this is the guy Ororon was talking about?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, what the heck's been going on here? Lots of strange and mysterious stuff around...
:{{DIcon}} Looks like some kind of ritual.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, could be... Let's get Ororon in here. He'll know what this is all about.
:;(Ororon walks into the cave following Citlali)
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Sorry, Granny.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' All grown up now, are we?
:{{Introductory Note|Citlali}}
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' ...I'm truly sorry.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Now that you're one of the six heroes, you think you can do as you please, do you? Hmm?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Well? Explain yourself, you dummy! How exactly were you thinking of helping that spirit-duffer?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ororon! And, uhh... hey, Citlali.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Huh? HUH??? When did you guys...
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 05a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 05b.ogg}}--> '''Citlali:''' (Drat, I wasn't expecting them. And now {{Traveler}} probably caught me yelling at Ororon... Aah, this is not a good look for me!)
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Haha... Hello there, you two. We were just, um... Ororon and I, we were, uh... play acting...
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You know, acting out some scenes from a light novel, quoting the lines... I didn't actually mean what I was saying. Right, Ororon?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Huh? Uh... Yes, that's right.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I owe you an apology too, {{Traveler}}. I asked you for help, but I forgot to watch my back, and Granny caught me... And now we're play-acting.
:{{DIcon}} There's no need to apologize.
:{{DIcon}} Just watch your back next time.
:{{DIcon}} Play acting, huh? Can I join in?
::{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 08c 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Traveler, come on."</ref> Now's not the time for games.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what are you two up to, exactly? Did something happen to this poor guy?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Yeah &mdash; Leyla's his name. He got into some trouble during a clairvoyance session.
:{{DIcon}} Clairvoyance?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It's a kind of spell that lets your spirit leave your body, so you can access secret knowledge. You know what a medium is, right? You've probably come across them in novels. Anyway, it's similar to that.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Leyla's problem is, his spirit has gotten lost and can't find its way back to his body.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, in other words, his body's here, but his soul's gone!
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Well, technically the soul and the spirit aren't quite the same thing... but yes, in a nutshell, that's basically it.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 05.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I just wanted to help bring Leyla's spirit back...
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hmph, and I wouldn't have stopped him if it was anyone else. But the issue is, Mr. Leyla here is what we call a "spirit-duffer."
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's a spirit-duffer?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 13.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Someone with no spiritual sensitivity whatsoever. Spirit-duffers can't sense or control spirits, much less use spells on them.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Now, there are certain methods that can force even spirit-duffers into a clairvoyant state, but... well, I mean, look what happened to Mr. Leyla.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 15.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The spells of the Masters of the Night-Wind are all based on dealing with spirits, and so are all our problem-solving methods. So for spirit-duffers, even our healing methods don't work on them.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 16.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' So if they get into trouble trying to use a spell, there's basically nothing we can do.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 06.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Yes, there is. As long as the soul is involved, I should be able to help...
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 17.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You hear that? No prizes for guessing what Ororon's bright idea was.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Because of your special constitution, right? But isn't that kinda risky for you?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 07.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I'll be fine &mdash; Granny's just worrying too much. I'm feeling fine now, so I should be able to do it safely. Besides, it's probably our only hope of bringing Leyla back.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 18.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Don't kid yourself. What happens if it's not as safe as you're hoping, hmm? We both know you'll risk it all to try and rescue him anyway. Honestly, you're such an idiot sometimes.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... This is a tricky one. It's true that Ororon can be self-sacrificing to a fault, but it's also true that Citlali tends to worry too much...
:{{DIcon}} I'm with Citlali on this. Ororon is being an idiot.
::{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 08a 1.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Call me an idiot all you want &mdash; I know I can bring his spirit back. I just need your support.
::{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 19a 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hey! That's enough, you little squirt. Since when does the grandkid call the shots? Granny obviously knows how to handle this.
:{{DIcon}} I'm with Ororon. Citlali's the one being an idiot.
::{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 19b 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hey! That's Granny Itztli to you! Who do you take me for? I obviously know how to handle this.
:{{DIcon}} I bet you've got a plan, huh, Citlali?
::{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 19c 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hehe, you're darn right Granny Itztli's got a plan! Why else do you think I'd be here?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You do?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 09.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Wait, really? You actually know a way to save him?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 20.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Yes! I mean, it's a crude solution... but that's beside the point! The point being, don't interfere when Granny's already got things under control!
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 21.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Anyway. {{Traveler}}, I was actually going to ask for your help on this. My plan will take quite a lot of work, and it's a little too much for one person.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, great! Well, it's a good thing Ororon brought us here then!
:{{DIcon}} Sure, how can I help?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 22.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I intend to use a two-pronged approach. The first is the crude method &mdash; basically, it's looking for a needle in a haystack.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 23.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' See the thing I've drawn around Leyla's body? That's a gateway to the [[Night Kingdom]].
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 24.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Once the gateway is activated, all roaming spirits in the area will be drawn to it. If we're lucky, we'll find the one that belongs to Leyla.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 25.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I'll lend you some of my power like last time, so you can use my clairvoyance. It only works if you use this projection censer first though, so don't forget that step.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 26.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Don't worry, this time nothing can go wrong! You'll just feel like you're in the Night Kingdom, and you'll see a lot of roaming spirits around you. All you need to do is gather them up.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 27.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You can leave Ororon to sift through them and find Leyla. Since he wants to help so bad, he can take the hardest job.
:{{DIcon}} What's the other approach?
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 28.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Draw him back, using what I know about the instincts of spirits. As we all know, clairvoyance is usually conducted with the goal of unraveling mysteries.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 29.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' If we can find out what mystery Leyla wanted to learn the truth of, we can use that to draw his lost spirit back here.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 30.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I'll do some clairvoyance of my own, and channel it through Leyla's body. That should give me some idea of what he was thinking.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Paimon thinks she gets it now. The first approach is like fishing with a net, and the second is like fishing with bait. Just like how Ororon wanted us to lure you away with the promise of light novels!
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 10.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Um... Your point would have been just as clear without the example, Paimon.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 31.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' What!? ...Don't think I won't revisit this later.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 olorun 11.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' But Granny, it's amazing that you can use a person as a clairvoyance medium. I always thought you had to use inanimate objects.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 32.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hmph, you can't flatter your way out of this one! But you're not wrong. A person without a spirit is just a physical shell &mdash; which, for our purposes, makes them an inanimate object.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 33.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' {{Traveler}}, just over there is my spiritloom, which will record the fragments I see during clairvoyance. Once I begin, please arrange them on a woven scroll for me.
:{{A|vo tleq001 5 citlali 34.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Let me know when you're ready. We should get to work.

;(Talk to Leyla, optional)
:'''Leyla:''' ...

;(Talk to Ororon, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog tleq001 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You can do it, {{Traveler}}! Together, we'll bring Leyla back for sure.

;(Talk to Citlali)
:{{A|vo dialog tleq001 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Are you ready? Don't worry, the spiritloom is very easy to use.
:{{DIcon|Restoring Fragmented Records}} Alright, I'll give it a try.
::{{A|vo dialog tleq001 citlali 02a 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I know this is your first time working with it, but I have a feeling you'll do great.
:{{DIcon}} I need a little more time.
::{{A|vo dialog tleq001 citlali 02b 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Sure.

;(After restoring the shard)
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! The woven scroll is ready! This looks like a person... Who is it?

:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' ...
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It's [[Sanhaj Kompore]]...
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You mean, THAT Sanhaj? Ororon's ancient name hero guy?
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' That's right. He was not only one of the six heroes, but also a legendary Border Master of our tribe. Five hundred years on, and the remains of his spirit is still so strong...
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' "Border Master" is a honorable title, by the way. It's only given to powerful figures, like Granny Citlali.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' No, not like me. The most powerful Border Masters can expand the borders of the Night Kingdom, and temporarily manifest part of it in the real world.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I'm no amateur with border spells, but Sanhaj is in a league of his own.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' They say his border mastery was what turned the tide in the [[Battle of the Mare Jivari]] five hundred years ago. Legend has it that Sanhaj summoned a miniature Night Kingdom and exploded it to defeat the encroaching dark calamity.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! He must have been really strong!
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Of course, it came at a great price. As far as I understand, both Sanhaj and [[Tenoch]], the leader of the tribal coalition forces, gave their lives to activate this spell.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I don't know what Leyla was thinking... Even I'd think twice before seeking out Sanhaj Kompore during clairvoyance, so what sort of spirit-duffer in their right mind would... Hmph, I guess folly is the greater part of bravery.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I'm starting to feel like something else is at play here. I think I'll pay a visit to his house and see if I can find any clues.
:{{DIcon}} What about the other approach? Shall we keep that up while you're gone?
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Yep, you can keep gathering the roaming spirits, that won't be affected. Hopefully you do find Leyla that way, because it'll save us an awful lot of trouble...
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But before that, it looks like we now have another problem on our hands. Connecting with the spirit of Sanhaj Kompore has caused quite a stir... I think we may have just spooked all the monsters in the area.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' {{Traveler}}, if you've got some time, could you go and get them to pipe down a bit? We don't want them to start attacking innocent bystanders.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' It's fine, I can handle that.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 13a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 13b.ogg}}--> '''Citlali:''' Oh no &mdash; you're staying right here, mister! {{Traveler}} has enough to do already without coming to your rescue.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Alright then... Sorry, {{Traveler}}. Over to you, I guess.
:{{DIcon}} No problem, it'll be a piece of cake.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, don't sweat it. The most important thing right now is getting Leyla's spirit back.
:{{A|vo tleq001 8 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Alright, I'm heading out. See you guys later.

;(Talk to Ororon)
:{{A|vo tleq001 9 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' {{Traveler}}, could I trouble you to keep gathering the roaming spirits over the next few days? Just make sure to use this censer &mdash; Granny already applied her spell to it.
:{{DIcon}} About the spiritloom...
::{{A|vo tleq001 9 olorun 02a 1.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Oh, you liked playing with that, huh? Feel free to try it again whenever you want. There should be some other clairvoyance records you can arrange on a woven scroll. It's pretty fun.
::{{A|vo tleq001 9 olorun 02a 2.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Don't worry about Granny. I'm sure she only left it here so you can get some practice.
:{{DIcon}} About the [[Mare Jivari]]...
::{{A|vo tleq001 9 olorun 02b 1.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' The Mare Jivari? Terrible place to grow vegetables, for one thing.
::{{A|vo tleq001 9 olorun 02b 2.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' And if you're wondering how I would know that &mdash; well, it's because Granny told me. If you want to know more, you should probably ask her when she gets back.
::{{A|vo tleq001 9 olorun 02b 3.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' She has some scrolls on the subject in her house, but my rule is: If you can't grow vegetables there, I'm not interested. So I've never given them a second look. Truly sorry.
