==Gameplay Notes==
* Despite the description only mentioning [[Normal Attack]], the first stack of Mistsplitter's Emblem will also be granted if a [[Charged Attack]] deals Elemental DMG. However, [[Plunging Attack]]s do not grant a stack.
* A maximum of 1 stack can be gained from each of the 3 scenarios. For example, dealing Elemental DMG with Normal Attacks twice will ''not'' grant 2 independent stacks, and will only refresh the 5s duration of the first stack.
* While the passive effect is active, a purple glow will appear around the weapon. The brightness of the glow changes based on the number of stacks active.

==Description==
One of the swords that the [[Shogun]] bestowed upon her Hatamoto. It is said that it can call upon the power of lightning itself to slice through the mountain mist and night fog.<br>
It was once shattered into a thousand pieces. After being reforged, a {{w|hamon_(swordsmithing)|hamon}} resembling flowing clouds was left on the blade.

As the folk song goes: "[[Otogi King|Arataki of the Front Gate]], [[Iwakura Michihiro|Iwakura the Successor]], [[Kitain Bunsou|Kitain the Serpent]], [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]]."<br>
Thus do children who love martial arts list famous historical martial artists, and "Takamine the Mistsplitter" was the very same user of this sword.<br>
This man once accompanied a member of the clergy, using the Mistsplitter to slay countless demons and [[Tatarigami]].<br>
He also learned archery from the [[Yougou Tengu]], and passed that knowledge on to [[Asase Hibiki|a person he loved]].<br>
However, Mistsplitter would have no successors, and now only exists within storybooks, artworks, and fairytales.

At the end of his life, he assumed the position of one of the Shogun's {{w|yoriki}} and fought against a [[cataclysm|dark army]].

If he hadn't left his [[Thundering Pulse|beloved bow]] to her as part of their wager, maybe things would've been different.<br>
But real gamblers never regret, never care about "what ifs," and never feel remorse over "if onlys."<br>
The foe flooded over like mist &mdash; and so he would just keep slashing away with that secret blade that could disperse the brumous night.<br>
As long as his strikes were swift enough, he would pierce the dark night, and day would come again&mdash;

"Asase, our promise... No, say rather our great bet. I will not lose it, not for the world!"<br>
"I shall return, and together with the bow that I'd wagered... I'll claim the future as my prize!"

Like a never-ending chain of lightning, he and Mistsplitter slew countless demons together.<br>
Yet at the last, the sword was not as tenacious as the swordsman, and it gradually broke down.<br>
And he became submerged in that thick dark mist...<br>
In the end, only some of the blade's fragments were retrieved for reforging, such that the resultant weapon might inherit the Mistsplitter name.

As though holding onto a spider's thread hanging down in the dark, the samurai held the handle of his broken sword tightly.<br>
Amidst the dark mist, he kept stubbornly reminding himself:<br>
The result of our wager is still undecided. I must return to Asase's side...
