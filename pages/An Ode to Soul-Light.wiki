==Text==
O Nagarjuna,<br />
Aided by the light of countless spirits, I bless this land of eternal calamity.<br />
When the sludge of the deepest depths of the abyss stained the first kingdom,<br />
The glorious spirits that aided the Lord of Wisdom dispersed a million ways.<br />
I crossed back over the River of Sorrow in my thirst for spring water.<br />
I opened a path for the benevolent spirits so that the merciful light of wisdom may illuminate the four corners.

O Nagarjuna,<br />
Aided by the light of numberless spirits, I nourish the benevolent spirits in the sea of flowers.<br />
Behold, the spirits' light reveals the essence of the spirit, the final descendant of the god of grass and trees.<br />
Behold, the warrior who remains after a hundred battles is the Devs' foe.<br />
Not even the inky gloom from beyond the skies can erode their forms.

O Nagarjuna,<br />
Aided by the light of a million spirits, I have transcended the dead of this foul earth.<br />
Cleanse the sinless of their sins, so that they may be reborn in a pure land free of suffering.<br />
In the chakras of the earth are contained the karmic seeds that will give birth to all things.<br />
The fleeting blights and glories of the earthly realm are naught but the illusion of existing seeds.

O Nagarjuna,<br />
Aided by the light of countless spirits, I have cleansed the abyss of heaven above.<br />
The sludge welling up from the depths of the abyss has finally receded,<br />
The legacy of Dahri, too, has submitted to the law.<br />
A thousand songs were sung in unison, and the heavy rains abated for a time.

O Nagarjuna,<br />
If [[The Withering|the dark tide]] reappears and the black abyss returns,<br />
Sing this hymn and pray for that prevailing light of the spirits.<br />
That eternal light of the spirits will guide us on our path upwards.
