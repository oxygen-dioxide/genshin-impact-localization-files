|description  = A large fish said to be the descendant of dragons.<br />With the horn on its head and its scaleless form clad as if in golden armor, it looks every bit like a king underwater. In truth, its bloodline and behavior could not be more different from that of a dragon &mdash; it can neither call forth the wind and rain nor the power of domination and is actually often the victim of food-snatching due to its weak character. A real shame, of course, that it looks so very majestic. As such, it lost the nickname "Descendant of Dragons," and is now termed the "False Dragon" instead.

==Trivia==
* The Golden Koi does not resemble the real-life {{w|koi}}, but resembles an Eastern dragon instead.
** The Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names of the Golden Koi all relate the fish to a dragon instead.
** Carp, which the Japanese call Koi, are said to transform into dragons after leaping the {{w|Longmen (mythology)|Longmen}}, a waterfall of the Yellow River in China. One Chinese name for Carp is therefore "false dragon", as this fish is named.
