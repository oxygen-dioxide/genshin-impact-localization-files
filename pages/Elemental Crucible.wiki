Work together with other Travelers to shovel Elemental Clots into the Elemental Crucible to advance the alchemical process. After the alchemical transmutation is completed, consume Original Resin to receive bounties, including Character EXP materials, Adventure EXP, and more. Bounties will be calculated based on each Traveler's individual World Level. You can also obtain rewards such as Primogems, Character Ascension materials, and more by completing achievements in the Alchemy Handbook.<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1315109866847887360 Official Announcement]</ref>

==Details==
The '''Elemental Crucible''' requires players to collect '''Elemental Clots''' and bring them into the vicinity of the Elemental Crucible, to which it will be absorbed by it and the progress bar at the top of the screen will advance. Players have 15 minutes to complete the entire progress bar.

Elemental Clots are charged [[elements|elemental]] particles that come in two sizes: Large and small. Large clots advance the Elemental Crucible's progress bar faster than smaller ones, and they appear after defeating larger enemies.

Collecting an Elemental Clot will cause the player to have the debuff of that element. Up to 3 of the same elements can be carried at once. The moment the player attempts to pick up an Elemental Clot of a different element, it will replace the old clot set.

'''Element Overloads''' can be triggered. Upon triggering, many large clots and small clots of a specific element will appear around the area. Two players will be inoculate for that specific element, able to deposit that element into the Crucible with greater efficiency. Enemies firing arrows that react with that element will attempt to stop the transporters from reaching the crucible (leaving the other two players to play defensive).

Upon completion of the Elemental Crucible, players can collect the treasure for '''40 [[Original Resin]]'''. For fun, each player is categorized based on their gameplay:
*'''Logistical Alchemist''' - Transport the most Elemental Clots of anyone on the team.
*'''Efficient Alchemist''' - Reach the highest alchemical efficiency of anyone on the team.
*'''Elemental Runner''' - Transport 10 Elemental Clots.
*'''Alchemic Trooper''' - Defeat 5 opponents during an alchemical transmutation.
*'''Alchemic Veteran''' - Defeat 10 opponents during an alchemical transmutation.
*'''Alchemic Warlock''' - Defeat 15 opponents during an alchemical transmutation.

==Requirements==
*Reach [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or higher.
*Complete all quests in Prologue: Act II - [[For a Tomorrow Without Tears]].
*Complete [[Timaeus]]'s quest [[One Giant Step for Alchemy?]].

==Rewards==
Each run/transmutation costs 40 [[Original Resin]].
