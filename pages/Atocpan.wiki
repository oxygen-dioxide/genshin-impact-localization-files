{{Readable|title=Damaged Bounty|
...[[Ixtelo|a lunatic]]... calling them "gems," and embedding them into...<br><!--
-->...many have already fallen victim... blasphemous acts...<br><!--
-->...tracked his movements... and will administer punishment...<br><br><!--
-->(Two notes were left in the blank space beneath the bounty notice, written in a different hand from the rest of the text.)<br><!--
-->...Sulferite. And such a rare, high-quality specimen at that...<br><!--
-->...as though [[liquid phlogiston]] flows within. If we can preserve it properly, this time, surely...}}

====Damaged Letter====
This interactable can be found at Ixtelo's campsite.
{{Readable|title=Damaged Letter|
...If you encounter... a solitary wanderer dressed in such attire, be sure to keep your distance...<br><!--
-->...In the past, we too... after returning from the Great Volcano of Tollan, succumbed to the allure of wicked sorcery of unknown origin...<br><!--
-->...seems to believe that these "gems" will free him from the fear of the boundless darkness he once witnessed...<br><!--
-->...gouged out by him... Remember, he is not someone to be bartered with...<br><!--
-->...after returning... take over from [[Soncoyoc]]...<br><!--
-->&mdash; [[Hawka]]}}

====Letter for Anna====
This interactable can be found in a boat at a [[Fatui]] camp east of the [[Derelict Masonry Dock]] [[Domain]].
{{Readable|title=Letter for Anna|
Dearest Anna. I've received your letter, and I know what's happening back at home.<br><!--
-->I'm sorry, but we've only just gotten our ancient ruin analysis on track, and I am required to help study the kuuvahki.<br><!--
-->Furthermore, the Lord [[Harbinger]] has specifically requested that I take charge of said research. This opportunity is hard to come by &mdash; I can't give it up.<br><!--
-->And while work here is exhausting, and I often clash with others, at least the researchers all respect me &mdash; more so than people do back home, at any rate.<br><br><!--
-->Of course, I'll be mindful of the business you've spoken of.<br><!--
-->I'll be careful when it comes to dealing with Warrant Officer Tatiana. Don't worry, this isn't the first time I've crossed the seas, you know? I'll be fine.<br><br><!--
-->As for the triangle problem you mentioned in your letter, I suspect that a gradual auxiliary line will lead you to the answer. The details of the method are as follows...}}

====The Book of Five Springs====
This interactable can be found at the cold onsen in the west.
{{Readable|title=The Book of Five Springs
|text=<!--
-->"What is defeat, really? Thus the man pondered ceaselessly... until a challenger approached, surging on the path of five searing springs!"<br><br><!--
-->"A showdown to decide who the 'strongest' is, a battle to 'sear' the 'sheer cold'! His surging, searing path shall cause even a mighty mountain to melt and boil!"<br><br><!--
-->"Yae Publishing House's latest flagship work, 'The Book of Five Springs' &mdash; now serialized in a store near you!"}}

====Unsigned Letter====
This interactable can be found at the large Fatui camp west of [[Remnants of Tetenanco]].
{{Readable|title=Unsigned Letter|
Tanya, I have heard that you wish to return to the homeland for a family reunion &mdash; a reasonable request, in my estimation.<br><!--
-->You have been here in Natlan for quite some years now, in any case, and it is hardly proper that you remain a Warrant Officer after all this. A promotion should be considered.<br><!--
-->However, while you have done your fair share, more may still be required.<br><!--
-->As such, I have arranged for you to take over the duty of guarding Madam Kovalevskaya. It would be well if you made the best of this opportunity.<br><!--
-->Of course, do not feel too pressured by this assignment.<br><!--
-->The situation is urgent, and the sea route perilous, while the dispatched vessel is quite old. No one could blame you for any mishaps that might occur during such a journey.<br><!--
-->Being blameless, therefore, you should do as you see fit.<br><!--
-->You have my backing, as surely as I have someone else's.<br><!--
-->I'm sure you can appreciate my meaning.<br><br><!--
-->Speaking of which, I visited your family recently.<br><!--
-->I've arranged for them to be taken care of, and they are doing well. In the meantime, simply focus on doing your duty.<br><br><!--
-->You have disappointed me quite a few times already. See that you seize this final chance you have been given.}}

====Warning Board====
This interactable can be found near the Teleport Waypoint south of the [[Wayward Hermetic Spiritspeaker]]. Picking the 3 [[Grainfruit]]s nearby causes an angry [[Tatankasaur]] to spawn.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Warning Board:''' (A message board covered in warnings written by tribe members...)
:'''Warning Board:''' "So someone hasn't had enough to eat lately, is that it? Who out there's hungry enough to steal from a Tatankasaurus?!"
:'''Warning Board:''' "You should know, our saurian has one meeeean temper. If you get caught stealing our Grainfruit, don't come crying to me after you've been trampled into a paste!"
{{Dialogue End}}

====Warning Notice====
This interactable can be found at the entrance of the "Tunnel Through the Mountain," just north of Remnants of Tetenanco.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Warning Notice:''' Due to the frequency of recent volcanic eruptions, the Remnants of the Secret Source excavation site is temporarily closed to the public!
{{Dialogue End}}
