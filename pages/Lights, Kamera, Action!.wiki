{{Quest Description|It's time you shot a film starring your Saurian companion!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with the Kamera)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, look, {{Traveler}}! There's a Kamera here, and some props too. D'you think this is a film set?
:'''Paimon:''' But these houses... they're so tiny. They make you look like a giant!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr... Rawrrr!
:{{DIcon}} Puny humans...
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawrrr...
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, looks like we're real "big" shots now, huh?
:{{DIcon}} This would make a great house for you, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Seriously, what are you on about? There's no way Paimon could live in such a small house. She couldn't even stretch her arms and legs out!
:{{Black Screen|Suddenly, yet utterly seamlessly, a Natlan local joins the conversation...}}
:'''Akatanga:''' Oh, hello! Are you guys interested in filmmaking too? If so, then I beseech you &mdash; join forces with me, Akatanga, to bring this burgeoning new trend to the lands of Natlan, that it might sweep all before it!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawr!
:'''Paimon:''' How come you're so hyped all of a sudden, {{Little One}}? Anyone'd think you were a film buff yourself, chiming in like that!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Raaaawrrr!
:'''Akatanga:''' You have a keen eye, little one! In truth, everything you see here was set up with the sole intention of making a certain little [[Tepetlisaur]] the next big star!
:'''Akatanga:''' A great pity that my friend took the little fellow away. We had an almighty spat over our creative differences, after which she stormed off with my most important actor... and now they are gone. *sigh*...
:'''Akatanga:''' I should never have mixed friends and business. The project failed, and I lost my friend too... In other words, I am doubly defeated.
:'''Akatanga:''' But that's all water under the bridge &mdash; for now, what stands before me but another little Tepetlisaur, starry-eyed and eager for stardom! With such enthusiasm, what could go wrong? We shall make the next big hit!
:'''Akatanga:''' So, what do you say? If you can help me complete this timeless, groundbreaking work of mine, I'll be sure to reward you handsomely!
:{{DIcon}} Well, seeing as {{Little One}} likes the idea...
:{{DIcon}} Hundred and ten percent sounds like some kind of scam.
::'''Akatanga:''' Even if it's not an overnight sensation, I'll still compensate you for helping out with the shoot. A win-win situation, no?
:'''Paimon:''' We can help, but... We still don't know what this film of yours is even about.
:'''Akatanga:''' Well, here's what I've got so far...
:{{Black Screen|*bzzt*&mdash; *bang* A sudden flash of dazzling white light heralds the arrival of an uninvited guest to the tribal settlement, perfectly round but for a single spike. *crackle* *bzzt* As it stops for a moment on the grass, a scorching smell begins to waft upon the air. "Eek! An emissary of Xibalba!" The tribesfolk look terrified when they see it. *bang* *crackle* *bzzt* "A foul abomination with no teeth... It's coming our way! It will surely devour us all!"}}
:{{Black Screen|Just as the wicked villain is about to break through the tribe's defenses... *BOOM* *BOOM* Our savior with the red tail scarf appears, seemingly out of nowhere. "Where did it come from?" the tribesfolk gasp, marveling at its sturdy claws, stronger than obsidian itself, and capable of carving through rock of any kind. "But faced with such a slippery, shameless foe... Surely even for {{Little One}}, this is a fight that cannot be w..."}}
:{{Black Screen|"Rawrrrr!" cries our savior &mdash; in more of a piercing shriek than an angry roar &mdash; and the evil, toothless monstrosity begins to pulsate. A raging blaze lights up the sky, followed by a thunderous rumbling... then waves of heat begin to flow forth, hotter even than [[liquid phlogiston]]. Immersed in such heat, the toothless fiend is vanquished. "Hot, hot, hot!" cry the tribesfolk, who have narrowly escaped disaster, as the aftershock surges through their ranks.}}
:{{Black Screen|But when they look up, they discover that their savior with the red tail scarf has vanished without a trace, as suddenly and inexplicably as it first arrived...}}
:'''Akatanga:''' Well, what do you think?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr rawr!
:{{DIcon}} It's amazing! That's exactly what I've been waiting to see.
::'''Akatanga:''' I knew it! I knew this kind of thing would appeal to someone!
:{{DIcon}} It's... unique? Bit hard to get my head around, if I'm honest...
::'''Akatanga:''' Ah, well... As an outsider once told me, if it stands out from the crowd, you're already on the winning path!
:'''Paimon:''' Umm, Paimon doesn't really get it, but as long as {{Little One}} likes it, that's all that really matters, right? So... What exactly do we actually have to do?
:'''Akatanga:''' It's very simple. First of all, you'll need to set out the performance props. {{Color|buzzword|Place the Wooden Barrel and the Elemental Bait somewhere suitable}}.
:'''Akatanga:''' The Wooden Barrel is your secret weapon, so you'd do well to place it {{Color|buzzword|in the middle of the scene}}, as long as it doesn't block the main character or the set buildings. It would be best if the Elemental Bait was near {{Color|buzzword|where the antagonist enters from}} &mdash; in other words, near the side.
:'''Akatanga:''' Once the actors are all here, it's time to get moving. {{Little One}}, our savior with the red tail scarf, makes their entrance!
:'''Akatanga:''' When the plot calls for it, the two of you must {{Color|buzzword|guide the antagonist towards the Wooden Barrel}}, then scram with equal haste. Once you've reached a safe position, simply {{Color|buzzword|smash the Wooden Barrel}}, and that's it, job done!
:'''Akatanga:''' I can't wait to see the film when it's finished!

;(Talk to Akatanga, optional)
:'''Akatanga:''' What's up? Need me to run you through it once more?
:{{DIcon}} Can you tell me what I have to do again?
::'''Akatanga:''' First, set out the performance props. Place the Wooden Barrel in the {{Color|buzzword|middle of the scene, without blocking the main character or the set}}, and place the Elemental Bait near {{Color|buzzword|where the antagonist enters from}}.
::'''Akatanga:''' When it's time to do so, {{Color|buzzword|guide the antagonist to a spot near the Wooden Barrel}}, then move back to a safe position and {{Color|buzzword|smash the Wooden Barrel}}.
:{{DIcon}} No need.
::'''Akatanga:''' Then best of luck, I'm counting on you!

;(Hint shown if quest navigation is used)
::Place the barrel in the center of the scene but without blocking the "protagonist's" position

;(Place the barrel incorrectly in the location in the front)
:'''Akatanga:''' Umm... Don't you think that's too close? There's gotta be a more suitable spot.
:'''Akatanga:''' It would be best if it's in the middle of the frame, but further away from the Kamera.

;(Place the barrel incorrectly in the location in the center)
:'''Akatanga:''' Not a bad choice... but not the most suitable this time!
:'''Akatanga:''' It would be best if it's in the middle of the frame, but further away from the Kamera.

;(Place the barrel incorrectly on the location on the right)
:'''Akatanga:''' This is an important item; we can't leave it out of the picture. Let's find another place for it.
:'''Akatanga:''' It would be best if it's in the middle of the frame, but further away from the Kamera.

;(Place the barrel in the correct position)
:'''Akatanga:''' Next up is the elemental bait. Place it where the antagonist appears, on the side of the frame...

;(Hint shown if quest navigation is used)
::Place the Elemental Bait near the side of the scene, where the "antagonist" will enter from

;(Place the elemental bait incorrectly in the location in the front)
:'''Akatanga:''' This.... this is one way to do it, I guess? No, let's try somewhere else.
:'''Akatanga:''' It'd be best if our antagonist first appears on one side of the frame.

;(Place the elemental bait incorrectly in the location in the center)
:'''Akatanga:''' Let's leave this spot for the star of our show, the little Tepetlisaur!
:'''Akatanga:''' It'd be best if our antagonist first appears on one side of the frame.

;(Place the elemental bait in the correct position)
:'''Akatanga:''' Good, very good. This spot is perfect.

;(Talk to Akatanga)
:'''Akatanga:''' When the actors are in position, the two of you must {{Color|buzzword|guide the antagonist towards the Wooden Barrel}} as planned, then scram with equal haste. Once you've reached a safe position, simply {{Color|buzzword|smash the Wooden Barrel}}.

;(When [[Little One]] gets into position)
:'''Akatanga:''' Oh! Looks like our main character is already in position!

;(Interact with the elemental bait)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Why's a temp suddenly filling in as the antagonist? Nobody ran it by us!
:'''Akatanga:''' Shh! Quiet, we're about to start shooting!
:'''Narration:''' "No, such evil cannot be forgiven... rest in peace, my friends. Oh, the agony... Seeing the fallen brothers of the tribe, how can one not be moved to tears?"
:'''Narration:''' "But now is not the time for tears. Today, I face the all-{{Rubi|scorching|Xolotl}} emissary, and come what may, I shall have my revenge&mdash;"
:'''[[Electro Slime]]:''' ?
:'''Narration:''' A ferocious, toothless beast whose demeanor is as cool and composed as a [[Lavender Melon]], that legendary fruit from far across the sea!
:'''Narration:''' What sort of a face was it, I hear you ask? A visage of such merciless cruelty that even gulping down volcanically spicy [[Tatacos]] would leave it unmoved. Truly terrifying...
:'''Narration:''' "This time, this time your remorse shall be great indeed!" And with that, the giant beast with the red tail scarf unleashed the Mighty Meaty Fireball it had honed through countless hours of practice...
:'''Akatanga:''' Alright, now's the time! Lure the Electro Slime towards the Wooden Barrel, then smash it to smithereens!
:'''Paimon:''' What, just smash a barrel? How's that gonna make anyone buy this whole "Mighty Meaty Fireball" business?
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds kinda weird, but... If you say so, we'll give it a try.

;(If the barrel is destroyed before the Electro Slime gets to it)
:'''Akatanga:''' Ah, just a bit more... Wait until the antagonist is near the barrel...
:;(Continues to failed movie shoot line)

;(If the Electro Slime is killed)
:'''Akatanga:''' Hey, the antagonist exited the stage too early! That won't do.
:;(Continues to failed movie shoot line)

;(If the movie shoot fails)
:'''Akatanga:''' No, that won't do. It didn't turn out how I imagined at all... Let's start over.
:;(The scene is reset)

;(Destroy the barrel while the Electro Slime is nearby)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawrrr!
:'''Paimon:''' Steady on, no need to rush!
:'''Akatanga:''' To tell you the truth, I was just a teeny-tiny bit worried for the little one just now. I wanted the effect to be as realistic as possible, so I might have gone a bit overboard on the explosives...
:{{DIcon}} Nearly blew the whole settlement sky high...
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawrawrawrawrawr...
:{{DIcon}} Even for me, that felt a bit too dangerous.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! What if someone got hurt, or there was a fire or something?
:'''Akatanga:''' In any case, with this experience to go on, I'll know how to do things better next time. Thank you all for your help. Now, how about we take a look at how it turned out?
:{{Black Screen|To all of your surprise, neither the savior with the red tail scarf, nor the evil crackling antagonist, nor the thrilling shots of explosions seem to have made it into the final cut &mdash; only close-ups of Akatanga's constantly changing expressions...}}
:'''Akatanga:''' I... I'm the star of the show?
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations!
::'''Paimon:''' No, no, that's not right! Could it be that the Kamera...
:{{DIcon}} Have you... used a Kamera before?
:'''Akatanga:''' Well, it's true that this is the first time I've ever officially used a Kamera, but... Surely I didn't... get it the wrong way round?
:'''Paimon:''' Easy for you to say, but what about all that hard work we just put in?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wooo... Rrrooo... Rrawrr...
:'''Paimon:''' And {{Little One}} was so looking forward to seeing it...
:'''Akatanga:''' I'm so sorry, it's all my fault! Alright, how about this... Just think of the previous events as a rehearsal. We'll do it again, and this time, it'll be the real deal. I'll do my absolute best, and everything possible, to shoot the best film I can possibly shoot!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrooo... Rawrrrr!
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like you're eager to give this another shot, huh, {{Little One}}? Let's do it, then. Hope nothing goes wrong this time...
:{{Black Screen|You follow the same process as before and finally get the result you wanted...}}
:'''Akatanga:''' Incredible! Absolute perfection! That completely and utterly exceeded my expectations.
:{{DIcon}} A complete, utter, absolute... piece of cake.
:{{DIcon}} Director, where's that bonus you promised us?
:'''Akatanga:''' Aside from the payment we agreed upon, I'll also give you this picture to keep as a souvenir. *sigh* I must say, this really has turned out to be my magnum opus. Of course, I couldn't have done it without your help.

:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, you look so imposing, {{Little One}}! Not bad at all.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawrrr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, looks like {{Little One}} is happy with how it turned out too. Well, all's well that ends well, as they say!
:;(Quest completes)

;(Talk to Akatanga again, optional)
:'''Akatanga:''' Who knows, perhaps that friend of mine might even have a change of heart once she sees this... Haha.
