{{Description|A water pouch used by the Viridescent Venerer. Its capacity is much greater than one would expect.}}
'''Viridescent Venerer's Vessel''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Viridescent Venerer]].

==Description==
A very robust and leakproof vessel.<br />A legendary hunter known as the Viridescent Venerer once used it to collect whispers by the campfire.

One night, the Viridescent Venerer picked up the scent of other human beings.<br />As a hunter, she feared neither wolf packs nor monsters.<br />What she feared far more than this was joining the chatter by the campfire.<br />For she had long forgotten how to speak human language.

Even after rejoining the humans and accepting her place as Viridescent Venerer, no one ever heard her say a single word.<br />Similarly, no one ever saw her leave a single trace behind.

The Viridescent Venerer collected the laughter she heard that night and stored it in her vessel.<br />For many years, she would listen back to the voices in the vessel whenever she felt lonely.
