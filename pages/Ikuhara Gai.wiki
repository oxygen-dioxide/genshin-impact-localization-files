==Profile==
Ikuhara Gai invented the Ikuhara Art forging technique. He was originally a swordsmith at [[Tatarasuna]], but an accident with the [[Mikage Furnace]] caused him to leave. Since he doesn't want to leave forever, he joined the [[Shogun's Army]] as a blacksmith so he can observe the situation in Tatarasuna from afar.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ikuhara Gai:''' *sigh* Just look at this. How can you make a great sword from this scrap? This is an utter waste of my Ikuhara Art forging techniques!
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Ikuhara Gai knows; Version 1)
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Lately, some soldiers came over to tell me that they found some areas nearby from which ore can be mined, and that they even saw some rare Magical Crystal Ores.
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' As for those, well... Magical Crystal Ores are pretty high-quality stuff, alright. But it's hard to make weapons from them, so they're of little use to me.
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' I'd put them as having been around here, and I'll help you mark them out. Go check them out if you're interested.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Ikuhara Gai knows; Version 2)
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Some troops told me recently that there are some ore mining veins around here.
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' That said, though, I'm not really convinced of the quality of anything that isn't Jade Steel.
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' I'd put them as having been around here, and I'll help you mark them out. Go check them out if you're interested.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Ikuhara Gai knows)
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' This is a military camp, what's there that isn't noteworthy?
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Still, it's been relatively peaceful around these parts lately &mdash; no real flare ups and all. I hope it stays that way...
:{{DIcon}} What's the Ikuhara Art?
::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' The Ikuhara Art is a newly-founded forging style. Our founder... Well, you're looking at him!
::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' I used to be a swordsmith at Tatarasuna. Then an accident occurred at the Mikage Furnace. Many of my colleagues have since left.
::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' I don't want to leave yet. That's why I joined the Shogun's Army stationed here. I can serve the Shogunate while observing the situation in Tatarasuna.
::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' After all, the best sword-forging material, [[Jade Steel]], is produced here in Tatarasuna... If you don't have good materials to use as a basis, then no amount of skill will make it easy for you to forge the finest blades.
::{{DIcon}} Do you really have to use Jade Steel from Tatarasuna?
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Hey, are you listening to yourself? ...Forget it, you're an outlander. You wouldn't understand.
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' The reason why swords from Inazuma are so famous is because of Jade Steel. Swords {{sic|forged it}} are tough and durable, yet extremely sharp.
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Many samurai and swordsmen in our history made their names using weapons forged from Jade Steel.
:::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Someday, I will use the finest Jade Steel and the forging techniques of the Ikuhara Art to create the best sword in the world!
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} I hope you succeed.
::::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Thank you for your kind words. I won't give up.
::::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Recently, I collected some decent ores. There were some leftovers, so if you need them, feel free to take them.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|White Iron Chunk|20|x=5}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ikuhara Gai:''' Goodbye. I'd better go find some proper materials.
