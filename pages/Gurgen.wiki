==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Gurgen:''' Hello, do you need medicinal herbs?
:{{DIcon}} Medicinal herbs?
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
::'''Gurgen:''' My father was a herb farmer. After I survived a shipwreck, I came home to help grow herbs.
::'''Gurgen:''' I was unable to go to sea due to the aftereffects of that shipwreck, so I reapplied for knowledge on growing herbs from the Akasha Terminal.
::'''Gurgen:''' I survived only because of the immediate first aid. It was natural for me to support my father when he decided to provide herbs for Bimarstan for free.
::'''Gurgen:''' If possible, I want to pass the examination to study medicine at the Akademiya.

::'''Gurgen:''' I survived only because of the immediate first aid I was given, so it was natural for me to support my father when he decided to provide herbs to Bimarstan for free.
::'''Gurgen:''' I won't be able to go out to sea ever again, but if I can, I'd like to go to [[Pardis Dhyai]].
::'''Gurgen:''' I've heard that a lot of talks there have gone public. Who knows, a bit of herb lore there and an exam here, and you'll see me next at the Akademiya studying the medical sciences!
:{{DIcon}} I'm good, thanks.
::'''Gurgen:''' Alright. I'm here if you need me for anything. Feel free to ask.
