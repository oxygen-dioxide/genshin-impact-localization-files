|description = Prank-prone rascals with a slim and agile form.<br>They are named Boot Weasels due to their four limbs, which are covered in dark-colored fur. These creatures are a bit more frightened and cautious than other weasel species, and their tiptoeing movements have only deepened the impression of them as "weasels in boots." As such, all sorts of strange legends circulate around Teyvat concerning these thieving little creatures.
