|description = This large bird consumes remains, and its red feathers often seem a little sparse under the sunlight.<br>These members of the eagle family are not actually native to the desert, instead appearing in the desert after the disappearance of the ancient civilization ruled by [[King Deshret]]. They have also come to be seen as harbingers of death or disaster by some migrants from the desert due to their unique living habits.
