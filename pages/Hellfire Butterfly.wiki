|description  = A warped shard that houses great might. You obtained this from defeating [[Signora]], who unleashed her original power.<br />The seal of ice was broken under duress, and as her former will surged forth from its pale white prison and she remembered her [[Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter|old name]] once more, the undying butterfly danced amidst burning flesh and blood. And she remembered her past, wandering the land, spreading the flame, burning away all evil &mdash; and she recalled the face of the [[Rostam|person]] she could never meet again.
