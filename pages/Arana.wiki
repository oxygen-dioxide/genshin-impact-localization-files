==Profile==
At some point, Arana befriended [[Rana]], but appeared to forget about her.

When [[Iotham]] was lured by the [[Fatui]] into a [[The Withering|Withering Zone]] as part of their plan to lure and capture an [[Aranara]], Arana saw him in danger and used her Ararakalari to seal him in a protective bubble for the time being. The [[Traveler]] and [[Rana]], who saw Iotham, went into the cave to rescue him, although Rana, who lacked a [[Vision]], was severely corroded by the Withering's effects.

As the Traveler brought Iotham back to the village, Arana saw Rana and bubbled her to protect her from Marana's corrosion before taking her to Arana's home. The Traveler, who then returned to the cave, followed the tracks to Arana's home and encountered her. Learning of the situation, Arana told them that they would need a [[Bija]] fruit to save her and told them how to meet with the rest of her kind at [[Vanarana]].

The Traveler's journey to Vanarana culminated with the destruction of [[Marana's Avatar]]. Arana was brought to Old Vanarana by [[Arama]] and forfeited her memories to the newly grown Ashvattha Tree, causing her to forget its memories of the Traveler. However, upon seeing the tree, she understood what happened and returned to her home, where she met Rana and befriended her again. Arana then decided to go on a journey with Rana.
