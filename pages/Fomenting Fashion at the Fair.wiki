Shops and stalls of all colors stand shoulder to shoulder, decked out in graffiti and decorations that lend the scene a style and a vital glow unique to [[Natlan]].<br>Ornaments and paints in rainbow hues are the calling cards of Natlan's markets and the common currency for those who wish to express their affinity with the latest trends. It would be no overstatement to say that countless new fashions are birthed in the stands and stalls of markets like this all over Natlan.
