'''Mistcloud Stage''' is [[Yun Jin]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Yun Jin's clothing consists of a puffy, long-sleeved, knee-length dark purple dress with a white underskirt. Layered above her underskirt is a dark purple overskirt divided in the middle, split into five sections. Her dress has a white mandarin collar fastened with a red cloverleaf knot, as well as a detailed black corset-like belt studded with gold. Her Geo Vision is pinned on the left side of her cape and a gold geometric symbol of unknown origin on her right. Her legwear consists of translucent lavender tights and a pair of knee-high, lace-up, dark purple boots.

Yun Jin's most prominent accessory is a large dark purple hat inspired by traditional Chinese opera headwear. The underside of the hat has a white base with fluffy pom-poms in various sizes sewn to it, ranging from pink to bright turquoise to white. At the back of the hat are two turquoise, braid-like tassels slightly longer than Yun Jin's hair.
