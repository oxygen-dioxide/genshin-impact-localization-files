|description = The [[Lord of Flowers]] was in an amicable relationship with the [[Jinn]].<br>The Mistress of Flowers and Oases joined hands with the [[Lord of Deserts]] and built [[Ay-Khanoum]], the "City of Amphitheaters," which carried the meaning of "City of the Moon Maiden" in the ancient language of the Jinn.<br>Later, however, it was said that the Lord of Flowers died due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand, after which the blossoms of purple [[Padisarah]]s were never seen again in the oases.<br>After the departure of the Lord of Flowers, the sandstorms keened, the Jinn sobbed, and the moonlight-silver gem disc lost its original, glad purpose, giving off a mournful glimmer.
