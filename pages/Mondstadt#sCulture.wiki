{{RegionTabs}}
The nation of [[Mondstadt]] is marked by its adherence to "freedom," [[Barbatos]]' ideal.

==Life in Mondstadt==
Overall, Mondstadt has a casual, laid-back atmosphere derived from their belief in freedom over all else. There has been little socioeconomic stratification ever since the dissolution of the aristocracy 1000 years ago, although certain families such as the [[Gunnhildr Clan]] and the [[Ragnvindr Family]] enjoy a good reputation due to their long lineages and notable contributions to Mondstadt.

Alcohol plays a major role in Mondstadt both socially and economically. As a result, Mondstadt has a large drinking culture, which in turn has led to a relatively high amount of alcoholics. [[Nimrod]] talks about the "[[Four Drunkards]]," who are allegedly the biggest drinkers in Mondstadt,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Nimrod}}</ref> though he himself is a relapsing alcoholic; this has earned him the consternation of his wife [[Eury]] and his confessor Sister [[Victoria]], and [[Charles]] has to contact Eury whenever his drinking gets out-of-hand.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Presumption of Innocence}}</ref> [[Diona]]'s hatred of alcohol stems from her father [[Draff]]'s personality change whenever he is drunk,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona|2}}</ref> though she fails to recognize that it is a direct response to his drinking habits.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Draff}}</ref>

After [[Grace]] received several complaints from children about drunk fathers stumbling out of wardrobes, the [[Church of Favonius]] now sends deaconesses to pray over newly built wardrobes to ward off such incidents.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Large Birch Wardrobe}}</ref> However, beyond hearing confessions and making prayers, the Church of Favonius seems to have little ability to address the real source of the problem, much to the frustration of confessors like Sister Victoria.

===Agriculture===
Under Barbatos' blessing, most of Mondstadt has a gentle climate that allows crops to flourish. Fresh fruits such as [[sunsettia]]s and [[apple]]s are abundant, as well as grapes for making wine. Of the wineries in Mondstadt, the [[Dawn Winery]] is one of the oldest and most influential, with over a thousand years of history.

Common crops such as [[carrot]]s and [[radish]]es can be found growing in small vegetable gardens in [[Springvale]] and the Dawn Winery. While they are not actively raised, [[Philanemo Mushroom]]s can be also found abundantly within the residential areas of Mondstadt and have been incorporated into Mondstadters' diets.

While cows themselves have not been seen in-game, the icon and description for [[milk]] indicate that milk cows exist in Mondstadt.

===Architecture===
Much of the City of Mondstadt is constructed in {{w|Gothic architecture|Gothic style}} and {{w|Timber_framing#German_tradition_(Fachwerkhäuser)|Fachwerk}} (timberframing).

Outside of the city, most towns and villages have smaller houses that are designed in a more traditional style, such as the [[Classic Country Home]]. While fireplaces are no longer needed in Mondstadt due to its constantly-moderate climate,<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Classic Country Home}}</ref> housing styles do not seem to have changed much. Thanks to the shorter height of the houses there, [[Springvale]] is often used as a practice ground for people learning how to use [[Wind Glider]]s.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Amber|Idyllic Town}}</ref>

===Education===
It appears that most people are tutored for general education, and people may choose to enter a certain trade and become apprenticed to a master for further instruction, like how [[Schulz]] is apprenticed to [[Wagner]] and how [[Sucrose]] and [[Timaeus]] are assistants for [[Albedo]] to learn more about alchemy. The literacy rate in Mondstadt appears to be quite high, as no Mondstadt NPCs are illiterate like there are in the neighboring nation of [[Liyue]].<ref group="Note">Both [[Lan]] and [[Ren'yu]] are explicitly stated to be illiterate or have low literacy skills, indicating that people from lower socioeconomic classes in Liyue might not receive any formal education.</ref> The only known Mondstadt character in present-day who is illiterate is [[Razor]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait}}</ref> who grew up with the wolves of Wolvendom.

The [[Mondstadt Library]] was once the largest library in the northern half of Teyvat. However, after most of the library burned down during the Great Fire of Fall Equinox at an unknown point in the past, it was reduced to one-sixth of its original size.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Codex}}</ref>

Prior to Albedo's arrival to Mondstadt, Mondstadters thought little of alchemy, believing it to be nothing more than "putting broken odds and ends" together.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Albedo|Character Details}}</ref> Their views have changed since then, with Timaeus promoting alchemy's benefits to the people of Mondstadt.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Category:Mondstadt Dishes}}
True to Mondstadt's reputation as the nation of wine and song, alcohol comprises a defining part of Mondstadt cuisine. As a result, ingredients used in alcohol production (such as [[apple]]s) are often featured in their dishes. Mondstadt's notable dishes include [[Moon Pie]], [["Pile 'Em Up"]], [[Mondstadt Grilled Fish]], and [[Mondstadt Hash Brown]]s. Dandelion wine is their most famous beverage, followed by both alcoholic and non-alcoholic [[Apple Cider|apple cider]].

[[Milk]], [[butter]], [[cheese]], and [[cream]] are commonly used in Mondstadt dishes, which suggests they have {{w|dairy cattle}} and by extension a dairy industry, although cattle cannot be found in-game. Befitting the "Land of Pastorals," six out of eight of the nation's [[Local Specialties#Mondstadt|local specialties]] are known to be edible,<ref group="Note">[[Calla Lily]] and [[Small Lamp Grass]] are used in in-game recipes. Xiangling mentions eating [[Valberry|valberries]] in her [[Xiangling/Lore#Xiangling's Map|character stories]], dandelions are used to make dandelion wine, and Grace prepares Mondstadt Hash Browns with [[Philanemo Mushroom]]s for Timmie in [[Sorry, Timmie!]]</ref> while the two that have no currently known culinary use ([[Cecilia]]s and [[Windwheel Aster]]s) are likely edible as well.

Mondstadt's alcohol industry comprises a wide array of alcoholic beverages. In addition to grape wines, hard ciders made of apple and cherry have been mentioned,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Patton}}</ref> beer {{w|Tankard|tankards}} can be found in [[Angel's Share]], and jagerschnapps (a portmanteau of the real-life {{w|Jägermeister}} and {{w|schnapps}}) have also been mentioned.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Pigeons Go AWOL|quote='''Draff:''' Well, I suppose they are getting plump, and would probably make a great pairing with a glass of jagerschnapps...}}</ref> Mondstadt's most famous alcoholic product is [[Dandelion Seed|dandelion]] wine, which is similar to {{w|absinthe}} in strength.<ref group="Note">In the [[Teyvat Food Notes]], which publishes real-life recipes for in-game dishes, absinthe is used as a substitute for dandelion wine. Real-life {{w|Fruit wine#Dandelion wine|dandelion wine}} is typically of moderate alcohol content.</ref>

In more recent times, at [[Diluc]]'s request, the [[Dawn Winery]] has been expanding their repertoire to non-alcoholic drinks, such as non-alcoholic apple cider and grape juice. The former has proven to be a big hit, with monthly sales on par with that of dandelion wine.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|Dawn Winery's Apple Cider}}</ref>

===Music===
Lyres play a prominent part in Mondstadt's traditional music, dating back to [[Decarabian]]'s era. During that time, lyres were much larger and stood on the floor, much like a {{w|harp}}.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Classical Lyre: Tenor of the Wind}}</ref>

Thanks to [[Alice]]'s influence, Mondstadt has begun developing an idol subculture through [[Barbara]].<ref>{{Ref/CS|Barbara|Alice's Idol Magazine}}</ref>

==Designs, Motifs, and Symbols==
{{See also|Symbols in Teyvat}}
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are largely exclusive to the Mondstadt region or Mondstadt-affiliated parties.

===Character Cards===
Mondstadt Character Cards contain a large circle inlaid with a smaller circle aligned towards the bottom of the larger circle. At the top center of the large circle is the Mondstadt [[Vision]] symbol, with the character's element inlaid inside it. Five icons can be found to each side of the Vision, growing smaller in size as the space between the large and smaller circles decreases.

The bottom three icons on both sides are identical: the bottom is a dandelion leaf, above it is a dandelion flower, and above that is a [[Windwheel Aster]]. The remaining four icons each represent one of the [[Four Winds]]: the Falcon of the West (bottom left), the Wolf of the North (top left), the Lion of the South (top right), and the Dragon of the East (bottom right).

===Old Mondstadt Symbol===
The '''Old Mondstadt symbol''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a prominent design related to Mondstadt's history, whether under [[Decarabian]]'s reign or the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy|aristocracy]]. Its general form can be recognized as a pair of outstretched wings with a tail at the bottom. Several variations exist, and which is the original version or what it symbolized is unknown.

The most prominent version can be found on the weapon ascension materials related to Decarabian, on the [[Royal Series]] weapons, and on the [[Noblesse Oblige]] artifact set. It has two "feathers" per wing, with two shorter protrusions along the top of the wings. The tail have two inward-pointing "feathers" that form a diamond out of negative space.

The [[Anemo]] symbol is another version of the Old Mondstadt symbol, in which the two protrusions at the top are converted into a third set of feathers on the wings. Furthermore, the tail forms a triangle with white space instead of negative space, and the inward-pointing feathers along the tail no longer exist.

The [[Lawrence Clan]]'s '''Glacial Seal''' is another version and can be seen on [[Eula]]'s talent symbols, namecard, and idle animation.

===Decarabian's Cercelée===
{{See also|Decarabian's Mondstadt#Architecture and Design}}
Decarabian's {{w|cercelée}} is a cross with two rounded-in curls on each end. It is seen as a design motif on walls and pillars within [[Stormterror's Lair]], as well as on some ruins related to Decarabian located outside of the city.

<gallery captionalign="center">

===Knights of Favonius Crest===
Two versions of the '''Knights of Favonius crest''' exist. One can be seen on the shields within the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters]], while the other version can be seen on the Knights of Favonius uniforms, with the current exception of [[Kaeya]]. They are typically placed on the breastplate for standard uniforms, or along the midsection of custom uniforms.

The version seen on shields appears to be a truncated version of the full version seen on uniforms. The entire bottom portion is missing, while the bottom part of the top portion has been shifted upwards, taking up the negative space present in the full version.

===Church of Favonius Symbol===
This symbol is displayed on the headwear of those affiliated with the [[Church of Favonius]] (with the notable exception of [[Rosaria]]). It seems to be a variant on the {{w|fleur-de-lis}} with an emphasis on wide, downward curving 'wings'. It bears passing resemblance to both the Anemo symbol and the Christian cross.

==Economy==
Mondstadt's economy largely revolves the production and export of alcohol. The [[Dawn Winery]] is Mondstadt's finest purveyor of alcoholic drinks and is the undisputed leader of Mondstadt's alcohol industry. Dawn Winery is also a leader in the alcohol industry in all of Teyvat, and merchants and businesses from other nations have tried to gain understanding, both honestly and dishonestly, about the methods that lead to the high quality of the alcohol from Dawn Winery, especially its signature Dandelion Wine.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wine, With a Taste of Freedom}}</ref> In addition, merchants from Liyue purchase alcohol from Mondstadt and resell it to the rest of Teyvat, both legitimately as trade unions who import Mondstadt's alcohol<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Patton}}</ref> and not so legitimately as individual merchants.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Hulu}}</ref>

==Fashion==
Mondstadt fashion is generally inspired by {{w|tracht}}, the traditional garments in German-speaking regions.

===Men's Fashion===
<gallery captionalign="center">
NPC Timmie.png|Male children's attire<br />([[Timmie]])
NPC Anthony.png|Men's attire, version 1<br />([[Anthony]])
NPC Stevens.png|Men's attire, version 2<br />([[Stevens]])

NPC Jotun.png|Men's attire, version 5<br />([[Jotun]])
NPC Tunner.png|Elderly men's attire<br />([[Tunner]])
</gallery>

Boys in Mondstadt wear short-sleeved tunics with short vests, as well as short trousers similar to {{w|lederhosen}}. Men tend to wear wide trousers tucked into tall boots.

===Women's Fashion===
<gallery captionalign="center">
NPC Flora.png|Female children's attire ([[Flora]])
NPC Eury.png|Women's attire, version 1 ([[Eury]])
NPC Vile.png|Women's attire, version 2 ([[Vile]])
NPC Marjorie.png|Women's attire, version 3 ([[Marjorie]])
NPC Troubled Lianne.png|Women's attire, version 4 ([[Troubled Lianne]])
</gallery>

Girls' attire and the fourth version of women's attire are more obviously based on the {{w|dirndl}}, a type of Germanic folk costume. The girls' costume typically comes in pink (like [[Flora]]'s) or blue (like [[Tia]]'s). The women's dirndl is usually seen in red ([[Margaret]]), orange ([[Myrana]]), or blue ([[Donna]]).

The first and second versions of women's attire are similar besides the blouse and bodice (or lack thereof, in the second version's case). Besides that, they have the same type of detached sleeve, bloomers, and short boots. The first version has three main color schemes: white and blue ([[Ellin]]), white and green ([[Anna]]), or light brown and dark brown ([[Dr. Livingstone]]).

The third version of women's attire features a double breasted jacket with puff sleeves over a knee-length dress. It comes in two colors: a gray jacket with a blue dress and short gloves ([[Marjorie]], [[Dr. Edith]], and [[Freki]]), or a purple/black jacket with a white dress and long gloves ([[Patchi the Curious]] and [[Esther]]). Notably, the second version has only been used on researchers; whether this is coincidence, or if they are part of a research organization, is unknown.

===Bard's Clothing===
<gallery captionalign="center">
NPC Alfred.png|Male bard attire<br />([[Alfred]])
NPC Sansa.png|Female bard attire<br />([[Sansa]])
</gallery>

Currently, only one clothing style exists for each gender. Men wear a white-and-green striped shirt underneath a green jacket, with green pants, white boots, and a green cravat. Women wear a white blouse and brown skirt covered by a red dress.

===Maid Uniforms===
<gallery captionalign="center">
NPC Adelinde.png|Maid attire, version 1<br />([[Adelinde]])
NPC Hillie.png|Maid attire, version 2<br />([[Hillie]])
</gallery>

Mondstadt's maid uniforms are unique to the region and have their appreciators in neighboring countries. [[Master Hui]] obtained such uniforms for his servant [[Xi the Maid]] to wear, something that she explains as a "curious hobby of his."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Xi the Maid}}</ref>

===Church of Favonius Habits===
<gallery captionalign="center">
NPC Grace.png|Black Church of Favonius habit<br />([[Grace]])
NPC Vind.png|White Church of Favonius habit<br />([[Vind]])
</gallery>

There are two main versions of the Church of Favonius habit worn by sisters of the order. One is black, which seems to be the more common form, while the white version has so far only been seen on [[Vind]] and [[Jilliana]]. It is currently unknown whether these colors represent their status in the church.

While there are men in the Church of Favonius, such as the current Seneschal [[Seamus Pegg]] and his substitute, [[Cardinal Calvin]], there are currently no male Church of Favonius NPCs in the game so the designs for their habits are unknown.

===Knights of Favonius Uniforms===
<gallery captionalign="center">
NPC Swan.png|Men's Uniform 1 - Plain<br />([[Swan]])
NPC Lawrence.png|Men's Uniform 2 - Brass<br />([[Lawrence]])
NPC Hertha.png|Women's Uniform<br />([[Hertha]])
</gallery>
The standard men's uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt, horse riding pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads. The white plate armor the Knights wear have two variations of their appearance: brass-accented and plain. Wing motifs decorate various parts of the armor and the Knights of Favonius crest is seen on the breastplate.

The standard women's uniform consists of a black long-sleeved shirt, tight-fitting pants, and gray knee-length skirt with white plate armor worn on top. Unlike men, the women do not wear poleyns to cover the knees and only have greaves on their legs.

Not all Knights have a sword. For those who do, men keep their swords sheathed and hung from their belt at their left side while women's swords are on their right side. Only a few Knights are known to keep a blowing horn on their person. The sword used by the Knights resembles the shape of the [[Traveler's Handy Sword]].

==Festivals and Holidays==
===Windblume Festival===
{{main|Windblume Festival}}
The Windblume Festival is a celebration of love and friendship. Much of the festival revolves around the titular Windblume, a flower which was said to have been used as a symbol of freedom and resistance during [[Decarabian]]'s era. Over the ages, the nature of the Windblume has been lost, and so which flower found throughout Mondstadt is the "real" Windblume is a subject of popular debate during the festival.

===Ludi Harpastum===
{{main|Ludi Harpastum}}
Ludi Harpastum is a fifteen-day festival filled with food, games, and music, intended to commemorate how Barbatos taught his people to brew wine and live freely. The champion of the games gets to choose a maiden, who will throw the Harpastum &mdash; a ball wrapped in red cloth &mdash; at the end of the festival. Whoever picks up the ball is said to enjoy good fortune for a year.

==Languages==
For the most part, Mondstadt predominantly uses the [[Teyvat Language|common language]], with some signs using [[Languages#Mondstadt Language|another language]].

The letters of the common language appear to be a mirrored and broken up version of Fraktur, a font that was typical for medieval Germany and that was still in use up until the early 20th century. The secondary language appears to be a simpler, reversed form of the Roman alphabet.

While the common language uses the aforementioned historic German font, all texts are written in English. German is less commonly used for names and titles, such as [[Venti]]'s lyre [[Venti/Lore#Vision|Der Himmel]]<ref>Manga, [https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/genshin-impact/prologue-songs-of-the-wind-part-2/viewer?title_no=242646&episode_no=2 Prologue: Songs of the Wind (Part 2)]:<br />'''Venti:''' Here is my partner, a lyre I call ''Der Himmel'', or The Heavens in the common tongue.</ref> or in [[Fischl]]'s chosen name Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort. However, German has not been seen in written form in the game world and so it is unknown whether it uses a different writing system from the common language.

==Politics==
Before [[Vennessa]]'s rebellion, the [[Lawrence Clan]] were the ones who governed Mondstadt. While they initially ruled just, they eventually became corrupted by greed and arrogance, ruling the country with an iron fist.

After her rebellion, the clan was thrown out and the [[Knights of Favonius]] were established to replace them. While they are not an explicit ruling entity per Barbatos' request to let the people live in freedom, they are still seen by other organizations such as the [[Liyue Qixing]] and [[Fatui]] as the ruling party. The Knights of Favonius are mostly based in the city of Mondstadt, but are known to patrol the entire country and resolve disputes and other threats.

==Travel Highlights==
The [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/town/mondstadt?noteId=1335 Teyvat Travel Highlights] are a series of publications by the [[Adventurers' Guild]], posted on the ''Genshin Impact'' official website. Their author is unknown.

===First Visit to Mondstadt===
The City of Freedom, the Crown of the North, the Romantic City of Pastorals &mdash; these are names heralded by poets and artists alike for the renowned city of Mondstadt.

I am devoted to poetry, music, wine, and festivities as much as the next bard; they are literally and metaphorically the sustenance of my life. Therefore, just as any bard would be, I am drawn to Mondstadt like a moth to a flame.

What caught my attention recently was the sightings of [[Dvalin|a dragon]] near Mondstadt. This has had the city folk wrapped in rumors and speculations, myself included. Maybe my curiosity got the better of me, or perhaps I too have the blood of an adventurer inside of me, for I am determined to venture forth to the City of Freedom that I have yearned for so long.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - First Visit to Mondstadt 1.jpg|300px]]

I took the route inland, for I very much prefer the company of changing terrains and mountains to the eternal blue. Traversing the treacherous Wolvendom took additional time, but I finally reached the Whispering Woods on the outskirts of Mondstadt four weeks ago. As its name would suggest, the sound of the wind caressing the leaves was like whispers in the woods. Could it be a gracious gift from the legendary bard, Barbatos the Anemo Archon, who the people of Mondstadt worship?

It is close to summer at this time of the year, and the temperate climate across the region is evident: Starfell Plains exhibits great vitality in the spring breeze. The trails and roads have sprung to life with flourishing flora, like Lamp Grass and Sweet Flowers.

Encounters with members of the Adventurers' Guild are frequent. They are likely brought here by the rumors of the dragon as well. I am much obliged to them, with them present my journey has been unperilous.

The vistas of the plains are invigorating. My first time camping out in the wilds also proved to be quite an experience, short-lived as it was, for I reached the gates of Mondstadt the following day.

The clear water from Cider Lake flows into the city through the ancient irrigation ditches, converging at the great fountain situated in the center of the plaza.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - First Visit to Mondstadt 2.jpg|300px]]

Stone steps lead up to a towering Cathedral, serving as the highest landmark in the city. The Cathedral's immediate surroundings feature an unworldly serenity, quite the juxtaposition with the bustling marketplace only a few blocks away.

The Mondstadt Cathedral undoubtedly puts all other Cathedrals I've visited to shame in terms of grandeur and magnificence. The ever-present prayers from the devoted sisters and followers have given the Cathedral the divinity it enjoys. Though perhaps not as traditional as other Cathedrals, the Mondstadt Cathedral bears the spirit of its people and culture. Legend has it that the Holy Lyre der Himmel, which Barbatos used to liberate Mondstadt centuries ago, is kept right here in its halls.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - First Visit to Mondstadt 3.jpg|300px]]

I've heard the stories of the legendary Anemo Archon and his beloved lyre in many taverns across the continent, as they are a second home to bards and musicians. The story goes: Mondstadt was ruled by the Aristocrats in the distant past, who periodically sacrificed slaves to [[Ursa the Drake|a drake]] as tributes for a false treaty of peace. [[Vennessa]], one of the slaves at the time, defeated the drake with the help of the Anemo Archon themselves, who had taken on the guise of a bard. Together, they liberated and revitalized the city of Mondstadt.

I have to admit, Mondstadt indeed is a free and open city; this fact is evident in its culture and people. Earlier, I asked a [[Amber|lively young maiden]] on the street for directions. As soon as she learned that I was a bard from afar, she kindly extended an offer to show me around the marketplace.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - First Visit to Mondstadt 4.jpg|300px]]

Truth to be told &mdash; with no disrespect &mdash; this young maiden, who claimed to be a member of the Knights of Favonius, was a bit too much for a simple bard such as me; her generous tour around the city only ended at midnight. I have no time to take to my notebook to pen down how the city is at night, for the calling of the bed is beyond what even the sister's prayers could keep at bay.

Good night. May the Anemo Archon, the protector of Mondstadt, be my muse, and gift me with wondrous rhymes at dawn.

===Ludi Harpastum===
For us freedom-loving bards, it is our journey, and not our destination that we most enjoy. Or at least, that is what I believed for many decades before arriving in Mondstadt.

Today marks my tenth day in Mondstadt, a complete contradiction to my initial itinerary. (I was originally to leave for my next destination two days ago.)

One reason I've decided to stay is that I found Mondstadt to be perfectly faithful to its depiction by Alan the Bard, whose poetry inspires me the most. Its sweet and mysterious secrets are hidden in unknown spots, silently yearning to be discovered. However, if I'm truly honest, my stay in Mondstadt has been extended because of Ludi Harpastum, an annual festival in the city. What a delight! How could I miss out on such an occasion?

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - Ludi Harpastum 2.png|300px]]

I once heard a drunk Mondstadt merchant say that when Mondstadt was still but a small village, it was graced by the feather of a free bird, dropped by Barbatos. It was that feather that allowed Mondstadt to become the city it is today. Ever since, a commemoration has taken place every year to thank the Anemo Archon for his blessing. Over time, this commemoration grew to be the huge festival that we all know as Ludi Harpastum. Nowadays, it is fifteen days full of exquisite wine, poetry, music, flowers, and rituals. At this time of the year, the whole city bursts with joy and freedom.

The citizens of Mondstadt were already busy preparing for the festival on the day I arrived.

Taverns and restaurants display their finest dishes at their doorstep, while Dawn Winery delivers plenty of barrels filled with craft beer and cider. (Believe me, Mondstadt has all the best brews in Teyvat.) Barbatos' guidance will lead you through the happy streets of Mondstadt, where all kinds of cheese, grilled meat, and fresh fruit release delicious fragrances. Each family hangs a handmade Harpastum on their doors, made by the lady of their household. Inspired bards from all over the continent stop in their tracks to sing their wonderful poems.

I'm sure that folks nowadays have forgotten about the original sacred aspect of Ludi Harpastum and might see it as a mere succession of lively events, no different from any ordinary festival. However, to us bards with a keen eye for detail, Ludi Harpastum is definitely the best festival in the mystical land of Teyvat. Even an outsider to Mondstadt like me can enjoy the feelings of freedom and independence that are unique to this city in just a short amount of time.

In my opinion, the people and customs of Mondstadt are freer than in any other place in Teyvat, and it shows during the exciting festivities of Ludi Harpastum which last all night long.

I attended the gliding championship during the last days of the festival, standing among the cheerful crowd on the plaza next to the Cathedral. There, I immediately recognized the girl who showed me around Mondstadt on my first day. I remembered her proudly telling me about being a gliding champion, though I had doubted her at the time. Now that I've seen her glide with my own eyes, like a red flash tearing through the sky, I have no choice but to admit that Barbatos blessed his people with freedom, courage, vitality and fierce willpower. All of these things run deep in their veins.

Of course, I needed to find a way to apologize to the great Anemo Archon for being skeptical of his disciple. After the championship, I quietly hung a poem that I wrote for the young girl in fiery red on the most obvious wind chime in the plaza, in the hope that she would find my apologies and best wishes &mdash; things I was too ashamed to tell her myself.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - Ludi Harpastum 1.png|300px]]

Even in the middle of the night, it's not unusual to hear noise and to see the market being illuminated by glowing lights when I gaze outside my window. When I one day become too old to travel, I wish to settle in a small house I'd build in a sunny place on the outskirts of Mondstadt. If people were to knock on my door to bring me craft beer from Angel's Share, I'd welcome them with my most passionate verses.
