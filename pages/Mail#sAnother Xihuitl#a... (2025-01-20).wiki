|text      = Seeing Citlalin getting all restless again made me realize that it's another "Xihuitl" come and gone. Right, "Xihuitl"... That's an old slang from my generation, basically meaning a year. As the Tzitzimitl I created by binding my own [[Stella Fortuna]], Citlalin gets particularly lively on my birthday.

They used to say reading Mirage Warriors was a contest of outlasting the author. I never met Nakajima Jun, but... well, she didn't outlast me. After that, I stopped caring much about birthdays. You better not lose to me either! We've got to celebrate again next year.

Ugh, I just had a tiny sip of some drink, and now I don't even know what I'm writing. If you're reading this, rip it up after you read it! No, wait &mdash; don't even read it, just tear it up now!
