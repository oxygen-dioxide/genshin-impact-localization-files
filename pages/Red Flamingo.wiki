|description = A noble and elegant bird, with a pair of broad wings and long, slender legs.<br>This species of bird was once mistaken for a relative of [[Qucusaur]]s due to their distinctive body shapes and coloration. It was not until a number of knowledgeable people learned how to get close to them and studied them in detail that their true nature was understood. This is the reason behind the Red Flamingo's nickname, the "Toothless [[Saurian]]s." The story of this misunderstanding was chronicled by the [[Flower-Feather Clan]], and has become a source of inspiration for many a song...
