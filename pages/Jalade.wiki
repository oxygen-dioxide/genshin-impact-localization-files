==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jalade:''' I can't keep working here. Maybe I should try relocating to [[Romaritime Harbor]]?
:{{DIcon}} Why can't you stay in Lumidouce Harbor?
::'''Jalade:''' Ah, right. You're not working here, so you probably don't know.
::'''Jalade:''' This place is far from the [[Court of Fontaine]], and we're not exactly swimming in choices for shops or recreation of any kind, really. There's only one tavern, but I'm not a big drinker.
::{{DIcon}} So, where are you going?
:::'''Jalade:''' I... I haven't decided yet.
:::'''Jalade:''' I can't really go to Romaritime Harbor. It's directly adjacent to the desert, and my friend who works there told me that the wind is always blowing in a bunch of sand.
:::'''Jalade:''' If I get blasted by that wind for too long, my skin would surely become a grotesque horror show.
:::'''Jalade:''' I suppose if all else fails, I can always look for a job back in the city...
::{{DIcon}} About Doutey...
:::'''Jalade:''' Mr. [[Doutey]] is a good guy. He's really diligent and friendly, and always puts others first.
:::'''Jalade:''' Having said that, the man is a bit too obsessed with reports, data sheets, and meeting minutes.
:::'''Jalade:''' I half-suspect the main reason he proposed to expand Lumidouce Harbor was so that he could immerse himself in a deluge of meetings every day.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Jalade:''' In any case, I wish you a pleasant stay in Lumidouce Harbor. Goodbye.
