'''Gold Leaf and Pearly Jade''' is [[Ningguang]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Half of Ningguang's hair is tied up into a wide bun resembling a bow. The rest falls into two divided parts. Her bun is accessorized with a black hairpin, and she wears a red tassel decoration atop her head which lays between her eyes.

Ningguang wears a white, high-necked sleeveless qipao dress with side slits that reach up to the thigh, unveiling black shorts with diamond-cut patterns, below her left midriff where her {{Geo}} [[Vision]] resides. Ginkgo and phoenix motifs are embellished throughout her dress, accessories, and detached ruffled sleeves. Her gloves are decorated with copper patterns and claw attachments on the thumb, ring, and pinky fingers that act as Antique Chinese fingernail guards.
