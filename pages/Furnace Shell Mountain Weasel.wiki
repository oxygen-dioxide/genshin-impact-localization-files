{{Description|An ancient variant of mountain weasel that has adapted to a unique, [[Phlogiston]]-rich environment isolated from the outside world. Some researchers from the [[Saurian Relics Association]] believe that despite the appearance that it has developed a symbiotic relationship with the [[Source Mechanism|Source Mechanisms]], said mechanisms are actually controlling it through the ample Phlogiston that permeates its body.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}{{Description|An ancient variant of mountain weasel that has adapted to a unique, [[Phlogiston]]-rich environment isolated from the outside world.<br>By consuming creatures rich in Phlogiston, this species accumulates power in the shell it holds. After a prolonged existence in the ruins of the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|Sacred Mountain]], its affinity for Phlogiston seems to have caused it to be influenced by the [[Source Mechanism]]s within the ruins, creating a unique symbiotic relationship between them.|[[Archive]]}}
