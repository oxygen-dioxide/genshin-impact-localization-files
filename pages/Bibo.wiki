==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Bibo is, on the surface, a fishmonger &mdash; however, this is merely a cover for his real occupation as a smuggler. While the [[Millelith]] are suspicious of him, and have even posted a public announcement on the [[Chihu Rock Bulletin Board#B|Chihu Rock Bulletin Board]] declaring the suspicious activity around his market, they have not found enough evidence to prove his guilt.

Bibo was the one who found [[Atsuko]] after she escaped from [[Inazuma]]. He also appears to be on good terms with [[Linling]].

===Personality===
Bibo claims to be a fisherman when he actually upholds a smuggling front, claiming that he can get anything from anywhere at the right price. Initially, he made Inazuma a lone exception as saw the nation too dangerous regardless of how much he would have been paid to get items from there, due to the [[Climate#A Nation Closed by Thunder|ferocious storms surrounding]] the nation and the tight security of the [[Kanjou Commission]]. After the [[Sakoku Decree]] was abolished and the storms dispelled, Bibo saw an opportunity to increase his business and bring in items from Inazuma.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Bibo:''' Hey there. If you're here to view the goods, I'm afraid I'm still waiting on the latest delivery...
:'''Bibo:''' But trust me, it'll be worth the wait. Everything I sell is freshly acquired, straight off the boat!
;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
::'''Bibo:''' ...But I should tell you up front, I don't deal with any goods from Inazuma.
:{{DIcon}} Are you a fishmonger?
::'''Bibo:''' Fishmonger? Are you trying to suss me out or something? No need, let me tell you how it is, plain and simple.
::'''Bibo:''' Let's put it like this: I can get you whatever you need, from wherever it is &mdash; as long as the price is right.
:;(Before completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Bibo:''' ...Except if it's from Inazuma: It's not about the money, I'm just not taking that kind of risk.
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Bibo:''' Even if it's from Inazuma, if you catch my drift.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about Inazuma.
:;(Before completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Bibo:''' For the average person, getting into Inazuma is nigh on impossible!
:::'''Bibo:''' Even if you're lucky enough to make it across the ocean alive, that border is simply impenetrable.
:::'''Bibo:''' I do not understand their [[Inazuma Shogunate|national administration]]'s mindset. Far too isolationist in my opinion...
:::'''Bibo:''' Not long ago, I actually rescued [[Atsuko|a girl who escaped from Inazuma]]... She's the only person I've ever known to get out of there without official approval.
:::'''Bibo:''' So, if you're one of these who is desperate for a new Inazuman toy to play with, telling you &mdash; let it go!
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Bibo:''' Before, it would be a monumental task to get to Inazuma. If you were lucky enough to make it across the ocean alive, that border would be impenetrable.
:::'''Bibo:''' But that's all in the past now. The trade routes have been reopened, so I can get over there and get you anything you need, whenever you need it!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Bibo:''' Alright, if you're not buying then don't stick around... We don't want to attract the Millelith's attention...
