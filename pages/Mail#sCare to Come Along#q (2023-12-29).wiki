|text      = I've heard the ambient temperature is dropping rather quickly in several different climes. I wonder if your travels have taken you to a place with such inclement weather?

Naturally, the rainforest is warm and humid as always, and remains an excellent place to escape the winter chill. So, would you consider overwintering in [[Gandharva Ville]]?

There are fresh fruits and mushrooms aplenty, and you can go hunting with the [[Forest Rangers]] (naturally, within the limits stipulated by the rainforest protection regulations). I can confidently say that every day here is filled with excitement.

Should you be interested, then come find me. I look forward to you doing your bit to contribute to the lively atmosphere here.
