{{Description|"Actually, training regulations only had the phrase "interdiction fire," but the protagonist of this novel believes that even how stylish your terminology is can affect how motivated your troops are, which can put your opponents on the back foot right from the get-go... I think that's a good point, so I changed the regulations!"}}
'''Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire''' is [[Chevreuse]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|4}}
** This particle generation has a '''10''' seconds cooldown.
* Interdiction shot or the Overcharged Ball has a viewfinder-like circle appears on the screen, surrounds the aiming cursor. Chevreuse locks on the enemy that was in the circle, and unlocks on that enemy if the enemy moved away or if Chevreuse turned away. If no enemy is locked, interdiction shot or the Overcharged Ball will be fired based on the aiming cursor, which is still able to hit enemies and yield Elemental Particles.
* Interdiction shot or the Overcharged Ball can only lock on enemies, including most hostile [[wildlife]]. Objects such as [[Elemental Monument]]s, [[Regisvines]]' shields, [[Shouki no Kami]]'s Nirvana Engines, [[Spider]]s, and [[Defense Mechanism]]s will not be locked on. However, they can be hit by it if the skill is fired manually by aiming.
** [[Wildlife]] and enemies that are in a state where they would not be [[Aggravation|aggravated]] upon approach will still be locked on.
** Hostile wildlife that does not cause the player to enter combat mode, such as [[Forest Boar]]s, cannot be locked on.
* If locked on, Interdiction shot or the Overcharged Ball will home in on its target.
** Ãdditionally, this projectile is not considered a true projectile, as the manually-aimed shot fired from outside of the lock-on range does not perform like a Bow Charged Attack when hitting [[Weak Point]].
* Interdiction shot or the Overcharged Ball has a very short range compared to the normal Bow Charged Attack.
* Chevreuse can hold the skill for a maximum of '''5''' seconds. The skill is automatically released afterwards.
* Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire's continuous HP restoration first activates 2s after casting and every 2s afterwards for a total of 6 activations.
