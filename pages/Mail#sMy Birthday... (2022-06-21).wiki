|text    = Hey, do you have any plans tonight? I've prepared many unique fireworks to set off with you when night falls!

It won't be like the [[Summer Festival]], but every single firework carries a special meaning. There's my masterpiece from last year which I'm really proud of, and a youkai-patterned firework I invented recently... Oops, no more spoilers! It won't be a surprise if I tell you all about it now. You must come and see them yourself!

I always enjoy celebrating other people's birthdays because celebration brings people laughter and joy. When I opened my candy box today, the kids suddenly showed up from nowhere and shouted "Happy birthday, Yoimiya!" cheerfully...

That really made my day! I wish everyday could be my birthday!

I gave the kids my candy as usual, but saved the last three to share with you and [[Paimon]]!
