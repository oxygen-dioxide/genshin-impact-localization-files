==Dialogue==
===Captain Zoya Snezhevna's Report (I)===
...Up until now, our cooperation with the Tanit tribe has gone quite smoothly. The elder, [[Babel]], has made it clear to [[Azariq]] that she is willing to work with us. Helping her take control of the tribe should aid our desert expedition to explore the Eternal Oasis...<br />
...<br />
...The transfer of power within the Tanit tribe is complete. The other eight elders have been done away with... a lot quicker than we anticipated. We have no clue what means Babel used. Perhaps some new assassin was called upon... Some have left, others have dissappeared...<br />
...<br />
...The Tanit tribe is well-organized thanks to Babel and Azariq. It seem that the recently concluded upheaval has not done any obvious damage to the tribe...<br />
...This may or may not be a good thing for us...<br />
...Regardless, it is our turn to uphold our end of the bargain. The Tanit tribe will obtain supplies and technical aid from [[Snezhnaya]]...

===Captain Zoya Snezhevna's Report (II) ===
...Our scouts and prospectors have been disappearing in the Tanit hunting grounds. Three people in total have been lost so far...<br />
...Babel assures me that the Tanit will cooperate in the investigation, but though I agree that there is no reason for these desert people to undermine our cooperation, we cannot fully trust them...<br />
...<br />
...[[Froderock Fronkonsteen|Professor Froderock]]’s report is quite interesting. Following an analysis of their language patterns and reading activities, he believes that the education level of these desert folk may not be low...<br />
Though their economic situation is exceedingly lacking, they nonetheless have the contacts to gain access to experimental records discarded by the Akademiya, and a process of continuous reading, self-driven studies and practical application have helped them establish a stable knowledge system...<br />
...<br />
...In many places, they have even surpassed the people of Sumeru, who are reliant on the Akasha to process information and practical skills...

===Captain Zoya Snezhevna's Report (III)===
...Babel ceased communication with us without warning...<br />
...<br />
...We lost contact with all our listening posts. We were alone, unmoored in an endless sandstorm...<br />
...<br />
...Lieutenant Ruslan reported that our logistics troops have spotted strange shapes in the storm, seemingly observing them. They seemed to have elected not to cut off our supply line despite having the ability to. I suspected that they wanted to talk terms...<br />
...<br />
...Three weeks later, Babel’s messenger came to us with new conditions. We were to either accept her terms, or leave this desert altogether...<br />
...<br />
...We have to temporarily suspend our exploration of the Eternal Oasis and shift all our strength to dealing with the Tanit first...<br />
...<br />
...Unfortunately, our rendezvous points have been scattered. It will be difficult for us to pose any threat to them...<br />
...Professor Froderock says that he needs a "live sample." I do not know what he is talking about, but he does have overall command over us, so we have decided to find some way to capture those people... or perhaps, “that” person...
