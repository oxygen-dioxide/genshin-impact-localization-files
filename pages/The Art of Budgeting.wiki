{{Description|"When trying to strike a balance between aesthetics and practicality, budgeting is an essential skill."|2=[[Dainsleif]] in [https://youtu.be/ygb4k8FIGJQ Collected Miscellany - "Kaveh: Idealistic Ambition"]}}
'''The Art of Budgeting''' is [[Kaveh]]'s [[Utility Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Kaveh refunds 25% of the materials used. On average over time, he refunds 25% of each material used.
** The 25% is first calculated on the total number of rewards and rounded down. Then the refunded materials are re-distributed among the different materials used according to their original ratios, with decimals randomly rounded without changing the total quantity of refunded materials.{{Verify}} This means that if the quantity of any material used is not a multiple of 4, then there will be fluctuations in the amount of materials refunded.
*** For example, a furnishing that requires 12 of one material and 6 of another material has two possible distributions of refunded materials: 3 of the first material and 1 of the second material, or 2 of each material.<!-- verified in-game, this is what prompted the whole investigation that resulted in this wordy explanation--which is still ongoing and also encompasses expedition bonus and weapon forging refund talents -->
