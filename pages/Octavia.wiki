'''Octavia''' is a member of the [[Hexenzirkel]], where she goes by the codename "'''O'''."<ref name="little">{{Ref/Book|The Little Witch and the Undying Fire}}</ref><ref group="Note">Based on the book's implications about its authors, as well as multiple book characters taking inspiration from members of the Hexenzirkel, it can be assumed that Octavia is both the book character and the author who wrote herself in.</ref>

==Profile==
Little is known about Octavia other than her character in ''[[The Little Witch and the Undying Fire]]''. She is a good friend of the "legendary old witch" (likely [[Andersdotter]]) who has seen many worlds and told many tales about the "sky beyond the sky." Her home was destroyed at some point in the past, but she lacked the courage to fight back and instead took up a life of eternal wandering.<ref name="little"/>

The missing chair in [https://youtu.be/RigK4OwCCM8 Story Teaser: The Mages' Tea Party] may represent Octavia, as the witches in ''The Little Witch and the Undying Fire'' typically do not prepare a chair for Octavia at their tea parties, due to her frequent traveling.

==Trivia==
*Octavia is implied to have written Vol. 6 of ''The Little Witch and the Undying Fire''.
===Etymology===
*Octavia is the feminine form of the Latin name Octavius, which is derived from ''octavus'', meaning "the eighth."
