The '''Hydroculus''' (plural '''Hydroculi''') is an Adventure Item that can be found scattered across [[Fontaine]]. Hydroculi can be offered to any [[Statue of The Seven]] in Fontaine for rewards, are limited and do not respawn, and will not appear in [[Chests]].

When a Hydroculus is within close proximity of a player, an icon will appear on their minimap along with a sound effect. Players can also use a [[Hydroculus Resonance Stone]] to mark the location of a Hydroculus on the map.

225 Hydroculi can be found in the overworld and 46 in the [[Sea of Bygone Eras]], allowing a player to fully level up the Statues of The Seven in Fontaine with one Hydroculus to spare.
