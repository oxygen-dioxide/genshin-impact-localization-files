'''As Water Seeks Equilibrium''' is [[Neuvillette]]'s [[Normal Attack]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment can hit each individual target no more than once per '''0.4'''s. Additionally, when the duration of the Charged Attack ends, it will deal one more instance of DMG to all targets within its AoE, regardless of the timer. The final hit also deals greater [[knockback]].
** It can hit one target a maximum of '''8''' times per use.
** In practice, the hit interval may slightly vary depending on various factors such as internet connection.
** Due to its live hit detection and independent tick timer per target, if the player spins extremely fast while using Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment, it is possible to hit all targets in a circular AoE and deal close to the maximum amount of hits to each one of them within one Charged Attack. This requires a high mouse sensitivity and is not possible using a controller.
* Seal of Arbitration takes '''3'''s to form. Each Sourcewater Droplet absorbed increases formation progress by '''1/3'''.
** Releasing the Normal Attack button right as the Seal of Arbitration forms will allow Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment to be released slightly faster than if the button is held all the way.
* The range of Sourcewater Droplet absorption and Charged Attack: Equitable Judgement is highlighted on the ground while using Charged Attack Empowerment: Legal Evaluation and Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment.
* Neuvillette gains an [[Interruption Resistance]] effect that reduces incoming Poise DMG by '''50%''' while using Charged Attack Empowerment: Legal Evaluation and Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment.
* While using Charged Attack Empowerment: Legal Evaluation and Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment, Neuvillette levitates and can move over the surface of [[water]] and [[Liquid Phlogiston]].
* Charged Attack Empowerment: Legal Evaluation and Charged Attack: Equitable Judgement disable character switching, but can be interrupted by [[sprinting]], jumping, or using Neuvillette's [[Elemental Skill]] or [[Elemental Burst]].
