==Tutorial==
{{Tutorial
|image1   = Tutorial Springtime Charms Immortal Combat 1.png
|text1    = In Immortal Combat, new blocks will constantly appear in the marked zone at the top of the arena and drop down. You can control the blocks by {{Color|help|moving them left and right}}, {{Color|help|rotating them}}, or {{Color|help|speeding up their descent}}. When {{Color|help|4}} or more blocks of the same color are connected, they will be {{Color|help|cleared}}.
|image2   = Tutorial Springtime Charms Immortal Combat 2.png
|text2    = After clearing blocks, your rattan figure will attack the opposing rattan figure and gain energy based on your Chain Level.<br>Attacks will deal DMG to the opposing rattan figure and {{Color|help|deploy obstacles}} onto your opponent's field.<br>When the rattan figure on one side loses all its HP, the other side achieves victory.
|image3   = Tutorial Springtime Charms Immortal Combat 3.png
|text3    = After blocks are cleared, the blocks above the blocks that were cleared will drop down. If the blocks that drop trigger another block clear, a {{Color|help|Chain Clear}} will be triggered.<br>Chain Clears will increase the rattan figure's ATK and energy gained, and will also strengthen the effect of any {{Color|help|deployed obstacles}}.
|image4   = Tutorial Springtime Charms Immortal Combat 4.png
|text4    = Different rattan figures have skills that can be {{Color|help|tapped and unleashed}} to produce different effects that can grant buffs to your side.<br>When a rattan figure has finished charging, it will automatically use a powerful skill to obstruct your opponent.
|image5   = Tutorial Springtime Charms Immortal Combat 5.png
|text5    = Blocks can be invested with different effects during the match due to skill effects. Check each rattan figure's skill details to learn more about these effects.<br>In "Friendly Contests" and "Full-Force Faceoffs," different opponents will periodically deploy blocks with various negative effects on your side of the field.
}}

==Challenges==
The First Clear on Friendly Contest and Full-Force Faceoff of each stage rewards 100 Score.
