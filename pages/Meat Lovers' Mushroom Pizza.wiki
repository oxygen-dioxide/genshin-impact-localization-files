|description     = A pizza freshly baked
|desc_suspicious = in an oven. The messy lumps of cheese and ingredients give off a greasy smell, with a rock-hard crust just to make things worse. Well, what has the poor dish gone through to end up in this state? Was it the baking time or the excessive fermentation?
|desc_basic      = from the oven. The crust is dotted with large chunks of meat and fresh mushroom slices. The sweet, stretchy cheese further adds to the charm. You have no doubt that every slice will be snatched away the moment it is served. Speed, therefore, is a gourmet's best buddy when this pizza is on the table.
|desc_delicious  = in an oven. Every inch of the crust is saturated with the fatty aroma of meat. Some mushrooms have been sprinkled on top to add freshness. Just a small mouthful shall greet your taste buds with the rich scent of cheese — most enticing indeed. You can't help reaching for another slice before you've even finished off the one in your hand.
