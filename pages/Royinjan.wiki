''Available before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Royinjan:''' Hello, would you like to commission antique appraisal?
:{{DIcon}} Hello. You are...?
::'''Royinjan:''' I run an antique store, and I am the most reliable antique appraisal expert in Port Ormos.
::'''Royinjan:''' My grandfather was a well-renowned historian. The gift of antique appreciation runs in our family.
::'''Royinjan:''' You can definitely trust my eyes.
::'''Royinjan:''' Be it the relics of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], or the accessories of the [[Goddess of Flowers]], or even what [[King Deshret]] left amidst the desert, there is not a single thing that I cannot tell the authenticity of at first glance.
::{{DIcon}} About Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
::'''Royinjan:''' Ah... Though Greater Lord Rukkhadevata has long departed, she will always be the greatest deity of Sumeru.
::'''Royinjan:''' She defended Sumeru from calamities and troubles and left us inexhaustible knowledge and treasures after her death.
::'''Royinjan:''' So, usually, when I see an antique related to Greater Lord, I do my best to buy it and add it to my collection.
:{{DIcon}} Not right now.
::'''Royinjan:''' Sure, sure. Let me help next time.

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Royinjan:''' Hello, would you like to commission antique appraisal?
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Royinjan:''' I run an antique store &mdash; they call me the most reliable antique appraisal expert in Port Ormos.
::'''Royinjan:''' My grandfather was a well-renowned historian, so the gift of antique appreciation runs in our family.
::'''Royinjan:''' As such, you can definitely trust my eyes.
::'''Royinjan:''' Be it accessories of the Goddess of Flowers, or relics of the [[Dendro Archon]], or perhaps even that which King Deshret might have left amidst the desert sands, there is not one that can escape my appraising eye.
::{{DIcon}} About the Dendro Archon...
::'''Royinjan:''' *sigh* The Dendro Archon will always be our greatest god. The Akademiya's conduct up till now has been simply disgraceful.
::'''Royinjan:''' She defended us from such calamities and left us an inexhaustible store of wisdom and treasure...
::'''Royinjan:''' So, usually, when I see an antique related to her, I will do my best to buy it and add it to my collection.
