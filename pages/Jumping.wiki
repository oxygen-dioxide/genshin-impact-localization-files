'''Jumping''' is a movement ability that does not cost [[Stamina]]. It can be performed while standing still or while moving.

Some effects from talents or special objects like [[Spoutrock]]s allow for a higher jump.

==Diving Animation==
Jumping near a cliff high enough above water can trigger a diving animation from the character that depend on its model. Outside of [[Fontaine]], it can bring the player deeper into the water, similar to performing a [[Plunging Attack]] into water. In Fontaine, it can initiate [[Diving]] if the water is deep enough.
