|description = Detection units produced by the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] using new models of artificed components. Its original purpose was monitoring all kinds of environmental data.<br>These units were originally cooperatively managed by the Advanced Artificed Technology Research and Development Department and the Natural Ecological Environment Monitoring Department, where the former was in charge of manufacturing and deployment of the detection units while the latter was responsible for collecting and sorting data. Now that the latter department has been dismissed due to a previous experimental accident, only the former department's duties are now being performed by the Fontaine Research Institute.
