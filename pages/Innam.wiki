==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Innam:''' It's so boring to be a guard... And I can't change shifts now...
:'''Innam:''' Hello, would you like to talk?
:{{DIcon}} Sure, what about?
::'''Innam:''' Do you think luck is something you're born with?
::'''Innam:''' [[Dehya]] joined [[the Eremites]] after me, but got better assignments.
::'''Innam:''' She's working as a bodyguard for a rich girl. Great environment with high pay.
::'''Innam:''' Me, I just make the rounds here every day and have to deal with disputes between Eremite groups.
::'''Innam:''' Life in the Eremites isn't as exciting as people might think.
:{{DIcon}} You can't change shifts?
::'''Innam:''' Yeah, at first, we mercenaries who worked at the docks could change shifts as we liked. Bad mood? Well, we could just change shifts and go for a drink.
::'''Innam:''' But now the Inspector won't allow it...
::{{DIcon}} Why is that?
::'''Innam:''' A few days ago, a young man who'd not been here long asked [[Matari]] to change shifts, and happened upon a sea monster warning.
::'''Innam:''' After the warning was withdrawn, the Inspector came to look into the situation at the harbor and questioned the young man. The poor lad could not answer.
::'''Innam:''' The Inspector checked the roster again, and found out there was a shift change. Now she's been paying extra attention to this matter and no one dares to break her rules.
::'''Innam:''' *sigh* I just want to finish work early and go to the bar for drinks.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Innam:''' *sigh* Guess I'll keep working this boring job...
