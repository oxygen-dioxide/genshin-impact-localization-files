|text1    = A Qucusaurus whose extraordinary form is a result of being unable to withstand the great power it has been granted. It will fly into the air during combat and enter the "Golden Flame" energy-gathering form, creating a Ward around itself and launching a Flamewind Feather towards the ground that summons a flamewind. If you cannot destroy the Flamewind Feather before the Qucusaurus dives down into it, the creature will use a Phlogiston Current to return to the skies. This will persist until it is exhausted and returns to its original form. It seems, then, that {{Color|help|destroying the Flamewind Feather using Elements that react with Pyro}} may be the key to victory...
