{{Description|According to the legend, the strike that brought and end to the [[Orobashi|serpent god]] was slashed right here. In this deep canyon that runs through Yashiori Island, the remnant reverberations of lightning bolts continue to this day, as if the thunder elves are still chattering about the legendary scene that tore through the sky and the earth thousands of years ago.|[[Archive]]}}
{{Description| A certain power once split Yashiori Island clean in twain.<br />The giant serpent's will and dreams were ended, but its lingering malice broods still in the gloom of this gorge...|[[Expedition]] description}}

{{Lang|'''Musoujin Gorge'''|ja=無想刃狭間|ja_rm=Musoujin Hazama}} is located in the eastern part of [[Yashiori Island]], [[Inazuma]]. It was formed during a battle between the [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]] and [[Orobashi]]. The Raiden Shogun performed [[Musou no Hitotachi]], her divine judgement, and cleaved both the serpent and the island. The [[Tatarigami]] have emerged from the serpent's remains.<ref name="travel highlights">Official Genshin Impact Website, Inazuma Travel Highlights: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Musoujin Gorge]</ref>

The Musoujin Gorge is affected by [[Balethunder]] which will result in continuous HP loss unless Thunderwood is nearby or the player is carrying an [[Electrogranum]]. There are [[Thunder Sakura Bough]]s throughout the gorge that the player can interact with to summon Electrogranum and stay protected from the Balethunder. There is also a river of [[Electro Water]] which will drain the active character's HP even faster than Balethunder.
