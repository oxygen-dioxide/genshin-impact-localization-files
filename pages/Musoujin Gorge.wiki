{{Lang|'''Musoujin Gorge'''|ja=無想刃狭間|ja_rm=Musoujin Hazama}} is located in the eastern part of [[Yashiori Island]], [[Inazuma]]. It was formed during a battle between the [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]] and [[Orobashi]]. The Raiden Shogun performed [[Musou no Hitotachi]], her divine judgement, and cleaved both the serpent and the island. The [[Tatarigami]] have emerged from the serpent's remains.<ref name="travel highlights">Official Genshin Impact Website, Inazuma Travel Highlights: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Musoujin Gorge]</ref>

The Musoujin Gorge is affected by [[Balethunder]] which will result in continuous HP loss unless Thunderwood is nearby or the player is carrying an [[Electrogranum]]. There are [[Thunder Sakura Bough]]s throughout the gorge that the player can interact with to summon Electrogranum and stay protected from the Balethunder. There is also a river of [[Electro Water]] which will drain the active character's HP even faster than Balethunder.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|According to the legend, the strike that brought and end to the [[Orobashi|serpent god]] was slashed right here. In this deep canyon that runs through Yashiori Island, the remnant reverberations of lightning bolts continue to this day, as if the thunder elves are still chattering about the legendary scene that tore through the sky and the earth thousands of years ago.|Viewpoint, [[Rift Valley, Yashiori Island]]}}
{{Description|A certain power once split Yashiori Island clean in twain.<br />The giant serpent's will and dreams were ended, but its lingering malice broods still in the gloom of this gorge...|[[Expedition]] description}}
{{Description|This narrow and majestic rift valley runs through the eastern part of Yashiori Island.<br />This extraordinary sight is no natural formation, but rather is the result of the fight in which the Electro Archon slayed the giant serpent. The rift valley is named after the Musou no Hitotachi, a testament to the Electro Archon's skilled swordsmanship.<br />To this day, the remains of the giant serpent are still scattered throughout Yashiori Island. The Tatarigami that emerged from this god's remains seem to be awakening...|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}
