|introduction = After helping a ship get into the harbor, a navigator will generally be idle while waiting for the next task. As such, the sailors at port might invite the harbor staff for a meal and a drink, or perhaps to play some card games that all, young and old, are familiar with. These traditions have led to quite a few navigators becoming skilled players indeed...<br>{{color|bp|Special Rule: You will not use your own deck, but a preset deck named "Torrent of Proliferating Organisms" instead.}}
