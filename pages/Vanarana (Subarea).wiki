{{Location Intro|description=<p>There are two different versions of Vanarana: the one that exists in reality, and the dream version where the [[Aranara]] live (which is called '''Mahavanaranapna''').</p> }}

==Dream State==
[[File:Vanarana Dream Switch.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=An image of the Silapna where the player can switch between Vanarana and Dream Vanarana]]
The player can switch between the two by playing the Rhythm of the Great Dream with the [[Vintage Lyre]] at a [[Silapna]]; the ability to do this is unlocked by the quest [[The World of Aranara]], part of the [[Aranyaka]] World Quest series. The area's [[Statue of The Seven]] is located in the dream version.

:'''Messily-Written Note:''' "...Arama feels happy for the knowledge Paimon taught me. The spell turned out to be Treasure rather than Tracer. Nara {{Traveler}} defeated Vanagni effortlessly. So amazing..."

==Trivia==
* Before sufficient progression in the quest ''[[The World of Aranara]]'':
** The [[Statue of The Seven]] is not shown on the map.
** The area surrounding the Statue of The Seven and the area north of it, including the cave with the [[Tree of Dreams]], is covered by terrain and cannot be accessed. When traveling north on the path that should pass the Statue of The Seven, the path abruptly ends at a cliff-face. (This cliff-face appears uncolored like normal terrain under [[Elemental Sight]].)
** Players can step into this area freely.
** Vanarana is in its dream state and therefore has the dream lighting as well as harvestable [[Viparyas]] and no [[Padisarah]]s.
* When approaching the center lake of this area, the background music will dynamically transition into a version with a singing voice.
* Even the Aranara feel that "Mahavanaranapna" is too long for a name.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Sumeru|Sumeru}}</ref> 

===Etymology===
* Vanarana may be derived from a combination of two Sanskrit words, {{Lang|''vána''|sa=वन}} which means "forest,"<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/vana Vana, Vaṇa, Vāna: 32 definitions]</ref> and {{Lang|''{{w|Rana (title)|rāṇā}}''|sa=राणा}} which could refer to a title akin to "chief" or "king" in Indian history.<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/rana#history Rana, Raṇa: 26 definitions]</ref> It may also be derived from {{Lang|''áraṇa''|sa=अरण्य}}, meaning "forest", "wilderness" or "foreign land"; which can refer to a "quiet" or "secluded place" in Chinese Buddhism {{Lang|zh=阿兰那|zh_rm=ālánnà}}.<ref>Tibetan Buddhist Encyclopedia: [http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Aranya Aranya]</ref>
** According to [[Arama]], the full name Mahavanaranapna translates to "Vanarana of Great Dreams";<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The World of Aranara}}</ref> where the affixed parts of the name likely derive from {{Lang|''mahā''|sa=महा}} meaning "great", and {{Lang|''svápna''|sa=स्वप्न}} meaning "dream."
