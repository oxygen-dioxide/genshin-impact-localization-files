|description     = A dessert with a romantic flair. 
|desc_suspicious = The meringue has been baked to form a passable shape &mdash; albeit after several failed attempts that resulted in suspicious, burnt lumps. Unfortunately though, the cooking took so long that the [[Bulle Fruit]] now grimaces with frustration and no longer tastes sweet.
|desc_basic      = Add jam and fillings made from Bulle Fruit into tart shells and spread some meringue over the top before baking in the oven. The dish offers three fruity aromas all in one bite, making it a top choice for post-meal snacks.
|desc_delicious  = The crispy and flaky tart shell and refreshing fruit fillings melt in your mouth. The harmonious coalescence of brown and white colors on the meringue reminds one of a stretch of gilded cloud in the warm sunlight. A pleasant surprise to your tastebuds indeed.
