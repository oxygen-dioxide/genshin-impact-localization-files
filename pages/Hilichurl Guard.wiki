'''Hilichurl Guards''' are [[Hilichurls]] that are armed with a club and shield.

In combat, Hilichurl Guards deal {{Color|Physical DMG}} using their clubs. Their shields protect them from frontal attacks, although attacks with sufficient force can still bypass them by staggering the hilichurl. The shield can be destroyed, with some attacks being more effective than others. In the event that the shield is destroyed, they function identically as [[Hilichurl Fighter]]s.
