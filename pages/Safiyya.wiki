{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Safiyya:''' Hello, please do not touch the plants in the garden. Especially the plants in the laboratory.
:{{DIcon}} Because they are rare?
::'''Safiyya:''' I guess it's part of the reason? I'm just a merc guarding this place, so I don't really know much about these plants.
::'''Safiyya:''' But tragic incidents where researchers lost months or even years of progress have occurred quite a few times here in the past, and they were all because some plants were accidentally damaged.
::'''Safiyya:''' It sounds really sad, right? I would go mad if all the money I made over the years was lost overnight.
::'''Safiyya:''' So, when I think of it like that, I pay extra attention to the safety of these plants.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
::'''Safiyya:''' Thank you for your cooperation.
