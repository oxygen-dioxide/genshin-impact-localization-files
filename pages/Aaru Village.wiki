==Descriptions==
{{Description|The well-versed poets of [[Tulaytullah]], "the city of sapphire," Thamudian gladiators with golden eyes in [[Saleh]], [[Jinn]] in [[Ay-Khanoum]]... Countless kingdoms that rose and fell after the great kingdom of [[King Deshret]] collapsed, together with their heroes and legends, were all immortalized in ancient nursery rhymes in this village, echoing around the children's beds...<br />After all those years, the remnants of King Deshret have long muddled the boundaries between histories and myths, blending them all seamlessly into their memories...|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/Refugee Shelters|Refugee Shelters]]}}

==Lore==
The location where Aaru Village is currently situated was where Akhtamun, a city built by King Deshret during his reign, once stood. After King Deshret's death, Akhtamun's surviving residents became the earliest inhabitants of what would later become known as Aaru Village.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Candace}}</ref>

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*Aaru may be derived from a location in ancient Egyptian mythology known as {{lang|''{{w|Aaru}}''|egy={{wt|jꜣrw}}|egy_tl=Reeds}}, the heavenly paradise where Osiris rules.
