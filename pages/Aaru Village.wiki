==Lore==
Aaru Village is built around a fortress from the time of [[Gurabad]], which had been constructed during the reign of a "paranoid prince" and was used to guard the border between the desert and rainforest civilizations.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Border Fort|note=All of the chess pieces at Safhe Shatranj, and their locations on the chessboard, represent actual structures from Deshret's civilization. The Border Fort is identical to the [[Village Chief's House]] at Aaru Village, and its position is south-southwest of the [[Khaj-Nisut (Quest Item)|Khaj-Nisut]] piece, roughly in the same location as Aaru Village.}}</ref><ref name="BotRS">{{Ref/Weapon|Beacon of the Reed Sea}}</ref> According to [[Candace]], the village's earliest inhabitants were survivors of King Deshret's civilization from the city of [[Akhtamun]], which he had established somewhere within the desert.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Candace}}</ref> After Deshret's death, his civilization collapsed into numerous warring city-states, beginning an era of chaos where power constantly changed hands and cities rose and fell. Over time, refugees of the desert grew sick of the bloodshed. Sometime following [[Faramarz]]'s revenge on [[Tulaytullah|his former kingdom]] and escape to the rainforest, the refugees — led by a [[Old Blind Poet|well-educated but blind heir]] from Tulaytullah — swore off the rule of kings. They left the desert to build a new home for themselves, which they named Aaru after the "ancient dream of the gods," where they would preserve the embers of their civilization and await the return of Al-Ahmar.<ref name="BotRS" /><ref>Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Mausoleum of King Deshret, Center|Mausoleum of King Deshret, Center]]</ref>

The village's water source is a {{w|stepwell}}<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Desert Bloom}}</ref> below the village proper, supplied by ancient infrastructure that appears to have been created during the era of the desert kingdoms. While convenient for a desert community, the most one could reasonably draw was a bucket full at a time. This changed when a former [[Kshahrewar]] Village Keeper remained coherent enough to help build the White Lift, an elevator that lowers down to the surface of the well.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kazim}}</ref>

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*Aaru may be derived from a location in ancient Egyptian mythology known as {{Lang|''{{w|Aaru}}''|egy={{wt|jꜣrw}}|egy_tl=Reeds}}, the heavenly paradise where Osiris rules.
