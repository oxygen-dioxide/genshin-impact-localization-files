{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing the quest [[Test of Courage (Event Quest)|Test of Courage]])
:'''Paimon:''' Akitsu Yuugei... Both Ei and Heizou mentioned that game before. Shall we check it out?

;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be where people play Akitsu Yuugei. This place seems to be opening back up, just like Ei said.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't really see anyone here though... Heizou said that we can start the game by talking to the Bulletin Board, so Paimon thinks we should try that.
:'''Paimon:''' We should still be careful though. Paimon really doesn't want to be trapped here!
