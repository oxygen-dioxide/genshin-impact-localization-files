==Profile==
Ematol is a member of the [[Knights of Favonius]]. Originally, she was a Weapons Officer of the [[Knights_of_Favonius#Investigation|Investigation Team]] led by [[Albedo]]. After the [[Knights_of_Favonius#The_7th_Company,_Combined_Arms|7th Company]] was reformed, Ematol was transferred there as its Weapons Officer by the [[Jean|Acting Grand Master]] at [[Phonia]]'s behest.

Ematol is currently living as a roommate with Phonia under an arrangement where she is Phonia's tenant.

===Appearance===
Ematol wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeved shirt, tight-fitting pants under a gray skirt and a white plate armor worn on top. Unlike other knights, she does not have her knees covered and only has greaves on her legs. The Knights of Favonius crest decorates her breastplate.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ematol:''' Let the sparks fly, and the explosions roll! Honorary Knight and the Helper in White, how are you enjoying "Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades"? I'd be happy to answer your questions, whenever you feel like asking them!
:{{DIcon}} Care to tell us more about the story behind the latest episode of Dodoco's adventure?
::'''Ematol:''' Absolutely, I'd be delighted to! When Lisa made me responsible for the sequel, she came up with a load of ideas about the plot...
::'''Ematol:''' "The big, bad Spikey Fish King, repelled by the valiant Dodoco, slunk back to his lair, tail between his metaphorical legs..."
::'''Ematol:''' "The Spikey Fish Vanguard said to him: Your Highness! Why don't we gather all the Spikey Fish Elders, Spikey Fish Guards, and Spikey Fish Sweepers, and launch an unstoppable counterattack?"
::'''Ematol:''' As for how the story pans out... it's probably best if you experience it yourself, Honorary Knight! After all, I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise!
::{{DIcon}} The tension's building! Go go, Dodoco!
::'''Paimon:''' We're rooting for you, Dodoco!
:{{DIcon}} I'm gonna take a break now, but I'll be back!
::'''Ematol:''' No problem! I'm not going anywhere, so whenever you're ready, Honorary Knight!

:'''Ematol:''' Hmm. Perhaps for stability, tail fins might... Oh, hello there, Honorary Knight! 7th Company's Weapons Officer, Ematol, reporting for duty! What orders do you bring?
::{{DIcon}} Well, what are you doing?
:::'''Ematol:''' Reporting in! As per normal, I am working on new bomb structures! And... as per Phonia's request, I am "wargaming in silence, so as to spare her ears the damage"!
:::{{DIcon}} Err, bomb structures, you say...?
::::'''Ematol:''' That's right! I mean, you must have seen the [[Klee|Spark Knight]]'s lovely, gorgeous Jumpy Dumpties too, yes?
::::'''Ematol:''' Though I, Ematol, am just a lowly, bog-standard alchemist of no significance, I still have a dream!
::::'''Ematol:''' Not to delve into the structures of gold-mercury amalgams, but to achieve even a twentieth of the might bestowed upon Jumpy Dumpties by their construction!
::::'''Ematol:''' And that's why I've been working on an all-new design! Explosive speed &mdash; perfected! Shockwaves &mdash; shattering! Craftsmanship &mdash; simple. Cost... reasonable... Ah, I get the shivers just thinking about it...
::::'''Ematol:''' ...Ah, uh, sorry. Got carried away again, didn't I? Anyway, if there are any bombs... I mean, any things I can do for you, please let me know, Honorary Knight!
:::{{DIcon}} Alright. I shan't disturb you, then...
::::'''Ematol:''' Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!
::{{DIcon}} Weapons Officer?
:::'''Ematol:''' That's right, that's me! We work in logistics, in the rear-line, so it's normal that you haven't heard of us. What we do is develop and test experimental equipment.
:::'''Ematol:''' For example, I'm currently designing a new long-range projectile... Anyway, if there's anything I can do for you, Honorary Knight, feel free to let me know!
::{{DIcon}} Are you taking part in the Wargame as well?
:::'''Ematol:''' Well, uh... To be more precise, Phonia... I mean, Commander Phonia, pulled me into this business...
:::'''Ematol:''' I mean, I'm not the brightest spark, so this "complicated tactics" stuff flies right over my head. I'd love nothing better than to study explosives, and follow in the Spark Knight's footsteps, setting them off, free as the wind...
:::'''Ematol:''' Ah, but if you need help repositioning the Wargame board, do let me know! Ematol, 7th Company Weapons Officer, shall be glad to render her services!
::{{DIcon}} It's fine, continue as you were.
:::'''Ematol:''' Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!

::{{DIcon}} And how's your work going?
:::'''Ematol:''' My work... Oh, you mean the development of long-range explosives? Well, it's going well! Thanks for your concern, Honorary Knight!
:::'''Ematol:''' As for the details... Uh, would you like the brief version or the slightly more thorough one?
:::{{DIcon}} Let's have the simple spiel.
::::'''Ematol:''' Sure! Put simply, I've made a launcher that can pierce heavy body armor at long range. However, the launch tube has to be scrapped after a single use, and aiming is a hassle and a half...
::::'''Ematol:''' So, the next problem we need to solve is cost-effectiveness and accuracy. I'm not sure what to do right now, but I'll keep working on it &mdash; in the name of the Spark Knight!
:::{{DIcon}} Let's hear the specifics.
::::'''Ematol:''' Of course, of course! Hehe, I didn't expect you to be interested in weapons development, Honorary Knight!
::::'''Ematol:''' First, I'm not really learned concerning archery or related mechanical devices, but when using explosives to propel projectiles, one of the easiest ways to improve range is to increase the amount of charge used.
::::'''Ematol:''' There's a famous saying: "If one pack of charge won't do, try two". Have you heard of it?
::::'''Ematol:''' Unfortunately, increasing the charge means increasing the caliber of your ammunition, which will worsen the velocity retention of said ammo. And if your ammo doesn't hit its target, you might as well have used no charge at all...
::::{{DIcon}} I see...
:::::'''Ematol:''' So I thought, perhaps we could create a nested structure within the projectile, the outer casing of which would fall away in flight so that the payload hit its target faster and more accurately, relying solely on kinetic energy to pierce armor...
::::{{DIcon}} So the greater the charge, the less the power, meaning the less the charge...
:::::'''Ematol:''' Yeah, that's about right as well!
:::::{{DIcon}} So you mean, the greater the charge, the less the charge...
:::::'''Ematol:''' Uh... What? Is that... right? Well, in some sense, I guess...
:::::'''Ematol:''' Whatever the case, I thought that we could create a nested structure within the projectile, the outer casing of which would fall away in flight so that the payload hit its target faster and more accurately. We would then rely on kinetic energy to pierce armor...
::::'''Ematol:''' See, all we need to do is to replace the low-density propellant that originally propelled the payload with a more powerful one with several times the density, and we can push the projectile out at incredible speed...
::::{{DIcon}} Ah, so that's it.
::::{{DIcon}} I don't quite get it, but it sure sounds impressive...
::::'''Ematol:''' However, the defects of such a device are also evident. The barrel and launch tube must also withstand immense pressure, and must thus be very heavy, to the point that an ordinary knight would not be able to move it...
::::'''Ematol:''' A weapon system that should have been carried by a single knight would then have to be dismantled into several parts for transport, and even its loading platform would have to be very sturdy just to withstand the recoil...
::::'''Ematol:''' Ah, I'm so sorry, great Spark Knight... When it comes down to it, my proposal is, in truth, an insult to the apex art form that is explosive weaponry...
::::{{DIcon}} What in the world are you saying...
::::{{DIcon}} Explosive weaponry? Apex art form!?
::::'''Ematol:''' A-anyway! I'll stop fantasizing now. I... I need to continue our breakthroughs on the path of explosive-assisted armor-piercing munitions!
::{{DIcon}} Are you taking part in the Wargame as well?
:::'''Ematol:''' Well, uh... To be more precise, Phonia dragged me into this business...
:::'''Ematol:''' She even said something like, "You're taking part even if you don't know the first thing about chess. This is an order I'm giving you as an intelligence officer"... Seriously! She doesn't force anyone else to do things in that way, just me!
:::'''Ematol:''' It's abuse of authority, I say! Abuse from an abusive meanie! Almost as bad as... as a Specter, or a detonator with a signal malfunction!
:::'''Ematol:''' Uh, no, wait, probably not that bad... But still, very, very bad!
:::'''Ematol:''' *sigh* It's fine, I'll let it slide. She did help me a whole bunch back when we were working on Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades, after all...
:::'''Ematol:''' And this is the first time I've ever seen her working all through the night, painting those game pieces all by her own volition. Still, while we're on the topic of comparing tabletop games, wouldn't you agree that the ones I made are more enjoyable...?
:::'''Ematol:''' Whatever the case, just let me know if you need help repositioning the Wargame board! Ematol, 7th Company Weapons Officer, shall be glad to render her services!
::{{DIcon}} It's fine, continue as you were.
:::'''Ematol:''' Yup, don't you worry about me! Just let me know if there's anything you need help with, Honorary Knight!

::{{DIcon}} Did you gain anything useful from the simulations?
:::'''Ematol:''' Reporting in, Honorary Knight! I've calibrated the explosion radii of several types of bombs, and tested their effects in simulated environments! I... guess that counts, right?
:::'''Ematol:''' And like I said earlier, it would be ideal if we could also increase our real explosion parameters by ten times!
:::'''Ematol:''' I mean, I've not got the brains for complex tactics, so I'll just focus on my explosives research, you know?
::{{DIcon}} It's fine, continue as you were.
