==Description==
"Perhaps even the sun is but a dim star before the deep, long night,"<br><!--
-->"But though fate be cruel and deceitful, it has never taken hope from us."<br><!--
-->"Courage and memory have forged your throne, death and sacrifice piled as firewood for your rekindling,"<br><!--
-->"Oh unconquered sun, you who have shone upon generations unnumbered, bear witness now to [[Natlan]]'s ideals and its future!"<br><br><!--
-->Like the first ray of light cast by the awakening day, like dawn piercing through the hedge of night.<br><!--
-->When the [[Xiuhcoatl|great dragon]] who defied the [[Heavenly Principles|heavens]] bowed its head, the long campaign finally reached an end.<br><!--
-->Stepping across the long and bloodied stair, the [[Xbalanque|leader of the mortals]] reached for the primal flame, unquenched within the [[Ochkanatlan|ineffable city]],<br><!--
-->Though the people who had crushed the shackles laid upon them by another race had yet to learn the fate that awaited them.<br><br><!--
-->Before the [[Kukulkan|fire-stealing sage]] could speak, the [[Ronova|god who pronounced death]] came forth without warning and showed the human [[Archon]] the arc of fate.<br><!--
-->It was a terrifying vision beyond human ken, a future with even less hope than draconic tyranny.<br><!--
-->All life would be devoured by boundless darkness, turned into inorganic dust within the eternal [[abyss]].<br><!--
-->The human Archon, whose domain was war, knew then that Natlan was not yet victorious, for a new war had now begun.<br><br><!--
-->The dragon sage's foresight had told of Natlan's future rulers, one like a manticore, one like a wild fox.<br><!--
-->But he did not expect to come to revere the wisdom and cunning of Xbalanque, the [[Pyro Archon]].<br><!--
-->The human Archon bartered with "death" for power, and the wisest of dragons too submitted to his plans.<br><!--
-->But he had never intended to submit to the rules, nor did he ever consider fulfilling his oath to the one who had stolen the flame.<br><br><!--
-->By the name "Haborym," life had become the sacred flame unquenchable, and the rules would be crafted into a divine throne ever-blazing.<br><!--
-->People would choose to fight back with courage and perseverance, even in the face of horrors and despair beyond comprehension.<br><!--
-->Of course, short-lived lives would surely burn out, but the sunlight would disperse the darkness again and again.<br><!--
-->For the first sun that shone over the land of blazing fire saw something in the primal flame, in the ashes, in the eyes of countless people...<br><br><!--
-->He saw the [[Och-Kan|tainted one]], defiled and devoured by the black abyss, yet nonetheless fighting to the last for humanity's sake.<br><!--
-->He saw the [[Manqu (Historical)|artisan]] whose eyes were dyed with golden tears, who, alongside the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|crimson-eyed youth]], ensured that the [[Sacred Flame]] would endure.<br><!--
-->He saw the lost tribe wandering the land, their [[Vennessa|warriors]] still fighting for freedom,<br><!--
-->He saw the warm blood, offered unto the burning sparks of stars that lit up the long night, until a thousand suns had risen...<br><br><!--
-->"[[Lord of the Night]], I entreat you, chronicle this, the first sun &mdash; the first [[Ancient Name]], 'Kiongozi.'"<br><!--
-->"I shall leave hope for the future. So long as the flame does not die, there shall still be 'hope.'"
