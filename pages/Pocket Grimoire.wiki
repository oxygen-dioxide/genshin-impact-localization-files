A manual on magic that is popular amongst students, it is portable enough to fit into one's pocket.<br />
It has been stripped of the lengthy descriptions of principles and voluminous exercises. All that is left now is exam content.<br />
Currently obsolete due to the revisions made in the 12th edition of the Magic Guide.
