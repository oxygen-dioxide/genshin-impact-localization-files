'''Aramaha''' is a historical figure of the Aranara. They, along with [[Araji]] and [[Arayama]], sealed each of the three [[Ashvattha's Concourses]] with their own rhythms, and then turned themselves into [[Vasara Tree]]s. Aramaha's Vasara Tree is located at [[Ashavan Realm]].

==Story==
Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama's friendship was comparable to the friendship of the three God-Kings: [[King Deshret]], the [[Goddess of Flowers]], and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Sapwood Blade}}</ref>

Aramaha had a great love of flowers. They knew how to take care of plant and make them healthy and strong.<ref name="Sprout">{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Nurtures the Sprout}}</ref> Their rhythm is '''"Rhythm of the Sprout,"''' which is able to generate healthier [[Dendrogranum]], which can then be used to revive [[Valaya]].<ref>Tutorial: [[Tutorial/Rhythm of the Sprout|Rhythm of the Sprout]]</ref>

Presumably during the [[cataclysm]], Aramaha fought again the [[Marana]]. Afterward, they turned into a [[Vasara Tree]] inside a sealed Ashvattha's Concourse, and left their song behind as a method to unseal it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Encounter in the Woods|note=children quests}}</ref>
