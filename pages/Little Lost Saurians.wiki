===Urubamba's Dialogue===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Urubamba)
;(If this is the player's first time talking to Urubamba)
:'''Urubamba:''' Yoohoo&mdash; Come back now, little ones! Yooohoooo&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:'''Urubamba:''' Yoooohoooo&mdash; *sigh*
:'''Urubamba:''' I feel awful. So... sad. How can I... make it better...
:'''Urubamba:''' Ugh, I step out for one moment to buy some hay, and now I have no idea where my other eight little Tatankasaurs have run off to...
:'''Urubamba:''' They're still so small! What if they get bullied by [[hilichurl]]s... or lost... or trapped somewhere?
:'''Urubamba:''' Kind soul, is there any chance you've seen my little Tatankasaurs?
:{{DIcon}} What do they look like?
:'''Urubamba:''' I raised their mother, you know. She's practically my daughter.
:'''Urubamba:''' She's one of the most stunning saurians in the whole of the Collective of Plenty. She even won the grand prize in our regional beauty pageant!
:'''Urubamba:''' Those eight little rascals all inherited their mother's good looks. They've got fair, pink skin, with a dash of purple on their perfectly symmetrical fan-shaped horns.
:'''Urubamba:''' If you see them, please help me get them back here. I'm counting on you!
:'''Urubamba:''' My little saurians... I promise I won't be so strict with you anymore...
;(Proceed to next section)

;(If the player has talked to Urubamba before)
:'''Urubamba:''' Come back to me, my little saurians! I'll let you eat all the [[Saurus Crackers|Saurian Crackers]] you want, and I promise I won't keep making you do strength training every single day.
:'''Urubamba:''' Don't forget &mdash; {{color|buzzword|pink skin, purple horns}}!
;(Proceed to next section)
----
;(If the player has found none of the Tatankasaurs)
:{{DIcon}} I'll keep an eye out.
:'''Urubamba:''' Thank you, kind soul. May your bench press today hit a new personal best and your pull-ups stay cramp-free!

;(If the player has found some of the Tatankasaurs)
:{{DIcon}} I found a few.
:'''Urubamba:''' Thank you, kind soul. Thank goodness they're okay, I was so worried!
:'''Urubamba:''' But there's still some missing. *sigh* I'd really appreciate it if you could have another look around. If you see them, please bring them back.

;(If the player has found all of the Tatankasaurs)
:{{DIcon}} They're all back.
:'''Urubamba:''' Was it you who brought them back? Honestly, I can't thank you enough! Here, please help yourself to the rewards in these chests.
:'''Urubamba:''' I'll head over to see them right away. Oh little saurians, my little saurians!

===Dialogue While Finding the Saurians===
{{Dialogue Start}}
The three playing with the [[Secret Source Dragon Cannon]]:
;(Approach the Secret Source Dragon Cannon)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} Rawr!<!-- The saurian riding the Cannon -->

;(After disabling the Secret Source Dragon Cannon)
:'''Paimon:''' You shouldn't be out here running around and climbing all willy-nilly &mdash; this place is dangerous! Now that you're all safe, it's time to go home.
;(The 3 little Tatankasaurs run home)

The one being chased by a single hilichurl:
;(After defeating the hilichurl)
:'''Paimon:''' Are you all shook up from those nasty mean hilichurls? There's no need to thank us, you just run along home.
:{{DIcon|Idle}} Rawr... Rrrooo...
;(The little Tatankasaur runs home)

The one chasing the little Tepetlisaur:
;(After catching the little Tatankasaur)
:'''Paimon:''' This little Tatankasaurus seems to be having fun chasing that [[Tepetlisaur Whelp|baby Tepetlisaurus]], but Paimon can't see its Mommy or Daddy anywhere nearby. C'mon, little guy, don't get so carried away playing that you can't find your way home.
<!-- Black screen transition-->
;(The little Tatankasaur runs home)

The one chasing the [[Matador Monetoo]]:
;(After catching the Matador Monetoo)
:'''Paimon:''' This lil' rascal's too much! If you're going to play, play nicely &mdash; there's no need to bully the other saurians. Come on, it's time to go home.
;(The little Tatankasaur runs home)

The one being cornered by hilichurls:
;(After defeating the hilichurls)
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, the valiant {{Traveler}} and intrepid Paimon have already chased away those meanie-weanies. There's nothing left to be afraid of.
;(The little Tatankasaur runs home)

The one caged in the hilichurl camp:
;(After clearing the hilichurl camp)
:'''Paimon:''' You're free now! Come on, don't hang around in this nasty old place.
:{{DIcon|Idle}} Rawr... Rrrooo...
;(The little Tatankasaur runs home)

After finding all of them:
:'''Paimon:''' We bumped into so many little pink Tatankasaurs on our way here, though they've probably all gone home by now. If you know where they live, we'll drop by and check in sometime.
