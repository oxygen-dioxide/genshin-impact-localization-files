|desc_1      = Summons 5 orbs that revolve around itself, repeatedly dealing '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} upon contact. Repeated hits have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]]. The orbs eventually explode, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.

|name_2      = Rotor Spin
|desc_2      = Performs a spinning attack, dealing '''20% ATK × 3''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. Additionally, summons 6 lightning strikes around the edge of the spin's area, each dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* '''Local Legend:''' Also spawns 6 Duskgrace Orbs around the arena. Picking up all 6 Duskgrace Orbs will form a Duskgrace Altar. Approaching the Local Legend while the Altar is active will briefly stun it and remove its extra [[RES]]. After some time, the Local Legend will absorb all Duskgrace Orbs not collected by the player.

* While the Arena is active:
** Characters within it lose all [[Energy]] and cannot gain Energy.
** Characters within it deal '''120%''' increased DMG, and [[Nightsoul's Blessing|Nightsoul]]-aligned DMG is additionally increased by '''60%'''.
** The Wayob Manifestation summons electric walls that move outward in a X-shaped pattern 3 times, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* If the Arena's duration ends and the shield is not destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation causes a massive blast, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}, and converts the remaining percentage of its shield to a {{Electro}} elemental shield.{{Elemental Shield Data|Electro|24|Maximum}}
* If the non-elemental shield is destroyed before the Arena's duration ends, a massive amount of Elemental Particles will spawn, restoring '''90''' base Energy. The actual amount restored will vary based on [[Energy Recharge]], whether the character is on or off-field, and the number of characters in the party.
* When either shield is active, the Wayob Manifestation is immune to all DMG.
* When either shield is destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation becomes paralyzed for 5 seconds.
* '''Local Legend:''' This ability is disabled.

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Ward
|desc_1      = Upon absorbing a Duskgrace Orb, restores durablity to an {{Electro}} Ward that further reduces DMG taken.

|name_2      = Duskgrace Storm
|desc_2      = At the center of the arena, continuously summons Duskgrace Orbs and pulls them towards itself to absorb them. Transforms into a ball of energy that repeatedly deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} upon contact. After some time, releases a massive blast that downs the active character unless they are protected by a Pilgrim's Shield. The player can intercept the orbs to prevent them from being absorbed, and will gain the following effects depending on the amount intercepted:
* 6 Orbs: Forms a Duskgrace Altar that can be used after this attack ends to briefly stun the Local Legend and remove its extra RES.
* 10 Orbs: Forms a Pilgrim's Shield that blocks all DMG as well as the finisher.
* 10+ Orbs: Each orb picked up after the 10th will deal {{Color|True Physical DMG}} equal to '''5%''' of its Max HP to the Local Legend and reduce its Ward if present.

{{Description|The Collective of Plenty believe in and worship the Wayob, which manifests upon the land with the power of totems and Nightsouls.<br>According to tribal legend, the Wayob has taken on countless forms. In the dim, pre-dawn darkness, where faces were hidden in shadows, the Wayob would wrestle with the mightiest tribal warriors, with neither side prevailing. The Collective of Plenty believe their Wayob has the power to control thunder and speed, and can bestow abundant harvests upon the land.|[[Archive]]}}
