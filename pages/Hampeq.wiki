{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hampeq:''' If I had tried another way...
:{{DIcon}} About the Hawkwings...
::'''Hampeq:''' We'd already been scattered like grains of sand, but now... Well, why bring it up again? You might as well just see it as having ceased to exist... In fact, it has indeed ceased to exist.
::'''Hampeq:''' I wanted to protect it, even if it meant resorting to a few underhand tricks &mdash; that was how much it meant to me. Little did I know, however, that it was precisely this that brought about our downfall...
:{{DIcon}} About the Locusts...
::'''Hampeq:''' You're not here to taunt me, are you?
::'''Hampeq:''' Of course, in a minor sense, they've been affected too. But that counts for nothing compared to what I've been through.
::'''Hampeq:''' Perhaps I should just be a better loser and leave this place as soon as I can...
:{{DIcon}} I shan't disturb you any longer.
::'''Hampeq:''' Goodbye...
