{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Baiji:''' When I first saw you, I thought that you must be some sort of local [[adeptus]]. Sorry about that, really...
:'''Siora:''' It's fine. The adepti in the legends you told me about seem really amazing! It is my honor to have been considered one of them.
:'''Baiji:''' Hehe, all's well so long as you don't mind. I'd be real saddened if someone as small and cute as you were to dislike me.
:'''Siora:''' Well, I do look quite small, sure, but I'm at least a few hundred years old.
:'''Baiji:''' Eh!?
:'''Siora:''' Hehe, this must be your first time in Fontaine, right? Do you need me to introduce you to some local habits and customs?
:'''Siora:''' Consider it thanks for telling me stories of Liyue.
:'''Baiji:''' W&mdash;Would you really? Thank you, Melu... sine? Is that how you pronounce that?
:'''Siora:''' Yup, your pronunciation's great! Well, then, let's start.
{{Dialogue End}}

== Trivia ==

=== Etymology ===

* Based on its Chinese pronunciation, and given that Melusines are named after fairy figures, "Siora" may be derived from {{W|Aos sí}} - often shortened as ''sídhe -'' a race of fairy-like beings in Celtic mythology.
