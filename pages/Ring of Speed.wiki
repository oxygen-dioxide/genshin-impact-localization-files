'''Ring of Speed''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Atocpan]], [[Natlan]]. Passing through one as a [[Collective of Plenty]] character or while [[indwelling]] a [[Tatankasaur]] will fully refill their [[Phlogiston]] meter and automatically trigger their special sprint. It has no effect on other characters and [[saurian]]s.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Collective of Plenty characters will enter the [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state, similarly to Nightsoul Transmission, except with 0 Nightsoul Points.
* Some Rings of Speed occur as part of a sequence &mdash; until the Ring on either end is entered, the middle Rings will not appear.
* Rings of Speed can be activated from any angle (they will not course-correct).
* Rings of Speed will not despawn after use.

==Trivia==
* There is an analogous mechanic in [[Ancient Sacred Mountain]], with the sole difference being that it must be approached from a specific direction. Given the similarity, it is possible that the "unknown origin" of the Ring of Speed's power lies with the ancient [[dragon]]s.
* The first and last Rings of Speed in a sequence appear wider than those in between.
