:'''Esteban:''' Hmm... This will be tricky...
:{{DIcon}} Hello there. You're...
::'''Esteban:''' Hmm? Oh, sorry, I was thinking about a certain problem earlier...
::'''Esteban:''' I'm a court stenographer. I happen to be done with work at the moment... But do you have anything else for me?
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the trial courts...
::;(Before completing [[Masquerade of the Guilty]])
:::'''Esteban:''' You won't find the court here. Pursuit of criminal cases takes place at the [[Opera Epiclese]] on [[Erinnyes]].
:::'''Esteban:''' That is the home of the divine judge, the mechanism known as the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]], the second layer of insurance behind the judges themselves.
:::'''Esteban:''' Well, I'm just a stenographer, so that's what I do &mdash; record the proceedings within the opera house.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the courtroom...
::;(After completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
:::'''Esteban:''' You won't find any courtrooms here. Criminal cases are heard in the Opera Epiclese on Erinnyes.
:::'''Esteban:''' Hmm... I always feel something's missing without the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale and Lady Furina. But the court is hearing cases as usual.
:::'''Esteban:''' The atmosphere of the court won't affect the fairness of the proceedings.
:::'''Esteban:''' Well, I'm just a stenographer, so that's what I do &mdash; record the proceedings within the opera house.
::{{DIcon}} What's troubling you?
:::'''Esteban:''' Well, judging cases is not under my purview, but having seen my fair share of trials, I can't help but think of how I should handle various dilemmas...
:::'''Esteban:''' Between the process and the result, which is more important?
:::'''Esteban:''' Is there a way to balance reason and jurisprudence?
:::'''Esteban:''' Between infinite time and infinite Mora, which would I choose?
:::'''Esteban:''' ...Oh, sorry, I'm all over the place, aren't I? Heh, not that these issues have anything to do with me, either...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Esteban:''' It's no trouble. See you.
