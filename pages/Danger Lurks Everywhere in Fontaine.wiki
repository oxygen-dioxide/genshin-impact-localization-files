{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Guijarro)
:'''Guijarro:''' It can't be... It can't be...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:'''Guijarro:''' Ah! No! I swear I didn't do anything, please don't hurt me!
:'''Paimon:''' What are you talking about? Why would we want to hurt you?
:'''Guijarro:''' I don't know! But I also don't know that you won't really hurt me!
:{{DIcon}} You're not making any sense...
:{{DIcon}} What are you talking about?
:'''Guijarro:''' Oh!&nbsp;...I've got it! It must be because I discovered your secret, right?
:'''Guijarro:''' I... I took the newspaper with your secret letter hidden inside it in the coffee shop?
:'''Guijarro:''' Or because I accidentally discovered your passphrase? Wait a moment, could it be that the fish I ate last night...
:'''Guijarro:''' I say, the reason that the fish had so few bones is because you already deboned that fish!
:'''Guijarro:''' Yes, yes, you wish to use the difference in the number of bones in each fish to send a message... But I accidentally bought this one and brought it back home with me...
:'''Paimon:''' What the heck is this guy talking about? Paimon can't make heads or tails of it...
:{{DIcon}} I won't hurt you.
:{{DIcon}} Don't be so paranoid.
:'''Guijarro:''' Y&mdash;You really aren't out to hurt me?
:'''Paimon:''' What's with you!? We've only just met you, why would we want to hurt you?
:'''Guijarro:''' R&mdash;Really? I'm... I'm glad. And I'm really sorry, how embarrassing...
:'''Guijarro:''' I've been working hard on a detective novel recently, but I still don't know what methodology the criminal should use to commit their crime!
:'''Guijarro:''' And because I am always overthinking things, so... Now when I look at anything, my first reaction is to consider how it could be used to... you know, commit crimes.
:'''Guijarro:''' *sigh* That's why I was... so nervous just now. I truly am sorry. Maybe I have become what they call "paranoid" now.
:'''Guijarro:''' I was about to ride the aquabus into the city for a cup of coffee, but when I saw aquabus running...
:'''Guijarro:''' I... I immediately saw countless possibilities, all the ways I could be killed on an aquabus! I simply didn't dare to board.
:{{DIcon}} You said yourself it was only paranoia.
:{{DIcon}} There's no way that'd happen, stop overthinking it.
:'''Guijarro:''' That may be so. But I simply cannot stop thinking about it, and the more I think, the more afraid I become...
:{{DIcon}} I'll accompany you...
:{{DIcon}} I'll escort you there.
:'''Guijarro:''' Really!? Amazing, but... What if the people who want to hurt me hurt you too?
:{{DIcon}} You just try to relax...
:'''Paimon:''' Come on, come on! Stop overthinking it. No matter what the problem is, {{Traveler}} can handle it, easy peasy!
----
;(Approach the aquabus stop)
:'''Guijarro:''' The aquabus is just over there... We'll board together in a bit.
:;(The Traveler, Paimon, and Guijarro board the aquabus)
:'''Paimon:''' ...Hey! Why are you crouching on the ground holding your head?
:'''Paimon:''' Did you hit your head or something? But there isn't anything here to hit your head on...
:'''Guijarro:''' Shh! Get over here! Lie down next to me! It's dangerous here...
:'''Paimon:''' Here we go again...
:'''Guijarro:''' This aquabus doesn't have any kind of barrier on top! If you place two poles on either side, and run fishing line between them...
:'''Guijarro:''' Then when the aquabus passes through, that fishing line will suddenly become a knife that...
:'''Paimon:''' Aaaah! Stop! Don't say any more!
:'''Guijarro:''' No, no, you don't even need two poles! One would be enough...
:'''Guijarro:''' And if you hung up some fishing line on it, with the hook just dangling there...
:'''Guijarro:''' Then the people on the aquabus would naturally be hooked, and left hanging in the air, and then...
:'''Paimon:''' Not listening not listening not listening... Paimon's not listening, lalalala!
:'''Paimon:''' After listening to her this whole time, even Paimon's getting kinda scared...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's get off the aquabus as soon as we arrive at the station, alright?
:{{Black Screen|You carefully disembark from the ship with Guijarro...}}

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Guijarro:''' Phew... Nothing happened, and I'm still alive. Wonderful!
:'''Paimon:''' Of course we're fine! We said it was all your paranoia.
:'''Guijarro:''' No, we still have not yet reached our destination. It is far too early for such a conclusion.
:'''Guijarro:''' What if... No! W&ndash;We must hurry! Just in case.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Why are you hiding again? There's nothing around here!
:'''Guijarro:''' Can't you see that Gardemek? It's right in front of us!
:{{DIcon}} Is something wrong with it?
:{{DIcon}} Uh... and?
:'''Guijarro:''' Shh! Quick, get out of there! What if it goes out of control?
:'''Guijarro:''' Or maybe its... its power core will suddenly explode! Or someone controlling it remotely will use it to attack us?
:{{DIcon}} It looks completely normal to me.
:'''Guijarro:''' That is exactly what makes me so scared! A meka that is operating normally suddenly losing control, and some poor unfortunate sop suddenly losing their life...
:'''Guijarro:''' Nobody would even be held responsible for such a thing! Perhaps the true culprit would never be found... No, it's simply too dangerous!
:'''Paimon:''' It already left, you can come out now!
:'''Guijarro:''' Phew... It didn't go out of control, truly unexpected. Our lives have been spared yet again.
:{{DIcon}} That kind of accident just isn't possible.
:{{DIcon}} It wasn't going to go berserk in the first place, capeesh?
:'''Guijarro:''' What I was thinking of, was more of an "intentional accident."
:'''Guijarro:''' Wait. But criminal events without a culprit... A crime that no individual will be held solely responsible for...
:'''Guijarro:''' That's it! Inspiration has struck! Quickly, quickly, to the café! I must write this down!

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Slow down, aren't you worried someone'll toss a rock and trip you or something?
----
;(Approach [[Café Lutece]])
:'''Guijarro:''' Ah, right... That's true...
:{{DIcon}} Coffee's getting cold.
:{{DIcon}} We're already finished drinking.
:'''Guijarro:''' Well, thank you, {{Traveler}}. And thank you for escorting me here.
:'''Paimon:''' You say "escort," but all we did was walk with you here. We didn't do anything!
:{{DIcon}} Nothing bad happened.
:{{DIcon}} And you encountered no danger.
:'''Guijarro:''' Yes. It appears I really was overthinking it...
:'''Guijarro:''' This coffee is really great, haha... ha...
:'''Guijarro:''' ...So, do you think it's poisoned?
:{{DIcon}} ...*psfffsh*
:{{DIcon}} Would it kill you not to say things like that for two seconds!?
:'''Paimon:''' Stop saying that kind of baloney! We finished drinking already, and we're fine, right?
:'''Guijarro:''' No, no, no, perhaps it is a... special sort of poisoning.
:'''Guijarro:''' First, the poisoner mixes a kind of medicine into our coffee.
:'''Guijarro:''' Drinking that medicine alone will have no effect whatsoever on the victim.
:'''Guijarro:''' After we have finished our poisoned drinks and gone home, the poisoner will follow us...
:'''Guijarro:''' And as we sleep, he will enter our room, and mix a second kind of medicine into your water bottle.
:'''Guijarro:''' The next day, after you're out and about, you'll take a drink from your water bottle. Then, the two medicines will mix and react within your body.
:'''Guijarro:''' And then we'll...
:{{Black Screen|The sound of hurried footsteps suddenly draws near...}}
:'''Arouet:''' My dear customer, just what are you saying?
:'''Arouet:''' Coffee? Poisoned? Please do not make such jests in my establishment!
:'''Arouet:''' Should your japes affect the other customers, I shall have to ask you to leave!
:{{DIcon}} Sir, allow me to explain...
:{{DIcon}} She's a friend of mine.
:{{Black Screen|You explain Guijarro's situation to Arouet. After listening, he leaves, exasperated...}}
:{{Black Screen|By way of apology, Guijarro buys another three cups of coffee...}}
:'''Paimon:''' You watched him make the coffee this time! There's no way there could be a problem with it.
:{{DIcon}} Stop imagining things.
:'''Guijarro:''' I know, I know, but... I did find a lot of inspiration along the way.
:'''Guijarro:''' If I just put it all together, I'm sure I can think of how the perfect crime &mdash; one that leaves no trace &mdash; could be committed!
:'''Guijarro:''' After I finish writing the book, I'll be sure to send you a copy.
:'''Guijarro:''' But before that, let me finish this cup of coffee, this cup... of coffee...
:'''Guijarro:''' Uh, {{Traveler}}, do you think... Is it at all possible...
:{{DIcon}} Shut it!
:{{DIcon}} Just stop right there!
:'''Guijarro:''' Could this cup itself have poison on it!?

==Trivia==
*The scenario described by Guijarro during the aquabus ride is likely a reference to Operation Guzheng in the science fiction novel ''{{w|The Three-Body Problem (novel)|The Three-Body Problem}}''.
