{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jiaming:''' Well, mining operations have resumed, but we probably need to post up around here for a while more.
:{{DIcon}} Still?
::'''Jiaming:''' Yes, that's right. I mean, this place was just recently rescued from a most chaotic situation. There's still ample opportunity for some parties to come in and cause chaos.
::'''Jiaming:''' Well, but we do have some lucky sods being transferred back to Liyue already, like that You Jun.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your hard work.
::'''Jiaming:''' Well, it's not like it can be helped. Better safe than sorry, as they say. In any case, we can't have another disaster here at The Chasm. We owe you a ton of thanks as well for solving the problem this time. Though I stand guard here, I do so with a hopeful heart for our future.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Jiaming:''' Bye. The Millelith will not forget your contributions.
