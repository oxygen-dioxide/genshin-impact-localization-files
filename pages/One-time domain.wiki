'''One-Time Domains''' are unique [[Domains]] that are denoted by a smaller blue circle on the [[Map]] that provide a set reward upon the first time a player completes them. They are still open after the first completion but will not offer any rewards. One-Time Domains provide an early boost to [[Adventure Rank]] through their [[Adventure EXP]] rewards and sometimes offer unique [[Food]] recipes, along with [[Primogem]]s.

Until the area they are in is revealed by unlocking the corresponding [[Statue of The Seven]], One-Time Domains do not show up on the map and cannot be teleported to, even if they have been unlocked.

One-Time Domains may be completed as soon as they are unlocked. Some can be unlocked immediately, while others cannot be unlocked until a puzzle in the area is solved.
