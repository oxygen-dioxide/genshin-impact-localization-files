<!--{{Quest Description|update|After arriving in the Fortress of Meropide, you need to ask Monglane about the situation...}}-->
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Get spotted by a Fortress searchlight)
:'''Paimon:''' Gah! It hurts Paimon's eyes! Paimon's got a bad feeling, {{Traveler}}, let's get out of here fast!

;(Escape the searchlight's sight, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' It should be safe now, right? But we still shouldn't get too close...

;(Stay in the searchlight's sight)
:{{Black Screen|You have remained inside the light's detection range for too long. The Fortress of Meropide's guards have detained you for being suspicious.}}

;(Get spotted by Galvana)
:'''Galvana:''' I knew that wouldn't be the end of the problem. People like you just keep appearing, don't you? What's that idiot Clynes doing anyway &mdash; isn't he supposed to come up with solutions?
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a moment, we're...
:'''Galvana:''' Alright, if you've got questions about processes or documents, I don't want to hear them. Can't fix 'em, anyway. Go look for Monglane instead. She's the one in charge of that.
:{{Black Screen|You are taken to the reception area...}}
----
;(Talk to Monglane)
:'''Monglane:''' Your name.
:{{DIcon}} Yours first.
::'''Monglane:''' I'm a receptionist here at the Fortress of Meropide. Everyone calls me Monglane. Alright, your turn.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon's Paimon, and {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} Just call me {{Traveler}}.
::'''Paimon:''' And you can call Paimon Paimon... *cough* Gah, lowering our voices didn't make us sound more serious at all. In fact, we sound super weird!
:'''Monglane:''' {{Traveler}} and Paimon, huh... Never heard of you two. Are you really from around these parts?
:{{DIcon}} Well, we're here, aren't we?
::'''Monglane:''' Yes, I can see that.
:{{DIcon}} My great name is unknown to you, huh...
::'''Monglane:''' Well, I do know the main culprits involved in major cases... Are you accessories to one of those crimes?
::'''Paimon:''' Accessories? What? Th&mdash;That's not right! We're good people!
::'''Monglane:''' Ah, I see, noted.
::'''Paimon:''' It sure doesn't sound like you're "noting" anything...
:'''Monglane:''' Two names missing... It seems like someone's been slacking off. I'll have to record this. Those who didn't fill the forms in properly will face the relevant consequences...
:'''Monglane:''' Anyway, this isn't your fault. No need to worry.
:'''Monglane:''' As long as you follow the rules and behave well, you might even have the chance to leave early. You just need to fill the application form and wait patiently for it to be approved.
:{{DIcon}} Wait a moment, that's not what I'm talking about...
::'''Paimon:''' Speaking of that... Did we just complete some sorta procedures? This is going way too fast &mdash; Paimon's got no idea what's happening...
:{{DIcon}} Fine.
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, what? This isn't "fine"! Wait, do you already know what's going on? Paimon doesn't get it at all...
:'''Paimon:''' There's gotta be some kinda misunderstanding...
:'''Monglane:''' If you want your case reviewed, please fill the application form in according to this format. That said, the time for that has passed for now, so you'll have to wait for the next application window to open.
:'''Monglane:''' If you have any other questions... Ask Darcy. He should be nearby. I'm sure he'll be glad to have a newbie to talk to.
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|You spoke with Monglane, but still have many questions. Perhaps this man called "Darcy" can help...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Darcy)
;(If ''[[To the Stars Shining in the Depths]]'' was completed){{Verify|Is there a specific quest?}}
::'''Darcy:''' Hello, {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}, and hello to your cute companion! Dirty Face Darcy, at your service!
::{{DIcon}} Dirty Face?
::'''Darcy:''' That's right, just call me Dirty Face Darcy. They used to call me Pretty Face on the outside... but that nickname is just so lame!
::'''Darcy:''' Please, just call me Dirty Face instead... Oh, that's just a cool nickname, I wash my face every day. You don't have to stand all the way over there...
::{{DIcon}} Any news?
::{{DIcon}} Where's the action at?
:::'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, where'd you learn to talk like that? Don't tell Paimon... Don't tell Paimon you've picked up some bad habits... No way! Paimon won't allow it!
::'''Darcy:''' Too bad it's not time for Pankration yet... Let me think.
::'''Darcy:''' How about this, why don't I take you to have some fun? A few folks have locked horns over the chance to go outside. I had no idea those [[Fontaine Research Institute]] guys could dish it out like that...
::'''Darcy:''' I'm guessing they'll be here any minute now... What do you think? Think of it as an opening act before the real Pankration match starts. Wanna check it out?
::{{DIcon}} Okay, let's go, then.
:::'''Darcy:''' Let's go!
::{{DIcon}} Let's talk about this later.
:::'''Darcy:''' Just think of it as killing time. Anyway, come find me when you make a decision, and I'll take you to meet Estienne, my guard partner!

;(If ''To the Stars Shining in the Depths'' was not completed){{Verify|This dialogue may still appear after completing the Archon Quest.<!--Probably because this quest was started before Archon quest-->}}
::'''Darcy:''' Newcomers? And two of you, to boot? Welcome! Welcome to the Fortress of Meropide! I'm Darcy. Outside, they call me "Pretty Face," but that's just not cool, if you know what I mean!
::'''Darcy:''' That's what you were thinking too, right? That's why I decided to give myself a new, super cool nickname! I'm called Dirty Face now! What do you think? Pretty sick, right?
::{{DIcon}} No comment.
::{{DIcon}} Honorary Knight sounds cooler.
:::'''Paimon:''' It is a generally recognized title, after all. Just thinking about it fills Paimon with courage.
::'''Paimon:''' More importantly, we have some questions...
::'''Darcy:''' Ooh, of course! It's perfectly normal for newcomers to not know what's going on. Dirty Face Darcy, at your service!
::'''Darcy:''' Go ahead, ask me anything!
::{{DIcon}} What is this place?
:::'''Darcy:''' Haha, you came here and you don't even know what this place is? Oh, based on how you're dressed, I don't suppose you're Fontainians. Alright, looks like you really could use an introduction.
:::'''Darcy:''' For-tress-of-Me-ro-pi-de. Got it? This is the Fortress of Meropide. Anyone can get into a regular routine and live a carefree life here. Pretty sweet, right?
::;(Return to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} Why are you here?
:::'''Darcy:''' What, you want to hear the tale of "Pretty Face Darcy"? Why don't we go sit in the [[Coupon Cafeteria]] for a bit then? It's a long story, after all, so I'll need some time to tell it.
:::'''Darcy:''' I'll treat you to some [[Fonta]]... Wait, that's not right. I'll be the one telling the story, so it's you who should be treating me to a Fonta. Although, newcomers won't have any Coupons... In that case, you'll owe me two Fontas.
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why would we owe you a drink for telling your own story, let alone two? We don't want to hear it, then.
:::'''Darcy:''' Really? Are you sure? *sigh* That's too bad. Pretty Face might be a lame nickname, but all kinds of stuff happened back when people called me that...
:::'''Darcy:''' But it's fine. If you regret it later and decide you do want to hear my story, I'll move it up in my schedule. You know where to find me, right? Right here!
::;(Return to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} Why am I here?
:::'''Darcy:''' Huh? That's what you want to ask me? Wait, I get it, you want me to guess, right? You don't look like evil villains, so you definitely didn't do anything serious...
:::'''Darcy:''' Did you steal or damage some precious cultural relics? No, that can't be it. Did you collaborate with some bad actors and disturb the peace? Hmm, maybe not, actually. Something more minor... Ooh, you didn't pull a dine-and-dash, did you?
:::{{DIcon}} It was Paimon, she ate it all.
:::'''Paimon:''' *gasp* How could you say that! You clearly ate a lot of it too, {{Traveler}}... But no, we didn't dine and dash!
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon has no idea what happened to land us here...
:::{{Black Screen|You tell Darcy all about what happened before...}}
:::'''Darcy:''' Oh! Well, in that case, all you can do is apply to have your case re-examined. But, as Ms. Monglane said, the window for that has passed. You'll just have to wait until the next opportunity comes up.
:::'''Darcy:''' Also, you'll want to make sure you fill out the form correctly. If you get anything wrong, your application will be flat-out rejected. You may not have known that, being new here and all...
:::'''Darcy:''' Don't be fooled by her appearance, she's a real nag about document formatting. There's no room for error with her, not even for the guards.
::;(Return to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} What can I do here?
:::'''Darcy:''' Live, work, play &mdash; whatever you feel like. Trying to get some sun might be tricky though, haha. That said, it wouldn't be completely impossible, either.
:::'''Darcy:''' If you're interested in getting some sun, I could bring you to see a few people... Oh, I mean real sun, of course, not the searchlights...
:::'''Darcy:''' Um... Unless you're actually the type that prefers the searchlights? I'm not one to yuck anyone's yum, but try not to get burned.
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't understand any of what you're saying right now... But does getting real sun mean getting out of this place? If that's the case, count us in!
:::'''Darcy:''' Missing the sunshine outside already? Alright, I'll take you to see Estienne in a bit. Hmm, I think we can still make it in time? Well, let's go ask him first.
::;(Return to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} Heard any interesting rumors?
:::'''Darcy:''' I heard Alvard's got his hands on some rare stuff. If you're interested, you could go to his Rag and Bone Shop and ask. Maybe he'll let you take a look.
:::'''Darcy:''' Also, that new guard, what's his name... [[Noailles]]. I heard he doesn't like Fonta! What a stick in the mud... Not only that, he also wants to shut down the [[Pankration Ring]]. Tch.
::;(Return to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} That's all I wanted to ask.
::'''Darcy:''' Alright. If you have any more questions, just come find me. Dirty Face Darcy is at your service!
::'''Darcy:''' For now, why don't I take you to see Estienne? He's a guard, but he's cool, if you catch my drift!
::'''Darcy:''' One time in the Pankration Ring, he slipped me a bottle of [[Pure Water]] before I got in the ring! I still lost in the end, though...
::'''Darcy:''' Anyway, he's one of the good ones. Whenever there's trouble, he'll take care of it. So? Wanna go see him now?
::{{DIcon}} What are we waiting for? Let's go!
:::'''Darcy:''' Let's go!
::{{DIcon}} I can't keep up... Let me think.
:::'''Paimon:''' You're going too fast, let us think about this a little...
:::'''Darcy:''' Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to make you come with me. Take your time, and come find me when you make a decision!

;(Talk to Darcy again, if the conversation was exited)
:'''Darcy:''' Well? Want to go find Estienne with me now?
:{{DIcon}} Then let's get going.
::'''Darcy:''' Let's go!
:{{DIcon}} Let me think about it first.
::'''Darcy:''' Sure thing!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Darcy said the guard Estienne may be able to help. Go see him.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Estienne, Genevieve, and Rave)
:'''Darcy:''' Hi, Estienne. I've brought two new friends with me.
:'''Estienne:''' Your new friends may have come at a bad time. See that? They're gonna be at it for a while.
:'''???:''' ...That's an unscientific way of keeping score. Besides, the participants were unsupervised. Is that any way to produce convincing results? I'm calling for a reassessment.
:'''???:''' This is a competition, of course we should have a refined system and fair rules. Participants who don't follow the rules should be disqualified.
:'''???:''' You talk a good game. I'd expect nothing less from someone who's been through the wringer.
:'''???:''' If you're referring to the fraudulent thesis case, I've already made my point several times now. The case is still under investigation. It's useless to try and attack my character with something like that.
:'''???:''' If you say so. After all, you're the only one who knows the truth.
:'''Darcy:''' Oh, it's Genevieve and Rave again. I'll talk to you about my thing later then, I'm gonna bounce for now... I'll leave my two new friends to you!
:{{Black Screen|Darcy makes a dash for it...}}
:'''Paimon:''' He left us, just like that? Some guide, Paimon gives him zero stars! Zero!
:'''Genevieve:''' Mr. Guard, as the organizer, it's not exactly proper for you to stay out of this discussion of the rules, is it?
:'''Estienne:''' Haha, this is just a game to pass the time. How was I supposed to know you'd all get so riled up over it... let alone take it this seriously.
:'''Estienne:''' Right, why don't we introduce the rules of the game to the new players?
:{{DIcon}} A game? I'm definitely gonna win.
::'''Paimon:''' Heh, there's no game the two of us can't win! Wait a sec, we still don't know what the game even is yet...
:{{DIcon}} I haven't agreed to play yet.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right, we don't even know what this game is. If it's an eating competition, Paimon will absolutely play! But if it's some sort of game involving a lot of hard work and very little reward... then you can forget about it!
:'''Genevieve:''' Don't try and change the subject! We're already halfway through the game, and they don't even know the fundamental rules. They can't just join in now.
:{{DIcon}} So, what are you guys playing?
:'''Genevieve:''' Coupon Millionaire.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon has never heard of such a game...
:'''Rave:''' Of course not, this is just what the heartless guards play to make fun of us. Everyone loses, and I'm sure you know who wins.
:'''Estienne:''' That's not true. You work to earn Coupons during the game, and the one that has the most Coupons will get an even better reward from me.
:'''Estienne:''' So everyone wins, but one person wins more than the rest.
:'''Paimon:''' A reward better than Coupons? What could it be?
:'''Estienne:''' In Darcy's words, a chance to be under the sun. Some of our periodic checks need to be performed outside, and I get to decide who gets these jobs.
:'''Estienne:''' It wouldn't be very interesting if I just picked based on my preference.
:'''Estienne:''' So I created Coupon Millionaire, and those who want to go outside are free to sign up. Whoever gets the most Coupons wins the game.
:'''Estienne:''' If you feel that your strength alone will be insufficient, you can find others to group up with. As for how you earn Coupons... I don't care about that.
:'''Genevieve:''' As far as games go, the rules are really vague.
:'''Estienne:''' It's part of the strategy. Does the Fontaine Research Institute not have similar "games"?
:'''Genevieve:''' ...
:'''Estienne:''' How about you, Darcy's new friends?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, everyone, but I'm going to win.
:{{DIcon}} It's not very attractive...
:'''Rave:''' It's not impossible to come back from behind, but only those who have the means will be able to do it. As for them... Estienne, maybe you should arrange a special competition for children.
:'''Paimon:''' Children's competition...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't know who you are, but you shouldn't underestimate us. We've seen some... things! It's just a game, and we gonna cruise through it!
:;(A young girl speaks up)
:'''???:''' No, I will definitely be the biggest winner.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh wow, a real child! And a confident one, at all!
:'''???:''' That's what Cater said, and he's never lied to me.
:;(Another guard approaches)
:'''???:''' What are you all doing here?
:'''???:''' You again, Estienne?
:'''Estienne:''' I didn't break any rules, did I? In fact, I even increased everyone's work efficiency, and that should be to my credit.
:'''???:''' You know what I mean. Know your place, Estienne. You're a guard, and you should use your powers to make them obey you.
:'''Estienne:''' I have my way of doing things. And you, Noailles... It's been some time since you arrived here at the Fortress. You should try blending in a little more.
:'''Noailles:''' Laziness, apathy... I will restore order here, starting with you. Stop this gathering and go back to what you were doing!
:'''Noailles:''' I am not as lenient as Estienne. If I'm going to restore order, then punishments are a must. I don't think you want to know what they are.
:'''Estienne:''' ...Are there things that even I don't know?
:'''Estienne:''' I jest. You don't need to waste any of your time on this game that we play to kill time. The Fortress is huge, and I'm sure there are other things that require your attention.
:'''Noailles:''' I don't need you to remind me.
:{{Black Screen|Noailles leaves.<br>Genevieve and Rave return to their respective companions.<br>The girl also slips away without being noticed.}}
:'''Estienne:''' Finally... Being serious can be a virtue, but being overly serious... is something else.
:'''Estienne:''' Anyway, now that the annoying guy is gone, will you join the game, Darcy's new friends?
:'''Paimon:''' What sort of person leaves their friends behind, anyway? We aren't his friends! In fact, Paimon's gonna use his uncool nickname to address him! That "Pretty Face" is a jerk!
:'''Paimon:''' ...Huh? Wait a minute, that nickname doesn't sound all that mean...
:'''Estienne:''' Haha, alright, then. What should we call you?
:'''Paimon:''' Call me Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}. As for the game...
:{{DIcon}} We'll need more time to think about this.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe next time.
:'''Estienne:''' Sure. If you change your mind, please feel free to talk to me.

:'''Paimon:''' (Actually, where did that little girl go? Why are there children that young in Fort Meropide? That's strange...)
:'''Paimon:''' (Paimon's really intrigued! {{Traveler}}, shall we go look for her and talk to her?)

;(Talk to Estienne again, optional)
:'''Estienne:''' Come find me if you change your mind. We're already midway through the game though, so joining now means getting a late start. Still, that would make the game more interesting, wouldn't it?

;(Talk to Genevieve or Poiret, optional)
:'''Poiret:''' I told you it's a waste of time to talk to them about these things. They just don't care.
:'''Genevieve:''' You know we're not that kind of people. I can't reach conclusions intuitively like you. I have to do it before making a decision.

;(Talk to Darcy again, optional)
:'''Darcy:''' Dirty Face Darcy, at your service!
:'''Paimon:''' At whose service? And when? You ran off and left us behind back there!
:'''Darcy:''' I had to. Once that researcher starts talking, there's no end to it! It was fun the first time, but I've seen it too many times already.
:'''Darcy:''' That was your first time, right? Was it fun?
:{{DIcon}} Not at all.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't get the point, either.
:{{DIcon}} What an amazing debate.
::'''Paimon:''' Are you serious, {{Traveler}}?
:'''Darcy:''' Too bad the time for Pankration hasn't arrived yet. I think that's more fun! Anyway, we'll just have to wait.

;(Talk to Delassaux, optional)
:'''Delassaux:''' ...

;(Talk to Rave again, optional)
:'''Rave:''' Did you need me for something?
:{{DIcon}} Mind telling me about Estienne?
::'''Rave:''' The smiling ones are the ones you've really got to watch out for.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Genevieve...
::'''Rave:''' {{MC|m=You're not going to try to get that woman to listen to reason, are you?|f=You seem to have more sense than her.}}
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Noailles...
::'''Rave:''' I've got nothing to say about him.
:{{DIcon}} Never mind...
:'''Rave:''' ...You kids oughta head home. If you still have a home to go back to, that is.

;(Talk to Henaff, optional)
:'''Henaff:''' Got any Coupons, boss?
:{{DIcon}} Boss?
::'''Henaff:''' You're not the boss? Why didn't you say so?
:{{DIcon}} What's it to you?
::'''Henaff:''' You don't? Then I called you "boss" for nothing. What a waste.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|You discovered the strange little girl...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to the girl)
:'''Paimon:''' There you are!
:'''???:''' Oh, you again. And your, uh... Are you a bird, little one?
:'''Paimon:''' A bird? Paimon doesn't look like a bird...
:{{DIcon}} The way you keep talking...
::'''Paimon:''' You mean melodic chirping!
:{{DIcon}} Indeed, Paimon, you don't.
:'''???:''' That's so strange. You can fly, but you're not a bird. Are you an evil dragon? Or an evil dragonling?
:{{DIcon}} The way you eat and your thirst for wealth certainly fit the bill...
::'''Paimon:''' No they don't!
:{{DIcon}} She's not... Probably?
::'''Paimon:''' Why did you hesitate?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, {{sic|{{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s<!--capitalized-->}} {{Traveler}}, and Paimon's name is Paimon. What's your name?
:'''Lanoire:''' I'm... Lanoire. {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} and Ms. Paimon, will you please tell me whether the evil sorcerer is still there?
:'''Paimon:''' The evil sorcerer?
:'''Lanoire:''' Yes, with black clothes and a staff that has branches sticking out of it. Cater said that I mustn't get spotted by that sorcerer, or things will get very bad...
:{{DIcon}} Where is this wicked spellslinger? My sword is ready!
::'''Paimon:''' Why are you playing along? Paimon thinks she's talking about who we just saw.
:{{DIcon}} Was it the person that we just saw?
::'''Paimon:''' Yup, Paimon thinks so too.
:'''Paimon:''' Must've been a guard, right? So, who's this bad, bad sorcerer? Estienne, or Noailles?
:'''Lanoire:''' Estienne is a good sorcerer! He brought me flowers when he returned last time. They had the same color as my skirt!
:'''Lanoire:''' Then Cater taught me to put them into books to make pressed flowers. That way, my books would smell nice, too. Is this what they call the fragrance of knowledge?
:'''Paimon:''' Noailles, then.
:{{DIcon}} Estienne said he was annoying, too.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't like him, either. It seems he doesn't think very highly of us.
:{{DIcon}} No plot twists? Boring.
::'''Paimon:''' Just what kind of story are you looking for, anyway?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, the evil sorcerer's gone now. Still, why's a little kid like you in the Fortress of Meropide?
:'''Lanoire:''' I've always been here. Why does everyone ask me that? It's so strange.
:'''Lanoire:''' Don't you two have your own home, too?
:{{DIcon}} Home is where your family is.
:'''Lanoire:''' That's what Cater said, too, which is why I have a home that I don't know about.
:'''Paimon:''' How do you call a place that you don't know home?
:'''Lanoire:''' Wait, I can't? That's a toughie... But I'm sure Cater knows the answer. He knows lots of things, and a lot of stories!
:'''Paimon:''' Might Cater, by any chance, be a kid who looks about the same age as you?
:'''Lanoire:''' Nope, he's a lot taller than me, taller than {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, and taller than the evil sorcerer.
:'''Lanoire:''' But I think he's afraid of the evil sorcerer. He lost his sword, and the evil sorcerer has a powerful staff, so he hides when the evil sorcerer comes out.
:'''Paimon:''' (This Cater sounds... mysterious. And maybe Lanoire is just too young? She hasn't been very clear about herself at all. Maybe this Cater knows more?)
:{{DIcon}} (I guess we can go meet him.)
:'''Paimon:''' We want to meet Cater. Will you take us to see him?
:'''Lanoire:''' Sure, but... it's too soon to go back! I want to explore this place while the evil sorcerer isn't here. Will you come with me?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go!
::'''Lanoire:''' Hehe, let's go!
:{{DIcon}} Let's wait a little bit.
::'''Lanoire:''' Hmm... Then... Then I'll wait for you two here! Don't worry, I'm very patient!

;(Talk to Lanoire again, if "Let's wait a little bit" was chosen)
:'''Lanoire:''' Are you ready to go?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go!
::'''Lanoire:''' Hehe, let's go!
:{{DIcon}} I need a little more time.
::'''Lanoire:''' Sure.

;(After "Let's go" is chosen)
:'''Lanoire:''' The Bow-Wow-House is just up ahead. I've never been inside, though. Cater wouldn't let me.
:'''Lanoire:''' You can sometimes hear "bow-wow" sounds from inside... Maybe that's because there are a lot of furry monsters in there. It's a very dangerous place.
:'''Lanoire:''' I saw an evil sorcerer enter once, and the place became quiet quickly. That evil sorcerer must have been very powerful...

;(Follow Lanoire to Nizami)
:'''Nizami:''' Little Skylark? Why are you here? Careful now, or the evil sorcerer might catch you and put you in a cage!
:'''Lanoire:''' The evil sorcerer isn't here right now. I... I'm not afraid!
:'''Nizami:''' Haha! Good, good, attagirl!

;(Follow Lanoire to the punching bag)
:'''Lanoire:''' Those who come here frequently will walk around this thing in circles...
:'''Lanoire:''' Nizami said this is a boxing dummy. If you can't earn its approval, then you can't enter the Bow-Wow-House.

;(Talk to Nizami again, optional)
:'''Nizami:''' Tired from playing with those kids? You can spar with me after you've rested!
:{{DIcon}} I'm pretty strong, just to let you know.
::'''Nizami:''' The stronger the opponent, the better!
:{{DIcon}} Why do you want to spar with me?
::'''Nizami:''' Huh? How does the saying go again... "There's no substitute for the real thing"! Sparing with an actual person always beats punching dummies, don't you think?

:'''Lanoire:''' Wow! Now {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} can go take on the furry beasts!

;(After getting blinded by the spotlight)
:'''Lanoire:''' Ouch!
:'''Clynes:''' I'm sorry! Are you alright?
:'''Paimon:''' What happened?
:'''Lanoire:''' It's the evil sorcerer's magic! We'll be trapped if we get caught in it!
:'''Galvaryet:''' Sorry, the light's broken, and this expert here isn't anywhere near as good as he claimed...
:'''Clynes:''' I never said such a thing.
:'''Lanoire:''' Oh, it's you! It's alright, you're a good sorceress.
:'''Lanoire:''' But that bright light really hurt my eyes...

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Galvaryet:''' So you're not denying that you're an expert?
:'''Clynes:''' I would never.
:'''Galvaryet:''' That's not what you told Galvana.
:'''Clynes:''' You mean the thing about the Fontaine Research Institute? Well, she asked me first.

;(Talk to Galvaryet and Clynes, optional)
:'''Galvaryet:''' Will it take this long? You...
:'''Clynes:''' I want to be free of these bothersome affairs, too! Really, can you just... please use the devices according to the instructions?

;(Follow Lanoire to the speaker)
:'''Lanoire:''' The Fourth said that this is a noise box that transforms evil into good.
:'''Lanoire:''' Turning off the noise box elsewhere is very dangerous, because it might attract the evil sorcerer.

:'''Lanoire:''' Phew, guess our adventure's almost at an end. The Coupon Cafeteria's our final stop.
:{{DIcon}} So the ultimate destination of adventuring is a good meal.
:'''Paimon:''' Not bad, right? Adventures take a toll on your body, so eating afterward is a must.
:'''Lanoire:''' That's right! And I've never seen someone as small as Ms. Paimon! You're even smaller than Ms. [[Sigewinne]]. You should eat more, so you can grow bigger!
:{{DIcon}} I think Paimon's fine just the way she is.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so, too!
:{{DIcon}} The thought of Paimon growing up... Ugh, that gives me a headache.

::{{DIcon}} Well, that means we get no food. Oops.
::'''Lanoire:''' No, don't worry! Just talk to Bran, and you'll get a yummy free meal!
::'''Lanoire:''' Bran's the clockwork meka over there. It was broken, but [[Wolsey]] repaired it.
::'''Lanoire:''' You only get a free meal once per day, though, and you won't know what you'll get. The best thing you can get is the [[Tasses Ragout]].
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, you won't know what you'll get? Why can't you order what you want?
::'''Lanoire:''' Wolsey says that it's meant to be both a surprise and a risk precisely 'cause it's a free meal. If you don't want any risks, then you've gotta use Coupons.
::'''Lanoire:''' Will the two of you try the free meal?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon will give it a try! Paimon is always lucky, and this stuff's free! How can free meals be bad?

::'''Paimon:''' Let's talk to Bran and see if we'll get something good!
::'''Lanoire:''' Yup! It'd be nice if it was the delicious Tasses Ragout, though.

:'''Lanoire:''' Greetings, Bran.
:'''Bran:''' Greetings. What can I do for you?
:{{DIcon}} I'll have a free meal, please.
::'''Bran:''' Understood.
::'''Bran:''' Enjoy.
::'''Paimon:''' And Paimon, too!
::'''Bran:''' Enjoy.
:{{DIcon}} Two free meals, please.
::'''Bran:''' Negative. According to the "Fortress of Meropide's Coupon Cafeteria Regulations," only one free meal per day shall be permitted per person.
::{{DIcon}} I'm getting one for Paimon, too.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right, don't forget about Paimon!
::'''Bran:''' ...Understood.
::'''Bran:''' Enjoy.
:{{DIcon}} I'll have five hundred free meals.
::'''Bran:''' Negative. According to the "Fortress of Meropide's Coupon Cafeteria Regulations," only one free meal per day shall be permitted per person.

::'''Bran:''' ...Understood.
::'''Bran:''' Enjoy.
:'''Lanoire:''' I'll have one, too.
:'''Bran:''' Understood. Enjoy.
:'''Lanoire:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, let's open our meals together, alright? Three... Two... One!
:'''Lanoire:''' Wow, mine's Tasses Ragout!
:'''Lanoire:''' What did you two get?
:[[File:Game of the Rich Meal.png|200px]]
:{{DIcon}} Is there a pot? I'll cook my own meal.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't want to eat anymore.
:{{DIcon}} It certainly... looks... like food.
::'''Paimon:''' Wow, this looks kinda disgusting.
:'''Lanoire:''' So I got the only good meal? Will there be enough if we split it into three portions?
:'''Lanoire:''' There's even a fortune inside. What do yours say?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's fortune says, "Luck only brings fleeting pleasure, lifelong happiness requires hard work." ...Grr, now Paimon's mad!
:'''Paimon:''' How about you, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} "Things happen. Don't take it personally!"
:'''Paimon:''' Just... wow.
:'''Lanoire:''' Mine says, "Misfortune is an illness, and caring friends are the cure."
:'''Lanoire:''' The two of you went on adventures with me, so you're definitely caring friends... But you got the disgusting meals...
:'''Lanoire:''' The Sorceress said that I must remember to pay it forward. So now it's my turn to cure you!

;(Approach Alvard)
:'''Lanoire:''' Hello, Alvard!
:'''Alvard:''' Hey, Skylark, want a Fonta? We just got a new shipment. How about your friends?
:'''Paimon:''' So this is the Rag and Bone Shop.
:'''Alvard:''' If you have Coupons, we have everything from home supplies like Hydro Phantasm Taint-B-Gone...
:'''Alvard:''' ...To devices that can help you in the Pankration Ring. Our wares are trusted and loved by all and sundry! You name it, Rag and Bone Shop has it!
:{{DIcon}} We'll take some Hydro Phantasm Taint-B-Gone.
::'''Paimon:''' We don't really need this, do we?
:{{DIcon}} Devices that help you? What do you mean?
::'''Alvard:''' They're for regulars only. Or, if you happen to have friends who are our regulars, I suppose I can show them to you...
:'''Alvard:''' The special items must be pre-ordered, though. Or if you're lucky enough, you might find what you want on the for-sale list.
:'''Alvard:''' We do have the other stuff stocked at all times. So, back to my question. How about some Fonta?
:'''Lanoire:''' Hm, I want everything in Uncle Alvard's store.
:'''Alvard:''' That's not going to be a problem. Let's see... We're almost through with this shipment, and only food and drinks are left. But they'll cost you a good number of Coupons.
:'''Paimon:''' Really!? Are you sure it won't be a problem?
:'''Lanoire:''' Problem? If you mean Coupons, Cater gave me a ton of them, so I should have enough. The food and drinks here are really great, and you're going to love them, Ms. Paimon!
:'''Lanoire:''' Cater said that Coupons make unfair things fair. Only I got the delicious Tasses Ragout at the Coupon Cafeteria, and that was unfair.
:'''Lanoire:''' So now I'm going to use my Coupons to buy something delicious for the two of you!
:{{DIcon}} Time to eat, then!
::'''Lanoire:''' Let's dig in!
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, that was supposed to be my line, you two!
:{{DIcon}} Something doesn't feel right.
::'''Paimon:''' But Lanoire said there are plenty of delicious food and drinks...
:'''Lanoire:''' Estienne said that hunger and gross food reduce our work efficiency and put us in a bad mood.
:'''Lanoire:''' We're going to see Cater soon, and we wanna be in a good mood when we see him. That's why we need to fill our stomachs with delicious food.
:'''Lanoire:''' We're counting on you, Uncle Alvard.
:;(Opens the quest-exclusive [[Rag and Bone Shop#Quest-Only Shop Inventory|Rag and Bone Shop inventory]])
:'''Alvard:''' Sure. Thank you for the business!
:'''Paimon:''' If Lanoire says so... We'll dig in!

:{{Black Screen|Feasting with Lanoire...<br>Everything that couldn't be finished ends up in Paimon's pack.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Phew! That was amazing! Paimon's so full, she can barely walk. {{sic|she's<!--lowercased-->}} getting sleepy, too...
:'''Paimon:''' Why are we here again?
:{{DIcon}} If you can't remember, then maybe it wasn't important.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you here, Lanoire?
::'''Lanoire:''' That's a strange question! I've always been here.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers now! We're supposed to be looking for Cater.
:'''Lanoire:''' Let's go! But I don't know if he's there. If not, we can wait. He might be back soon.

;(Talk to Alvard, optional)
:'''Alvard:''' Welcome to the Rag and Bone Shop! We have everything... Oops, we don't have anything right now.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I need to buy something.

:{{DIcon}} I'm done.
::'''Alvard:''' We'll get a new shipment soon. Don't forget to come back!

;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Lanoire:''' Cater always tells me stories in the evening, so if he doesn't come back soon, just wait a bit, and he'll be back for sure!
:'''Paimon:''' He sounds like a great brother!
:'''Lanoire:''' Yeah! Cater is really good at telling stories! Oooh, oooh! And look at my braids! He braided them for me too, hehe.

;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Lanoire:''' Cater! I'm back.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Welcome back, Lanoire. Looks like you've made some friends.
:'''Lanoire:''' Yes, they're {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} and Ms. Paimon. Ms. Paimon is small and she can fly, but she's not a bird.
:'''Lanoire:''' She's not a [[Seelie]] either. Maybe a small [[Oceanid]]? No wonder no one has seen anything like her, or knows anything about her!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right, Paimon's just Paimon! She's not a Seelie or an Oceanid... Wait, you're "Cater"!?
:{{DIcon}} You look about the same age as Lanoire.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Nice to meet you, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon. Please call me Caterpillar.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Please don't be so formal. That feels so strange!
;(If [[An Artist Adrift (Part 3)|An Artist Adrift]] has been completed)
::'''Caterpillar:''' Since you're Lanoire's friends, sure, I can do that!
::'''Paimon:''' Wait a minute... We've heard the name "Caterpillar" before, haven't we?
::{{DIcon}} From who?
::{{DIcon}} Maybe from someone in [[Sumeru]].
::'''Paimon:''' Ah, that's right! [[Julien]]! The painter we met at [[Samudra Coast]]. Do you remember him? So you're the "Caterpillar" he mentioned!
::'''Caterpillar:''' You've met Julien? He really went to Sumeru, huh? How is he?
::'''Paimon:''' Well...
::{{Black Screen|You tell him about your meeting with Julien in Sumeru...}}
::'''Paimon:''' According to Julien, his ability to "paint everything exactly as he sees it" came from you. Did you really give him that power?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Is that really what he said? I can't decide if he was exaggerating...
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, so he was lying? But the painting he made for [[Pepper (NPC)|Pepper]] looked so real, even though the color was a bit off.
::'''Caterpillar:''' That was an ability he already had. What I did was to give him "certainty." The purer the person, the more obvious the effect of such support is.
::'''Paimon:''' Pure, huh... Well, he did look kind of gullible.
::{{DIcon}} And as for the [[Marvelous Bird Egg]]...
:::'''Caterpillar:''' They're good for your health when consumed in moderation.
::{{DIcon}} And the [[Delicious Tea Leaves|tea leaves]] that activate the imbiber's potential...
:::'''Caterpillar:''' He did spend a lot of Coupons to get them, yes...
::'''Caterpillar:''' I didn't know that he would break his "certainty" like that. I guess you could say that things turned out for the best, though.
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, both you and Lanoire are children, right? So, is your guardian here? Why are the two of you in a place like this...
:'''Lanoire:''' Cater's not a child.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Indeed, I am not. As for my present appearance... You can think of it as an illness of sorts.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. So that's how it is...
:'''Caterpillar:''' I've been here for a long time, well, because of what I've done in the past. But it's more complicated for Lanoire...
:'''Caterpillar:''' She was born here.
:'''Paimon:''' Here? In the Fortress?
:'''Lanoire:''' You're a strange one, Ms. Paimon. I've already told you that I've always been here, haven't I?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Agnes, her mother, was plagued by a chronic illness and passed away some time ago.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I don't stick my nose into other people's lives, so I didn't know about their situation. But regardless, Lanoire wound up with no one to care for her.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Maybe it's because I've been here for a long time, and Lanoire has taken to me, but either way, Estienne's asked me to look after her.
:'''Paimon:''' So that's how it is... But she shouldn't be here, right? It's not like she's done anything wrong...
:'''Caterpillar:''' You're right. I'm just looking after her for now, and she really should be with her family.
:'''Caterpillar:''' And fortunately, she does indeed have family outside the Fortress.
:'''Paimon:''' So that's what she meant when she said she has a home that she doesn't know about. Will she be able to reunite with them soon?
:'''Caterpillar:''' About that... Things are a little complicated, and I'm afraid it won't happen all that soon.
;(If An Artist Adrift has been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' How come?
;(If An Artist Adrift has not been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? Why?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Because she doesn't have any proof of identity. Maybe Agnes didn't think of that, either. She was the one who'd have needed to start the process to send Lanoire away from the Fortress.
:{{DIcon}} How about her other family members?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Estienne said that Agnes wrote them in the past, but that she never received a reply and thus stopped trying altogether. If they knew about the current situation, they might change their minds.
:'''Caterpillar:''' That's why I want to take her to her family. And if they don't want to take her in, we'll figure something else out then.
:'''Lanoire:''' Why can't I stay here? Sure, there's an evil sorcerer, but there's a good sorcerer, and you're here too! I don't want to leave.
:'''Lanoire:''' Mother never came back after leaving the Fortress.
:'''Lanoire:''' If I leave, does that mean that I'll never come back, just like my mother? And I'd never see you again either, Cater!
:'''Paimon:''' Agnes left?
:{{DIcon}} (I don't think Lanoire can comprehend what happened.)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah...
:'''Caterpillar:''' Either way, this is no place for a child to grow up. How will a sprout bloom without sunlight?
:'''Caterpillar:''' You should get out of this place, Lanoire. You've heard all the stories already. There's a real world outside and a family that you are connected to.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I'll go with you, so you needn't be afraid.
:'''Lanoire:''' I believe you. You've never lied to me.
:'''Paimon:''' But how will you get her out without proof of identity? Is there anything we can do to help?
:{{DIcon}} Is there some loophole or a backdoor we can use?
:'''Caterpillar:''' There are options, but they're too risky. How about this, then? Let's follow the rules... albeit not that strictly.
:'''Paimon:''' How will that work?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Every so often, Estienne will bring a few people with him to do some work outside. We use this chance to get Lanoire back to her family.
:'''Caterpillar:''' She doesn't have any proof of identification to begin with... and the disappearance of someone who never existed on paper isn't exactly going to make news here in the Fortress.
:'''Paimon:''' You aren't talking about "Coupon Millionaire," are you? Paimon remembers Estienne saying that whoever gets the most Coupons within a time limit will win the chance to go outside...
:{{DIcon}} Whoops. Our Coupons went straight to our stomachs.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! And Lanoire spent a ton more cleaning the Rag and Bone Shop out! We're sure to lose now! What are we gonna do?
:'''Lanoire:''' We won't lose. If Cater says we'll win, we'll definitely win.
:'''Paimon:''' Lanoire... Paimon suspects you aren't grasping the gravity of the situation at all!
:{{DIcon}} Can we get the Coupons refunded? We can just say that she's a child who didn't understand the rules...
::'''Caterpillar:''' As the transaction already took place, I'm afraid that won't be so easy.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, we'll just have to wait for the next opportunity...
:'''Caterpillar:''' It's fine. The Coupons I gave to Lanoire were for her to use as she pleased. This little mishap won't change the outcome.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon still feels kinda bad though. Why don't we help you? Paimon remembers Estienne saying that you can play the game as a group.
:'''Lanoire:''' Really, Ms. Paimon? You and {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} will play the game with us, too?
:{{DIcon}} Yep, and we'll win this thing together!
:{{DIcon}} We'll just consider this a commission with advance rewards.
:'''Paimon:''' With us here, this'll be a piece of cake! There are four of us, after all! Still, how can we get the most Coupons in the least amount of time...?
:'''Caterpillar:''' I already feel much better knowing that you'll be helping us. Thank you both. As for how to get the Coupons... I have a few ideas, but that can wait until tomorrow.
:'''Caterpillar:''' You must be exhausted. If you don't mind, why don't you rest up first? There's enough space here.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... good idea. {{Traveler}}, if you're tired, why don't we call it an early night?

::'''Noailles:''' ...What?
:{{DIcon}} What's everyone doing here?
:'''Noailles:''' If I'm not mistaken, you must be...{{Traveler}} and Paimon? I'll come back to your question in a moment.
:'''Noailles:''' I consulted the records from the last hundred years, and I couldn't find any record of a "Caterpillar." In light of this possible mislaying of documents, we'll need your cooperation to recreate them.
:'''Estienne:''' There's nothing pressing about the matter, if you ask me. What's the rush about?
:'''Noailles:''' Estienne, I often get the impression that you couldn't care less about restoring order to this place.
:'''Noailles:''' I can't agree with your viewpoint. People who habitually indulge their every whim just can't see that too much freedom actually does them harm.
:'''Noailles:''' I'll restore order to this chaos using my own methods. I'll advise you again not to stand in the way of my work.
:'''Estienne:''' "Chaos"? Isn't that just another word for "thinking on your feet"? *sigh* You know what? Forget it.
:'''Noailles:''' Is Caterpillar your real name? Additionally, I'll need you to state your crime in as much detail as possible &mdash; the time, location, as well as the final sentence pronounced.
:'''Noailles:''' The more details you provide, the greater the likelihood we'll have of retrieving your records. If your file was indeed lost, we can fill in a portion of your records based on your statement.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I've been called Caterpillar for as long as I can remember. I think this name suits me best, and it's the closest thing I have to a real name.
:'''Noailles:''' Real name... Caterpillar. Confirmed to be correct. Next, state your crime.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I carried out a certain task under my master's orders. I failed, but some people suffered because of it nonetheless. This was my crime.
:'''Noailles:''' Your master? I'll need their full name. Also, when did this occur?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Unlike me, he has many names. This happened a long time ago.
:'''Noailles:''' ...Are you messing with me?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Everything I've said is the truth.
:{{Black Screen|His voice sounds too low to be that of a child.<br>"I apologize. Were you looking for a more dramatic account? Or for some lurid details to ignite your imagination?"}}

:'''Noailles:''' There's nothing here for me to trouble myself with. Everything is as it should be...
:'''Estienne:''' Compared to the "temporarily" missing file, surely the misuse of the Rochelle Loudspeaker is a more obvious problem.
:'''Estienne:''' Apart from the unauthorized use, we've also received a number of complaints recently of nervous breakdowns caused by its repeated use...
:'''Noailles:''' You're right, Estienne. The guards have an even greater duty to put a stop to this sort of rule-breaking. We should investigate the matter immediately.
:'''Estienne:''' What are we waiting for, then? Let's get this show on the road.
:'''Paimon:''' (That's odd. Why did he flip at the drop of a hat?)
:{{DIcon}} (There's something fishy about this.)

;(Talk to Caterpillar)
:'''Caterpillar:''' Sorry for the delay. About the way I said I got the Coupons earlier...
:{{DIcon}} What did you do to him?
:'''Paimon:''' Someone that aggressive doesn't seem like the type to take advice from anyone. Why would he give up so easily...?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Just a few small tricks.
:'''Caterpillar:''' "The culprit is where he should be." This is an undeniable fact.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Making someone as straightforward as him "certain" of an undeniable fact isn't exactly hard.

:'''Caterpillar:''' I've been here for a long time, as you know. After staying in one place for a long time, it's only natural to pick up a few handy tricks to exert some degree of influence over your environment.
:{{DIcon}} Almost too handy, I'd say.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds a little suspicious...
:'''Paimon:''' Changing a stubborn person's mind with just a few simple phrases almost sounds like magic... Could there have been times when we were also influenced by magic without even knowing it?
:{{DIcon}} Considering how pure-hearted you are, Paimon, that is a worrying thought.

:;(If An Artist Adrift has not been completed)
:::'''Paimon:''' You too, {{Traveler}}! Wait a minute... You're not saying Paimon's gullible, are you?
:{{DIcon}} Would someone even realize that they're being influenced?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon was already a bit sleepy, but now her head is totally spinning...
:'''Caterpillar:''' It's not as simple as it looks &mdash; There are always limits to the application of tricks like these, and the results aren't always what you'd hoped for.
;(If An Artist Adrift has been completed)
::'''Caterpillar:''' It's like with Julien &mdash; He always had a knack for art, but he lacked confidence because of his visual impairment. The "certainty" that he could draw well was inside him to begin with.
::'''Caterpillar:''' But in other cases, the concept of "certainty" is just too abstract, making it difficult to predict the outcome.
::'''Caterpillar:''' So, I did take a chance this time. I just thought that if he held us up here, it would keep delaying the plan to get Lanoire out of the Fortress...
;(If An Artist Adrift has not been completed)
::'''Caterpillar:''' Once, there was an overly-trusting kid who wanted to progress in the arts. He always had a knack for it, but he lacked confidence because of his visual impairment.
::'''Caterpillar:''' The "certainty" that he could draw well was inside him to begin with. That's why I didn't turn him away when he came to me for help. Things didn't go quite as I expected in the end, of course, but...
::'''Caterpillar:''' I did take a chance this time. I just thought that if he held us up here, it would keep delaying the plan to get Lanoire out of the Fortress.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Besides, I doubt you wanted to be questioned by him repeatedly either.
:{{DIcon}} You shouldn't take chances like that.
:{{DIcon}} Well, you've got to take chances to achieve your goals.
:'''Caterpillar:''' You're absolutely right.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Back to the matter at hand... If you've changed your mind and want to back out, I understand completely. Lanoire might be sad for a time though. For her, playmates like you are hard to come by.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... We've already made a promise to her, so we can't just go back on our word now. Right?
:{{DIcon}} A promise is a promise.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah. Consider this our way of helping her out!
:{{DIcon}} This doesn't mean I trust you.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Of course. Knowing that our goals are aligned for the time being is enough.
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, where is she?
:'''Caterpillar:''' She went on an adventure early this morning &mdash; probably to rehearse for what's to come after she leaves this place. It's just as well, I have a few headaches to go take care of soon...
:'''Caterpillar:''' You can usually get a reward for helping others &mdash; including the guards &mdash; take care of some headaches.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, we totally get that. Sounds just like some of the Adventurers' Guild's commissions.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I see. Would you two join me on this next commission, then?
:'''Paimon:''' Sure! Where are we going?

:'''Paimon:''' Even Darcy's ahead of us! He entered the competition by himself, didn't he? How can this be happening...
:'''Caterpillar:''' Because he helped the guards take care of no small number of nuisances. For example, Ms. Monglane often asks him for help.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon sees... Wait a minute, does that mean he was so nice to us at the start because he could gain something from it...?
:'''Paimon:''' Also, won't we lose for sure if this keeps up? Urgh, if only Paimon hadn't eaten so much at the Rag and Bone Shop earlier...
:'''Caterpillar:''' No matter. All that counts is the total number of Coupons collected within the time limit. Using Coupons you already have doesn't affect the total count.
:'''Lanoire:''' That means you can eat even more, Ms. Paimon!
:'''Paimon:''' Lanoire... Our problem right now is that we're about to lose the competition! Aren't you guys the least bit worried?

::{{Black Screen|Thus, the little girl approached the garden wall and whispered to the woman that she was willing to bring the woman a few of the little purple flowers.

::'''Noailles:''' Well, children like you shouldn't even be here to begin with. If you end up leaving this place, I hope you don't come back.
::'''Paimon:''' ...Huh? O&mdash;Okay.
:'''Noailles:''' That's enough questions for today. It doesn't seem like you know very much, but if you do notice anything strange, make sure to report it at once. It's for your own good.
:{{Black Screen|Noailles leaves...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like we don't know much about Caterpillar after all... But if he doesn't want to talk about his crime or sentence or anything like that, Paimon thinks we'd better not press him.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not really concerned about any of that.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, he didn't ask much about our pasts either.
:{{DIcon}} He does seem a little suspicious...
::'''Paimon:''' Suspicious, huh... Well, he is kinda mysterious...
:'''Paimon:''' But whatever the case, he's doing a good deed right now, isn't he?
:'''Paimon:''' Lanoire seems to really trust him as well... So he's probably not a bad guy... at least for now, right?
:{{DIcon}} You can never go wrong with a little caution.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah.
:{{Black Screen|After you wait patiently for a little while, Caterpillar and Lanoire return.}}
:'''Lanoire:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon! You're both so fast! I got carried away talking to Ms. Galvana.
:'''Lanoire:''' She even gave me some candy! She said they're made from [[Ajilenakh Nut|a fruit that grows on the trees in a desert oasis]]...
:'''Lanoire:''' I asked her what kind of place a desert oasis might be, and she said it's a little body of water surrounded by a vast sea of sand.
:'''Lanoire:''' Doesn't that sound just like the Fortress? Except... Y'know, opposite, since this place is surrounded by water.
:'''Paimon:''' Once you leave this place, maybe you'll get to go there and see it for yourself! That reminds me, after all the hard work we've done, we must have advanced by now, right?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Speaking of that, I asked Estienne, and here's where things stand at the moment...
::'''Estienne's "Coupon Millionaire" Game''' &mdash; Third Tally
::"Dirty Face" Darcy's Team: 1,350
::Genevieve and Poiret's Team: 3,100
::Rave's Team: 3,150
::Kids Team: 2,230<!-- I got 2,260 here. -->
:'''Paimon:''' You mean we basically haven't advanced at all!? How could that be?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like the competition's been hard at work, too.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Indeed. Rave has some contacts, and the researcher and detective's assistant will have their own ways.
:'''Paimon:''' Surely this isn't the time to be singing our rivals' praises? Is there really nothing we can do? We're definitely gonna lose at this rate...
:'''Lanoire:''' We're gonna lose? But if we lose, we can all stay here in the Fortress, right?
:'''Caterpillar:''' We've talked about this before, Lanoire. If we stay here, we'll have to worry each day about being taken away by evil sorcerers.
:'''Lanoire:''' Oh... then I guess it would be better to leave. But... But Ms. Paimon said we're definitely gonna lose...
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;We're not gonna lose! The game's not over yet, there's still enough time. We're gonna win this!
:{{DIcon}} If we don't win this time, there's always next time.
::'''Paimon:''' Don't be such a wet blanket, {{Traveler}}! Have some faith. We can definitely win this time!
:{{DIcon}} An underdog victory would be more exciting.
::'''Paimon:''' The fact of the matter is, there are only two teams ahead of us. We've got nothing to worry about!
:'''Caterpillar:''' There isn't much time left until the deadline Estienne set. Let's just meet at the message board in the administrative area next time.
:'''Paimon:''' Ohh, there isn't much time left until the final results are announced, is there... Paimon has a feeling she's gonna toss and turn in bed tonight...
:'''Lanoire:''' You can tell me in secret if you feel scared, Ms. Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, seriously? A kid like you, worried about Paimon...? Paimon won't get scared! You're the one who should be scared! Paimon hopes you'll have sweet dreams, Lanoire!
:'''Lanoire:''' Don't worry, I've had lots of nice ones. In fact, I wish I could give some to the two of you!

;(Talk to Caterpillar and Lanoire, optional)
:'''Lanoire:''' The candy Ms. Galvana gave me... is so sweet.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Remember to brush your teeth before bed.
:'''Lanoire:''' Okay... I will!

;(Rest at the bunk bed)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Should we rest now?
:{{DIcon}} Let's rest for a bit.
::{{Black Screen|"It's my turn to tell a story! I've heard enough stories to tell one of my own now."<br>"Alright, you can be the storyteller this time."<br>"Okay. My story will also begin in the giant's garden..."}}
::{{Black Screen|Long, long ago, in a garden full of purple flowers, there lived a prince, a princess, and a brave hero... Oh! And the ruler of the garden &mdash; a giant with a nasty temper.<br>What the witch wanted more than anything were some of the purple flowers, but the mean giant treasured them so much that he wouldn't let anyone pick even a single one.<br>"Kind-hearted Mr. Giant," the witch asked, "I am in need of the little purple flowers from your garden. You have so many already, could you please share just one with me?"<br>But the mean giant refused. "Every flower in my garden belongs to me," the giant shouted, "I won't share them with anyone!"}}
::{{Black Screen|"Kind-hearted Mr. Giant," the witch continued, "please hear my tale. I traveled here from a fountain in a far-off, distant land. An Oceanid there has fallen ill, and the scent of those purple flowers brings her comfort. If you could give me just one of them, perhaps her condition will improve..."<br>But the giant, who didn't have an ounce of compassion in his heart, callously refused the witch's request. What did an Oceanid in a faraway land have to do with him?}}
::{{Black Screen|"Then," the witch asked, "is there anything I can do for you? I know many magic spells, and I could use my magic to help you with someone in exchange. Will you agree to my request, kind-hearted Mr. Giant?"<br>The giant thought it over, then said that he had lost something very important to him. If the witch could use her magic to help him find it...}}
::{{Black Screen|"So, they made a deal?"<br>"Yep! In the end, the witch's friend recovered and the giant found what he had lost. Isn't that a better story? At least in this story, everyone gets a happy ending..."}}
:{{DIcon}} There's something else I want to ask about.
:;(Exits dialogue)
----
;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' The game will be over soon. We have to turn this around today. In addition to taking commissions...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders if there are ways to get tons of Coupons in one go.

;(Interact with the blackboard)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Caterpillar probably went to get Coupons elsewhere, but he left us some clues...)
:{{DIcon}} The south side of the dormitory block.<small>(If [[Scenes from Life in Meropide: Chit-Chat]] has not been completed)</small>
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Maybe we'll even be able to get some Coupons...)
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Looks like Caterpillar left us a few Coupon breadcrumbs to follow...)
:{{DIcon}} The southeast side of the production zone's upper level.<small>(If [[Scenes from Life in Meropide: Unfinished Task]] has not been completed)</small>
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Maybe we'll even be able to get some Coupons...)
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Looks like Caterpillar left us a few Coupon breadcrumbs to follow...)
:{{DIcon}} We'll take our chances.
----
;(Obtain 300 coupons)
:'''Paimon:''' Caterpillar said to meet at the message board in the administrative area. Paimon wonders if they're there already. Let's go take a look, shall we?

;(Approach Rave, Genevieve, and Estienne at the bulletin board)
:'''Paimon:''' Strange, Caterpillar and Lanoire aren't here yet.
:'''Rave:''' Why bother coming when you know you're going to lose?
:{{DIcon}} I wouldn't be so certain of that.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! You're only ahead of us by a little...
:'''Rave:''' A little? Haha.
:'''Rave:''' Can the results be announced now, Estienne? Actually, no... Let's wait a little. After all, the best must be saved for last.
:'''Estienne:''' Looks like we don't have to wait long. Here they come.
:'''Lanoire:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}! Ms. Paimon! Have you seen the results yet? Did we win?
:'''Paimon:''' We don't know yet...
:'''Rave:''' Well, seems everyone's here. Would you announce the results now, Estienne?
:'''Estienne:''' Of course. Oh, but the results on Caterpillar's end still need to be calculated...
:'''Rave:''' My, my, what a cruel guard, toying with us from start to finish like that.
:'''Rave:''' Why don't you wring out the last bit of mercy in your heart and let them know that the gap between us is too wide to cross? Stop torturing us with false hope.
::'''Estienne's "Coupon Millionaire" Game''' &mdash; Fourth Tally

::Genevieve and Poiret's Team
::Rave's Team

:'''Estienne:''' These aren't the final results, but...

::"Dirty Face" Darcy's Team: 1,650
::Genevieve and Poiret's Team
::Rave's Team
::Kids Team
:'''Lanoire:''' We should be able to win once we add the Coupons that Cater got today, right?
::'''Estienne's "Coupon Millionaire" Game''' &mdash; Fourth Tally
::"Dirty Face" Darcy's Team: 1,650
::Genevieve and Poiret's Team: 0
::Rave's Team
::Kids Team
:'''Paimon:''' Hold on, why have Genevieve's team's points been cleared out?
:'''Genevieve:''' I was against it. But this is the more logical approach with respect to the results.
::'''Estienne's "Coupon Millionaire" Game''' &mdash; Fourth Tally
::"Dirty Face" Darcy's Team: 1,650
::Genevieve and Poiret's Team: 0
::Rave's Team: 8,250
::Kids Team
:'''Paimon:''' What's that supposed to mean...? Whoa, Rave's team has so many points!
::'''Estienne's "Coupon Millionaire" Game''' &mdash; Fourth Tally
::"Dirty Face" Darcy's Team: 1,650
::Genevieve and Poiret's Team: 0
::Rave's Team: 8,250
::Kids Team: 2,790
:'''Genevieve:''' He doesn't need the chance to leave, and we don't need to place first.
:'''Paimon:''' You mean you gave all your Coupons to Rave? Isn't that against the rules?
:'''Genevieve:''' There's no rule forbidding it. I was originally in favor of amending the rules to ensure fair play, but no one else seemed to be in support of that.
:'''Estienne:''' Indeed, there isn't a rule forbidding that. *sigh* This competition would have been far more exciting if everyone could have fully used the rules to their advantage.
:'''Rave:''' More exciting for you, maybe. Rules don't mean a thing in a game as boring as this one. At the end of the day, it's a question of upholding one's honor.
:'''Rave:''' Alright, now that the scores have been announced, isn't it time for the final results?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Our points from today haven't been added yet.
:'''Rave:''' Hmph... A drop in the ocean.
::'''Estienne's "Coupon Millionaire" Game''' &mdash; Fourth Tally
::"Dirty Face" Darcy's Team: 1,650
::Genevieve and Poiret's Team: 0
::Rave's Team: 8,250
::Kids Team: 2,003,480
:'''Estienne:''' Now that everything's been added, here's what the results look like.
:'''Lanoire:''' Yes! {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, look! Look! We won!
:'''Rave:''' What...? That's impossible! What did you do?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... that many? Paimon's lost count... Hmm...
:'''Caterpillar:''' It's a trick even simpler than magic.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I used the Coupons I'd saved up in the past to hire a bunch of people to help me work. What we have now is the product of their work this whole time. And I believe this falls within the rules, too.
:'''Genevieve:''' Even if it does, that's an insane amount...
:'''Caterpillar:''' I also have my reasons for needing to win, and I'd even gotten help from my two friends. It would be a real shame if we lost now.
:{{DIcon}} So this wasn't about honor?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Vanity, perhaps.
:{{DIcon}} I think it's time to announce the final results.
:'''Estienne:''' Since everything's been tallied, it's time to announce the final results. The winners of this game are Caterpillar, {{sic|{{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}}<!--missing space-->{{Traveler}}}}, and Ms. Paimon.
:'''Estienne:''' No objections, I take it?
:'''Genevieve:''' There's nothing I can say, except that it looks like I picked a fight with the wrong opponent. I ended up in here last time for striking someone in anger. I won't make the same mistake this time.
:'''Rave:''' ...You'll pay the price for the choices you made.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, Paimon didn't expect to hear someone actually say that.
:{{DIcon}} Pretty cliche, if you ask me.
:{{DIcon}} "We'll see about that! You'll seeee!"
::'''Paimon:''' That's even more cliche!
:'''Estienne:''' Is everyone ready? If so, let's set off now.
:'''Estienne:''' Let's do this before Noailles gets back. I hope he can understand that his thinking isn't wrong, but that it's just not suited for a place like this.
:'''Caterpillar:''' You're ready, aren't you, Lanoire?
:'''Lanoire:''' Uh-huh! I've already said goodbye to everyone.
:{{DIcon}} We're also ready to get going whenever.
:'''Estienne:''' Alright. Just keep quiet for a while. I've made some arrangements in advance, so we shouldn't run into any problems.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Additional Dialogue===
After starting the quest, [[Monglane]] or [[Galvana]] will chastise the player after performing certain actions.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If the player is spotted by the searchlights outside the Fortress)
:;(The player is teleported to the Administrative Area)
:'''Monglane:''' You better behave, if you don't want to be sent to the confinement room to reflect on what you did.

;(If the player enters or attempts to leave the Fortress via the Dormitory Block pipeline before completing ''[[Scenes from Life in Meropide: Dead End]]'')
:'''Galvana:''' You two again? Please... just behave if you want to get out soon.
