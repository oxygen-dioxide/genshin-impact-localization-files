|- id="Decarabian's Tower"
|[[Decarabian's Tower]], [[Stormterror's Lair]]
|Located in the middle of Stormterror's Lair and is first scaled as part of the Archon Quest [[Empty Abode]]. As its name implies, it was where the God of Storms once resided and overlooked his people.

|- id="Entrance to Stormterror's Lair"
|[[Entrance to Stormterror's Lair]], [[Brightcrown Canyon]]
|The entrance to Stormterror's Lair is a notable set of ruins built in the [[Decarabian's Mondstadt#Architecture and Design|Decarabian style]] that leads directly into [[Decarabian]]'s capital city. Soldiers used to be stationed along the road in Brightcrown Canyon leading into the city.<ref name="TTG1">{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|1}}</ref> In-game, the road leading out of the city leads to the boar habitat to the south; whether there were other parts of the road that have since been lost is a mystery.

|- id="Boar Habitat"
|[[Boar Habitat]], [[Brightcrown Canyon]]
|Following the path out of the entrance to Stormterror's Lair, marked by the worn dirt and crumbled pillars in the Decarabian style, eventually leads to a field naturally enclosed by ridges. This area is notable for its unusually high number of [[Forest Boar]]s.<br />At the center of the field is a wooden {{w|bell-cot}}. Its architectural style does not match that of the ruins in the area and instead uses a roofing style seen on houses in [[Springvale]], which are built in the traditional [[Classic Country Home]] style. However, without further details, it is impossible to discern when this structure was built and for what purpose.
