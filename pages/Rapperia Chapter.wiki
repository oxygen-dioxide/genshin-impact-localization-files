===Act I - Silent Night===
{{Main|Silent Night}}
{{Description|As the lights in the opera house dim, the curtain falls upon the trial onstage... [[Clorinde]] resheathes her sword.<br>The private life of the one known as [[Fontaine]]'s "strongest" [[Champion Duelist]] has always been an enigma to most. None dare to ask, much less to probe too deeply...<br>Some claim to have seen her silhouette in the shadows of dark alleys, and others say she hunts phantoms in the woods in her spare time, and still others speak of her often privately patronizing a certain "Tabletop Troupe" club...<br>One can only wonder, just where will the "strongest" Champion Duelist be found today...?}}
