After the player lands 3 successive counterattacks on the Sternshield Crab and depletes its shield, it will be instantly defeated. However, if the player fails to launch successive counterattacks, the Sternshield Crab will remove its shield.

|desc_4      = While not shielded, every time the it is hit by the counterattack of the hold version of the Xenochromatic Armored Crab's ability, it will lose '''20%''' of its Max [[HP]].

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A crab that makes its home in borrowed shells.<br>Armored Crabs are constantly searching for shells that fit their bodies as they grow. A storybook that told the tale of the trials of an Armored Crab searching for a suitable shell was extremely popular in Fontaine for a time. Though the story is filled with childlike wonder, the reaction after proved that, like many fairytales, it touched adults even more deeply.|[[Archive]]}}
