'''Forging''' is a [[Crafting Method]] where Players can use [[Forging Ores]] to forge [[Weapon Enhancement Materials]], which are used to level up [[Weapons]]. Players can also use [[Northlander Billets]] and Forging Ores to forge 4-Star Weapons.

In addition to the required materials, forging an item also takes a certain amount of time and [[Mora]] to start the process. If a player forges multiple items, the forge time and required Mora will stack. (i.e. Forging 10 Enhancement Ores will take 30 seconds and cost 50 Mora).

The game treats all blacksmith locations in-game ([[Wagner]] in Mondstadt, [[Master Zhang]] in Liyue, [[Hajime]] in Inazuma, any [[Open-Air Workshop]] placed in the [[Housing|Serenitea Pot]], etc.) as the same forge. Items may be forged in one location then picked up at another.

==Forge Queues==

As players increase their [[Adventure Rank]] they will automatically unlock additional Forge Queues which allow you to craft multiple items at the same time. It is possible to split the workload of the same item crafted multiple times into the 4 queues to speed up overall crafting time by running queues in parallel.

There are a total of 4 Forge Queues. The first is unlocked when you start the game, the second at Adventure Rank 5, the third at Adventure Rank 10, and the fourth and final queue is unlocked at Adventure Rank 15.

There is an invisible daily limit of 300,000 Weapon EXP worth of Enhancement Ore that can be forged, shared between Normal, Fine, and Mystic Enhancement ores. For example, this limit can be reached by forging 30 Mystic Enhancement Ores, or by some combination of the 3 (e.g. a combination of 75 normal, 60 Fine, and 15 Mystic). This limit doesn't apply when crafting the Mystic Enhancement Ore recipe that uses Magical Crystal Chunks and Original Resin.

Attempting to forge more after reaching this daily limit will display the message "Unable to forge <Ore> today." even if all queues are empty.

==Mining Outcrop Search==

Upon reaching [[Reputation]] Level 2 in any city, recipes that involve [[Magical Crystal Chunk]]s and the ability to ask Blacksmiths and several NPCs daily for locations of daily respawning mining outcrops are unlocked. For a list of NPCs that can be asked daily for mining outcrop locations, see [[Mining Outcrops#Mining Outcrop Search|Mining Outcrops]].
