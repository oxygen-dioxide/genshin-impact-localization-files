{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Izem:''' Today's coffee... is the same as yesterday's.
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Izem:''' It's not bad. Or as what the people here might say, it's pretty good.
::'''Izem:''' Everyone loves peace and quiet. Although I'm not really used to it, there's nothing to complain about.
::'''Izem:''' Drinking coffee every day, lazing about, passing each day slowly... I feel like my days are longer than when I was in the Corps of Thirty.
::'''Izem:''' The acting manager makes me the same coffee every day, and says I should be as used to peace as the nearby residents are.
::'''Izem:''' A day like that will probably come in the future.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} It's actually a good thing to retire.
:::'''Izem:''' Yeah, I've come to realize that lately.
:::'''Izem:''' Maybe it's time to say goodbye to my old chaotic lifestyle.
::;(Obtain [[Old Merc's Pal]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Izem:''' Yes. Farewell, my previous life.
