==Lore==
"Oh, come on! Everyone got this just for you!"<br />
[[Barbara]] happily passed a wonderfully wrapped gift box to Rosaria, even as the latter looked on with a mix of suspicion and annoyance.

Tearing the packaging open, she found a note on the box cover across which elegant script flowed like music.<br />
"Dear Sister Rosaria, we have asked Ms. Barbara to send this gift to you, but please, do open it somewhere where she can't see you."

Opening the box with her back turned, Rosaria discovered that the box contained still another note. It was thusly written in the same hand as before:<br />
"Dear Sister Rosaria, we know that you don't appreciate having too many people know your birthday. However, this piece of information was written on your resume by {{sic|Grandmaster}} [[Varka]], so, on this important day, do allow the [[Church of Favonius]] to send you a new uniform, made just for you."<br />
"If you're alright with it, stop being so aloof and be a normal Sister for once."

Deacon Dahlia (This letter was written at the request of Sister [[Victoria]])
