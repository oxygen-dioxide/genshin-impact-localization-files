'''To the Church's Free Spirit''' is [[Rosaria]]'s Alternate [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Rosaria wears a form-fitting nun's habit consisting of a long black coif with red lining, a black undershirt with a white chest, long white gloves, and a long black and red slit skirt that partially reveals her right leg and completely reveals her left. She wears black belts around her left thigh, along with black shorts, black tights, and black high-heeled boots.

Rosaria's outfit is adorned with multiple silver and white gold accessories embedded with red gems; including a silver tiara on top of her coif, a silver pendant on her white top, a white gold brooch on her left shoulder and left hip, multiple silver claw rings on her fingers and a small silver censer tied to her right wrist with a long piece of black cloth. Her Cryo Vision hangs off of her waist on her lower back.

==Description==
"Oh, come on! Everyone got this just for you!"<br>
[[Barbara]] happily passed a wonderfully wrapped gift box to Rosaria, even as the latter looked on with a mix of suspicion and annoyance.

Tearing the packaging open, she found a note on the box cover across which elegant script flowed like music.<br>
"Dear Sister Rosaria, we have asked Ms. Barbara to send this gift to you, but please, do open it somewhere where she can't see you."

Opening the box with her back turned, Rosaria discovered that the box contained still another note. It was thusly written in the same hand as before:<br>
"Dear Sister Rosaria, we know that you don't appreciate having too many people know your birthday. However, this piece of information was written on your resume by {{sic|Grandmaster}} [[Varka]], so, on this important day, do allow the [[Church of Favonius]] to send you a new uniform, made just for you."<br>
"If you're alright with it, stop being so aloof and be a normal Sister for once."

Deacon [[Dahlia]] (This letter was written at the request of Sister [[Victoria]])

==Trivia==
* In Chinese, Rosaria's third Outfit Switch Voice-Over may be a reference to Micah 7:19 in the Christian {{w|Bible}}.
** The Chinese Union Version (CUV) of the verse reads: {{Lang|mini=1|zh=必再怜悯我们、将我们的罪孽踏在脚下、又将我们的一切罪投于深海。}}<ref>Chinese Wikisource: [[wikisource:zh:聖經 (和合本)/彌迦書|{{Lang|mini=1|zh=彌迦書 (和合本)}}]]</ref> The {{Lang|mini=1|zh=将(...)踏在脚下}} phrasing is repeated in Rosaria's line, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=<u>将</u>昨日<u>踏在脚下</u>吧。}}, or "<u>Let us  tread</u> yesterday <u>underfoot</u>."
** In the American Standard Version (ASV) of the Bible, the verse reads: "He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea."<ref>Wikisource: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Micah|Micah (ASV)]]</ref>
