'''Weight''' is the [[measurement]] of the force of [[gravity]] on an entity (character or enemy). It is an attribute that affects [[Interruption Resistance]] and how entities are pulled by [[Vacuum Field]]s.

For example, the heavier the entity, the harder it is for them to be [[displacement|displaced]] in general.

==Physical Definition==
In classical Newtonian physics, weight is defined as
:<math>w = mg</math>
where m is the [[mass]] of the object and g is the acceleration of gravity. The unit of measurement for weight is the Newton (<math>kg \cdot m/s^2</math>), which is also used to measure force.
