'''Tatarigami Investigation Expedition''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Yashiori Island]], [[Inazuma]].

The Lost Texts document an ill-fated expedition by a group of [[Kujou Clan|Kujou Samurai]] of the [[Tenryou Commission]] to investigate the [[Tatarigami]] disturbance on Yashiori Island. The Lost Texts recount the group gradually succumbing to Tatarigami influence. The entire group is presumed dead or missing.

===Fort Fujitou===
:'''Lost Text:''' "The front line troops on Yashiori Island have been badly traumatized, much to the concern of the [[Kujou Takayuki|Clan Head]]..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...[[Kujou Masahito|Lord Masahito]] once sent a letter describing the chaos caused by the 'Tatarigami.' However, the Clan Head's response was one of fury rather than of sympathy."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...As a result, we were sent to inspect the situation on the island, report the truth, and encourage Lord Masahito to pull himself together and crush that hive of rebel scum..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...Otherwise, the Clan Head might consider demoting Lord Masahito from his post as General and assigning [[Kujou Sara|Lady Sara]] instead."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...We've landed on the island, and will continue south and camp along where the Jakotsu is. We will play it by ear from there."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...There seem to be pirates not far south of Fort Mumei. We will arrange for a search later..."

===Musoujin Gorge===
:'''Lost Text:''' "...From here, we can see all of Nazuchi Beach. There are several pirate hideouts... The shipwreck in the distance is very suspicious. It's an ideal place for harboring stolen goods, deserters, bandits, robbers, or for setting up an ambush..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...I sent Suzuno to inspect it but nothing was found. It seems that someone used to live in this shipwreck... The pirates are wandering around like a pack of wild hounds. This is no place to tarry..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "Next, we will make our way southwestward. Soon, we'll camp in sight of the Serpent's Head... If we encounter any deserters, we shall execute them right away..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...My nose has been bleeding since noon and I'm feeling dizzy and weak. What an insult to the reputation of the Kujou Samurai..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...Kanemoto reported that he saw a kid on the island... Perhaps we should capture him and have him show us the way..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...I had a nightmare. In that dream, the small island in the western sea was submerged by quicksand. That is an evil sign..."

===Serpent's Head===
:'''Lost Text:''' ...My head hurts badly, especially at night. I feel like my head is going to explode. Some of our team members started to cough blood and have nightmares every night...
:'''Lost Text:''' ...I've developed a rash on my skin, and my chest feels itchy and damp inside... We must report to the Clan Head that this [[Tatarigami]] is no mere rumor...
:'''Lost Text:''' ...The skull of the great serpent god is staring at me ferociously. Its wretched spirit still holds hatred towards the victors' people. I must leave here as soon as possible, or the consequences will be hard to imagine...
:'''Lost Text:''' ...We will turn north and go to Higi Village...
:'''Lost Text:''' ...From the cliff of [[Higi Village]], we may be able to observe the pirates' activities at sea to our northwest...
:'''Lost Text:''' ...I must remember the Clan Head's spoken instructions: We've got no time to lose. If we see refugees and sick people, we must have no mercy. Lure them to the pier and sink their boat halfway. If anyone should ask, we must tell them that it was done by the rebels. We must not let the Tatarigami disrupt the Shogun's rule no matter what...

===Higi Village===
:'''Lost Text:''' "...A light shines from an island to our west... Maybe it's the smugglers' stolen booty..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "The situation in Higi Village goes most ill. Gongozaemon is the best swordsman among us and was still in fairly good shape..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...So he was dispatched to confront the village chief about whether he's hidden any deserters... So far, he hasn't returned... Yamada was sent to issue a warning..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...If he fails to return in another half an hour, we will regard the village as having assisted traitors, and they shall be executed immediately..."
:'''Lost Text:''' ...Many villagers came out, but not the village chief. Something doesn't seem right..."
:'''Lost Text:''' (The text stops here.)

===Fort Mumei===
:'''Lost Text:''' "...One tooth, two teeth, three teeth... Something black oozed out of them..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...The black waves... The treasure is here... Itchy. It's so itchy..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...Kanemoto lost the bet... Suzuno's sword is still here... I still have some food..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...My skull feels itchy... No, I don't want my ears to grow inside my head. I don't want to listen to 'his' voice..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...My apologies, Clan Head... The treasure is mine..."
:'''Lost Text:''' "...I am melting into 'his' whisperings..."

==Trivia==
*Gongozaemon and Yamada's fates are detailed in the World Quest ''[[Sinister Instruction]]''. Both of them were slain by [[Washizu]], the village chief, as sacrifices for "Him."
**Washizu estimates Gongozaemon's age at 30 years old, and states that Yamada was 23 years old.
