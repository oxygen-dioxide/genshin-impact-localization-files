;Other Additions
* New [[Book]]s:

* Adds Set 30 of "[[Paimon's Paintings]]" chat emojis.
* New "[[Training Guide]]" function:
*# The "Training Guide" will provide character building recommendations for "Character Level," "Weapon," "Artifacts," and "Character Talents" based on the data of recently active players as well as the maximum World Level unlocked. Additionally, for Travelers who have not yet unlocked World Level 6, when they fail a challenge (e.g.: open world battles where all party members fall in battle, Domains, Trounce Domains, and other challenges and domains where players are defeated), the game interface will display tips according to the current data of the party's characters. Travelers can follow the prompts and head to the "Training Guide" to view suggestions for building characters to boost their adventure prowess.
*# Function Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 12 or above and complete the World Quest "Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild."

;Spiral Abyss
* Floor 11 Ley Line Disorder changed to:
** All party members receive a 75% Geo DMG Bonus.
* Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 4.5, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:
** Phase I: Sundered Moon
*** When characters create Geo Constructs, unleash a shockwave at the character's location, dealing True DMG to nearby opponents. 1 such shockwave can be unleashed every 6s.
** Phase II: Gravel Moon
*** When a character deals Geo DMG to an opponent, this instance will be counted for the character. 1 count can be gained every 0.1s. When the count reaches 3, this character will receive a Gravel Mark, granting them 50% Geo DMG Bonus for 10s.
** Phase III: Arrowgale Moon
*** After a character triggers a Swirl reaction, all party members' Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 20% for 10s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Max 3 stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently.

==Adjustments & Optimizations==

* The filter search bar in "[[Inventory]] > [[Furnishing]]s" as well as "[[Creation]] / Furnishings" in the [[Serenitea Pot]] now support adding spaces.

;Genius Invokation TCG

;Other
* Optimizes drop rules for [[Local Legend]] opponents.
* [[Passive Talent]] text descriptions that were previously written as "Increases the Movement SPD of your own party members by..." have been unified as: "Your party members gain the Swift Stride effect: Movement SPD increased by..." (Actual effect has not changed)

* Adds the function to skip dialogue that has been completed in [[Hangout Event]]s.

* The effect ""When played: Generate 1 Die of the same Element as the attached character. If you have 3 different Elemental Types in your party, generate 1 Omni Element in addition to this."" will be adjusted to ""When played: Generate 1 Die of the same Element as the attached character. If you have 3 different Elemental Types in your party, generate 2 such Dice instead.""
* Adds a new effect for Support Card "[[Jade Chamber (Support Card)|Jade Chamber]]": When Action Phase begins: If you have no more than 3 cards in your Hand, discard this card and create 1 Omni Die.
* Adjusts the Elemental Dice cost for the Event Card "[[Knights of Favonius Library]]": The Elemental Dice cost required will be adjusted from 1 to 0.
