|description    = An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br>These pure white kitty cats are named and famed for their shining sapphire-blue eyes. But no matter how lovely Sapphires may be, they also have terrible tempers. One must take care to have some fish jerky &mdash; and some balm for superficial cuts &mdash; handy when hanging out with them. But somehow, in ways unknown to anyone, the soft-hearted [[Tubby]] managed to command their obedience and respect.
