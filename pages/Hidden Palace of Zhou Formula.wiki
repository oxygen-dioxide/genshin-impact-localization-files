|description  = There is a [[Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method|secret ritual]] that can conceal one gate out of eight, cutting off the route for evil to escape. This ritual was performed here long ago, sealing demons within this labyrinth. Rumor has it that the Method to fit Pillars with Zhou Formula presently seals an evil [[Chi]].

==Trivia==
* According to Issue 2 of the [[Teyvat Times]], Domain of Blessing: Frost II<ref group="Note">Frost was the name of the Domains of Blessing until it was renamed to Roaring Fire in 4.8.</ref> is the domain that travelers have been most likely to fail in both [[Co-Op Mode]] and Single Player.
* The Achievement to unlock this Domain is also called ''[[Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula (Achievement)|Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula]]''.
* This is one of two regular domain entrances that does not have a [[Solomon's knot]] above it, the other being [[Cecilia Garden]].

===Etymology===
*{{Lang|"{{w|Guicang}}"|zh=归藏|zh_tl=Return to the Hidden}}, {{Lang|"{{w|zh:連山易|Lianshan}}"|zh=连山}}, and {{Lang|"{{w|Zhou Yi}}"|zh=周易|zh_tl=Changes of Zhou}} were three independent ancient Chinese arts of divination collectively known as the {{Lang|"Three Changes"|zh=三易|zh_rm=Sānyì}}. These names are the basis for the three "Hidden Palace of [Name] Formula" domains: [[Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula]], [[Hidden Palace of Lianshan Formula]], and Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula.
* This is the only Hidden Palace domain whose English name does not reflect its Chinese name, as the Chinese name changed between the [[Beta|Closed Beta Tests]] and the game's global release while the original English name was retained.
** The Chinese name translates along the lines of "Hidden Palace that Takes Responsibility for Wuwang," referring to the formulas used to seal away the serpent at Wuwang Hill.
