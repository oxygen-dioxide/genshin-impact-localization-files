==Trivia==
* This is the only Hidden Palace Formula Domain whose English name does not reflect its Chinese name, as the Chinese name changed between the [[Beta|Closed Beta Tests]] and the game's global release while the original English name was retained.
** The Chinese name translates along the lines of "Hidden Palace that Takes Responsibility for Wuwang," referring to the formulas used to seal away the serpent at Wuwang Hill.
** The Zhou Formula refers to the ancient Chinese art of divination {{Lang|"{{w|I Ching|Zhou Yi}}"|zh=周易}}, one of the {{Lang|"Three Changes"|zh=三易|zh_rm=Sānyì}}. The other two are {{Lang|"Guicang"|zh=归藏}} and {{Lang|"Lian Shan"|zh=连山}}, correlating to the other two [[Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula|Hidden Palace]] [[Hidden Palace of Lianshan Formula|Formula Domains]].
* According to Issue 2 of the [[Teyvat Times]], Domain of Blessing: Frost II is the domain that travelers have been most likely to fail in both [[Co-Op Mode]] and Single Player.
* The Achievement to unlock this Domain is also called ''[[Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula (Achievement)|Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula]]''.
* This is one of two regular domain entrances that does not have a [[Solomon's knot]] above it, the other being [[Cecilia Garden]].
* The level names of this domain are all "Frost" which likely refers to how the Ley Line Disorder gives benefits if you use certain Cryo reactions.
