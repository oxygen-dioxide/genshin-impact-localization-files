==Trivia==
* According to Issue 2 of the [[Teyvat Times]], Domain of Blessing: Frost II is the domain that travelers have been most likely to fail in both [[Co-Op Mode]] and Single Player.
* The Achievement to unlock this Domain is also called ''[[Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula (Achievement)|Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula]]''.
* This is one of two regular domain entrances that does not have a [[Solomon's knot]] above it, the other being [[Cecilia Garden]].
* The level names of this domain are all "Frost," referring to the Cryo-favoring Ley Line Disorder.

===Etymology===
*{{Lang|"{{w|Guicang}}"|zh=归藏|zh_tl=Return to the Hidden}}, {{Lang|"{{w|zh:連山易|Lianshan}}"|zh=连山}}, and {{Lang|"{{w|Zhou Yi}}"|zh=周易|zh_tl=Changes of Zhou}} were three independent ancient Chinese arts of divination collectively known as the {{Lang|"Three Changes"|zh=三易|zh_rm=Sānyì}}. These names are the basis for the three "Hidden Palace of [Name] Formula" domains: [[Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula]], [[Hidden Palace of Lianshan Formula]], and Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula.
* This is the only Hidden Palace domain whose English name does not reflect its Chinese name, as the Chinese name changed between the [[Beta|Closed Beta Tests]] and the game's global release while the original English name was retained.
** The Chinese name translates along the lines of "Hidden Palace that Takes Responsibility for Wuwang," referring to the formulas used to seal away the serpent at Wuwang Hill.
