===Requirements===
*[[Adventure Rank]] 21 or above

===Summary===
*During the event, Travelers can take part in challenges all over [[Golden Apple Archipelago|the islands]]. Defeat the enemies within the time limit and earn points. By reaching the target scores, Travelers can obtain rewards such as [[Primogem]]s, [[Talent Level-Up Materials]], [[Hero's Wit]], and [[Mora]].
* Starting on the first day of the event, a new challenge will unlock each day until the seventh day, by which all the challenges will have been unlocked. The seven stages will be distributed at different locations throughout the islands.
* Travelers can select the difficulty level before the challenge begins, and the amount of points you obtain for completing the challenge is based on the difficulty selected. They will obtain rewards at various score levels based on the highest score they achieve in a stage.
* Each challenge stage has unique mechanics that will provide basic buffs.
