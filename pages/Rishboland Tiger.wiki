{{Description|A beast that resides in the woods. The king of the jungle.<br />It regards the entire woodland realm as its territory, and will often survey its domain even as a true king might. Any intruder shall be set upon with extreme prejudice. It has almost exaggeratedly amount of fluff {{sic}} on its temple, and research indicates that this allows it to measure distances.<br />It is said that the forests once played host to a true tiger, a divine beast that defended the woods. Upon its death, these creatures that resemble cats far more became the successors to its mighty name.|[[Archive]]}}
'''Rishboland Tiger''' is a [[Wildlife]].

Wild Rishboland Tigers are extremely territorial. They patrol mountains on a daily basis and will assault any invaders.

Meanwhile, they take care to maintain their appearance. They often wash their faces to clean up their hair. Word has it that when they are not hunting, they &mdash; similar to many other beasts &mdash; are fond of playing games, such as chasing their own tails.
