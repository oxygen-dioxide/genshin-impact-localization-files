'''Seelie''' (plural Seelie<!-- or Seelies-->) are the devolved form of '''Angels'''<ref name="Beneath the Secret Source">{{Ref/Quest|page=Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref> that can be found throughout [[Teyvat]]. Each Seelie belongs to its respective Seelie Court, a statue the Seelie seem to finally rest at. Electro Seelie will instead "generate" their own court once they reach their destination.

Seelie can often be found around treasure, puzzles, or locations of interest. Seelie and Seelie Courts can be out in the open or hidden behind breakable objects, such as the large rock formations with cracks in them. [[Chest]]s will appear once the Seelie has settled back into the court. The player can activate their [[Elemental Sight]] near an empty Seelie Court and a blue trail will lead in the direction that the Seelie currently is and vice versa. Seelie will return to their starting location if they have not been led back to their court after a certain amount of time.

==Other Types==
===Warming Seelie===
[[File:Tutorial Adventure Warming Seelie.png|200px|thumb|right]]
In [[Dragonspine]], a unique type of Seelie have evolved to survive the harsh colds.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Warming Bottle}}</ref> These Seelie are different to the average Seelie, having a red appearance resembling flames. They produce enough heat to keep nearby travelers warm and insulated from [[Sheer Cold]].

Additionally, once settled in their Seelie Courts, the Warming Seelie will continue to produce heat.

The [[Warming Bottle]] that players can craft were made to imitate the heat that Warming Seelie produce, to better help adventurers survive in cold climates.

===Electro Seelie===
[[File:Electro Seelie.png|200px|thumb|right]]
In [[Inazuma]], Electro Seelie are a variant that moves at a high speed when the player moves close to them. Upon approaching it, it will unleash an Electro shockwave that applies a non-volatile Electro element to nearby players and enemies. This Electro application does not deal DMG and is incapable of causing [[Elemental Reactions]].

Electro Seelie may also appear as part of other puzzles. These Electro Seelie do not wait for player proximity, come to rest in a Seelie Court, or lead directly to chests as usual. Instead, they fly in a path to help the player solve a puzzle, such as indicating the order in which to light up [[Elemental Monument]]s. They may appear when a mechanism is activated and disappear at the end of their path, or they may persist and only disappear when the puzzle is completed.

===Luminous Seelie===

In the unique climate of the [[The Chasm/Underground Mines|Underground Mines]] of [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]], Seelie have mutated to Luminous Seelie. Being close to a Luminous Seelie will gradually recharge the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]]'s energy. They can also activate [[Lumentorch]]es when nearby.

===Seelie of Life===
[[File:Seelie of Life.png|200px|thumb|right]]
Seelie of Life (''unofficial name'') appear in [[Withering Zones]] and have the same effects as [[Candles of Life]]. They will remove units of Decay when in close proximity.

===Mini Seelie===
{{Main|Mini Seelie}}
[[File:Item Mini Seelie Dayflower.png|200px|thumb|right]]
Mini Seelie appear to be infant versions of the Seelie. They only have the "head" part of an adult Seelie and do not possess the pointed lower body, the flowing "scarf," or the two trailing whiskers. They also lack the typical chime-like sounds associated with the presence of an adult Seelie, instead occasionally bursting out with very excited squeaky noises.

A notable one is a [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]], which actively searches for treasures (namely [[Lost Riches|Iron Coins]]) instead of going back to their Court. [[Ulman]] formerly had one who aided him but unfortunately stopped responding to him, and he instead lent it to the Traveler (whom the Mini Seelie was rather fond of).

By attaining enough Silver Coins, one of the variations of Mini Seelie can be exchanged. Unlike the Treasure Seeking Seelie, these Seelie have an idle animation and make noises.

===Monetoo===
{{Main|Monetoo}}
[[File:Monetoo.png|200px|thumb|right]]
Although not a type of Seelie per se, Monetoo are a Natlanese equivalent of Seelie, functioning practically the same as Mysterious Seelie. Their main difference is that their resting place is an incomplete mural instead of a Seelie court. Just like Seelie, a Monetoo's location can be approximated by using Elemental Sight next to its mural.

==Achievements==
{{See Also|Monetoo}}
{{Achievement Topic Table|topic=Seelie}}

==Time-Limited Seelie==
*3 additional Seelie are available during the {{Quest|The Illumiscreen: II}}. These 3 Seelie count towards the ''[[Lithic Guide]]'' achievement.
*14 Seelie are available during the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]] event. These Seelie '''do not''' count towards the ''[[Phosphoros' Guidance]]'' achievement.

==Trivia==
* Seelie resemble {{w|will-o'-the-wisp}}s from classic folklore. They also resemble {{w|sea angel}}s in terms of appearance.
* The Seelie Courts in [[Enkanomiya]], [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]], [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]], the [[Great Red Sand]], the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]], and the [[Girdle of the Sands]] are still intact &mdash; not broken or ruined &mdash; unlike most Seelie Courts in [[Teyvat]].
* When Seelie settle in a damaged court, the court will be repaired. However, this sometimes will not occur. It is unknown whether or not this behavior is intended.
** This is also the case when the player returns to a court that had repaired itself upon a Seelie's arrival, which will appear broken again upon return.
* There is currently a bug in-game that will incorrectly count progress towards the ''[[Guiding Wind]]'' and ''[[Lithic Guide]]'' achievements sets, where the game may miss a Seelie that has already been followed back to their court or may count some additional times.
* The following [[loading screen]] tips relate to the Seelie:
** "Now you see them; now you don't. Once a mighty race that lived to guide mankind, now the most Seelie offer is a little treasure to willing followers."
** "Seelie all want to return to their Seelie Courts. If you see the remains of a small statue like this, you can use Elemental Sight to find traces of the Seelie..."
** "Dragonspine's unique climate has caused even the Seelie to mutate. The gentle warmth of a Warming Seelie can help alleviate the effects of the bitter cold. Perhaps its warmth can also be used to trigger mechanisms..."
** "The Chasm's unique climate has caused even the Seelie to mutate. Being close to a Luminous Seelie will gradually recharge the Lumenstone Adjuvant's energy. The light from such a Seelie can also activate some devices."

===Etymology===
*The Seelie and their statues are named after the {{w|Classifications of fairies#Seelie and Unseelie Courts|Seelie Courts}} of Scottish Folklore. They are described as fairies who seek help from humans and would return kindness favors of their own. The behavior of the Seelie in Genshin Impact (rewarding with treasures if they are followed back to their statues) alludes to this folklore.
