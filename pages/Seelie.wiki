'''Seelie''' (both singular and plural) are mysterious beings throughout [[Teyvat]]. Each Seelie (except Electro ones) belongs to its respective Seelie Court, a statue the Seelie seem to finally rest at. Electro Seelie will instead "generate" their own court once they reached their destination.

Seelie can often be found around treasure, puzzles, or locations of interest. Seelie and Seelie Courts can be out in the open or hidden behind breakable objects, such as the large rock formations with cracks in them. Treasure chests will appear once the Seelie has settled back into the court. The player can activate their [[Elemental Sight]] near an empty Seelie Court and a blue trail will lead in the direction that the Seelie currently is and vice versa. Seelie will return to their starting location after a certain amount of time.

==History==
{{Description|"The chirping of insects on a long-gone autumn night is the chorus of exiles, singing mankind's most ancient song as they live out their plight..."<br />"Stripped of all that the body once held close and the soul once held dear, song, and memories are all that now remain of yesteryear."<br />"The last singers, the first Seelie, they played their final tune in the halls of angels."|Part of "a song of Seelie"<ref name="ADT">{{Ref/Book|A Drunkard's Tale}}</ref>
}}
According to legend, Seelie are the remnants of a bygone race that once held beautiful forms and immense wisdom and used it to guide mankind.<ref name="RoJ4">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|4|Mountain Spirit}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Loading|Seelie}}</ref> They had palaces outside the realm the gods currently hold authority over,<ref name="ADT" /> which may be referring to [[Celestia]] or, more likely, the [[Dark Sea]].

The ancestor of the Seelie once met a traveler from afar, with whom they married. Their marriage was witnessed by the [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon|three sisters]] of the Lunar Palace &mdash; Aria, Sonnet, and Canon. Thirty days after the union, a [[Cataclysm|disaster]] struck; the Seelie and their lover fled into exile, but the disaster eventually caught up with them. As punishment, they were separated, and their memories were wiped.<ref name="RoJ4" />

Their previous form, voice, and wisdom are now lost, and now all they will offer is small treasures to those willing to follow them.

==Other Types==
===Warming Seelie===
[[File:Tutorial Adventure Warming Seelie.png|200px|thumb|right]]
In [[Dragonspine]], a unique type of Seelie have evolved to survive the harsh colds.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Warming Bottle}}</ref> These Seelie are different to the average Seelie, having a red appearance resembling flames. They produce enough heat to keep nearby travelers warm and insulated from [[Sheer Cold]].

Additionally, once settled in their Seelie Courts, the Warming Seelie will continue to produce heat.

The [[Warming Bottle]] that players can craft were made to imitate the heat that Warming Seelie produce, to better help adventurers survive in cold climates.

===Electro Seelie===
[[File:Electro Seelie.png|200px|thumb|right]]
In [[Inazuma]], Electro Seelie are a variant that moves at a high speed when the player moves close to them. Upon approaching it, it will unleash an Electro shockwave that applies a non-volatile Electro element to nearby players and enemies. This Electro application does not deal DMG and is incapable of causing [[Elemental Reactions]].

Electro Seelie may also appear as part of other puzzles. These Electro Seelie do not wait for player proximity, come to rest in a Seelie Court, or lead directly to chests as usual. Instead, they fly in a path to help the player solve a puzzle, such as indicating the order in which to light up [[Elemental Monument]]s. They may appear when a mechanism is activated and disappear at the end of their path, or they may persist and only disappear when the puzzle is completed.

===Luminous Seelie===
[[File:Luminous Seelie.png|200px|thumb|right]]
In the unique climate of the [[The Chasm/Underground Mines|Underground Mines]] of [[The Chasm]], Seelie have mutated to Luminous Seelie. Being close to a Luminous Seelie will gradually recharge the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]]'s energy. They can also activate [[Lumentorch]]es when nearby.
{{clr}}

===Mini Seelie===
[[File:Item Mini Seelie Dayflower.png|200px|thumb|right]]
Mini Seelie appear to be infant versions of the Seelie. They only have the "head" part of an adult Seelie and do not possess the pointed lower body, the flowing "scarf," or the two trailing whiskers. They also lack the typical chime-like sounds associated with the presence of an adult Seelie, instead occasionally bursting out with very excited squeaky noises.

A notable one is a [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]], which actively searches for treasures (namely [[Lost Riches|Iron Coins]]) instead of going back to their Court. [[Ulman]] formerly had one who aided him but unfortunately stopped responding to him, and he instead lent it to the Traveler (whom the Mini Seelie was rather fond of).

By attaining enough Silver Coins, one of the 4 variations of Mini Seelie can be exchanged: [[Mini Seelie: Ros√©]], [[Mini Seelie: Dayflower]], [[Mini Seelie: Curcuma]], or a [[Mini Seelie: Viola]]. Unlike the Treasure Seeking Seelie, these 4 Seelie have an idle animation and make noises.

==Time-Limited Seelie==
* 3 additional Seelie are available during the [[The Illumiscreen: II]] event World Quest. These 3 Seelie count towards the [[Lithic Guide]] achievement.
* 14 Seelie are available during the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]] event. These Seelie '''do not''' count towards the [[Phosphoros' Guidance]].

==Trivia==
* They resemble a {{w|will-o'-the-wisp}} from classic folklore. They also resemble the real-life sea creatures called ''{{w|clione}}'' in terms of appearance.
* The Seelie Courts (the statues) in [[Teyvat]] and [[Enkanomiya]] have the same appearance, but the ones in Enkanomiya are more intact compared to those in Teyvat.
* There is currently a bug in-game that will incorrectly count progress towards the "[[Guiding Wind]]" and "[[Lithic Guide]]" [[achievements]], where the game may miss a Seelie that has already been followed back to their court or may count some additional times.
* These [[Loading Screen|loading screen]] tips relate to the Seelie:
** "Now you see them; now you don't. Once a mighty race that lived to guide mankind, now the most Seelie offer is a little treasure to willing followers."
** "Seelie all want to return to their Seelie Courts. If you see the remains of a small statue like this, you can use Elemental Sight to find traces of the Seelie..."
** "Dragonspine's unique climate has caused even the Seelie to mutate. The gentle warmth of a Warming Seelie can help alleviate the effects of the bitter cold. Perhaps its warmth can also be used to trigger mechanisms..."
** "The Chasm's unique climate has caused even the Seelie to mutate. Being close to a Luminous Seelie will gradually recharge the Lumenstone Adjuvant's energy. The light from such a Seelie can also activate some devices."

===Etymology===
* The Seelie and their statues are named after the {{w|Classifications of fairies#Seelie and Unseelie Courts|Seelie Courts}} of Scottish Folklore. They are described as fairies who seek help from humans and would return kindness favors of their own. The behavior of the Seelie in Genshin Impact (rewarding with treasures if they are followed back to their statues) alludes to this folklore.
