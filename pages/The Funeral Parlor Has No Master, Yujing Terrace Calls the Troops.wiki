:{{A|vo eqhdj402 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what brings you here?
:'''Gaming:''' I gotta make a delivery to [[Chenyu Vale]]. It works out nicely, 'cause my [[Yip Tak|dad]]'s eager for me to get home for the holidays anyway. So, two birds with one stone.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on! A delivery from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor to Chenyu Vale? ...Is this for the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]], by any chance?
:'''Gaming:''' ...Wait, what? Have you been learning fortune-telling, or something? How could you know that?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no. We just ran into [[Xingqiu]] a couple days ago, so he told us the news...
:'''Gaming:''' Whew, you scared me there for a second! I thought we'd sprung a leak, and on the one job that we were specifically told has to be extremely hush-hush... But it sounds like you found out from another source, so we're all good.
:'''Gaming:''' Miss Undertaker, is everything ready to be loaded up? If so, I'll do a quick inventory count and then we'll be on our way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 2 ferrylady 03.ogg}} '''Ferrylady:''' The goods are ready for inspection. This way, please.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, Gaming... the last we heard, [[Baizhu]] was still trying to figure out a way to help Xingqiu's great-grandfather. So... did it not work, then?
:'''Gaming:''' Oh. The Baizhu part is news to me... but anyway, the master from the Feiyun Commerce Guild said they just wanna ship some items back home to get ahead of the situation.
:'''Gaming:''' I guess they're hoping for the best and planning for the worst. So don't worry, there's still hope.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, gotcha. Hey, {{Traveler}}, do you think we should go see Xingqiu?
:'''Gaming:''' Uh, before you run off on a wild goose chase... Master Xingqiu's already back home in Chenyu Vale. He and his brother made the trip together &mdash; something about checking if any repairs are needed at the family home.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... That doesn't sound promising...
:{{DIcon}} Let's check in with Baizhu.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! He's sure to know what's going on.
:'''Gaming:''' Alright, well I'd better get moving. Next time, we're going for dim sum!
:;(The Traveler and Paimon start heading to Bubu Pharmacy and run into Baizhu, who is crossing the bridge from the direction of the [[Adventurers' Guild]].)
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Baizhu! What are the chances? We were just about to go looking for you.
:'''Changsheng:''' A most curious coincidence. He was searching for you, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I was indeed. {{Traveler}}, there's a situation I need your help with.
:{{DIcon}} Has His Lordship taken a turn for the worse?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' No, his condition is stable for now. This is a different situation... it's about Qiqi.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Qiqi? What's wrong with her? Has she passed out, too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' She still hasn't come back from her herb-gathering trip. It was two days ago that she left, and she was supposed to return the same day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... um, maybe all the mountain-climbing slowed her down? Or maybe she got bored of work, and turned it into a vacation...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Given Qiqi's unique condition, we always make sure to write the agreed return time in her notebook.
:'''Changsheng:''' There is also a rule in the notebook which says "Not finding herbs &mdash; OK. Getting home late &mdash; not OK." But she's now over a day late, and still, no sign of herbs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes... Has this ever happened before?
:'''Changsheng:''' Never, hence our concern that something has happened to her. So, we posted a commission at the Adventurers' Guild yesterday.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 05.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' But I've dealt with many adventurers in the past, and they don't always fill me with confidence, so I'm not comfortable leaving the search for Qiqi to them alone.
:'''Changsheng:''' Neither am I. Just this morning, some of the adventurers were back already, saying they found the place where Qiqi went missing, but got spooked because it was haunted. Needless to say, they did not catch a glimpse of Qiqi herself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 06.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' In short, right now, you are the only person I feel I can trust completely.
:{{DIcon}} Where did you send her to go herb-gathering?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 07.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Wuwang Hill, in the Qingce mountain range.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Qingce again, huh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 08.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Indeed... It's looking increasingly likely that something untoward has happened up there.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 09.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I saw two new patients yesterday. Their symptoms were identical to those present in [[Timaeus]] and His Lordship.
:{{DIcon}} We can discuss that later. Right now, we should go.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, finding Qiqi is the number-one priority right now. We'll update you as soon as we can.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 baizhu 10.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Thank you both. I'm counting on you.

;(Approach the marked location at Wuwang Hill)
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or is this place creepier than ever? ...Paimon really hopes Qiqi's okay...

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look! It's another one of Lan Yan's rattan figures... Does that mean she's been here?
:{{DIcon}} Probably. And likely with Hu Tao.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just what are they up to...? Oh, Paimon's got it! They came here to go [[ghost]]-hunting!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The people from the Adventurers' Guild did say Wuwang Hill was haunted. Hu Tao knows all about ghosts, and Lan Yan's rattan figures have all those witness sigils on them, so she must know what she's doing too!
:{{DIcon}} Then... what happened to Qiqi?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm... One second, hmm... Okay, hear Paimon out. Qiqi's a [[zombie]], so her joints are stiff. That means she can't run too fast, and so... she must have gotten kidnapped by a ghost!
:{{DIcon}} A perfectly logical argument. But somehow, still not very credible.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, alright then, well let's keep looking for clues. We'll see who's right soon enough!
:;(They begin to search for clues and hear rustling)
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What was that sound?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eek! Ghost incoming!
:'''Yelan:''' Hold up. It's me.
:{{Introductory Note|Yelan}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Yelan!? What are you doing here? We were told this place was haunted... Well, guess it kind of was. Just not by ghosts, apparently...
:'''Yelan:''' Hehe, that's right. I managed to scare off a few rookie adventurers, but it looks like you're not so easy to spook. Anyway, don't go any further &mdash; there's danger up ahead.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... we have to find Qiqi! She went missing around here, and she could be in danger.
:'''Yelan:''' I'm aware of the situation. My contacts in the Adventurers' Guild filled me in.
:'''Yelan:''' I found an herb-gatherer's basket part way up the mountain, possibly belonging to Qiqi. But I don't think she's here anymore.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What makes you so sure?
:'''Yelan:''' Because I scoured this whole place looking for clues. That's how I know that the immediate area is safe &mdash; but beyond this point, I can't be sure.
:{{DIcon}} So you're here to look for Qiqi as well?
:'''Yelan:''' No. I'm investigating the unknown disturbance here.
:'''Yelan:''' About a month ago, the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] noticed an unusual spike in the number of elderly people seeking medical care in [[Qingce Village]]. Plus, they all seemed to be suffering from an unknown illness.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Baizhu noticed that too! He's convinced that something's up in Qingce Village.
:'''Yelan:''' Actually, we discovered that the source of the problem isn't Qingce Village itself, but where we are now &mdash; Wuwang Hill.
:'''Yelan:''' But the village isn't far from here, and the elderly residents are particularly vulnerable, which is why they've borne the brunt of it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. The plot thickens.
:{{DIcon}} I'll bet Hu Tao and Lan Yan knew something.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Probably. If only we knew where the heck they've gone...
:'''Yelan:''' I... might have some idea.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really!? So where are they?
:'''Yelan:''' Somewhere difficult to reach. For now, you should come with me &mdash; we need to speak with Ningguang.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What? Why?
:'''Yelan:''' Don't act so surprised. I just shared top-secret information with you... Surely you didn't think I would let you walk away?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? Wh&mdash;What are you gonna do!?
:'''Yelan:''' I'm kidding. Ningguang is well aware of the situation with Director Hu, and everything I've seen suggests that Lan Yan and Qiqi have ended up in the same place as her.
:'''Yelan:''' Come on. Ningguang will explain everything.
----
;(Approach [[Yiyan Temple]])
:'''Beidou:''' In the past, I would've said "No way"...
:'''Beidou:''' I mean, I'd be happy to join you, but I'm not about to tell my crew they won't get to go home for the festival this year.
:{{Introductory Note|Beidou}}
:'''Ningguang:''' That all goes without saying... unlike what I hope you're going to say next.
:{{Introductory Note|Ningguang}}
:'''Beidou:''' Haha! You sure have a way with words... alright, fine! It's a yes!
:'''Beidou:''' The Gate of Fright, [[Guyun Stone Forest]], yeah? I'll handle it.
:'''Ningguang:''' I knew I could count on the great Captain Beidou to answer the call of duty.
:'''Beidou:''' Save the compliments &mdash; just make sure you pay my crew properly. It's Lantern Rite, so they'll be expecting fives times their usual rate.
:'''Ningguang:''' Hah, the deal is sealed and then the trap is sprung... Well, you've got me now. So what about your share, hmm? How much will that rob me of?
:'''Beidou:''' Oh, please. Firstly, no one can rob the Tianquan &mdash; not even me. And secondly... Keep my share, it's my gift to you. Go buy yourself a new hairpin with it.
:'''Beidou:''' Saves me a trip to the market, right? Hahaha.
:'''Beidou:''' Oh, hey! {{Traveler}} and Paimon!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahoy there, Captain Beidou!
:'''Beidou:''' Ah, little Paimon. That bright-eyed enthusiasm is exactly what Ningguang needs... She's conscripting you, by the way. Got some real back-breaking work lined up for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...What?
:'''Beidou:''' Haha, sorry, I gotta dash. See ya 'round, folks!
:'''Beidou:''' ...Oh yeah, and Happy Lantern Rite.
:'''Ningguang:''' Yelan clearly knows me well. She's brought you two here without me needing to say a word.
:{{DIcon}} Beidou said you were... conscripting us?
:'''Ningguang:''' Beidou never passes on an opportunity to wisecrack at my expense.
:'''Yelan:''' She's not exactly wrong though, is she? {{Traveler}} and Paimon have actually been there before. That makes them the perfect candidates.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Been where? Where's "there"?
:'''Ningguang:''' I know you're looking for someone, and I don't wish to waste your time. So, I'll get right to the point.
:'''Ningguang:''' From what I understand, Director Hu Tao, Miss Qiqi, and Ms. Lan Yan are currently stranded inside... the border.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Border... THE border? That border!?
:'''Yelan:''' Yes, that border. The border between life and death.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, whoa, whoa. When did you find out about the border? Wait, and how did you know we'd been there before?
:'''Yelan:''' Heh. Come on.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right... literally your job to know that kind of stuff... Fair enough. Good job.
:{{DIcon}} How are you so sure they're at the border?
:'''Ningguang:''' Time is limited, so I can't go into full detail, but let me give you a brief bit of background on the current situation.
:'''Ningguang:''' One month ago, the Ministry of Civil Affairs became aware of an unusual illness affecting the elderly of Qingce.
:'''Ningguang:''' A couple of weeks later, Director Hu came to report a potential disturbance in the border. The Ministry of Civil Affairs investigated, and sure enough, found an ominous presence on Wuwang Hill.
:'''Ningguang:''' Then, three days ago, Hu Tao came to us again, this time to update us that she was now ready to go to the border and investigate the situation in full.
:'''Ningguang:''' We had agreed to meet again yesterday, but she failed to show up. That's when I sent Yelan to investigate further.
:'''Yelan:''' Director Hu's last-known location was Wuwang Hill. Same goes for Qiqi and Lan Yan. I'm about ninety percent sure all three of them are stuck in the border.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If even Hu Tao can't get out, there must be something seriously wrong...
:'''Ningguang:''' Now that you know the situation, are you willing to travel to the border and rescue Hu Tao and company? Your prior experience exploring that realm makes you our best hope.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course! If our friends are in trouble, we'll help however we can!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But there's one problem. Last time we went to the border, Hu Tao led the way. We don't know how to get there on our own.
:{{DIcon}} I'm guessing Ningguang already thought of that?
:'''Ningguang:''' You can seek assistance from the Conqueror of Demons at Wangshu Inn. He will show you the way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Xiao! Of course.
:'''Ningguang:''' Heh, Yelan was preparing to travel to the border herself before you two entered the picture. So naturally, he has been briefed on the situation.
:{{DIcon}} Understood. We will head out right away.
:'''Ningguang:''' This rescue mission is of the utmost importance. Director Hu must be brought back safe and sound.
:{{DIcon}} Consider it done.
:'''Ningguang:''' Then I'll wait here for the good news.
:;(The Traveler and Paimon leave)
:'''Yelan:''' We got lucky. If I'd gone, I don't know what my chances would have been.
:'''Ningguang:''' Mm, but don't go putting your feet up just yet, Yelan... I'm afraid I have another mission for you.
:'''Yelan:''' ...Yeah, I figured that might be the case. What's the situation?
:'''Ningguang:''' The gate array. We've now found the locations of the gates of Life, Concealment, Fright, and Injury.
:'''Yelan:''' Is that right?
:'''Ningguang:''' [[Keqing]] and [[Ganyu]] are handling the gates of Life and Concealment, and Captain Beidou has agreed to take the [[Crux Fleet]] to guard the Gate of Fright.
:'''Ningguang:''' That leaves the Gate of Injury. I've racked my brains, and other than the Conqueror of Demons, I can't think of anyone more suitable for this one than you.
:'''Yelan:''' Hmm? Oh...
:'''Yelan:''' ...I see. It's in [[The Chasm]].
:'''Ningguang:''' That's right. As for the remaining four gates, we are working to calculate their positions based on what we know of the array so far. It shouldn't take long now.
:'''Ningguang:''' When I last saw Director Hu, she said that if worse comes to worst, activating the Seven-and-Eight-Gates Array may be our only option.
:'''Yelan:''' ...
:'''Ningguang:''' ...But if you have doubts, I would like to hear them.
:'''Yelan:''' I don't know much about this magic array. But doesn't it involve obfuscating one of the people involved?
:'''Ningguang:''' ...
:'''Ningguang:''' *sigh* That is what troubles me, too... Let's continue this discussion another time.

;(Talk to Ningguang, optional)
:'''Ningguang:''' You have an update for me already?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj402 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... no, we were just about to head off actually!

;(Approach Xiao in Wangshu Inn)
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiao! You're already here.
:'''Xiao:''' ...It's you two? Where's Yelan?
:{{DIcon}} There's been a change of plan.
:'''Xiao:''' Do you have any idea how dangerous this mission is?
:{{Introductory Note|Xiao}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll be fine. Danger's never stopped {{Traveler}} before, has it?
:'''Xiao:''' The border between life and death is a treacherous place at the best of times, and the recent disturbances will only make it more so. You will face great peril at every step of the way.
:{{DIcon}} There are people stranded there. We have to get them back.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly. Plus, we made a promise to Ningguang.
:'''Xiao:''' ...Please, go back and tell them to send Yelan instead.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? Are we not good enough?
:'''Xiao:''' I would feel more comfortable sending Yelan. She is privy to a secret art practiced by her clan, plus, she has extensive experience in battle. If anything was to happen to {{Traveler}}...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, so you're just worried for {{MC|m=his|f=her}} safety. Wait, but {{MC|he|she}} has extensive experience in battle too!
:'''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, think of something!
:{{DIcon}} We... promised [[Zhongli]] we would go.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What do you...
:{{DIcon}} (Show Xiao the Rex Coin from Zhongli)
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Oh! Yeah, so um... This is a protective talisman that Zhongli gave us. It's even got the symbol of [[Rex Lapis]] on it &mdash; see?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He said we'd better get Hu Tao back safe and sound, or there'll be consequences!
:'''Xiao:''' Your attempts to mislead me are futile. That coin is clearly a counterfeit &mdash; it carries only the symbol of Rex Lapis, and none of his power.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Uh, drat! Zhongli swindled us, hehe... heh...
:{{DIcon}} What's worrying you, Xiao?
:'''Xiao:''' I fear the bad karma I carry would only disturb the border further. So, while I can show you to the entrance... I cannot venture inside with you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's what this is about. You're worried that you won't be able to rescue us if something bad happens, huh? Paimon can understand, but still...
:{{DIcon}} I'm not the one you should be worried about.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! Hu Tao understands the border better than anyone. Without her, no one has a clue how to handle this situation.
:{{DIcon}} Plus, we've been there before.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup! That makes us the second most experienced border-goers after Hu Tao!
:{{DIcon}} Dare to trust us.
:'''Xiao:''' *sigh*...
:'''Xiao:''' Very well. Then, hold tight.
----<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! That was fast!
:'''Xiao:''' The border should be nearby.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...So, do you know the spell to open the border?
:'''Xiao:''' No. Balancing the forces of life and death has always been the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's domain. I am not familiar with their craft.
:'''Xiao:''' But since the border has been disrupted, fetor is leaking out. We simply need to find where the leak is &mdash; that will be your entrance.
:'''Xiao:''' Evil Conquering!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 8 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was amazing... So you can see fetor?
:'''Xiao:''' With my [[adeptus]] perception, I can sense the presence of the abnormal. Whether it's fetor or not, we shall see soon enough. Let's go.

:'''Xiao:''' This is the place.

:'''Xiao:''' As I said earlier, this is as far as I can accompany you, or I risk doing more harm than good. You'll be on your own from here.

:'''Xiao:''' Hmm... Lean your head in for a second.
:'''Xiao:''' Kavirudhaka! Huh!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What did you do?
:'''Xiao:''' I placed a Witness Sigil on your forehead so you can share my powers of perception. Now you'll be able to see the fetor. There's no knowing what things are like in there, but hopefully this will help.
:'''Xiao:''' When you find them, call my name. I will open a passage and pull you out.

:'''Qiqi:''' Want to... close my eyes... and dream...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 lanyan 03.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Fight it, Qiqi, fight it!
:'''Hu Tao:''' A dream, huh? Alright, Qiqi, lemme help you with that. Now listen closely, this is how your dream is going to go:
:'''Hu Tao:''' Picking herbs in the blazing sun, Qiqi wipes her brow.
:'''Qiqi:''' Picking herbs... Qiqi...
:'''Hu Tao:''' She finds a temple on a hill, and goes to seek the Dao.
:'''Qiqi:''' Temple... on a hill...
:'''Hu Tao:''' An old priest greets her at the door &mdash; surprise! Her name's Hu Tao!
:'''Qiqi:''' H&mdash;Hu Tao?
:'''Hu Tao:''' She grabs young Qiqi with both hands... and buries her deep underground! By Rex Lapis, she'll never be found!
:'''Qiqi:''' No! Don't bury me! Help...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Not so sleepy now, are you?
:'''Qiqi:''' No, wide awake with fright...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 lanyan 04.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 lanyan 05.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Drat... Hu Tao, we've got a problem. Somehow, they've broken through my illusion!
:'''Hu Tao:''' The monsters, you mean?
:'''Qiqi:''' Monsters...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 lanyan 06.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Don't be afraid, Qiqi. We'll protect you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hu Tao! Madame Lan, Qiqi! Oh, thank goodness we finally found you!
:'''Hu Tao:''' What the...? Oh, so it was you guys!
:'''Qiqi:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 lanyan 07.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' You frightened me for a second &mdash; I thought my illusion had been undone by a bunch of monsters... How did you find this place?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Let me guess, the Tianquan sent you? I knew she'd act if I missed our meeting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, so Hu Tao really planned ahead! She knew someone would come after her.
:{{DIcon}} It's dangerous here. Time to get out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 lanyan 08.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' It's not as simple as that. This place is changing constantly. Director Hu has found the exit plenty of times, but it would always close before we can get to it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, don't worry, we've got you covered!

:'''Xiao:''' I'm glad you made it out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 12 lanyan 01.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Excuse me, Sir, but are you the legendary Conqueror of Demons?
:'''Xiao:''' You may spare the formalities. Is everyone okay?
:'''Hu Tao:''' We're alright, but Qiqi absorbed a little too much fetor.
:{{DIcon}} Start from the beginning. What exactly happened?
:'''Qiqi:''' I was picking herbs. Then I saw a hole.
:'''Qiqi:''' I tried to block the hole...
:'''Qiqi:''' But instead, I fell in.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 12 lanyan 02.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' There's clearly something special about Qiqi. If I'd absorbed that much fetor, I don't think I'd still be around to tell the tale...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Qiqi's condition is certainly... unique. But regardless, it was still a risky call.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well then, let's get her to [[Bubu Pharmacy]], shall we?
:'''Xiao:''' I'll take her. Your work is still not done, so you should return to Yujing Terrace.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, true. We shouldn't keep Ningguang waiting any longer. She's probably as stressed as a [[slime]] in a hot spring by this point, right?
:{{DIcon}} ...I highly doubt it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, well, we can discuss that later &mdash; let's just head back.
----
;(Approach Ningguang at Yujing Terrace)
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ningguang, Ningguang! We got everyone back safely!
:'''Ningguang:''' Impressive work, {{Traveler}}. You were even quicker than I expected.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thought you'd be super anxious, having to wait for us here at Yujing Terrace. But you seem as calm as ever...
:{{DIcon}} See? And you thought she'd be hopping around like a slime.
:'''Ningguang:''' Hehe, if I can't trust you, then I really don't know who I can turn to.
:'''Hu Tao:''' My apologies, Lady Tianquan! I promise I'm not usually late for appointments, let alone by a whole day... Hope you can understand!
:'''Ningguang:''' No apology necessary, Director Hu. It was my mistake letting you go to the border by yourself.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Don't say that! Even I didn't think the situation would get this bad.
:{{DIcon}} How bad is "this bad"?
:'''Ningguang:''' I'd like to know, too. How dangerous is the situation we face? And how does it compare to previous cases?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Way worse. Like waaaaaay, way worse!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 lanyan 01.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Huh? So this isn't the first time? I've never heard of this happening before...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Well, don't forget, the border isn't part of the natural landscape. It's more like an old house that's gradually falling apart.
:'''Hu Tao:''' So it requires maintenance every once in a while &mdash; sometimes every few centuries, sometimes every other decade or so. And of course, that is the responsibility of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
:'''Hu Tao:''' In the past, though, the worst it got was a few small fetor leaks. That's an easy fix with our secret art &mdash; it burns it all away no problem. But this time is different... Inside the border, it's like the whole world has been turned upside down...
:'''Ningguang:''' Do you have any idea what the cause might be?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Not so far, no.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it's the [[Abyss]]?
:'''Hu Tao:''' I doubt it. I haven't found any traces of Abyssal activity.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're thinking about [[Natlan]], right? It did feel kind of similar... But not exactly the same.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is Liyue's border anything like the [[Night Kingdom]] in Natlan?
:'''Ningguang:''' Ah yes, I've heard a little about [[Incandescent Ode of Resurrection|the crisis]] there. But as far as I understand, the Night Kingdom is a true realm of the dead, while the border is more of a boundary world between life and death.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Yep. It's a demarcation line: life on side, death on the other. So if the border fails, souls will pour out, and the whole thing becomes a chaotic mix of life and death. Just like what happened all those millennia ago.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder so many people have been aging faster than normal...
:'''Hu Tao:''' It's a symptom of death encroaching on the world of the living.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 lanyan 02.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Then, what should we do now?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Burning away the fetor won't do any good, because the issue is the border itself. Lady Tianquan, any progress on the Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method I mentioned last time?
:'''Ningguang:''' Yes. We've deduced the locations of four of the gates, and we should be able to pinpoint the rest of the array before long.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Whoa, already? The Tianquan doesn't mess around!
:'''Ningguang:''' Several strokes of luck were involved. Our nation is blessed with good fortune.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second! That gates method you mentioned... are you talking about the one from the Sanctification of [[Tao Dou]]!?
:'''Hu Tao:''' That's the one. You've seen the state of the border. I can't think of any other way to fix it besides a complete do-over.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do-over? You mean, make a whole new border?
:'''Hu Tao:''' No, no, not the whole border &mdash; just the part that's been giving us grief. Which is just as well &mdash; reconstructing the whole thing would be much more difficult.
:{{DIcon}} What is this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method?
:'''Hu Tao:''' The eight gates refer to eight key nodes in Liyue's [[Ley Line]]s: Life, Death, Repose, Concealment, Initiation, Terrain, Fright, and Injury. They can be used to direct the Ley Lines' energy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And the seven?
:'''Hu Tao:''' That's the requirement for activating the array. The array master will select one gate from the eight to subdue evil, cutting off its exit path by using the Ley Lines' power to obfuscate themselves.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...What do you mean, "obfuscate"?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 lanyan 03.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' As in, disappear from the Ley Lines completely, never to be seen again &mdash; taking the banished evil along with them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... so someone has to die for this to work? But... you can't seriously be considering this?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Now, now, don't worry! That's the traditional interpretation, but people just assumed that because the Lone Butterfly sacrificed herself.
:'''Hu Tao:''' But let's not forget, they were purifying a whole [[god]]! As bad as things are now, it's still a far cry from what they had to deal with. Besides, the border isn't completely ruined, so we're only fixing one part of it.
:'''Hu Tao:''' If you ask me, as long as the array master can withstand a huge blast of fetor, they'll be just fine.
:'''Ningguang:''' Oh? Do you have any proof to back up this statement, Director Hu?
:'''Hu Tao:''' My proof is that I know the most about life and death out of everybody here! Unless anyone wants to dispute that?
:'''Hu Tao:''' ...No one? Okay good. Looks like we're all in agreement. In that case, we can plan our next steps as soon as the Tianquan has found the remaining four gates.
:'''Ningguang:''' Director Hu...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hmm? Something to add, Lady Tianquan?
:'''Ningguang:''' No... There is something else that I'd like to ask about, but it might not be my place to do so. If you do not wish to answer, then please pretend I never said anything.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Sure, what is it?
:'''Ningguang:''' Do you believe that today's border crisis could have anything to do with the Wuwang Hill Disaster from over a decade ago?
:'''Hu Tao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? There was a disaster at Wuwang Hill? What happened?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 lanyan 04.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Some sort of natural disaster, wasn't it? There used to be a village there, but then there was a flood or something. It took a lot of lives, and all the survivors moved away.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 lanyan 05.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Hmm... But that doesn't explain how Wuwang Hill became the dark and gloomy place it is today. Maybe there was... more to it?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Phew...
:'''Hu Tao:''' No, Lady Tianquan. I don't think these two events are related.
:'''Ningguang:''' Excellent, well that puts my mind at ease. Everyone, let's meet here again in two days. We should know the locations of all the gates by then.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Alright. Well, I've still got a lot of preparations to make, so I'll be heading back to the funeral parlor now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 lanyan 06.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Sounds good. If we're all done here, I'd better get going too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Lan Yan, Paimon meant to ask. How did you know where to find Hu Tao? Did you already know something was wrong with the border?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 lanyan 07.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Oh, haha, that? Yeah, I definitely owe you an explanation. Why don't you meet me at the Adventurers' Guild later? I just need to write a letter to my family first. I want to let them know I'm fine, and I also have some questions I want to ask them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 13 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, then we'll see you at the Adventurers' Guild!

;(Talk to Ningguang, optional)
:'''Ningguang:''' Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} What's bothering you, Ningguang?
:'''Ningguang:''' The Wuwang Hill Disaster has always haunted me... Still, if Director Hu says the incidents are unrelated, I probably shouldn't pry any further...
----
;(Approach the Adventurer's Guild)
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 01.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! Over here! Perfect timing &mdash; I literally just posted my letter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 02.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Anyway, back to your question... Let me guess, you're probably thinking I predicted the border crisis with some kind of mysterious magic?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, yeah. Aren't the Lans of Chenyu Vale all experts at Qimen Divination, or something?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 03.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' *sigh* No, that's simply not true. Yes, the Qimen arts have been practiced in my clan for many generations, and yes, Wind Reader is listed as one of our ancestors in the genealogy...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 04.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' But my family are only distant relatives &mdash; we branched off from the main family line long ago. By my grandpa's generation, the only Qimen he knew was a few parlor tricks.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 05.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Put it like this &mdash; my grandpa makes a living telling fortunes in [[Yilong Wharf]], but I'm making more than him just selling my handmade arts and crafts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... So why exactly did you come to look for Hu Tao?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 06.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Because Grandpa's readings have gone sideways recently. The romance and career fortunes are doing okay, but when it comes to longevity, everyone's reading is suddenly saying they only have a few years left to live. It gave grandpa quite a fright.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 07.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Fearing backlash from his clients, he closed shop and shut himself away at home, trying to divine an answer to the strange readings. But after days and nights of divination, the only clue he got was: "Wangsheng Funeral Parlor."
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 08.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Right around that time, I happened to receive an invitation from the Ministry of Civil Affairs to organize a street fair. So, I figured I might as well drop by the funeral parlor to see what Director Hu might know about all this.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Wait, so... Your grandpa's divinations were correct all along, weren't they? The longevity readings were affected by the border crisis, and "Wangsheng Funeral Parlor" was the answer, because they can fix it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 09.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' It's certainly looking that way. Apparently, every soul in Liyue is now living under the creeping shadow of death, but so far, we are the only ones in the know.
:{{DIcon}} I have another question. What's the deal with this rattan figure?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 10.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Wait, that's the one I left at Miss Ying'er's shop... It's actually a product of genuine Qimen art. It's engraved with an exorcism sigil to absorb inauspicious energy in their owner's place, so they won't come to harm.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 11.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' I had no idea you'd been holding onto it all this time... Haha, I guess it was meant to be. You're more than welcome to keep it if you like.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 12.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' When I first arrived in Liyue Harbor, I passed by a large house, and felt a chill go down my spine. So I made a rattan figure, and gave it to the young master there.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 13.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Later on, I also sensed something similar around Timaeus, so I made another one, and left it at Scent of Spring.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 14.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Then, I followed Director Hu to Wuwang Hill, only to find she'd disappeared without a trace. While I was searching the area, I found Miss Qiqi. She was stuck in some kind of crevice, and she seemed to be blocking something from coming through.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 15.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' When I tried to pull her out, we both got pulled in to a cold, dark place... which, I soon discovered, was the border.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 16.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' We wandered around aimlessly for a while until we ran into Director Hu. She'd lit some incense and was burning fetor left and right with a flaming staff.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 17.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' But there was just too much... There was no way she could hope to get rid of it all. Worse still, the fetor blocked off the way we'd come in, trapping us inside. Thank goodness you came to our rescue!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, what an ordeal... Still, your family sounds more impressive than you let on &mdash; didn't you use some kind of illusion magic in the border?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 18.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Ah, yes. Actually, that and the rattan figures are things I learned from one of my cousins in the main branch of my family. She's been practicing the Qimen arts since she was little. She's also the one I posed some questions to in my letter back home.
:{{DIcon}} Questions about the Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 19.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Wow. Good guess... Yes, I want to know for sure whether sacrificing one of the participants is a necessary part of the method or not. I figured she might know.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But Hu Tao already told us it won't come to that... She said we just need to make sure the person can withstand a strong blast of fetor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 20.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Mm... I certainly hope that's true, but I can't help but feel uneasy about it. I haven't known Director Hu for long, but... I get the sense that she prefers to keep the truth bottled up sometimes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 21.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Sure, she talks a lot, and isn't afraid to broach dark and uncomfortable topics. But she really hasn't said much in the way of her own, private thoughts. It's like she's already got a plan, and is keeping it to herself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean... You think she lied to us...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 22.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' I wouldn't call it "lying," per se, but... remember when the Tianquan asked about the incident at Wuwang Hill from a decade ago?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! Hu Tao said that it doesn't have anything to do with what's happening now. Are you saying they actually are related?
:{{DIcon}} Do you know anything about what happened back then, Lan Yan?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 23.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' I just heard that there was a flood. But given everything that's going on, I think it likely had to do with the border as well. That would at least explain the strange weather going on at Wuwang Hill.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 24.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' I remember my cousin saying that around that time, the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor set up an altar on top of the hill. I just assumed it was for a funeral, but now, I can't help but wonder if it was some sort of ritual to try and fix the border.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 25.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Anyway, the ceremony was hosted jointly by two former directors of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Namely, Hu Tao's [[Hu Tao's Father|father]] and [[Old Hu|grandfather]].

:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, really? Hu Tao's never mentioned her dad to us before... How strange. So you think there's more to this story, huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 lanyan 26.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Yeah... But since she brushed it aside when the Tianquan asked her about it, I don't see how I can broach the topic. I've only known her for a few days...
:{{DIcon}} I guess we should go talk to Hu Tao ourselves.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You think we should ask her about it? But she's never opened up to us about family stuff before... What if she shuts us out?
:{{DIcon}} Then that's her choice. All we can do is try.
:{{DIcon}} Then you can keep poking her till she tells us the truth.
::{{A|vo eqhdj402 15 paimon 10b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! That isn't very nice!

;(Approach Hu Tao at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor)
:'''Hu Tao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hu Tao!
:'''Hu Tao:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! What's up? We haven't spoken in five minutes and you're missing me already?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! So we thought we'd come hang out with you. What were you looking at just now?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Something so amazing, you wouldn't believe it. But I'm not showing you.
:{{DIcon}} Why? ...Is it a secret photo of me?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hahaha! Seriously though, you probably shouldn't joke about that. You don't wanna jinx it...
:{{DIcon}} Jinx it how?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Well, the people in this picture keep appearing in my dreams lately, and none of them are around anymore... So keeping you out of the picture is probably for the best.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Haha, alright, I'll quit joking around. Here, take a look.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, are they...?
:<gallery widths="350">
The Funeral Parlor Has No Master, Yujing Terrace Calls the Troops Quest Still 2.png
</gallery>
:'''Hu Tao:''' Yeah, my dad and my grandpa. Without this picture, I'd probably have forgotten what my dad looked like by now. When he passed, I was still too young to understand what was going on.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Everything I know about my dad, I learned from my grandpa.
:{{DIcon}} So... what happened to him?
:'''Hu Tao:''' There was a border incident on Wuwang Hill about a dozen years ago. My dad tried using the Art of Homa to burn away the fetor, but he slipped up and suffered a lethal exposure to it. He died on the spot.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's awful... So, is that what made Wuwang Hill the way it is today?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Yep. His mistake didn't just cost him his own life &mdash; it took most of the village out, and left lasting changes on Wuwang Hill itself.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Thankfully, my grandpa managed to deal with the fallout &mdash; but that's not to say he escaped unscathed... He didn't even make it to sixty before he passed.
:{{DIcon}} So your grandpa was affected by the incident with your dad?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Well, he never admitted it, of course. But given how fit and healthy he was before that, I would've expected him to have a few more years in him...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like... You blame your dad for all of this...
:'''Hu Tao:''' How could I not? It would be one thing if he was just a spoiled brat who never amounted to anything. But he was a genius. He was, and still is, the best spellcaster in [[Hu Family|our family]] for generations.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Grandpa always called me gifted for mastering the Wangsheng arts by the age of eight, but by the time my dad was eight, he was already hosting rituals and incinerating fetor all by himself.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Fixing the border crisis should have been a piece of cake for him, and he messed up. Who else is there to blame, if not him?
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... Maybe the question is, why did he mess up?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Because he was an unworthy director. Every past director has burned away all of their belongings when they pass on, leaving at most one or two items behind.
:'''Hu Tao:''' My grandpa, for example, left only his hat behind. But my dad? He left a whole pile of stuff, including this meaningless picture...
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But doesn't that just show how much he cared...?
:'''Hu Tao:''' No &mdash; all it shows is that he was unable to let go. And the fact that he couldn't let go is precisely why he failed during that ritual.
:'''Hu Tao:''' He was too attached to his aging father, his young daughter, and the world where we were all together.
:'''Hu Tao:''' That's why he hesitated in that final moment. Because he was afraid to die, he lost focus, and death won, taking his life and many others.
:'''Hu Tao:''' In this line of work, we know better than anyone how hard letting go can be. We see it all the time. But as funeral directors, it's the one thing we cannot allow ourselves to fall victim to.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Like Grandpa always said, we should live in life, and die in death... That's the whole basis of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's existence.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Unfortunately, with my dad, these teachings went in one ear and out the other. He really let everyone down.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You don't need to be so hard on him... Sure, he made a mistake, but he can't have meant for things to turn out this way.
:'''Hu Tao:''' You're missing the point, my little Paimon. It's precisely because he's my dad that I choose not to hold back.
:'''Hu Tao:''' There isn't a father in the world who would disapprove of their daughter being outspoken. Because a father's biggest fear is that once he's not around anymore, his daughter will never get to be that carefree, sassy little kid ever again.
:'''Hu Tao:''' So, I'm gonna keep talking trash about him all I want. And on the off chance he ever overhears me, I know he'll take some comfort from knowing that I never stopped just being myself and living my life my way.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Anyway, so that's a brief history of Wuwang Hill for you. Anything else on the agenda?
:{{DIcon}} Thank you for being so open with us.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, did you think I'd hide it from you? Nah, we're better buds than that.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Plus, you did just rescue me from the border, so I owe you bigtime. Answering your questions seems like the least I can do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Alright, in that case, Paimon has one last question! Earlier, you said that no one will have to die when the array is activated... Is that the truth?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Yes. In my highly professional opinion, yes!
:{{A|vo eqhdj402 17 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, phew. That's all Paimon wanted to hear.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Try not to dwell too much on all this stuff, okay? There are still two days to go, so check out the street fair and enjoy yourself. You said it yourself, remember? Gotta keep a reasonable work-life balance.
:'''Hu Tao:''' I'll see you at Yujing Terrace in two days. This time, we're gonna turn death to ashes!
:;(Quest completes)

;(Talk to Hu Tao, optional)
:'''Hu Tao:''' Guys, seriously &mdash; go rest and relax while you can! We have a big job coming up in two days' time.
