'''Remarkable Chests''' are special [[chests]] found in [[Liyue]]'s [[Chenyu Vale]], [[Inazuma]]'s [[Tsurumi Island]], [[Sumeru]], [[Fontaine]], and [[Natlan]] that give [[Furnishing Blueprint]]s. Remarkable Chests outside of Tsurumi Island also give 5 Primogems each.

There are currently '''{{Category Total|Remarkable Chest Furnishings}}''' blueprints available from Remarkable Chests. Though there is no achievement directly related to Remarkable Chests, the total number of Remarkable Chests found can be checked on the [[HoYoLAB]] app under "Battle Chronicle." The Remarkable Chests also count towards the achievement counts of their respective regions for opening chests.

==Furnishing Blueprints==
Learning these blueprints allows players to create furnishings using the [[Creation]] system. Most Remarkable Chests for these blueprints are unlocked by defeating the surrounding enemies; however, some chests spawn after completing open-world challenges or puzzles.

===Tsurumi Island===
Certain Remarkable Chests on Tsurumi Island only spawn by progressing through the {{Quest|Through the Mists}}.

Most Remarkable Chests are found in the world surrounded by enemies which must be defeated first. These chests are subject to the [[Tsurumi Island#Three-Day Cycle|Three-Day Cycle]] and will only appear on one of the three days; thus, it takes at least three days to collect all the chests. Some Remarkable Chests are spawned using the [[Peculiar Pinion]], a gadget obtained on the second day of ''Through the Mists''.
