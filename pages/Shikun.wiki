==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shikun:''' Greetings, my guest! Our village is just a few more steps to the north if you follow this path!
:{{DIcon}} Distinguished guests?
::'''Shikun:''' Every visitor is a guest, and we will do our best to host them.
::'''Shikun:''' There's an extraordinary aura of elegance about you. You might bring us good fortune, I reckon, and that makes you an important guest indeed!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Shikun:''' Tradition dictates that those who're in good health must help their neighbors once they're done with their own work.
::'''Shikun:''' [[Uncle Luo]], the village elder, arranges our shifts. Several of us are in the south, and several more in the north, so we're always prepared.
::'''Shikun:''' If anyone needs help, they only have to talk to us.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} So how is the pay calculated?
:::'''Shikun:''' Nah, it's not, we're way too close to worry about formalities like that!
:::'''Shikun:''' After we helped them out, the neighbors treated us to dinner and we had a few drinks together! That counts as payment!
:::'''Shikun:''' Yeah, I even moved a bunch of clothes and books for [[Deyin]] a couple of days ago, and he made some killer egg soup!
:::'''Shikun:''' If you have some time, you should go chat with him and let him tell you stories about Chenyu Vale!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Shikun:''' Farewell for now. Come find me anytime you need help.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shikun:''' Once tonight's shift is over, I should be able to get in a few drinks with my brothers...
:{{DIcon}} You even do night shifts!?
::'''Shikun:''' Hey, some tea farmers start toiling away at three or four in the morning! A helping hand's always welcome in that pitch darkness!
::'''Shikun:''' Someone like me, who isn't busy but has plenty of energy to spare, is the perfect candidate for that sort of night shift. Call me and I'll be there!
::'''Shikun:''' The wee hours are great for getting things done. It's so quiet, so you can work away without getting distracted!
:{{DIcon}} You've got lots of brothers then?
::'''Shikun:''' Oh no, they're not actually my brothers! We're just a group of pals who work together regularly.
::'''Shikun:''' I'm one of the younger ones, so I call them my big brothers!
::'''Shikun:''' We often help our neighbors out, and in return, they've dubbed us the "Six Little Dragons of Qiaoying Village."
::'''Shikun:''' I'm the fourth oldest, so that makes me "Fourth Dragon"! Haha...
::'''Shikun:''' These past two years, Fifth and Sixth have left to work as a bodyguard and a boatman respectively. Third's found a job at [[Yilong Wharf]]...
::'''Shikun:''' So it's usually just the three of us &mdash; First, Second, and little old Fourth &mdash; drinking and chatting about our families.
::'''Shikun:''' As fulfilling as a hard day's work is, a lazy day's not a bad day either!
:{{DIcon}} Have fun then!
::'''Shikun:''' Thanks, you too!
