;(Approach the area)
:{{Black Screen|You continue to run the potion shop. Thanks to all your hard work, your earnings surpass expectations...}}
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Wow, I have to hand it to you, cuties. I never imagined that you'd be able to bring in so much Mora in such a short amount of time...
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' You're practically geniuses when it comes to business.
:{{DIcon}} It's all thanks to your help.
::{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 03a 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe, always so humble...
::{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 03a 2.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Although, with results this impressive, I would say you could stand to take a bit more credit.
:{{DIcon}} We just got the hang of it along the way.
::{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 03b 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hm, a testament to your ability to learn on the job.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' If I had your help all the time, I bet I could take double the amount of vacation without a care in the world.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' With all your hard work up to this point, we've already collected enough sales data for our research. Thank you so much for all your help.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Of course, if you're interested in continuing to run the shop, you'd make me a very happy Lisa.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' In either case, I should already have more than enough to report back to Jean with.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, it's been a long time.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Jean!
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh, you're here! I wrapped up some business with my cuties, and was just about to go report back to you at headquarters.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' No need. I already talked to some other knights, so I think I have fairly good understanding of the situation.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Looks like you've troubled {{Traveler}} to help you once again?
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 09.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe, how could I not? When it comes to work as important as this, a smart and capable partner is simply a must have &mdash; especially if we want good results.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 10.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Look at the success of the shop! I could have never produced that kind of result on my own.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Well, I do have to admit, your success is remarkable.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I've been meaning to come see you for some time now, but work kept getting in the way, and I simply couldn't find the time... Regardless, I just knew I had to come thank you in person.
:{{DIcon}} We should thank you for your support as well.
:{{DIcon}} It was a group effort.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' It's truly reassuring to have such outstanding members among our ranks.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 11.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe, once this is all over, I do believe I'm due for a vacation.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 12.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I've lost quite a few strands of hair to all the stress.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Of course. Thank you for all your hard work.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Seeing you cooped up in that library all the time, I was worried you might be bored. So I thought I'd give you an opportunity to truly make use of your talents.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Perhaps I put too much on your plate at once...
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 13.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It wasn't that bad. After all, it's not like I was in it alone. All the help from the Knights and {{Traveler}} really helped to lessen the load.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 14.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Plus, it was fun to get back into research. It's nice to relive those days every once in a while.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I'm glad to hear that.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 qin 11.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Thank you again for all your help, {{Traveler}}. Please take this as your compensation.
:{{A|vo jyeq004b 1 lisa 15.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Ah, speaking of compensation, I've also prepared a little memento for you. Here, I hope you like it!

;(Talk to Lisa or Jean, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jyeq004b qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Public reception towards alchemical potions has been much more favorable than expected.
:{{A|vo dialog jyeq004b qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' If things continue like this, the potions industry could end up becoming a new revenue stream for the entire region of Mondstadt...
:{{A|vo dialog jyeq004b lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' We've got more than enough time to make big plans for the future. Right now, we should focus on the hard-earned success we've been able to achieve so far. How about we find a time to celebrate together?
:{{A|vo dialog jyeq004b paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, a celebration! As long as there's yummy food, Paimon's in!
:{{A|vo dialog jyeq004b lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Of course. Once I've made the preparations, you'll be the first to know. I'll even do you the honor of extending your invitation in person, hehe.
:{{A|vo dialog jyeq004b qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' That does sound nice. You certainly deserve to relax after all your hard work.
