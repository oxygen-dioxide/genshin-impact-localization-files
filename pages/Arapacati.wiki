==Profile==
Arapacati is the "sister" of [[Arasaka]], [[Araphala]], [[Arapas]] and [[Arachatora]]. They met the [[Traveler's Sibling]] when they wandered [[Teyvat]]; after they departed, Arapacati's "brothers" wanted to cook like the "Nara Varuna," although they had a huge argument and their concept of cooking was different to that of human cooking. Arapacati was angered enough that she kicked her brothers out of Vanarana.

When the [[Traveler]] arrived to obtain a [[Bija]] for [[Rana]], they were told they needed to host a [[Festival Utsava]] and would need as many Aranara as possible to return to Vanarana first. They met with Arapacati, who told them that her brothers were scattered across Sumeru's forest and told them where they could find them and help them back to their senses with {{Dendro}} if necessary. After they found her brothers, who returned to Vanarana after helping them out, Arapacati scolded them for not working together and going to dangerous places, causing them to sob.

During Festival Utsava, Arapacati asked the Traveler to teach her brothers human cooking, since she knew that their "cooking" was not expected of human cooking. Upon trying their food, she found it different, but to make them happy, she and her brothers made themselves happy as to not dampen the Traveler's spirits.

===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Available after ''[[An Unwavering Culinary Dream]]'')
:'''Arapacati:''' Nara {{Traveler}}! Festival Utsava has not started. So food, not ready.
:{{DIcon}} About brothers...
::'''Arapacati:''' [[Arachatora]], [[Arasaka]], [[Arapas]], and [[Araphala]] ran away with sobs, after Arapacati got angry.
::'''Arapacati:''' They have been making food and repenting, carefully.
::'''Arapacati:''' Thanks to Nara {{Traveler}}, or they will keep seeing cooking training as the most important, and forget Arapacati's words about no fights.
:{{DIcon}} About Nara Varuna...
::'''Arapacati:''' Nara Varuna cooks many many dishes.
::'''Arapacati:''' Brothers afraid of fire, however. They didn't see the cooking clearly, and started cooking training after Nara Varuna left.
::'''Arapacati:''' Nara {{Traveler}} is Golden Nara, too. Nara {{Traveler}} must know how to cook many many dishes.
::'''Arapacati:''' Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala will take a closer look this time, and learn about Nara cooking.
:{{DIcon}} Good luck with the preparation.
::'''Arapacati:''' Yes! For Festival Utsava, Arapacati will.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Available after ''[["Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye"]]'')
:'''Arapacati:''' Nara {{Traveler}} enjoys a special taste, so brothers and sister want "special cooking training."
:{{DIcon}} Special cooking training?
::'''Arapacati:''' Yes, Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas and Araphala remember "the taste of happiness" of Nara. Very special, more special than any smell in the forest.
::'''Arapacati:''' So they want "special cooking training." We'll share "the taste of happiness," when Nara {{Traveler}} comes back.
::'''Arapacati:''' Hope they don't be so silly this time.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Let's hope this goes smoothly...
:::'''Arapacati:''' Yes, it will be fine. Aranara are all afraid of fire, except for us brothers and sisters. That's why Arapacati made this pot. With this pot, the fire will be very, very small &mdash; not too hot and not too scary.
:::'''Arapacati:''' Arapacati made one for Nara {{Traveler}} as a show of thanks. I hope that the scent of happiness will always be with Nara {{Traveler}}.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Taste of Warmth|20|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} Brothers and sister...
::'''Arapacati:''' Nara Varuna looked so happy, so joyful, when talking about {{MC|m=brothers|f=sisters}}. Nara are weird. Why are "brothers" and "sisters" so special?
::'''Arapacati:''' We later decided, we should be "brothers" and "sisters," to make everyone happy and joyful.
::'''Arapacati:''' At first, Arapacati was "brother." But the "sister" back then is gone now. Before being Vasara Tree, he decided that Arapacati should be "sister."
::'''Arapacati:''' Who should be "sister" next time...
:{{DIcon}} Good luck with the training.
::'''Arapacati:''' Yes! We will make the taste that gives Nara {{Traveler}} happiness.
