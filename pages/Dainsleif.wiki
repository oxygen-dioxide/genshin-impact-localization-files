'''Dainsleif''', sometimes shortened to '''Dain''', is an upcoming playable [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. He is the featured character for [[Chapter ??]] of the [[Archon Quests|Teyvat Chapter Storyline]], which focuses on the lost kingdom of [[Khaenri'ah]], as well as the narrator of the [[Collected Miscellany]] videos. He makes his first in-game appearance in the {{Quest|Bough Keeper: Dainsleif}}.

Dainsleif is the former knight captain of the Royal Guard of [[Khaenri'ah]]. However, he failed to prevent the destruction of Khaenri'ah 500 years ago. A curse of immortality was placed upon him so that he would forever wander [[Teyvat]].

Dainsleif was announced to be an upcoming playable character on September 27, 2020, in the [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rv411C7kX/?t=2830 stream] celebrating the global release of ''Genshin Impact'', although he is not expected to be released for a significant amount of time. The listed name of his Vision's element, as announced on his Chinese Character Card, is a set of indecipherable symbols ([[File:Character Dainsleif Vision.svg|40px]]).<ref>Chinese HoYoLAB: [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/1897062 {{zh|「拾枝者」 ·戴因斯雷布}}]</ref>

==Official Introduction==
{{Official Introduction
|title="Bough Keeper" &mdash; Dainsleif
|link=https://www.hoyolab.com/article/18296
|character=Dainsleif
}}
The confluence between the past and future.

The original calamity had been overturned, yet the island in the sky set the earth to burn. Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon. The future must atone for bygone mistakes, as the bond familiar falters and breaks&mdash; of the same blood, elders and the youth... Such is the cycle of the world, in truth. Dain, what is that strand of blonde hair to you? Someone you must kill? Or the object of your penitence?

&mdash;A self-proclaimed prophet
