Dainsleif is the former knight captain of the Royal Guard of [[Khaenri'ah]]. However, he failed to prevent the destruction of Khaenri'ah 500 years ago. He was placed with a curse of immortality to forever wander [[Teyvat]].

Dainsleif was announced to be an upcoming playable character on September 27, 2020, in the [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pK411P7rX?from=search&seid=10632215045301386412 stream] celebrating the global release of ''Genshin Impact'', although he is not expected to be released for a significant amount of time.

==Official Introduction==
{{Official Introduction

}}

The confluence between the past and future.

The original calamity had been overturned, yet the island in the sky set the earth to burn. Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon. The future must atone for bygone mistakes, as the bond familiar falters and breaks&mdash; of the same blood, elders and the youth... Such is the cycle of the world, in truth. Dain, what is that strand of blonde hair to you? Someone you must kill? Or the object of your penitence?

&mdash;A self-proclaimed prophet.

==Profile==
===Personality===
{{Quote|Dainsleif is a man of mysterious origins but claims to have knowledge of fate itself.|[https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1325704179181002752 Official Twitter EN and JP VA Announcement]}}
Dainsleif is an enigmatic character, but glimpses of his persona can be captured through the narrations of the Collected Miscellany videos and the Teyvat Chapter Storyline video.

Dainsleif claims that his memory has "all but faded," yet is seemingly able to vividly recall the events of the [[Cataclysm|Fall of Khaenri'ah]]. Additionally, he is also somehow able to recall many of the events that occurred in Mondstadt from thousands of years ago, including stories of [[Andrius]], the Wolf King of the North and [[Dvalin]], the Dragon of the East.

He appears to be a curious person, questioning how someone as diligent as [[Jean]] is able to press on so tenaciously, and insists that he will find the answer to his own inquiry.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/_FOkixTeAaA Jean's Collected Miscellany]</ref> He also notes how [[Zhongli]]'s placid attitude towards the fall of [[Morax]] as interesting, and wonders if Zhongli could be a player in the Rite of Descension. To his own theory of Zhongli, he persists on waiting, for he does not "lack time."<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/NRXhkjan52A Zhongli's Collected Miscellany]</ref> In "Bough Keeper: Dainsleif", his curiosity is all the more evident as he requires three answered questions from the Traveler regarding recent issues concerning mortals and deities, along with 500 Mora, in order for him to become available as an ally of the Traveler during particularly difficult commissions regarding the Abyss Order.

Although Dainsleif detests deities that side with the Seven and dislikes the [[adepti]] for signing contracts with [[Rex Lapis]], he has great respect for those who are hard at work, such as [[Ganyu]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/tsPtGG9pFfg Ganyu's Collected Miscellany]</ref> He also greatly respects [[Diluc]]'s unwavering attitude when it comes to protecting [[Mondstadt]], but wonders if his resolve would stay the same if Diluc were to experience the same disaster that he had witnessed himself; the fall of Khaenri'ah.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/1TfbiDo7N4k Diluc's Collected Miscellany]</ref>

While indifferent to most crises, Dainsleif states that he would not tolerate the dangers posed from his former homeland, as he is only interested in opposing the Abyss Order. Likewise, he is particularly wary of [[Albedo]] due to his knowledge on the Art of Khemia, a form of alchemy that brought ruin to Khaenri'ah, and would personally intervene if Albedo made a single mistake with it.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/xOJfaOI87XU Albedo's Collected Miscellany]</ref>

At one uncertain point in time, Dainsleif desired to take fate into his own hands.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/lf_b7_5oAZk Keqing's Collected Miscellany]</ref>
===Appearance===
Dainsleif is a tall man with light blonde hair and sea blue eyes. He has the same [[Primogem]]-shaped pupils as [[Kaeya]], and wears a mask-like eyepatch covering the right side of his face while still showing his right eye. Dainsleif wears a black jacket with blue details, a grey vest, and black pants along with black armored gloves and boots. He also wears a black cape with a starry, space-patterned interior.

Parts of the right side of his body appear to be covered in a blue veined pattern; namely his right arm, part of his right foot, the upper portion of his right pectoral, and as a faintly visible streak along the right side of his neck. This is more prominent in his artwork that depicts him demonstrating his abilities; in which the glowing veins marble the entire length of a fully blackened right arm, with a similar effect appearing on the foot.

==Quests and Events==
{{Quest Appearances}}

==Trivia==
*Dainsleif is titled the {{Lang|"Bough Keeper"|zh=拾枝者|zh_rm=Shízhī-zhě|zh_tl=Bough Picker}} in-game and in the trailers.
**"Bough" is a likely reference to boughs and branches of [[Irminsul]], the Tree of Ley Lines, which are containers of travel experiences of the time-flourished world. Dainsleif is rich in experiences and memories throughout his life of "picking and keeping boughs."
*Dainsleif narrates the [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail|Teyvat Storyline Preview]], as well as the [[Collected Miscellany]] videos (with the exception of [[Aloy]]'s, which is narrated by [[Alice]] instead).
**The Chinese version of "Collected Miscellany" is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=拾枝杂谈|zh_tl=Picking Bough Miscellany}}, a reference to his title.<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/av797334847/ Chinese Collected Miscellany Videos]</ref> Thus Collected Miscellany videos can be seen as his comments on each of the characters he had previously met.
**In the Teyvat Storyline Trailer, his dialogue switches to first person at the Khaenri'ah section.
*Dainsleif's immortality was first hinted at in his narration in [[Venti]]'s [[Collected Miscellany]], [https://youtu.be/uwNXNHazS-I&t=30s Venti: Skyward Sonnet], where he says: "A thousand years have passed since the [[Barbatos|God of Anemo]] left [[Mondstadt|this land]]. But to me, it has only been half that time."
*Although Dainsleif is confirmed to be a playable character in the future, his character card lists [[File:Character Dainsleif Vision.png|30px]] for his Vision element and he does not have a visible Vision on him.
**Dainsleif's abilities are briefly shown in [[We Will Be Reunited]]. His hand is surrounded by a dark blue, galaxy-like aura when restraining an [[Abyss Herald]] without physical contact.

===Etymology===
*In Norse mythology, {{w|Dáinsleif}} is the name of king Högni's sword, crafted by the dwarf {{w|Dáinn (Norse dwarf)|Dáinn}}. When drawn, the sword cannot be sheathed again unless it has taken a life.
**Dáinn can also refer to the four stags of {{w|Yggdrasill}}, {{w|Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór}}. The four stags feast on the branches of the tree of Yggdrasill. "Stormterror" [[Dvalin]] also shares a name with one of the four stags.
