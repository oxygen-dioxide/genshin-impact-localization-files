'''Refinement Ranks''' are upgrades to [[Weapon]]s that increase the effectiveness of their [[Passive (Weapon)|Passive]]. [[1-Star Weapon|1-Star]] and [[2-Star Weapon|2-Star]] Weapons cannot be refined.

If a weapon of Refinement Rank 2 or higher is used as refinement material, all refinement history of all copies of weapons involved will be considered when calculating the final Refinement Rank. For example, if a Refinement Rank 2 Favonius Lance is used as material to refine another Refinement Rank 2 Favonius Lance, the process will result in a Refinement Rank 4 Favonius Lance. Any exceeded refinement materials will not be refunded if the maximum refinement is reached.

==Refinement Costs==
Refining a Weapon requires a copy of the Weapon or the Weapon's [[Refinement Material]], as well as [[Mora]].
