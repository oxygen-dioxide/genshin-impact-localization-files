{{Description|A mystic plant that grows in the heart of the forest. Seems to be sentient.}}
{{Location Intro|The '''Tree of Dreams'''|description=<p>[[Offering]] [[Dendro Sigil]]s to the Tree of Dreams will increase the level of [[Vanarana's Favor]] and unlock rewards.</p>}}

Access to the Tree of Dreams is unlocked by completing the {{Quest|Trees and Dreams}}, which is available after completing the {{Quest|The World of Aranara}}. The tree is only marked on the map once visited for the first time.

In the Dream State, the Tree of Dreams changes from green to a luminescent purple. After raising Vanarana's Favor to its maximum, the leaves atop the tree will spread out.

==Lore==
After the [[Cataclysm]], [[Araja]] turned his original body into the Tree of Dreams to create the dream version of Vanarana (Mahavanaranapna), as only in that form could he sustain a dream big enough for the other Aranara.

==Trivia==
* [[Arama]] also refers to "the very first Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams," which has its roots in Sarva.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|For Fruits, Seeds, and Trees}}</ref> It is unclear if this is the same as Araja's Tree of Dreams, but it seems not.
** "The very first Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams" can also be seen in the dreams of other [[Vasara Tree]]s.
