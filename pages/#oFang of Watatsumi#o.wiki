==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You must first break the five seals on Watatsumi Island if you wish to enter Enkanomiya.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On approaching the "Fang")
:'''[[Paimon]]:''' And this must be the "Fang"...
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|An ancient stone tablet stands beside the shrine. Will there be anything of use written on it?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On examining the tablet nearby)
:'''Ancient Stone Tablet:''' "...To provoke battle, to defend, and end them quickly, and thus take unto oneself the spoils &mdash; 'tis the way of Watatsumi, marked in tooth and claw..."
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... There's barely anything legible here. Paimon guesses we'll need to fight and protect something... so we can get the Spirit Pearls... or something.
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|With the help of the stone tablet's instructions, perhaps breaking the shrine seal will not be a problem... Right?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Dialogue before 1st wave)
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, be careful!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, lots of hilichurls incoming!

;(Dialogue before 5th wave)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, why are these Treasure Hoarders and bandits also here?
:'''Paimon:''' Look out! Those guys look pretty tough!
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|You have finally broken the shrine's seal, and the Spirit Pearl is yours to claim. Go forth and take it!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On examining the shrine - if this was the first shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' We found a pearl. Is this the Spirit Pearl Tsuyuko talked about?

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the second shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' There's another Spirit Pearl!

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the third shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' And that's a third! We're getting close!

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the fourth shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' Fourth Spirit Pearl obtained! Let's go find Tsuyuko!
