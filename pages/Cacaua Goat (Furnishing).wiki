|description    = These gentle beasts can be found all over Teyvat and were among the earliest livestock tamed by humans.<br>Contrary to what the name might suggest, Cacaua Goats do not give off a uniquely bitter odor. This unforgettable name originates from the hue of their wool, which closely resembles that of food and drink made from Cacahuatl.<br>Since arriving in The Realm Within, Cacaua Goats have become popular among small birds who like to nest within their soft wool. After all, wool of such a pure chocolatey color is a rare sight in nature...
