The Fantastic Compass is a magic device created by adeptus [[Sea Gazer]] used to seal away monsters.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/C24nvloZZhE Perilous Trail Event Cutscene Animation: "Moment of Life or Death" | Genshin Impact] (Video Description)</ref> Later, Sea Gazer became good friends with a human and gave the device to him to use as a catalyst. A few years later, great demons began haunting the mountains and the mortal and the [[adeptus]] joined forces to exorcise them using this device.<ref name="ATEL">{{Ref/Quest|At Tunnel's End, Light}}</ref>

500 years ago, [[Boyang]] and [[Rongzhao]], two brothers who were ancestors of [[Yelan]], were gifted the Fantastic Compass by someone of great importance.<ref name="ATEL" /> Perhaps Yelan's clan studied the device because Yelan mentions that the compass is very similar to catalysts made by her clan that only they know how to use.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Danger All Around}}</ref>

When the [[cataclysm]] began, the two brothers were ordered by the [[Qixing]] to take the compass with them to aid the [[Millelith]] in the battle at [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]] against the monsters of the Abyss.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Note of Unknown Origin}}</ref> During the fight, they discovered [[The Chasm's Bed]] and lured the monsters deeper into the depths of the Chasm. Together, [[Boyang]] and [[Bosacius]] used the Fantastic Compass to seal the intersection between the Chasm's Bed and the rest of the Chasm, granting Liyue victory over the monsters with the compass being lost since then.

In the present day, [[Yanfei]] found a will in an old book. The writer of the will had wished to find the Fantastic Compass and wrote that they gave the magical device to [[Boyang|someone ambitious]], hoping it'd be handy in times of need. According to Yanfei, an eye-witness account said the person who received it took it into The Chasm and the device has been missing since. This implies that the writer of the will is the one who gifted the Compass to Boyang. The book that the will was in describes the device: "When mortal and adepti powers are combined, one can move the heavens and shake the earth. This contraption is proof that mortals and adepti may coexist, that there is unity between heaven and humanity." As a legal consultant, Yanfei took it upon herself to execute the will.<ref name="ATEL" />

During ''[[Perilous Trail]]'', Yanfei, Yelan, [[Arataki Itto]], [[Kuki Shinobu]], the [[Traveler]], and [[Paimon]] found themselves trapped in the Chasm's Bed, later joined by [[Xiao]] who had entered on his own only to find it was even more dangerous than he was expecting. Although they wouldn't reasonably be able to find the original compass, the group devises a plan to use the [[The Chasm's Bed#Effects|abilities of the Chasm's Bed]] against it by imagining the compass so that the Chasm's Bed will conjure it. After it briefly reacts when Yelan and Xiao happen to touch it at the same time, Yanfei recalled the words from the book and then attempts to use her power on it to test a working theory, since she has both adepti and human lineage; the device activated for but a moment since Yanfei is not strong enough, but it confirms to her that human magic and adepti power is required. The brief activation seemed to trigger something, causing the voices of Boyang and Bosacius to be heard from when they made the seal:

{{Dialogue End}}
After Yanfei's explanation of how to use the Fantastic Compass, Yelan and Xiao activated the device together to escape The Chasm's Bed. Because the compass they used was a conjuring of The Chasm's Bed and not the original, it dissipated and vanished moments after being exposed to normal spacetime.
