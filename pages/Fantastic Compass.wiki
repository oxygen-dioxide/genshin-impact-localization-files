The Fantastic Compass is a magic device created by [[Sea Gazer]]<ref>Video description of [https://youtu.be/C24nvloZZhE Perilous Trail Event Cutscene Animation: "Moment of Life or Death" | Genshin Impact]</ref> a millennia ago to seal away evil monsters. Later, Sea Gazer became good friends with a human and gave the device to him to use as a catalyst. A few years later, great demons began haunting the mountains and the mortal and the adeptus joined forces to exorcise them using this device.<ref name="ATEL">{{Ref/Quest|At Tunnel's End, Light}}</reF>

Hundreds of years later, [[Boyang]] and [[Rongzhao]], two brothers who were ancestors of [[Yelan]], were gifted the Fantastic Compass by someone of great importance.<ref name="ATEL" /> Perhaps Yelan's clan studied the device because Yelan mentions that the compass is very similar to catalysts made by her clan that only they know how to use.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Danger All Around}}</ref>

When the [[Cataclysm]] began, the two brothers were ordered by the [[Qixing]] to take the compass with them to aid the [[Millelith]] in the battle at [[The Chasm]] against the monsters of the Abyss.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Note of Unknown Origin}}</ref> During the fight, they discovered [[The Chasm's Bed]] and lured the monsters deeper into the depths of the Chasm. Together, [[Boyang]] and [[Bosacius]] used the Fantastic Compass to seal the intersection between the Chasm's Bed and the rest of the Chasm, granting Liyue victory over the monsters with the compass being lost since then.

Much later on, [[Yanfei]] found a will in an old book. The writer of the will had wished to find the Fantastic Compass and wrote that they gave the magical device to [[Boyang|someone ambitious]], hoping it'd be handy in times of need. According to Yanfei, an eye-witness account said the person who received it took it into The Chasm and the device has been missing since. This implies that the writer of the will is the one who gifted the Compass to Boyang.

The book that the will was in describes the device: "When mortal and adepti powers are combined, one can move the heavens and shake the earth. This contraption is proof that mortals and adepti may coexist, that there is unity between heaven and humanity."<ref name="ATEL" /> While stuck in the Chasm's Bed, Yanfei attempted to use the device to see if it works, since she has both adepti and human lineage. The device activated but only for a moment since Yanfei is not strong enough. The brief activation seemed to trigger something, causing the voices of Boyang and Bosacius to be heard from when they made the seal:

:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 together 01.ogg}} '''Sound From Within the Compass:''' By heaven's might and the gods of the five regions, yaksha and mortal together take this contraption in hand...
{{Dialogue end}}
After Yanfei tested the device, Yelan and Xiao activated the device together to escape The Chasm's Bed.
