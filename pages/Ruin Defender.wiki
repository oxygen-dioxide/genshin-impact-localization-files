{{Description|Various bizarrely-shaped machines that have taken different forms and functions to adapt to different goals.<br />Legend has it that they are war machines left behind by a nation that has already been destroyed. Compared to the more common [[Ruin Guard]]s, their design has greater value in the study of biomimesis. The insect-like limbs are more agile than humanoid machines. The shield formed by its various components can resist any frontal attack.|[[Archive]]}}

==Attacks and abilities==
''Names are unofficial''
* '''Pincer Stab:''' Raising itself on its hind legs, the Defender stabs with its two front legs, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}. Its core is protected during this attack.

* '''Armored Carapace Array:''' Projects a shield from its front legs that blocks all damage that comes from the front and cannot be broken by any means. Its core is protected during this move. The Ruin Machine can still move, however, this is limited only to rotation, and the Ruin Machine cannot be forced out of this state by any means.
** '''Shield Bash:''' If attacked within melee range of the shield, sends a blast in front of itself that deals '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|AoE Physical DMG}} and launches the player back. The core is protected during this attack.

* '''Leap:''' Leaping high in the air, the Defender then lands on its target, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|AoE Physical DMG}} around where it lands. During this whole attack, its core is protected. Note that the AoE ring that shows where it will land has a very short duration, as it will land almost instantly upon performing this move, meaning as soon as you see the ring, dash away instantly.

* '''Cannon Shot:''' The Defender charges up energy at its core before firing it, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} on hit. Its core is exposed during this attack.

* '''Deactivated:''' After hitting its exposed core twice the Defender slumps down and becomes deactivated for a short time. During this time it will not attack.

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet both of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
* If multiple abilities meet both conditions, one will be chosen at random.
* Global CD is shared with all nearby [[Ruin Sentinels]].

==Strategy==
The Ruin Defender is by far one of the more annoying Ruin Sentinels as its main ability is to block the player and knock them back. While the Armoured Carapace Array sounds tough, in actuality it only protects anything that comes from the front of it, meaning any attack that deals AoE damage or attacking from behind will still damage the Sentinel. The best way to deal with it while it has its shield up is to attack it from any other direction '''except the front'''.

In [[Spiral Abyss]], these enemies have an enormous health pool. It is recommended to bring freeze comps when dealing with these enemies, as they will tend to frequently put up their shield, making it hard to deal consistent DPS with many other team comps.

==Trivia==
*Their design is likely inspired by the [[w:c:honkai-impact-3rd-archives:Honkai Beast#Crustacean|PSY: Crab]] from ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}''.
