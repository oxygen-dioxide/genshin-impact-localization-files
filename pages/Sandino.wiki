==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sandino:''' Looks like I'm not catching anything today either.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I was in a hurry...
::'''Sandino:''' Huh? Why are you apologizing?
::'''Sandino:''' Ah, you misunderstand. I'm not blaming you for scaring the fish away, sorry about that.
::'''Sandino:''' It's my grandchild who's always running around the place &mdash; neither fish nor birds will stick around upon seeing him.
::'''Sandino:''' I'm used to it, though. I love fishing for it requires patience and allows for quiet consideration &mdash; the fish not being around is unimportant.
::'''Sandino:''' [[Cava]]'s parents don't really accompany him at all, so the fact that he can play by himself is already quite a relief.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You seem like a patient person.
:::'''Sandino:''' Hehe, with my age, there is nothing I need to do right away.
:::'''Sandino:''' Now, would you like to stay for a meal? Although I didn't catch the fish myself, the taste is guaranteed to be good.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Delicious Poisson Seafood Soup|20|x=3}})
;(Available after completing ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the flood...
::'''Sandino:''' That was almost the worst of disasters that could've befallen a small town like our Poisson... It's a miracle that the town has been restored to such an extent.
::'''Sandino:''' Seeing Ms. [[Navia]] face such an ordeal at her tender age really broke our hearts...
::'''Sandino:''' She even mentioned preparing compensation. But why would a natural disaster be the [[Spina di Rosula]]'s fault?
::'''Sandino:''' I'm ashamed to say that at my age, just keeping myself from being a burden is difficult enough, let alone helping.
::'''Sandino:''' I have the Spina and Ms. [[Archenoul]] to thank. My grandkid and I wouldn't have been so lucky if she hadn't been nearby.
:{{DIcon}} I shan't bother you further, then.
::'''Sandino:''' No worries. It's alright. Take care now, the ground's quite slippery.
