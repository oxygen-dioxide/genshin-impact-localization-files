==Description==
"People come and go in such haste, like dreams that stay in the night and leave in the morning."

This simple and ordinary life...<br>
Yes, I think I've lived it to the full.

I was once the [[Kitsune Saiguu|Hakushin Kitsune]].<br>
With my agile and loveable comrades,<br>
I dashed across the mountains and plains of Narukami.

Hopefully, when everything is over,<br>
They can run happily once more...

I once met an [[Chiyo|oni maiden]] with a face as lovely as the moon.<br>
Together, we performed and played divine music before the throne,<br>
And I could not help but applaud her sword dance.<br>
I hope her beauty, bravery, and bearing,<br>
Shall be praised by people for thousands of years to come.

At the thought of her unrivaled beauty,<br>
I cannot help wanting to hide my current appearance with a mask...

I once got into a race with the [[Reizenbou|chieftain]] of the [[Yougou Tengu]],<br>
And we sprinted through all the courses and paths of the spirit mountains, both within it and around it.<br>
In this great contest of speed and strength,

I, born of the [[Hakushin Clan]], was the eventual victor.<br>
Now that I think about it, she must have let me off easy.<br>
The very thought of it makes me feel a little unsatisfied...

I once schemed against a [[Ioroi|bake-danuki]] who persistently challenged me,<br>
And I made him surrender to the [[Ei|Shogun]] completely.<br>
I also shamelessly schemed against the Shogun,<br>
And I made her put the great [[bake-danuki]] under her command.

That night, the moonlight swept the [[Tenshukaku|imperial garden]], through branch and petal,<br>
Showering the courtyard with pearls from heaven.<br>
That scene still glows brightly in my shallow heart...

I hope [[Ei|she]] can remember the wordy motto I dared to put to her ere we parted.<br>
"[[Yougou Cleansing|Do not be blinded. Do not waver. Keep walking on the path you believe in]]."<br>
I hope that my words will ward off at least some of the lies and evil she will face.<br>
I also hope that that [[Ioroi|mischievous yet innocent tanuki]] will not hate me for my final deception...

Now, in this [[The Abyss|darkest of places]],<br>
I will hold tightly to these scenes,<br>
And like the moon shining through the clouds,<br>
They will light up my tiny, fragile heart.

In this life, I once took the form of a human,<br>
And I walked with these short-lived yet beautiful little creatures,<br>
And became friends with many people from all walks of life.<br>
Whether it was the [[Asase Hibiki|shrine maiden]] who came to train in Narukami for the sake of her hometown shrine,<br>
Or the [[Retracing Bolide|kid who got separated from the adults]] by the divine palanquin's entourage during the summer festival,<br>
Or the [[Kamuna Harunosuke|easygoing young man who finally went to Liyue]] to practice the adepti arts...<br>
Whether it's the [[Hiiragi Hiroshi|Kanjou]] who worked hard to make the city prosperous,<br>
Or the [[Mikoshi Nagamasa|craftsman]] who was obsessed with making extremely sharp swords,<br>
Or the [[Naganohara Family|clan who used ingenious techniques]] to make man-made meteors bloom in the skies...<br>
All of them are friends whom I did not expect to make.

I hope the barrier that guards them will not be eroded by any darkness...

Everything, all of this &mdash; they are all things that I yearn for.

"So then, the dark will that gnaws at me..."<br>
"Now that I've lost all my strength,"<br>
"My Hakushin blood is yours to do with as you will."<br>
"However, despite being greatly humbled as I am,"<br>
"I still pray that you will listen to my pleas..."

"If you can see everything that I treasure,"<br>
"Then I beg pardon on behalf of those beings."<br>
"If you would permit me to make but one wish,"<br>
"[[Hanachirusato|Please return my ever-bright memory]],"<br>
"To this land that I love deeply."<br>
"That way, that even after your rampage,"<br>
"I may still hold out hope for beautiful things to endure..."

==Trivia==
*The weapon may be inspired by the orb {{Lang|{{w|Cintamani|Nyoi Houju}}|sa=चिंतामणि|sa_rm=Cintāmaṇi|sa_tl=Wish-Fulfilling Gem|ja=如意宝珠|ja_tl=As-One-Wishes Jewel|sort=ja,sa}} held by the left hand of Hindu/Buddhist goddess {{w|Dakini}} in the iconography of Japanese Buddhism. She is also known as the Byakusin-Ko'ou or Hakushin-Ko'ou ("White-Dawn Fox-Queen") in Japan and has been equated with the agricultural deity {{w|Inari Ōkami|Inari}} in Shinto, who is commonly depicted as a fox woman in folk tales and popular culture.
