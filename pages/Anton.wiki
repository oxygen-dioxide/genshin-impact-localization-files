==Profile==
Anton is a member of the Ninth Company, originally sent to the Chasm to help deal with a mysterious black sludge in a joint agreement with the [[Liyue Qixing]] to combat the darkness underneath. The mission failed as the device the Fatui used exploded and failed to purify anything. This resulted in the company shattering, with men going missing or dying and Anton was forced to assume command of some soldiers - [[Danila]], [[Radomir]], [[Temur]] and Romanski, the latter eventually dying.

The [[Traveler]], sent to investigate hilichurl activity in the Chasm, found Anton and his remaining men. Anton begged for food which the Traveler gave them, only for another group to arrive and attack for it. The Traveler drove the unwelcome Fatui away. Anton then explained that all of the Fatui were provisioned from a supply line and asked them to check on his behalf, as the men he had sent never returned. After searching the premises, they found a [[Yanbo's Note|note]] from [[Yanbo]] that explained that the Fatui were no longer welcome in Liyue due to [[Tartaglia|Childe]] unleashing [[Osial]] on its people and brought it to Anton and his men. The four soldiers were surprised by the turn of events outside but accepted the outcome nonetheless. Anton then thanked and rewarded the Traveler, allowing them to ask a few questions before he and the others made a break to the surface.

===Personality===
Anton is a loyal member of the Fatui who tries to address the morale of his men to a somewhat poor extent due to the unusual circumstances they were facing. Nonetheless, he was quick to take help from anyone he saw and valued the lives of the men remaining with him, as he wanted to honor his commander's wishes by ensuring that they didn't die in vain.

===Appearance===
Anton takes on the form of a [[Fatui Skirmisher - Anemoboxer Vanguard]].

==Trivia==
* {{Lang|"Antoha"|ru=Антоха|ru_rm=Antokha}} is a {{w|Eastern Slavic naming customs#Slang forms|slang form}} of the name {{Lang|"Anton"|ru=Антон|ru_rm=Anton}}. Slang forms of Russian names give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the {{w|Eastern Slavic naming customs#Patronymics|patronymic}}-only form of address in the Soviet Union.
*Anton appears to have been good friends with the Millelith soldier [[Yanbo]] at one point, with the latter in charge of supplying rations to the Fatui expedition.

===Etymology===
*Anton's surname, Melnikov, may be inspired by {{w|Andrey Melnikov}}, a member of the real-life 9th Company who perished in the line of duty during the {{w|Battle for Hill 3234}}. He was posthumously awarded the title of {{w|Hero of the Soviet Union}} for his actions.
