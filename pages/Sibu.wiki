==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sibu:''' Hello, need a letter sent? I hope the destination is somewhere I've never been before.
:{{DIcon}} Are you that well-traveled?
::'''Sibu:''' Well, that's all relative.
::'''Sibu:''' Naturally, someone like me who delivers letters all the time has seen a lot more of the world than someone who never gets out.
::'''Sibu:''' But I mainly carry messages from tribe to tribe, so I'm a lot less well-traveled if you compare me to those of my colleagues who've been much further afield.
::'''Sibu:''' I even have a friend who once delivered something near Ochkanatlan!
::'''Sibu:''' It's an ancient city, built by the followers of the first Pyro Archon. The whole area's very dangerous, but we'll deliver there all the same!
::'''Sibu:''' I just hope I'll be lucky enough to pick up a cool commission like that too sometime soon...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I shan't bother you.
::'''Sibu:''' I see, looks like your friends are all still around then.
