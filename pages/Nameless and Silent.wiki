|description    = An exquisite strip table cabinet made from [[Peach Palm Wood]] and lined with an elegantly patterned tablecloth. Can be found in the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. It is said that the Stadium's unique interior has caused these tables to serve as filler for empty spaces or as a complement to some other aesthetic, rather than as the main furniture item. However, it has borne these tasks dutifully, just as those who go unnamed and unsung in [[Natlan]] itself...
