==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Verr Goldet is the boss of Wangshu Inn and the wife of [[Huai'an]]. She allegedly hails from [[Mondstadt]] and moved to Liyue once she got married. However, [[Jiangxue]] notes that nobody from Mondstadt knows her, indicating that she is either using an alias, or may come from another nation.

Both Verr and Huai'an, along with the rest of the Wangshu Inn staff, are agents of the [[Liyue Qixing]] and pass their intel to [[Ningguang]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Equilibrium}}</ref> The two established Wangshu Inn to covertly support [[Xiao]] in his mission to suppress the emanations of evil gods.

==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Wangshu]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Verr Goldet:''' Hello! ...A distinctive but elusive dress sense, defined yet atypical facial features, and followed around everywhere by a [[Paimon|floating elf companion]]. Hmmm... nope. Can't place you.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy something to eat.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' What'll you have? We have dishes from both Mondstadt and Liyue, and our Almond Tofu is particularly popular.
:;(Opens [[Wangshu Inn#Shop|Wangshu Inn Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Verr Goldet:''' My name is Goldet and I come from Mondstadt. I am the boss here at the Wangshu Inn.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' Lest you think I was the boss' wife.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' I'm the boss, with a capital "B-O-S-S."
::{{DIcon}} I've heard the rumors...
:::'''Verr Goldet:''' Hahaha, well I'd hardly be able to operate an inn in this location without connections with the Qixing.
:::'''Verr Goldet:''' What I mean is I obviously need their approval.
:::'''Verr Goldet:''' All that other nonsense is just rumors, though.
:::'''Verr Goldet:''' Speaking of which, have you got any interesting news to share?
::{{DIcon}} Whose is this kitty?
:::'''Verr Goldet:''' *sigh* ...This cat invited itself here... But it's cute, so I let it stay.
:::'''Verr Goldet:''' Its name is Wei. That was quite simply the first name we thought of.
:::'''Verr Goldet:''' You might find Wei causes a bit of mischief &mdash; you know what cats are like. But please refrain from stooping to the same level yourself.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your husband.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' Over there. He's the innkeeper.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' Don't be led astray by the cheeky grin on his face. He is a rather formidable martial artist.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' I also practice martial arts, as do the kitchen staff. It is a hiring requirement.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' You have to have nimble use of your hands and feet when you're serving guests, don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' Safe travels.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Wangshu]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Verr Goldet:''' Hello! Oh! A return customer, welcome back.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy something to eat.
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} Hey boss lady.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' Ugh... how many times do I have to tell you, it's not "boss lady."
::'''Verr Goldet:''' I'm the boss here at Wangshu Inn.
::'''Verr Goldet:''' Not boss lady. Just boss.
::{{DIcon}} I've heard the rumors...
::{{DIcon}} Whose is this [[Wei (Cat)|kitty]]?
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your husband.
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:;(Same as before)
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Unreconciled Stars===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Verr Goldet:''' Hello there! I presume that you've heard about these meteorites sending people to sleep?
:'''Verr Goldet:''' We've set aside quite a number of the guest rooms so that they can be available when victims are brought in. So, space is tight. If you want to make a booking, you should do it as early as you can.
:;(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
{{Dialogue end}}
===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Verr Goldet:''' Hello! Oh! Well, you certainly are a returning customer. Welcome back.
:'''Verr Goldet:''' You've come at a good time: the Moonchase Festival is the best time for viewing the moon and enjoying gourmet food, and Wangshu Inn has plenty of both.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Her name (as hailing from Mondstadt) is a pun on ''{{wt|vergoldet|vergoldet|German}}'' which in German means ''gilded/golden'' or ''gold-plated''.
* When Paimon and the Traveler call her "boss lady," the Chinese term is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=老板娘|zh_rm=lǎobǎnniáng}}, which can also be translated as "boss' wife."
* On the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]], an anonymous messenger asks Verr Goldet out on a date. Huai'an pens a response in Verr's stead.
