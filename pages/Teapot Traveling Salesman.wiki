The '''Teapot Traveling Salesman''' is a subsystem in the [[Serenitea Pot]] accessed by talking to [[Chubby]].

Chubby appears only on [[Serenitea Pot#Visit Times|certain days of the week]], namely Friday, Saturday and Sunday. He will appear randomly in one of four total possible locations each week, one in each area (Chubby will only spawn in the unlocked areas). On Fridays, Chubby's shop will only be open to the player who owns the realm he is in. On Saturdays and Sundays, his shop will open to visitors and players will be able to [[Serenitea Pot#Co-Op Mode|visit their friends' Teapots]] to purchase items from him.

Purchasing items from another player's Traveling Depot is required for Round 4 of the [[Adeptal Mirror]], as well as for a weekly [[Battle Pass]] mission.
