==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Junkichi is a writer at the [[Yae Publishing House]]. He is the author of the novel [[Onibudou]] and his editor is [[Shigeru]].

===Personality===
Junkichi enjoys writing whatever he feels like, much to the chagrin of his editor Shigeru. He loathes writing standards, considering it to be bland and boring. He cites [[Literature Club]] as one of these reasons as the book was popular but eventually died off; in his words, the author did not have a desire to create. While he insists on making his own novel exciting, he does not account for the possible consequences for rushing his own ideas into the story rather than letting it build up over time. As a result, he frequently squabbles with Shigeru over his novel.

*"The ability to stop time..."

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Junkichi:''' ...And at that moment, klang! Time stops!
:'''Shigeru:''' Wait, stop...
:'''Junkichi:''' Exactly! Time stops, and then...
:'''Shigeru:''' No, I mean "stop." I didn't mean "stopping time"...
:'''Junkichi:''' Oh, you don't think a time-stop will do? What about invisibility? That sounds good too.
:'''Shigeru:''' Argh, just listen here, you!
:'''Junkichi:''' Huh?
:'''Shigeru:''' Doesn't this character already have a boatload of super powers? If we add another, it will ruin the whole thing!
:'''Junkichi:''' But...
:'''Shigeru:''' No buts! Think, man, think!
:'''Junkichi:''' Okay, okay... Aaand poof, there goes my inspiration all of a sudden.
:'''Junkichi:''' I mean, come on, my gut tells me that we should give him the ability to stop time right here!
:'''Junkichi:''' Why don't you think this over, instead?
:'''Shigeru:''' Ugh, this is so exhausting...
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Junkichi or Shigeru)
:'''Junkichi:''' Ugh, this deadline... There's no way I'll make it.
:'''Junkichi:''' How about I just do a short story in a parallel universe, just to get something in for the festival, and then we can talk?
:'''Shigeru:''' What? A parallel universe? Will the characters still be the same ones?
:'''Junkichi:''' Well yes... and not entirely, no...
:'''Junkichi:''' I mean, if we create a new world setting, then we don't have to consider the original narrative. We'll be free to innovate! This'll be done in no time!
:'''Shigeru:''' ...Please don't do this. That's no different from the author writing fan fiction for himself!
:'''Shigeru:''' Adding features and plot devices on for this reason will ruin all the content that we've built up so far. It's not worth it!
:'''Junkichi:''' Come on, can't we...? Then I guess we've just got to prepare for the eventuality that I won't finish the manuscript.
