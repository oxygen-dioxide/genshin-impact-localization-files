{{Quote|The Kamisato Clan's housekeeper. A well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Thoma is known by Inazumans to be a "helper" &mdash; helping everyone out and ensuring that any issues are quickly and peacefully resolved.

The son of an Inazuman father and Mondstadter mother, Thoma shares the traits seen in both nations' peoples; his father placed a great emphasis on loyalty, while being raised in Mondstadt meant that he could easily mingle with most people. He believes that people should happily enjoy a leisurely life and does not particularly care about his reputation, even if people speak ill of him. He originally went to Inazuma to bring his father [[Dandelion Wine]], but after falling overboard, he ended up in Inazuma with no connections and no [[Mora]]. Despite the dangers he faced at the time, Thoma was able to make the most of his situation and eventually obtained the [[Kamisato Clan]]'s trust. He is an efficient worker, resolving all of the Kamisato Clan's issues in a timely order.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kujou Sara|About Thoma}}</ref>

He places great loyalty on the Kamisato Clan. Despite his easy-going appearance, he shows no mercy to those who threaten the Kamisato siblings and the [[Yashiro Commission]]. He does not use his connections for personal gains.

Hailing from Mondstadt,<ref>Web Event [[Mysterious Voyage]] Voyage Packet: [[Mysterious Voyage/Story#There are so many fluffy friends.21|There are so many fluffy friends!]]</ref> Thoma is a young man with green eyes and messy blond hair tied in a ponytail by a red cord with tassels fading to tan at the ends.

Thoma's outfit is a fusion of Western-style attire with parts of samurai armor. He wears a decorative, red and black cropped jacket over a black shirt, along with a pair of silver dog tags hanging around his neck. The buttoned cuffs of his gold-trimmed ''kote''-like sleeves are patterned with a ''{{w|fleur-de-lis}}'' design. He wears a black metal headband on his head, with gold-accented horns resembling the ''maedate'' (front crest) of a ''kabuto'' helmet. He wears a [[Pyro]] [[Vision]] on his belt, in addition to a ''kusazuri'' (tassel) adorned with flaming Kamisato Clan crests on the other hip. The same crest is marked on the poleyns of his boot-laced ''suneate'' (shin guards) with ''tabi'' shoes. He also has small, red studded earrings.

{{Quote|What Taroumaru meant was that Thoma is very good at taking care of people and is a very good friend. But you can't just take care of others, you have to take care of yourself too... Wait, what are you laughing at! I was just translating what Taroumaru said!|[[Gorou]]}}

Thoma, who was born in [[Mondstadt]], now lives in [[Inazuma]], where he is the [[Kamisato Clan]]'s housekeeper. He's also a well-known "fixer" in Inazuma.

Perhaps influenced by the relaxed and happy atmosphere of his hometown, Thoma is very good at socializing. Although he is an outlander, he has built an unexpectedly powerful network of people in Inazuma.

He is an affable person by nature and can easily get involved in various topics and establish relationships with various people. When it is time to defend the rights and interests of the Yashiro Commission, he will also put his smile away and show his serious side.

Occasionally, however, Thoma will sit alone in a corner of the [[Yashiro Commission]] and think about matters concerning himself.

He is an attentive, friendly, and sociable person who cares for all animals and comrades, but perhaps he also feels some unspeakable homesickness.

Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.</p><p>This calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.</p><p>Here, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of "repayment" arose.</p><p>Ten years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.</p><p>Kamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:</p><p>"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase.

Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.</p><p>The storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.</p><p>But after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:</p><p>"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady. You will certainly need me as a helper in the path you embark on in the future."</p><p>The will to burn for loyalty and righteousness forged a strong desire that drew the attention of the gods.</p><p>As if to respond to Thoma's choice — on this night of divergent destinies, a Vision, bright red like a blaze, appeared beside him.</p>

=='''Trivia'''==
*Thoma wields the ascended version of the [[Kitain Cross Spear]] in his official art.
*Thoma is the first new male 4* character since the release of the game.

===Etymology===
*Thoma is a variation of the Ancient Greek name {{Lang|Thomas|el=Θωμᾶς|el_rm=Thōmâs}}, which in turn is derived from the Aramaic name תאומא meaning "twin". It also resembles the Japanese name "Tōma", which alludes to Thoma's Inazuman ancestry. This may also be based on the practice of foreigners adopting Japanese legal names upon {{W|Japanese_nationality_law#Naturalization|naturalization}}; which was especially true for {{W|List_of_foreign-born_samurai_in_Japan|foreign-born samurai}} who adopted new names in Japan that resembled those of the natives living there.
*His constellation name, Rubeum Scutum, is Latin for "red shield".
