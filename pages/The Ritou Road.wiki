'''''The Ritou Road''''' is a [[World Quests|World Quest]] in [[Inazuma]] unlocked by completing the [[Archon Quest]] [[Ritou Escape Plan]].

To start this quest, interact with (View) the secret passageway behind the house on the south side of Ritou, where [[Harrison]] usually stands.

Alternatively, the secret passageway in the camp can be interacted with as well.

==Steps==
#Investigate the strange camp
#Hide next to the camp
#Observe Harrison
#Defeat all the slimes
#* {{Enemy|Electro Slime|x=3}}
#* {{Enemy|Large Electro Slime|x=1}}
#* {{Enemy|Mutant Electro Slime|x=1}}
#Talk to Harrison

==Gameplay Notes==
* Interacting with the passageway from either end grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "Hello...! Anyone in here...?"
* After completing Confessions of an Outlander, Harrison cannot be found at his usual location, which is also where this quest begins. He will return after completing this quest.
* After completing this quest, you can interact to (Board) the boat next to the secret camp. Doing so will bring you to [[Araumi]], near the beach. However, it is a one-way trip and there is no method to return from Araumi to Ritou.

{{Dialogue start}}
;(If viewing the passageway behind the house and appearing at the camp)
:'''Paimon:''' We're... on the shore? And there's a camp here.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders what it's here for...

;(If viewing the passageway from the camp and appearing behind the house)
:'''Paimon:''' That camp actually has a passageway {{sic|that}} here. So weird...
:'''Paimon:''' Should we go back to that camp and have a look?
----
;(Interact with an object)
:'''Paimon:''' What's this doing here?
;(Interact with another object)
:'''Paimon:''' Who could've put it there?
;(Interact with the final object)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? S&mdash;Sounds like someone's coming. Quick, we've gotta hide!

;(After hiding, Harrison appears)
:'''Harrison:''' Well, so this stuff's finally arrived.
:'''Harrison:''' Took them long enough...
:'''Harrison:''' Agh, and this box is broken on one side, too!
:'''Harrison:''' Come on! I told him to be careful. Let's just hope nothing inside is broken...
:'''Harrison:''' Phew, looks like none of the bottles broke...
:'''Harrison:''' Eh? Why's this bottle's cap loose? You have to unscrew it first before installing it, come on...
:'''Harrison:''' *cough* And these alcohol-making ingredients have too strong a flavor, let's move them out first...
:'''Harrison:''' Eh? What are all these slimes doing here?

;(Enter battle with the Electro Slimes)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh wait, that's Harrison! Looks like he's been surrounded by slimes...
:'''Harrison:''' Argh! What's... what's with these slimes! It's like they've gone berserk!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, less talking, more helping!
----
;(After defeating the slimes)
:'''Harrison:''' Thank you, Traveler, thank you so much for your help...
:'''Harrison:''' If not for you, this place would have been my grave today...
:{{DIcon}} You set this camp up?
::'''Harrison:''' Um, you could say so.
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to here?
::'''Harrison:''' I'm, ah, moving goods! Moving goods...
:'''Harrison:''' I mean, you know that doing business is hard here on Ritou. This camp is... well, you can consider it a little trick of mine.
:'''Harrison:''' Some days back, I commissioned a... friend to ship me some alcohol-making ingredients from Mondstadt.
:'''Harrison:''' He then got a test batch of new product from the [[Dawn Winery]], which was just shipped here.
:'''Harrison:''' But he hasn't been all that careful, so some of the boxes are broken, and the cap on a bottle of alcohol-making ingredients was loosened.
:'''Harrison:''' I decided to unscrew it so that I could then reinstall it.
:'''Harrison:''' But I never expected that a whole bunch of slimes would come jumping out of the unscrewed cap. What a strange occurrence.
:{{DIcon}} Brewing ingredients from the Dawn Winery, huh...
:'''Harrison:''' Ah, it doesn't matter right now. As for the ingredients, I'll settle with that fellow the next time he comes by.
:'''Harrison:''' You've saved my life, and I owe you something for it. Take these first, then.
:'''Harrison:''' That aside, you see that small boat over there? That's another one of my little tricks.
:'''Harrison:''' Using that boat, you can sneak over to Narukami Island from here. Convenient, huh?
:{{DIcon}} And why would I need to "sneak"...
:'''Harrison:''' Ah, you see, this is what they call "expecting the unexpected."
:'''Harrison:''' Well, I need to go back and take stock of those goods, so I can't stay here long. Once again, thank you so much, Traveler.
:'''Harrison:''' Looks like I'll have to change up my pick-up spot.
