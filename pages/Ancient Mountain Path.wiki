{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Ancient Mountain Path|It|Ancient Mountain Path}} contains the '''Flowfire Experimentation Site''', where ancient [[dragon]] researchers once developed [[Coagulation Pearl|a method]] of converting [[Phlogiston]] from liquid to solid form. The player gains access to this location during the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[How Long Must We Wait, My Friend?]]''</p>}}

====“Phlogiston Converter” Experimental Report====
This interactable is found on the lower floor of the Flowfire Experimentation Site.
{{Readable|title="Phlogiston Converter" Experimental Report|
(The record left in this golden light seems to be a rather ancient experimental report...)<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->Experiment 150: The Type-01 Phlogiston Converter was successful in converting liquid Phlogiston at the experiment site to a solid state.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->The extraction of Phlogiston from the converted solid was attempted. It was discovered that the sample was not solid Phlogiston, but [[Pulverite|another type of rock]]. It appears to be the product of the fusion of "[[gaseous Phlogiston]]" with stones, and frequently occurs during the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|Tollan Volcano]]'s eruptions. While this specimen is noteworthy, it is not regarded to be practical for our current circumstances.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->This unexpected conversion necessitates a comprehensive examination of the Type-01 parameters.<br>
...<br><!--
-->However, time is limited. In order to resist and prevent the descent of those plunderous [[Heavenly Principles|enemies from beyond the sky]], the "State Change" device must be used to convert Phlogiston into more resilient fortifications situated atop Tollan Volcano... Fortifications, yes...<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->Everything... for our nation...}}

====Researcher’s Notes====
This interactable is found on the lower floor of the Flowfire Experimentation Site.
{{Readable|title=Researcher's Notes|
(The record left in this golden light seems to be something left behind by the owner of this place...)<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->The war has started. The research on the "Phlogiston Converter" has been completed. The time I spent here, though brief, was nothing if not nostalgic.<br><!--
-->Lord [[Kukulkan]] ordered us to conduct our experiments on sites situated outside the Sacred Mountain. Perhaps it was to protect the position of dissenters like us.<br><!--
-->But in the face of real danger, all factions should put aside their differences, unite, and fight together... I can only pray that the relationship between Lord Kukulkan and the [[Chamber of Deliberation]] can be mended somehow...<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->There wasn't enough time. We couldn't retrieve most of the materials. We could only return to the Sacred City with our experimental data, but it'll be alright. I'm certain of our victory. When that day arrives, we'll just bring these things back to the Sacred City of Tollan, one by one.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->The "[[Secret Source Servant]]" and the "[[Secret Source Dragon Idol]]"... Well, we've set up periodic defense mechanisms to keep this place safe.<br><!--
-->I'm leaving this place in your capable hands, my trusty constructs.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->They don't come with "true" emotion modules, so why do I feel like they're sad to see me go? Haha... Look at me, projecting my fantasies onto non-living objects. A researcher's greatest folly.<br><!--
-->But it's okay... It's okay, little ones. Just wait for me to return victorious from the war...<br><!--
-->I won't be long. I'll come home soon.}}
