'''Kitsune''' are a kind of [[youkai]] in [[Inazuma]].

==Powers and Abilities==
Kitsune possess mythical abilities such as shapeshifting. It is also implied that they have the ability to transfer their consciousnesses into inanimate objects, as [[Yae Miko]] passed this skill on to [[Ei]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Omnipresent God}}</ref>

==History==
According to [[Toki Alley Tales]], the kitsune came to the archipelago of [[Inazuma]] from mainland Teyvat, fighting a war against the island's native [[tanuki]] for the land. Although the war is claimed to have ended in a draw, the tanuki had to cede the [[Sacred Sakura]] and [[Mt. Yougou]] to the kitsune.

A prominent kitsune clan was the [[Hakushin Clan]], named after its matriarch [[Hakushin]]. She dwelt on Mt. Yougou and had six apprentices, the eldest of whom was the troublemaking "Black Fox" Itaru.<ref>{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|2}}</ref> The [[Kitsune Saiguu]], who was worshipped as a kitsune goddess, was a member of the Hakushin Clan. She was [[Ei]]'s companion for a time, up until she was absorbed and killed by the dark forces during the [[cataclysm]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring}}</ref> The unsullied parts of her memories coalesced into [[Hanachirusato]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Yougou Cleansing}}</ref>

==Classification==
According to Yae Miko, the kitsunes are divided in grades, the highest being the Sky Kitsunes (such as herself), while two grades lower than them there are the Yakan kitsunes.<ref>{{Ref/Talent|Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura}}</ref>
