==Gameplay Notes==
===Inactivity Kick===
Reminiscent Regimen: Thrill was the first event in which players could be automatically kicked from a match due to inactivity. If a player's character is not moved for 30 seconds, the following notice will appear on the screen:
:You will be removed from the challenge if you are idle for too long.
:Time remaining{{Colon}}
:00{{Colon}}15
:Move your character to close the prompt and return to the challenge
If the 15-second timer reaches 00:00, the player is removed from the match and does not receive any rewards.

* Performing actions that do not move the character, including combat [[Talents]], will count as being "idle."
* Being staggered will count as moving the character, even if the character is otherwise idle.
