==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Xu works for the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]], primarily under [[Xingqiu]].

When the guild acquired the [[Kamera]], Xu helped out in test trials to see if it would sell well in the city. However, demand was greater than he expected and with his master missing, he tasked the [[Traveler]] to give the photos to [[Tea Master Liu Su]] and [[Granny Shan]]. After the Traveler gave the photos to them, Xu rewarded them with the [[Kamera]].

===Personality===
Xu is a loyal servant of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. He calls Xingqiu "Master". He is constantly frustrated with Xingqiu's constant disappearances and lack of devotion to the guild's success, not being able to connect the fact that Xingqiu has been contributing to the guild's growth over several years.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Xu:''' Just where has he gone wandering off to this time? Honestly...
:'''Xu:''' Oh, my apologies. How may the Feiyun Commerce Guild be of assistance to you, good sirs?
:{{DIcon}} Sirs...?
::'''Xu:''' Yes, I'm referring to you. The vast majority of visitors here are in big business, so I've become accustomed to speaking politely.
::'''Xu:''' What's more, the master here has made it clear, if you want to be in business, you be polite to everyone.
::'''Xu:''' If you treat people by their appearances, one day you're going to offend someone very important.
::'''Xu:''' Call it a business principle of the Feiyun Commerce Guild if you will.
:{{DIcon}} Master?
::'''Xu:''' The master I just referred to?
::'''Xu:''' A lot of our business is left up to him, including our most important silk trade.
::'''Xu:''' As incredibly gifted as he may be in the art of business, his heart isn't in it. He has a habit of suddenly disappearing.
::'''Xu:''' What's even more impressive is the fact that this hasn't affected business in the slightest. Conversely, business over the last few years has only become better and better.
::'''Xu:''' Even if you do manage to catch him, there's nothing to really accost him for anyway so...
::'''Xu:''' *sigh* I can't make sense of it...
:{{DIcon}} We need to get going.
::'''Xu:''' Take care. If you have anymore business to attend to, remember us here at Feiyun Commerce Guild, won't you?

===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Xu:''' I've heard that Master's taken on quite a fair bit of work this Lantern Rite. It should be going smoothly, of course.
:'''Xu:''' Still, there's neither hide nor hair of him, as always...
:'''Xu:''' Oh, my apologies. How may the Feiyun Commerce Guild be of assistance to you, good sirs?
