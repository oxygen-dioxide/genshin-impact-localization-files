==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Xu works for the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]], primarily under [[Xingqiu]].

When the guild acquired the [[Kamera]], Xu helped out in test trials to see if it would sell well in the city. However, demand was greater than he expected and with his master missing, he tasked the [[Traveler]] to give the photos to [[Tea Master Liu Su]] and [[Granny Shan]]. After the Traveler gave the photos to them, Xu rewarded them with the [[Kamera]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xu:''' Just where has our Master gone wandering off to this time? Honestly...
:'''Xu:''' Oh, my apologies. How may the Feiyun Commerce Guild be of assistance to you, good sirs?
:{{DIcon}} Sirs...?
::'''Xu:''' Yes, I'm referring to you. The vast majority of visitors here are in big business, so I've become accustomed to speaking politely.
::'''Xu:''' What's more, the master here has made it clear, if you want to be in business, you be polite to everyone.
::'''Xu:''' If you treat people by their appearances, one day you're going to offend someone very important.
::'''Xu:''' Call it a business principle of the Feiyun Commerce Guild if you will.
:{{DIcon}} Master?
::'''Xu:''' The master I just referred to?
::'''Xu:''' A lot of our business is left up to him, including our most important silk trade.
::'''Xu:''' As incredibly gifted as he may be in the art of business, his heart isn't in it. He has a habit of suddenly disappearing.
::'''Xu:''' What's even more impressive is the fact that this hasn't affected business in the slightest. Conversely, business over the last few years has only become better and better.
::'''Xu:''' Even if you do manage to catch him, there's nothing to really accost him for anyway so...
::'''Xu:''' *sigh* I can't make sense of it...
:{{DIcon}} We need to get going.
::'''Xu:''' Take care. If you have anymore business to attend to, remember us here at Feiyun Commerce Guild, won't you?
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xu:''' I've heard that Master's taken on quite a fair bit of work this Lantern Rite. It should be going smoothly, of course.
:'''Xu:''' Still, there's neither hide nor hair of him, as always...
:'''Xu:''' Oh, my apologies. How may the Feiyun Commerce Guild be of assistance to you, good sirs?
