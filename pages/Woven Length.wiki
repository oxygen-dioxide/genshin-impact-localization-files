|description    = A horizontal loom built into a wooden cart that had adopted a rather traditional design. It is used to weave fabric in larger sizes and has served as the cornerstone in [[Sumeru]]'s textile industry for over 100 years. It is often used with a vertical loom to make up for its shortcomings in fabricating intricate patterns.<br>Though this machine is not yet perfect, its fundamental design is still one of the [[Kshahrewar]] school's vaunted research results and has spurred inspiration across disciplines &mdash; an architecture researcher once gazed at this loom while purchasing a custom-made carpet, saying "If we set up facilities to manufacture and deliver materials first, such that we can 'weave' a house as if weaving a fabric..." Well, of course, none know if the researcher ever put this concept into practice.
