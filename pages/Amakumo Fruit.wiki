==Descriptions==
{{Description|The fruit of the Amakumo Grass, which grows on Seirai Island. You can hear it crackling with a tiny current if you hold it up to your ear.<br />The Amakumo Grass was born when the terrible slaughter that tore through Seirai Island, causing it to ever be under a stormy shroud, ended. As if showing its defiance, it will bear fruit while facing the peals of thunder from the sky.<br />This bold spirit also accompanied those who emigrated to Seirai Island, until [[Koseki Village]] was at last ruined and no clergy-person was left to man the [[Asase Shrine]].}}
