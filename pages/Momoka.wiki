{{Lang|'''Momoka'''|ja=百華|ja_rm=Momoka}} was a ninja of the [[Shuumatsuban]]. While her fate is unknown, [[Momoyo]] believes she was killed by the [[Fatui]].

==Profile==
Momoka used to communicate with her colleague Momoyo through various means, one of which consisting of Momoyo posing as a shrine maiden at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] and handing out [[Strange Fortune Slip]]s containing mission orders to the ninjas who recited their secret code while exchanging a [[Bamboo Slip]].

Upon her defeat in a Fatui camp in [[Araumi]], she left behind Tattered Notes containing her secret code, "In the middle of a hazy night," hoping that the Fatui would notice it and attempt to use it to infiltrate the Shuumatsuban. The Fatui spies who would try this, unknowing that each ninja had their own code, would therefore immediately get recognized by the Shuumatsuban.

However, things did not go as planned, as the [[Traveler]] defeated the Fatui at the camp themselves, found her Tattered Notes, and attempted to use the code, confusing Momoyo and resulting in the events of ''[[Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips]]''.

It is revealed at the end of ''[[Where the Dandelions Find Rest]]'' that when Momoyo was an orphan, Momoka was the one who took her in and allowed her to become a member of the Shuumatsuban.
