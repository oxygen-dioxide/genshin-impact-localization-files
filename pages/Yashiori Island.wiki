Under the influence of the Tatarigami, Yashiori Island has been deserted by its inhabitants. What can be seen on the island are just endless rain and thunderstorms trying to wash away the remnants of the past.

{{Description|The skeleton of [[Orobashi|a great snake]] rests on this island. The presence of evil is palpable here.|Version 1.5 Special Program}}

==Lore==
After [[Makoto]] and her twin sister [[Ei]] united Inazuma under their rule, none of the remaining gods sought to claim any territory that was not theirs lest they be eradicated by the Archon. Orobashi no Mikoto, known as the Watatsumi Omikami, was one such god. However, for unknown reasons, it suddenly came into conflict with the Shogunate. Orobashi and Ei fought at Yashiori Island, where she slew it using the [[Musou no Hitotachi]] and split the island into two, creating the [[Musoujin Gorge]]. Orobashi's lingering hatred turned into the [[Tatarigami]], which she suppressed using her wards. The people of Watatsumi Island begrudgingly accepted Baal's rule afterwards, although they continue to worship Orobashi even in the present.

Along with the wards, the Kitain Clan, descended from [[Kitain Bunsou]], took the mantle of the Yashiori Guardians who suppressed the Tatarigami. However, the Kitain bloodline came to an end due to [[Kitain Hideie]]'s escape during the [[cataclysm]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Absolution-Seeker's Testament}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Orobashi's Legacy: Part V}}</ref>

With the implementation of the [[Sakoku Decree]] and [[Vision Hunt Decree]], tensions between the [[Shogunate]] and the people of Watatsumi escalated into war as the [[Sangonomiya Resistance]] formed to openly resist the Shogun's rule. A radical group within the Resistance, without their leader [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s knowledge or permission, disguised themselves as Shogunate troops to get close to Baal's wards and destroyed them. They believed this would restore Orobashi's "dignity,"<ref>Interactable: [[Narukami Pillar#Waterlogged Note|Waterlogged Note]]</ref> but all it served to do was unleash the Tatarigami upon the island. Whether they were aware of this would happen or not is currently unclear.

Without the wards to keep them at bay, the Tatarigami began wreaking havoc on the island. The people of [[Higi Village]] began succumbing to mysterious illnesses and madness, leaving the village abandoned by the time the [[Traveler]] explores the area. Shogunate troops stationed in the area were also badly affected, causing General [[Kujou Masahito]] to send a report to his father, [[Tenryou Commission]]er [[Kujou Takayuki]], about the Tatarigami disturbance. Takayuki was furious over what he perceived to be Masahito's incompetence and dispatched an investigation team to report the "truth." Based on the findings of this investigation team, Takayuki was going to consider demoting Masahito and assigning [[Kujou Sara]] to the area instead.

Over the course of the [[Lost Texts]] found throughout Yashiori Island, the investigation team discovered that Masahito was neither lying nor exaggerating about the effects of the Tatarigami. They began succumbing to the Tatarigami influence and the entire group is now presumed dead or missing.
