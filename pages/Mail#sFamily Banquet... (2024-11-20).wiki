|text      = In previous years, my enthusiastic relatives often arranged grand celebrations for my birthday. If I ever hinted at declining, they would be quick to say the reservations had long been made, and it would be too troublesome to change.

This year, I no longer wish for them to go to such lengths on my behalf. I've decided on a different approach: I can prepare the meal myself and invite everyone to a gathering at my home.

I've carefully planned out all the details, such as when to shop for which ingredients as well as in what order to prepare each dish. I've created a meticulous list to ensure everything about this family banquet is in place.

However, turning ideas into reality came with its own unforeseen challenges. Though I had accounted for some extra portions to prevent any shortfall during the process, I ended up making far more than anticipated.

So... Would you mind helping yourself to more food?
