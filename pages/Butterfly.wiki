'''Butterfly''' is a [[Northland Cat]] owned by [[Margaret]].

In the Event [[World Quest]] ''[[Those Hard-to-Reach Places]]'', the traveler finds the cat on top of the city walls while cleaning the floral debris, and then returns her to her owner.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Those Hard-to-Reach Places}}</ref>

==Profile==
Butterfly loves flowers, and enjoys chasing them when they get blown by the wind. Because of this, she has been a burden to Margaret during the [[Windblume Festival]], when floral debris gets scattered all over [[City of Mondstadt|Mondstadt]]'s rooftops.
