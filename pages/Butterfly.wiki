{{Description|Flying insects with large, brightly-colored wings that are drawn to flowers.<br />Their wings release a fine powder when touched that shimmers a little. Butterfly wings have special properties that help with withstanding more extreme conditions when processed into potions. It seems that once the wings have been harvested, they will turn bright blue even if they were yellow before.
