;Available before talking to [[Titu]] in [[Beneath the Crystal Rock]]
:'''Yukom:''' *sigh* How come he's not back yet? How much longer am I gonna have to wait... Uh, did something happen to him?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Yukom:''' Haha, me? You're a curious guest. Call me Yukom. As you can see, I'm a guard at this sentry post &mdash; one of them, anyway.
::'''Yukom:''' But word to the wise, {{MC|m=brother|f=sister}} &mdash; you probably shouldn't just walk up to and talk to someone in the wilds here like that...
::'''Yukom:''' This is the outer edge of the [[Children of Echoes]]' lands. Once you leave this area, you'll enter territory where any warrior's fair game to spar.
::{{DIcon}} Is something the matter?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here, exactly?
::'''Yukom:''' Oh, you know, guarding, standing... waiting.
::'''Yukom:''' Alright, so I'm a little bored, and a bit tired, too. This is the Children of Echoes' sentry post, which people take turns to stand guard over every day.
::'''Yukom:''' This is my "duty" within the tribe.
::{{DIcon}} Is something the matter?
:'''Yukom:''' Nothing major, no worries. It's just... I've a friend, [[Titu]]'s his name. He was supposed to have taken the next guard shift at this post.
:'''Yukom:''' A couple of days back, he said he was going to check on the [[Shadow Pins]] &mdash; you know, the big stone pillars... Either way, he hasn't returned yet.
:'''Yukom:''' He's always been like this, and I'm used to it. If I could just leave this post, I'd be on him like a hawk-eyed hunter before he'd know it... But unfortunately, I can't leave.
:'''Yukom:''' If you run into him, tell him that I'll have to sleep standing up here if he doesn't show up soon.

;Available after completing [[Peace to the Slumbering]]
:'''Yukom:''' *sigh* I didn't expect this round of guard duty to last that long. Well, Titu's finally back, at least...
:{{DIcon}} Hey there! Who are you?
::'''Yukom:''' Haha, me? You're a curious guest. Call me Yukom. As you can see, I'm a guard at this sentry post &mdash; one of them, anyway.

::'''Yukom:''' This is my "duty" within the tribe.
:{{DIcon}} Titu's back. Not gonna take a break?
::'''Yukom:''' What does it look like I'm doing, eh? And now that he is, I no longer need to stare at those ominous winds, strange mutterings, and twisting shadows.
::'''Yukom:''' Just need to watch others work &mdash; that's the best kinda rest, {{MC|m=brother|f=sister}}!
:{{DIcon}} See you!
::'''Yukom:''' Aye, see you. Take care!
