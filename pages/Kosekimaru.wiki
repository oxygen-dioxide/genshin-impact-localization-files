'''Kosekimaru''', also known as '''Miitoboru''' before his real name was revealed, is an event-exclusive [[NPC]] that appeared in [[Summertime Odyssey]].

It appears that when the player uses [[Waverider]]s in [[Golden Apple Archipelago]], they are sailing Kosekimaru.
==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
Kosekimaru hails from [[Seirai Island]] and once sailed as part of [[Ako Domeki]]'s fleet during his rebellion against the [[Shogunate]]. He was never able to communicate with his sailors.

Kosekimaru ended up on the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] during a battle with a Shogunate vessel at Seirai Island when Ako Domeki had seized a [[Maguu Kenki]] on board after being struck by lightning from the [[Thunder Manifestation]], and all of his sailors have drifted back to land. A part of Kosekimaru's remains was crafted by the local children into a sword made in the likeness of the Maguu Kenki's, while the rest of the wreck was stationed at the island between Twinning and Pudding Isle where a xylophone was also created from his remains.

Eventually, a group of [[Fatui]] would travel to the Golden Apple Archipelago and activate a dream-manipulating machine, resurrecting Kosekimaru in the form of a [[Waverider]] and granting him sapience. The [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], [[Fischl]], [[Mona]], [[Xinyan]], and [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] encounter Kosekimaru and are able to talk to him after spending one day on the archipelago. As he originally could not remember his name, Paimon names him "Miitoboru," taking his Inazuman origins into consideration.

Days after, the effects of the Fatui's machine on the island have started to fade. During this time, Miitoboru remembers his past and the name given to him by [[Asase Hibiki]], "Kosekimaru" from the [[Koseki Village]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Final Treasure}}</ref>

===Appearance===
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 2 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Kosekimaru's appearance in the Golden Apple Archipelago is of the standard [[Waverider]] appearance. His window panels light up with blue when he speaks.

The design of Kosekimaru's (and all Waverider's) bow is based on the [[Thunder Manifestation]].

==Trivia==
* ''Miitoboru'' is the romanized transliteration of the English word "meatball" into Japanese.
* One way of saying "meatball" in Japanese ends in {{ja|丸|rm=maru}}, which is a common Japanese suffix for names, including ship names. (Paimon's observation in English that Inazuman ships end in ''-ru'' is incomplete.)
** Similarly, the word "meatball" in Chinese ends with the same character seen in the other ''-maru'' names.
** In Teyvat, the suffix can be found in the names of Kosekimaru himself, [["Seiraimaru"]] (the only other known named Inazuman ship), [[Masagomaru]], [[Takamine the Mistsplitter|Konbumaru]], and [[Akuoumaru]].
