'''Adapt With Ease''' is [[Yelan]]'s [[4th Ascension Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Damage bonus gained by this passive has the following attributes:
** Is calculated based on the duration of [[Depth-Clarion Dice]] and will remain at its stacked value even when swapping active characters.
** Is additive with other DMG% bonuses.
** Is a [[Snapshotting#Buffs|direct buff]], therefore cannot be snapshotted, but also will apply to abilities that have already snapshotted.
