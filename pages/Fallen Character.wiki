'''Fallen Characters''' are characters who have been incapacitated due to their [[Health]] dropping to zero (death), due to drowning, or due to falling out of bounds.

Dead characters can be revived with certain [[:Category:Revive Dishes|Dishes]], by certain [[:Category:Revival Constellations|Constellations]], or by visiting a [[Statue of The Seven]]. They cannot be sent on [[Expeditions]] or added to a new [[party]] they are not already in. After dying, they lose all their [[Energy]].

==Types==
===Death===
'''Death''' is a combat and exploration mechanic related to [[Health]] and is one of the two ways that falling can occur.

Death is normally triggered because the incoming [[Damage]] or [[HP Loss]] exceeds the current character's or enemy's HP, and there are no active [[Status]]es, [[Talent]]s, [[Constellation]]s, or other special conditions that would prevent the character or enemy from normally dying.

====Triggering Character Death====
Enemies generally trigger character death by causing more [[Damage]] or [[HP Loss]] than the character currently has. However, some character Talents and Constellations have the effect of negating death altogether.

Other ways that character death is commonly triggered include:
* [[Fall Damage]]
* [[Climate]] Effects
* Damage from environmental hazards such as [[Obstacle]]s

====Effects of Characters Dying====
During a character death, the relevant [[Fallen Character/Voice-Overs|fallen character voice-over]] and animation is rendered. The character's energy is reset to zero, the character will not be able to move, the player cannot switch to another character, and, depending on the character, their associated Combat and Passive Talent and Constellation effects will end.

Dead characters are unable to be deployed in new [[Party|Parties]], unable to be dispatched on [[Expedition]]s, and unable to be switched in during combat or exploration until [[revive]]d.

Dead characters may or may not continue to provide [[Combat Talent|Combat]] or [[Passive Talent|Passive]] [[Talent]]s until they are revived. Some Talents and Constellations end when their associated characters die, while others will continue.

When character death is triggered but not detected by the client before the character is switched out, the fallen animation can be entirely skipped, but the character nonetheless cannot be switched back in until revived.

=====Effects Triggered on Death=====
Certain passives, such as talents or constellations, trigger when a party member dies (or would otherwise die). Some apply to the current character with the passive, while others apply to other party members except the current character. This does not apply to death that follows drowning or falling out of bounds.

=====Achievements=====
{{Achievement Topic Table|topic=Fallen Characters}}

====Triggering Enemy Death====
Generally, enemy death is triggered when their HP reaches zero. However, the conditions for triggering death can differ based on the enemy.

* [[Azhdaha]], while buried in the ground, cannot be killed and will require one more hit to kill upon resurfacing.
* [[Abyss Herald]]s and [[Abyss Lector]]s die after their shield is completely destroyed.
* The [[Rimebiter Bathysmal Vishap]] and [[Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap]] in the [[Coral Defenders]] challenge will not die until both enemies' HPs reach zero.
* The various [[Hypostases]] (except for the [[Pyro Hypostasis]]) require destroying the various constructs they make at critical HP before they are defeated or can be killed. Even if their HP drops to zero because of incoming attacks that happen before the critical HP/revival stage, they will not die.

====Effects of Enemies Dying====
Some enemies have their own voice-over and animation which is triggered upon death. Others only make specific sound effects when killed. Irregardless, the behavior of enemy death is the same, but their triggers may be different:
* The enemy's hitbox disappears, and [[Talent#Using_Talents|Talents]] cannot select them.
* Any enemy effects which trigger on death (such as an ignited [[Pyro Slime]] or [[Specter]] explosion) occurs.
* The enemy is removed from the scene.
* If the drop limit for that enemy group is not reached, the enemy will provide an assortment of materials.
* Enemies in combat may be alerted to the death of one of their comrades. For example, when one [[Kairagi]] or [[Ochimusha]] is killed, the others in battle will revive and enter a stronger state.

Some enemy attacks and constructs continue to persist even after their associated enemy dies. This includes the [[Anemo Samachurl]]'s Triple Tornadoes and the [[Large Cryo Slime]]'s Regeneration mist. Others will be removed, including the Slimes dug up by the [[Hilichurl Grenadier]] or the Geo constructs created by the [[Geo Samachurl]].

===Out of Bounds and Drowning===
Going '''[[Out of Bounds]]''' and '''[[Drowning]]''' causes all characters in the party to fall. This, however, does not trigger the death of the active character. Instead, all characters' energy is reset to zero, the character is respawned where their stamina was last at maximum, and all characters lose 10% of their current HP.

If, after the penalty is applied, a character reaches zero HP, they will die and remain fallen until revived.

When drowning is triggered but not detected by the client, the fallen animation and voice-over may be played instead if the character is on land.

Enemies will not be revived upon their body entering the water surface. Instead, they will immediately die, and their drops will spawn on top of where they were.
