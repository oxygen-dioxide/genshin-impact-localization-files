:'''Alof:''' Are you here to try out our training?
:{{DIcon}} No time like the present!
::'''Alof:''' Such commendable courage! Excellent. Please, then, step into the Domain.
:{{DIcon}} About the "Owl Musician"...
::'''Alof:''' Ah, interested in this story as well? Allow me to give you a quick summary, then.
::'''Alof:''' This story tells of a kingdom locked in battle against strange monsters.
::'''Alof:''' ...Do forgive me for skipping over most of the combat abilities, magical effects, and so on.
::'''Alof:''' The first third of the story is all about describing the special abilities of each guard in some detail... which, come to think of it, is probably why it was so popular among the troops.
::'''Alof:''' In the second half, the monsters use their last resort, corroding the kingdom using a "dark night," before attacking through that darkness.
::'''Alof:''' The guards were forced back to their final bastion &mdash; the palace interior. But the world outside was being eroded by the devouring darkness. Even the palace lamps were gradually extinguished.
::'''Alof:''' As the final light went out, everyone readied themselves for the final battle, resolving to fight to the end, come what may.
::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
:::'''Alof:''' Suddenly, the sound of flapping wings soared through the palace, and a flight of owls swooped in through a window.
:::'''Alof:''' They were the friends of the palace musician, and when the monsters invaded, the musician knew that the palace would become a battleground, and so had sent those owls away to the forest &mdash; and now, they had returned.
:::'''Alof:''' These warriors, who could see through the darkness, circled throughout the palace, using their hoots to alert the musician to the places where enemies lurked.
:::'''Alof:''' The musician sat before their organ, a grand instrument that had played during countless balls, and which was powerful enough to send its music through to every last corner of the palace.
:::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
::::'''Alof:''' The palace soldiers lifted up their hearts and swords amidst the great swell of the organ, for they now knew where they should swing.
::::'''Alof:''' The musician played, pausing periodically to hearken to the owls' observations, while the soldiers would form defensive formations during those brief pauses.
::::'''Alof:''' Thus were the monsters repelled as the warriors used the palace as their fortress, driving them out through the darkness under the guidance of the owls and the musician.
::::'''Alof:''' At last, peace was restored to the palace, and the music that guided the warriors into battle became widespread... And that's how the story ends.
:::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
:{{DIcon}} Not right now...
::'''Alof:''' That's fine. Come back whenever you have the time &mdash; I will be standing guard here.
