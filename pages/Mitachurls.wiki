{{Description|The most formidable warriors of the Hilichurl tribes.<br />Fighting and eating meat are the two most important things to Hilichurls, because those are what make them grow stronger. All young Hilichurls dream of growing up to become a big and strong Mitachurl, because that way they can eat more meat, and fight more battles.}}
'''Mitachurls''' are larger Hilichurls that have significantly more health and damage than normal [[Hilichurl]] fighters.

Most Mitachurl attacks cause heavy [[Displacement|knockback]]. All Mitachurls will grab [[Slimes]] of varying type from the ground and toss it at the player if they're out of range or on a higher ground.

==Types==
===Axe Mitachurls===
These Mitachurls are armed with an axe which they use to inflict {{Color|Physical DMG}} normally, but can deal {{Color|Elemental DMG}} by slamming a slime into their axe to [[Elemental Infusion|infuse]] it.

===Shield Mitachurls===
These Mitachurls are armed with a massive shield which protects them from frontal attacks much like [[Hilichurl Guards]], although their larger size makes them harder to stagger through brute force. They also use these shields to directly attack players, dealing {{Color|Physical DMG}}. The shields' durability can be lowered by attacks, although depending on the shield the Mitachurl uses in question, some attacks are more effective than others. When the shield is destroyed, the Mitachurl will resort to punches and charge attacks.
