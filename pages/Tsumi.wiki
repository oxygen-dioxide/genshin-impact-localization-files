==Profile==
According to the ancient documents stored in [[Watatsumi Island]], Tsumi is assumed to be a last descendant of the [[Vassals of Watatsumi]], a half-snake, half-human race that are familiars of the god [[Orobashi]]. Over time, the Vassals of Watatsumi became more human-like, the only thing that would distinguish them was their vertical pupils. They were capable of communicating between humans and the reptiles such as serpents, [[vishaps]], etc. But according to the experimental records that [[Enjou]] found in [[Enkanomiya]], along with the ancient legends from this place, Tsumi is assumed to be a [[Reptilian]], part of the highly intelligent and fast-evolving [[Bathysmal Vishaps]] that imitated the human and gradually infiltrated Enkanomiya's high ranking positions. Like the Vassals of Watatsumi, the only thing that distinguishes them are their reptilian pupils, thin and vertical lines.

In her youth, Tsumi was whisked away by the vishaps when they attacked her and her guardian at the borders of Enkanomiya, although for reasons unknown, she was spared and was raised by them. She was aware of the human language by reading leftover books and scrolls, but as the humans of Enkanomiya migrated to Watatsumi Island, there were no longer any humans for her to communicate and practice with.

At some point after the discovery of Enkanomiya, Enjou made an alliance with the Bathysmal Vishaps in which he would bring back the darkness they desired in return for safe passage for the Abyss Order. He did so by rebuilding the Towers of the Void. Doing so brought forth a darkness laced with abyssal energy which the vishaps did not know was poisonous to them, and as such they believed him to have betrayed them. Tsumi, using what she learned from the leftover books and scrolls, was able to protect the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] with a ritual that brought light into the area. She then encountered the [[Watatsumi Army]], who had been sent to investigate and tended to the wounded.

Tsumi later encountered the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], the latter expressing suspicion due to their encounter with [[Hanachirusato]], another masked shrine maiden who was actually an ancient entity. However, with little choice, they chose to work with her and restored the towers to their original forms and defeated Enjou on her behalf. Enjou revealed the truth in which she was a member of the vishap-people (unaware of their proper name) and the Traveler intercepted the [[Coral Defenders]] inside the Dainichi Mikoshi to prevent them from sealing off the [[Bloodbranch Coral]]. After defeating them, the two confronted Tsumi in which she revealed her affiliation to the vishaps and tried to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi to bring darkness back into Enkanomiya. The Traveler gave her two pieces of the pendant which she combined with her own, telling her that she belonged with Watatsumi Island. However, being raised by vishaps, she decided to return to them but chose not to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi, instead warning that the vishaps would be back one day before leaving.

Through two documents that are both incomplete and different at Watatsumi Island and Enkanomiya, there is currently no basis to confirm Tsumi's origin.

===Personality===
Tsumi is an enigmatic character, not much about her true identity has been revealed. She wears a mask to hide her pupils to not scare the others but not incessantly about wearing it as shown when a [[Imaizumi|Sangonomiya Samurai]] pestered her about it, she briefly removed the mask to show her eyes. She is also concerned if the mask makes her untrustworthy in others eyes. She also somewhat a little too honest when talking, directly asked the [[Traveler]] if he/she was human, and admitted that it is lucky that she can read human writing to operate the Sentou Ceremony. Aside from that, Tsumi seems has a kind and gentle personality. She was helping and protecting the wounded [[Watatsumi Army|Sagonomiya Samurais]] before the Traveler arrived. It is later revealed her real affiliation was with the [[Bathysmal Vishaps]] and she concluded the interaction of her kind and humans can only end in betrayal. She wished to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi but was conflicted, openly questioning why she could not bring herself to do it. After the Traveler gave her the missing fragments to complete her pendant and said she belongs to Watasumi Island, Tsumi was greatly confused but only for a moment and made her choice afterwards.

=== Appearance===
Tsumi wears the standard shrine maiden uniform consisting of a white kosode and blue hakama, white socks, and okobo sandals with blue straps. Her outfit contains deep blue accents. She has dark hair cut to chin-length, wears sepia lipstick, and a snake mask to conceal the top half of her face. It is later revealed that the mask is used to hide her reptilian-like pupils.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tsumi:''' How are your efforts to clear the darkness away going?
:{{DIcon}} About the three towers...
::'''Tsumi:''' Each of the towers is positioned on top of a leyline junction, and they are used to maintain balance between vishaps, the Abyss, and humans.
::'''Tsumi:''' After being modified by that person, they are currently enhancing the powers of the Abyss.
:{{DIcon}} About you, Tsumi... <small>''(Unlocks after [[Three Realms Gateway Offering: Part I]] is completed.)''</small>
::'''Tsumi:''' I am of little note.
::'''Tsumi:''' Just one life among many. My present concerns are how to survive... and how to help my brethren.
:{{DIcon}} About the Sentou... <small>''(Unlocks after [[Three Realms Gateway Offering: Part II]] is completed.)''</small>
::'''Tsumi:''' The Sentou ceremony used to be used to chase vishaps away. This is the clash between the human and vishap realms.
::'''Tsumi:''' Once the {{sic|[[Dainichi Mikoshi|Daninichi Mikoshi]]}} was built, the Sentou ceremony was used less and less. However, as a secret art of the human realm, it can certainly still serve as an effective measure against the darkness.
:{{DIcon}} I'm still working on it.
::'''Tsumi:''' I look forward to your success.
