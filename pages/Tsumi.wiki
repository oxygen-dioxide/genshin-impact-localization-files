==Profile==
According to the ancient documents stored in [[Watatsumi Island]], Tsumi is assumed to be a last descendant of the [[Vassals of Watatsumi]], a half-snake, half-human race that are familiars of the god [[Orobashi]]. Over time, the Vassals of Watatsumi became more human-like: the only thing distinguishing them were their vertical pupils. They were capable of communicating between humans and reptiles such as serpents, [[vishaps]], etc. But according to the experimental records that [[Enjou]] found in [[Enkanomiya]], along with the ancient legends from the place, Tsumi is assumed to be a [[Reptilian]], part of the highly intelligent and fast-evolving [[Bathysmal Vishaps]] that imitated humans and gradually infiltrated Enkanomiya's high ranking positions. Like the Vassals of Watatsumi, the only thing that distinguishes them are their reptilian pupils: thin and vertical lines. Through two documents that are both incomplete and different at Watatsumi Island and Enkanomiya, there is currently no basis to confirm Tsumi's origin.

According to [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|Kokomi]], the last Vassal of Watatsumi &mdash; whom she assumed to be Tsumi &mdash; was attacked at the borders of Enkanomiya and was whisked away by the vishaps when she was still an infant. For reasons unknown, she was spared and raised by them. She was aware of human language by reading leftover books and scrolls, but as the humans of Enkanomiya migrated to Watatsumi Island, there were no longer any humans for her to communicate and interact with.

At some point after the discovery of Enkanomiya, [[The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou"|Enjou]] made an alliance with the Bathysmal Vishaps in which he would bring back the darkness they desired in return for safe passage for the [[Abyss Order]]. But Enjou betrayed the vishaps: by rebuilding the Towers of the Void, he brought forth a darkness laced with abyssal energy that the vishaps did not know was poisonous to them. Tsumi, using what she learned from the leftover books and scrolls, was able to protect the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] with the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering/Story|Sentou Ceremony]] that awakened the [[Coral Butterfly|Sangacorexes]] and brought light into the area. She then encountered the [[Watatsumi Army]] who had been sent down to investigate the abnormal darkness and tended to them.

===Appearance===
Tsumi wears the standard shrine maiden uniform consisting of a white kosode and blue hakama, white socks, and okobo sandals with blue straps. Her outfit contains deep blue accents. She has dark hair cut to chin-length, she wears sepia lipstick, and a snake mask to conceal the top half of her face. It is later revealed that the mask is used to hide her vertical reptilian-like pupils.

==Story==
While tending the wounded from Watatsumi Army, Tsumi encountered the Traveler and [[Paimon]]. The three exchanged information about themselves, and Tsumi explained what was then happening in Enkanomiya. She asked for their cooperation to seal off the three towers at the border of Enkanomiya, which were the source of the darkness. When Paimon questioned Tsumi about her mask, Tsumi explained she wore it due to something happening to her face when she was growing up, so she wears the mask as to not scare anyone. The Traveler expressed some suspicion due to their encounter with [[Hanachirusato]], another masked shrine maiden who was actually an ancient entity. Tsumi didn't fully understand what the Traveler said, but also told him she hates betrayals. Tsumi offers her guidance for the Traveler and Paimon if they agree to cooperate and trust her.

The Traveler and Paimon questioned the Watatsumi soldiers tended by Tsumi about what they knew about her. They discovered that the reason Tsumi wore her mask is to hide her reptilian-like pupils and that she could be one of the vassals of Orobashi. After a conference, though still wary of Tsumi but with little choice, they chose to work with her to restore the towers to their original forms and get rid of the darkness. Tsumi then gave the Traveler a [[Bokuso Box|tool]] to effectively fight against the monsters affected by the abyssal energy and explained the ultimate goal of the operation. She also revealed the one responsible for the darkness encroaching Enkanomiya was Enjou.

After restoring the three towers successfully, Tsumi informed the Traveler and Paimon about the abnormal darkness remaining inside the Dainichi Mikoshi, which she assumed to be Enjou's doing, and gave them the his exact location so they can defeat him. Soon after being defeated, Enjou  divulged information about the experiment records of Vishap-people he found in Enkanomiya and said Tsumi was a member of them (unaware of their proper name). He then also revealed Tsumi's actual plan: that she was the one who created the darkness in Dainichi Mikochi and used it as a decoy to lure the Traveler to fight Enjou as a revenge for his betrayal, and to take advantage of the moment to rescue her kin that have been trapped underneath the tower, along with completely shutting down the source of [[Bloodbranch Coral]] so that no more Vishaps will be killed in the future. The Traveler and Paimon quickly returned to the statue beneath Dainichi Mikoshi, but Tsumi was no longer there, so they used Enjou's device to dispel the darkness inside the tower and intercepted the [[Coral Defenders]] to prevent them from sealing off the Bloodbranch Coral in time.

After defeating the vishaps, the two confronted Tsumi after emerging from the Dainichi Mikoshi. Tsumi asked them if her rescue operation had succeeded, in which Paimon interrogated her about her real identity. Tsumi did not disclose any of her information, but revealed her affiliation to the vishaps and her intention to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi to bring darkness back into Enkanomiya. The Traveler attempted to stop her, but she warned them to not come close to her and told them that she can destroy the tower by simply willing it. Despite that, Tsumi somehow couldn't bring herself to destroy the tower. The Traveler then gave her two pieces of the pendant which she combined with her own, telling her that she belonged with Watatsumi Island. However, being raised by vishaps, Tsumi decided to return to them and chose not to destroy the Dainichi Mikoshi, instead warning that the vishaps would be back one day before taking her leave.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tsumi:''' How are your efforts to clear the darkness away going?
:{{DIcon}} About the three towers...
::'''Tsumi:''' Each of the towers is positioned on top of a leyline junction, and they are used to maintain balance between vishaps, the Abyss, and humans.
::'''Tsumi:''' After being modified by that person, they are currently enhancing the powers of the Abyss.
:{{DIcon}} About you, Tsumi... <small>''(Unlocks after [[Three Realms Gateway Offering: Part I]] is completed.)''</small>
::'''Tsumi:''' I am of little note.
::'''Tsumi:''' Just one life among many. My present concerns are how to survive... and how to help my brethren.
:{{DIcon}} About the Sentou... <small>''(Unlocks after [[Three Realms Gateway Offering: Part II]] is completed.)''</small>
::'''Tsumi:''' The Sentou ceremony used to be used to chase vishaps away. This is the clash between the human and vishap realms.
::'''Tsumi:''' Once the {{sic|[[Dainichi Mikoshi|Daninichi Mikoshi]]}} was built, the Sentou ceremony was used less and less. However, as a secret art of the human realm, it can certainly still serve as an effective measure against the darkness.
:{{DIcon}} I'm still working on it.
::'''Tsumi:''' I look forward to your success.
