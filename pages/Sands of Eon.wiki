'''Sands of Eon''', also known colloquially as "'''the clock'''", "'''the hourglass'''", "'''the timepiece'''", "'''the watch'''", or just "'''the sands'''", is an [[Artifact]] Piece in [[Genshin Impact]]. It increases a [[character]]'s stats and has 5 possible main stats: HP%, DEF%, ATK%, [[Elemental Mastery]], or [[Energy Recharge]]. Artifact Pieces can appear in all rarities (1-5 stars).

It is considered to be of medium difficulty to get "good stats" on: harder than the Flower of Life and Plume of Death (which both have set main stats), but easier than the Goblet of Eonothem and Circlet of Logos. Some community-made experiments show the highest probability of main stat are HP% (28%), DEF% (28%), and ATK% (25%), and the lowest probability are Elemental Mastery (10%) and Energy Recharge (9%).
