==Description==
On the cliff facing the eastern sea, the ancestors worshipped the masters of [[Istaroth|Time]] and [[Barbatos|Anemo]] together.<br>
The two are intimately related, as expressed in the saying, "[[Anemo]] brings stories while Time nurtures them."<br>
This sword tells the story of protection to show the courage to protect.<br>
Originally just a prop, its blade was sharpened by the passage of time.

This sword once belonged to the kindly [[Gunnhildr Clan|Gunnhildr clan]]. In sacrificial ceremonies, they would enact the defense of [[Mondstadt]].

There were three acts in the ceremony dedicated to the winds of time.<br>
The final act told a tale of the protection of Mondstadt, of life, and of freedom.

The ceremony and its history have now been lost.<br>
But the Gunnhildr clan continues to act as guardians of Mondstadt to this day.
