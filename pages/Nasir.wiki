==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nasir:''' You're here! Oh, you're not [[Maziar|him]]...
:{{DIcon}} Are you waiting for someone?
::'''Nasir:''' Oh, yes. I am waiting for... um...
::'''Nasir:''' I'm waiting for the [[Maryam|boss lady]]'s nephew. He can't really hold his alcohol, but he's pretty good at cards.
::'''Nasir:''' I brought some nice booze to share with him, but he isn't in. What a pity.
::'''Nasir:''' I was planning to have a look at... at that funky deck of his.
::'''Nasir:''' *sigh* Why do people have to work? There's no time to eat, drink, and play with friends when you're working.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Maybe he's tied up.
:::'''Nasir:''' Probably. He does sometimes say "I'm not an idler, buddy." Then he would deal with the affairs of the hotel business.
:::'''Nasir:''' *sigh* Drinking alone is really not fun. Not to mention it's also a waste of the delicious grilled meat. Why don't you take it while it's still fresh?
:::'''Nasir:''' Find a friend to share this with. Don't be like me...
::;(Obtain {{Item|Tandoori Roast Chicken|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Sorry if I bothered.
::'''Nasir:''' Nah, it's fine. Guess I'll wait a little longer...
