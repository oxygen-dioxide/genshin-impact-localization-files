== Lyrics ==
See, sometimes it's rainy<br>
Sometimes it's cloudy<br>
That's what journey means<br>
Can't see<br>
The scene ahead is blurry<br>
But we still must pursue the dream

Travel through the heights and shallows<br>
Put on a sturdy shell<br>
To face the hard perils<br>
I hear about your last trace<br>
Love is shining bright in the deep night<br>
Stand up to fight many times<br>
Then know what's wrong and right<br>
The scars will finally heal

Do not fear<br>
[[The Road Not Taken|The road not taken]]<br>
The unresolved problem<br>
Do not go<br>
Gentle into that good night<br>
The day I want to seize<br>
Comes with the greetings of the breeze<br>
Will there be that day?<br>
Please tell me<br>
Tell me

Travel through infinite dusks and dawns<br>
Break through the strong tide<br>
To reach the other side<br>
I hear about your last trace<br>
Some words are heavy when some words are light<br>
We are like two meteors that miss each other<br>
We will finally reunite

To catch up<br>
With the sunlight, with the brightest fire<br>
The memories<br>
Softly touch my face<br>
The freedom I want to seize<br>
Takes me to an unknown place<br>
At the journey's end<br>
We will meet

Chorus:<br>
To catch up<br>
With the sunlight, with the brightest fire<br>
Because of you<br>
The story will go on<br>
The quest along the way<br>
We will always appreciate<br>
At the journey's end<br>
We will meet<br>
We will meet again
