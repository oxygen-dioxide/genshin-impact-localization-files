:'''"Flowerbed" Advert:''' "Entrance is a one-off payment of just 7,000 Mora for lifetime access! Come in and test your limits!"

:'''Another Person's Message:''' "No, no, no, just think about it. Building everything cost so much Mora and took so long. If it weren't worth it, don't you think work would've been halted long ago?"
:'''Message:''' "You have a point. In any case, it's lifetime access, so..."
