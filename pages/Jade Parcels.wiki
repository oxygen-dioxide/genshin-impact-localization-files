==Trivia==
*Jade Parcels is required in the [[Daily Commission]] ''[[A Returning Customer]]''.
*The dish appears in the [https://weibo.com/7072153506/M3RiRAn1u {{zh|【百味盈欢】}}] event of [https://tot.hoyoverse.com/en-us ''Tears of Themis''], another miHoYo game. It can be seen on Vyn Richter's MR card.

===Etymology===
*This dish is probably based on {{Lang|jade cabbage dumplings|zh=翡翠白菜饺子|zh_rm=fěicuì báicài jiǎozi|zh_lit=jadeite Chinese cabbage dumplings}}, even though the green part of the real dish is made of green-colored dough, not of cabbage.
**Both dishes mimic the {{w|Jadeite Cabbage}}, a beautiful jadeite sculpture that is considered to be one of the three most important treasures of the {{w|National Palace Museum}}.
