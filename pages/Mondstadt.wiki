{{Description|A city of freedom that lies in the northeast of [[Teyvat]]. From amongst mountains and wide-open plains, carefree breezes carry the scent of dandelions &mdash; a gift from the Anemo God, Barbatos &mdash; across Cider Lake to Mondstadt, which sits on an island in the middle of the lake.}}
{{Lang|'''Mondstadt'''|de=''Mondstadt''|de_tl=Moon City}} is one of the seven regions in [[Teyvat]], and the first in which the [[Traveler]] starts to look for their [[Traveler's Sibling|lost sibling]]. It is the city-state that worships [[Barbatos]], the [[Anemo]] [[Archon]].

Ever since the beginning, Mondstadt has celebrated a [[festival]] called the [[Ludi Harpastum]] every year, with 15 days of games for the children to enjoy.

Before completing [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]]: Act I - [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]], only small parts of [[Starfell Valley]], [[Galesong Hill]], and [[Windwail Highland]] are accessible.

The Archon Quest Prologue: The Outlander Who Caught the Wind takes place in this region.

|[[City of Mondstadt|Mondstadt]]
|The namesake and center of the region.<br /><br />It features cobblestone streets and has several windmills both large and small dotting the city. The lower area houses the market district, while the upper area is for the Cathedral and the Library.
|[[File:City of Mondstadt.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Cider Lake]]
|A natural freshwater lake.<br /><br />The lake's wide, crystalline appearance has remained unchanged for eons &mdash; so clear you can see the bottom, and cool and refreshing to drink. It is none other than these headwaters that brought Mondstadt's ciders and wines to fame and made the lake the symbol of Mondstadt that it is today.

|-
|[[Falcon Coast]]
|Stretching eastward from Windrise to the sea, Falcon Coast &mdash; together with Cape Oath &mdash; shelters the sea from three sides, creating a bay that sits east of Mondstadt.<br /><br />Given the long coastline and shallow waters, citizens of Mondstadt often come here to enjoy a nice stroll. On occasion, you can see falcons soaring high above the blue waves that brush upon the white sand.
|[[File:Falcon Coast.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Cape Oath]]
|In the southeast corner of Mondstadt's surrounds lies a cape that borders with Galesong Hill.<br /><br />Legend has it two lovers made an oath to each other here, and left behind a deeply touching story. To this day the area is still known to be popular amongst young lovebirds.<br /><br />Other than being a great vantage point for watching sunrises and sunsets, the drop in terrain makes it easy to see Windrise, which sits facing the sea.
|[[File:Cape oath.jpeg|180px]]
|-
|[[Dawn Winery]]
|Nestled in the land southwest of Mondstadt sits the winery that has passed down the legacy of Mondstadt's traditional wines and ciders for generations.<br /><br />The grapes grown here are used to produce a range of wines that are popular right across Teyvat.<br /><br />Every year's products are split, with a portion being sold locally within Mondstadt, the rest is sold off via the trade route that sits south of the city.
|[[File:Dawn Winery.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Springvale]]
|A sleepy little village to the south of Mondstadt, that sits facing the lake that surrounds the city.<br /><br />Most of the village's residents are hunters that provide fresh meat for all the big restaurants of Mondstadt.<br /><br />Springvale's rustic appeal attracts many tourists. If you are lucky in your travels, you may come across a restaurant that truly knows how to bring out the best qualities of Springvale's meat.
|[[File:Springvale.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Thousand Winds Temple]]
|A collection of temple ruins that sits northeast of Mondstadt.<br /><br />According to local legend, millennia ago this area was a temple for worshipping the Anemo God. Though it has been left to waste for centuries, leaving the ruins you see today. If you look closely at some of the stone pillars, you can still faintly make out some elegant carvings.<br /><br />This long-forgotten symbol of commemoration is engraved with the maxim: "Wind brings the seeds of tales, time allows them to take root."<!--In-game, it's "Seeds of stories, brought by the wind and cultivated by time."-->

|[[Dornman Port]]
|A port in Mondstadt that handles international trade.
|[[File:Unknown.png|50px]]

|[[Musk Reef]]
|A small island to the east of Cape Oath, accessible by solving a puzzle there. The [[Spiral Abyss]] can be found on Musk Reef, which requires [[Adventure Rank]] 20 to enter.

==Trivia==
===In-game===
* Mondstadt considers its trademarks the Dandelion, Flight and Wine, being the very few things that Mondstadt learned from the Wind Archon to build Mondstadt.
* Roses in Mondstadt, instead of love, represent the saying "As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed." It encourages people to keep one another's secrets.
* Citizens and people in [[Liyue]] often mock Mondstadt for being a city without rule with their god abandoned, showcasing the contrast between how others view freedom versus constitution. They are also unaware of the reasons as to why the [[Anemo Archon]] decided not to rule over Mondstadt, which may hint that every other region shares the same outlook.
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]], there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Mea libertas meus canor''" which translates to "My freedom is my song."
* Many characters wear gloves that have a different color on the palm compared to the back. This could be because the palm-side is made from a different material which provides better grip. It appears to be a fashion unique to Mondstadt.
* Mondstadt is the only region whose capital lacks background NPCs.

===Etymology===
* Mondstadt is German for "Moon City", and the architecture of Mondstadt is inspired by {{w|Timber framing|half-timbered}} houses, medieval buildings that are typical for Germany.
** The official English translation of the [[manga]] sometimes abbreviates the name as "Mond", which is how it is translated in Chinese, as well as Japanese and Korean.

===Cultural references===
* Mondstadt is inspired by mainly German culture as well as various other Northern European cultures.
** Culture-wise and landscape-wise Mondstadt closely resembles Germany's {{w|Rhineland-Palatinate}} state. Wine culture has dominated this region for 2000 years. Many historic villages and towns are built like Mondstadt in a half-timbered architecture style with grand gothic cathedrals. The Rhineland's landscape is lush and green, rolling hills take turns with high and steep cliffs. The steepest vineyards in the world are to be found there. Like Mondstadt, the Rhineland's landscape is dotted with the ruins of an ancient civilization, that of the Romans.
* Many of Mondstadt's characters have German names or titles: Klee means "clover" in German. Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung means "Princess of Condemnation". Albedo, the Kreideprinz means "Prince of Chalk". Diona of KÃ¤tzlein bloodline means "Kitten" bloodline.
* Mondstadt's annual spring festival is called Windblume, which is German for "Wind Flower".
* The font of Mondstadt's written language is a broken up and mirrored version of {{w|Fraktur}}, a font most typical in German-speaking countries from the Middle Ages until the early 21st century. You can still see it on many signs or old houses in Germany. The language itself is English however, likely for easier international understanding.
* The most important statue of Barbatos stands at Windrise under a massive oak tree. The oak is the national tree of Germany, thus oak leaves are a prominent symbol on most German military orders and currency.
** The de facto ruling body of Mondstadt are the Knights of Favonius which mirrors the {{w|State of the Teutonic Order}}, in which the Grand Master of the Order is the head of state.
* Mondstadt is also called the Free City or City of Freedom, this title was given to sovereignly ruled city states of the {{w|Holy Roman Empire}}, the medieval predecessor of what today is Germany. Today the official name of German cities, especially those of the {{w|Hanseatic League}} like Hamburg or Bremen, still carry the Free City prefix.
* While the national bird of Mondstadt {{lang|''yÄ«ng''|zh=é¹°}} is translated as a falcon in the English version, in reality it more commonly means an eagle/hawk in Mandarin (see [[Vennessa#Trivia]] for details). The eagle is one of the most significant symbols of Germany, and the Federal Republic of Germany adopts the {{w|Coat of arms of Germany|Bundesadler}} ("Federal Eagle" in German) as its coat of arms. It is a successor of the Reichsadler ("Imperial Eagle") of the Holy Roman Empire, which in turn originates from the {{w|Aquila (Roman)|Aquila}} of ancient Rome, the symbol of the Roman legions.
* "{{lang|de=''Die Luft der Freiheit weht''|mini=1}}," meaning "The wind of freedom blows," is a notable German motto originated from a Latin phrase written by the German poet laureate and humanist {{w|Ulrich von Hutten}} (1488â1523). See [[Venti/Lore#Etymology|Venti's Etymology section]] for details.
* Since the {{w|Romanticism|Romantic era}} Germans call their country "Das Land der Dichter und Denker" ("The Land of Poets and Thinkers"). Mondstadt is famous for being a nation of poetry too. Fittingly, the original Chinese version as well as the Japanese version of the game call Mondstadt's biggest hotel the "Goethe Grand Hotel". {{w|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe}} was Germany's most prominent poet of the Romantic era. In the English version of the game, probably due to a translation mistake, the aforementioned hotel is called the [[Goth Grand Hotel]].
** Goethe was also a major contributor to the philosophy of freedom and the most famous quotes from his magnum opus ''{{w|Goethe's Faust|Faust}}'' include {{Lang|"The last result of wisdom stamps it true: he only earns his freedom and existence who daily conquers them anew"|de="Das ist der Weisheit letzter SchluÃ: der verdient sich Freiheit wie das Leben, der tÃ¤glich sie erobern muÃ"}} (translated by {{w|Bayard Taylor}}), of which the first clause is cited as the English name of [[Der Weisheit Letzter Schluss (Life)|Mona's special food]].
* The Black-Back Hound dog race, that the game archive says originates in Mondstadt, is of the distinctive tan and black fur color and pattern of the {{w|German Shepherd}}.
* The icon for Mondstadt consists of a six-spoked {{w|post mill}}, something commonly found throughout Medieval Europe.
** The Anemo icon goes around the windmill and is reminiscent of a large predatory bird.
