{{Description|A city of freedom that lies in the northeast of [[Teyvat]].<br />From amongst mountains and wide-open plains, carefree breezes carry the scent of dandelions &mdash; a gift from the Anemo God, Barbatos &mdash; across Cider Lake to Mondstadt, which sits on an island in the middle of the lake.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Genshin Impact Official Website]}}
'''Mondstadt''' is one of the seven regions in [[Teyvat]], and the first in which the [[Traveler]] starts to look for their [[Traveler's Sibling|lost sibling]]. It is the city-state that worships [[Barbatos|Lord Barbatos]], the [[Anemo]] [[Archon]].

Ever since the beginning, Mondstadt has celebrated a [[festival]] called the [[Ludi Harpastum]] every year, with 15 days of games for the children to enjoy.

Before completing [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]]: Act I - [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]], only small parts of [[Starfell Valley]], [[Galesong Hill]], and [[Windwail Highland]] are accessible.

The Archon Quest Prologue: The Outlander Who Caught the Wind takes place in this region.

==Trivia==
===In Game===
* Mondstadt considers its trademarks the Dandelion, Flight and Wine, being the very few things that Mondstadt learned from the Wind Archon to build Mondstadt.
* Roses in Mondstadt, instead of love, represent the saying "As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed." It encourages people to keep one another's secrets.
* Citizens and people in [[Liyue]] often mock Mondstadt for being a city without rule with their god abandoned, showcasing the contrast between how others view freedom versus constitution. They are also unaware of the reasons as to why the [[Anemo Archon]] decided not to rule over Mondstadt, which may hint that every other region shares the same outlook.
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]], there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Mea libertas meus canor''" which translates to "My freedom is my song."
* Mondstadt is the only region whose capital lacks background NPCs.

===Etymology=== 
* Mondstadt is German for "Moon City".
** The official English translation of the [[manga]] sometimes abbreviates the name as "Mond", which is how it is translated in Chinese, as well as Japanese and Korean.

===Cultural References===
* Mondstadt is inspired by mainly German culture.
** Culture-wise and landscape-wise Mondstadt closely resembles Germany's {{w|Rhineland-Palatinate}} state. Wine culture has dominated this region for 2000 years. Annual [[Weinlesefest]]s are held there just as they are in Mondstadt. Historic villages and towns are built like Mondstadt in a {{w|Timber framing|half-timbered}} architecture style with gothic churches and cathedrals. The Rhineland's landscape is lush and green, rolling hills take turns with high and steep cliffs. The steepest vineyards in the world are to be found there. Like Mondstadt, the Rhineland's landscape is dotted with the ruins of an ancient civilization, that of the Romans.
* Many of Mondstadt's characters have German names or titles: Klee means "clover" in German. Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung means "Princess of Condemnation". Albedo, Kreideprinz means "Prince of Chalk". Diona of Kätzlein bloodline means of "Kitten" bloodline. Mika Schmidt's family name is the German version of "Smith".
* Mondstadt's annual spring festival is called Windblume, which is German for "Wind Flower".
* Mondstadt's annual autumn festival is called Weinlesefest, which is German for "Wine Harvesting Festival".
* The font of Mondstadt's written language is a broken up and mirrored version of {{w|Fraktur}}, a font most typical in German-speaking countries from the Middle Ages until the early 21st century. You can still see it on many signs or old houses in Germany. The language itself is English however, likely for easier international understanding.
* The most important statue of Barbatos stands at Windrise under a massive oak tree. The oak is the national tree of Germany, thus oak leaves are a prominent symbol on most German military orders and currency.
** The de facto ruling body of Mondstadt are the Knights of Favonius which mirrors the {{w|State of the Teutonic Order}}, in which the Grand Master of the Order is the head of state.
* Mondstadt is also called the Free City or City of Freedom, this title was given to sovereignly ruled city states of the {{w|Holy Roman Empire}}, the medieval predecessor of what today is Germany. Today the official name of German cities, especially those of the {{w|Hanseatic League}} like Hamburg or Bremen, still carry the Free City prefix.
* While the national bird of Mondstadt {{lang|''yīng''|zh=鹰}} is translated as a falcon in the English version, in reality it more commonly means an eagle/hawk in Mandarin (see [[Vennessa#Trivia]] for details). The eagle is one of the most significant symbols of Germany, and the Federal Republic of Germany adopts the {{w|Coat of arms of Germany|Bundesadler}} ("Federal Eagle" in German) as its coat of arms. It is a successor of the Reichsadler ("Imperial Eagle") of the Holy Roman Empire, which in turn originates from the {{w|Aquila (Roman)|Aquila}} of ancient Rome, the symbol of the Roman legions.
* "{{lang|de=''Die Luft der Freiheit weht''|mini=1}}," meaning "The wind of freedom blows," is a notable German motto originated from a Latin phrase written by the German poet laureate and humanist {{w|Ulrich von Hutten}} (1488–1523). See [[Venti/Lore#Etymology|Venti's Etymology section]] for details.
* Since the {{w|Romanticism|Romantic era}} Germans call their country "Das Land der Dichter und Denker" ("The Land of Poets and Thinkers"). Mondstadt is famous for being a nation of poetry too. Fittingly, the original Chinese version as well as the Japanese version of the game call Mondstadt's biggest hotel the "Goethe Grand Hotel". {{w|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe}} was Germany's most prominent poet of the Romantic era. In the English version of the game, probably due to a translation mistake, the aforementioned hotel is called the [[Goth Grand Hotel]].
** Goethe was also a major contributor to the philosophy of freedom and the most famous quotes from his magnum opus ''{{w|Goethe's Faust|Faust}}'' include {{Lang|"The last result of wisdom stamps it true: he only earns his freedom and existence who daily conquers them anew"|de="Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluß: der verdient sich Freiheit wie das Leben, der täglich sie erobern muß"}} (translated by {{w|Bayard Taylor}}), of which the first clause is cited as the English name of [[Der Weisheit Letzter Schluss (Life)|Mona's special food]].
* The Black-Back Hound dog race, that the game archive says originates in Mondstadt, is of the distinctive tan and black fur color and pattern of the {{w|German Shepherd}}.
* The icon for Mondstadt consists of a six-spoked {{w|post mill}}, something commonly found throughout Medieval Europe.
** The Anemo icon goes around the windmill and is reminiscent of a large predatory bird.
