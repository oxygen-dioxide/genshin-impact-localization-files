'''Niwa Nagamitsu''' was a historical figure in [[Inazuma]], a member of the [[Niwa Family]], and a bladesmith of the [[Raiden Gokaden]]'s [[Isshin Art]]. Nagamitsu was one of the Isshin Art's best bladesmiths and went down in history as one of the Isshin Sansaku.

==Profile==
Nagamitsu was an apprentice of the Isshin Art alongside [[Akame Mitsunaga]] and [[Kaedehara Kagemitsu]] when [[Futsu Masayoshi]], the bladesmith of [[Haran Geppaku Futsu]], approached them. Having left the Futsu school to avoid a succession crisis between himself and the fourth-generation master [[Futsu Hiroyoshi]], Masayoshi left to travel around and learn the techniques of other forging practices. The three apprenticed under Masayoshi and went on to create each piece in the Isshin Sansaku.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Haran Geppaku Futsu|Lore}}</ref><!--

===Etymology===
* The names {{lang|''Kagemitsu''|ja=景光}}, {{lang|''Nagamitsu''|ja=長光}}, and {{lang|''Sanenaga''|ja=実長}} (rendered in the English localization as Mitsunaga) are derived from the three disciples of {{lang|Mitsutada|ja=光忠}}, the greatest swordsmith of the Bizen School who went on to establish the Osafune School. The three were known as the Sansaku, or Three Great Masters.
** Osafune Nagamitsu, Mitsutada's son who went on to inherit the Osafune School, is most famous for forging the Dai Hannya Nagamitsu.<ref>e-Museum of the National Institutes for Cultural Heritage: [https://emuseum.nich.go.jp/detail?langId=en&webView=&content_base_id=100184&content_part_id=001&content_pict_id=001&x=-192&y=-182&s=1 Long sword signed Nagamitsu (a.k.a.
