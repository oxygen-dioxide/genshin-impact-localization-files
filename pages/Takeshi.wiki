====Dialogue Set #1====
''Available between completing [[As Though Caught in a Dream]] and [[As Though Beholding Illusions]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Takeshi at the ramen stand)
:'''Takeshi:''' Glory to&mdash; Err, I mean, glorious day we're having! How may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} I swear I've seen you before, at [[Tenshukaku]]...
:'''Takeshi:''' *cough* I guess nothing gets past you, huh? Anyway... since the [[Raiden Shogun|Almighty Shogun]] is no longer at Tenshukaku, the areas that we, the Okuzumeshuu, must protect have... also shifted.

''Available after completing [[As Though Beholding Illusions]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Takeshi at the ramen stand)
:'''Takeshi:''' We've been informed of the situation. As an Okuzumeshuu member, it shames me to think that we can do nothing but watch while you and the Shogun go to meet the foe...
:'''Takeshi:''' Our thoughts and prayers go out to you, however. And if you should need a bowl of [[Kitsune]] Ramen to replenish your strength, just say the word!
