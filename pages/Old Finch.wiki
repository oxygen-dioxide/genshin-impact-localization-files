==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Old Finch is a resident of [[Springvale]]. When he was a boy, he befriended the [[Spring Fairy]], although her existence was relegated to a mere fairy tale by most other residents of the village. He would often tell her about his life, while she told him about various things she had done in the village. One day, however, she refused to meet him again; Old Finch waited by the pool for some thirty to forty years just to see her again, to no avail.

During the ''[[Wishful Drops]]'' event, the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], and the young [[Lochfolk]] [[Endora]] visit him while investigating why Springvale's waters hadn't turned bitter while the [[Bishui River]] did. He remarks that Endora looks like a smaller Spring Fairy, which prompts Endora to inform him that they are both Lochfolk. Although the Spring Fairy refused to communicate with Endora, Endora gives her a message from Old Finch.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (I)}}</ref> Later, the three return to Springvale, where Endora receives a reply from the Spring Fairy which explained why the Spring Fairy no longer met him, and imploring Old Finch to move on with his life.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (II)}}</ref>

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Old Finch:''' Spring fairy... Oh, spring fairy...
:'''Old Finch:''' Hmm? Oh, sorry, Traveler. What's up?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Old Finch:''' I'm Finch, haha. I'm also old, as you can see, which is why they all call me Old Finch.
::'''Old Finch:''' What are you here for? Are you... are you here for the spring fairy, too?
:{{DIcon}} Spring fairy?
::'''Old Finch:''' Yes, there's a fairy in this spring. You wouldn't have heard of it, and none of the villagers believe in it.
::'''Old Finch:''' But when I was a boy, I would talk to her here all the time...
::'''Old Finch:''' We'd talk about the weather, the spring water, the fish, who had fallen out with who in the village...
::'''Old Finch:''' And when a kid fell into the spring, she'd tell me how she had secretly helped them back out and given them a few pretty stones to make them feel better...
::'''Old Finch:''' She is a gentle-natured fairy.
::'''Old Finch:''' But suddenly, one day, she refused to see me any longer.
::{{DIcon}} So... what are you doing here?
::'''Old Finch:''' How many years now... thirty? No &mdash; forty?
::'''Old Finch:''' Well anyway, it's been half a lifetime that I've waited here, just hoping to see her one last time... and to hear her wonderful, flowing voice...
::'''Old Finch:''' But after all this time, I'm sure she's probably... gone...
::'''Old Finch:''' Whenever I have that thought, I realize... Look how old I am now... Too old to go traveling around Teyvat looking for her...
::'''Old Finch:''' So all I can do is wait here, on the off chance that there's still some hope.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Old Finch:''' Goodbye.
::'''Old Finch:''' *sigh* If only I were still young, like you...
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Old Finch's story with the Spring Fairy is extremely similar to that told in the book collection ''[[Heart of Clear Springs]]''. Unlike the boy in the story, however, Old Finch eventually learns the reason why the Spring Fairy left him, as well as confirmation that she truly existed.
