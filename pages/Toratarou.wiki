{{Lang|'''Toratarou'''|ja=寅太郎|ja_rm=Toratarou}} is a [[Shiba]] that is found locked in a cage on [[Jinren Island]]. It is possible to free him by completing the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] [[Free the Dog]] which grants players the {{Achievement|Who Let the Dogs Out}}.

According to dialogue in [[The Farmer's Treasure]], Toratarou is owned by the [[Kairagi]] and [[Nobushi]] group of Jinren Island. However, when [[Saimon Jirou]] is threatened to have the dogs unleashed on him, he wonders if they are talking about other dogs apart from Toratarou, as he claims that Toratarou is a very friendly dog that wouldn't bite anyone.
