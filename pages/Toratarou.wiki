'''Toratarou''' is a [[Shiba]] that can be found on [[Jinren Island]]. Their name is mentioned in the description of the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Who Let the Dogs Out]]."

It is initially locked inside a wooden cage at the south of the island, guarded by a [[Nobushi]]. While it is locked, the player can feed it 1 [[Fowl]], or free it using 1 [[Metal Key]]. Upon freeing, the "[[Who Let the Dogs Out]]" Achievement will be granted, and Toratarou will lead the player north of the island, revealing a half-buried [[Precious Chest]] that spawns after, and then soon disappear.

According to dialogue in [[The Farmer's Treasure]], Toratarou is owned by the Kaigari and Nobushi group of Jinren Island. However, when [[Saimon Jirou]] is threatened to have the dogs unleashed on him, he wonders if they are talking about other dogs apart from Toratarou, as he claims that Toratarou is a very friendly dog that wouldn't bite anyone.
