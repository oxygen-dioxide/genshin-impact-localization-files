{{Description|The primitive wandering inhabitants of Teyvat's wildernesses.<br />Hilichurl warriors who have wooden shields. These shields are not only sturdy defense tools but also treasured items within the tribe. According to many reports, hilichurls will often charge at travelers making camp to cook and will snatch their pot lids after chasing them away.|[[Archive]]}}
{{Enemy Intro}}

Its shield and club are considered {{Dendro}} objects, and can be burned and destroyed with {{Pyro}}. It is possible to burn only the shield and leave the club intact, and vice versa. When the shield catches fire, the Hilichurl Guard will panic and dance around while trying to put out the fire. Typically, the shield will be completely burnt before the fire can be extinguished, unless it [[Elemental Reactions|reacts]] with another element.
