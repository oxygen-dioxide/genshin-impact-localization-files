{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Behaim:''' May the [[Anemo Archon]] bless me, so that I will always remember the past...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Behaim:''' I am... *sigh* I don't remember. Guess I am just a graybeard drifting in the wind.
::'''Behaim:''' When I was a young lad, I met a girl from [[Sumeru]] in a place where the wind blew.
::'''Behaim:''' Who would have thought that this girl, beautiful as a flower in the spring, was the captain of a merchant fleet!
::'''Behaim:''' I was mesmerized by her, and followed her to the home of trees and flowers. I lived a life that was more delightful than in the most romantic poetry.
::'''Behaim:''' Now she is gone like a spring flower in the wind... and I'm still here.
:{{DIcon}} The past?
::'''Behaim:''' Yes, those things of the past...
::'''Behaim:''' I'm old. My memory is like drawings in the sand, easily erased by the wind.
::'''Behaim:''' Thankfully, under the blessings of Lord Barbatos, the story of me and her is still traveling with the wind.
::'''Behaim:''' The past that I still remember is like the lingering wind. It is still lively but will suddenly dissipate at some point.
::'''Behaim:''' Haha, I should visit the nearby carpenter shop to make a sign that has "Where the Wind Lingers" carved on it. Then I'll put it up in front of my house. What do you say?
::'''Behaim:''' That way, even if I become truly senile one day and forget everything, I'll at least have this to find my way home.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} May the Anemo Archon bless you!
:::'''Behaim:''' Yes, yes, you are right...
:::'''Behaim:''' Lord Barbatos adores poetry. I'm sure he will engrave my poems for her into the wind...
::;(Obtain [[Guide to Ballad]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Take care.
::'''Behaim:''' You too, kid.
