{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter quest location)
:'''Magnifico:''' "...Where steel and phlogiston did collide... *humming*... I slipped and fell into the lava below..."
:'''Magnifico:''' "...*humming* They buried me in a great tomb that knows no sound, but don't you know, I'm still around, and around, and around~"

;(Approach Magnifico)
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha, my dear {{Traveler}} and Paimon, my muse and my... Err, mini-muse!
:'''Magnifico:''' Ah yes, and {{Little One}}, of course!
:'''Paimon:''' Hah! Who's the mini-me here, anyway?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Raaawr!
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha, come now, don't mind me.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, Paimon minds a lot!
:{{DIcon}} Newly-inspired, are we?
::'''Magnifico:''' Of course! However... Hehe, new inspiration means... that I'll need your help once more.
::'''Paimon:''' No problem! You pay every time, anyway.
::'''Magnifico:''' Haha, wonderful, my little mercenary!
:{{DIcon}} Require ye the succor of your... mousses once more, then?
::'''Paimon:''' Mousse... Heh, Paimon's feeling hungry already...
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Groo... Groo...
::'''Magnifico:''' Uh, you mean "muses," don't you? Those aren't for eating!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, so long as you're paying, that Mora will soon become food!
::'''Magnifico:''' Whatever you say, Paimon... But I do indeed have money, so you shan't have to worry about working for free!
:'''Magnifico:''' You see, I'm taking a photo of a Tepetlisaurus this time... Shh. Careful now, we don't want to disturb it.
:'''Magnifico:''' This is my first time interacting with such a [[Saurian]], but I've been observing them for a while now... Truly fascinating creatures they are, each with unique personalities beneath their hardened shells.
:'''Magnifico:''' Hehe, this one's learned some basic commands after being fed a few times, to boot.
:'''Magnifico:''' Still, I'm going to need your help, dear Saurian tamers, to bring the wayward Saurian with us and take a photo of it interacting with its fellow Tepetlisaurs.
:'''Magnifico:''' Hehe, a simple task, eh?
:'''Paimon:''' Yup, super easy!
:{{DIcon}} (Not that you're the one who actually has to do it...)
:{{DIcon}} (And it's not as simple as you might think...!)
:'''Magnifico:''' Haha, yes, that's the spirit! Come then, bring me the stray Tepetlisaurus, and we can begin!

;(Interact with the book, optional)
:'''"Detective Snowpaws":''' (The biography of Frank Drebin, retired Inspector of [[Fontaine]]'s [[Marechaussee Phantom]] special police force. Yep, the Inspector is a vigorous white cat.)
:'''"Detective Snowpaws":''' (A big cat paw print is imprinted on the title page of this book, perhaps a special memento the Inspector has left for his subordinates.)
:'''Paimon:''' Seriously... Might as well write a book about Paimon too, called... The White-Haired Detective!

;(Talk to Magnifico without indwelling a Tepetlisaurus, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' Come then, help me find a Tepetlisaurus, and we can begin!

;(Talk to Magnifico while indwelling a Tepetlisaurus)
:'''Paimon:''' Here comes the Tepetlisaurus! Let's start taking pictures, shall we?
:'''Magnifico:''' Capital idea!

;(Talk to Magnifico again, optional)
:'''Magnifico:''' "...As fragrant flowers do the dark woods grace..."
:'''Magnifico:''' "...Afore we part, grant me your embrace~"
:'''Magnifico:''' Hmm? Oh, sorry, just humming a little ditty again.

;(Touch the marker on the right)
:'''Magnifico:''' A little to the left... Alright, very good, very good... Yes!
:'''Magnifico:''' Hmm, to the right a bit, would you? Feels like we're just missing that little je ne sais quoi...

;(Touch the marker on the left)
:'''Magnifico:''' No, this spot won't do... Simply can't get a decent composition for the shot.

;(Touch the marker in the back middle)
:'''Magnifico:''' Now I'd give this a passing grade, were we staging a rehearsal. Alas, we are not. Let's pick another spot.

;(Touch the marker on the rock)
:'''Magnifico:''' Huh...?
:'''Magnifico:''' (Traveler), Paimon, over here! I've found something interesting!
:'''Magnifico:''' Have you noticed? Our little fellow seems to have taken note of something... Family, perhaps?
:'''Magnifico:''' It's heading over on its own! Come now, let's follow &mdash; we can't afford to lose it!

;(Approach the caged [[Desert Sumpter Beast|Sumpter Beast]])
:'''Magnifico:''' Huh? Is there a... Sumpter Best in that cage? Why would one even be here?
:'''Magnifico:''' Actually, why's there even a cage here at all?
:'''Magnifico:''' Forget that for now... Look! The Sumpter's in danger!

;(Upon approaching the enemies)
:'''Poacher:''' Who the...!? They're after the Sumpter Beasts!

;(On defeating the poachers)
:'''Poacher:''' Wait, it's awake!? Run!
:;(Eroding Avatar of Lava spawns in)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh oh, looks like we've got a tough customer!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{Black Screen|You defeat the enemy and smash open the cage imprisoning the little Sumpter Beast. It leaps out of the cage and sends a happy cry your way.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... Phew! Well, that's over. What a rush!
:'''Magnifico:''' Shh&mdash;! Look...
:'''Magnifico:''' *click*
:'''Magnifico:''' Perfect.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, they're getting along so well... And here Paimon thought that the Sumpter Beast might get eaten... or something.
:'''Magnifico:''' Hehe, now, now. Tepetlisaurs might look fierce, but they're actually gentle souls.
:'''Magnifico:''' Well, that's the photo taken, and here's your copy. Ah, yes, and your payment... here.
:'''Magnifico:''' *sigh* Here I thought we might capture an intimate moment between a Tepetlisaur whelp and an adult &mdash; but it seems the Sumpter Beast was one step ahead!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, c'mon, Sumpter Beasts aren't that annoying. Paimon's sure you think so too!
:'''Magnifico:''' Well, it doesn't matter what I think &mdash; it's the photography judging committee's opinion that counts!
:'''Magnifico:''' Still... It might be too dangerous for our lil' Sumpter Beast to wander about in Natlan's unfamiliar environs. And I happen to need a partner to help carry some things...
:'''Magnifico:''' Why, I suppose I'll just have to take it in.
:'''Paimon:''' What about its original owner, then...?
:'''Magnifico:''' Hmph. His own fault for leaving the little beastie out here in such a dangerous spot!
:'''Magnifico:''' But anyway, enough of that! Fontaine's photo galleries, here I come! Haha... I trust you'll visit when the time comes as well, alright?
:'''Magnifico:''' My apologies, but I must leave this nation now. Farewell, {{Traveler}}, Paimon! Farewell, my little fellow!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Magnifico:''' Also... catch! A memento, so you don't forget me, little ones!
