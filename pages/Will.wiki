'''Will''' is an open-world [[NPC]] in [[Mondstadt]]. He can be found with [[Jill]] at [[Falcon Coast]] during daytime (06:00 – 19:00). They want to play with [[Dr. Edith]] at [[Windrise]] but are trying to get away from [[Mack]], a Knight of Favonius who is keeping watch over them wherever they go.

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player four [[Fish]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Will:''' Huh? Hi!
:{{DIcon}} You kids be careful playing on the beach, now.
::'''Will:''' I'll be fine!
::'''Will:''' But Mr. Guard keeps following us and Jill's scared to death.
::'''Will:''' D'you think he's one of those, y'know... bad men who... who... make little kids... learn to read and write, and give them too much homework?
::'''Will:''' We were gonna go and play with Ms. Edith at Windrise, but now we're stuck here hiding...
:{{DIcon}} Know much about Falcon Coast?
::'''Will:''' I love Falcon Coast!
::'''Will:''' Granny always takes me there to play, ever since I was teeny tiny.
::'''Will:''' Wow... I love your hair! It looks all soft like the nicest sand on the beach! Can I touch it?
:{{DIcon}} Be careful not to get lost.
::'''Will:''' Hee-hee!
:{{DIcon|Reward}} Having fun on the beach?
::'''Will:''' Yep! The scenery is soooo different from Mondstadt.
::'''Will:''' I even caught a fish! Fish skin is slippery, so they're super hard to catch... Well, harder than catching crabs anyway. That's what Jill does.
::'''Will:''' But anyway, I don't have a bowl to put this fish in. So why don't you take it?
