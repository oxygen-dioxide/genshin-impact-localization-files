'''The Cat's Affection''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Seirai Island]], [[Inazuma]], to the right of the [[Slumbering Court]]. It requires the completion of the {{Quest|Neko Is a Cat: Shrine Recipe}} and it is time-gated over 4 real-life days (3 server resets).

==Steps==
Feed {{Item|Delicious Invigorating Kitty Meal|x=1|25}} to the cat on the paw-shaped rock once a day. After the server resets, the kitten will change from one toe to the next one, until it is on the last one, where it will spawn a [[Precious Chest]] and award the {{Achievement|A Cat's Gift}} upon feeding it.
