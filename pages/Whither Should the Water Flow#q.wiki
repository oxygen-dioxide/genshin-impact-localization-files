{{Quest Description|Having met with the troupe, you learn two critical members have yet to return. First is Pauleau, who is responsible for completing the script. He is in Poisson.}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' If I remember correctly, this is where he's staying.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 pauleau 01.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Who is it?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 lauwick 02.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' It's me. Is the script ready?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 pauleau 02.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' ...You came all the way here for that?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 lauwick 03.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Ugh, alright, forget that for now. Just come on out, we've got some great news.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 pauleau 03.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Hmph, nice try... Look, just gimme some time, okay? I'm just wrapping up this last part of the script. I'll be out once I'm done.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 lauwick 04.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Okay then. Looking forward to your masterpiece.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So... as expected, he's missed the deadline.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' The ending is one of the most important parts of the show...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 dulphy 02.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Even once he's done, it isn't final until we've all had the chance to read through and make sure we agree on it.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Someone told me they'd just seen you in Poisson. I assumed it was a case of mistaken identity, but sure enough, here you are... and Furina, too.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah... I was wondering if we might run into her...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So, you're here for Pauleau? Looks like he could be a while, so feel free to take a stroll around town in the meantime. I've made all the arrangements already.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 lauwick 05.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Oh, it's okay, we can just wait h&mdash;
:;([[Dulphy]] walks behind [[Lauwick]] and walks away with him)
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 dulphy 03.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Thank you for being so considerate, Miss [[Navia]]! That sounds wonderful. We'll take that stroll!
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 dulphy 04.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Get over here, you! How oblivious are you!?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' How are things in Poisson now? Any better?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Things are on the mend, but it's a slow process. Some people may never recover from the trauma they experienced.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm... sorry to hear that. I wish there was something I could do...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Please... Must our conversations take such a depressing turn every time we meet?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We all have painful memories, but we don't have to let them cloud everything we do.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And if you're trying to make a new start, perhaps it's best if you don't bring up the past all the time.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Thank you for your words of comfort. You make a very good point.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But for now, at least... I think I should stay with the way I'm feeling for a while longer.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's okay. These things take time. Moving on from a painful experience is easier said than done.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Which brings me to why I'm here... I thought you should probably know that not everyone here is ready to forgive and forget after the Hydro Archon's inaction in the face of catastrophe.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' To avoid upsetting the peace, I told the townspeople that everyone here is a member of the theater troupe... and that you are just an actress playing the role of Furina.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's not a perfect solution, but hopefully it means you won't have to lie low while you're here.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's so thoughtful of you, Navia!
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, what do you expect? I am the courageous and considerate president of [[Spina di Rosula]], after all, like [[Callas|my father]] before me.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, that was all. Look after her, now.
:{{DIcon}} Got it, Navia.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Off we go then... Let's take a look up there.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 1 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I don't have any friends that I can be frank and honest with, so maybe she's right. You're the closest thing to friends that I have.
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm so grateful that Miss Navia was so understanding. To be perfectly honest, I didn't know if I was ready to meet her.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It's always easiest to just run away from your problems. But that never fixes anything. You can't get around the obstacles without facing them.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's why you were nervous when they brought up Poisson...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Yeah. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared of coming back here.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Still, I felt it was something I had to do. As I was saying before, I want to see for myself the things that I never could in the past.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'd be overjoyed if the people here could find it in their hearts to forgive me. But they're more likely to unleash a tirade of vitriol against me, which of course I completely understand and accept.
:;(Nearby citizens of Poisson glare at Furina disapprovingly)
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure some people didn't buy Navia's lie.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Yeah... I can tell people are watching me.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sure some people here see the idea of someone coming to Poisson dressed as the Hydro Archon as extremely disrespectful.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I used to be terrified of the gaze of other people, especially when they had suspicion or resentment in their eyes.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...*sigh* I guess I wasn't quite ready for this after all.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's surprised you're making yourself go through all this.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe you've taken on a bit too much in one go?
::{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 10a 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I can't let myself see only the things I want to see. How would that make me any different from before?
:{{DIcon}} Me too. It's not like you.
::{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 10b 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What do you mean by that? You expected me to just keep running and hiding from my responsibility forever?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look... There seems to be a crowd gathering over there.
:{{DIcon}} They're not staying quiet, either.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Probably time we made a move.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 2 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' How about we check out Spina di Rosula's ship? We should have a view of the whole of Poisson from there.

;(Talk to Dulphy or Lauwick on the middle level of Poisson near [[Kosel]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq002 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Ah, there you are. We were just buying some fish. There's a clearance sale right now, and the prices are much better than in the city.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq002 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Who said anything about buying them? You're really gonna carry a huge fish around all day while we're out visiting Pauleau and Vilmant?
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq002 lauwick 02.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Ah... You're right. We don't have anywhere to put it...
<!-- Spoken by Lauwick, but mislabelled as "Dulphy" -->
----
;(Approach the marked spot on the ship)
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sorry, you probably just wanted a relaxing stroll, and here I am dumping all this heavy stuff on you.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We don't mind! It's actually refreshing to see a different side of you.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Great. Well, I appreciate your company, so please don't disappear just yet.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I don't know whether you can tell, but... the years of suffering and loneliness aren't the only reason I have a hard time facing up to who I used to be.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' As I stand here by the ship, I can't get the images of the rising water out of my mind...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' One after another, people were taken by the water... All those treasured lives and memories, washed out of existence in an instant.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' They thought their god would protect them. They had absolute faith that when disaster struck, a divine power would save them from harm.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And all the while, I played my part to perfection to convince them that was true...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But then the flood waters finally came. And the "Hydro Archon" did nothing.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You shouldn't look at it like that. You were only doing your duty.
:{{DIcon}} Don't be so harsh on yourself.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I've had to go through so many moments like that for the sake of protecting the truth. As time went on, it got harder and harder to bear, and I became more lonely and isolated.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Eventually, I realized I had nothing left except the truth. I became terrified of completely failing in my task, and was haunted by the thought of being left all alone, weeping on my throne.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Fortunately, we were able to avoid the worst-case scenario thanks to the help of heroic individuals such as yourselves.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Everyone rose to their responsibilities. And I finally regained my freedom...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But on some level, freedom also means no longer being needed. I have no further use to people.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Paimon would've never imagined you'd see it that way.
:{{DIcon}} Think of your freedom as your reward.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Reward?
:{{DIcon}} Because now, you can finally speak your heart.
:{{DIcon}} You don't have to be anguished and alone anymore.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...I guess so.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Back then, I didn't even dare to dream about having someone to confide in.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I was scared of someone recognizing me for who I truly was, and exposing the secret I swore to protect.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' "Believe in the Furina you see on stage. She is the one you can trust."
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I had to keep all my feelings, all my curiosity about life to myself. No-one could be allowed to know...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' That's what I really meant when I said I'm no good at maintaining relationships.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's where you were coming from... Paimon totally thought you were just a bit of a diva at heart.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Could you please get off my case!? I don't know what's gotten into you today. I'm making an effort here, you could at least try to do the same.
:{{DIcon}} What Paimon meant to say was, she doesn't like to see you so down.
:{{DIcon}} Do you feel better, having gotten all this off your chest?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I do. I once had nothing but the truth, and now, I'm finally free to live my own life again. And even though I have no idea where I'm going right now...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 23.ogg}} '''Furina:''' At least the choice is in my hands.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 furina 24.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, it's about time to head back. Pauleau should have finished the ending by now.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure. Okay, let's head back and check it out.
----
;(Approach Dulphy and Lauwick)
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Didn't you say you needed to watch what you eat? You're supposed to be cutting down on fried foods, not wolfing down copious quantities of fish and chips, y'know?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Ah, c'mon, it's not every day we get to dine at Spina di Rosula's expense... Can you believe how generous she is? I'm not about to pass on free food...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 02.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Anyway, my character doesn't need to be slim and good-looking. That's your job.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 02.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Are you kidding me right now? It's not your character's health I'm worried about! It's yours!
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 03.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' I've spent my whole life battling the effects of ill health, and it kills me to watch you willingly ruin yours by filling yourself up with junk all the time.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, looks like they're arguing again.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're back! Could you maybe put your differences aside for a moment?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 03.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Ah, you're back. We've been enjoying Spina di Rosula's VIP treatment in your stead, hehe.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 04.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Pauleau's nearly done. We shouldn't have to wait too much longer.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great. So, you were discussing your characters, right? We heard she's playing the oceanid who turns into a human girl &mdash; what about you?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 05.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Me? I'm an oceanid, too.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 04.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' He was originally supposed to take the form of a crane, but he... ahem, outgrew that role. Well, the costume, at least. So now he's playing the boar instead.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pff... Sorry, sorry...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The boar's not a bad character, actually. He's the one who raises the little oceanid, yes?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 06.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' That's right. He has some pretty memorable lines, too, like when he imparts some solemn words of wisdom to the little oceanid:
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 07.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' "If you become human, you can reveal your secret to no one. You will face suffering and loneliness... Is this truly what you want?"
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, that sounds kinda familiar...
:;(Paimon and the Traveler turn to look at Furina)
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 05.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' It's the most important line in the whole script. I think it's a symbolic statement about our director's life and legacy.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 06.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' She kept quiet about all the trials and tribulations she faced in running our troupe, allowing us to devote ourselves fully to performing.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 07.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' It was only after she was gone that we realized how tough her job really was.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You mentioned earlier that the troupe was like your "home"...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 08.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Yeah. I was born with an incurable illness, and once my family found out it couldn't be treated, they decided they didn't want me anymore.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 09.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' I spent some years taking whatever work I could find and trying to manage my illness with various medicines. But whenever I had a bad flare-up, I'd be lying in an alleyway for days at a time.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 10.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' It was like that until the director found me one day. She told me I had a great voice, and asked if I was interested in studying singing from her. I said yes.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 11.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' She took me under her wing. Taught me to both sing and act, helped me find Mora for my meds, took care of me when my condition decided to flare up... I know it was all a huge burden on her.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She sounds like a really incredible person.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 08.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' She really was. She gave everything she had to her troupe and the people in it. All of us were so proud to call her our director.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 09.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' I was a lost child, too, when she found me. As the child of a murderer, my parents weren't around when I was little, so I got sent to an orphanage.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 10.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' The other kids were always picking fights with me... They'd say things like, "C'mon, you must be pretty tough if you're the son of a murderer!" It was just to taunt me, though. I was an easy target, and they knew it.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 11.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' One day, I got beaten up so bad that I just couldn't take it anymore, so I ran away. I'd lost all faith in humanity by that point. Thought the whole world was out to get me.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hm, let me guess... Fortunately, the next person you ran into was the director.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 12.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Yeah. For the first time in my life, I was somewhere I felt safe, and I promised myself I'd stay here until the day the group parted ways.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 01.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' The day you hoped would never come... *sigh* How times change.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 13.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Oh, you're finally done? Get your butt over here, there's someone I need to introduce you to. This is our new artistic consultant, Miss Furina.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 02.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' ...Furina? THE Furina? Oh my god! How did you manage to wrangle that!?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Please, the honor is all mine. I was profoundly moved to hear about your troupe and your wonderful director. I just wanted to do something to help.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Same here!
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 03.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Even so, this is just... wow... I'm sorry. I'll try to calm down. Now, where was I...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 04.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Ah yes, the script, of course! Let me give you a rundown of how the story unfolds in my version of the script.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 05.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' I'm sure you're already familiar with the beginning of the story: A little Oceanid decides she wants to become a human, against the wishes of her family.

:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 06.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' She finds love and friendship in the bustling city. But then, disaster strikes...
:<gallery widths=370>
Whither Should the Water Flow Quest Still 2.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 07.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' The people start to notice that all the fresh water in the surrounding area is slowly disappearing. The soil is becoming arid, plants and flowers are withering, and the people begin to panic.
:<gallery widths=370>
Whither Should the Water Flow Quest Still 3.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 08.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' The little Oceanid, Clio, and her lover decide to do something about it, and investigate the truth of the matter together.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 09.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' In the end, they discover that all the waste and pollution created by humans over the years has caused the fresh water to flee the land, as if driven by a consciousness of its own.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 12.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Consciousness? You mean... the water is sentient?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Water as a conscious entity... There's actually quite a few stories that explore this theme.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 10.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Since the little Oceanid is a water spirit, she immediately understands how the water is feeling. She then tells her lover about her true identity, as well as the truth behind the crisis.
:<gallery widths=370>
Whither Should the Water Flow Quest Still 4.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 11.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Her lover accepts her for who she is, and works with her to find a way to bring the water back. However, unbeknownst to them, there were some people eavesdropping when she revealed her secret...
:<gallery widths=370>
Whither Should the Water Flow Quest Still 5.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 12.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' The little Oceanid is accused of being directly responsible for driving the water away, and faces the greatest dilemma of her life...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And then...?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 13.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' In the end, she makes the brave decision to sacrifice herself to save her lover and the rest of humanity...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But didn't they all treat Clio like a villain? Why would she want to save them after that?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 14.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Well, she mainly wanted to save her lover, plus everyone who'd stood up for her.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Through her love for her human partner, she was able to find an even greater love &mdash; one that extended to all of humanity. Surely the biggest strength of Clio's character.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 13.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' There's actually something else that bothers me...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 14.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' You know the protagonist is supposed to represent the director, right? And she never had the chance to become a hero in our world.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 15.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' If we're serious about dedicating this show to her memory, we should make the ending as true-to-life as possible.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 16.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' What about if... the little Oceanid is hounded to death by people who hate her, her lover makes sure her secret never gets out, and humanity continues down the path to extinction?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...That sounds like too cruel of an ending to me. And perhaps a little irresponsible to present to the audience.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 15.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' That ending would be a perfect mirror to Director [[Aurelie]]'s death. Both arbitrary and meaningless.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 16.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' On the day when she went missing, Director Aurelie had instructed us all &mdash; somewhat out the blue &mdash; to leave the Court of Fontaine and wait for her outside the city.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 17.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' We waited and waited at the rendezvous point, but she never came. By the time we returned to the city, she'd disappeared without a trace.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 18.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' We looked for her, the [[Gardemek]]s looked for her, but she was nowhere to be found. Increasingly, all the signs seemed to point to her being the latest victim in the [[Marcel (Fontaine)|serial disappearances case]].
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 17.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' The Director was the kindest soul in the world... Yet she was senslessly sacrificed for the sake of a so-called experiment, by someone who had nothing to do with her at all...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm... But doesn't the way she suddenly told you to leave the city suggest that maybe she had some sense of what was about to happen? It almost seems as if she was moving you to safety.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 19.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' I've been trying to follow up on that ever since, but all my efforts so far have turned up nothing... [[Vilmant]] might know something, but he won't open up to me.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Vilmant? The one who's playing the role of the villain?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 14.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Yeah. He's been overwhelmed by grief &mdash; I think the director's death hit him hardest of all.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 20.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Grief? Hmph, guilt, more like. Also, I... have a hard time imagining that anyone took it harder than me.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 21.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Because... Well, speaking of the play being true-to-life, I... I was deeply, madly in love with Aurelie.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 18.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' What? You... You kept that one quiet...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 22.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' It's time to be upfront with you all. No more keeping secrets from each other, we'll never be able to agree on the ending if we can't be honest about how we feel.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 23.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' I did tell her how I felt once, but she turned me down pretty much straight away.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 24.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' She said that we were all like brothers and sisters to her, and she'd never considered us as potential romantic partners.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 25.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Not that it came as a shock or anything &mdash; it was what I was expecting to hear. So I told her I'd always be there for the troupe, and I'd always be there for her.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 26.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' I said, maybe one day in the future, when everyone's settled in to their own lives and on the up and up, and managing the troupe no longer required her constant attention...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 27.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Well, maybe then she could... reconsider what she really wanted in her life.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 28.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' ...And now, that day will never come.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 lauwick 15.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Oh, Pauleau...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 29.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' So if I'm the one writing this ending, then I'm gonna make sure it does right by Aurelie. I won't let anyone get in the way of that.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 19.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' *sigh* In that case, you have to straighten things out with Vilmant once and for all. Face to face.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 dulphy 20.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' We've all had our differences of opinion over the ending, but those two have never seen eye to eye on anything. One of them has to compromise if we're ever going to reach a final decision.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if that's where we're at, looks like it's time to go visit Vilmant.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Are you ready to face the truth?
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 30.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Honestly? I'm slightly terrified. But for the sake of our final performance, I'll do whatever it takes...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 pauleau 31.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Funny you should ask, though... You really do get what I'm going through right now...
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I certainly do.
:{{A|vo fnnlq002 4 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Come on, everyone. Allons-y.
