==Trivia==
* As mentioned in the [[Gliding Instruction Manual]], José tried playing his lyre while gliding and fell into the wishing well as a result. His gliding license was suspended for five years for reckless gliding and he had to perform community service for three months.
* José gives the introductory quote in [[Diluc]]'s [[Diluc/Lore#Official Introduction|official introduction]], where he likens Diluc to "a fine wine but with too much ice. The first sip tastes heavenly, but drink too much and it gives you brain freeze." For this statement, [[Charles]] temporarily kicked him out of Angel's Share.
