{{lang|'''Reizenbou'''|ja=霊善坊}}<ref name="Redhorn">{{Ref/Weapon|Redhorn Stonethresher}}</ref> was the Great [[Tengu]] of the [[Yougou Tengu]] five hundred years ago, the mentor of the [[Yougou Three]], and the mother of [[Teruyo]]. She was close with the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] and became the kitsune's bodyguard after being beaten in a race. Following her failure to protect the Kitsune Saiguu during the [[cataclysm]], Reizenbou went on a self-imposed exile.

Reizenbou was the original wielder of [[Thundering Pulse]] before she gave it to [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]] as a result of their bet. The [[Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates]] was her final abode.

==Profile==
===Personality===
Reizenbou was rather rambunctious and enjoyed fighting.<ref name="ShiRem">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Shimenawa's Reminiscence}}</ref>

==Story==
At an unknown point after the Great Tengu [[Sasayuri]] died, Reizenbou became the chieftain of the Yougou Tengu. She was presumably close with [[Makoto]] and [[Ei]], as she was bestowed with the bow [[Thundering Pulse]].<ref name="ThunPulse">{{Ref/Weapon|Thundering Pulse}}</ref>

At some point in time, Reizenbou and the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] had a race; while the Kitsune Saiguu won, she suspected that Reizenbou had allowed her win. Following the Kitsune Saiguu's victory, Reizenbou became her bodyguard.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring}}</ref> According to the [[Otogi King|Otogi Kongou Lion King]], the wielder of the [[Redhorn Stonethresher]], Reizenbou was also familiar with him.<ref name="Redhorn" />

Before the [[cataclysm]], Reizenbou served as a mentor for the [[Yougou Three]], a group consisting of [[Asase Hibiki]], [[Kamuna Harunosuke]], and [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]], who traveled to Mt. Yougou to learn the Tengu arts.<ref name="ShiRem" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Narukami Trail}}</ref> Among the techniques she taught them was "true 'magic.'"<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hamayumi|Lore}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas (Quest)}}</ref> During their tutelage with Reizenbou, Asase and Kamuna also became familiar with the Kitsune Saiguu and the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]].

Around the same time, [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]] became her servant in exchange for possession of Thundering Pulse as a result of their bet coming to a draw.<ref name="ThunPulse" /> She taught him Tengu archery, which was apparently a skill she did not teach the Yougou Three seeing as Takamine later taught it to Asase as to not waste his archery skills.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Storm Cage}} description</ref>

Reizenbou gave birth to a daughter, [[Teruyo]], around the time she was mentoring the Yougou Three.<ref name="ShiRem" />

===The Cataclysm===
When the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago struck, causing monsters corrupted with Abyssal powers to rampage across [[Teyvat]], Reizenbou was among those who helped combat the monsters. However, the Kitsune Saiguu eventually lost her life and disappeared. Out of rage at her own inability to prevent the fox envoy's sacrifice, Reizenbou went on a self-imposed exile, leaving Teruyo behind and refusing to emerge before humanity ever again.<ref name="ShiRem" />

At some point presumably around the cataclysm, Reizenbou and the Kitsune Saiguu went to the [[Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates]]. While exploring the ruins under [[Araumi]], Asase and Kamuna found traces of their presence.<ref>Interactible: [[Earth Kitsune Statue#Araumi|Earth Kitsune Statue]] (in front of the Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates)</ref>
