==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Fengtai:''' Welcome to Fengtai General Goods! Everyday items, commemorative jade jewelry... You name it, we stock it!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'm looking at the merchandise...
::'''Fengtai:''' Oh sure, of course! Take your pick!
:{{DIcon}} Jadeware?
::'''Fengtai:''' That is right. We do have a build-to-order jadeware service, but it requires a reservation, and the time required is based on how complicated the design is.
::'''Fengtai:''' You don't choose a piece of jade, it chooses you. Chance encounters often make the best purchases.
::'''Fengtai:''' So it's not a bad thing if you don't find anything you like today...
::{{DIcon}} Why aren't there many jade artisans?
::'''Fengtai:''' Many guests have asked the same question, as did I when I was young.
::'''Fengtai:''' [[Deyin]], my master, told me that one must suffer no distraction when carving a piece of beautiful jade.
::'''Fengtai:''' If an artisan must also sell and promote, then their minds are invaded by such thoughts, and true excellence will elude their work.
::'''Fengtai:''' In Chenyu Vale, the sale and production of jade are completely separate. This allows our artisans to focus on carving.
::'''Fengtai:''' Who knows, there might be an artisan sequestered within any given house you might pass by, meticulously shaping the jade in their hands.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Fengtai:''' Goodbye, please come again!
