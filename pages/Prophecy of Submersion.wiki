==Gameplay Notes==
*Contrary to the description, this Constellation does ''not'' have any effect on [[Frozen]] duration.<ref>Community Document: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10SMEo9XGQQvhNQ2QsTeggynewt8unRYxCGOaJF_qWr4/edit#gid=762498999&range=B111:S112 Mona C1 Freeze]</ref>
*This bonus does not apply in the triggering attack nor from the resulting {{Color|Hydro DMG}} dealt by Illusory Bubble in [[Stellaris Phantasm]] regardless if they were from resulting reactions.
*The buff will apply to all party members.
**In [[Co-Op Mode]], it only applies to the team members of the Mona player.
*In the [[Spiral Abyss]], it is possible for the buff to transfer to the next team in the other chamber if it has not expired.
*This bonus is signified by the {{Hydro}} aura Mona and her teammates gain.
