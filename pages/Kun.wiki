==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kun:''' Greetings. Can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Kun:''' Don't recognize me? I just transferred here from the south wharf.
::'''Kun:''' I'm going to miss my time there. I always found watching the boats going in and out the harbor quite awe-inspiring somehow.
::'''Kun:''' Not so much the cargo ships and fishing boats. I mean more the ones that belong to the [[Crux Fleet]]. I know they are involved in some shady stuff, but...
::'''Kun:''' ...None of that's any of my business really. If everyone above me's happy enough to let it slide, it's hardly my place to be critical.
:{{DIcon}} So, any sights worth seeing in Liyue Harbor?
::'''Kun:''' Oh, are you a traveler from another nation? Then I suggest that you must go and see one of [[Xinyan]]'s performances.
::'''Kun:''' Every time she performs, the ad-hoc stage she uses will burst into flames when the atmosphere reaches its peak!
::'''Kun:''' Well, this did attract the attention of the higher-ups, and they put a stop to her performances in order to avoid any harm coming to members of the public.
::'''Kun:''' But as much as I'm a Millelith, I'm also a loyal fan of hers. So I always try to sneak her some intel, so she can stage performances in the blind spots of our patrols.
::'''Kun:''' Ahem. Don't tell on me to the sergeant! Her music is a great source of joy in my life. To let it be snuffed out would be such a shame!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kun:''' While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail! The Millelith is proud to be at your service.

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kun:''' Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
:'''Kun:''' All of Liyue Harbor is already bustling with excitement around us. It's not often that you'll see the city in such a festive state.
:'''Kun:''' ...But when it comes to Lantern Rite, the Mingxiao Lantern is the moment everyone's waiting for.
:'''Kun:''' On the final day of the Lantern Rite, they'll release the Mingxiao Lantern, built by the efforts of all the people of Liyue, and the lantern will slowly ascend into the night sky. It'll be a moment you won't want to miss.
:'''Kun:''' But I needn't say more. Take a walk around and take in all the festivities for yourself.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing [[The Stars Inscribe the Year's Wishes]])
:'''Kun:''' Hello there, Traveler. I guess you're here to celebrate the Lantern Rite?
:'''Kun:''' Well, what do you think? Quite the lively festival, wasn't it? I mean, especially the fireworks show that Lady Keging organized. Ah, that was one for the history books for sure.
:'''Kun:''' I hope you can enjoy yourself to the fullest. If you need anything, just come to me!

===The Exquisite Night Chimes===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing [[A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune]])
:'''Kun:''' Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
:'''Kun:''' You see, seeing all of Liyue Harbor this lively is quite a rare sight.
:'''Kun:''' And for the finale of this year's Lantern Rite, they'll be holding a musical performance!
:'''Kun:''' It's also said to have something to do with Fontaine's renowned [[Iridescence Tour]]!
:'''Kun:''' I heard that they haven't done a show in a while, so this one can't be missed!

===Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kun:''' Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
:'''Kun:''' You see, seeing all of Liyue Harbor this lively is quite a rare sight.
:'''Kun:''' If it wasn't for the fact that I need to stick to my post, I'd have bought a kite to fly already.
:'''Kun:''' I mean, hearing them talk, you'd know that with that new mechanical propulsion thingamabob, any kite can fly with ease!
:'''Kun:''' ...Hmm. Does that mean that I could fly a kite while working?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Springtime Charms===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kun:''' Ah, Liyue Harbor sure is livelier now that the ceremony's over.
:'''Kun:''' I heard some gossip that the start of this year was an unlucky time, which had something to do with many people falling ill. Even had me feeling nervous back there.
:'''Kun:''' But as it turns out, it wasn't a big deal after all, eh?
:'''Kun:''' I've heard that the ceremony this time was a most important one, requiring in-person attention from skilled adepts of many different specialties. So forget a normal year, the one to come's going to be a blast for sure!
