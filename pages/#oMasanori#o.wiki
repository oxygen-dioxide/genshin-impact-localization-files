{{Lang|'''"Masanori"'''|ja=「公義」|ja_rm="Masanori"}}, previously known as '''Nameless''', is an NPC that can be found in {{Location|Tatarasuna}}.

After completing the {{Quest|Dreams of Sword Art}}, "Masanori" can be fought again any time. His movesets are similar to those of a [[Kairagi: Dancing Thunder]]. However, unlike regular [[Kairagi]], Masanori periodically heals himself and also restores his health to full after his first health bar is depleted.

==Profile==
Nameless is a samurai that trained in the art of the sword at a young age with his friend [[Masanori]]. Despite both of them being ridiculed, they became proficient fighters in the [[Tenryou Commission]] and was promoted to Hatamoto, until a battle at [[Nazuchi Beach]], in which Masanori died. His death drove him insane and he deserted the [[Shogun's Army]]. Becoming a [[Kairagi: Dancing Thunder|Kairagi]], Nameless won every duel until he met the [[Traveler]]. Wondering what he was missing, he believed no one could help him and attacked the Traveler, but to his surprise, he lost the duel. He then realized that they could help him regain his memories, so he sent them off to collect items from places he could vaguely remember, before dueling them again to recover more.

After bringing back wine from [[Matsudaira]], Nameless believed he was originally called "Masanori." After yet another duel, he told them to find his friend's blade from Nazuchi Beach. When they returned with his blade, he went berserk and attacked them on the spot, but the Traveler was able to best him once more. He calmed down and thanked the Traveler, having no more interest in digging into what he suspected would be a painful past, instead offering to be a sparring partner if they chose to so he could see new techniques they acquired and share pointers with them.

The [[Family Letter]], [[Tattered Letter]] and Matsudaira's dialogue reveal that he is actually Kenji Kazumichi. The real Masanori had deserted to the [[Watatsumi Army]] after killing a senior of theirs at some "fateful battle" which shook him to the core. After an argument with Masanori, Kenji presumably slew him during one of the many battles in Nazuchi Beach, driving him insane.

===Appearance===
Nameless takes on the form of a [[Kairagi: Dancing Thunder]].

:'''"Masanori":''' You're here.
:'''"Masanori":''' Shall we spar?
:{{DIcon}} Well then, have at it.
::'''"Masanori":''' Very good. Let us fight.
:;(Proceeds to spar with "Masanori")
:;(If the challenge is completed)
:::'''"Masanori":''' Haha. I am still not your match.
:::'''"Masanori":''' I should probably have expected that. You are ever advancing in skill, and the limits of my nature prevent me from making a similar breakthrough.
:::'''"Masanori":''' Nonetheless, should you learn any new techniques, I would be glad to see them.
:::'''"Masanori":''' Until we meet again, then.

:::'''"Masanori":''' It seems that you have neglected your training.
:::'''"Masanori":''' A single day of sloth will waste ten of a warrior's work. I'm sure you understand this principle well.
:::'''"Masanori":''' Hone yourself further. I do not believe that is all you can do.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to talk.
::'''"Masanori":''' I have forsaken my past. There is nothing to be said between me and this world.
::'''"Masanori":''' If you are looking for someone to chat with, you have come to the wrong person.
::'''"Masanori":''' Kindly leave.

==Trivia==
* The name of his sword {{Lang|Takatsuki Dougire|ja=貴月胴切}} literally means "Noble Moon, Torso Cutting."
** The kanji {{ja|貴月}} literally means "Noble Moon."
*** It can be read as ''Takatsuki'' or ''Kizuki'' as a surname, which could possibly be honoring its former owner or someone who was killed with this sword.
*** It can also be read as ''Kigetsu'', as an uncommon Japanese word, to praise the beautiful tempering pattern ({{w|Hamon (swordsmithing)|''hamon''}}) of the sword. The naming scheme is found in the real sword "Crescent Moon", one of the {{w|Tenka-Goken|five greatest swords of Japan}}.
** {{Lang|''Dougiri''|ja=胴切}} refers to the action of cutting a torso horizontally. The name honors the sharpness of the sword.
<!--*It may also be a reference to the famous samurai [http://www2.harimaya.com/sengoku/html/tati_k.html Tachibana Dousetsu] and his sword "Chidori," meaning "A Thousand Birds." This could be a word play with his surname and the word Ichika, which can be literally translated to "One Flower" or "A Thousand Flowers" in this context. Another note can be "Masanori" being almost unbeatable in battle, even in a drunken state, may referenced Dousetsu's reputation fighting 37 battles while about half of his body was paralyzed.-->
