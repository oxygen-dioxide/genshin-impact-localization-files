:'''Balent:''' Ah, it's you. I'm very grateful for your assistance earlier.
:{{DIcon}} How have you been?
::'''Balent:''' Our most recent inspections have confirmed that the pipes are in good condition. I don't think there's anything to worry about.
::'''Balent:''' The assistants Mr. [[Estienne]] brought us are also very professional. They've been a great help.
::{{DIcon}} I was asking about you, not the pipes.
::'''Balent:''' Oh! I see... Thanks for your concern.
::'''Balent:''' After that incident, I started studying some basic self-defense in my time off. So now, even if I run into trouble while I'm working, I should be able to escape at least.
::'''Balent:''' There are some risks associated with working out here. It would be a good idea to include some fitness and self-defense skills in our staff training from now on.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, nothing. Bye.
::'''Balent:''' Have a safe journey.
