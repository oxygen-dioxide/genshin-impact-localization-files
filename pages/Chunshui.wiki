{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Chunshui:''' Hello. Would you like to join me in prayer to the Anemo Archon, Barbatos?
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death... ''(Unlocked after completing "[[Rite of Descension]]")
::'''Chunshui:''' I heard something about that too...
::'''Chunshui:''' It may be because I pray to the Anemo Archon regularly... But I sensed bad tidings on the winds a long time ago.
::'''Chunshui:''' Maybe it was selfish of me only to pray for my husband's safety...
::'''Chunshui:''' Because now, all of Liyue's people need divine protection.
:{{DIcon}} You worship the Anemo Archon?
::'''Chunshui:''' ...I suppose you rarely meet locals of Liyue who worship the Anemo Archon?
::'''Chunshui:''' ...The reason I do is because my husband is a sailor.
::'''Chunshui:''' Although it is tradition in Liyue to worship the Geo Archon, it's the wind that ultimately decides whether a ship at sea will return home safely or not. Wouldn't you say?
::'''Chunshui:''' ...Also, I don't care if he makes any money or not. All I want is to have him back safe and sound.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} My best wishes to him.
:::'''Chunshui:''' Thank you, and mine to you... If you don't mind, please take this.
:::'''Chunshui:''' This is called a Windwheel Aster. I asked a friend to bring one back from Mondstadt for me.
:::'''Chunshui:''' There, this plant symbolizes the "visible winds." I hope it can keep my husband safe at sea.
:::'''Chunshui:''' You are a good person. I hope that you, too, may be blessed be<!--sic--> the wind.
::;(Obtain [[Windwheel Aster]] ×5)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Chunshui:''' *sigh* Anemo or not... any god will do as long as they can keep my husband safe...
