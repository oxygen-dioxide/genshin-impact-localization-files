'''The Viparyas of Vanarana''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Sumeru]]. It involves locating and completing the puzzles of 12 [[Nursery|Nurseries]] to obtain [[Vasmrti]]s, and then planting the Vasmrtis in the [[Vanarana Nursery|special nursery of Vanarana]].

The Vasmrtis can be planted upon completing the {{Quest|Sprouting Seedlings}}, but progression requires completing the {{Quest|Festival Utsava}} and waiting for a [[Daily Reset]]. After the daily reset, talking to [[Arakara]] and [[Aranakula]] grants the {{Achievement|When the Dreams Bloom}}.

==Steps==
# Complete the puzzles of all 12 [[Nursery|Nurseries]]
#* See the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=396 Teyvat Interactive Map] for specific locations.
# Plant the [[Vasmrti]] in the garden in Vanarana
#* Note that 1 Vasmrti is planted during ''Sprouting Seedlings'', so there will be 13 Viparyas in total.

== Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Arakara or Aranakula after the [[Viparyas]] have grown)
:'''Aranakula:''' Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon, thank you. Now Viparyas is growing across the gardens in Vanarana.
:'''Arakara:''' The Viparyas here are happy. So Arakara is happy too.
:'''Aranakula:''' Festival Utsava is over. Before the Golden Nara leaves Vanarana...
:{{Black Screen|You obtain a Viparyas.}}
:'''Aranakula:''' I gave the happy Viparyas to the Golden Nara. Hope Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon will be happy too. The Viparyas doesn't wither, but...
:'''Arakara:''' Remember to talk to it occasionally. Better play music for it.
:'''Aranakula:''' The land and Aranara will not forget. Hope Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon will not forget...

;(Talk to Arakara or Aranakula again)
:'''Aranakula:''' This feels just like the time Nara Varuna celebrated Festival Utsava with Aranara all over again... Aranakula hasn't been so happy in a very long time, Nara {{Traveler}}. *sob*
:'''Arakara:''' Viparyas hate tears. Festival Utsava is a happy festival. Aranakula will play a happy song for Viparyas!

;(Upon entering the nursery in the "real" Vanarana)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... So many [[Sweet Flower]]s! Maybe because we gathered a lot of Vasmrti and nurtured a lot of Viparyas, these flowers are blooming here too?
