'''''The Viparyas of Vanarana''''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Sumeru]]. It involves locating and completing the puzzles of 12 [[Nursery|Nurseries]] to obtain [[Vasmrti]]s, and then planting the Vasmrtis in the special nursery of [[Vanarana]].

The Vasmrtis can be planted upon completing the ''[[Sprouting Seedlings]]'' World Quest, but progression requires completing the ''[[Festival Utsava]]'' World Quest and waiting for a [[Daily Reset]]. After the daily reset, talking to [[Arakara]] and [[Aranakula]] grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[When the Dreams Bloom]]''.

==Procedure==
#Complete the puzzles of all 12 [[Nursery|Nurseries]]
#*See the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=396 Teyvat Interactive Map] for specific locations.
#Plant the [[Vasmrti]] in the garden in Vanarana

== Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Arakara or Aranakula after the [[Viparyas]] have grown)
:'''Aranakula:''' Nara (Traveler) and Paimon, thank you. Now Viparyas is growing across the gardens in Vanarana.
:'''Arakara:''' The Viparyas here are happy. So Arakara is happy too.
:'''Aranakula:''' Festival Utsava is over. Before the Golden Nara leaves Vanarana...

:'''You obtain a Viparyas.'''

:'''Aranakula:''' I gave the happy Viparyas to the Golden Nara. Hope Nara (Traveler) and Paimon will be happy too. The Viparyas doesn't wither, but...
:'''Arakara:''' Remember to talk to it occasionally. Better play music for it.
:'''Aranakula:''' The land and Aranara will not forget. Hope Nara (Traveler) and Paimon will not forget...

;(Talk to Arakara or Aranakula again)
:'''Aranakula:''' This feels just like the time Nara Varuna celebrated Festival Utsava with Aranara all over again... Aranakula hasn't been so happy in a very long time, Nara (Traveler). *sob*
:'''Arakara:''' Viparyas hate tears. Festival Utsava is a happy festival. Aranakula will play a happy song for Viparyas!

;(Upon entering the nursery in the "real" Vanarana)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... So many [[Sweet Flower]]s! Maybe because we gathered a lot of Vasmrti and nurtured a lot of Viparyas, these flowers are blooming here too?
