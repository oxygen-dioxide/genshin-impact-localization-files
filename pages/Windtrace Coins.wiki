|description  = The currency that is awarded for participating in [[Windtrace]].<br />The "background settings" of this same game will change in different areas. Though it is still a game of chase-and-catch, the fleeing party are named the "Rebels" in [[Mondstadt]], while their pursuer is the "Hunter," symbols both of the ancient resistance and oppression.<br />Of course, the children of Mondstadt know well that this is just a game, and no true sense of enmity emerges as they play.
