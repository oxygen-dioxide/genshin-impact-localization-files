'''Lumentorches''' (''unofficial name'') are objects found in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. When approached with the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]] equipped, they will become lit as long as there is energy remaining in the Lumenstone Adjuvant. They can also be activated by the Lumenstone Adjuvant's Blooming Light or a nearby [[Luminous Seelie]]. Lumentorches are usually found in groups, if an entire group of Lumentorches are lit, a chest will be unlocked.
