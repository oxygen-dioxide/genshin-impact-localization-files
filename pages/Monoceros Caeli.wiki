== Trivia ==

* During the fight with the All-Devouring Narwhal (assumed to be Monoceros Caeli itself, judging on the vision in the Fontaine Archon Quest), most of its attacks recreate the shape of Monoceros Caeli's constellation, signifying a potential connection to Childe. This is further backed up by the fact that the All-Devouring Narwhal greatly resembles Monoceros Caeli on a near-identical scale.
** Even its title, Narwhal of the Sky, hints at a clear reference to the fact the All-Devouring Narwhal is capable of flying and floating, creating rifts via the abyssal energy it possesses.
