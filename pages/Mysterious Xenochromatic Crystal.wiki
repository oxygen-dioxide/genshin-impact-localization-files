==Gameplay Notes==
* There can only be one instance of it in the inventory at any time, and only one crystal can be obtained per day. Defeating the Local Legends again will not grant a second item until the first one has been sold to Pitot.
** Selling three of them to Pitot will grant the player the {{Achievement|A World Yet to Be Disenchanted}}.
