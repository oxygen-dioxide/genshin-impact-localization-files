|description  = This device, developed by alchemist Hajanad, is cleverly designed with an internal chamber capable of withstanding high pressure and high temperature to withstand the explosion from the "remelting effect". The special valve can be opened automatically at the right time to release the fully mixed medicament smoke and provide the user with assistance in combat. However, judging from some of its details, this experiment seems to be suffering from a shortage of funds. Hajanad's research doesn't seem to be all that well-funded...
