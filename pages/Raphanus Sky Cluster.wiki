{{Description|"A radish a day keeps trouble away! ... Oh, this isn't about a radish's medical properties, exactly, but it does have some health benefits, yeah!}}
'''Raphanus Sky Cluster''' is [[Yaoyao]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|1}}
** This particle generation has a cooldown of '''1.5''' seconds.
* Yuegui: Throwing Mode throws 1 radish every second for a total of 10 radishes over the full duration.
* Yuegui randomly selects targets within a cylindrical targeting zone with a radius of '''8&nbsp;m''' and a height of '''10&nbsp;m'''.
* When radish explosions hit characters, they can trigger certain on-hit effects, such as that of [[Beidou]]'s [[Stunning Revenge|4th Constellation Level]] and [[Thoma]]'s [[A Comrade's Duty|1st Constellation Level]].
* {{Talent Note|snapshot|White Jade Radish DMG|character=Yaoyao}}
* The radishes targeted at characters and enemies are homing.
* When the radishes land, hit a character, or hit an enemy, they make a noise that can be heard by enemies and [[wildlife]] and may therefore [[startle]] them.
