==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You discover a Yumkasaurus standing in the way of some treasure. Can you find a way to make it leave...?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to the Strange Yumkasaurus)
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! There's treasure in the cave, but this fella here has totally blocked off the entrance, and won't move at all...
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' Arrooo?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah? What's wrong?
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' Arrooo...
:'''Paimon:''' Bah, Paimon didn't understand that at all! {{Little One}}, can you tell what this Yumkasaur is trying to say?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehrrr?
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' ?
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like that didn't work... *sigh* And even if they could understand each other, it's not like we could talk with {{Little One}} either.
:'''Paimon:''' If only we had a way to understand what was being said, then maybe we could give it what it wants and make it move out of the way.

;(Talk to the Strange Yumkasaurus again, optional)
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' Arrooo?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, is there something you want? ...If only we had a way to know what that is...

;(Talk to the Strange Yumkasaurus while [[indwelling]] a Yumkasaurus)
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' Want to eat...
:{{DIcon}} You want to eat?
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' Flat stomach, stomach, so hot...
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' Want to eat&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' What were you mumbling about just now?
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' *grumble*
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, could it be you're really hungry?
:'''Paimon:''' A [[Saurian]] here all by itself, and no master in sight... It probably isn't even able to find its own food...
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, {{Traveler}}, let's go help find it some food!
:'''Paimon:''' Once it gets full and moves out of the way, the treasure will be all ours! Hehe...
:{{DIcon}} What should we feed it, though?
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon think for a sec! Saurians here tend to eat a bit of everything, and Paimon isn't sure what Yumkasaurs eat... Looking at its color, it feels kinda like it should eat leaves and grass and that kinda thing...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's find one of those and give it a try first! Hungry bellies tend not to be too picky!

;(Talk to the Strange Yumkasaurus again while indwelling, optional)
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' Remember now... *gurgle* Want to eat... Meaty food...

;(Talk to the Strange Yumkasaurus again)
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' Arroo arroo... *stomach rumbling*
:;(Opens submission menu)

;(Submit the wrong food, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Do you not like it...? It won't touch it...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey now, beggars aren't supposed to be this choosy... Hmm, just what kind of food might it like?

;(Submit {{Item|Raw Meat|x=1}}, {{Item|Fish|x=1}}, {{Item|Fowl|x=1}}, {{Item|Shrimp Meat|x=1}}, {{Item|Eel Meat|x=1}}, {{Item|Bacon|x=1}}, {{Item|Ham|x=1}}, {{Item|Smoked Fowl|x=1}}, or {{Item|Sausage|x=1}})
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Hehe, sure looks good. It'll definitely like it!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:{{Black Screen|The Yumkasaur downs the food in front of it in a flash.<br>You almost don't even manage to see just how the feat was accomplished...}}
:'''Paimon:''' L&mdash;Look at the food... It's vanishing!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, you've got competition.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, what're you trying to say? Paimon's a true gourmet, she's very particular about food, and would never just chow down like that... How can you truly enjoy your food if you just vacuum it up?
:{{DIcon}} Just one serving... doesn't seem to be enough.
::'''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;Yeah! Paimon couldn't tell, but this little guy's a real "Megasnackasaurus"... It's a good thing {{Little One}} can't eat that much...
:'''Paimon:''' Still, maybe the poor thing was just starving! Poor fella, let's give it another serving.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Arawrrr...
:'''Paimon:''' Does {{Little One}} also want to eat? Let's feed this other Sauropal first, and then we'll fix you up something delicious!
:{{Black Screen|The hungry Saurian eats everything you lay out in a single gulp.<br>You blink, as though the scene seemed to unfold twice...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, that should at least fill your tummy&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Wait a sec, how are you sitting down again? Is two servings not enough!?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, and just going to sleep right in front of the cave after eating? Doesn't seem remotely interested in getting out of the way, either!
:'''Paimon:''' What should we do, {{Traveler}}? Paimon doesn't get this guy... Even if you wanna take a nap after eating, at least don't block the way!
:{{DIcon}} I don't think it ever agreed to get out of the way, though.
:{{DIcon}} Definitely feels like we've been had.
:'''Paimon:''' Grraaaah! And it ate so much of our food too...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Even {{Little One}} can't stand to watch! C'mon, {{Traveler}}, we've gotta try and wake it up!

;(Talk to the Strange Yumkasaurus, optional)
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' *snoring* *snoring*
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, this Saurian's sleeping unreasonably soundly... Guess it's a layabout on top of being a greedy-guts.

;(Talk to the Strange Yumkasaurus while indwelling)
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' *snoring*... He's right. Just need block cave... *snoring*... Then can eat meaty food...
:'''Strange Yumkasaurus:''' (The Yumkasaur falls into a deep sleep. It doesn't seem like you'll be able to wake it up.)
:'''Paimon:''' Ehh, it won't wake up? Ugh, so annoying! D'you think it's just pretending to be asleep?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehrrr?
:{{DIcon}} It does seem to actually be asleep...
::{{DIcon}} (You relate the contents of the sleep-talk...)
:{{DIcon}} And sleeptalking, though...
::{{DIcon}} (You relate the contents of the sleep-talk...)
:'''Paimon:''' Are you saying it's intentionally blocking the way just to get food, cheating people out of their grub... Ugh. We fell for it hook, line, and sinker...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! But if that's how things are, then we don't have to play nice!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's just have {{Little One}} tunnel over and get to that chest!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' If it's gonna take the low road, we can't be expected to play fair either!

;(Interact with Little One)
:{{DIcon}} Let's go!
:;(Little One tunnels over to the chest and brings it out of the cave)

;(Open the chest)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, well done! Now let's see what goodies are hiding in the chest!
:'''Paimon:''' Ah? There's nothing at all? Just a note?
::{{Readable|title=Note Left Inside a Treasure Chest
|text=<!--
-->As of writing this note, I have already been laid low by serious illness. Alas, [[Wayob]] above, this too is my punishment.<br><!--
-->To accumulate wealth, I took advantage of all the information I had access to as a courier and cheated many people.<br><!--
-->In the end, after the incident happened, I lost my job as a courier, and all the [[Mora]] I swindled became restitution, and I even became gravely ill... Ah me, all I can say is that this punishment is agony... But even so, I still have things I can't get off my mind...<br><!--
-->And that is the Yumkasaur who never left my side, my companion.<br><!--
-->Alas, I do not have long to live.<br><!--
-->I stole this chest. It is regrettable, but I had no choice... All I could do was have it guard this empty chest.<br><!--
-->I hoped that, should the chest grab the attention of kind passersby, they might feed my companion something... help it live on. That's enough.<br><!--
-->I know you must feel cheated right now. You might even be furious.<br><!--
-->You can insult me however you like, because I really am a despicable bastard, a rat skulking in the shadows of the sewers, scum that isn't fit for the tribe, BUT! Do not tear up this note, and do not move the chest, I beg of you!<br><!--
-->By the way, if you're willing, you can leave something in the chest so that the next person to open it won't feel cheated. Both I and my Saurian will be most grateful to you...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so the one who left the note was its actual master? So we weren't tricked by the Saurian, but by its master?
:{{DIcon}} Totally irresponsible.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Even if he was really sick, how could he just leave his Yumkasaur in a place like this!?
::'''Paimon:''' And he even wanted to use people's greed to... No, wait, he wanted to take advantage of people's empathy for the Saurian...
:{{DIcon}} So, those who eat too much are destined to be abandoned by their friends...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't even joke about things like that! Besides, the Saurian is innocent in all this, maybe it's just waiting here for its master to return, which is why it refuses to move...
:'''Paimon:''' *sigh* Anyway, it's not like we can just let it stay here tricking people out of their food. Let's go find the [[Wayna|Chief]] of the [[Scions of the Canopy]] and tell him about this.
:{{Black Screen|You explain the situation to Wayna, chief of the Scions of the Canopy, and bring him over.}}
:'''Wayna:''' Oh dear, I had a hunch about this when you came looking for me...
:'''Wayna:''' Who'd have thought it was that scoundrel that left behind this creature...
:{{DIcon}} That scoundrel?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrawr?
:'''Wayna:''' He was one who did wrong, then in fear of punishment, left the tribe of his own accord.
:'''Wayna:''' But I see no good in divulging the offender's name. Perhaps he himself was well aware that what he did was no good thing. See &mdash; he didn't even leave his name at the end of this letter.
:{{DIcon}} So his Saurian chose to join him...
:'''Wayna:''' No, we cannot say that it "chose" to do so. Saurians are simple creatures that cannot easily distinguish right from wrong. Most of the time, they simply follow their emotions and trust their companions.
:'''Wayna:''' ...As I suspected, at the core, he hasn't changed. Whatever small wits he has he employs towards devising tricks to deceive others, even his own Saurian.
:'''Wayna:''' We will send people to feed this Yumkasaurus on a regular basis. It is a child of the tribe, after all...
:'''Wayna:''' As for that scoundrel... *sigh* It is a tragic ending indeed, but I refuse to sympathize with him. People should be held responsible for their actions.
