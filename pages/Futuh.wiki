==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Futuh:''' Mold's going to grow on my head if this goes on...
:{{DIcon}} Mold...
::'''Futuh:''' No kidding. Even sand can grow mushrooms if it's surrounded by this damp and sticky air every day!
::'''Futuh:''' I just want to finish this, get my payment, and go sunbathing in the desert...
::{{DIcon}} About the desert...
::'''Futuh:''' Oh, I didn't mean that I actually plan to return to that lousy desert, I meant Aaru Village on the desert's border.
::'''Futuh:''' I heard from the village elders that [[Aaru Village]] used to be a part of King Deshret's Citadel! How amazing!
::'''Futuh:''' If you think about it, Aaru Village may be in the desert, but life is pretty nice there. You don't have to endure wet weather, and you can go shopping at [[Caravan Ribat]] too.
::'''Futuh:''' You probably won't make much money there, but you'll find everything else in that place pretty neat.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Futuh:''' See you... I really hope I can leave soon...
