{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Takashi for the first time, without trying to open the chests)
:'''Takashi:''' Hmm? Are you a traveler? Haha, you've come at a good time. I have some good news for you.
:{{DIcon}} Does it involve these treasure chests?
:'''Takashi:''' That's right, it's the treasure chests.
:'''Takashi:''' They're filled with all kinds of treasures, carefully gathered by me.
:'''Takashi:''' For just a little something in return, you can open the chests and get your hands on the treasures inside.
:{{DIcon}} You want Mora?
::'''Takashi:''' Hahaha, actually, I don't want any Mora.
:{{DIcon}} What would you like, then?
:'''Takashi:''' What I want is a kind of conch.
:'''Takashi:''' You should be able to find plenty of them around the beach.
:'''Takashi:''' If you want to open the treasure chests and get your hands on what's inside, bring me some of those conches in exchange.
:'''Takashi:''' But... I'm not going to tell you what's inside. What treasures you end up with will come down to how lucky you are.
:'''Takashi:''' What do you think? If you want to open these treasure chests, just hand me some conches.

;(Upon trying to open the chests without interacting with Takashi first)
:'''Takashi:''' Whoa there, wait a second. You can't just open these chests as you please.
:{{DIcon}} Are these your chests?
::'''Takashi:''' Of course. I placed them here specifically.
:{{DIcon}} What's inside?
:'''Takashi:''' They're filled with all kinds of treasures, carefully gathered by me.
:'''Takashi:''' If you want to open them, that can be arranged... However, first, you have to give me something in exchange.
:{{DIcon}} You want Mora?
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} What would you like, then?
:;(Same as above)
----
;(Talk to Takashi again)
:'''Takashi:''' How's it going? Have you got some conches for me?
;(Give [[Mysterious Conch]] ×3)
:'''Takashi:''' Nice one! These are just the kind of conches I wanted. Go ahead, pick a treasure chest and open it.
:{{DIcon}} ...Only one chest?
:{{DIcon}} Can't I open all of them?
:'''Takashi:''' Sorry, these chests are one at a time, I'm afraid.
:'''Takashi:''' Okay, go ahead and take your pick. Best of luck, hehe.

;(Talk to Takashi again without opening any chest)
:'''Takashi:''' Go pick a treasure chest and open it. I wish you the best of luck.
----
;(After opening a chest and approaching Takashi again)
:'''Takashi:''' I take it you've opened one of the chests? Hahaha, I hope you got lucky.
:{{DIcon}} So you're collecting these conches?
:'''Takashi:''' Bingo. Yes, I am collecting them.
:'''Takashi:''' But I can't tell you why for now.
:{{DIcon}} Is there something special about them?
::'''Takashi:''' From a business point of view, there most certainly is.
::'''Takashi:''' "Conches that were once influenced by Tatarigami"... Hahaha, they're sure to fetch a good price!
::'''Takashi:''' Ahem! Anyway, you provide me with conches, I provide you with chests. Got it?
:{{DIcon}} You're so suspicious...
::'''Takashi:''' They're just conches for goodness' sake. Don't be so paranoid.
:'''Takashi:''' Anyway, that's your opportunity this time around used up.
:'''Takashi:''' If you want to open another treasure chest, come back with some more conches later on.

===Normal Dialogue===
:'''Takashi:''' Hmm? Is something the matter?
:{{DIcon}} I want to open a chest. ''(Only available if a chest has not been opened that day)''
::'''Takashi:''' As long as you've got some conches for me, you're free to take your pick.
:{{DIcon}} What are you collecting these conches for?
::'''Takashi:''' Hehehe, well... to do some business, of course.
::'''Takashi:''' "Conches that were once influenced by [[Tatarigami]]"... Hahaha, they're sure to fetch a good price!
::'''Takashi:''' Ahem! Anyway, you provide me with conches, I provide you with chests. Got it?
:{{DIcon}} This house looks familiar...
::'''Takashi:''' Is that so? {{sic|Wow...that's}} quite a coincidence, hahaha.
::'''Takashi:''' But even if the house looks the same, the business I do here is unique.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Takashi:''' Bye for now, then. Don't forget: conches for chests, conches for chests, hahaha.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
*The Traveler can remark "This house looks familiar," and indeed, Takashi's house is similar to the one [[Granny Chu]] is found in near [[Yaoguang Shoal]], [[Liyue]].
*The Inazuma [[Treasure Compass]] picks up the three Chests in Takashi's hut (every day, after server reset) regardless if the player has already obtained the weapon blueprint.
