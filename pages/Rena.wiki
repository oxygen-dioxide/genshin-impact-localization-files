:'''Rena:''' Machines make work easier, but there's something rather boring about them.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Rena/The Joys and Woes of Automation|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Rena:''' That was an interesting game! You're really good at this!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Rena:''' Aww! I should have used a better strategy...
:{{DIcon}} Wanna chat?
::'''Rena:''' Sure, but where should we start...?
::'''Rena:''' I was just thinking that I should meet up with a friend at the [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]] on my off day &mdash; we can watch an opera or a trial, either is fine with me.
::'''Rena:''' I've been on duty at the harbor lately, and I've been inspecting machines on the regular, day in and day out &mdash; nothing special.
::'''Rena:''' But thinking about it a different way, boring work might be meaningless, but at least it's safe.
::'''Rena:''' If I were still dispatched to the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] for further studies in mechanical knowledge, I might no longer have legs to touch land, you know?
:{{DIcon}} What if I want to take a boat to the [[Court of Fontaine]]...
::'''Rena:''' Ah, you speak of the [[aquabus]]es that travel along Fontaine's waterways, eh?
::'''Rena:''' This is the starting point of the Clementine Line, which heads from Romaritime Harbor to the Court of Fontaine.
::'''Rena:''' If you want to take one of those boats to the Court, just take a seat on that long bench, and one will arrive shortly.
::'''Rena:''' The [[Aeval|Melusine tour guide]] on board will introduce you to... some assorted trivia, so stay tuned.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Rena:''' Take care!
