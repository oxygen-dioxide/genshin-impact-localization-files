==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Adel:''' That's the way young people should be. Sails unfurled, revved up, ready to go and all that, just like these boats...
:{{DIcon}} Are you gazing at the sea?
::'''Adel:''' At the sea? No, no... I'm an officer of the law, from the [[Akademiya]]. Everyone calls me Master Adel.
::'''Adel:''' Simply put, it is the job of the Navbed to inspect a port's comings and goings. I inspect them in turn.
::'''Adel:''' You can think of me as their superior.
::{{DIcon}} But you were clearly gazing out to sea...
:::'''Adel:''' *cough* I was simply keeping an eye on the ships out at sea. Gotta make sure the Navbed aren't slacking off and all.
:::'''Adel:''' Don't you take me for some skiving old man, now!
:{{DIcon}} Youngsters heading out to sea?
::'''Adel:''' Indeed! I mean, look at them, all fired up like that.
::'''Adel:''' When I was a lad, I too had the sea as my home, and I sailed everywhere on a patrol boat, even up to the border with [[Natlan]]. I'd go out there again if I could!
::{{DIcon}} Have you been to Natlan?
:::'''Adel:''' Natlan's youths are as energetic as our own... No, in fact, I'd call what they have something else.
:::'''Adel:''' It's almost as if... their souls were forged for battle from birth.
:::'''Adel:''' Don't mistake my meaning, they aren't barbarians! On the contrary, they love street graffiti, showing off and comparing fashionable trinkets...
:::'''Adel:''' It's a colorful, contradictory, charming place.
:::'''Adel:''' Come to think of it, I'm practically getting younger over here, and yet our head administrator's always using "you need more rest" as an excuse to leave me idle.
:::'''Adel:''' *cough*...
:{{DIcon}} I'll be off now.
::'''Adel:''' Haha, guess my only true companions are the wind and waves, eh?
