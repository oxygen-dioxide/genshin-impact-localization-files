==Profile==
He is described as "the sickly brother" out of his trio of siblings.

Like other characters in the Mirage (besides Idyia), the blue-haired Haddo is a [[Hydro Eidolon]] replica of a human from Teyvat that once visited Mirage and then left it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the Bottle}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Like his brothers, Haddo has watery-blue hair, glowing blue eyes, and wears an [[Adventurers' Guild]] uniform. His hair is slightly longer than his brothers' and he has wrinkles under his eyes.
