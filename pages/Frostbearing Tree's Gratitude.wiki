==Crimson Agate==

{{Main|Crimson Agate}}
Only 80 [[Crimson Agate]]s can be found in [[Dragonspine]]. They are obtained by finding them in the open world, chests, and after defeating some [[Time Trial Challenge]]s. Others can be found by revealing certain secrets.

The 80th [[Crimson Agate]] is obtained by feeding the foxes from the [[Lost in the Snow]] World Quest. After feeding the foxes for 5 days a Precious Chest will appear on the 6th day, Travelers will receive a [[Crimson Agate]] and earn the hidden ''Untellable Tale'' achievement upon opening the chest.

Travelers may complete [[Crimson Wish]] quests to obtain more [[Crimson Agate]]s to offer to the Frostbearing Tree.

==Crimson Wish==
{{Main|Crimson Wish}}
In addition to the rewards listed above, once the Frostbearing Tree has reached Lv. 8, Travelers will also unlock [[Crimson Wish]]. Five new [[Crimson Wish]] quests will become available every Monday and Friday, which can be completed to receive [[Crimson Agate]].

[[Crimson Wish]] will no longer refresh once the Frostbearing Tree has reached its max level.
