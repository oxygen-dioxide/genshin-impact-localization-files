==Steps==
# Defeat the Ruin Drakes<!--"Defeat the Ruin Drake(s)" for Armin's request-->

==Request Details==
{{Quest Description|Ruin Drakes are raging...}}
===Request from Armin===
Help Needed:<br>
Researches returning from outdoors have reported the {{Color|buzzword|Ruin Drakes}} have shown up {{Color|buzzword|west of Sumeru City}}.<br>
If I remember this correct, the [[Aranara]] do appear there.<br>
If the Ruin Drakes are allowed to do as they please there, the Aranara's lives will surely be disrupted. Could someone get rid of them, please?

===Request from Baharak===
Help Needed:<br>
Roaming the outdoors, doing battle against fierce beasts, seeing wondrous sights... Such is the romance of being an adventurer.<br>
Still, the {{Color|buzzword|Ruin Drakes}} are just way too much. How are we supposed get away from one without serious incident, let alone beat it?<br>
The last one I saw was not all that far from {{Color|buzzword|Caravan Ribat}}. I was lucky enough to see it from afar and flee early, hence saving my life.<br>Such threats to public safety should be dealt with by the professional Corps of Thirty, I reckon!

==Enemies==
===Request from Armin===
{{Enemy List|Ruin Drake: Earthguard*2}}

===Request from Baharak===
{{Enemy List|Ruin Drake: Earthguard*2}}
