==Profile==
Like other characters in the [[Veluriyam Mirage]] (besides [[Idyia]]), the blue-haired Chatillon that the Traveler meets is a [[Hydro Eidolon]] replica of a human from Teyvat that once visited the Veluriyam Mirage and then left it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the Bottle}}</ref>

The real Chatillon was an engineer who worked on his Crococannon based on naval battles. During the [[Spino Doubleblaster]] event, it was revealed that he has already passed away.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Brest|s=1}}</ref> Despite that, [[Brest]], an engineer, has taken his blueprints of the Crococannon for her project.

===Appearance===
Like other characters in the Mirage, Chatillon has watery-blue hair and glowing blue eyes. He wears typical Fontaine male attire with a hat.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chatillon:''' Distinguished guests, would you like to play [[Secret Summer Paradise/Spino Blaster|Spino Blaster]] now?
:{{DIcon|Spino Blaster}} Let's play Spino Blaster!
::'''Chatillon:''' No problem! Please, blast away to your heart's content!
:{{DIcon}} This game is pretty fun!
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! We imagined we were just like... gunners on a huge battleship! We were unleashing salvo after salvo, those targets didn't stand a chance!
::'''Paimon:''' But now that Paimon thinks about it... do real ship gunners have to aim at so many targets in such a short time, too? That's really tough...
::'''Chatillon:''' Precisely so! Now you understand the original inspiration behind the game!
::'''Chatillon:''' Shells don't fly in a straight line but arcs. Gunners must raise the cannon to hit faraway targets...
::'''Chatillon:''' At the same time, the ship will be rocking on the waves, so the gunner must adjust the cannon vertically to compensate for the pitch and roll.
::'''Chatillon:''' For all of those reasons, gunners must be extremely proficient in determining the proper elevation of the cannon barrel in order to be able to properly aim in all situations.
::'''Chatillon:''' Of course, it's also essential to learn how to lead properly in order to hit fast-moving targets. The faster the target and the slower the shell, the more difficult it is to predict how much to lead.
::'''Chatillon:''' That's why I invented the Crocomorph Vortex-Based Crocodilian-Armored Heavy Naval Battleship-Style Water Blasting Training Cannon! The speed and cost of ammo are both quite low.
::'''Chatillon:''' By placing the cannon on a rocking, floating platform and using balloon targets, superb gunners can be quickly trained, greatly increasing the battle prowess of the entire fleet!
::{{DIcon}} Training?
::{{DIcon}} Battle?
::'''Paimon:''' So this game is actually a project to train gunners!? Paimon smells a new scent in the air... and it's gunpowder!
::'''Paimon:''' If Idyia found out there's such a military project in Veluriyam Mirage... wouldn't she feel unsafe?
::'''Chatillon:''' Relax! Lady Idyia knows all about this. I don't plan to change Veluriyam Mirage into anything resembling a battlefield.
::'''Chatillon:''' Pay attention to my words! I said it was my "original" inspiration, and now it's "recreational" and not "training."
::'''Chatillon:''' Far as I can tell... Fontaine's fleet doesn't need me anymore. Or rather, Fontaine has no intention to ever form another fleet like that.
::'''Chatillon:''' My invention has no other purpose, so it might as well be used for something fun. At least it will bring people some happiness.
::{{DIcon}} I guess that's okay...
::{{DIcon}} That's reassuring...
::'''Paimon:''' Why do you sound so dejected? Did talking about Fontaine's fleet remind you of anything unpleasant?
::'''Chatillon:''' Haha, nothing like that! I don't want to spoil the mood!
::'''Chatillon:''' Lady Idyia gave me a precious opportunity that allows me to keep doing what I do best. As long as you're happy, I'm happy!
::'''Chatillon:''' The work I talked about is all in the past! Just forget it, focus on enjoying yourself and the Crococannon!
:{{DIcon}} I think I can go a few more rounds...
::'''Chatillon:''' Wonderful, seems like this game has captured your interest!
::'''Chatillon:''' The basic idea is simply for you to enjoy yourself, so it isn't very difficult yet...
::'''Chatillon:''' But if you get good at it and feel ready for a challenge, just be patient. I'll add some new wrinkles and twists to it as soon as possible!
:{{DIcon}} Why don't we talk about your story?
::'''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, Paimon is curious about your past too... Why did you think about making a game out of water cannons?
::'''Chatillon:''' Oh, that's simple! My old job was related to cannons.
::'''Chatillon:''' A very long time ago, I was a weapon engineer for Fontaine's fleet. My wife and daughter were both excellent gunners serving on the flagship.
::'''Chatillon:''' You could say my whole family is quite familiar with cannons!
::'''Chatillon:''' My wife and daughter often gave me firsthand feedback. Thanks to their expertise, I became an outstanding engineer, and was elevated to work on some impressive projects.
::'''Chatillon:''' I was often away from home testing weapons. Incidentally, the desert has a lot of empty spaces to test cannons and shells, so I became a frequent visitor.
::'''Chatillon:''' However, in one field test, we neglected to store the shells and detonators separately, and there was a massive explosion...
::'''Chatillon:''' The team suffered grievous losses. I was tossed away like a ragdoll, and I count myself lucky to have survived, though I laid in that forsaken desert in a coma for days!
::'''Paimon:''' T&mdash;That's horrifying!
::{{DIcon}} Your tale of tragedy has moved me to tears...
::{{DIcon}} But it's a good thing you survived.
::'''Chatillon:''' Yeah! So, remember, kids: safety first when handling explosives, always!
::'''Chatillon:''' After that, I dragged my battered body, tracking down my injured colleagues with great difficulty, but we were lost in the desert and had to stay put for the rescue.
::'''Chatillon:''' And just like that, we were forced to live in the desert. I don't know how long we survived like that, but rescue never came. After we exhausted our supplies, we thought we were done for...
::'''Chatillon:''' Luckily, we stumbled across Lady Idyia! She invited us to her new home: the Veluriyam Mirage you're in now. Compared to the desert, it's a much more hospitable environment.
::'''Chatillon:''' Miss Idyia also informed us about what was happening in Fontaine. Some of us got anxious and returned to Fontaine with her aid, but others felt it was meaningless to go back...
::'''Chatillon:''' I, too, was depressed for a while... But to repay Miss Idyia for saving my life, I decided to use my strength to help her make the park more fun and entertaining!
::'''Chatillon:''' After who knows how long, I started to miss my old work, so I decided to build this Crococannon, and a new attraction for the park...
::'''Paimon:''' So, does that mean you've been in Veluriyam Mirage for a long time now, Mr. Chatillon?
::'''Paimon:''' Why didn't you go back to your wife and daughter? Just what did Miss Idyia tell you...?
::{{DIcon}} My instincts are telling me...
::{{DIcon}} We shouldn't dig any deeper.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Hey, how come Mr. Chatillon is looking so gloomy all of a sudden?
::'''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon still doesn't know what exactly happened, but... your Crococannon made us really happy, and will certainly do the same for other visitors too, Mr. Chatillon!
::'''Paimon:''' So you can be happy, and forget all that stuff that makes you sad!
::'''Chatillon:''' You're right! I've got to get a hold of myself, and be happy! It's what they all would have wanted!
::'''Chatillon:''' Every time I see the Crococannon in action, it reminds me of my daughter's favorite crocodile doll... And once she grew up, how cool she looked when operating the cannons with her mother...
::'''Chatillon:''' Thank you! Your support for the Crococannon and my project means the world to me.
::'''Chatillon:''' I will make this attraction even more fun! If it becomes popular, then more people will play and forget the troubles of the past!
::{{DIcon}} Although I don't know the details...
::{{DIcon}} I wish you the best!
::'''Paimon:''' You will succeed for sure, Mr. Chatillon!
:{{DIcon}} We'll catch you later, bye!
::'''Chatillon:''' Yes, you seem quite busy, I understand. I'll be here waiting, come back whenever you have time!
