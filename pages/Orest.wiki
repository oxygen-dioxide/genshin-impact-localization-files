==Profile==
Orest was sent to the [[House of the Hearth]] and from there, joined the [[Fatui]] for a tax-free income in hopes of providing his younger sister with a better life. He was among those dispatched to the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]] in search of the [[Eternal Oasis]]. The expedition was unwittingly roped into the [[Tanit]] tribe matriarch [[Babel]]'s scheme to eliminate [[Jeht]] and the [[Traveler]], and captured Jeht when Babel sent the girl to them as a "traitor to the Tanit." Although the Fatui initially ambushed her and tranquilized her, when she awoke, the enraged girl slew one of their members, Jophery, in such a brutal manner that Orest described it as being turned into "festive confetti." The remaining members managed to subdue her with Electro bullets and sent her to another camp to be taken back to their superior, [[Froderock Fronkonsteen]].

Shortly after transferring Jeht to the next camp, the [[Traveler]] appeared in search of her. The Traveler defeated &mdash; and presumably slew &mdash; the Fatui personnel they encountered, among them [[Ilyusha]] and [[Yevgraf]], but spared Orest to extract answers from him. After giving them the information he knew, Orest wandered into the desert alone, afraid to return until the mission was deemed a failure.
