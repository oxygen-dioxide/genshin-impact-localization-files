'''Phlogiston''' is a [[Game System|mechanic]] unique to [[Natlan]] that can be used in combat, in exploration, and as an energy source. It is an advanced form of {{Pyro}} and the original form of the seven [[Element|elements]] in Teyvat<ref name="BSS">{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref>. It has various manifestations, including [[Liquid Phlogiston]], [[Solid Phlogiston]], [[Gaseous Phlogiston]], and [[Spiritway]]s.

Phlogiston is a form of {{w|computronium}} used by the [[dragons]], and is programmable matter considered the most efficient form of storing information.<ref name=Omen>{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref> It carries deep spiritual significance to the people of Natlan, symbolizing their indomitable spirit.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/nyI9wCt6su0 Genshin Impact Version 5.0 Special Program]</ref>

==Overview==
When Phlogiston is obtained, it fills the Phlogiston Meter, which is shared between all [[party]] members. It is consumed when in [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state after all [[Nightsoul point]]s are exhausted and when using various [[Saurian Indwelling]] abilities, including swimming in [[Liquid Phlogiston]].

The player can possess a maximum of '''100''' Phlogiston, indicated above the [[HP]] bar. When [[Saurian Indwelling|indwelling]] a [[Saurian]], the Saurian will have an extra Phlogiston storage of '''50''' points. Each Phlogiston Particle restores '''20''' points.

Phlogiston is not available in [[Domain]]s.

==Lore==
Phlogiston is Teyvat's primordial form of energy and was used by the [[Heavenly Principles]] as a basis for the creation of Elemental Energy for the purpose of developing a power to better counter the [[Abyss]]. Elemental energy is considered the modern counterpart to Phlogiston. It is likely synonymous with the concept of the "[[Light Realm]]" or "Vishap Realm".<ref name="BSS" />
