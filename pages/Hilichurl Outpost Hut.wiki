|description    = A hilichurl-style hut. It seems like a castle that's been locked up tight, but it is in fact quite airy and even has gaps in the roof through which rain may enter.<br>The scholar, Musk, pointed out that these gaps can be used to collect rainwater, and that indoor pots may be set up inside such structures.
