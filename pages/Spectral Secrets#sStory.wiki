|-
| Keep our Island Secure
| The specters' whereabouts is unknown, which has impacted many events planned to be held in the wild. One of the most effective measures in this scenario is armed intimidation.<br />Since the situation on-ground is highly dangerous, you must launch an expedition after conducting your preliminary investigation.

| {{Icon/Element|Electro}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
| No Stone Unturned
| In addition to investigating incidents in response to intel, the Guild will also take proactive action to produce leads that might otherwise be difficult to come across. However, activity of this nature tends to disturb life-forms in the areas in question.<br />As the situation on-ground is unknown, you must launch an expedition after conducting your preliminary investigation.

|-
| The Purge
| The specters have occupied a major transport route, leaving many merchants and travelers with no way forward. The Guild must join forces with the Tenryou Commission to safeguard the roads and restore traffic.<br />Due to the large number of specters, you must launch an expedition after conducting your preliminary investigation.

| Swarm of Specters
| An adventurer claims that a horde of specters has appeared in this area. The Guild must act fast to get rid of them and restore the safety of the area.<br />Due to the lack of intel concerning this incident, you must launch an expedition after conducting your preliminary investigation.

|-
| They're Everywhere
| A horde of specters has appeared in the wild, heading for a rather specific location. Their goal is unknown, but a gathering of elemental life-forms in and of itself is enough to pose a great danger.<br />Due to the large number of specters, you must launch an expedition after conducting your preliminary investigation.

|-
| Wafting from Afar
| Someone tried to draw the specters in with the scent of cooked food, but it provoked a bigger reaction from the specters than expected, and they lost control of the situation. A seasoned adventurer is needed to wipe out the specters.<br />As this area is highly dangerous, you must launch an expedition after conducting your preliminary investigation.

| The Way Back home
| To date, the specters' appearances and disappearances have been a mystery. Through painstaking observation, the Guild has now deduced the timing of their gatherings. If we can witness a disappearance, it will certainly take our research in this area forward.<br />As the situation on-ground is unknown, you must launch an expedition after conducting your preliminary investigation.

|-
| Elementary Research
| Elemental life-forms have always been the object of academic fascination. Many scholars have approached the Guild to post commissions, hoping that we can acquire some sample specters for them.<br />Assisting these scholars will also help the Guild improve our understanding of the situation. Head to the sight where specters have been spotted and bring back some samples.

|-
| Follow the Trail of Breadcrumbs
|An adventurer came across a location where a large horde of specters were gathered. Their breeding ground could well be nearby.<br />We must deal with the cause of this issue, not the symptoms alone. If we can find their breeding ground, it will certainly take our investigation forward.
| {{Card|Teachings of Elegance|2–6}}
| {{Icon/Element|Electro}}{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}
|-
| Fruity Business
| A starving adventurer out in the wild mistook the specters for juicy fruits, approached them, and was given a firm, hard knock in response.<br />He was not injured. However, we still hope to get on-ground as quickly as possible to confirm the details of the specters' appearance and disappearance.
| {{Card|Teachings of Transience|2–6}}
| {{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Electro}}
|-
| Missing in Action
| An adventurer sent to investigate the specters still has not reported back to the Guild. The Guild is looking for a seasoned adventurer to head to his last known location and rescue him. There is no time to delay — set off immediately.
| {{Card|Hero's Wit|1–3}}
| {{Icon/Element|Anemo}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
| Mind the Will-O'-the-Wisp
| Many people report having seen strange colors here in the night sky. They believe it to be a supernatural phenomenon. Following a careful analysis of the eyewitnesses' descriptions, the Guild believes this to be spectral activity. Head to the location and find out for sure.

| {{Icon/Element|Electro}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
| Snipe Dream
| A young archer has come across a horde of specters in the wild. She thought they'd make good natural archery targets and decided to get some practice in.<br />But her archery skills are not up to scratch, so if they respond aggressively, it's highly likely that she will be unable to fend them off. Someone needs to head over there and talk her out of this idea.

| {{Icon/Element|Hydro}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
| Some Sort of Summoning Ceremony?
| An eyewitness saw a horde of specters congregate together and then started circling around the same spot incessantly.<br />We require an adventurer to conduct on-site observations to help us ascertain the meaning of this activity.

| {{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}
|-
| Sopping-Wet Crops
| A horde of specters has appeared near a crop plantation, causing the surrounding environment to become drenched. This may well affect the successful growth of the crops, and ultimately whether they can be harvested.<br />Even if we don't learn anything about what they're up to, we need to get rid of them as soon as possible.

| {{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Cryo}}
|-
| To Dye For
| A tailor who has taken a keen interest in the specters has commissioned the Guild to acquire some for the purposes of creating a dye needed in the making of a new suit.<br />Making a dye from elemental life-forms is certainly a novel idea. Such is the mindset of the fashionista, we suppose.

|-
| Windward Bound
| A wild wind has begun blowing in this area, and one adventurer who is particularly attuned to the weather has discerned the pattern by which it comes and goes. Follow the wind to its source, and perhaps we can uncover some further clues regarding the specters.

| A Foreign Substance
| Someone found a very rare crystal in the wild, and research confirms it was produced by a specter. The presence of this crystal suggests that there may well be specters nearby, in which case the area is worth investigating.

| {{Icon/Element|Electro}}{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
| Elemental Reaction Hazard
| The specters congregating here are causing all kinds of destructive elemental reactions. No material damage has been caused as of yet, but uncontrolled elemental activity is not a threat to be ignored. Please investigate the area, and also warn people nearby to stay safe and keep their distance.

|-
| Find the Lost Goods
| A merchant caravan was attacked by specters while traveling through the wild. The goods have been thrown left, right, and center, and they desperately need a kind and capable adventurer to help them out.<br />A word of caution — specters may not be the only danger present in the area.

|-
| For the Love of Mora
| The word on the street is that the elemental energy cores left behind by specters fetch a very good price on the market. This has prompted many to head off into the wild to search for them, but as elemental life-forms, these specters are highly likely to pose a danger to ordinary folk. Go and convince them to come back.

|-
| Hey, Don't Run Off!
| Some youngsters who have never seen a specter before have run off excitedly into the wild, hoping to see one. It is imperative that we bring them safely back before they really do encounter one, or things are bound to get dangerous.

| {{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Hydro}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
| Mysterious Markings
| Some very strange marks have been spotted in the wild. From the shape, they do not appear to be from any well-known life-form.<br />Perhaps they were made by the specters, who have been appearing here frequently. We need someone to head to the scene and take a look, and remove any potential threats.

|-
| Postponed at the Last Minute
| An event that was planned in this location had to be put on hold after a horde of specters appeared. The Guild has received an emergency commission asking for assistance in restoring order as soon as possible, so that the event can continue as planned.

|-
| Romantically Inclined
| It is written in one light novel that "specters come and go as they please, usually remaining hidden. If you see them gathering in large numbers with your own eyes, it means something good will happen in your life soon." The book is correct about this being an uncommon occurrence, but remember — safety first, notions of how to chase after romance and good luck second.

| Super-Sized Specter
| Adventurer intel informs us that a large specter has appeared here, much bigger than any encountered before. This must be investigated, both to mitigate the threat and for the sake of ecological research.

| To Battle
| It appears that the hilichurls here are engaged in hostilities with the specters, and the battle is affecting people passing through the area. Head to the area and bring a stop to the fighting.
