|desc_suspicious = This one was a failed test run, being unpleasantly bitter and uncomfortably spicy. You could try mixing it with rice - or you could simply discard it and eat the rice instead.
|desc_basic      = They say it was originally just a rustic dish that everyone in Qingce Village knew how to make. But quite unexpectedly, its crispy and spicy dishes gained the recognition of people from elsewhere, and thus began to spread throughout the Liyue region.
|desc_delicious  = Just catching a whiff is enough to work up one's appetite. The tingle of chili titillates the tongue, leaving you ready to devour ten bowls in a single sitting.
