==Profile==
Date is a character mentioned by [[Ema]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Collection of Dragons and Snakes}}</ref> She states that he was the son of a man named [[Eurydates]], and was from a wealthy and distinguished clan of Byakuyakoku. Based on what book he borrowed and why he borrowed it, it can be inferred that he is something of an inventor. Ema is cross with him because the book he borrowed, [[Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku]], is overdue.
