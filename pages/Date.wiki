==Profile==
Date was the son of a man named [[Eurydates]], and was from a wealthy and distinguished clan of Byakuyakoku.<ref name="CDS">{{Ref/Quest|Collection of Dragons and Snakes}}</ref>

At some point, he borrowed ''[[Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku]]'' from [[Ema]] (the librarian) to study "the principles of load-bearing, the maximization of underground spaces, the avoidance of water leakage, and even some principles of geomancy."<ref name="DC" /> Unfortunately, he placed it within one of his labyrinths, to Ema's great annoyance. After completing ''[[Date's Challenge]]'', the [[Traveler]] returns this book to Ema as part of the Quest ''[[Collection of Dragons and Snakes]]''.
