'''Scrooge''' is an [[NPC]] aligned with the [[Treasure Hoarders]] who appears in the last leg of the commission [[A Surprise Gift]].

If the player chooses to ask [[Vile]] to help them find [[Rudolf]] a gift to give to [[Jilliana]], the gift will cause Jilliana to run off to [[Whispering Woods]]. The player will follow her there and witness a conversation between herself and Scrooge that reveals she was formerly part of the Treasure Hoarders.
