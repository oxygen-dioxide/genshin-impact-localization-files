{{Description|"Like any successful adventurer, hunters never rush into danger. One must tactfully hide and wait to strike."|2=[[Alice]] in [https://youtu.be/bx2aWuUjxnE Collected Miscellany - "Aloy: Mystical Glow of Frost"]}}
'''Easy Does It''' is [[Aloy]]'s [[Utility Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* This talent also works on animals who produce [[Mysterious Meat]].
* If a character gets too close to the animals, they will still get startled regardless if one was walking or not attacking at all. Likewise, if an animal is killed, the rest nearby will also become startled.
