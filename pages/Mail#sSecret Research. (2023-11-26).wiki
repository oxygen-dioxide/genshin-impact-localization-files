|text      = Today, I'd like to take this opportunity to go somewhere a bit further away and conduct... some secret research that I've been planning.

I've always been fascinated by the bone shards that Geovishap Hatchlings carry with them. What kind of creatures were they originally from? Do they still exist in this land? How long have their bones been lying somewhere out there, unknown to humankind? Why do the Geovishap Hatchlings treat them like they're some sort of treasure? If we could just collect enough relevant data, we might just be able to shed some light on these questions!

The only thing is... Geovishap Hatchlings and Geovishaps are usually found out in the wilds of Liyue. Going alone would definitely be very dangerous, so I'd like to invite you to come along with me.

If you could spare the time, I'd be extremely grateful. Everything else we come across is yours &mdash; as long as I get the bone shards and the data, I'll be more than satisfied.
