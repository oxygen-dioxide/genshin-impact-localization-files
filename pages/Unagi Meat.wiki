'''Unagi Meat''' is a [[Cooking Ingredient]] item used in recipes to create [[Food]] items.

==How to Obtain==
Unagi are found in shallow waters in [[Inazuma]], mainly [[Watatsumi Island]]. They must be caught by the player to obtain a default Unagi Meat item regardless of the [[Unagi|species]] caught. However, this can be a difficult task as Eels are rare in the overworld, and escape quickly when alerted. A more reliable source of Unagi Meat is [[Yamashiro Kenta]]'s shop in [[Ritou]], which sells 10 Unagi Meat, refreshing daily.

See the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=254 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.
