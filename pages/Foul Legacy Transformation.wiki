'''Foul Legacy Transformation''' is a combat technique utilized by [[Tartaglia]]. He has used it during his boss fight, [[Enter the Golden House]], as well as in a cutscene during his [[Story Quest]] [[Mighty Cyclops' Adventure!]].

While under the effects of Foul Legacy Transformation, Tartaglia is able to wield the powers of his [[Hydro]] [[Vision]] and [[Electro]] [[Delusion]] at the same time. However, using this ability is extremely draining on him and has lasting repercussions on his body.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Heart of Glaze}}</ref><ref name="TTT">{{Ref/Quest|Teucer's Terrific Tour}}</ref>

This power has no relation to his Delusion; he learned it from [[Skirk]] after he fell into the [[Abyss]], before he joined the [[Fatui]].<ref>{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|4}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Shard of a Foul Legacy}}</ref><ref name="Childe Namecard">Namecard: [[Childe: Foul Legacy]]</ref>

==Characteristics==
When Tartaglia activates this ability, he grows to twice his size and dons a black and violet armor. He also now levitates off the floor and moves around at breakneck speed.

His armor is primarily black, with a violet fade from his midriff to his upper thighs. His torso sports his original outfit's collar, and his [[Hydro]] [[Vision]], with a lavender, feathery collar at his neck. He also wears a long cape with a starry pattern. His armor extends to his arms, as well, with his fingers now wearing sharp gray claws. At his navel is his Electro Delusion. His legs are also armored, complemented by a silver lining, and a violet diamond pattern where his kneecaps are. Finally, his mask takes a new form, covering the entirety of his face, and elongating to sport long horns at his head. The face of the mask is featureless, save for a single purple eye.

==Trivia==
* While {{lang|"Foul Legacy Transformation" (or simply "Foul Legacy")|zh=魔王武装|zh_tl=Demon King Armament}} is used in some of Tartaglia's Talent and Constellation names, within the story, it exclusively refers to the form he takes on during the third phase of Enter the Golden House.<ref name="Childe Namecard" /><ref name="TTT" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Heart of Glaze|archive=1|quote=Presuming that you beat him to the Gnosis, Childe becomes enraged, activates his Foul Legacy Transformation, and continues to do battle with you...}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Defender of Childhood Dreams|archive=1}}</ref>
** The description for [[Childe: Foul Legacy]] states that {{lang|Foul Legacy|zh=魔王|zh_tn=Demon King}} is the name of Tartaglia and Skirk's fighting style, which combines many different fighting techniques. Notably, the original Chinese description removed the {{zh|武装|tl=Armament}} part used in other instances of {{lang|Foul Legacy/Foul Legacy Transformation|zh=魔王武装}}.
** Comparisons have been made between Tartaglia's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst, and the fighting style used by the [[Abyss Order]] enemy [[Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents]].
* After Tartaglia unleashes Foul Legacy Transformation during Enter the Golden House, the English localization has him declare ''"Foul Legacy - The Devouring Deep!"'' However, the original Chinese text calls it {{zh|极恶法「鲸吞噬灭」|rm=Jí'è-fǎ "Jīngtūn-shìmiè"|tl=Extreme Evil Art 'Whale Swallowing Devouring Destruction,'}} a phrase which is equivalent to the {{lang|"Havoc"|zh=极恶技|zh_rm=Jí'è-jì|zh_tl=Extreme Evil Technique}} used in Tartaglia's Elemental Burst, [[Havoc: Obliteration]], and his Constellations [[Havoc: Formless Blade]] and [[Havoc: Annihilation]].
