|text    = It's not actually my birthday today since I'll need to wait another year before the actual date finally comes around, but getting together with my dads and friends means far more to me than just celebrating the day of my birth.

This year, my dads chipped in and bought me a big double-decker cake. I guess it's true what people say: you get what you pay for. The cream and fruit on the cake were soooo delicious that they nearly brought me to tears.

I'm really blessed! It's something special that I get cake and care from everyone each year for my birthday!

I wanted to share my happiness with you, so I attached a little something to the letter, haha. Thanks for all you've done for me this year. I can't wait to adventure with you again in the future! We really make an amazing team!
