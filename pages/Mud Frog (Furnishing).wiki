|description    = A small frog that often appears in wetlands.<br>This animal is very common in wetland areas, and its body secretes a mysterious sticky substance that has much medicinal utility. As opposed to normal frogs, the yellow Mud Frogs are better at camouflaging themselves along wet banks.<br>They say that in [[Fontaine]], people refer to brigands who escape capture often or evildoers who evade judgment as "mud frogs in butter."<br>After a long time spent living in the Serenitea Pot, other animal residents came to recognize the Mud Frogs' uncanny powers of camouflage. Even the sharpest cat might barely detect a passing Mud Frog as it moves along the shore &mdash; or at least, until it gets splashed in the face.
