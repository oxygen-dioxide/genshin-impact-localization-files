{{Lang|'''Shiki Koshou'''|ja=式小将|ja_rm=Shiki Shoushou}} is a commemorative event gadget from the [[Labyrinth Warriors]] [[Event]].

Shiki Koshou is not a true gadget and is merely toggled on when equipped, thus regular gadgets can still be used as per normal. Shiki Koshou will also temporarily disappear when in combat mode.

==Notes==
* It cannot be used at the same time as any other [[Gadget]] of the "Equipment" type.
