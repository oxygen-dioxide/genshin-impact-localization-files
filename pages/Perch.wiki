'''Perches''' are significant trees that can be found around [[Tsurumi Island]]. The native people of the island believe that it is necessary to make offerings to them because the [[Thunderbird]] once perched on those trees.

The perches feature as a gameplay mechanic in the [[World Quest]] series [[Through the Mists]].
