{{Dialogue start}}
===Daytime===
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' Hello. Can I help you?
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' You have two seconds to tell me what you need.
:{{DIcon}} What's your&mdash;
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Role? Clerk at the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Name? Ask me again after my shift.
::{{DIcon}} I want to&mdash;
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Take a proficiency test? Declare a tax liability? Apply for an exit permit? Rent a mooring space?
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Which service do you require?
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Hurry up! And then hurry up some more!
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' You're taking too long! Sorry, can't afford to waste precious time on people like...
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' ...Never mind, no time. Next customer, please!
:{{DIcon}} Good&mdash;
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Goodbye. Next time, prepare first!

===Nighttime===
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' Whew... As soon as I stop working, the anxiety just hits me...
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' Hello? What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Anxiety?
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Yeah. Do you ever feel like there just aren't enough hours in the day?
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' That feeling of... I'm enjoying myself, but I can't fully relax because there is still that thing at the back of my mind... But then, you still can't force yourself to go and deal with the thing...
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' *sigh* People are strange creatures. We know full well that time is limited, but we still kid ourselves by saying things like, "Oh, surely just a bit longer can't hurt..."
:{{DIcon}} What's bothering you?
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' You'll laugh at me if I tell you, but... Well, my dream is to work my way up and become one of the [[Qixing]] one day. Someone big and successful.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' I know it sounds ridiculous, the idea of starting as a minor clerk and somehow ending up as one of the Qixing...
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' But if I don't at least try, none of my dreams will ever become reality.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Zhao, there's no time to waste...
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' ...Aah, what am I doing here then!? I must get back to work!
::{{DIcon}} You really do work hard.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' If I want to become a member of the Liyue Qixing, this work-rate is just what is expected of me, isn't it?
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' ...And honestly, I'm not working anywhere near hard enough.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' I've had to travel to Yuehai Pavilion many times in order to settle some matters. Every time I go there, I can see Miss [[Ganyu]] doing overtime work.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Perhaps this is because she works directly for the Qixing at Yuehai Pavilion, while I'm just a small-time clerk...
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Argh..<!--.--> No, I have to work harder!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Back to it? Goodness, you're so hardworking...
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' I should get back too, I can't keep wasting time here...
