|description    = An intricate model of a harp with exquisitely carved decorations on the body. It is the same design as the harp in the Faded Castle.<br>It is said that harps are one of the simplest instruments, yet also one of the most difficult. The timbre and texture are quite straightforward, and even a child still mastering language can easily pluck out a performance. But the harp's intonation relies completely upon the harpist's experiences. Even with decades of experience, unexpected mistakes may still occur during a performance. As such, according to some critics, the harp is regarded as the beginning and the end for all musicians. Of course, this is naturally hyperbole, but it also goes to show the unique significance of the harp.
