==Descriptions==
{{Description|An underwater stronghold that has a measure of autonomy and self-governance from Fontaine's legal systems. This is where those who have stood trial and been sentenced are sent, and it is also the largest manufacturer of Fontaine's clockwork meka. Over many long years, the metal-walled fastness has kept a great many secrets.|[[Map]] description}}

==Lore==
Although the Fortress of Meropide is Fontaine's ''de facto'' prison, it is technically an autonomous entity that governs itself and is not under the jurisdiction of Fontaine's legal system. Criminals sent there are technically exiles from Fontaine, and the [[Court of Fontaine]] has no control over it other than sending some [[Garde]]s to help with security.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Tea Party Most Thorny}}</ref> The prison also doubles as a factory, creating many [[Clockwork Meka]].

The Fortress was first built by a group of exiled criminals after the first Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]], began her rule in Fontaine. These criminals were shunned by society and were refused assistance. As a result, some of them began to repent and beg for mercy, which Egeria heard and granted, telling them to help protect her secret beneath the waves. Guiding them to the spot, the exiled community began to grow in size. Even after the first group of exiles had died, subsequent groups continued their work. The "secret" that Egeria wanted hidden was actually an entrance to the [[Primordial Sea]], which the exiles had sealed and labeled as the "forbidden zone", restricted to all but the warden and other trusted individuals.

Roughly 400 years before the events of the game, Neuvillette sentenced [[Vautrin]], the former head of the [[Special Security and Surveillance Patrol]], to the Fortress during a trial regarding his extrajudicial killings and abuse of power to avenge [[Carole]]. This was secretly prepared by Vautrin to feign resentment in order to show Neuvillette's impartiality and fairness to ensure that the [[Melusine]]s would integrate into Fontainian society. Upon arriving at the Fortress, Vautrin formed the [[Mutual Aid Society]], a group that was well received by many inmates who worked together to work and protect together.<ref name="AFT">{{Ref/Quest|A Familiar Threat}}</ref>

At some point after the Melusines explored Fontaine's surface, a Melusine, [[Sigewinne]], was sentenced and sent to the prison for breaking an ancient Fontanian law regarding species changing. She had willingly given up her Melusine form to become more human-like (namely her skin and having human hands) with a potion given to her by her teacher in order to save a human friend of hers, whose parents refused to let a Melusine treat her. Neuvillette suspected that the law was placed by Egeria in order to prevent others from following in her footsteps. After completing her sentence, Sigewinne decided to remain in the prison in order to care for the inmates with her medical knowledge, which made her universally beloved.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Warmth of Lies}}</ref>

The main currency of the prison are [[Credit Coupons]], which are used for all transactions in the Fortress of Meropide instead of Mora. The Credit Coupons were created by the [[Fatui Harbinger]] [[Regrator]] in collaboration with a previous administrator of the Fortress, as part of an economic experiment.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Cashflow Supervision}}</ref>

When Wriothesley was a teenager, he was found guilty of killing his foster parents in an act of vengeance after learning the truth of their foster home scheme and was sent to the Fortress of Meropide to serve his sentence.<ref name="AFT" /> When he arrived, inmates had a greater buying power with the Coupons, such as assassinations and illegal drugs. Wriothesley accumulated a large number of coupons, more than the rest of the inmates combined, resulting in the previous administrator wiping his account clean in a single stroke. Having made many connections, Wriothesley proceeded to challenge the administrator to a duel which no one opposed. The administrator fled before the duel, but as it happened on the same day he was supposed to be released, Wriothesley had no one to sign his exit papers. Instead, he took up the mantle of administrator and implemented a series of reforms to make life in the Fortress more bearable. These reforms, combined with potential ostracization upon returning to society, has caused some convicts to want to stay in the Fortress even after they finish serving their sentences.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/NUBIYZ_KQFc Version 4.1 Special Program]</ref>

The Fortress has several "hidden" rules, and breaking them is implied to be dangerous, however they are meant as lessons for prisoners:
* Inmates cannot work for more than three days in a row - doing so will result in mystery meat being given for the next Welfare Meal. This is actually prepared by Sigewinne, who examines the state of those who have worked for three days straight, and thus she makes an "extra" dish to help restore their stamina. However, as Melusines perceive the world differently than humans, the dish looks discolored and inedible to humans, so inmates do not eat it.
* Inmates cannot bet on both fighters in the [[Pankration Ring]] - doing so will result in a strange bottle of red liquid that looks like blood being given to them the next day. The liquid is actually an experimental [[Fonta]] drink Wriothesley deemed to be of low value, and is meant to teach the inmate the value of Credit Coupons.
* An unknown rule related to Sigewinne and the people in the infirmary.
** There are two unwritten rules related to Sigewinne herself; it is not known if they are related to the main unknown rule:
*** Anyone who is rude to Sigewinne are punished "extra" harshly, and particularly wild and violent newcomers are given a "warning" upon admission into the prison.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Sigewinne}}</ref> 

[[Tartaglia]] was sent to the prison during the events of {{Quest|As Light Rain Falls Without Reason}} after being convicted by the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] for being the mastermind behind the serial disappearances case despite the [[Marcel (Fontaine)|real culprit]] already being exposed and sentenced as guilty during the trial.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Return to the Waters}}</ref> After spending some time in the Fortress, Tartaglia went missing.

In the {{Quest|To the Stars Shining in the Depths}}, Neuvillette pressed false charges against the Traveler to give them the opportunity to infiltrate and investigate the fortress, talk with Wriothesley, and gain intel on Tartaglia's whereabouts. The [[Fatui]] had also sent infiltrators inside as informants for both the prisoners and guards, only for them to disappear too, as Wriothesley had correctly anticipated the Fatui infiltrating his fortress and was displeased by the intrusions. [[The Knave]] would then send [[Lyney]], [[Lynette]] and [[Freminet]] to infiltrate the fortress to gather information. Wriothesley also revealed to the Traveler the construction of a [[The Wingalet|massive ship]] to help deal with the prophecy as a failsafe.

During the Traveler and the Fatui's investigation, they discovered the "forbidden zone" and its true purpose. In the past year prior to the events of the game, the concentration of Primordial Seawater in the waters around Meropide had begun to increase, and this increased concentration caused Freminet to pass out when he tried to track Childe's "escape" route. Soon after, the sluice gate holding back the water broke, but was temporarily held by Wriothesley and [[Clorinde]] before Neuvillette arrived, pushed back the water, and restored the sluice gate, keeping the waters back for the time being.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Calamitous Tread}}</ref>

When the [[Prophecy of Fontaine]] arrives, Wriothesley has the ship, named The Wingalet, deploy into Fontaine to help in rescue operations. Once the waters recede, the ship returns to the prison and is placed in storage, making impressive headlines on the media and gaining the attention of several researchers.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Méropide is the French translation of {{W|Meropis}}, the name of a fictional island created by the ancient Greek writer {{W|Theopompus}} in his work, ''Philippica''; as a parody of {{W|Plato}}'s {{W|Atlantis}}.
** Meropis is also where [[Remus|King Remus]] is said to have first descended upon [[Fontaine]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria}}</ref>
* The Administrative Area of the Fortress resembles the {{W|Panopticon}}, a prison layout proposed by English social theorist Jeremy Benthem, which features a central guard tower surrounded by inmate cells. This design theoretically enables a single guard to effectively monitor the entire prison, as prisoners, unaware of the guard's location, would always behave as if they're under surveillance.
