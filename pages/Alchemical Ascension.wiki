==Trivia==
* [[Co-Op Mode]] is disabled while the player is in the [[Alchemical Ascension (Point of Interest)|Alchemical Ascension area]] and is re-enabled once the player leaves the area.
* If there are available special customers whose orders were not fulfilled or an available Alchemy Exam that is not yet passed, then cycles alternate between having a special customer or Sucrose present and having none of them present.<!-- attempting to simplify findings -->
** A maximum of one of the aforementioned characters can be present.
** New special customers and Sucrose arriving with a new exam are prioritized.
** If both special customers with unfulfilled orders and an incomplete Alchemy Exam exist, then the cycles in which someone is present would alternate between Sucrose and any special customer.
** As a result of this cycle alternation, Sucrose can be up to 4 cycles "late" with a new Alchemy Exam.
** ''[[A Job Well Done]]'' can offset the cycle alternation by 1 cycle.
