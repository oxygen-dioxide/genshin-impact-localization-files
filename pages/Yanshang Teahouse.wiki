Yanshang Teahouse claims to offers high-quality teas and "other goods" but is actually a casino.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Guanhai|s=Nighttime|q='''Guanhai:''' Wanna play cards mate? Come, enjoy the night!}}</ref> They refuse to show their stock of tea varieties and customers must pay a deposit up-front in order to enter.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chuyi}}</ref> The teahouse is notorious for having bad customer service. Its hostess, [[Chuyi]], is extremely rude.

Before the [[Traveler]]'s arrival to Liyue, the previous owner had an outstanding debt with the [[Northland Bank]], who in turn sent [[Tartaglia|Childe]] and [[Javert]] to reclaim it by force. Childe exposed the previous owner's fraud, landing him in jail, while also obtaining a [[Sigil of Permission]] in the process.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/ZF4KyX0ASnI Character Tales - "Childe: Sigil of Permission" | Genshin Impact]</ref>

After [[Osial]]'s defeat, the Fatui that were previously using the teahouse left. [[Yelan]], who had intended on investigating the previous owner on her return from abroad, took this opportunity to turn the teahouse into her secret base.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Yelan|5}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Yelan|About Tartaglia}}</ref> Soon, she became famous for her gambling skills and people warned others of her in the [[Chihu Rock Bulletin Board]].<ref>{{Ref/BB|Chihu Rock Bulletin Board|About Yelan}}</ref>

==Trivia==
=== Etymology===
* Considering there is a cliff behind the store, {{Lang|"yanshang"|zh=岩上|zh_rm=yánshàng}} may mean "on a cliff." Alternatively, it may mean "above the [Chihu] Rock," as it is located on the street of which lower end is a square called the Chihu Rock.
*In the Chinese version, the securities [[The Halberd]] and [[The Fang]] only say {{Lang|"Hēng?"|zh=哼？}} and {{Lang|"Hā?"|zh=哈？}}, respectively. They are likely a reference to the {{Lang|{{w|Heng and Ha|Two Generals Heng and Ha}}|zh=哼哈二将|zh_rm=Hēng Hā Ėr Jiàng}}, a type of ''{{w|menshen}}'' (Chinese gate gods who usually form a pair), who originated as Buddhist guardian deities but were later incorporated into Chinese legends as mythological generals by the fantasy novel ''{{w|Investiture of the Gods}}'' (16th century).
