==Lore==
Yanshang Teahouse is a casino<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Guanhai|s=Nighttime|q='''Guanhai:''' Wanna play cards mate? Come, enjoy the night!}}</ref> disguised as a teahouse that sells only high-quality teas and "other goods." Under the original owner's policies, the Teahouse exclusively serves wealthy patrons, and admittance to the Teahouse requires paying an upfront deposit.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chuyi|s=1}}</ref> [[Chuyi]]'s rude attitude deters ordinary, less wealthy people from entering.

Shortly before the [[Traveler]]'s arrival to Liyue, [[Tartaglia]] and [[Javert]] confronted Yanshang Teahouse's owner about an outstanding debt he owed the [[Northland Bank]]. After incapacitating the Teahouse's occupants, Tartaglia took the owner's [[Sigil of Permission]] for himself<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/ZF4KyX0ASnI Character Tales - "Childe: Sigil of Permission" | Genshin Impact]</ref> and exposed the owner's fraud. The owner was sent to prison, which allowed [[Yelan]] to take over the Teahouse as her secret base following [[Osial]]'s defeat.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yelan|About Tartaglia}}</ref><ref name="Chuyi2">{{Ref/NPC|Chuyi|s=2}}</ref>

Under Yelan's management, Yanshang Teahouse remains a casino, but has much more relaxed policies; as a result, Chuyi drops the previous aggressive tone she originally had.<ref name="Chuyi2" /> Yelan has also become notorious among its patrons for her gambling skills, and people are warned to avoid playing against her.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Yelan|5}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Chihu Rock Bulletin Board|About Yelan}}</ref>

==Trivia==
=== Etymology===
* Considering there is a cliff behind the store, {{Lang|"yanshang"|zh=岩上|zh_rm=yánshàng}} may mean "on a cliff." Alternatively, it may mean "above the [Chihu] Rock," as it is located on the street of which lower end is a square called the Chihu Rock.
*In the Chinese version, the securities [[The Halberd]] and [[The Fang]] only say {{Lang|"Hēng?"|zh=哼？}} and {{Lang|"Hā?"|zh=哈？}}, respectively. They are likely a reference to the {{Lang|{{w|Heng and Ha|Two Generals Heng and Ha}}|zh=哼哈二将|zh_rm=Hēng Hā Ėr Jiàng}}, a type of ''{{w|menshen}}'' (Chinese gate gods who usually form a pair), who originated as Buddhist guardian deities but were later incorporated into Chinese legends as mythological generals by the fantasy novel ''{{w|Investiture of the Gods}}'' (16th century).
