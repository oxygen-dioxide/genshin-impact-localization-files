'''Primal Constructs''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group. As leftover technology of [[King Deshret]]'s civilization, they are primarily found across the [[Great Red Sand]].

In combat, they perform [[Physical]] attacks and may enter an invisible state after deploying parts on the battlefield. While a Primal Construct is in this state, the player can destroy its deployed parts, forcing it to repair them. If an {{Electro}} attack hits a part while it is being repaired, the Primal Construct will become paralyzed. Alternatively, the player may inflict [[Catalyze|Quicken]], [[Frozen]], or [[Petrification]] onto the invisible construct to immediately end this state.

Like [[Ruin Machine]]s, some Primal Constructs may be dormant instead of patrolling a set route. Using [[Elemental Sight]] helps distinguish dormant constructs from those serving as scenery.

{{Description|The guardians of the lost ancient desert ruins have power enough to punish any who would presume to disturb the pure dreams of their lord.<br>It is said that the [[King Deshret|master of the sands]] once dreamed of an eternal paradise. Today, that utopia is long gone, and the dreams and oaths, forgotten by the world, are now only found in the mantras inscribed upon these machines.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
