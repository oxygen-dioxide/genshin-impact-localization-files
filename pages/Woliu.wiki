==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Woliu:''' The qualities of the soil and water, its specific composition... All of this is worth careful study...
;(If the player has not completed ''Temporary Acclimatization'')
::{{DIcon}} And you are?
:::'''Woliu:''' Hello there! I'm Woliu, a hydrologist working for the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]], and currently conducting a routine survey of Chenyu Vale's hydrological and pedological conditions.
:::'''Woliu:''' Hmm, looking at you... You wouldn't happen to be an adventurer, would you? Excellent, perfect... Perhaps we'll get a chance to work together!
;(If the player has completed ''Temporary Acclimatization'')
::{{DIcon}} Ms. Woliu, how have you been?
:::'''Woliu:''' We meet again. I'm still surveying the hydrological and soil conditions.
:::'''Woliu:''' I remember the slick moves you showed me last time. If it's possible, I'd like to work with you again next time. As for the reward... I guarantee you'll be satisfied!
:{{DIcon}} You seem to be studying something very profound.
::'''Woliu:''' It may sound profound, but if we're talking about the basic principles, it's more like... analyzing the various ingredients and seasoning of a dish?
::'''Woliu:''' The most difficult part of this job is obtaining samples and determining effective components, both of which require highly specialized equipment to complete.
::'''Woliu:''' Sometimes, I even use consumable devices from Fontaine in addition to my equipment from Liyue.
::'''Woliu:''' If you carefully calculate the costs, this work is a pretty expensive undertaking! Without an appropriate organization allocating funds, most people couldn't handle all the required outlays.
::'''Woliu:''' Even researchers sent by the [[Akademiya]] probably can't cover all of the expenses, so just trying to transplant tea trees from [[Chenyu Vale]] to [[Sumeru]] is a fool's errand.
::'''Woliu:''' As far as the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] is concerned, if we can completely understand the composition of the soil, and determine the essential components critical for commercial crops...
::'''Woliu:''' Then it'll be easy to pump up production of our biggest cash crops!
::'''Woliu:''' Yeah, when I think about it that way, my work is pretty awesome!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Woliu:''' ...Huh. Was someone speaking to me just now?
