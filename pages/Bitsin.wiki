:{{DIcon|Warrior's Challenge}} Let's begin!

:'''Bitsin:''' When leaping to greater heights, never forget to look down for a foothold. That's... the secret to jumping ever higher!

;(Upon reaching the Graffiti Alliance HQ)
:'''Bitsin:''' Oh, wow, now that's nimble...

;(Upon crossing the wooden bridge)
:'''Bitsin:''' Amazing! Lots of people can't get this far.

;(Approach the second wooden bridge)
:'''Bitsin:''' Looks like you might be able to finish all the challenges after all. Can't wait to see it!

;(Upon crossing the second bridge)
:'''Bitsin:''' Impressive, nice moves!

;(Approach the main building)
:'''Bitsin:''' Yeah, you're almost at the finish... Hey! The finish line is... Just look up, it's right above you!
