{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Scene begins in a tavern)
:'''Flower-Feather Clan Warrior:''' You'll do great! Even two against one
:'''People of the Springs Warrior:''' Haha, you bet! Or even three against one
:;(Four of the original six heroes of Natlan - [[Sundjatta]], [[Tupac]], [[Wanjiru]] and [[Menilek]] - make a toast)
:'''Sundjatta:''' ...I propose a toast. To the two who are no longer with us: [[Sanhaj]] and [[Burkina]]
:;(The four of them drink together)
:'''Tupac:''' *sigh* It's not the same without them here, they'll both be missed
:'''Tupac:''' Even though Sanhaj wasn't that much of a talker...
:'''Wanjiru:''' And yet the news of his death rings loud and clear, a rallying cry in our hearts
:;(Menilek slams his cup down)
:'''Menilek:''' Hero! He died a hero! Him and Burkina both!
:;(The others look at him in surprise before laughing)
:'''Sundjatta:''' Hehe... Now a second toast: to the [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]] in whom we place all of our trust
:'''Menilek:''' Here's to her courage, indomitable will, and magnificent plan!
:'''Tupac:''' I just wish she would've joined us for tonight... She should be here, sharing a drink with us
:'''Wanjiru:''' She's making a five-hundred year trip alone... 
:'''Wanjiru:''' If it were me, my emotions would be all over the place
:'''Wanjiru:''' Give her some time
:'''Sundjatta:''' This final toast is to us...
:;(Sundjatta refills Wanjiru's cup)
:'''Sundjatta:''' And to our impending death, both grim and glorious
:'''Wanjiru:''' Certain defeat tomorrow... We'll march to our deaths, eh? Hehehe...
:'''Wanjiru:''' So, you ready to face it, Tupac?
:'''Tupac:''' Defeat? Says who? Our sacrifice will feed the Sacred Flame, paving the way for true victory in 500 years
:'''Tupac:''' I am ready, Natlanese warriors don't fear death. Am I right, Menilek?
:;(Menilek is fast asleep)
:'''Tupac:''' ...Menilek?
:'''Sundjatta, Tupac, Wanjiru:''' Hahahaha
:;(The scene pans to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]])
:'''Wanjiru:''' Let him sleep...
:'''Wanjiru:''' Fearlessness is one thing. But to nap in the face of death? You don't see that every day
----
;(The scene cuts to Mavuika sitting on a cliff, overlooking the Stadium)
:'''Mavuika:''' Sunset... The sky burns bright tonight ...Just like the day I took office
:;(The scene cuts to Mavuika talking to her younger sister [[Hine]])
:'''Mavuika:''' Hine... What are you doing?
:'''Hine:''' Um, [[Haumia|Mom]] said... You shouldn't stare at bright flames, or you'll hurt your eyes
:'''Hine:''' And I heard that you're the brightest flame of all now. So... I'm covering my eyes
:;(Mavuika sighs and kneels down)
:'''Mavuika:''' Hine, take your arm away
:;(Their [[Yumkasaur]] companion jumps onto Mavuika's shoulder)
:'''Hine:''' Ahh...! Wow! Your flames aren't blinding at all
:'''Hine:''' They're so warm... Like... like the setting sun! Everyone looks at it, but no one gets hurt. ...Mavuika?
:'''Mavuika:''' Hine... Do you think... There'll be sunsets like this in the far future, too?
----
;(The scene cuts to the four heroes and Mavuika on a cliff overlooking an area with severe Abyssal contamination)
:'''Sundjatta:''' So this is where I meet my end... It's sobering
:'''Tupac:''' Hahaha, when [[Tenoch]] summoned us, you should have seen this day coming. Hey, you recovered yet, Menilek?
:'''Menilek:''' Hehe, with a fierce battle to sober me up, I will be soon enough! Hahahaha...
:'''Wanjiru:''' Let's show the [[Abyss]]... That if they want to take our lives, it's gonna cost them dearly
:'''Mavuika:''' Friends, in this final battle, may you burn bright until the end. Natlan will remember this day
:;(The five of them engage in battle with the Abyss)
----
;(The scene cuts to black, followed by a weakened Tupac slowly carrying an injured Mavuika up the steps to the [[Sacred Flame]] at the Stadium)
:'''Tupac:''' Menilek's headlock was so strong, it outlived him. That giant beast suffocated to death because it couldn't break free from a dead man's grip...
:'''Tupac:''' And Sundjatta fell too soon...
:'''Tupac:''' If he hadn't taken that hit to save Wanjiru, he'd have lasted a lot longer...
:;(Mavuika awakens)
:'''Tupac:''' A senseless sacrifice — considering we were all gonna die anyway, hehehe...
:'''Mavuika:''' Tupac...?
:'''Tupac:''' Ah, you're awake... I knew you'd pull through
:'''Tupac:''' To keep the plan on track, I thought I'd give you a lift here...
:'''Mavuika:''' You're...
:'''Tupac:''' *cough* *cough* Look. We're almost there
:;(Tupac places Mavuika down)
:'''Tupac:''' You are our flame... You have to burn on
:'''Tupac:''' And never... go out...
:;(Mavuika sits down on her throne, before looking up to see Tupac standing motionlessly)
:'''Mavuika:''' Tupac...?
:;(Mavuika puts her hand on her throne, thereby placing her life into the Sacred Flame)
----
;(The scene cuts to an endless road in a desert, with Mavuika riding on her motorcycle into the sunset)
:'''Mavuika:''' That sunset is the only thing in sight
:'''Mavuika:''' I don't know how far I've come
:;(Mavuika drives by several benches that are in various states of disrepair)
:'''Mavuika:''' I don't even know where this road leads
:'''Mavuika:''' Where am I heading?
:;(Mavuika drives by more of such benches, with signs indicating various numbers, presumably showing the number of years since she placed her life into the Sacred Flame)
:'''Mavuika:''' I can't remember, I feel lost, but... this is the only road there is. I guess, maybe... I'll take a break
:;(Mavuika stops at a bench to find Hine there)
:'''Mavuika:''' ...Who are you? Why are you here?
:'''Hine:''' I'm waiting for sunset
:'''Mavuika:''' But it never sets here
:;(Hine takes a seat behind Mavuika)
:'''Hine:''' It will... when the time comes 
:;(Time passes as Mavuika continues to stay at the bench. Hine is playing with Mavuika's hair)
:'''Hine:''' Have you heard the saying? "After the evening flame burns away all evil, the peaceful night will finally arrive"
:'''Mavuika:''' The evening flame...
:'''Hine:''' Hey sis, you have a mission to do... remember?
:;(Mavuika stands up, seeming to have come to a realization)
:'''Mavuika:''' I do, there's people watching the sky... I can't keep them waiting
:'''Mavuika:''' ...Hine?
:;(Mavuika turns around to find Hine gone. She begins to walk to her motorcycle, the sign behind her indicating "499")
:'''Mavuika:''' That's right, I never lost my way. I'm still on track
:;(Mavuika drives her motorcycle into the sunset)
:'''Mavuika:''' My destination has been right there all along
----
;(The scene cuts to present-day Natlan, with Mavuika making a speech)
:'''Mavuika:''' We all have made many sacrifices, and faced our inner demons...
:'''Mavuika:''' But finally we are here
:;(The scene showcases the six present-day heroes of Natlan, alongside [[Aether]] and [[Paimon]])
:'''Mavuika:''' Natlan has suffered long enough
:;(The scene cuts to the present-day Stadium of the Sacred Flame)
:'''Mavuika:''' By nightfall, this war will be over
:'''Mavuika:''' ...For Natlan
