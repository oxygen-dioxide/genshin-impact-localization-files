'''Windtrace''' is an in-game [[event]] released in [[Version 1.5]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
2021-05-14 10:00:00 - 2021-05-24 03:59:59

===Requirements===
[[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above

===Summary===
During the event period, travelers can take part in a game of [[Windtrace]] at [[Gygax]]'s, and obtain [[Windtrace Coins]] to receive [[Primogem]]s, Event [[Namecard]] "Celebration: Peekaboo!", [[Character EXP Materials]], [[Mora]], and more.

On the first day of the event, the maximum number of [[Windtrace Coins]] you can carry is 1,200. This amount will increase by 600 for each of the 6 days after that, up to a maximum of 4,800 Windtrace Coins. Use the matching function to find randomized games and obtain Windtrace Coins.

Accumulate certain amounts of Windtrace Coins to claim the corresponding rewards. Complete Windtrace Challenges to obtain additional Mora rewards.

Before participating in the game, you must first unlock all of the [[Statues of the Seven]] located in the corresponding event areas. If you have not unlocked the Statues of the Seven of the corresponding areas, you will only be able to play games in the event areas where you have already unlocked them. You can view the unlocked event areas in the Contested Zone preview.

Windtrace Coins can only be obtained while playing in randomized games using the matching function. You will be unable to obtain Windtrace Coins while playing in a custom Co-Op party.

If you are a Rebel, then you must have the "Co-Op Teammate Effects" graphics setting set to "On" (not "Partially Off" or "Off") in order to see the Hunter's usage of the "Sensor Aura", "Mysterious Hunch", and "Capture!" Windward Arts.

===Tutorial===
[[File:Tutorial Windtrace 1.png|200px|thumb|left]] During the Windtrace event, players will be split into two sides to play the "Rebels" and the "Hunter."<br />The Rebels must avoid the Hunter's pursuit and hold out till the time expires.<br />The Hunter's task, on the other hand, is to capture all the Rebels within the stipulated time.{{clr}}
[[File:Tutorial Windtrace 2.png|200px|thumb|left]] The Rebels can use their Windward Arts to disguise themselves as designated objects within the current map, place bait, or temporarily enter a hidden state.<br />The various Arts of the Hunter can be used to detect the location of the opposing side and leave them shorn of their disguises.{{clr}}
[[File:Tutorial Windtrace 3.png|200px|thumb|left]] During the game, "Favors" will descend upon the area at random.<br />Picking up one such "Favor" will help charge one's "Secret Favor," an art that can be decisive in determining victory or defeat.{{clr}}
[[File:Tutorial Windtrace 4.png|200px|thumb|left]] Take part in Windtrace to obtain Windtrace Coins. Accumulate them to unlock all sorts of prizes.<br />When forming a custom Co-Op party to play this game or when your Windtrace Coins have reached the current maximum, you will not obtain any Windtrace Coins.{{clr}}

==Contested Zones==
When you participate in Windtrace, a Contested Zone will be randomly chosen from among the areas that have already been unlocked.{{clr}}
{| class="article-table tdc1"
! Name !! Description
|-
| [[File:Windtrace Small Town Guerilla War.png|200px]]<br />Small Town Guerilla War<br />[[Springvale]], [[Mondstadt]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|hay rolls and wooden crates}}.<br />
The clarion calls of conflict have been sounded in this small sleepy town by the resistance.<br />
The complicated terrain, rolls of hay, and haphazardly-placed wooden crates can help the Rebels get through this trying time.<br />
But the path that runs from the north to the south of the village is narrow indeed, and there is a high chance of running into a Hunter, so it is best to exercise caution!
|-
| [[File:Windtrace Winery Confrontation.png|200px]]<br />Winery Confrontation<br />[[Dawn Winery]], [[Mondstadt]]
| The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wine kegs and street lights}}.<br />
The contention between Rebels and Hunter plays out by the countryside manor.<br />
The tall structure and the dense vineyard rows are excellent places for the Rebels to cover their tracks. The nondescript wine kegs and streetlights will also serve as good concealment.
|-
| [[File:Windtrace Drifters in the Terrace Depths.png|200px]]<br />Drifters in the Terrace Depths<br />[[Qingce Village]], [[Liyue]]
| The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|dead wood and scarecrows}}.<br />
The battle between the resistance and the nobles continues in the village.<br />
The terraces at harvest time provide natural visual concealment, allowing those who disguise themselves as dead wood or scarecrows to blend right in.<br />
But the overall terrain is plain to see and the Hunter can reach the high ground to survey all beneath them and thus pick out any suspicious characters.
|-
| [[File:Windtrace Ghost-Fire Stream.png|200px]]<br />Ghost-Fire Stream<br />[[Wuwang Hill]], [[Liyue]]
| The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wine kegs and wooden crates}}.<br />
The chase continues even in the dark woods.<br />
Disguising oneself as wine kegs or wooden crates in an area populated by barely anyone is clearly not a smart call.<br />
Perhaps the darkness itself and the interference of the ghostly flames will provide some unexpected concealment...
|-
| [[File:Windtrace Ice-Sealed Maze.png|200px]]<br />Ice-Sealed Maze<br />[[Starglow Cavern]], [[Dragonspine]]
| The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wine kegs and wooden crates}}.<br />
Hunter and Rebel alike move from place to place, finally arriving in the [[Starglow Cavern]] deep within [[Dragonspine]].<br />
The ice-sealed cavern is cut off from the rest of the world, making ordinary disguises obvious by contrast, which provides a heretofore unencountered challenge for the Rebels.<br />
To add to this, both sides must constantly seek some semblance of warmth, making their contest ever more desperate!

==Tacit Observer Mode==
[[File:Windtrace Tacit Observer Mode Dialogue.png|200px|thumb|right]] Tacit Observer Mode was introduced in Windtrace as a spectator mode for captured Rebels. Observers can move around the map but cannot participate or be seen or heard by other players, including other Observers.

Observers are continually healed to full health.

Note that the text that shows up when Observers have their HP healed or take on an effect, such as {{Color|Wet}}, will still appear. In addition, all players can see when a barrier that repels players repels an Observer, although the Observer will not be visible.

==Other Notes==
* Characters cannot take fall damage during the game.
* If a Rebel dies while playing the game, it will count as a capture by the Hunter.
* If the Hunter dies while playing the game, then the Rebels will win.
* As in normal co-op, character audio, such as idle lines, audio from idle animations, and grunts, can be heard by other players if they are close enough. Disguises will prevent audio from being played. Observers' audio will not be heard.
* Equippable pets such as [[Mini Seelie: Dayflower]] will make noises even while Rebels are disguised. Observers' pets will not be heard.
* Resources that are present in the Windtrace world, such as [[butterflies]], can be picked up. Some resources appear to be present at first but disappear when the rebels' preparation phase begins.
* Windtrace is playable with custom co-op parties of as few as 2 people. Players who are not already in the host's world will not be added to the game.
