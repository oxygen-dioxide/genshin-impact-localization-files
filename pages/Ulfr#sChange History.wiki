[[Version 1.6]]
*One line of [[Traveler]]'s dialogue was revised.
**{{Color|Old:}} Hehe, it's as you say.<br />{{Color|New:}} Hehe, uh-huh! You're probably right.
* Ulfr's dialogue was revised.
** All instances of "Miss Flora" were changed to "Flora."
** A few lines of dialogue were revised.
***{{Color|Old:}} Ah, I guess you'd like to know why I'm so concerned about her?<br />{{Color|New:}} You must want to know why I'm so nice to Flora?
***{{Color|Old:}} Well, to tell you the truth, my parents separated when I was very young, so I always played by myself growing up.<br />{{Color|New:}} Well... it's like this. My parents separated when I was very young, and I spent much of my childhood on my own.
***{{Color|Old:}} So I thought to myself: if I had a little sister, she would definitely be light-hearted and bubbly, just like Flora...<br />{{Color|New:}} I sometimes imagined what it would be like to have a sibling, and the way I imagined them is exactly how Flora is: light-hearted, bubbly, and carefree...
***{{Color|Old:}} I hope that I can be kind to her like I would my very own sister.<br />{{Color|New:}} So, I just want to treat her like I would my own sibling, you know, do nice things for her.
***{{Color|Old:}} It sounds stupid, I know, but going boating together with family has always been my dream. My father practically laughs till he cries whenever I mention it to him, though. Why, that old man...<br />{{Color|New:}} It sounds stupid, I know, but I always wanted to go boating together as a family. My old man practically laughs till he cries whenever I mention it to him, though... Tsk, that old cynic...
***{{Color|Old:}} Still, I'm sure that Miss Flora wouldn't laugh at me.<br />{{Color|New:}} But, I'm sure that Flora wouldn't laugh at me like that.
***{{Color|Old:}} Hey, why are you suddenly copying the way she talks? That's rude!<br />{{Color|New:}} Hey, don't do impressions of Flora! That's disrespectful!
***{{Color|Old:}} I mean, if your goal doesn't move you, why would you even pursue it, right?<br />{{Color|New:}} You have to have some degree of admiration for your own goals, don't you? Otherwise, why would you pursue them?

** The "So, about Flora..." dialogue branch was added.
** One line of dialogue was revised:<br />{{Color|Old:}} One day, I will confess my love to Flora on board a dandelion boat... It's such a shame that my last few attempts have all sunk on their maiden voyages...<br />{{Color|New:}} Someday, I'll invite Flora to board a dandelion boat that I made myself... It's just a shame that they keep sinking.
