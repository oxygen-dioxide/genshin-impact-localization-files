;(Talk to Eugenie)
:'''Eugenie:''' Hmm, the fruit import negotiations went very well. Just a few more good games of Genius Invokation TCG and my trip to Mondstadt will be perfect!
:'''Eugenie:''' I'm looking for someone to play with. Would you like to have a friendly match?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Let's play Genius Invokation TCG!
:;(Open Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Eugenie:''' Okay! Don't forget to visit my fruit stall if you're ever in the Court of Fontaine!

;(If the player loses the match)
:'''Eugenie:''' Fresh decks are more sweet and sour than Valberries! You must be surprised!

;(If the player wins the match)
:'''Eugenie:''' No! Absolutely not! You play like a Lavender Melon... It's impossible to get a grasp on how to play against you!
