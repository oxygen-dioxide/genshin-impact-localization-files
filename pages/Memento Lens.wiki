'''Memento Lens''' is a gadget obtained during the [[World Quest]] [[Sacrificial Offering]].

The Memento Lens can be used on [[Earth Kitsune Statue]]s to reveal chests or investigation points, activate mechanisms, and reveal memories of bygone days. Statues that can be targeted have glowing Electro markings, will show up white when viewed with [[Elemental Sight]], and will cause the Memento Lens to glow when approached.

Using it on Earth Kitsune Statues will typically display the following screen prompt:
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
{{Dialogue End}}

As the basic usage of the Lens is not locked to Inazuma, the player can also use it as a spyglass to better view objects in the distance, which can be helpful for puzzle clues that are spread far apart.

The Hiiragis would have a special Kamera made to order from overseas with that catalyst mounted on its lens assembly, before giving it back to the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Faction)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] as a symbol of their friendship. That Kamera was said to have been able to record thoughts and memories, and though the complicated components may have rusted away over time, the specially-made lens can still see that which does not exist in the present world.|[[Archive]]}}
