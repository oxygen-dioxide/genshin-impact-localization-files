{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Licai:''' Welcome to Liuli Pavilion! How many are there in your group? Do you have a reservation?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Can I get food to-go?
::'''Licai:''' Certainly! You may enjoy our classic Li cooking wherever you choose.
:;(Opens the [[Liuli Pavilion#Shop|Liuli Pavilion Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon}} Is it always necessary to make a reservation?
::'''Licai:''' Yes, I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience. If you wish to eat inside the restaurant we ask that you make a reservation three months in advance. I will be sure to make a record of it.
::'''Licai:''' Oh? You think it's a long time to wait? At the Liuli Pavilion, we can only seat a few guests at certain times each day, hence the three month wait.
::'''Licai:''' Besides, for a chance to eat in Li cuisine paradise, surely three months is not too long...?
::'''Licai:''' People that come to Liuli Pavilion do so because they love eating the treasures of the mountains cooked in classic Li style. Everyone has to wait their turn, even the rich and famous.
::'''Licai:''' You can get food to go if you want, but you'll be missing out on the atmosphere.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Licai:''' Take care. Let me know promptly if you ever want to make a reservation!
