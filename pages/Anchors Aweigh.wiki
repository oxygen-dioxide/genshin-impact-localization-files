;(Talk to Bricole)
:'''Bricole:''' Oh, you're back. Well, and so am I...
:'''Bricole:''' After the [[Fontaine Research Institute|Institute]] heard my brief report, I was asked to assess the area for suitability as a quality development training ground alongside conducting my retrieval work.
:'''Bricole:''' *sigh* This all feels very familiar, somehow. I remember that there was a period of time when our Administrative Officer was very big on getting everyone to do diving training as well.
:'''Bricole:''' I personally think that it's all rather pointless, but work is work, I suppose, and a mission is a mission... Not to mention how this place is rather strange... I mean, unique.
:'''Bricole:''' As such, I've placed a few replica anchors in the area. Don't worry, they're just dummies. They're one-hundred-percent safe.
:'''Bricole:''' The content of the current training is to {{color|buzzword|retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit}}.
:'''Bricole:''' Would you like to give it a go? I can give you some compensation for taking part &mdash; you'll be assisting in research, after all.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Let me give it a try.
::'''Bricole:''' Alright, I'll time you. Don't forget, you need to {{color|buzzword|retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit}}, and then come find me.
:{{DIcon}} Never mind the challenge first. What happened to [[Coutrot]]?
::'''Bricole:''' Just being kicked out of the Fontaine Research Institute didn't bring him to his senses. He really is pigheaded.
::'''Bricole:''' But nobody is backing him now, so you can relax. He can't cause any more trouble.
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, who is [[Kuisel]]?
::'''Bricole:''' I don't know either. I don't recall anyone by that name at the Fontaine Research Institute... Perhaps, as far as he's concerned, it's better that nobody by that name exists?
::'''Bricole:''' Just like he said himself, Kuisel was just a convenient character. The more different that character was from himself, the better, as it made it less likely anyone would recognize him... Although that's just a guess of mine.
::'''Bricole:''' *Sigh* If you ask me, though, I think he changed enough over the years as it is. I didn't recognize him at first.
:{{DIcon}} Leaving the challenge aside, what about the devices here...
::'''Bricole:''' It's puzzling, isn't it? It seems like he's made... uh... various modifications to this place.
::'''Bricole:''' Now it feels more suited to some ancient ruins that tourists might visit... Although perhaps it isn't too prudent to say it like that.
::'''Bricole:''' *Ahem* The aforementioned viewpoint is only my personal opinion, and is not representative of the Fontaine Research Institute or its viewpoints.
:{{DIcon}} Forget it. You do your thing, alright?
::'''Bricole:''' Leaving so soon? Okay...
::'''Bricole:''' *sigh* This place starts to feel scary if you're alone here for too long...

;(Talk to Bricole again after starting the challenge, optional)
:'''Bricole:''' Alright, I'm timing you. Don't forget, you need to {{color|buzzword|retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit}}, and then come find me.

;(Talk to Bricole again after failing or abandoning the challenge)
:'''Bricole:''' Huh. Was the time limit too short? It seems even you found that rather tricky...
:'''Bricole:''' Would you like to try again? You just need to {{color|buzzword|retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit}}, and then come find me.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Alright, I'll give this another go.
::'''Bricole:''' Alright then, I'll be timing you, as before.
:{{DIcon}} Never mind the challenge first. What happened to Coutrot?
::'''Bricole:''' Just being kicked out of the Fontaine Research Institute didn't bring him to his senses. He really is pigheaded.
::'''Bricole:''' But nobody is backing him now, so you can relax. He can't cause any more trouble.
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, who is Kuisel?

;(Talk to Bricole after completing the challenge)
:'''Bricole:''' You got it! Looks like this challenge isn't impossible, after all! Guess I can submit this proposal to the Institute!
:'''Bricole:''' Shame that I haven't finished checking all the assets yet, so I'll have to come back here later.
:'''Bricole:''' But regardless, thanks for your help! Ah yes, and here's your reward. Safe travels, now!
