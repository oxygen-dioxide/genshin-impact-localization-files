==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shahin:''' People here are really bad at keeping a conversation going, so lame.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Shahin:''' Oh, hello! I rarely meet anyone here who would start a conversation with me.
::'''Shahin:''' Great hero, where are you from? What are you doing here?
::'''Shahin:''' I'm not making this up, the people in this garden are so boring. All they ever say to a question is "I don't know," "I'm not sure," and "Stop asking about it."
::'''Shahin:''' I expected working away from the city to be fun, but accepting work in the city with the [[Corps of Thirty]] seems much better now.
::{{DIcon}} About the Corps of Thirty...
::'''Shahin:''' They're the biggest group of the Eremites in Sumeru, and they mainly focus on work in [[Sumeru City]]. Even the color of their clothes isn't the same as ours, they look so much more stylish.
::'''Shahin:''' I don't know why they're called the Corps of Thirty, I've seen far more of them than that.
::'''Shahin:''' Maybe it's because they frequently collaborate with the Akademiya, and that air of seriousness has rubbed off on them, so I don't really like them.
::'''Shahin:''' *sigh* What's the point of saying all of that... Aren't I working for the Akademiya too... Haha...
::'''Shahin:''' Luckily, I'm not anywhere near the sages, so I have a little more freedom.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Shahin:''' Huh, are you ignoring me too?
