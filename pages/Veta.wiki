'''Veta''' is an open-world [[NPC]] located in the [[Court of Fontaine Region]], [[Fontaine]].

'''Veta''' is seen in [[Wriothesley]]'s [https://youtu.be/Pafx-AAYA_w&ab_channel=GenshinImpact Character Teaser: "Indispensable Protocols"] depicting the story of her father being escorted to the [[Fortress of Meropide|Fortress Of Meropide]] to serve his sentence. 

In the teaser, [[Wriothesley]] personally came to escort her father, pretending to be one of his colleagues. She is unaware of the real reason for her father's departure and she is patiently waiting for his return.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Veta:''' Wanna play a game with me?
:{{DIcon}} What game?
::'''Veta:''' A game of guessing your savings.
::'''Veta:''' I'll call out a number, and you can tell me if it's higher or lower than the correct number. Bet you'll get it in 3 guesses.
::{{DIcon}} This game might breach privacy...
:::'''Veta:''' Huh? C'mon, don't you trust me? I won't tell anyone else, honest!
:::'''Veta:''' I just want to know if I'm reading people right, you know?
:{{DIcon}} Why are you playing over here?
::'''Veta:''' My dad's a Snezhnayan envoy who's been posted to the [[Northland Bank]]. He won't let me run too far off.
::'''Veta:''' Look, that's the bank. It's between a [[Leschots Clockwork Workshop|clockwork workshop]] and the [[Lepaute Horlogerie|clock shop]]. Pretty awesome, isn't it?
::'''Veta:''' My dad's taught me how to distinguish between good and bad people, so don't worry, I'm not gonna go running off with bad people
:{{DIcon}} Next time, perhaps.
::'''Veta:''' Alright, guess I'll just play with someone else.
