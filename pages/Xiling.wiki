==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Xiling:''' She just threw you one look. No need to get this excited...
:{{DIcon}} Excited?
::'''Xiling:''' I'm talking about my buddy over here, blabbering on even though he only met her gaze briefly.
::'''Xiling:''' ...I'm her childhood friend, so by his logic, shouldn't I be over the moon every single day? Talk about exaggerating...
::{{DIcon}} You're her childhood friend?
:::'''Xiling:''' Yup, we actually grew up together. I even taught her fishing songs.
:::'''Xiling:''' Still, when I found out that she was the [[Beidou]] people call the Lord of the Ocean, even I was shocked.
:::'''Xiling:''' ...Now, I haven't seen her in a good long time. But there have been enough tales told about her for the oil to come running out of my ears.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Xiling:''' Mn, goodbye.
{{Dialogue end}}
