The '''Holy Lyre der Himmel''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained after completing the {{Quest|Chasing Shadows}}.

The Holy Lyre der Himmel was the lyre that the [[Anemo]] [[Archon]], [[Barbatos]], used to play. It is used in [[Ludi Harpastum]] and requires signed documents from the [[Varka|Grand Master]], [[Seamus|Seneschal]], and Community Representative to be used otherwise. According to [[Venti]], the frame is made of rosewood, with a pattern of flowing wind carved into it.

It becomes [[Partially Repaired Holy Lyre der Himmel|partially repaired]] during the {{Quest|State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel}}. However, towards the end of the Prologue, the Traveler and Venti return it to the [[Church of Favonius|Church]] in a worse condition following the encounter with [[Stormterror]]. While it is returned to the deaconess of the Church, [[Barbara]], Venti put an illusion spell upon it with the power of Anemo to seemingly repair it, right before hinting to the [[Traveler]] and [[Jean]] that it wouldn't last long and that they should leave.
