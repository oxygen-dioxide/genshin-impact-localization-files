The '''Holy Lyre der Himmel''' (German for "Holy Lyre of the Heavens") was the lyre that the [[Anemo]] [[Archon]], [[Barbatos]], used to play. It is used in [[Ludi Harpastum]] and requires signed documents from the [[Varka|Grand Master]], [[Seamus|Seneschal]], and Community Representative to be used otherwise. According to [[Venti]], the frame is made of rosewood, with a pattern of flowing wind carved into it.

It becomes [[Partially Repaired Holy Lyre der Himmel|partially repaired]] during the Archon Quest [[State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel]]. However, towards the end of the Prologue, the Traveler and Venti return it to the [[Church of Favonius|Church]] in a worse condition following the encounter with [[Stormterror]]. While it is returned to the deaconess of the Church, [[Barbara]], Venti put an illusion spell upon it to seemingly repair it, right before hinting to the [[Traveler]] and [[Jean]] that it wouldn't last and told them they should leave.
