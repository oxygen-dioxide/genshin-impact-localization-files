'''Enhanced Pneumousia Amplifiers''' are objects found in [[Fontaine]] and some floors in [[Spiral Abyss]].

==Overview==
Similar to [[Elemental Node]]s, every 15 seconds, an Enhanced Pneumousia Amplifier applies a 3 [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge units]] aura matching the Amplifier's element to all enemies in range. While they are still affected by the aura, they gain the following buffs:

* All [[RES]] are increased by '''60%''' and an additional '''60%''' for Amplifier's element.
* [[ATK]] is increased by '''25%'''.
* Cannot by [[Interruption Resistance|interrupted]].

Using [[Elemental Reaction]]s can eliminate the aura on the enemies, which will remove the buffs until the next interval where the Amplifier would reapply them again.

Enhanced Pneumousia Amplifiers have an [[Arkhe]] alignment, and hitting it with the opposite Arkhe will disable it for the remainder of combat.
