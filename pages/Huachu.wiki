==Profile==
Huachu is the second daughter of [[Gentry De'an]], who manages the [[Minghua Company]]. She fell in love with an arithmetic teacher named [[Jianqiu]], but her father disapproved of their relationship due to her lover's lower social standing.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Gentry De'an}}</ref>

In order to elope with Jianqiu, they conspired to fake her death. Using a corpse obtained through unknown means, they dressed it up as Huachu and left it inside the well at Feiyun Slope in [[Liyue Harbor]].<ref>{{Ref/BB|Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board|Water Pollution (Part 2)}}</ref> This polluted the water supply, leading the [[Millelith]] to discover it and conclude that the incident was Huachu's suicide. Unaware that she was actually alive and well, Gentry De'an grieved and decided to sell the [[Minghua Bank]]'s facilities to pay for her funeral.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board|Gentry De'an's Message}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Gentry De'an}}</ref>

::'''Huachu:''' Even the tea here tastes different from what I'm used to...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Huachu:''' Oh yes, sorry... I am the second daughter of the manager of the Minghua Company. Today, exceptionally, I have taken an excursion.
::'''Huachu:''' But with this being my first excursion ever, I am struggling to adapt.
::{{DIcon}} Just the two of you?
:::'''Huachu:''' Yes... Out of consideration for the business, I limited myself to a single travel partner.
::{{DIcon}} Where are you going?

==Trivia==
* [[Hongyi]], a Millelith guard in Chihu Rock, is greatly concerned about the water situation at Feiyun Slope. He is unaware that Huachu and Jianqiu caused it, nor is he aware that his fellow Millelith determined the source of the contamination to be the corpse she used to fake her death.
