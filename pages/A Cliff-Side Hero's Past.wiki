'''A Cliff-Side Hero's Past''' is a [[World Quest]] in [[The Chasm]], [[Liyue]].

==Steps==
Start the quest by picking up the [[Flower of Farsight]] as part of [[The Millennial Mountains]] quest.
# Defeat [[Tang Wuchou]].
#* {{Enemy|Treasure Hoarders: Carmen|text=Tang Wuchou - (Self Proclaimed) Guhua Hero}}
# Give the [[Bird Egg]] to Tang Wuchou in exchange for the jade pendant
# Look for [[Old Chou]]
# Dig for treasure once to get Old Chou's compensatory gift
#* Obtain [[Bag of Ornaments]]
# Talk to Old Chou
#* You will be given the option to teleport back to Tang Wuchou.
# Tell Tang Wuchou about Old Chou

==Notes==
* Completing this quest will grant the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Jack of No Trades]]."
* Digging up 3 treasure chests will grant the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Ding Ding Ding, We Have a Winner! Again!]]"

===Digging for Treasure Chests===
[[File:Digging Game.jpg|200px|thumb|Digging Spot Coordinates]]
After completing the quest, you may continue to dig for treasure chests. The 25 digging spots are arranged in a 5x5 square. See the image for coordinates. The game ends if you dig up an explosive barrel or a treasure chest. You may play the mini-game a certain number of times before you want to wait for the next day's reset.

This minigame is like Minesweeper:
* Digging up nothing means there are no mines in the surrounding cardinal directions.
* Digging up vegetables means there is one mine in the surrounding cardinal directions.
* Digging up ore means there are two mines in the surrounding cardinal directions.

As a result, it is suggested you '''do not''' pick up any items before you find a chest / exploding barrel; instead you should leave them as indicators.

A simple strategy is to start from the corners and work your way around. If you find yourself at an uncertain spot, try a different corner: the new clues given will hopefully reveal where the mines are.

In the quest version, you may continue digging even after digging up an explosive barrel. The [[Bag of Ornaments]] is found at '''C4'''.

The first, second, and third chests will be a Common Chest, Exquisite Chest, and Precious Chest respectively. The exact spot for the chest is not fixed. The recommended coordinates to dig are '''D5''', '''C3''', and '''A1'''.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the cliff where Tang Wuchou and the Flower of Farsight are)
:'''???:''' Huh! Hah! The mountains high, where the stars are nigh—!
:'''???:''' A fine abode for honing myself, indeed!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like there's some weirdo over there, (Traveler).

;(Talk to Tang Wuchou, optional)
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Ah, why do people covet my great [[Glaze Lily]] garden all day long? If any thieves dare approach, I shall surely have them taste the might of the [[Guhua Clan]]'s martial arts!
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|A Treasure Hoarder at the top of The Chasm claims to be from the Guhua Clan. Is he crazy, or is he just lost? Or is there some other secret that lies behind this situation?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Collect the Flower of Farsight)
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' What lowly folk are you? Do you not see that these flowers are kept by someone? How dare you pick them so casually!
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Cease this at once!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, so these flowers are...
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Indeed, they were found by mine keen and discerning eye, and watched over thusly for three days!
:'''Paimon:''' ...Not planted by you.
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' *cough* No indeed, but they are mine now.
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Verily did I even swear in my heart that I shall care for these flowers and create a lovely and great Glaze Lily garden, far from the strictures and standards of the norm!
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, you're going to make a Glaze Lily garden... with these flowers?
:'''Paimon:''' But...
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' What of it? Do you think that I am but a rough person bereft of any sense of aesthetics?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Pah! To think that you would judge books by their covers so.
:'''Paimon:''' It's not that. It's just that you say you want to create a Glaze Lily garden... though these flowers are actually [[Qingxin]].
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' ...Eh?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' ...
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' ...Hehehehehe, hahahaha!
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' I get it now, I get it! You're trying to shake my will, aren't you?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' But alas for you! I am Tang Wuchou, true disciple of the 320th Guhua Clan generation! Did you really think that you could fool me with such shallow trickery?
:{{DIcon}} Does the Guhua Clan really have that many generations of pupils...
::'''Tang Wuchou:''' How dare you insult the long and venerable history of the Guhua Clan! Have at ye, scoundrels!
:{{DIcon}} You say that, when you're dressed like a Treasure Hoarder...
::'''Tang Wuchou:''' Hmph, and what are clothes but things we wear? A person should be judged by the quality of their heart.
::'''Tang Wuchou:''' I, Tang Wuchou of the Guhua Clan, must today do a great justice in defeating you two flower thieves. Witness now the might of the Guhua Clan!

;(After defeating Tang Wuchou)
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Ow, ow, ow ow ow... I'm sorry, I'm sorryyyy! Stop hitting me, please!
:'''Paimon:''' This person's martial skills...
:{{DIcon}} ...Are a complete wash.
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' To think that I, with my many long years of training, would not be your match all the same...
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Ah, yes. They say "a fine saddle for a fine horse, a fair sail for a fair boat"... No, wait, that's not it...
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' "A fine sword for a fair hero," that's how it went! So yes, please take this Glaze Lily with you, O mighty hero...
:'''Paimon:''' Didn't we already say that these are Qingxin?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Ah, yes, yes, Qingxin, Qingxin indeed. It is as you say...
:'''Paimon:''' Are you really from the Guhua Clan? ...Hmm, right, do you know some guy called [[Xingqiu]]?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Xingqiu...
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' I have never heard this name. What, does this Xingqiu person call himself a Guhua disciple?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Ah, how could such a knave be allowed to sully the Guhua name...
:'''Paimon:''' (Right, so he isn't from the Guhua Clan. Actually, y'know, isn't he the one sullying the Guhua name around here?)
:'''Paimon:''' One moment, please. Do you have any proof of your claim that you're from the Guhua Clan?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Of course I do, yes! Come now, look at this jade pendant I have on me...
:'''Paimon:''' So this is a hereditary treasure of the Guhua Clan?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' This jade pendant was sold to me by an old friend when we parted, and that was when I decided in my heart that it should become just such a hereditary treasure.
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Since I began wearing this jade pendant, I feel a dull headache every time I practice martial arts.
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh...
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds like this jade pendant has some issues...
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Bah, nonsense! The first day I wore it, an adeptus came to me in a dream and taught me the secret arts of the Guhua Clan. The adeptus even said that it was fated that the pendant should have come into my possession.
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' The pains I feel in my head are merely growing pains, signs that my consciousness is expanding. That's what the novels say, after all! These are the signs that my thoughts and my will are growing stronger. There can be no problems here!
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Unless... Ah, right, yes, I get it!
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' ...Hehehehehe, hahahaha!
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' I see now! You want this jade pendant, but are too afraid to ask, yes? Thus, you seek to use this so-called "problem" as an excuse. How very "moral" of you... I mean, how very polite of you!
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' But nay, this is the Guhua Clan's great treasure. If you wish to claim it from me, you must...
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' ...You must surely exchange it for something of equal value! Yes! Like a gem the size of a pigeon egg, or something! What would I do about my wounded pride as the 320th-generation disciple of the Guhua Clan otherwise?
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like it's this weird pendant thing that's made this guy believe that he's a Guhua disciple, (Traveler)... and it's driving him kinda nuts, too.
:'''Paimon:''' If he keeps wearing that pendant... and keeps staying this far above ground, something terrible's gonna happen to him for sure.
:'''Paimon:''' So he wants us to get him some "gem the size of a pigeon egg," eh? But he doesn't look like he can tell left from right or good from bad right now...
:'''Paimon:''' So let's try giving him a few Bird Eggs, shall we?

:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Well? Like I said, if you can offer an item of equal value, I can give this to you, no problem.
:{{DIcon}} (Well, let's try giving him a Bird Egg...)
::''Open item inventory''

;(After giving Tang Wuchou the bird egg)
:'''Paimon:''' There you go, we'll trade this for that jade pendant.
:'''Paimon:''' This is a... gemstone, the size of a bird's egg, you know!
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' The size of a bird's egg? Why, I never... I thought that a gem the size of a pigeon's egg was as large as they could get, but a bird's egg...?
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' Hehehe, a jade pendant for such a large gem. What a deal!
:'''Tang Wuchou:''' And this, naturally, is thanks to the magnanimous inclination of us Guhua disciples&mdash; I mean, it was on account of your great sincerity! Yes! Your great sincerity, that led us to make this trade.

:'''Tang Wuchou takes the pendant off and passes it to you...'''

:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' As for this jade pendant, you take it. Your destiny is intertwined with that of us of the Guhua Clan, it seems, so do take care of this treasure.
:'''Paimon:''' Hahaha, where'd that expression of discontent on your face go, eh?
;(If Baizhu has been talked to [[A Teapot to Call Home: Part I]])
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, this thing is filled with Geo energy... Isn't this Smaragdus Jadeite?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers Baizhu saying something about it... Not that Paimon remembers it in full, but whatever it was, this stuff isn't all that good for people.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, this thing is filled with Geo energy...
::'''Paimon:''' Most normal people don't come into contact with elemental energy in their daily lives. There's bound to be trouble if they stay beside such a huge concentration of energy all the time.
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' That's not possible. My sworn brother bought this for me... How could he seek to harm me?
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' And he has made so many other ornaments from jade to boot...
:'''Paimon:''' Your friend, you say?
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' That's right. We call him [[Old Chou]]. He works in the jade industry.
:{{DIcon}} Where is he right now?
::'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' He should be near The Chasm. Last I heard, he's still helping to sell ornaments made from jade...
:{{DIcon}} Is he still selling those ornaments?
::'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' I'm not sure, but I do know that we can find him near The Chasm...
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), if that person's still selling ornaments made from Smaragdus Jadeite, there could be a lot of people being put in harm's way.
:'''Paimon:''' We'd better go down there and check!

;(Talk to Tang Wuchou again)
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Ah, who'd have thought, who'd have thought? That the world might play host to a gem the size of a bird's egg?
----
;(Talk to Old Chou)
:'''Old Chou:''' Ah, hello there, you two. Is there anything I can help you with?
:'''Old Chou:''' Are you here to try your hand at digging for treasure, just for a bit of fun?
:'''Paimon:''' Nope. We've got something else to talk to you about today.
:{{DIcon}} This jade pendant...
:{{DIcon}} You sold this, yes?
:'''Old Chou:''' Ah, this jade pendant...
:'''Old Chou:''' Yes, I did indeed sell it here. Let me have a look at it... Wait a moment. This texture, this smoothness, this translucence... Isn't this the very one I sold to Tang Wuchou?
:'''Old Chou:''' Aye, indeed, I knew from the start that this one was different from the others.
:'''Old Chou:''' At the time, I had wanted to sell it for a pretty sum, but it caught Tang Wuchou's eye, and so he begged and cajoled me... until I sold it to him on the cheap.
:'''Paimon:''' So there's only one that looks like this?
:'''Old Chou:''' I sure wish I could pull a second one out of my hat, that's for sure.
:'''Paimon:''' Phew! Good thing it was just this one! This material is filled with elemental energy. If someone without a Vision is in contact with it, they will experience changes in personality and start talking nonsense day in and day out...
:'''Paimon:''' Tang Wuchou currently believes himself to be a great hero of the Guhua Clan, and spends his days behaving all crazy and stuff.
:'''Old Chou:''' What? H&mdash;How could this be?
:'''Old Chou:''' ...Actually, now that you mention it, this gem is the fabled "Smaragdus Jadeite." That material was said to cause its wearers some discomfort.
:'''Old Chou:''' I heard the older folks say while Smaragdus Jadeite is very valuable, it is a thing of ominous portents, and that long-term exposure will bring about calamity.
:'''Old Chou:''' ...Oh no. I've doomed Tang, haven't I?
:'''Old Chou:''' *sigh* We were both Treasure Hoarders once. We decided to part ways after making a pretty sum at The Chasm.
:'''Old Chou:''' I do not know where Tang Wuchou went off to, but as for me... I was found by our former companions. They threatened me, and forced me to buy the low-quality jewelry they make here and sell it in Liyue.
:'''Old Chou:''' They call it "helping with sales," but really... are the materials they use the equal of Shenglu Hall? Or their designs a match for Mingxing Jewelry?
:'''Old Chou:''' They're just making me do the dirty work for them.
:'''Old Chou:''' I had to lower the price so much that I was practically losing Mora on sales.
:'''Old Chou:''' I basically used up all the Mora I made in our previous job... But it seems like those fellows have finally woken up to the idea that they might sell the base materials for a better price. They haven't come to look for me at all recently.
:''(If the player has completed [[Undetected Infiltration]])''
:{{DIcon}} Actually, they've all been captured by Millelith who infiltrated their ranks.
::'''You tell Old Chou about the destruction of the smuggling den...'''
::'''Old Chou:''' Hah! That was a good catch for sure, that was!
::'''Old Chou:''' They even threatened to report me to the Millelith too, you know! Now look who's going to eat prison food, hmm?
:'''Old Chou:''' ... *sigh* Sorry, I got off topic. I'm very sorry about Tang, but I... I've buried all my valuables in the dirt... You know, to do a little business, earn a little Mora?
:'''Old Chou:''' How about this, then? I'll let you dig for treasure once. You can give whatever you find to Tang Wuchou as compensation.

:'''Old Chou:''' The game's begun! Get digging in that plot of land on my left!

;(Talk to Old Chou again)
:'''Old Chou:''' Well, how about a round of treasure-hunting, right now? Whatever you dig up will go to Tang Wuchou as compensation.

;(Digging up an [[Exploding Barrel]])
:'''Old Chou:''' You dug up a bunch of explosives. Game over! Game&mdash; OK, fine, I'll let you go this time. Just dig away.

;(Obtain [[Bag of Ornaments]])

;(Talk to Old Chou)
:'''Old Chou:''' Well, let's have a look. What did you get?
:'''Old Chou:''' Oh, so you actually got this bag, huh...
:'''Paimon:''' What's inside...?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh. Uh, these ornaments are kinda...
:{{DIcon}} ...Ghastly.
:'''Old Chou:''' Well, they were made by the Treasure Hoarders, and proved just about as popular as their makers.
:'''Old Chou:''' But if nothing else, they're still made of genuine materials, so you can still cut those gems out and sell them for a pretty sum... *sigh*
:'''Old Chou:''' Just give this to Tang, will you?
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, we're off, then!
:'''Old Chou:''' Aye. If you have the time, come around and dig for some more treasure, alright?

:'''Paimon:''' Should we go back now, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, let's go back and look for Tang Wuchou...
::''Teleport back to Tang Wuchou''
:{{DIcon}} Let's pass it to him later...
----
;(Talk to Tang Wuchou)
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Hey-ho! This gem is as large as a bird's egg, yes, but it is so very light!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' And when you hold it up against the light, you can see a shadow within! Fascinating, how very fascinating...
:'''Paimon:''' He's still looking at that egg, huh..
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Mr. Guhua Hero!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Sorry, what? Ah, yes! That's me, Tang Wuchou, 320th-generation successor to the Guhua Clan! Surely you must have come hence upon hearing of my great deeds...
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Eh? Oh, it's you two. Right, how about it, then? Did you find Old Chou?
:{{DIcon}} We did find him, yes...
:{{DIcon}} Let's start from the top, shall we...

:'''You tell Tang Wuchou about Smaragdus Jadeite and give him Old Chou's compensatory gift.'''

:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' That's one huge bag... Lemme see what's in it, eh?
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' What in the world is with all these ornaments? ...And they're all so...
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' ...Ugly.
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' What, is Old Chou trying to make a fool of me? Huh?
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' That jade pendant made from Smaragdus Jadeite cost me lots of Mora! And he even kept contact with those sneaky Treasure Hoarders after supposedly washing his hands off the business!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' ...Ah, this ancient grudge... I might just have to cut him down for it.
:'''Paimon:''' And you call yourself a hero...
:'''Paimon:''' Wasn't that jade pendant something you wanted to buy yourself, anyway?
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' ...
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' ...Hehehehehe, hahahaha!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' You have a point.
:'''Paimon:''' And it's not like he's got anything to do with the Treasure Hoarders anymore. He's opened a store to let people try their hand at digging for treasure.
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Digging for treasure? ...Pfft, so he's doing that again... He used to pull that trick to get Mora for wine.
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Let me tell you something... That treasure hunt of his works like this: the {{Color|buzzword|better the goods, the more explosive barrels there will be around it, and vice versa.}}
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' For example, tiles that turn out to be empty won't have a single explosive barrel near it, while the best stuff is probably surrounded on all four sides by such barrels.
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Stingy fellow. He's deathly afraid that someone will get their hands on the good stuff, so he set the rules up such that the game ends once you dig up one explosive barrel.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, but he said that he'd just let us keep going this time even if we dug them up...
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Is... is that so? Well... I suppose there's some goodness left in his heart yet.
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' *sigh* Fair enough. And if I had been there with him back then, my martial prowess would have prevented him from being manipulated by those Treasure Hoarders the way he was...
:{{DIcon}} Your what now?
:{{DIcon}} Your martial prowess?
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' *cough* I mean, come on, I am a martial artist. There might still be some distance between me and a true hero, but I can still handle a few Treasure Hoarders, no problem!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' I'll go look for him later with two jugs of wine next time, I suppose, and we'll have a chat then.

;(Talk to Tang Wuchou again)
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' What, did you get stumped by Old Chou's games again?
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' C'mon, I told you already... That treasure hunt of his works like this: the {{color|buzzword|better the goods, the more explosive barrels there will be around it, and vice versa.}}
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Got it this time?
