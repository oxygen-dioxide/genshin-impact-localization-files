'''Trounce Domains''' are [[Domains]] containing powerful [[Weekly Bosses]] that can be re-challenged after completing their respective [[Archon Quest|Archon]] or [[Story Quest|Story]] Quests. They can be accessed on all days of the week.
* Trounce Domains contain unusually powerful opponents. After successfully completing the challenge, you can obtain abundant rewards.
* Players can complete this domain as many times as they want, but can only collect rewards once per week by using {{Item|Original Resin|30|x=30}} to open the [[Ley Line Blossom]] for the first three Weekly Bosses, and {{Item|Original Resin|30|x=60}} subsequently. Rewards are refreshed with [[Reset#Weekly World Reset|Weekly World Reset]].
