'''Thunder Dwellings''' are objects that can be charged with the power of {{Color|Electro}}. They have appeared during the [[Thunder Sojourn]] event as well as in the {{Quest|"Fang of Watatsumi"}}.

Each [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge]] of {{Electro}} applied to it, or each second that a player carrying an [[Electrogranum]] or affected by {{Electro}} spends near it, will charge the Thunder Dwelling by 10%.

When fully charged, they deal {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} to both players and enemies. The DMG to the player can be negated if the player is carrying an Electrogranum. The explosion also applies a debuff to enemies for '''10s''' which reduces their [[Damage Reduction]] by '''50%'''.

| During the Lightning Round challenge, you will encounter the special Thunder Dwelling. Characters in proximity to the Thunder Dwelling who are carrying {{Color|Electrograna}}, are {{Color|affected by Electro}}, or {{Color|use an Electro attack on it}} will charge the dwelling's energy.

| Once the Thunder Dwelling is fully charged, it will release a Thunder Shock, dealing {{Color|Electro DMG}} to all characters and opponents present on the battlefield. If the Thunder Shock hits an opponent, it will cause them to take more DMG for a period of time. The Thunder Dwelling will be unable to recharge for a brief period after unleashing its Thunder Shock.
