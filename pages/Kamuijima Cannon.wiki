{{Lang|'''Kamuijima Cannon'''|ja=神居島崩砲}} is a device found in [[Kannazuka]], [[Inazuma]]. It is unlocked while completing the [[Tatara Tales (Quest)|Tatara Tales]] Quest. Kamujima Cannons can be operated to fire projectiles that deal {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

==Damage==
{{Environmental Damage|25|Kamuijima Cannon Projectiles}}

==Story==
It is powered by Electro and was installed by the [[Shogunate]] on [[Kannazuka]] in their war against the [[Watatsumi Army]]. However, it had limited range and was hard to move, making it easy for the Sangonomiya rebels to make it past the cannons and take down the guards at [[Mikage Furnace]]. Because of this, over time, the cannons mostly went out of use.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales (Quest)}}</ref>

==Quests==
*[[Tatara Tales (Quest)|Tatara Tales]]: Involves firing 3 Kamuijima Cannons situated in the locations on the [[Kamuijima Cannon Map]] to destroy the protective barrier around Mikage Furnace.

==Notes==
*The southernmost cannon is required to break the rockface to gain access to the [[Shakkei Pavilion]] domain.
*The Central and Southern cannons can be used to destroy patches of terrain to reveal chests etc.
** There is no real visual indication that terrain is breakable, excluding that there is a solid patch of rock wall. Upon impact, the terrain will glow brightly for a few seconds if something was revealed.
*The cannons can be used against other players in [[Co-Op Mode]], dealing {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} per cannonball.
**The same principle can be used to damage enemies, although none of them are in range to be hit apart from a pair of ronin by the southern cannon.
