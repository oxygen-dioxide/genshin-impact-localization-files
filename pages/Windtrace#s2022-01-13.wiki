{{Description|Windtrace, the classic game that hands down Mondstadt's history, is once again being held!}}
'''Windtrace''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 2.4]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2022/01/13 10:00 â€“ 2022/01/27 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above

===Summary===
*During the event period, Travelers can take part in a game of [[Windtrace]] at Gygax's, and obtain [[Windtrace Coins]] to receive rewards such as [[Primogem]]s, [[Talent Level-Up Materials]], [[Character EXP Materials]], and [[Mora]].
* On the first day of the event, the maximum number of Windtrace Coins you can obtain is 1,200. This amount will increase gradually for each of the 6 days after that, up to a maximum of 6,000 Windtrace Coins. Use the matching function to find randomized games and obtain Windtrace Coins.
* Accumulate certain amounts of Windtrace Coins to claim the corresponding rewards. Complete Windtrace Challenges to obtain additional Mora rewards.
* When participating in Windtrace, the unlocked "Contested Zone" will be randomly selected for the game. Travelers can unlock the "Contested Zone" by unlocking the [[Statue of the Seven]] in the corresponding area. The "Contested Zones" in [[Inazuma]] can only be unlocked by completing the Quest "[[Ritou Escape Plan]]" and unlocking the Statue of the Seven in the area. Travelers can view the currently unlocked content through the preview of the "Contested Zone" in the game overview.
* Windtrace Coins can only be obtained while playing in randomized games using the matching function. You will be unable to obtain Windtrace Coins while playing in a custom Co-Op party.
* [[Kamisato Ayaka]] and [[Mona]]'s [[Alternate Sprint]]s cannot be used in this Windtrace.

|-
| [[File:Windtrace 2022-01-13 Central Hall Shadow-Chasers.png|200px]]<br />Central Hall Shadow-Chasers<br />[[Kamisato Estate]], [[Inazuma]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wooden basins, wooden barrels, and lamps}}.<br />The resistance once set up overseas support branches, fearing the worst for their chances back home. Following rumors of their presence, the Hunters would gave chase. These support teams had the highest measure of vigilance against their pursuers, and were ready at any time to engage them in what is now the Yashiro Commission grounds. Though much time has passed and the building has changed greatly, the courtyard layout is nonetheless quite similar &mdash; certainly enough to hone any Rebel's techniques!
|-
| [[File:Windtrace 2022-01-13 Amidst Autumn Trees.png|200px]]<br />Amidst Autumn Trees<br />[[Higi Village]], [[Inazuma]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wooden basins, vases, and water tanks}}.<br />The resistance hiding out in the rural villages are holding a training session, such that they may be ready to stand against the keenest hunters in the most perilous circumstances. The dilapidated houses, the scattered items, and the vision-obscuring red leaves provide ample room for covering one's tracks!
|-
| [[File:Windtrace 2022-01-13 The Hidden Trials.png|200px]]<br />The Hidden Trials<br />[[Kujou Encampment]], [[Inazuma]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|archery targets, wine barrels, and Otogi Wood boxes}}.<br />The most guarded place is also the safest place. A mock battle based on a military camp in Kannazuka is about to take place! The hard-to-attack, easy-to-defeat terrain and the voluminous defenses introduce countless variables into the equation, and the well-designed encampment is also an ideal spot for ambushes. Both sides need to be cautious!
|-
| [[File:Windtrace 2022-01-13 Ritou Runaround.png|200px]]<br />Ritou Runaround<br />[[Ritou]], [[Inazuma]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|storage sacks, wine barrels, Otogi Wood boxes, and short stools}}.<br />The resistance would often have to meet with their contacts to keep abreast of the situation. The wily Hunters would also switch tacks to tail these informants, thus exposing the Rebels by extension. As such, even the busy, prosperous harbor could become a contested area. These pedestrian streets were good for concealing oneself, but they also greatly shortened distances and the reaction times required. Danger lay in wait around every corner...
|-
| [[File:Windtrace 2022-01-13 Terrace Patrol.png|200px]]<br />Terrace Patrol<br />[[Qingce Village]], [[Liyue]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|dead wood and scarecrows}}.<br />The terraced fields during harvest were not only excellent places for the resistance forces to conceal themselves but an excellent source of materials that could be used in the grueling struggle against the aristocracy. Of course, the Hunters would also watch this place, and they would dispatch elites to encircle the weaker Rebels...
|-
| [[File:Windtrace 2022-01-13 Searching the Silent Woods.png|200px]]<br />Searching the Silent Woods<br />[[Starfell Valley]], [[Mondstadt]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|old wooden boxes, and old wooden barrels}}.<br />The resistance operated in the woods near Mondstadt, right under their enemies' noses, taking advantage of this particular blind spot to great effect. After a time, however, the old aristocracy would discover these discrepancies and dispatch elite Hunters to investigate. The fierce battle beneath the silent trees is about to begin!
|-
| [[File:Windtrace 2022-01-13 In a City of Yore Concealed.png|200px]]<br />In a City of Yore Concealed<br />[[Sea of Clouds]], [[Liyue]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|old wooden boxes, old wooden barrels, and stone lamps}}.<br />The ruins and old abandoned wrecks would often be overlooked by the aristocracy due to their extreme danger and the harsh living conditions there, which made them difficult places to hide in. However, some survivalist Rebels would take advantage of this view to set up a base there. However, some Hunters with extremely good instincts would come to such places to conduct independent investigations. Thus would some unexpected confrontations come to be...
|-
| [[File:Windtrace 2022-01-13 Winery Clash.png|200px]]<br />Winery Clash<br />[[Dawn Winery]], [[Mondstadt]]
|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wine barrels, street lamps, and chairs}}.<br />Delectable wines are Mondstadt's key exports, and each bottle may as well be worth its weight in Mora. Of course, this meant that both sides viewed it as a strategic resource. Ever since the resistance networks were active, clashes around large-scale wineries never stopped. The fighting over the large buildings at the core of such operations was exceptional fierce in that regard.

==Windward Arts==
All original Combat Talents will be replaced with "Windward Arts". Travelers can select the Windward Arts they want to use before the game starts.

Secret Favors are Windward Arts that can be picked up that replace the Elemental Burst.

===Rebel===
* If you play as a Rebel in the game, after the game starts, you must constantly move and hide to avoid the Hunter until the time limit is up. The longer a Rebel remains uncaught, the more Windtrace Coins obtained. At the end of the stipulated time, if one or more Rebels are left on the field, victory goes to the Rebels.
* During the preparation phase, the Rebels need to quickly find good hiding spots, use their Windward Arts to disguise themselves as designated objects within the current map, place bait, or cleverly use the environment to hide and evade the Hunter.

===Hunter===
* If you play as a Hunter in the game, after the game starts, your task is to capture all the Rebels within the stipulated time. The various Arts of the Hunter can be used to detect the location of the opposing side and leave them shorn of their disguises.
* The more Rebels a Hunter captures in the game and the less time it takes to capture the Rebels, the more Windtrace Coins obtained. At the end of the stipulated time, if the Hunter captures all the Rebels, victory goes to the Hunter.
* During the preparation phase of Windtrace, the Hunter is enclosed within an opaque blue wall. They cannot leave the enclosure, nor can they see where the Rebels go. However, the opaque blue wall is short enough that in certain maps, Rebels in very high locations may be spotted from within the enclosure.
* After the activity starts, the Stamina consumed by the Hunter in sprinting, climbing, and gliding will be greatly reduced.
* The Hunter's usage of the "Sensor Aura", "Mysterious Hunch", and "Capture!" Windward Arts is visible to all Rebels who have the "Co-Op Teammate Effects" graphics setting set to "On" (not "Partially Off" or "Off").

==Other Notes==
* Characters cannot take fall damage during the game.
* If a Rebel dies while playing the game, it will count as a capture by the Hunter.
* If the Hunter dies while playing the game, then the Rebels will win.
* As in normal co-op, character audio, such as idle lines, audio from idle animations, and grunts, can be heard by other players if they are close enough. Disguises will prevent audio from being played. Observers' audio will not be heard.
* Equippable pets such as [[Mini Seelie: Dayflower]] will make noises even while Rebels are disguised. Observers' pets will not be heard.
* Resources that are present in the Windtrace world, such as [[butterflies]], can be picked up. Some resources appear to be present at first but disappear when the rebels' preparation phase begins.
* Windtrace is playable with custom co-op parties of as few as 2 people. Players who are not already in the host's world will not be added to the game.

===Tacit Observer Mode===
* Observers can move around the map but cannot participate or be seen or heard by other players, including other Observers.
* Observers are continually healed to full health.
** This healing triggers the 4-piece effect of [[Ocean-Hued Clam]]. The bubble deals damage to any nearby entities that can be damaged.
* The text that shows up when Observers have their HP healed, lose HP, or take on an effect, such as {{Color|Wet}}, will still appear.
