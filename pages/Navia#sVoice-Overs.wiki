You strike me as somebody special &mdash; a person of character.

It means we have to drop everything, right now, and make a run for the ice cream store!

|vo_06_01_tx         = Some people call me "Boss," others "Demoiselle," but none of that does anything for me. My favorite thing to be called is "partner" &mdash; but only by you, of course. So, just know that my vainer side would be over the moon if you could indulge me a little more often.

|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Keeping Secrets.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = People say that a secret shared is a secret no more, but I like to think that true friends keep each other's secrets. ...What? Veiled threat? No, of course not! Granted, as president of Spina di Rosula, I do have my ways of making people keep their mouths shut, but don't worry &mdash; I promise not to use those on you.

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = Here, take a look at my Vision! I love how shiny it is. Doesn't it go great with my dress?<br>Still, it's nothing compared to using the elements without a Vision... And with no training or anything either, right? So cool.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share: Dogs
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Dogs.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = My favorite dog breed of all is the [[Chestnut Hunting Hound|chestnut hunting hound]]. You know how they have the little spots above their eyes? They look just like eyebrows, don't they? That's why they look so innocent and earnest all the time. Please keep this a secret for me, though &mdash; I don't wanna hurt the other dogs' feelings!

|vo_07_03_title      = Something to Share: The Dependable Spina di Rosula
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - The Dependable Spina di Rosula.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = If you've spent long enough in the [[Fleuve Cendre]], you might have noticed that there are a lot of other groups in [[Fontaine]] besides the Spina di Rosula. Beware of them &mdash; they each have their own agenda, and they're not all friendly like us. If you ever find yourself in a tight spot, you can always ask Mr. [[Tetreaux]] at the bar for help. Unless you're dealing with someone who isn't in the mood to sit down and have a conversation, in which case... [[Sonny|White Glove]] will sort things out. You can count on him.

|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Clorinde.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = She might not say much, or show a lot of emotion, but I can tell that she feels deeply. After my [[Callas|father]]'s death, I... well, it caused quite a rift between us for a long time. But even then, I never did like having her constantly walking on eggshells around me... I much prefer how things are now.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Callas,Clorinde

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Charlotte]]
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Charlotte.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Charlotte's known for her fast-and-furious reporting, but it's her photography skills that really impress me. She once snapped a quick photo of me, a waist-up shot, and the result was absolutely stunning &mdash; it was like looking at an oil painting. She seems to have a knack for writing extraordinary news stories and taking the most eye-catching photos. Guess she was born to be a journalist.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Charlotte

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Chiori]]
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Chiori.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = Ah, the fashion designer who brought the coolest [[Inazuma]]n trends to Fontaine? She's actually been a great help to the Spina behind the scenes. She says my unorthodox ideas always give her a lot of inspiration for her work, and from what I can tell, I think she means it. Still, she drew the line at my request for a ten-meter-tall top hat. *sigh* Missed opportunity, if you ask me... Imagine seeing one of those in front of the shop! It would be a great way to draw in customers.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Chiori

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Furina]]

|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Furina.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = I was lucky enough to catch her in an opera when I was young. Even though it was a charity show, the tickets were nearly impossible to get! She was performing in character then, but I thought she seemed more in her element then than she ever did as an [[Archon]], giving speeches up in the opera box... Looking back, I guess my intuition was right.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Furina

|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Neuvillette.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = Ah, how to describe Monsieur Neuvillette... He's... complex, in some ways &mdash; but very straightforward in others. I guess a good analogy would be rocky reefs in the sea: Trying to navigate through obstacles you can't see makes for a bumpy ride, but if you can figure out how they work, you start to spot the signs.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Neuvillette

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Wriothesley]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Wriothesley.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = Trying to discuss anything with that guy is an exhausting process. [[Clorinde]] says I needn't have any reservations about collaborating with him in the scope of our preexisting agreement, but I still shouldn't trust everything that comes out of his mouth. No wonder my father never tried to get involved with the affairs of the Fortress... I think I'll play it safe and keep things that way.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Wriothesley, Clorinde, Callas

|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About The Knave.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = She is a formidable but caring leader, and definitely comes across like a master of the house. But she's still a [[Fatui Harbinger]], and that means she must have a more ruthless side. So don't worry &mdash; while I'll always appreciate what she did for [[Poisson]], I'm not about to let my guard down around her completely.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Arlecchino

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Lyney]] and [[Lynette]]
|vo_08_08_quest      = Masquerade of the Guilty
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Lyney and Lynette.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = I know magicians can often be all bravado and razzmatazz, but I can tell that Lyney is a sincere guy who cares deeply about his friends and family. He's so mature for his age, it catches me off guard sometimes... Oh, and how could I forget &mdash; it was so kind of him to try and cheer up the children in Poisson with an impromptu free magic show during the flood! I'll have to invite him and Lynette over for some macarons at my place when I get the chance. I know Lynette's always conjuring teacups out of thin air, so surely at least she's a fan of a proper tea break?
|vo_08_08_mention    = Lyney,Lynette

Some veterans of the Spina think that I'm becoming more and more like him, but I think the trend they're referring to is a superficial one, born out of the simple fact that some problems only have so many solutions.
