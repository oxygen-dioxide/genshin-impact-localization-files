{{Description|The huge cone is like a supporting pillar between the high sky and the yellow sands that has stood in the middle of the desert since time immemorial. Standing in front of it, be you a commoner, a wealthy man, or a well-informed researcher, you shall feel that you are but a few grains of sand all the same.|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/The Mausoleum of King Deshret|The Mausoleum of King Deshret]]}}
{{Description|There are neither coveted treasures nor gem-laden chambers at the pinnacle of the Mausoleum of King Deshret — only the desolation and decay of the desert, and the shreds of a grand dream.|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/Aaru's Shut|Aaru's Shut]]}}
