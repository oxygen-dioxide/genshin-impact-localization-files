|text    = It is said that [[dragon|a mighty ancient race]] once gained the knowledge they needed by submerging themselves in [[Phlogiston]]-rich flaming pools. It is also said that a weak and feeble race once attempted to do the same, only to be met by failure. Ultimately, it was [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan|a once benevolent sage]] who gave them the means to endure the knowledge they sought.
