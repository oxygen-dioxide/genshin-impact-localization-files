{{Quote|Always energetic and full of life, Amber's the best &mdash; albeit only &mdash; Outrider of the Knights of Favonius.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Outrider for the Knights of Favonius, Amber is described as "a model for justice" by [[Kaeya]]. She fulfills her duties as an Outrider diligently, even though she's the only one left in the said platoon. She abides by the rules, except for when using her wind glider, having her gliding license revoked numerous times.

She has an outgoing personality, as one might find her talking to strangers as if they're acquaintances. She is passionate in everything she does, may it be helping the citizens or purging hilichurls. She wishes to be as great as her grandfather, a once loyal defender of [[Mondstadt]]. Even after he disappeared, she still defends Mondstadt in his place.

In an age where Outriders are becoming obsolete, she continues on with her responsibilities.</p><p>It takes a newcomer only a few days to feel right at home with this passionate girl.</p><p>Whether it's before the [[Good Hunter]]'s signboard, the banks of [[Cider Lake]], or the tree tops at [[Windrise]], one can find traces of this vigilant Outrider in red anywhere. </p><p>Once spotted by her, no suspicious individual can ever escape her interrogation.</p>

|text2         = <p>From a young age, Amber has always had boundless energy and a positive outlook on life.</p><p>Each day, she burns with a fiery enthusiasm that sees her go about her life like a whirlwind, smashing through any obstacle that stands in her way.</p><p>At times, however, her excessive energy can make her quite the troublemaker.</p><p>Needless to say, she was quite a handful when she was young. Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on her [[Amber's Grandfather|grandpa]]'s head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a [[Dendro Slime]]'s leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.</p><p>Somehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.</p><p>To Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.</p><p>But it was only on the day that her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years.</p>

|text3         = <p>Amber's grandpa was once the leader of a mercenary group. He came from [[Liyue Harbor]] and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed [[Teyvat]]. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack; he was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.</p><p>Too ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.</p><p>Before long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each one of them personally, and began leading them on missions.</p><p>It also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of [[Mondstadt]] and founded a family.</p><p>Years later, Amber was born into that family. During the day, she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the outriders; at night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.</p><p>Amber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew.</p><p>"When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then, I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?"</p><p>As the coarse skin of her grandpa's palm rubbed against her head, a bewildered but earnest Amber nodded energetically in response.</p>

In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.</p><p>On top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.</p><p>Amber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.</p><p>She had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage &mdash; and lots of it.</p><p>She wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.</p><p>But more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland.</p>

Whatever feedback she met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence, or taunting, her response was always the same.</p><p>"For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!"</p><p>Amber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.</p><p>She firmly believes that she will not disappoint her grandpa.</p>

That magical bird was a really cunning one, burrowing in the thick forest like that. Good thing I didn't give up! Best of all, Master Jean gave me special permission to pluck a feather plume from it as my reward. Hehe, I'll wear it at my side every single day!"</p><p>"I'm sure I followed the cookbook to the letter and grilled the meat for six minutes.

It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world."</p><p>Amber realized that she shouldn't wait for directions from someone else, but that she should be like those courageous birds that spread their wings and flew into the blue skies.</p><p>"There must be something that only I can do.

===Manga===
Amber is a major character in the [[manga]], which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.

Amber befriends [[Collei]] after the latter's arrival in Mondstadt. Amber does her best to help Collei with her search while also investigating the Black Fire Incident, during which Amber discovers the metal birds planted by the Fatui and disables them before they can cause any harm. Amber also takes Collei to [[Ludi Harpastum]] festivities and shows Collei that people lead happy lives in Mondstadt.

Amber resolves to help Collei after she discovers that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident but does not want to use her powers. Amber stands guard while [[Cyno]] seals away Collei's archon residue.<ref group="Note">Due to localization adjustments made after the manga's release, this term is no longer accurate. The original Chinese term refers to gods predating the rise of [[The Seven]].</ref> Afterward, Amber faces [[Barnabas]] alone to protect Collei and eventually brings him down with [[Diluc]]'s help.

There is also a flashback in the manga that shows Amber was present when Diluc resigned from the Knights of Favonius, as she was hiding in a cupboard to surprise [[Amber's Grandfather|her grandfather]].

==Trivia==
* Amber is closely affiliated with rabbits: her ribbon looks like perked bunny ears, her taunting doll is named Baron Bunny and her constellation is a hare. The [[manga]] reinforces this theme as well.
* Amber's grandfather hails from [[Liyue]], making Amber at least quarter Liyue-descent.
** In the [[Qingce Village Bulletin Board#I|Qingce Village Bulletin Board]], one message talks about a person who went to Mondstadt to become a knight some 40 or 50 years ago, only to return to the village, where he can be found "skulking around." The message also remarks that the man is distinguishable by the way he rides a Wind Glider. This person might be Amber's grandfather after his disappearance.
** It is possible that her grandfather is also the adventurer whom [[Granny Ruoxin]] fell in love with, who promised to settle down with her in Qingce Village but never returned from his expedition.
** The [[Favonius Warbow]]'s description talks about Amber's grandfather, and the last sentence in its description is referring to Amber.
*Amber is seen wielding the [[Hunter's Bow]] in her splash art and the [[Favonius Warbow]] during [[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]].
