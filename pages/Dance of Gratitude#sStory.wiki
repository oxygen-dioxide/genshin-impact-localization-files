:'''Paimon:''' Wow, Nilou's dance was so beautiful!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to watch more! When is Nilou's next performance? Let's check the theater's bulletin board~

;(Check the bulletin board)
:'''Paimon:''' Let's see... huh? There are so many messages from the audience here, and many of them are for Nilou!
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't we collect them and pass them to Nilou? She must be curious to know what everyone thinks about the show!
::Your swirling skirt on stage reminds me of the Windwheel Asters that grow in Mondstadt.<br />I came to Zubayr Theater because I wanted to present with you this bouquet of Windwheel Asters.<br />May your dance always be as light as the petals.

::Nilou's dance is always so magical, haha.<br />Forgive me for nagging, but don't forget to eat, even if you're busy with rehearsals.<br />You young people always indulge in your hobbies and end up neglecting your health.<br />I made you some Shawarma Wraps, don't forget to eat them after the show.

::The lights of the Zubayr Theater are like spots of starlight, shining on Nilou as she danced. It was really mesmerizing! When will I be able to become such an outstanding person?<br />I heard that you like sweets, so I prepared an Inazuman specialty, I hope you like it!

::I heard from a friend that there's a lady from the Zubayr Theater in Sumeru who dances like a fairy. Today, I got to admire her dance, and it was absolutely extraordinary!<br />This is a Liyue specialty that I made. The shrimp is sweet and has a bite to it. Most importantly, this dish is extremely low in calories, and is thus very popular with actors and actresses who need to maintain their figure.<br />If you don't mind, you can try it with the rest of the crew.

:'''Paimon:''' Nilou! We were just looking at your schedule for the next show! Your dance just now was so beautiful! Paimon wants to see it again!
:'''Nilou:''' Really? I would love to hear your opinion... Ooh, right, I have to prepare the props for the next performance first...
:'''Nilou:''' Oh dear, I'm so sorry that I'm in such a hurry. I'll catch up with you guys as soon as I'm done getting ready!
:'''Paimon:''' And she's gone in a flash. Let's look around then.
:'''Paimon:''' Are these gifts from those who left the comments? Let's organize them!

;(After organizing the gifts)
:'''Paimon:''' Whew, that's all sorted now. Oh! Nilou is done!
:'''Paimon:''' Nilou, here!
:'''Nilou:''' What are you holding? All these gifts and messages... Are they from the audience?
:'''Nilou:''' I'm very thankful for everyone's kind words. These flowers and food are signs of everyone's encouragement and support. I will work harder and present my best performance on stage!
:'''Nilou:''' Traveler, Paimon, thank you! Here are the tickets for the next performance, don't forget to stop by!
