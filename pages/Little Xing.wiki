==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Little Xing:''' Do you know what the most important thing is to have if you wanna be an adventurer?

:{{DIcon}} Let me guess...
::'''Little Xing:''' Alright! What's your guess?
::{{DIcon}} Courage.
:::'''Little Xing:''' Yep! It's courage. Adventurers never know what they're gonna find, so they need courage to face it.
:::'''Little Xing:''' Like, I've never left the village on my own before, but I'm a big boy so I'm... I'm not scared.
:::'''Little Xing:''' It's the first step I need to take if I wanna become a mighty adventurer one day.
::{{DIcon}} [[Vision]].
:::'''Little Xing:''' That's what Little Liu says. You definitely need a [[Vision]].
:::'''Little Xing:''' With a Vision, you can do literally anything! Not just defeating all the monsters; you can get loadsa money too...
:::'''Little Xing:''' If I had loadsa money mom and dad wouldn't need to work away from home. They could stay in the village and it would be fun here like it used to be &mdash; like how Little Liu says it was!
::{{DIcon}} [[Paimon]].
:::'''Little Xing:''' Paimon? What's a Paimon? No one's told me about them before.
:::'''Little Xing:''' I'm asking an honest question here, buddy, and I'd appreciate an honest answer, too.
:::'''Little Xing:''' Hmm... Is it some kind of food?
:::'''Little Xing:''' That would make sense; you can't let your tummy rumble when you're on an adventure.
:{{DIcon}} Who knows.
::'''Little Xing:''' Huh. Okay then. Seems like Little Liu is the only one who's clued up on things around here...
