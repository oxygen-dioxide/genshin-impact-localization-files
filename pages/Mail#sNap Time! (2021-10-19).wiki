|text    = Every year, on this day, the [[Kano Nana|shrine maiden]] would give me a carrot cake, wish me a happy birthday, and let me have the day off from training. So, I would sleep all day like a log. I live for those moments.

Hmm... but this year I met you, and you mean a lot to me. After some thinking, I decided that today, I'll only sleep for half the day! For the other half, we could grab a meal together...

What should we eat? How about an [[Unagi Meat]] dish? The [[Unagi]] often stretch their necks and stick their heads as high as they can, so eating them should be good for growing tall! I've prepared a lot of them, so I hope you like them! Hmm... I'm starting to feel a little sleepy now... I'm going to find a comfortable tree for a little nap while you get ready. Don't forget to wake me up.

Zzz...
