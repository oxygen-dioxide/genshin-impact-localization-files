{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Electricity
|desc_1 = When electricity is present on an Electro Slime (indicated when its "antenna" is glowing), it will be inflicted with {{Electro}} at all times, and its attacks will deal {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* An Electro Slime starts with and can possess a maximum of 4 gauges of electricity.
* Triggering [[Elemental Reactions]] on an Electro Slime will consume gauges of electricity. Every 1 [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge]] of {{Cryo}}/{{Pyro}}/{{Dendro}}, or 2 gauges of {{Geo}}/{{Anemo}} applied to the Electro Slime will consume 1 gauge of electricity.
* Additionally, every time the slime takes {{Color|Electro DMG}}, it will gain full electricity, regardless of the amount of Electro gauges applied. Therefore, due to the [[Swirl]] and [[Electro-Charged]] reaction's ability to deal {{Color|Electro DMG}}, {{Anemo}} or {{Hydro}} on their own will never be able to deplete the Electro Slime's electricity.
* '''Shock:''' Periodically consumes 1 gauge of '''electricity''' and releases a shockwave, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} around itself. This attack deals DMG to both enemies and allies.
* '''Recharge:''' After a period of time has passed since '''electricity''' ran out, recharges to once again gain 4 gauges of '''electricity'''.

|desc_2 = Bumps into the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as  {{Color|Electro DMG}} if '''electricity''' is present or {{Color|Physical DMG}} if '''electricity''' is not present.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A small monster created by the coalescing of Electro dispersed throughout nature.<br />According to analyses, the jumping of Electro [[Slimes]] reflects the electric potential difference in the ground. In areas brimming over with Electro, their unusual movements can be observed and used to avoid danger.|[[Archive]]}}
