'''''The Measure of a Mushroom''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] in [[Sumeru]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|Some strange mushrooms that possess impressive elasticity have appeared in the wild...}}
# Complete the Jumping Challenge (0/1)
#* Jump on the "Bouncy Mushrooms": 0/5 times

==Gameplay Notes==
* Bounce on the mushrooms consecutively to complete the challenge. Touching the ground or landing on a mushroom without bouncing resets the challenge counter to 0, which may occur if the [[Wind Glider]] is open while landing, or if the character is not sufficiently high when Wind Glider is closed.
** If the character dies from [[Fall Damage]] when bouncing on the mushroom, the bounce will not count towards the challenge completion.
** If the player's ping is high or their internet connection is unstable, the removal of old mushrooms and the generation of new mushrooms may not occur in a timely manner. Because of this, the exact same mushroom may be bounced on multiple times. However, only one bounce will count.
* Using [[Talent]]s that are usable in mid-air such as {{Talent|Chihayaburu|nobr=1}} and {{Talent|Lemniscatic Wind Cycling|nobr=1}} will reset the challenge counter to 0.
* The locations of the Bouncy Mushrooms change upon each bounce, but cycle through certain dispositions depending on the location.
