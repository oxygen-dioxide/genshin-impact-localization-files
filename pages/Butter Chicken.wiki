'''Butter Chicken''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The recipe is obtainable from [[Effendi]] for reaching Reputation Level 1 in [[Sumeru]].

Depending on the quality, Butter Chicken will increase the party's attack by '''160'''/'''194'''/'''228''' for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].

When [[Dori]] cooks Butter Chicken, there is a chance [[Show Me the Mora]] will be created instead.
