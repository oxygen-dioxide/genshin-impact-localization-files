'''Bulle Fruit''' is a [[food]] item that the player obtains by foraging in the wild.

Bulle Fruit restores 300 HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]]; this can only target characters of the player's party.

==How to Obtain==
Bulle Fruits grow in groups of three on some [[Cuihua Wood|Cuihua Trees]] in [[Fontaine]], and can be harvested by either climbing or hitting the tree to make them fall within the player's reach. Dropped Bulle Fruits may also be found at the base of such trees.

==Description==
{{Description|A fruit that grows in warm and damp environments with ample sunlight. Inside this round and rotund fruit hides a sweet and refreshing surprise.<br>They say that in times of old, there was once a protracted debate among Fontainian philosophers on whether Bulle Fruit was closer to sunrise or sunset in color and whether it should be called "Sunriseia" or "Sunsettia." This heated debate was eventually brought to an end when these philosophers discovered that [[Sunsettia]] already existed. They unwillingly compromised and agreed to name the sweet fruit for its shape instead.}}

==Trivia==
* The delicious version of ''Bulle Sauce Duck Breast'' describes its flavour as "tangerine", just like its appearance.

===Etymology===
