'''Slowing Water''' is a [[Ley Line Disorder]] and [[Aura]] that increases the [[Cooldown]] of skills and bursts while active.

It can be removed via [[Elemental Reactions]]. If applied as a domain debuff, the player can also reduce the time affected by the debuff by using an artifact from [[Prayers for Destiny]] or the {{color|Electro|High Voltage}} [[Elemental Resonance]]. However, the duration-shortening methods do not work if the debuff is applied by an enemy.
