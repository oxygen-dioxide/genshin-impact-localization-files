'''Primal Torches''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Great Red Sand]], [[Sumeru]] found in the Ruins of King Deshret.

They can be activated by leading a [[Primal Ember]] towards them.

Once activated, they trigger various effects such as opening doors, turning on or off various constructs of the ruins of King Deshret, increasing the [[Scarlet Sand Slate]]'s clearance or spawning [[chest]]s.

Most often, multiple nearby Primal Torches must be activated to trigger their effect ; some may already be activated.
