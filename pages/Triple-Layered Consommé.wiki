|desc_basic      = The ham, fowl, and bamboo shoots have been sliced into threads of equal length, and they've been laid out neatly in the soup bowl after being steamed at high heat, before being covered in consommé. The layers are distinct, and the mouthfeel is salty yet fresh.
|desc_delicious  = The evenly-sized threads reveal exquisite knife-work. Rather than a dish, this seems more like a work of art. But once you work up the wherewithal to pick up those chopsticks and have at it, the delicious flavors will be utter bliss &mdash; leaving this as a mere work of art would be such a shame.

==Trivia==
* The dish is directly based on a traditional {{w|Shanghai cuisine|Shanghai dish}} called {{Lang|mini=1|zh=扣三丝|zh_rm=Kòusānsī|zh_tl=Inverted Three Threads}}, which is also the name of the item in Chinese.
** This dish is traditionally made from {{w|Jinhua ham}}, winter bamboo shoot, and chicken breast meat. These ingredients are each cut into extremely fine threads, arranged neatly in a small bowl with a shiitake mushroom, and steamed with chicken stock. The small bowl is inverted into a soup plate and chicken stock is ladled on top.
