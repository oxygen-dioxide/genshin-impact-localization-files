{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Kumi)
:'''???:''' ...Ah, hello.
:'''???:''' Sorry, I got a little distracted...
:'''???:''' You guys are... unfamiliar faces. Sorry...I'm not very good at talking to strangers.
:'''???:''' Ah... sorry... I didn't mean to be rude, I'm just... Sorry...
:{{DIcon}} Just call me (Traveler).
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's name is Paimon, nice to meet you!
:'''Kumi:''' ...I'm Kumi, nice to meet you.
:'''Kumi:''' Sorry, I just... rarely chat with people.
:'''Kumi:''' May I ask... Is there anything I can help you with?
:{{DIcon}} About this carcass...
:'''Paimon:''' We were just wondering, what animal carcass is this...?
:'''Kumi:''' Oh...
:'''Kumi:''' Her name is [[Kuntira]], she's sort of... my childhood friend.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh...?
:{{DIcon}} Good...friend?
:'''Kumi:''' This might sound silly... You may even think it's just my wishful thinking...
:'''Kumi:''' This skeleton is what my childhood friend left behind.
:{{DIcon}} Oh...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh...
:'''Paimon:''' Your friend was able to defeat such a huge sea creature... That's amazing!
:{{DIcon}} *coughing*
:{{DIcon}} (That's not what she meant...)
:'''Kumi:''' Ahem...
:'''Kumi:''' I mean, these are bones of my childhood friend. She's a sea creature.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh...
:'''Kumi:''' On [[Narukami Island]] &mdash; my father's hometown, people call these creatures "[[Umibouzu]]"...
:'''Kumi:''' It is also said that they often attack cargo ships on long voyages and will rob fishermen of their catch... So they are hunted down and killed by humans.
:'''Kumi:''' But over here &mdash; my mother's hometown &mdash; the locals would give each individual creature a unique name.
:'''Kumi:''' And she, my best friend... may have been the last of her kind.
:{{DIcon}} Is that right...
:'''Paimon:''' Wow...
:'''Kumi:''' The people of [[Watatsumi Island|Watatsumi]] never gave her species a common name.
:'''Kumi:''' Because they think that... Just like us, each of them is a lonely individual.
:'''Kumi:''' Lonely, docile, indifferent to curiosity and hostility outside of their own world...
:'''Kumi:''' Alone, roaming in the currents. Alone, suffocating in the shallows.
:{{DIcon}} Huh...
:'''Paimon:''' How pitiful...
:'''Kumi:''' Don't think of it that way.
:'''Kumi:''' Intentionally or not, when you say words like "how pitiful," you're alienating yourself from the other person and their experience. It dismisses and trivializes their pain.
:'''Kumi:''' Only by empathizing with the other party's loneliness and pain, letting go of fear and defense, can we truly achieve understanding...
:'''Kumi:''' Perhaps that was why we happened to become friends back then.
:'''Kumi:''' Rather than alleviating each other's loneliness, we were enjoying the loneliness together, a solitude we both shared.
:'''Kumi:''' Its just  that I have been away for a long time since I grew up. I finally had the opportunity to come back, only to realize that it's too late...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry to hear that.
:'''Kumi:''' It's okay, don't let me affect your mood.
:'''Kumi:''' Ah... excuse me, can you... Umm, never mind, it's nothing.
:'''Paimon:''' It's okay, just let us know!
:{{DIcon}} Do you need our help?
:'''Kumi:''' ...Yes, sorry to bother the both of you.
:'''Kumi:''' I cam from Narukami Island wanting to visit her and stay here for a while...
:'''Kumi:''' But as you can see, my best friend has passed away. The way home is also blocked by war... Maybe I'll be stranded even longer.
:'''Kumi:''' I wanted to...at least offer something to my best friend. She loves [[Thunder Sakura]] flowers.
:'''Kumi:''' But for safety reasons...I can no longer go back to the place where the Thunder Sakura grows.
:'''Kumi:''' If I could ask you guys for help... I'd be ever so grateful.
:{{DIcon}} We'll do our best.
:{{DIcon}} I'll bear that in mind.
:'''Kumi:''' Thank you very much, umm... Be careful when passing through the non-safe areas. I will pray for you here.
:'''Paimon:''' Miss Kumi, you're too polite!
----
;(Talk to Kumi)
:'''Kumi:''' ...
:'''Kumi:''' ...Ah, sorry, I didn't expect you guys to be back so soon.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I brought what you asked for.
:;(Opens submission screen)
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing, we're still trying to look for the petals.
::'''Kumi:''' Thank you for your hard work, it's good to take a break here.
----
{{Quest Description|Update|After collecting the Sakura Bloom, give it to Kumi and see if she is troubled by anything else}}
;(After submitting the [[Sakura Bloom]]s)
:'''Kumi:''' Thank you so much! I knew I could count on you guys!
:'''Kumi:''' ...Mm, there are enough to make a wreath of flowers, thank you once again.
:'''Kumi:''' By the way... I have one more thing I want to ask of you, I don't know if you guys mind...
:'''Paimon:''' Since we've already helped you out, feel free to tell us, Miss Kumi!
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:{{DIcon}} Do you need help?
:'''Kumi:''' ...It's like this. I heard from the elders of [[Bourou Village]] that there is hilichurl activity again on the beach to the west.
:'''Kumi:''' It so happens that a researcher from [[Sumeru]] passed by here the other day and is heading there... I think her name is [[Anisa]], and she hasn't returned yet.
:'''Kumi:''' I'm quite worried about her...
:'''Paimon:''' That researcher... Is she your friend?
:'''Kumi:''' Are friends the only ones worth worrying about?
:'''Kumi:''' Sorry, I mean... I don't really know her well, but I'm just worried.
:{{DIcon}} I understand.
:{{DIcon}} I'll help find her.
:'''Kumi:''' Sorry to trouble you again... If it weren't for the fact that I can't handle myself in fights...
:'''Paimon:''' It's okay, you don't have to blame yourself! Let's just go help!
;(Talk to Kumi again)
:'''Kumi:''' Can I help you with anything?
:{{DIcon}} About Anisa...
:'''Kumi:''' She's a researcher from Sumeru. She's rather reckless, but she has a beautiful voice...
:'''Kumi:''' She said that her field of study was Oceanic Sanctuary Storage... something. I'm not sure what that's about, really.
:'''Kumi:''' But she seems to be very interested in that Watatsumi statue on the beach to the west...
:{{DIcon}} Watatsumi statue?
:'''Kumi:''' Mm-hmm. The village elder used to say that if we could solve the shrine maiden's puzzle, then "our heart's desire" would emerge.
:'''Kumi:''' Hehe, I used to believe that. Everyday, I would swim near that statue... That was actually how I met my good friend as well.
:'''Kumi:''' But I grew out of that a long time ago. I no longer believe in those stories.
:'''Kumi:''' Still, I can't help but feel happy for Anisa &mdash; that she still has so much interest and passion regarding these old legends.
:'''Kumi:''' I hope that she finds what she seeks...
:'''Kumi:''' Well, but before that, please find out if she's alright. Thank you very much.
----
{{Quest Description|Update|Kumi would like you to go to the hilichurl camp in the west to check on Anisa's safety.}}
{{Quest Description|Update|As Expected, Anisa is in trouble!}}
;(Approach the camp)
:'''Anisa:''' Please, someone, save my thesis! If the hilichurls destroy it, I'm done for
:'''Paimon:''' Look! The researcher Kumi talked about is right over there!
{{Quest Description|Update|Can this bumbling, reckless person really be a researcher from Sumeru? Well, as long as she's alright...}}
;(Talk to Anisa after defeating the Hilichurls)
:'''Anisa:''' *panting* Phew... Thank you, if it weren't for your help, I'm afraid I would be dead...
:{{DIcon}} No need to thank us.
:'''Paimon:''' You're Anisa, right? Miss Kumi asked us to come!
:'''Anisa:''' Kumi...? Oh! It's that...local lass who looks a bit gloomy but is very nice, right?
:{{DIcon}} Lass...?
:'''Paimon:''' What a strange and flippant way to describe her
:'''Anisa:''' Hehe... Actually, I forgot her name. I really shouldn't have. I'll have to thank her properly later on.
:'''Anisa:''' Oh, yes, her name is "Kumi," right?
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! You shouldn't be a researcher with a memory like that!
:'''Anisa:''' Yes, I remember this time! Kumi, that's a cute name. Kumi...
:{{DIcon}} *coughing*
:'''Anisa:''' Ah, sorry, I didn't introduce myself, although you might already know...
:'''Anisa:''' I'm Anisa. Anisa Purbiruni. Trainee Dastur at [[Sumeru Akademiya]]'s Oceanographic Society.
:'''Anisa:''' As for my surname, Purbiruni, it's because my academic lineage dates back five centuries to the great scholar, the sage Biruni.
:'''Anisa:''' Ah, every time I mention this, a pride that cannot be expressed in words wells up within me unbidden!
:'''Paimon:''' Man, she's like some rich girl bragging about her dad's money...
:{{DIcon}} Kumi's very worried about you.
:'''Anisa:''' Hehe...
:'''Paimon:''' What are you laughing about?
:'''Anisa:''' Nothing... I'm just a little embarrassed about making people worry about me...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's surprised that you can be embarrassed at all!
:'''Anisa:''' However, there are still things that I have yet to do. The research I have on hand has not yet borne fruit, and so I must hurry.
:'''Anisa:''' You know, the statues of Watatsumi here are the object of my research. The traditional beliefs of the people of Watatsumi are very fascinating.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Anisa:''' In antiquity, the priests... uh, I mean, shrine maidens of Watatsumi would place permanently-given offerings under memorials.
:'''Anisa:''' After that, they would protect those offerings with sophisticated mechanical puzzles or simple elemental techniques.
:'''Paimon:''' What?
:'''Anisa:''' This was originally a manner of protecting and storing objects that were offered...
:'''Anisa:''' But people gradually discovered the joys of solving puzzles for their own sake, and even considered this a way of communication with the now-deceased through one's intellect.
:'''Anisa:''' As such, the solving of puzzles became melded together with religious rituals, resulting a most unique tradition.
:'''Anisa:''' As such, apart from the usual offerings, "solving puzzles left by those who came before" and seeking the "desires of the heart" also became rituals of worship or divination.
:'''Anisa:''' Of course, the better part of this is my personal guesswork. If we want to be sure, we'll need to conduct a great deal of folklore studies.
:{{DIcon}} So, these "desires of the heart" are actually...
:'''Anisa:''' It's as you guessed. I'm referring to the riches offered to the statues of Watatsumi &mdash; the gifts of forebears to their descendants.
:'''Paimon:''' Riches!
:'''Anisa:''' By which I mean treasure, of course &mdash; treasure!
:'''Paimon:''' Treasure!
:'''Anisa:''' Your little companion seems to have a strong interest in my topic of study. How about it, then. Interested in lending me a hand?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} What happened to my Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' Come on, there's treasure! Let's just help out, shall we?
:'''Anisa:''' As for me, I'm not all that interested in treasure. I just need my research results.
:'''Anisa:''' It'll be great if you're willing to help. The treasure's all yours. Consider it your payment for helping me out!
:'''Paimon:''' Woohoo!
:'''Anisa:''' Woohoo!
:{{DIcon}} Please stop ignoring me!
:{{DIcon}} I'll consider it.
:'''Anisa:''' Oh, don't worry. Let's start right here!
{{Quest Description|Update|Enigmas and wisdom are contained within memories... and memories are always fresh.}}

;(Talk to Anisa before completing the puzzle)
:'''Anisa:''' It's fine if you can't solve it for now. The puzzle isn't going to run away or anything!
:'''Anisa:''' I'll be here too &mdash; so just relax.

;(Talk to Kumi before completing the puzzle)
:'''Kumi:''' Ah, it's you. Is there anything else I can help you with?
:{{DIcon}} We found Anisa.
:'''Kumi:''' Oh, thank you. How is she?
:{{DIcon}} She's in one piece and then some.
:{{DIcon}} She's just busy with her research topic.
:'''Kumi:''' Mmm, as long as she's alright... She can be really reckless, and it's very worrying.
:'''Kumi:''' I know that we're still practically strangers, but I wouldn't want to see anyone get hurt needlessly, especially at times like these...
:'''Kumi:''' Also, she... Never mind...

;(When the player fails puzzle for the first time)
:'''Anisa:''' Looks like we didn't follow the right steps. Let me write this down... Do you think we'll find some clues at the {{Color|buzzword|big shed}} over there?

;(Upon activating the three Elemental Monuments)
:'''Anisa:''' We've activated it. Let's proceed!

;(When the player fails the puzzle after activating the Elemental Monuments)
:'''Anisa:''' That doesn't seem quite right, but oh well. Just give it a few more tries!

;(Upon completing the puzzle)
:'''Anisa:''' Look, we did it!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, treasure! Nice!

;(Talk to Anisa after completing the puzzle)
:'''Anisa:''' Well then, congratulations are in order!
:{{DIcon}} These are offerings, you know...
:{{DIcon}} Can we really take them?
:'''Anisa:''' Haha, it's fine. It's like I said, this is a symbol of "the heart's desire."
:'''Anisa:''' The forebears of this land left it to those who came after, as a symbol of faith and a token of trust. In fact, hmm, you could consider it a concrete way of "passing memories on."
:'''Anisa:''' So be at ease and just take it. It's yours by right.
:'''Anisa:''' The people of Watatsumi understood this very early on: the fruits of wisdom are to be given to those who respect it.
:'''Anisa:''' ...Just like you and me!
:'''Paimon:''' Does Paimon count too?
:'''Anisa:''' Of course! Thanks for your hard work!
:{{DIcon}} You're most welcome.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, no need to be so formal!
:'''Anisa:''' *sigh* Still, this thesis I'm working on is such a headache.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Didn't you have a breakthrough already?
:'''Anisa:''' Well, yes. But I've spent far too much time on just one subject.
:'''Anisa:''' To formally become a [[Dastur]] as opposed to remaining a trainee, you need to have two different theses pass through the review stage...
:'''Anisa:''' I can ask for an extension, of course, but I do still need to find a second topic.
:'''Anisa:''' My second field of study is actually in marine biology, but due to the recent instability in Inazuma, I've had to call a halt to research on that front.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, marine biology, you say...
:{{DIcon}} I just thought of something...
:'''Anisa:''' Eh? What is it?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh right! Miss Kumi's good friend!
:'''Anisa:''' Huh? Haha, I don't think she and I have gotten that far yet...
:'''Paimon:''' ...?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's talking about a sea creature.
:'''Anisa:''' Eh!? Oh... Oh right! I remember now!
:'''Paimon:''' What does this person fill their brain with, Paimon wonders...
:'''Anisa:''' I actually had a passing glance at that creature earlier. If I'm not mistaken, the skeleton is that of an Umibouzu &mdash; or at least, that's what the people of Narukami Island call it.
:'''Anisa:''' They are huge, intelligent and savage sea monsters, and were once considered the arch-nemesis of all sailors.
:'''Anisa:''' They were overly clever and overly proud... Just like us humans. I suppose that's why they came into conflict with us and became savage beasts.
:'''Anisa:''' These sea creatures have been all but wiped out in most ocean regions, but it seems that this isn't the case here...
:'''Anisa:''' It seems as though they've even grown close to humanity. This is a very unusual phenomenon indeed. Very interesting.
:'''Anisa:''' Thanks a lot! I knew I was right to call on you two for help.
:'''Anisa:''' Well, time's a-wasting here. Let's head back and look for Miss Kumi!
:'''Paimon:''' Yep, let's go!
{{Quest Description|Update|...Is this a sad reminiscence, or the beginning of a new life?}}
----
;(Upon returning to Kumi)
:'''Kumi:''' Hello there. Thanks for bringing Anisa back safe and sound
:{{DIcon}} You're welcome.
:{{DIcon}} I only did as I should've.
:'''Anisa:''' Hello there, Little... uh, Miss Kumi. Sorry for making you worry.
:'''Kumi:''' I'm just glad to see that you're all right. I've just finished my garland, too.
:'''Kumi:''' Sorry for taking up your time. Let me give her this garland...
:'''Anisa:''' Mm, please go ahead.
:'''Kumi:''' Thank you.
;(Kumi places the garland onto the bones)
:'''Kumi:''' I hope that my feelings, though late, will get through to her.
:'''Kumi:''' I'm... all alone again...
:'''Anisa:''' What was her name?
:'''Kumi:''' ...?
:'''Paimon:''' Eh, why are you suddenly asking that?
:{{DIcon}} (Shh...)
:'''Anisa:''' I hear that the people of Watatsumi give each individual a unique name.
:'''Anisa:''' If you don't mind me asking, what was your friend's name?
:'''Kumi:''' Kuntira.
:'''Anisa:''' That's a lovely name.
:'''Kumi:''' Thank you...
:'''Kumi:''' The elders on the island say that "kuntira" means "whale" in the ancient language.
:'''Kumi:''' But I chose this name because I like it...
:'''Anisa:''' Well, it also fits with "Kumi," doesn't it? It's a lovely name!
:'''Paimon:''' (What's she doing!?)
:{{DIcon}} (Best we avoid disturbing them, Paimon.)
:'''Kumi:''' Um, thank you.
:'''Anisa:''' *cough* Apologies. I spoke a little out of turn.
:'''Kumi:''' That's okay.
:'''Kumi:''' She was the last remnant of their kind. She was born alone, and she died alone.
:'''Kumi:''' Born in the sea, dying on land where she didn't belong, suffocating in the air...
:'''Kumi:''' Recently I've been thinking, sooner or later, this might be my destiny as well.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh...?
:{{DIcon}} (......)
:'''Anisa:''' ...
:'''Anisa:''' It's not like that.
:'''Kumi:''' There's no need to persuade me... I understand what you're thinking... but after all, you and I are not the same...
:'''Kumi:''' I wasn't born here, nor do I belong to my father's hometown...
:'''Anisa:''' No, I was talking about the pelvic bones.
:'''Kumi:''' ...?
:'''Anisa:''' Yes, the pelvic bones.
:{{DIcon}} Pelvic bones...?
:'''Paimon:''' Pelvic bones? What are you talking about?
:'''Anisa:''' *cough* It's like this...
:'''Anisa:''' Have you guys noticed, that unlike a whale, she still has well-developed pelvic bones{{sic|.?}}
:'''Paimon:''' Not at all... How did you notice?
:'''Anisa:''' Since I first arrived here, I have been paying attention to its pelvic structure... and the traces it left behind. I suppose you can call this an academic's instinct, hehe.
:'''Anisa:''' Hmmm...for example, when we give birth, we experience strong expansions and contractions, and as such, a stable support structure that protects out internal organs and soft tissues is indispensable.
:'''Anisa:''' Our pelvis is the structure that performs this function, and for Kuntira, her pelvis is the same.
:'''Kumi:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Well...
:{{DIcon}} Oh...
:'''Anisa:''' A pelvis that has undergone childbirth tends to show a certain degree of deformation and wear due to expansion and contraction.
:'''Anisa:''' The body shape of primitive marine creatures tends to be teardrop-shaped, so their pelvises are also narrower.
:'''Anisa:''' In other words, the marks of pelvic deformation are more obvious and easier to observe.
:'''Kumi:''' Hmmm...is that so?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh...
:{{DIcon}} Oh...
:'''Anisa:''' Ah, sorry, I've just been talking about common knowledge. I suppose I've been boring you all to death.
:'''Kumi:''' Oh no, please continue...
:'''Kumi:''' You have a very beautiful tone of voice, at least. Has anyone ever told you that?
:'''Anisa:''' Uhm... Thank you... I never noticed... *cough* *cough* Um, thanks.
:'''Anisa:''' Ahem... Back to the topic at hand... As such, I have grounds to fully refute your reasoning.
:'''Anisa:''' Based on the deformations of the pelvic bones, she must have undergone many births. It seems she had found her home in the sea, and...
:'''Kumi:''' She had more than one offspring...
:'''Paimon:''' Wow...
:'''Anisa:''' Hmmm, in other words, she found her own happiness.
:'''Kumi:''' But if that's the case...then why would she...
:{{DIcon}} Stay stranded here...?
:'''Kumi:''' ...
:'''Anisa:''' Haha, that's your second mistake, Miss Kumi.
:'''Anisa:''' Stranded sea animals often show signs of distortion and strain on certain parts of their vertebrae.
:'''Anisa:''' If you must know why, it's because suffocating is... very painful.
:'''Kumi:''' ...
:'''Anisa:''' But based on my preliminary observations, Kuntira's spine is straight, almost as if she did not experience any painful struggle...
:'''Anisa:''' Based on a rough observation of her bone age, I would estimate that she passed away safely before she came to shore...
:'''Anisa:''' As for why she came to this familiar place in her final hours...
:'''Anisa:''' Maybe this was her way of telling her good friend that she had lived a happy and fulfilling life.
:'''Kumi:''' ...
:'''Kumi:''' Thank you.
:'''Anisa:''' So, you've got to live well, too.
:'''Kumi:''' ...?
:'''Kumi:''' Yes... I will.
:'''Kumi:''' ...You know, I would always feel torn as to whether I should return to my home on Narukami Island or to stay here in Bourou Village...
:'''Anisa:''' Before, I was also torn whether to head back to Akademiya or stay in this country.
:'''Anisa:''' Due to the war, confusion, the pressure from the Shogunate...it's all too much, and many people have considered giving up.
:'''Anisa:''' But one must make a choice, to continue or to give up. Choosing to continue may still wind up being fruitless, but choosing to give up...
:'''Kumi:''' I won't give up.
:'''Kumi:''' When it's war or government, they're just another problem. This is another matter entirely...
:'''Anisa:''' Haha, you're right!
:'''Anisa:''' Think about it, hundreds of years later when people talk about this war, they can only lament the tragedy it caused and how meaningless it all was.
:'''Anisa:''' But when they talk about the history of Watatsumi Island, about your friends, and you and me, they will remember...
:'''Kumi:''' That this island had a daredevil that stumbled out and somehow unlocked some of the truths behind our history?
:'''Anisa:''' Yes, and that there also lived a girl who befriended a giant sea creature, and thus decided where her home should be.
:'''Kumi:''' ...
:'''Kumi:''' When she was young, when she first met me, I had a similar feeling... the feeling that my life was only just beginning.
;(Anisa walks towards Kumi)
:'''Anisa:''' Then let your life begin once again &mdash; this time, without any fear of loss.
:'''Paimon:''' (Ohh, Paimon's getting mad! We were running all these errands for them, and here they are, chatting away!)
:{{DIcon}} (Relax, Paimon).
:{{DIcon}} *cough* *cough*
:'''Anisa:''' Uh, having said that, there is one thing that I must ask you, Miss Kumi.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... You're so formal all of a sudden!
:{{DIcon}} She's got some other agenda, huh...
:'''Anisa:''' I might have to stay on Watatsumi Island to study marine life in the long term... So in the meantime, could I, uh...
:'''Kumi:''' Do you mean that you want to... study Kuntira's children?
:'''Anisa:''' No, I want to try making friends with her children.
:'''Anisa:''' And... if you don't mind, Miss Kumi&mdash; Well, it's at your convenience, of course, I wouldn't want to...
:'''Kumi:''' I live in Bourou Village. I'm sure I could give you a room, as long as you're alright with it.
:'''Kumi:''' I'd love to meet her children as well. Maybe that was what she wanted me to see &mdash; the family that she cared about.
:'''Anisa:''' Thank you!
:'''Kumi:''' And there's no need to learn how to speak as we do. I think you speak beautifully as it is.
:'''Anisa:''' Hehe... Well then, thanks a lot, Lit&mdash; I mean, Miss Kumi!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh.. It feels like we've been left out in the cold.
:{{DIcon}} Just a little.
:{{DIcon}} It is how it is, Paimon.
:'''Kumi:''' Thank you so much for {{sic|you}} help as well, (Traveler), Paimon. I will not forget this.
:'''Anisa:''' Hehe, me too! My future lectures will always have seats open for you!
;(Paimon throws a tantrum)
:'''Paimon:''' What? No, Paimon's not here to study!
