'''Melodic Blooms''' are exploration puzzles found in [[Golden Apple Archipelago/2.8|Golden Apple Archipelago]] during [[Summertime Odyssey]]. An activated [[Melodic Harp]] will release sound waves that will cause any Melodic Blooms within an AoE to fire notes. The notes fired off by a Melodic Bloom can be transferred to the next Melodic Bloom. The player can interact with Melodic Blooms to change their directions. Certain large Melodic Blooms will create a [[Wind Current]] when activated.
