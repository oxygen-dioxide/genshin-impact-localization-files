:'''Yohanan:''' Can't these [[Forest Rangers]] be a little clearer? Spores? Pollen? How do they expect anyone to understand what they're saying?

:::'''Yohanan:''' Haha, I won! I'm telling you, even some researchers can't win against me!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Yohanan:''' What? You only won because you were carried by the strength of your deck...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...
::'''Yohanan:''' I'm from [[the Eremites]].
::'''Yohanan:''' Uh... What else...
::'''Yohanan:''' By the way, do you need a bodyguard?
::{{DIcon}} No, I'm really strong.
::'''Yohanan:''' Whoa, talk about a braggart.
::'''Yohanan:''' Well, here's hoping you're strong enough to survive the rainforest.
::'''Yohanan:''' Otherwise, you'll end up like [[Rudaba|that researcher]] over there, who can't afford to hire anyone and just wanders around crowded places.
::'''Yohanan:''' *sigh* I've heard that many researchers frequent the rainforest to study it, so there are more opportunities to make Mora here. Why can't I find anyone who'll hire me?
::'''Yohanan:''' I really envy [[Dehya|"Flame-Mane."]] It's said that she's got a huge job in the city. I'll make her buy me some drinks when I get back to the city!

::'''Yohanan:''' Huh? Okay.
