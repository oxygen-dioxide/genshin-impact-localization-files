==Gameplay Notes==
* Maximum Energy capacity for a character is the energy cost of the character's burst, e.g., [[Dawn]] costs 40 energy, so [[Diluc]] has 40 Maximum Energy.

==Description==
This blade was once used by a mighty general of [[Watatsumi Island|Watatsumi]].<br />
It is said that he only knew as much of swordsmanship as the "Getsumouun" and "Yuushio" styles he taught himself,<br />
And yet by their grace was he never vanquished by any mortal in a duel or on the field of battle.

It is often said that snakes and fish are both cold-blooded. But cold-blooded creatures ever seek the promised land of warmth.<br />
To see his people's dreams fulfilled, [[Orobashi|Omikami]] challenged the gathering storm clouds to war.<br />
Amongst the people of Watatsumi bent upon conquest, a young man stood out from the rest.<br />
His fearless valor won him great love in Watatsumi, and they named him Touzannou.<br />
But after many years passed, his kingly name was forgotten, only to be replaced by the epithet by which his foes knew him:<br />
"[[Akuou]]," the wicked fangs and claws of the Great Serpent, the savage, demonic invader of [[Yashiori Island]]...

The slaughter had hardened the young man into a warrior. But to him,<br />
Only the wish he made before departing, a wish made upon the moon reflected in the waters beside the shrine, was eternal.

"One day, I shall set myself above Mt. Yougou, overlooking the palace of the Lord of Thunder."<br />
"I will have a joyful showdown against the legendary [[Sasayuri|Great Tengu of Yougou]] upon the roof of [[Tenshukaku]]."<br />
"...And then I'll bring that tengu's mask back to [[Ayame]] and [[Mouun]] as a souvenir!"

At last, the tides washed all their dreams away like towers in the sand.<br />
The tengu's mask, shining like a crimson star, was shattered like seashore gravel amidst the chaotic battle,<br />
Nor would the shrine maiden who shone like moonlight into the young man's soul ever return again,<br />
While the Akuou himself would face the [[Musou no Hitotachi|blinding ray of lightning]] alongside the Great Serpent.
