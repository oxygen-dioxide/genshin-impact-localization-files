|text      = I've never liked dreaming. No matter what I see, I can neither control it nor easily escape.

But recently... it's you that I keep seeing.

All my dreams with you are of idle strolls and outings. Each time I awake, I can't help but wonder if I deserve to have such "sweet dreams"...

Perhaps were I to see you in the waking world, I would find the answer?

If you are willing to meet me, just speak my name.
