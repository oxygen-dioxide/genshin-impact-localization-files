{{Main|Mondstadt General Goods Order Board}}
The order board is located beside the shop.

==Trivia==
* According to Blanche, despite its size, the shop is able to procure and ship a large variety of items due to it being supplied directly from a warehouse in Liyue. Suggesting that, like the wine industry, they may hold a monopoly on general goods and the lack of similar shops in the whole of [[Mondstadt]].
* Mondstadt General Goods is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Landscape Painting: Country Home]]."
