::'''Mats:''' I was doing business abroad previously, and I normally only come back during Weinlesefest. It's no surprise that we haven't met before.
::'''Mats:''' If it's meant to be, I'm sure we'll meet again elsewhere!
:{{DIcon}} How's business these days?
::'''Mats:''' Not bad at all!
::'''Mats:''' As you can see, Weinlesefest is swarming with guests! I can make as much in one day here as I normally would in four or five!

::'''Mats:''' This event has invigorated me. We didn't make money, but we had more fun than ever.
::'''Mats:''' I guess it's the satisfaction of doing a good deed.
:{{DIcon}} Let's work together next time!
