'''Monroe''' is an [[NPC]] in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. He can be found praying in front of the God Statue in front of the [[Favonius Cathedral]] alongside [[Susie]] and [[Grace]], with [[Sayid]] nearby to observe the prayer group.

He tells the Traveler that he has never missed a meeting, thinking it is better than being at home, doing nothing.
