{{Description|Name: Choo-Choo Cart<br>Note: A rail car that allows people to move around specific areas in the Mirage.

'''Choo-Choo Carts''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Veluriyam Mirage]] in the [[Secret Summer Paradise]] event.

They can be used to traverse the topography and can fire Jubilant Waves to destroy [[Bloatty Floatties]]. The track can be switched by pressing a button in time. The player can also exit the Choo-Choo Cart at any time, except during certain quests.

Challenges can be re-initiated by destroying the Bloatty Floatty at the beginning of the track.

==Tracks==
===Overgrown Valley South===
At the stop near the [[Teleport Waypoint]] in [[Overgrown Valley]], the player can switch between four different tracks in order to reach different locations. Their destinations are indicated by the sign nearby:
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''View Rail Lines:''' "{{Color|#80C0FF|Cerulean}} Flower" heading to the {{Color|#80C0FF|Hub Flower}} above.
:'''View Rail Lines:''' "{{Color|#FFCC33|Amber}} Flower" heading to the {{Color|#FFCC33|Torrential Twister}} in the southeast.
:'''View Rail Lines:''' "{{Color|#FFACFF|Violet}} Flower" heading to the {{Color|#FFACFF|desert}} in the southwest.
:'''View Rail Lines:''' "{{Color|#80FFD7|Aquamarine}} Flower" heading to the {{Color|#80FFD7|cave}} in the east.
{{Dialogue End}}

Only the Violet Flower completes a full loop; however, this loop cannot be ridden backwards. Interacting with the nearby flower will switch through the tracks in this order.

===Overgrown Valley North===
{{Main|Choo-Choo Cart Test}}
At the northern stop, the player can ride three tracks, controlled by the nearby Hydro Eidolons, which each have associated challenges:
* Meh, It's Okay Rail &mdash; The Choo-Choo Cart Curveball
* Kinda Dizzy Now Rail &mdash; The Choo-Choo Cart Crash
* Aaaah! Please Slow Down Rail &mdash; The Choo-Choo Cart's Career
