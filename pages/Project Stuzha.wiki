'''Project Stuzha''' is a project conducted by the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]. It is known to involve [[Arlecchino]], [[Tartaglia]], [[Pulcinella]], and [[Pantalone]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sea Breeze Rendezvous}}</ref>

Very little is currently known about Project Stuzha. Following the events of [[Fontaine]]'s [[Archon Quest]]s, Pantalone and Pulcinella decided to have Arlecchino and the [[House of the Hearth]] take the spotlight in the project. However, she and her members suspect that it is a ploy to keep their growing influence in check, something they are prepared for in order to catch Pulcinella and Pantalone off-guard after removing their "weakest" members to prevent themselves from getting exploited.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Into the Sunlight}}</ref>
