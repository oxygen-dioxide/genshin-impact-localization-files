{{Dialogue Start}}
:"...[[Kukulkan|My]] beloved [[Och-Kan|son]] is born, just as I had planned..."
:&nbsp;
:"...How beautiful he is, such a flawless creation. I can feel the blood of the dragon flowing through his veins. Even my [[Xiuhcoatl|brother]], should he lay eyes upon him, would struggle to discern his true lineage at first glance..."
:&nbsp;
:"...Beshackled by their feeble flesh, human souls are forever incapable of fully realizing their will. But not so my beloved son, for he shall surpass all of humanity and take his rightful place as the protagonist of my 'story'..."
:&nbsp;
:"...His strength is undeniable. Even within the confines of the [[vishap]]s' nest, when it comes to feeding time, he always claims the dragon's share. To conquer or be conquered, and grow stronger with every trial &mdash; just as it has been with all who have become dragons before him..."
:&nbsp;
:"...But I did not create him merely to raise another lord of dragonkind..."
:&nbsp;
:...
:&nbsp;
:"...Were I to steer him step by step, shaping his ascent to power just as I dictated, guiding him to rule over the human tribes and eventually become their king... Without question, he would make the choices laid out before him, the choices I envisioned. Then it would all be meaningless..."
:&nbsp;
:"...Perhaps it would be unwise to keep him here too long..."

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Before the descendants of the various tribes learned to record their history with woven scrolls, the ancient and proud nobility had already built a magnificent holy city here, scorning the land that those feeble slaves knew as "Natlantea." However, the vast empire that prided itself on its power has long since perished in battle. Only a lonely tomb remains of that mighty city.|[[Map]] marker description}}
