'''Ravenwood''' was a former Knight of Boreas who lived around 1,000 years ago, during the time of [[Vennessa]]'s rebellion against the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]]. He wielded a greatsword in battle.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Ferrous Shadow}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Ravenwood may be the Knight of Boreas mentioned in [[Wolf's Gravestone]], who is said to have stopped wandering upon reaching the [[City of Mondstadt]], much like how the [[Knights of Favonius]] were joined by the Knight of Boreas after Mondstadt's liberation from the aristocracy.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest|2}}</ref> However, there is currently too little information to be certain.
