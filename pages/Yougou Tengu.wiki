The {{Lang|'''Yougou Tengu'''|ja=影向天狗|ja_rm=Yougou Tengu}} are a group of [[tengu]] related to [[Mt. Yougou]]. They created the [[Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates]] at the end of the [[Araumi]] underground labyrinth, which housed the "[[Yougou Three]]" who trained under them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Narukami Trail}}</ref>

==Overview==
The Yougou Tengu appear to be an elite group of the [[Tengu]] species, responsible for protecting [[Mt. Yougou]] and consequently, the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] that sits upon it.

The names given by the Yougou Tengu are said to be blessed with divine powers. One such name was [[Iwakura Clan|Iwakura]], which was granted by Teruyo to [[Iwakura Michihiro]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Magnificent Tsuba}}</ref>
