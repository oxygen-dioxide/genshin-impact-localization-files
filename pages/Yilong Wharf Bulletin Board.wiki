:'''Reply:''' "Adepti have always gathered at Chenyu Vale since ancient times, and meeting an Adeptus isn't a miracle that only happens once every thousand years."
:'''Reply:''' "If this is true, your destiny seems to be entangled with the adepti. Why don't you ascend to [[Yilong Dais]] and offer a stick of our famous Crane Crown Incense to them to pray for your good fortune to last?"
