==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing Step 1 grants the {{Achievement|Vyakarana of the Birds}}.
* Completing Step 19 grants the {{Achievement|Fabricator-General}}.
* Completing the quest grants the {{Achievement|Trial of Haft-Vádí}}.
* '''The Great Songs of Khvarena''' in ''[[As the Khvarena's Light Shows: Samudaya]]'' and ''[[As the Khvarena's Light Shows: Dukkha]]'' can be interacted with before completing Step 4. However, they will not appear in the inventory until the quests are activated. The player must then return to the respective quest locations before the quests are considered completed and the Great Songs are added to the inventory.
* Going deeper from the floor with '''the Great Song of Khvarena''' will reveal an area with a lone {{Enemy|Hydro Hilichurl Rogue}}; progressing further inwards will reveal a strange ruin with what appears to be a [[Khaenri'ah]]n door, which in turn grants the {{Achievement|"...Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here."}}

{{Quest Description|Go to Zurvan to obtain the Twin-Horned Chaplet, and you will be able to go around collecting the Great Songs of Khvarena...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Zurvan)
:'''Zurvan:''' Well now! If it isn't Sorush and her Yasnapati.
:'''Zurvan:''' You sure did come back quickly. And while this might sound rude, you have exceeded my expectations.
:'''Sorush:''' Hmph. Whether it be foolish [[Mihir]] or ignorant [[Rashnu]], I have personally saved them and brought them back to our sea of flowers.
:'''Sorush:''' You will see me in a different light now, I trust, Elder?
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, Paimon thinks it's more accurate to say that we saved them together! {{Traveler}} put in tons of work too.
:'''Sorush:''' Hmph, you speak too much! I was planning to elevate you, too, to the position of my Yasnapati. But if you will be so petty, Pale Floater, it seems I must reconsider my decision.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... Actually, never mind. Who wants to be your Yasnapati anyway?
:'''Sorush:''' Now, it may seem strange to say so, but I believe myself and my Yasnapati to be of the same root and stem. Indivisible.
:'''Sorush:''' And just as the heroes of legend should have many helpers, my Yasnapati's works shall also count for my glory.
:'''Sorush:''' It also goes without saying that a [[Pari]] who shall do such a supreme deed as I will not peddle in the foolishness that is stealing another's credit.
:'''Sorush:''' Therefore, Yasnapati mine, feel free to add your deeds to the hymn, for thus shall my great deeds seem all the greater for it!
:{{DIcon}} By your leave, Your Grace.
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, stop it with the silly roleplay already!
:{{DIcon}} We're taking this a bit far, I think.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! We're quite used to you talking like this, Sorush, but Zurvan's right over there looking at us like we're a bunch of idiots!
:'''Sorush:''' *cough* Then let us not speak of things unrelated. Just as we agreed before, Elder, you can give me the Twin-Horned Chaplet now, yes?
:'''Zurvan:''' Well, we did. But I can't give you the Chaplet.
:'''Sorush:''' Wait! Are you going back on your word?
:'''Zurvan:''' Hehe. Now, the Chaplet is the symbol of Khvarena's recognition. How could it be given away based on private whims?
:'''Zurvan:''' Amidst the countless motes of Khvarena created by the transformed divine bird, only we Pari have been blessed with intelligence. It is thus that we are able to communicate with the remaining consciousness within the mother-tree and guide the power of Khvarena.
:'''Zurvan:''' But not all Pari may possess such authority.
:'''Zurvan:''' Only the Bloomguards, those who prove worthy successors to the divine bird's aspirations and have the courage to see that wish through, may gain the Chaplet, the crown that contains wisdom.
:'''Zurvan:''' Come, then. Pray along with me to the invincible Khvarena. If you have been acknowledged, then our god will grant you the Chaplet herself.

:{{Black Screen|Zurvan recites the words of an ancient hymn and Sorush joins her.<br>It is as if a thousand birds sing out at once, and as if a hundred flowers respond.}}

:;(Obtain {{Item|Sorush (Gadget)|text=Sorush (Bloomguard Form)}})

;(Talk to Zurvan)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, so the Chaplet just grows out of your head!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, this didn't go as we thought, but guess you've got your Twin-Horned Chaplet now, Sorush.
:{{DIcon}} You look much more reliable than before.
:'''Sorush:''' Haha! Of course! I am the destined "Bloomguard," after all!
:'''Sorush:''' Now I need only offer myself as a sacrifice to extinguish the Sign of Apaosha...
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh... And there you go, ruining our impression of you right away.
:'''Paimon:''' But since you've got the Chaplet, Sorush, now we can go find that Great Song of Khvarena thing, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers Nasejuna saying that we'll need to collect enough of those Great Songs if we want to perform that rite of his, and then we can pass through the darkness...
:'''Paimon:''' But who knows if his words can be relied on or not...
:'''Zurvan:''' That is the Rite of Chinvat. Now, is this Nasejuna you speak of from the [[Order of Skeptics]]? To think that any human remembers that rite. I thought that it had been lost.
:'''Zurvan:''' I did once travel alongside human heroes to cross the darkness through the Rite and cleanse the impurities tainting the mother-tree.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey, looks like he wasn't mistaken, then!
:'''Zurvan:''' But when that happened, I was the one who personally used the Khvarena to repair the seal that held the darkness at bay.
:'''Zurvan:''' Later, I was the one who fused the strongest Khvarena collected there into five Great Songs, which I used to purify the land.
:'''Zurvan:''' The Skeptics should not have knowledge of the Great Songs' existence if they relied merely on their traditional records.
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe Nasejuna's just that interested in researching documents? Maybe there are some documents he found elsewhere that you don't know about, Zurvan.
:'''Zurvan:''' That would make him all the more suspicious. As I understand it, there are indeed others who would be interested in the Great Songs...
:'''Zurvan:''' All the same, with you there, I believe such small matters should be no obstacle. In any case, Sorush has only just obtained the Chaplet and cannot collect enough Khvarena.
:'''Zurvan:''' If we wish to conduct the Rite of Chinvat now, we will need the power of the Great Songs.
:'''Zurvan:''' At that time, after I first scattered the monsters that had invaded our sea of flowers, the Great Songs were scattered across the land.
:'''Zurvan:''' Only one was hidden by me within the waters of the Sunyata Lake here, kept away for a future time of need.
:'''Zurvan:''' Now that Sorush has obtained the authority to touch the Great Songs, you can first go to obtain this one.
:'''Zurvan:''' As for the rest, you shall have to seek them out yourself. Safeguard them well! Do not let them fall into the hands of suspicious people.
:'''Zurvan:''' I would also ask you to take care of Sorush for me. Though she may have obtained the acknowledgment of Khvarena, I fear that wisdom and intelligence have never been prerequisites for becoming a "Bloomguard."

----
;(Approach the lake)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Something weird came out from the lake!
:'''Paimon:''' Is that a Great Song of Khvarena? ...&nbsp;Y'know, it looks kinda cute, actually!
:'''Paimon:''' It's a lot bigger than all the Khvarena we've seen previously... Maybe we could just call it "Great Khvarena" for short!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't think something this cute could be this good at cleansing the impurities, though.
:{{DIcon}} Well, Sorush is much the same.
:{{DIcon}} We've got another powerful cutie on our side here, don't we?
:'''Sorush:''' Pleasing to the ear, those words are not, but I shall take it that you praise my majesty nonetheless.

;(Obtain the Great Khvarena)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's one Great Khvarena down. Next, we just...
:'''Paimon:''' Um, wait a moment. We don't know where the rest are, do we?
:'''Sorush:''' No need to fret! I have already commanded Nasuraia regarding this matter. He already knows where the other four may be found.
:'''Sorush:''' We need only have him guide us.
:'''Paimon:''' Umm...
:'''Sorush:''' Well? Do you doubt my judgment?
:'''Paimon:''' Well... Paimon just thinks that Nasejuna's documents aren't all that reliable.
:'''Sorush:''' Hmph. This is different from the matter of the drums. The locations of the Great Songs of Khvarena were not found by consultation of the Skeptics' traditions, but through Nasuraia's own painstaking studies.
:'''Sorush:''' Apart from the ones locked within the ruins, I have personally checked the rest. There will be no errors.
:'''Sorush:''' Be assured, Pale Floater! I am the destined Bloomguard now. Would I make such mistakes?
:'''Paimon:''' Alright then. Paimon's not very assured, mind you. But we can always go ask Nasejuna first and stuff. Didn't he say he'd meet us at the camp?
:'''Sorush:''' Such considerations are unnecessary. Yours is to simply follow me and record mine accomplishments.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Great Song of Khvarena}})

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Nasejuna, optional)
:'''Nasejuna:''' (Why isn't Sorush back yet? I shouldn't have trusted them...)

;(Talk to Nasejuna)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Lady Sorush... Your present form is most astounding indeed...
:'''Nasejuna:''' Gazing upon your mighty form, I know in my heart that you must have been crowned the Bloomguard of the Pari, acknowledged by all!
:'''Sorush:''' Startle not, human. This was my calling from the beginning.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Of course, of course. Such majesty is only to be expected of the honored Envoy, one who shall obtain the Great Songs of Khvarena and extinguish the Sign of Apaosha!
:'''Sorush:''' Indeed, your words are most suited to be inscribed in the hymns that shall be written in mine honor!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh... Nasejuna's still his usual self. Paimon's not sure how to feel about this.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Ah yes, Yasnapati, Paimon, you too deserve thanks in this matter.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Though your endeavors are naught but the afterglow of the Envoy's mighty works, your labor in Lady Sorush's successful obtaining of her crown shall not be voided.
:'''Paimon:''' That's not how it went, buddy, but we'll just take this as your way of saying thanks!
:'''Nasejuna:''' Haha. Our mission now is to search for the Great Songs of Khvarena, and the long-awaited Rite may then be performed.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Speaking of the Great Songs, they are inextricably linked to the destiny of us Skeptics...
:{{DIcon}} Is it story time again?
::'''Paimon:''' Wait a moment. Didn't Zurvan say that the Great Songs have nothing to do with humanity?
::'''Nasejuna:''' Um... Did the Elder say that?
::'''Nasejuna:''' Then, well, how should I say this? My documents state clearly that...
::'''Paimon:''' Then your documents aren't very reliable, are they? Paimon thinks that Zurvan, who has lived for several hundred years, would definitely be more reliable than some notes!
::'''Sorush:''' Peace! Such trivialities do not rise to the honor of entering my annals.
::'''Sorush:''' If I do not offer myself up as a sacrifice to save this land, those who come after may read these texts and suspect that I was a spirit of laxity.
:{{DIcon}} Hang on a second, Zurvan said that...
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. Didn't Zurvan say that you guys shouldn't know about the Great Songs' existence?
::'''Nasejuna:''' Yes, it is indeed true that the ancient rites have stopped being passed down through our Order. If I had relied solely on our traditions, I suspect that even the Rite of Chinvat might still be shrouded in mystery.
::'''Nasejuna:''' But I gained access to a large batch of long-lost documents from a very learned scholar. That was where I learned about the Great Songs.
::'''Nasejuna:''' Those documents recorded a great number of things that the traditional hymns of our Order have never written of. That also inspired in me the desire to reform our Order.
::'''Paimon:''' That doesn't really help, you know. Your traditions are already pretty suspect. How are we supposed to trust these documents, then? They might've come outta nowhere for all we know!
::'''Sorush:''' Enough. These sideshows are not fit to be written into my songs. If you so wish to tell truth from falsehood, then let us go and see for ourselves rather than quibble here.
::'''Sorush:''' Why, if I do not offer myself up as a sacrifice to save this land soon, those who come after may read these texts and suspect that I was a spirit of laxity.
:'''Nasejuna:''' No, no, how could that be? I do not believe any would hold to such contemptuous thoughts!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm. Paimon thinks that you just want us to hurry up and collect those Great Khvarena, Sorush.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... Since when did Paimon become your translator?
:'''Sorush:''' Hmph. To think that you, Pale Floater, should understand my thoughts best.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Since it is your command, great Envoy, allow me to lead the way.
:'''Nasejuna:''' It seems that you have obtained one of the Great Songs. It is just as well, then, that I have discovered the locations of the remaining four.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Although I have not been to those underground ruins myself, I am as familiar with them as I am with this camp.
:{{DIcon}} That seems like an overstatement, but alright.
:{{DIcon}} Knew we could count on you.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Haha. Well, the Great Songs are items that I do desire to win, especially after all that effort...
:'''Nasejuna:''' *cough* Well, let's not speak of unrelated matters. Come with me, everyone.
----
;(After completing [[As the Khvarena's Light Shows: Samudaya]])
:'''Paimon:''' We found another Great Khvarena! And. in a place like this, too!
:'''Paimon:''' If we hadn't lowered the water level using the control devices, we never would've found this place.

;(After completing [[As the Khvarena's Light Shows: Dukkha]])
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! We got another Great Khvarena!<!-- this line probably changes if you did this first, second, or last. I did it 2nd -->
:'''Nasejuna:''' But with how little effect the Great Song of Khvarena is having even in the immediate vicinity of the petrified Setekh Wenut, it seems like it only affects those related to the Abyss.
:'''Paimon:''' We can look into this after we find all of the Great Songs of Khvarena. Let's go to the next spot!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|You follow Nasejuna into the ancient Khaenri'ahn ruins to obtain the final Great Song of Khvarena...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the locked door)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well then, let me help you open this door. The final Great Song of Khvarena can be found in this underground Dahrian factory!
:'''Nasejuna:''' We are merely one step away, but knowing that we are so close to collecting all the Great Songs, even I feel rather excited.
:{{DIcon}} Well, go ahead and do your work, then.
::'''Nasejuna:''' Haha, long have I prepared for this moment.
:{{DIcon}} (Hesitate a little.)
::'''Nasejuna:''' What? Are you afraid, now that we're here?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, it's just that... You might have read those notes, Nasejuna, but Paimon thinks you're a little too good at working with these ruin machines.
::'''Nasejuna:''' But of course. While you were away, I was making preparations the entire time.

;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Hah! There we go. Inside at last!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, this looks like the main hall. What should we do next?
:'''Nasejuna:''' Hmm, let me think. Just like the previous ruins we've explored, this should also be the energy control hub for the entire ruin.
:'''Nasejuna:''' If the documents I have read are accurate, this place was used as a manufacturing center, and it was owned by the Dahri warrior band known as the Schwanenritter, just as the proving ground from earlier was.
:'''Nasejuna:''' According to these records, they resisted the monsters that surged forth from beneath the earth during the cataclysm that occurred 500 years ago.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Ah, but that's not important right now. Whatever the case, my notes say that the Great Song we must claim here is at the very bottom of this factory.
:'''Nasejuna:''' We will need to use the elevator to reach that location, which means that activating said elevator is our present problem.
:'''Nasejuna:''' But just as with the previous ruins, the relays powering the elevator have been sealed by Gray Crystals. We will need to find Farrwicks to eliminate them.
:'''Nasejuna:''' It seems we'll need... three of those. The notes seem to say that these ruins should contain quite a few of them, though, so we might as well have a look around the adjoining rooms.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, you say that, but the doors all around look closed. Doesn't look like we're going anywhere fast.
:'''Sorush:''' Hmph. Pale Floater, you fret over-much. All places are accessible to those who use Khvarena. And is not one of the Farrwicks you wish to find here?
:'''Nasejuna:''' Exactly. As long as we use the Farrwicks to break the seals over the relays, we can use the mixer to transfer power over to the devices near the doors to open them.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well, let's give this a go all the same.

;(Open the first door)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, it really opened!
:'''Paimon:''' In that case, let's do the same with the door on the other side!
:'''Nasejuna:''' I'd love to go over there and have a look. My notes say that this factory's smelting center lies that way.
:'''Nasejuna:''' But seeing the state of these relays, we will need another Farrwick to activate the door here.
:'''Nasejuna:''' And if we want to activate the elevator, we will need to unseal all three of these relays...
:'''Nasejuna:''' Considering that, could we trouble you and our great Envoy to go find it?
:'''Sorush:''' Oh? You almost sound like you presume to command me.
:'''Nasejuna:''' ...Oh no, no, of course, I would never dare do such a thing, O Great Envoy. Yet this is a great task that only you may accomplish!
:'''Nasejuna:''' You and your Yasnapati truly work wonders that a mere mortal such as I cannot aid in accomplishing, and as such, mine is only to wait for your return.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Still, do take these investigation notes along with you, so that you shall not lose your way. It contains the locations of all the Farrwicks you must find.
;(Open [[Rene's Investigation Notes]])
::<div style="font-size:1.2em"><p align="center">'''Rene's Investigation Notes'''</p></div><hr />
::<div align="center">[[File:Rene's Investigation Notes Image.png|300px]]</div>
::...Analysis of the nature of Vourukasha Oasis... intriguing. The structure of the so-called "[[Gaokerena|sacred lotus]]" is similar to the composition of mine and [[Jakob]]'s bodies... yet it has almost no common properties with that of [[Karl Ingold|Mr. Karl]]. A strange result, one that will require more data samples to verify... the Shamaniyya won't let us take any samples. How churlish...
::...We ate dried bread. The jam is nearly gone...<br><br>
::...Compared to the powers of the Elements, the power of Khvarena is actually more similar to ██... It assimilates whatever materials and energies it comes into contact with... though the Khvarena is opposed to the energy of ██, it does similarly have a form of self-recognition. On this point, the two possess the same properties... just as tinctures of mercury will not mix with water, but will do so with other...
::...We can reasonably infer that the power of Khvarena might be the same as the power of ██... the result of being projected onto this world. Perhaps it is precisely because of such thinking that those petty Shamaniyya came up with the notion of "conflict"... More importantly, we might be able to combine Khaenri'ahn records to deduce their world-formula based on this...
::...There was much to consider today, so I decided to eat a couple more sweets. Finished off the jam...<br><br>
::...He sometimes cries in secret. It's understandable, I think. All my teeth have come in, so I'm an adult now, but he's only just had his third tooth come in... This would normally be time for afternoon tea at the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute|Institute]]. At the moment, I don't know what [[Alain Guillotin|Alain]]...
::...I told him that the [[Basil Elton|Vice Director]] said she would definitely return. She's amazing, always keeps her word, and is an adult who never tricks children. But seeing all of this, I am starting to think that she will be unable to return. Jakob has certainly thought this too.
::...Split the last of the jam between myself and Jakob...<br><br>
::...Based on the Khaenri'ahn records, this place produces "[[Azosite]]" (a block of energy of some kind). It is certainly convenient, and at least appears to be relatively stable and safe... It seems that the original plan was to use it as the power source for some sort of agricultural machine...
::...Though the results are nothing impressive, this is because the object they chose was pure elemental force, which lacks any will whatsoever. Like the difference between the [[Lyris|Director]] and a Hydro Slime, perhaps? Based on her nature, she shouldn't die. At least, I hope not...<br><br>
::...So weak. If we don't take any measures, it's unlikely that we will endure long enough to return to [[Fontaine]]...
::...Should be able to use this power... furious. But it's understandable, given that even homes this far apart have been flooded, an attitude of resistance to this kind of power is normal. But we must preserve Jakob's life. After all, the Narzissenkreuz Institute...
::...Lost consciousness... But I do not think power can be classified as right or wrong. Adults are too pedantic...
::...only remembered I hadn't eaten. Today's meal was only dried bread without jam...<br><br>
::...Regained consciousness... Jakob forgot, so Mr. Karl became suspicious, but the fake journal should still be effective for now...
::...Intriguing data was gained during the process... based on the documents left behind by the Khaenri'ahns and this data, we can obtain some of the formulae...
::...To celebrate and help Jakob supplement his nutritional intake (even though there's no need, I already told him that we must keep up the ruse), Mr. Karl foraged some nuts. We boiled them down into jam, which used up our remaining sugar. But that's fine. If things go to plan, we can return soon...<br><br>
::...Can be deduced all the way until the second flood period's (I've decided to call the previous incident that flooded the courtyard the first flood period, so as to better separate the two! The names being too similar caused Jakob to input the wrong data) tail end...
::...Though I don't want to admit it, but no matter how many times the calculations are run, the result is the same. I cross-checked with Jakob... unbelievable. Destruction? Did I miss a variable? I must check the calculations again tomorrow...<br><br>
::...The results are as clear as a coin at the bottom of the [[Fountain of Lucine]]! Jakob also saw similar scenes... There should be a way... No, there must be a way...
::...Actually thought of a possible breakthrough during the process... Even though the calculated result is unchanged, but if the refinement method is reflected... If the power of... then maybe we can extract the "will" within. Using this method... resist the impact...<br><br>
::...We begin our journey back to Fontaine tomorrow. This trip paid enormous dividends, and much of what was learned will be applicable... A larger catastrophe must be avoided. The plan should be fine. Nothing more than a question of what Jakob and I can do. Jakob is scared, because he is still a child. But he already has strength greater than most adults. With us, and Alain, we can surely stop the disaster.
::Must speak with Alain upon our return.
:'''Nasejuna:''' It took me much effort to obtain this information, so do keep it safe.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Without the notes to guide me, I shall not be able to leave this place alone. And you would not leave a poor man such as I here in the dust, would you?

;(Talk to Nasejuna again)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Without the notes to guide me, I shall not be able to leave this place alone. And you would not leave a poor man such as I here in the dust, would you?

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Nasejuna, optional)
:'''Nasejuna:''' (We have finally progressed to this phase. The next step to follow will be simple...)

----
;(Pick up the second Farrwick)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we've finally got the Farrwick. Let's head back to the main hall.
:'''Paimon:''' That Nasejuna guy's a real weirdo, but we can't just leave him there like that...

;(Return to Nasejuna)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Oh my! You're finally back.
:'''Nasejuna:''' I was beside myself with worry! If some frozen beast were to suddenly revive themselves, I would have been done for, no doubt.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Fortunately, nothing of the sort happened.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well then, that's two Farrwicks we have obtained. In that case, let's open the door on the right, just as before. Following that, if you'll allow it, I shall follow you onward.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, that's a huge furnace. It's super hot! How is it still in operation?
:'''Nasejuna:''' This giant furnace is used to make a substance known as Azosite. It is the core of this entire factory, and the Energy Blocks we saw earlier were derived from this place.
:'''Paimon:''' But shouldn't this place have been abandoned ages ago? No one should have been able to get in here!
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well, there might be some paths in here that we're not sure of. Those people who worship the dark abyss... and perhaps even the "Fatui" you spoke of may have entered.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Surely, now that I consider it, the Great Songs might have been stolen by now, were it not for the fact that only Lady Sorush may touch them.
:'''Sorush:''' Hah! Worthless worries. The Great Songs of Khvarena are my destined inheritance. That any others might taint them with their touch... Inconceivable!
:'''Nasejuna:''' Indeed, indeed, it is so. But we must find one more Farrwick to activate the relays sealed in crystal, if you are to claim your destiny.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Then, we can activate that elevator and go to where the Great Song awaits us.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Come then, let us go.

;(Obtaining the third Farrwick)
:'''Paimon:''' Finally found it! Let's go back and activate that sealed power relay, shall we?
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see... We should return to where we began if we follow the path on the left.

;(Return to the control room)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Hah, do you see that giant machine up there?
:'''Nasejuna:''' That is the central control device of this entire factory. As long as we can get the energy from the relays to that center and then activate this device, we shall be able to activate the elevator.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Whatever the case, let's hurry and unseal the relays, then use the mixer, as before, to connect this circuit.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm...
:'''Nasejuna:''' What is it? This is no time to retreat.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah. You know what? You know this place too well, Nasejuna. It's like you've been here before or something.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't you find it weird too, Sorush?
:'''Sorush:''' Well, that is true, but he is a human Vijnanapati. Surely this is not beyond him?
:'''Nasejuna:''' Hmph. Don't look down on us scholarly types! With the aid of these documents that I read in the mountains, even I can master these devices.
:'''Nasejuna:''' And I have not only read all the books within the House of Daena, but I have spent much time collecting tomes heretofore hidden.
:'''Nasejuna:''' As the great Envoy commanded me, I have always paid special attention to records concerning the Great Songs of Khvarena and underground ruins.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Tell me, is deriving recorded truth from documents not the essential work of those whose preoccupation is such writings?
:'''Nasejuna:''' And even if you should suspect me, let us save that until we have obtained the Great Song of Khvarena! You would not abandon me here at this juncture, would you?
:'''Nasejuna:''' Please, let us focus on resolving the matter of this elevator!

;(Activate all 3 devices)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Good, good. Now we need only activate the central control device at the control platform above, and the elevator should be restored to normal function.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well then, Yasnapati of her Eminence, the great Envoy, I leave that to you. I still have work to do here in examining these aged machines.
:'''Nasejuna:''' We are finally here. The preparations I made were not in vain.
:'''Nasejuna:''' And yet, let us leave celebrations till later. Who knows what dangers yet lie ahead?

;(Talk to Nasejuna again)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Now we need only activate the central control device, and the elevator should be restored to normal functionality.

;(Activate the central device)
:'''Nasejuna:''' Finally! Now we need only use this elevator, and we shall reach the deepest section of this factory.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well, my notes do also say that a path into an underground realm still deeper down than this factory may be found there...
:'''Nasejuna:''' But that is not a place we can reach.
:'''Nasejuna:''' The road ahead of us is perilous, but I will not falter at the precipice this time.
:'''Nasejuna:''' This may be considered the deepest parts of the surface realms, after all. If a researcher such as myself were to stop here, I would surely shame the name of my Order.
:'''Nasejuna:''' As always, I leave myself in your able hands, Yasnapati, Honored Envoy.

;(Obtain the final {{Item|Great Song of Khvarena}})
:'''Paimon:''' Nice! And that's all five Great Khvarena in our hands!
:'''Paimon:''' Now we just need to take 'em over to Zurvan in the sea of flowers and perform that Ritual of... whatever we're calling it.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Please wait! As I see it, these Great Songs should go to me first.
:'''Nasejuna:''' As I mentioned before, I must still examine these Great Songs more carefully before the Rite of Chinvat can begin.
:'''Nasejuna:''' And did I not put in much effort toward finding them as well? If I were not present, you might yet be stumbling blind through this factory.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's what it looked like, yeah...
:'''Nasejuna:''' Yes, yes, reasonable, is it not? Come then, give me the Great Songs, quickly now... That way, I can draw up a procedure for the ritual first...
:'''Nasejuna:''' ...Yes, that's right. That's my work, too, after all!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm. Y'know, the more you talk, the more suspicious Paimon's getting...
:{{DIcon}} That will be unnecessary.
::'''Sorush:''' It is as my Yasnapati says. You need simply await the completion of my heroic deed, Nasuraia.
:{{DIcon}} Let's have Sorush decide.
::'''Sorush:''' Hmph. I see no reason to branch from our path now. You need simply await the completion of my heroic deed, Nasuraia.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Silence! You piss me off!
:'''Sorush:''' Nasuraia, you dare...!
:'''Nasejuna:''' Hah! Well. I've said it now, haven't I? I've blown my cover.
:'''Nasejuna:''' But ah, it is such a liberating feeling, to no longer have to grovel and nod before this idiot of a Pari.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well! Where should we begin? Even I'm not very sure.
:'''Nasejuna:''' I'd love to tell you all about my plans. Dead people tell no tales, after all. But I'd wager you'd not like to hear of such convoluted matters much.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Why don't you just hand the Great Songs over? That'll save me time.
:'''Paimon:''' Nope, not happening! We spent so much effort getting them, and if we don't have 'em, our commission's a non-starter!
:'''Paimon:''' Zurvan also said that we'd be idiots to give them to you!
:'''Nasejuna:''' Bah! Sideshows, all of that, compared to my plans! I've been playing house with you imbeciles this entire time, just to get the Great Songs!
:'''Nasejuna:''' They call me Vijnanapati at the Order, but they could never understand my labors, and so I acted in secret. I had to!
:'''Nasejuna:''' In order to get in contact with Khvarena constructs, I came up with the idea of using the Rite of Chinvat to extinguish the Sign and lured in Sorush...
:'''Nasejuna:''' And that was already a pain in the neck. You've seen it, how most Pari are just obstinate cretin.
:'''Nasejuna:''' But she was truly useless! Her constant failure to obtain that Chaplet had me on the verge of giving up!
:'''Nasejuna:''' It was thanks to you two, ultimately, that the Chaplet was gained, and that we made it all the way here! Now, it won't please you, but I am very grateful.
:{{DIcon}} Well, that's a bit too harsh on Sorush.
::'''Nasejuna:''' Is that even important!?
::'''Nasejuna:''' The songs of the Skeptics do record that some humans did become companions of the Pari. But were it not for the Great Songs, I would never have associated with them at all.
:{{DIcon}} You deceived us, then.
::'''Nasejuna:''' Call it mere omission. I am, after all, indeed preparing for the Rite of Chinvat.
:'''Nasejuna:''' All that is left now is to use the Great Songs of Khvarena to reverse the Rite of Chinvat, which will release the seal on the Abyss... and the wars of old will begin anew!
:'''Nasejuna:''' Oh, the expectation! Does it not kill you inside? Shame, then, that you shan't see that glorious sight.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, but isn't your Order supposed to help suppress the Abyss? Why do you want to unseal it instead...
:{{DIcon}} You've turned your back on your duties.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Ah, but have you not considered other possibilities?
:'''Nasejuna:''' Just as you have seen, the Skeptics' documents are a pile of raving-mad myths, while Dahri records are factual. Precise.
:'''Nasejuna:''' As I see it, the "history" and the "duty" of the Order of Skeptics are but tall tales, invented from nothing.
:'''Nasejuna:''' My discoveries in the ruins only proved my judgment astute. I found a great many interesting things there, just so you know.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well, I have managed to enter this place at times, in secret, alongside the lector who gave me the notes. But this is the first time things went so well.
:'''Nasejuna:''' According to my research, those who resisted the impurities here were heroes of the Dahri. They are the Skeptics' true ancestors.
:'''Nasejuna:''' But they were forgotten. Their tale untold. They were smeared as sinners. As the cause behind the disaster.
:'''Nasejuna:''' Their deeds were wiped from the records by the thrice-be-damned Akademiya, and then mistakenly appropriated as a founding myth by the Skeptics... I suspect this is why the Akademiya never intended to accept us.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like speculation to me.
::'''Nasejuna:''' No! This is the truth, which I discovered with my own hands.
:{{DIcon}} Regardless, betrayal is betrayal.
::'''Nasejuna:''' I am merely ending this fratricidal farce.
:'''Nasejuna:''' I did say so earlier, did I not? I found some interesting records in the ruins. For example, Dahri records of that sign in the sky.
:'''Nasejuna:''' They called this the Sign of Truth, believing that it reflected the "reality" beyond our skies...
:'''Nasejuna:''' That is my plan. To bring truth without mercy to this unjust world!
:'''Nasejuna:''' Now then. My great work requires the Great Songs of Khvarena, so hand them over. If you come quietly, perhaps I might spare you.
:'''Paimon:''' And what'll you do, snatch it? It's gonna be pretty tough for you, y'know...
:'''Nasejuna:''' Well, that's too bad. I've come prepared!
:;(Nasejuna's eyes look over to his right.)
:'''Nasejuna:''' ... My apologies for the wait, O Priest of the Dark Hollow.

;(Enter combat with an Abyss Herald and Nasejuna)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, Nasejuna called for backup!
:'''Klingsor:''' Outlander, hand over the Khvarena!
:'''Klingsor:''' Their power is more useful to me than it is to you!

;(After defeating Nasejuna)
:'''Nasejuna:''' No! How could this be...!? Looks like I must retreat. Come up with another plan...

;(After defeating the Abyss Herald)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, where's Nasejuna gone off to? He was hiding over there a moment ago...
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh. How could we have let him slip off like that!?
:'''Paimon:''' To think that he'd gang up with the Abyss Order to take our Great Khvarena! And what was that crazy nonsense he was going on and on about?
:{{DIcon}} This one was a long time coming.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, now that you mention it, he was pretty suspicious right from the start. And given what Zurvan told us, she must have realized something as well, right?
:{{DIcon}} This is still rather concerning...
::'''Paimon:''' That's true. We can't really trust what Nasejuna says, but Zurvan might still know something about the Khaenri'ahns who fought against the monsters here.
:'''Paimon:''' In that case, let's bring these Great Khvarena back and get some answers from Zurvan.
:'''Paimon:''' As for the Order, didn't Nasejuna say that he was keeping them in the dark too?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we shouldn't rule out the possibility that some of them might have been swayed to Nasejuna's side, but Paimon thinks Pyrrho and some others didn't know what was going on.
:'''Paimon:''' If we've got the time, let's tell 'em the truth!
:'''Sorush:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Whatever the case, let's head back to the sea of flowers. We've gotta make sure that nothing bad happens, after all!

;(Talk to Pyrrho)
:'''Pyrrho:''' Well, why are you back? Did you get the door slammed on you by our great Vijnanapati? I'll have you know that he doesn't compromise so easily with the Pari.
:'''Pyrrho:''' You should just leave. And don't even think of getting anything more from me!
:'''Paimon:''' Pfft! You spilled the beans without our help every time, though!
:{{DIcon}} So, about your Vijnanapati...
:{{DIcon}} Well, you say he's different, but...
:{{Black Screen|You tell Pyrrho of the Great Songs and Nasejuna's betrayal.}}
:'''Pyrrho:''' Nonsense. Utter nonsense! Our Vijnanapati is the most scholarly man I know. He would not band together with those defiled beings!
:'''Pyrrho:''' I'll bet you're just trying to mask your failure by sowing dissent.
:'''Pyrrho:''' Nice try, but your story's way out there. No way I'd fall for that!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... C'mon, we gotta think. Don't we have those notes that Nasejuna gave us?
:'''Paimon:''' It should still have Nasejuna's notes. Pyrrho should believe us if we give those to him!
:'''Pyrrho:''' What notes are these? You really love those tricks of yours, don't you?
:{{Black Screen|You give Rene's Investigation Notes to Pyrrho.}}
:'''Pyrrho:''' This... This is indeed the great Vijnanapati's handwriting...
:'''Pyrrho:''' It truly was a once-in-a-lifetime thing that we gained such a knowledgeable leader, and yet he turned his back on our duties and threw his lot with the followers of the dark hollow...
:'''Pyrrho:''' *sigh* You may not know this, but we have struggled against the followers of the dark hollow for hundreds of years.
:'''Pyrrho:''' You could say that they are akin to our shadow, always attempting to taint our heritage. I have no doubt that the fall of our order to its present state cannot be separated from their plots.
:'''Pyrrho:''' But I never thought that this time, even our leader would be... Ah, a plague upon our house, this is!
:'''Pyrrho:''' No doubt Nasejuna has gone with those impure villains and now skulks with them in the shadows.
:'''Pyrrho:''' In the past, he followed Elder [[Aryadeva]] to the Akademiya, and upon returning, he was absorbed with those ancient documents.
:'''Pyrrho:''' We were people who emphasized praxis, and we found ourselves without a scholar like him for many years. I had thought that he would lead us to reform, but...
:{{DIcon}} Honestly, we didn't see that one coming either.
:{{DIcon}} This wasn't your fault.
:'''Pyrrho:''' But since this is how things have played out, I must handle that which remains to be done.
:'''Pyrrho:''' Our first priority is to appoint a new Vijnanapati. Things would go ill if someone takes advantage of this vacuum.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon's really not sure if you have much of a vacuum worth sneaking into now...
:'''Pyrrho:''' Indeed, and I am ashamed of it. As penance, allow me to give you these documents that Nasejuna left in my keeping. They record the various traditions of our Order.
:'''Pyrrho:''' Although I have not been able to understand it, I believe it might be of interest to you, so please, take it.
:'''Pyrrho:''' And if you should have any trouble in the future, just seek me out, and I will lend you my aid.
