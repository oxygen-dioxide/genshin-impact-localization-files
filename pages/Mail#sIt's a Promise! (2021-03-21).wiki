|text    = I was in the middle of my chivalric training today when I received a bouquet of fresh flowers from the citizens of [[Mondstadt]].

Master [[Jean]] said that it was a token of gratitude from everyone and wished me a happy birthday.

I don't expect anyone to repay me for my help, but I am moved that they remembered me because of that.

I feel like I've improved a little compared to last year...

But I'm still far from becoming your reliable shield.

This is one of my dreams. I need to try harder for your sake!

I can't wait to show you the fruits of my determination!

Just wait until my next birthday!
