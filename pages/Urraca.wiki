==Story==
The parents of Urraca are merchants who are often out working and not interested in the lives of their children. Urraca is 16 years old and a 3rd year student with mediocre results. He spent a lot of money on tutoring and his gambling addiction. This has led him to search "even illegal" ways to obtain money, and so he listened to [[Sethos]] proposing a plan of extorting [[Cyrus (Sumeru)|Cyrus]] for a lot of money. The boy is quickly caught by [[Cyno]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Mysterious Letter}}</ref>
