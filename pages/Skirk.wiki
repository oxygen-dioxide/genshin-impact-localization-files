{{Quote|Yet, his "Foul Legacy" was not originally his. Rather, it was taught to him by that solitary girl who dwelt in the darkest corners of the universe.|[[Childe: Foul Legacy]] Namecard}}
'''Skirk''' is the mysterious swordswoman whom [[Tartaglia]] describes as his master<ref name="TartVO">{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About Skirk}}</ref> and is likely the one who taught him the art of battle during his time in [[the Abyss]].<ref name="Tart4">{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|4}}</ref><ref group="Note">Strictly speaking, the name "Skirk" appears only in Tartaglia's voiceline. However, as Tartaglia himself and his backstory consistently talk about his background as if he has only one main martial-arts master, it can be assumed that the master Skirk and the master in his backstory are the same person.</ref>

==Profile==
So far, Skirk has only been mentioned in regards to Tartaglia's backstory. According to Tartaglia, Skirk is an exceptionally skilled and seasoned warrior; while he is known as one of the most dangerous among the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]<ref>{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|Character Details}}</ref> and was explicitly recruited for his combat prowess,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|5}}</ref> he states that she could easily beat him with one hand. He is optimistic that in their next encounter at his current power, he can force her to use both of them.<ref name="TartVO" />

She is said to live in another ancient world, the dark realm,<ref name="Tart4" /> or the darkest corners of the universe.<ref>Namecard: [[Childe: Foul Legacy]]</ref> In her realm, time flows differently from the known world; three months in her realm amount to three days in [[Teyvat]]. Although her affiliation with the [[Abyss Order]] is not attested, she at least knows how to survive in the Abyss and taught the way to Childe.<ref name="Tart4" />

==Character Mentions==
{{Character Mentions|alias="a mysterious swordswoman"|S-Tartaglia-Character Story 4=The "mysterious swordswoman" is implied to be Skirk by Tartaglia's voice-over about her and his namecard description.}}

==Trivia==
*She is speculated to have some connection to [[Khaenri'ah]] or the [[Abyss Order]], considering she is a warrior who dwells in the Abyss.
**Tartaglia's melee combat style, which he learned from Skirk, bears similarity to the [[Abyss Herald]]s' Hydro abilities (see [[Tartaglia/Lore#Trivia|his Trivia section]] for details).
*It is unclear whether the quotes within [[Enter the Golden House#Boss Description|Childe]]'s Archive description is narrated by Skirk or the [[Tsaritsa]].
*It is also speculated that she could belong to the [[Hexenzirkel]] since she was dwelling so deep inside the abyss, reinforced by the fact her powers seem to be that of which we have not encountered yet similar to [[Alice]].
