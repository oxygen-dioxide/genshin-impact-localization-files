'''Rene de Petrichor'''<ref name="FCF">{{Ref/Item|Fleuve Cendre Ferryman}}</ref> was a [[Fontaine|Fontainian]] historical figure from the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago. The son of the then-mayor of [[Poisson]], [[Renault de Petrichor]],<ref name="FCF" /> Rene is best known for researching [[Khaenri'ah]]n technology at the [[Girdle of the Sands]], [[Sumeru]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Khvarena's Light Shows}}</ref> He is also a close friend and likely the adoptive older brother of [[Jakob Ingold]], and the founder of [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]].

Rene has history with many of the other notable factions before and after the [[cataclysm]] era, such as Poisson, the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]], and the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]].

==Profile==
Rene is a child prodigy. In his young age, he deduced the "world-formula" through reverse-engineering the data left by Khaenri'ah.<ref name="ReneNote">{{Ref/Item|Rene's Investigation Notes}}</ref> Rene seems to only acknowledge the intellect and talent of [[Alain Guillotin]], looking down upon the intelligence of others. For instance, in his [[Rene's Investigation Notes|investigation notes]] and [[Enigmatic Page]]s, he mentions that "adults are too pedantic," the members of the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]] have limited imagination, and the plans of the [[Remuria|ancients]] are "anti-intellectual and counter-intuitive."

However, despite Alain's disbelief in the "world-formula" and his rejection of Rene and Jakob's requests,<ref name="Book">{{Ref/Quest|Book of Esoteric Revelations}}</ref><ref name="Log5">Interactable: [[Ancient Log#Ancient Log #5|Ancient Log #5]]</ref> the relationship between them ruptured due to the accident involving Carter,<ref name="Page5">{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (V)}}</ref> even when Alain defeated Rene (as a part of [[Master]]) within Elynas' remnants,<ref name="Monocle">{{Ref/Arti|Fell Dragon's Monocle}}</ref> Rene did not blame Alain. He believed that it was merely because Alain had not witnessed the [[??? (Fontaine)|apocalypse views]] that Rene and other Ordo members had seen. After Rene's rebirth as the Master, he still seeks cooperation with Alain and aims to prove his "world-formula" to him.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Scattered Page}}</ref><ref name="Page12">{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (XII)}}</ref>

[[Nasejuna]] calls Rene an "excellent scholar of ancient histories," and uses [[Rene's Investigation Notes]] as a basis for his exploration of Khaenri'ahn ruins.<ref name="Nirodha">{{Ref/Quest|As the Khvarena's Light Shows: Nirodha}}</ref> During his investigations, Rene drew similarities between the power of [[Khvarena]] and a censored word,<ref name="ReneNote" /> likely meant to be the [[Abyss]],<ref>Interactable: [[Gavireh Lajavard#Bizarre Transcript|Bizarre Transcript]]</ref> and "discovered knowledge that 'surpasses mortals'."<ref name="Nirodha" />

==History==
===Childhood===
Rene was born as the son of Renault de Petrichor, Mayor of [[Poisson]], before the [[Siege of Poisson]]. At some point in his childhood, he met [[Jakob]] and the two became friends. Before the Siege of Poisson got worse, [[Karl Ingold]] took a photo of Rene and Jakob along with other figures such as Jakob's biological father [[Eduardo Baker]], Renault and [[Parsifal the Great]]. During his time, the siege was soon stopped by the [[Marechaussee Phantom]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Fleuve Cendre Ferryman}}</ref>

During the siege, both Renault and Eduardo may have died. This led to both Rene and Jakob being taken in by the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]], where they met [[Alain]] and [[Mary-Ann]]. During his times there, Rene often played as the "dragon" while Alain played as the heroic "knight".<ref name="Monocle" /><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Wicked Mage's Plumule}}</ref>

===Later life===
After it became evident that [[Lyris]], the Director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, and [[Basil Elton]], the vice-director, would never return, the Narzissenkreuz Institute disbanded. [[Emanuel Guillotin]] took in Alain and Mary-Ann as his children while Jakob was taken in by [[Karl Ingold]]. Rene was most likely also taken in by Karl.<ref group="Note" name="ReneSurname">There are currently no signs indicating that Rene changed his surname to Ingold. Rene refers to Karl as "Mr. Karl" and {{zh|卡尔叔叔|tl=Uncle Karl}} in Chinese. He also refers to Emanuel as "Uncle Guillotin."</ref>

Karl, Rene, and Jakob travelled to the [[Girdle of the Sands]] and studied the [[Harvisptokhm]]'s Gaokerena, which contained the consciousness of the former Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]]. Rene realized that its composition was similar to his and Jakob's bodies. Rene's research gained the suspicion of Karl, who was there accompanying Rene and Jakob.

While investigating Elynas' remains, Jakob and Rene coincidentally encountered Alain, Mary-Ann, and Emanuel Guillotin, who were gathering research of their own for Alain's project at the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]].<ref name="Log1">Interactable: [[Ancient Log#Ancient Log #1|Ancient Log #1]]</ref> Although they were elated to see their old friends again, Rene was wary of Emanuel due to his involvement in the Siege of Poisson and did not reveal Jakob's secret to the Guillotin siblings.<ref name="Page2">{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (II)}}</ref> Afterwards, Alain recommended Jakob and Rene to the Institute's director (who was likely [[Dwight Lasker]]).<ref name="Log1" />

===The Narzissenkreuz Ordo===
After Rene finished his research, he then formed the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]] after seeing the people at the Institute of Natural Philosophy turn into "believers". He decides to make them join the Ordo to give them a sense of belonging.<ref name="Page5" /> At that time, Jakob could now transform into an [[Iniquitous Baptist]], while Carter was still unconscious from the experiment, though he partially showed some signs of life.

At some point in time, Rene conducted an experiment on [[Carter Scherbius]], who was Alain's assistant, in an attempt to "save his life". This experiment created a rift between Alain and Rene along with Jakob.

Soon, Lyris joined the Ordo. Though she was apprehensive, Rene successfully received Lyris' consciousness. Finally, Rene dissolves himself first by merging her consciousness together with his, eventually creating the [[Narzissenkreuz|Master]].<ref name="Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page IX"/>

==Legacy==
Following the creation of the Master, figures such as [[Emanuel Guillotin]] and [[Marfisa]] were absorbed by him. However, the Master still had the memories of Rene. He then remembers the "world-formula" and calculates with it to create the [[Doomsday Clock]], which can be currently found at [[The Narzissenkreuz Ordo]], the place with the same name where the Ordo gathered. The Doomsday Clock tells the time of when the "[[prophecy|apocalypse]]" will come to [[Teyvat]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Riddles Awaiting Answers}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Rene is likely to be inspired by {{w|René Descartes}}, a French philosopher, scientist, and mathematician.
* Rene is also likely to be inspired by {{w|René Iché}}, a French sculptor who was a very good friend of {{w|Max Jacob}} a French symbolism and surrealist painter.
** René Iché once quoted: "On the manure of the Millennia after geological cataclysms and warlike disasters, only the statues will remain."
* Rene named the [[Scarlet Quartz]]<ref name="Page5" /> and the [[Riftwolf|Rifthound]]<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (III)}}</ref> species.
* In [[Mary-Ann]]'s [[Annapausis#Features|story]], there is a mentioned character from the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team named Ney, whose name is derived from Rene.

===Etymology===
* Rene, or {{w|René}}, is a French masculine name derived from the Latin ''renātus'', meaning "reborn."
** The meaning of the name ties with how Rene was "reborn" as the Narzissenkreuz.
