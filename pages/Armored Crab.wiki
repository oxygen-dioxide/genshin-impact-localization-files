==Abilities==
Even while aggravated, Armored Crabs will only harmlessly strafe around the player while occasionally raising their armored claw, which is purely visual and does not provide any defensive effects. Rapidly hitting them will cause a stun animation. They will also be instantly stunned by hitting them while their claw is raised.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A crab that makes its home in borrowed shells.<br>It seems not to have any of the aggressiveness possessed by many wild animals. Perhaps it is because animals who attack for purposes other than obtaining food possess some degree of territoriality, yet the territory of the Armored Crab is naught but the small home upon its back.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Armored Crab is the only Enemy in the Archive that is incapable of dealing damage.
* Engaging in combat with an Armored Crab will not restrict [[Gadget]]s or initiate a region's specific Combat Music.
* Like real-life crabs, Armored Crabs are attracted to light.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Meka Luminaire: Radiant Countryside}}</ref>
