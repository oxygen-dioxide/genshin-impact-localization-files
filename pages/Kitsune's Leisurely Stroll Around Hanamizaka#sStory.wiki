==Summary==
Yae Miko goes on a stroll around [[Hanamizaka]]. She walks until she reaches [[Yukio]]'s stall, where she chooses to purchase and eat a snack. She continues on her stroll until she reaches [[Tomoki]]'s stall, where she chooses to purchase either regular [[Milk]] or [[Dango Milk]]. She continues on her walk once again, when she stops in front of [[Yae Publishing House]] to greet the [[Traveler]]. She recommends a novel to them before continuing on her journey. Finally, a shrine maiden comes to greet her, notifying her that there is an urgent matter at hand. Yae Miko then stops her stroll to get to work.
