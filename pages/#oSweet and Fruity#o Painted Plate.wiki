|description    = A dinner plate with complex patterns on it. Such utensils have their usage originating in [[Liyue]], though the glazing process has been modified to match local methods, making it most hardy and durable indeed. The images do look quite complicated, but it in fact requires a lot less work than might first appear on account of the special drawing tools available.<br>Its pale golden color makes it less susceptible to corrosion, and people thus use it to hold fresh and dried fruit.
