==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Fariba:''' Welcome.
:{{DIcon}} What are you selling?
::'''Fariba:''' Well... I'm not familiar with every single product. Everything's displayed in the store for customers to check themselves.
::'''Fariba:''' And there are some daily necessities here...
::'''Fariba:''' Blankets, spatulas, umbrellas, glasses, stuff like that...
::{{DIcon}} How much is an umbrella?
::'''Fariba:''' Huh? There's no price tag on it?
::'''Fariba:''' Hmm, umbrella, umbrella...
::'''Fariba:''' *sigh* I can't remember the price.
::'''Fariba:''' Why don't you look for something else?
::{{DIcon}} ...Are you able to make any sales like that?
::'''Fariba:''' I seem to be doing... okay? I don't keep the books, so I'm not quite sure about this.
::'''Fariba:''' A few customers come to our shop every day, but none of them are regular.
::'''Fariba:''' A [[Dori|little girl]] often comes to the manager for business. That's the only familiar face I can remember.
::'''Fariba:''' But I don't know what goods she delivers...
::'''Fariba:''' The manager seems to be very respectful to her, but never displays what she's delivered to the store.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Fariba:''' Take care.
