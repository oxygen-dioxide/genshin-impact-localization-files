'''Fluorescent Fungi''' are a [[Local Specialty]] of [[Inazuma]] found in the wild on [[Tsurumi Island]].

==How to Obtain==
Fluorescent Fungi grow on the roots of trees on [[Tsurumi Island]], most often in pairs.

*Before the completion of the [[World Quest]] series [[Through the Mists]], the player will get lost in the fog and teleported away. In order to gain access to the areas of the island where they grow, do the following:
*#Start [[A Particularly Particular Author]], the first quest of the [[Through the Mists]] World Quest series.
*#Continue the quest until the player travels with [[Kama]] to Tsurumi Island.

{{Description|A mushroom that glows like a night-light. Some curious power lies hidden within it. Amidst the fog that blankets Tsurumi Island, these Fluorescent Fungi can help to light the way.}}

==Trivia==
* Fluorescent Fungi are used in the world quest [[The Saga of Mr. Forgetful]]. In the quest, [[Roald]] the adventurer, who has a notoriously terrible memory, is trying to obtain some Fluorescent Fungi to improve his memory and visual acuity. Though Roald doesn't notice any improvement in his memory in the short term, he does admit that the mushrooms taste good.
* In real life, there are over 100 known fungi species that exhibit bioluminescence, with many having bioluminescent mushrooms, and some of them (certain ''{{w|Armillaria}}'' species) being edible like Fluorescent Fungi. See {{w|List of bioluminescent fungus species}}.
