==Profile==
Sun Yu and Little Que'er grew up together, training in martial arts since childhood. Sun Yu describes themselves as "form and shadow," and cares deeply for her &mdash; as a sister, that is. For her part, Que'er has evidently grown romantically interested in him, a fact she can't communicate to Sun Yu for various reasons... among them being her extremely aggressive and hostile tone towards anyone who even so much as looks his way.

Eventually, Sun Yu decides to leave Liyue to look for other ways to revive the Guhua Clan, much to Little Que'er's shock. He asks her to go with him, though she refuses, and his mind is eventually set to leave. This puts Little Que'er into a deep depression, as she mistakenly believes that he never cared for her in the first place.

:'''Little Que'er:''' Who are you? Do I know you?
:{{DIcon}} You are...?
::'''Little Que'er:''' Who I am is none of your business! You... I'll bet you're a monster from the mountains disguised as a person to try and trick the two of us!
:{{DIcon}} I... I...
::'''Little Que'er:''' "I"? "I"!? Cat got your tongue? Oh, I knew you were bad news!
::'''Little Que'er:''' You're just lucky my senior is here, otherwise I'd slice you open and give your soul an out-of-body experience otherwise!
::{{DIcon}} Senior...?
::'''Little Que'er:''' MY senior. MINE! Who are YOU calling senior!?
::'''Little Que'er:''' We have come here to seek guidance from the adeptus on how to revive the Guhua Clan. I'm warning you, do not get in our way!
::'''Little Que'er:''' And more importantly, keep your filthy hands off my senior!
::{{DIcon}} What's the Guhua Clan?
::'''Little Que'er:''' Guhua Clan? What about the Guhua Clan?
::'''Little Que'er:''' Hmph... My senior is the same, Guhua this, Guhua that... All he ever thinks about is the Guhua Clan.
::'''Little Que'er:''' Without seeming to notice that barely anyone else apart from us still associates themselves with that archonforsaken martial arts club...
::'''Little Que'er:''' If he could show even a fraction of the same affection he has for Guhua to me, maybe...
:{{DIcon}} ...Bye.
::'''Little Que'er:''' Yeah, that's right! Stop distracting us already!
