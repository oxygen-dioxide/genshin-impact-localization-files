{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Angelique:''' Why aren't there any new detective novels...
:{{DIcon}} Detective novels?
::'''Angelique:''' The "Great Detective Hurlock," "The Case Files of Miss Orith"... Many of these famed tales of detectives and deductions come from Fontaine. Even if you haven't read them, surely you've heard their names?
::'''Angelique:''' I've never refused to read a single one of these suspenseful tomes, and yet their serialization speed can never match my reading, so I always have to wait a long time between releases...
:{{DIcon}} You love reading, huh?
::'''Angelique:''' Of course I do. In fact, I have my own criteria for good and bad books.
::'''Angelique:''' For example, I prefer our local creative style. I mean, Inazuman light novels do feature detectives and reasoning too, but they all seem to have some sort of inexplicable sentimentality...
::'''Angelique:''' The cases themselves are plenty to look at, so why must they add all this romance? I'm here for a complete and clear chain of logic. I didn't sign up to read some sappy romance story...
::{{DIcon}} You do have a point.
:::'''Angelique:''' Hah, it seems we'll make good friends in this case.
:::'''Angelique:''' To be honest, I recently made a pen pal, and we've got a good thing going. He hinted that he'd like to meet me at [[Hotel Debord]]. I've been wondering if I should agree.
:::'''Angelique:''' Staying pen pals would be the safe decision, of course. I mean, if we were to meet, and sparks were to fly, how could I still call myself "rational above all"?
::{{DIcon}} I have my reservations about that.
:::'''Angelique:''' Ah, so it would seem that we're opposed on this issue.
:::'''Angelique:''' That's alright. Aesthetics are subjective in the end, and I don't intend to persuade you. May we each be equally nourished by the bounty of this land.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Angelique:''' See you. I need to re-read some old books, I think.
