The '''Sabzeruz Festival''' is a festival in [[Sumeru]] that commemorates the birth of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Windblume Research Report}}</ref> The festival is named after the deceased [[Goddess of Flowers]],<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Philby}}</ref> who had initially conceived of the celebration to celebrate the birthday of her friend, the previous [[Dendro]] [[Archon]] [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]. After Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, the festival became a celebration of Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday, which is considered to be the day that the sages found her.<ref name="trail">{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref> It is unclear if this is the same as [[Nahida]]'s birthday on her profile, October 27.

==Overview==
According to legend, a celebratory banquet was once thrown for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthday by her friends. Some of the gods at the banquet got drunk, one started playing music, and Rukkhadevata started singing. In response, the Goddess of Flowers began to dance, with [[Padisarah]]s blooming wherever she stepped. This banquet is said to be the origin of the Sabzeruz Festival.<ref name="trail"/>

The Sabzeruz Festival has many traditions associated with it, including the Haft-Mewa Feast, where people set their tables with seven different foods, and Farris, the Knight of Flowers, a figure popular among children that an actor plays during the festival. The most important part of the festival is the Dance of Sabzeruz, which is based on the Goddess of Flowers' dance.<ref name="coming">{{Ref/Quest|The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival}}</ref>

Since the death of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, the higher-ups at [[Sumeru Akademiya]] have stopped organizing the festival,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Nizam}}</ref> which [[Dunyarzad]] speculates to be because they see Lesser Lord Kusanali's birth as a symbol of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death. The Akademiya heavily marginalizes the festival, refusing to fund it and treating it almost as if it doesn't exist.<ref name="trail"/> In recent times they have been willing to shut down the performance of the Dance of Sabzeruz, the festival's most important event, altogether.<ref name="coming"/>

==Trivia==
* Sabzeruz appears to be inspired by the Iranian new year of {{w|Nowruz}} which begins on the spring equinox. It is celebrated worldwide by various ethno-linguistic groups, and falls on or around March 21 of the Gregorian calendar.
* Haft-mewa has a real-world equivalent of the same name, which is a compote of seven types of dried fruits and nuts traditionally eaten by the Afghan people during Nowruz. The seven components each represent one of the [https://www.196flavors.com/haft-mewa/ seven elements of life], which are fire, earth, water, air, plants, animals and people.
** The Persian equivalent is {{w|Haft-sin}}, an arrangement of seven symbolic items, each of which represents a traditional value.

===Etymology===
* {{Lang|fa=سبزه روز|"Sabzeruz"}} is derived from the Persian words ''sabze'' ({{Lang|mini=1|fa=سبزه|fa_tl=grass, greens}}) and ''ruz'' ({{Lang|mini=1|fa=روز|fa_tl=day}}), together meaning "Day of Grass," an appropriate name for the Dendro region of Sumeru.
** ''Sabze'' is one of the seven items of the Haft-sin prepared for Nowruz, and is said to symbolize rebirth and growth.
* In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the festival is called "Birthday (Festival) of the Goddess of Flowers."
