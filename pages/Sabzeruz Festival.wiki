The '''Sabzeruz Festival''' is a festival in [[Sumeru]] that commemorates the birth of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Windblume Research Report}}</ref> It is mentioned in passing by [[Sayid]] during the [[Windblume Festival]].

Little is known so far about the Sabzeruz Festival, and Sayid says that the atmosphere during the festival is somewhat different from the Windblume Festival's.

==Trivia==
*Sabzeruz appears to be inspired by the Iranian new year of {{w|Nowruz}} which begins on the spring equinox. It is celebrated worldwide by various ethno-linguistic groups, and falls on or around March 21 of the Gregorian calendar.

===Etymology===
*{{Lang|fa=سبزه روز|"Sabzeruz"}} is derived from the Persian words ''sabze'' ({{Lang|mini=1|fa=سبزه|fa_tl=grass, greens}}) and ''ruz'' ({{Lang|mini=1|fa=روز|fa_tl=day}}), together meaning "Day of Grass," an appropriate name for the Dendro region of Sumeru.
**''Sabze'' is one of the seven items of the {{w|Haft-sin}} prepared for Nowruz, and is said to symbolize rebirth and growth.
*In Chinese and Korean, the festival is called {{Lang|"the Flower Archon/God's birthday|zh=花神诞日|ko=화신(花神) {{tt|탄신일|誕辰日}}}}.
**In Japanese, it is called {{Lang|"the Flower Archon/God festival"|ja=花神祭り}}.
**Note: The suffix "神" in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean is translated into English as either "Archon" or "God" when referring to The Seven. Because this term has not been used in the official English translation, either translation is possible.
