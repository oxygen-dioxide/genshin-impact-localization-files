==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pele Nui:''' Time to sort through the photos... Oh, and to get some more film.
:{{DIcon}} Do you like taking photos?
::'''Pele Nui:''' I like it a lot! Compared to scenery, though, I prefer taking pictures of people.
::'''Pele Nui:''' I've shot a lot of family photos, enough to make several big albums. Out of my family members, my niece [[Haloa Nui|Haloa]] humors me the most &mdash; you can see her in nearly all the photos.
::'''Pele Nui:''' Oh, and I also like getting pictures with famous people. I've asked for a picture with every hero and warrior who's come here for a dip.
;;(After completing Step 2 of ''[[Home of the Hot Springs]]'')
::{{DIcon}} Then you must know [[Atea]], then?
:::'''Pele Nui:''' Atea... Ah, if I'm not mistaken, you must be [[Mualani]]'s friend, right?
:::'''Pele Nui:''' Atea's mentioned you to me before. Thank you so much for helping everyone at our tribe.
:::'''Pele Nui:''' Ah, Atea... She said that she knew her day would come. She even told us to not be too sad on her behalf...
:::'''Pele Nui:''' Speaking of Atea, I once took a picture of her with [[Mavuika|our Archon]]! They looked super cool together.
:::'''Pele Nui:''' I don't have it on me, though, so I guess I should go dig it out and show it to everyone.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Pele Nui:''' See ya.
