{{Dialogue Start}}
::...The energy cores have stopped working. The cause is an inherent mechanical design defect that causes the occasional operation overload...
::Suggested solution: Due to the lack of spare parts and the difficulty of producing more, maintenance is incomplete. It can only be operated at full power for a short while. Shutdown is recommended each time the chronometer completes one rotation...
::&ZeroWidthSpace;
::...The weapons systems have melted down due to overuse...
::Suggested solution: Strip destroyed machinery for related parts, then reassemble for use. Testing indicates that this should basically be able to fulfill the requirements of high-intensity combat...
::&ZeroWidthSpace;
::... Smart boot system failed, cause unknown. Many components have taken on sand or have disintegrated. The mobility system has not been completely disabled, but the ability to walk long distances has been lost...
::Suggested solution: [[Ruin Golem (Valley of Dahri)|This machine]] was lost in the [[Valley of Dahri|southern desert]]. We lack the means to tow this machine. Thus, it can only standby and await retrieval...
