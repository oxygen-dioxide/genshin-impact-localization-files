...The energy cores have stopped working. The cause is an inherent mechanical design defect that causes the occasional operation overload...<br />
Suggested solution: Due to the lack of spare parts and the difficulty of producing more, maintenance is incomplete. It can only be operated at full power for a short while. Shutdown is recommended each time the chronometer completes one rotation...

...The weapons systems have melted down due to overuse...<br />
Suggested solution: Strip destroyed machinery for related parts, then reassemble for use. Testing indicates that this should basically be able to fulfill the requirements of high-intensity combat...

Suggested solution: This machine was lost in the southern desert. We lack the means to tow this machine. Thus, it can only standby and await retrieval...

"A page from the research notes, but it seems to have been torn off and hidden here by the author"

...Collected a lot of components, these spare parts of the huge machine, if only I could figure out its working principle and manufacturing process...

...Fiddling with these components almost caused a delay in my work. These exquisite mechanical parts have a unique and ingenious style, which is not likely to be found in the handcrafted artifacts under the rule of [[Archon]]s. I am going to take them apart, and record the size and shape one by one...

...But first of all, this secret must not be revealed to the other team members...
