==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Amazolli:''' Hello there, and welcome to [[Idukan's Trove]].
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to browse your wares...
::'''Amazolli:''' Just as you only know what's delicious after you've eaten much, you only know your books after you've read broadly!
:{{DIcon}} So, tell me about this "Trove"...
::'''Amazolli:''' "Idukan"... It's a good name.
::'''Amazolli:''' I read it in a book of legends, but the details of the content escape me nowadays... Still, I recall that its own owner was a figure of much wisdom.
::'''Amazolli:''' Wisdom comes in many forms. Printed on paper, woven upon cloth, and even spread by word of mouth.
::'''Amazolli:''' And that's why I named my store after them.
::{{DIcon}} Names are very important.
::'''Amazolli:''' Indeed!
::'''Amazolli:''' The great [[Tlapo|Iktomisaur elder]]'s full name means "He of the Sharp Mist-Shaded Claws," while mine, "Amazolli," means "Ancient Collection of Texts."
::'''Amazolli:''' So, here I am, running a bookstore.
::'''Amazolli:''' Just as shamans can gain a glimpse into fate in their dreams, all things have a trail you can follow.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Amazolli:''' See you. May wisdom keep you from the wrong paths.
