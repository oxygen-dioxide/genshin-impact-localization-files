==Announcement Details==
Hello Travelers~ After joining the Razer Gold and Silver platforms in December 2020, miHoYo and Razer are excited to announce their brand-new collaboration!

To celebrate this monumentous event, miHoYo and Razer have teamed up to develop co-branded gaming gear as well as product support services such as custom THX in-game profiles to further help players enhance their immersion in the fantastical world of Teyvat.

This month, Travelers can look forward to scoring Genshin Impact-edition Razer products such as: Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro Ergonomic Wireless Gaming Mouse, the Razer Iskur X Ergonomic Gaming Chair, and the Razer Goliathus Speed Soft Gaming Mouse Mat - Medium.

To commemorate this event, each co-branded product will come with a gift code, which can be redeemed for bonus in-game rewards! Don't miss it, Travelers~

To further enhance gaming immersion, Razer also offers THX gaming profiles that can be customized and adjusted via the THX Spatial Audio application. This profile is available on PC and compatible with all gaming headsets for Genshin Impact. The THX Spatial Audio app is designed to deliver high-quality 7.1 surround sound with precise positioning accuracy, and enables realistic acoustics that clearly reflect the in-game environment. We believe that this feature can help Travelers experience a more immersive and seamless gaming experience when facing tough challenges in the game.
