{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Moce:''' Stay on your guard, citizen!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Moce:''' Me? As you can see, I'm busy dealing with the barbarian threat! According to the reports I've received, there've been traces of them skulking about here.
::'''Moce:''' This is no trivial matter! Vigilance must be maintained until reinforcements arrive!
::'''Moce:''' If there is anything else, please bring it up with my adjutant, citizen.
:{{DIcon}} A child, out here on their own...
::'''Moce:''' Hmm? A child? Where from? Did some new legionnaire disobey orders and bring their family into the camp again...?
::'''Moce:''' *sigh* Dominus [[Cassiodor]] is far too gentle with these greenhorns. If this were to have happened three decades prior, a Tribunus would've had a whip out by now...
:{{DIcon}} Have there been any suspicious happenings lately?
::'''Moce:''' Not at present. that said, the barbarians are akin to cunning beasts. Ever will they strike when your guard has been lowered, for surprise is their greatest weapon!
::'''Moce:''' By methods most foul they infiltrate our cities and seek out our secrets. Even the slightest lapse in discipline may lead to catastrophe.
::'''Moce:''' *sigh* Thirty years ago, when I followed Dominus Boethius to conquest in the far north, they were but a pack of primitives without any such skill for subterfuge. Where did they learn these tricks?
::{{DIcon}} Thirty years ago... Your parents wouldn't even have been born yet...
::'''Moce:''' Hmm? What did you just say, citizen? I fear my hearing's been going as I age.
::'''Moce:''' *sigh* Time truly is cruel. During the conquest of Bituria, I could hear the barbarians' bells calling them to muster from miles away.
:{{DIcon}} Farewell.
::'''Moce:''' Fare ye well, citizen! You may report suspicious people to me at any time!

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Moce:''' Ugh, this is soooo boring. My dream was more interesting than life here. I wanna go see the outside world!
:{{DIcon}} What sort of dream would be that interesting?
::'''Moce:''' A very, very long one! Uh, I don't really remember much of it anymore, though. Did I have it yesterday? Or have I had it before...
::'''Moce:''' I dreamed that the town was invaded, and I joined up with the Gardes, becoming an awesome officer - even my dad had to listen to me!
::'''Moce:''' I would say, "Giovanni, bring me my gun," and he could only say, "Sir, yes, sir!" 
::'''Moce:''' In the past, when I would dream, I would wake up once I realized that something didn't add up. But that dream was perfect. I was so happy, I could've played in there forever. 
::'''Moce:''' I guess it's because of my recent desire to go out on an adventure. 
:{{DIcon}} Is Petrichor that boring?
::'''Moce:''' Exactly! Nothing ever changes around here, and everyone's okay with that... If it wasn't like this, Uncle would never have left!
::'''Moce:''' I wanted to go see the outside world... I heard people in town say that Sumeru's an interesting place, with its rainforests and deserts... and ancient fortresses and temples! 
::'''Moce:''' Here, it's all water everywhere you look... Ah, how I wish I could go on an adventure! 
::{{DIcon}} Your uncle?
:;(If {{Quest|Latecoming Homecoming}} has not been completed)
:::'''Moce:''' That's right. I don't know his name, and he's never written us any letters... Dad always calls him "that blockhead," or "that guy"...
:::'''Moce:''' But he's gotta be a pretty awesome guy to have bucked with tradition and left town by himself to Sumeru! Better than Dad, who only ever talks about family and duty and stuff like that...
:::'''Moce:''' Uh, hmm. Did I say too much? Keep that stuff a secret and don't tell Dad, alright? Thanks!
:;(If Latecoming Homecoming has been completed)
:::'''Moce:''' That's right! My uncle was in Sumeru before, but he came back in the last couple of days.
:::'''Moce:''' Dad says that Uncle didn't get anything done other than get himself into a bunch of debt before returning, but I bet that's a lie.
:::'''Moce:''' He just said that because he doesn't want me to leave town!
:{{DIcon}} The outside world isn't that interesting either. 
::'''Moce:''' Eh? Wouldn't you have had to see every kind of other place before you can say that?
