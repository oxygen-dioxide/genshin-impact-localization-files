</gallery>
* Chest weak point is only exposed during '''Missile Barrage'''.
* Thruster weak points are only exposed while airborne and intact.
* Head weak point is only exposed during '''Confetti''', '''Grounded Charge''', and '''Airborne Charge'''.

==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Confetti
|desc_1      = Charges before scattering a great number of bombs into the air, dealing '''100% ATK''' when they land as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}} or {{Color|AoE Elemental DMG}} matching the Aeonblight Drake's currently absorbed element.
* After this attack, the Aeonblight Drake will absorb the element that it has received the most amount of DMG from since the beginning of the battle or the last time it performed this attack. If it has received more Physical DMG than any other Elemental DMG, it will not absorb an element.
* The absorbed element will be used the next time it performs this attack. It also gains '''60%''' [[Resistance]] to the absorbed element.
* If the Aeonblight Drake has not received any Elemental DMG the beginning of the battle or the last time it performed this attack, or if it has received more Physical DMG than any other Elemental DMG, it will stay in or return to its Physical state.
* After the absorption is complete, the Aeonblight Drake will change states.
** If it changes from Airborne to Grounded, it will also deal '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}} where it lands.

Paralyzing the Ruin Drake will also remove its absorbed element.
