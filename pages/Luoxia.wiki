==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Luoxia:''' Welcome to the Pearl Galley. I believe that I have the honor of addressing the rumored Traveler, yes?
:'''Luoxia:''' I wonder, whose invitation are you here on?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Luoxia:''' This is the Pearl Galley, where you can forget all your worries and troubles...
::'''Luoxia:''' Do not be alarmed. Everything that happens here has the tacit approval of the [[Liyue Qixing]].
::'''Luoxia:''' As long as you are here, you can enjoy to your heart's content... *giggles*
:{{DIcon}} Who might you be?
::'''Luoxia:''' This one's humble name is Luoxia. I handle... many things onboard this ship. But do not misunderstand. I am not the master here.
::'''Luoxia:''' Our boss is Rouran. There are very, very few who have the privilege of meeting the boss...
::'''Luoxia:''' If I may say one more thing... If you do indeed meet our boss, do be mindful of your actions.
::'''Luoxia:''' Our boss may seem like a delicate flower, but you will find few thorns to match in all of Liyue Harbor.
::'''Luoxia:''' I will say no more, but do bear what I have said in mind.
:{{DIcon}} I'll be taking my leave.
::'''Luoxia:''' As you please... and may you be happy.
