:'''Roca:''' Now that was a great warm-up! Most praiseworthy.
:'''Humboldt:''' ...But...?
:'''Roca:''' But I still have a problem with the muscle groups that are used for rock climbing.
:'''Humboldt:''' Hahaha, I knew it...
:'''Roca:''' Don't give up just yet! Let me finish.
:'''Roca:''' You can't only use your arms just because your legs are a bit uncoordinated. How can you put extra pressure on something that was already lacking in the first place?
:'''Roca:''' We're going to focus on training your arms next. Understood?
:'''Humboldt:''' Okay... understood!
:'''Humboldt:''' ...Wait, didn't I come here to sightsee? How did I get roped into a fitness class?
:'''Roca:''' All the tourist attractions in [[Natlan]] are kind of like this. You'll get used to it.
:'''Humboldt:''' I see... Guess I'll take your word for it?
