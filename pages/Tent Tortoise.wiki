|description = A reptile with a thick carapace.<br>A gentle-tempered, slow-moving species. Because of its longevity, it is deemed by some people as a symbol of auspiciousness and wisdom. Due to its excessively gentle temper and slow motion, it is also used as a metaphor to insult people. Whatever the case, the Tent Tortoise is content to peacefully walk the lands. Human languages bear no meaningful connotations whatsoever to such a creature.
