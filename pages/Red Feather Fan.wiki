==Descriptions==
{{Description|This item possesses some sort of mysterious power. In the hands of the [[tengu]] warriors, it can have various effects, but in the hands of an ordinary person, it can still have enough power to "make one's body lighter" while in mid air.<br />Legend has it that the first successor of the [[Iwakura Clan|Iwakura Art]] had and agreement with a Yougou tengu warrior to have an annual duel. This being the time before the secret blade techniques of the Iwakura were created, his sword could not touch the tengu, who could use the power of free flight grandted to its race. Rather than duels, these could be better described as pranking sessions, courtesy of the tengu.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* This item's appearance and utility are inspired by the magical feather fans that are used by {{w|Tengu}} in Japanese folklore, which allow them to stir up great winds.
