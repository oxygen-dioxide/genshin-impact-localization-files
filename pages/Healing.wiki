'''Healing''' refers to the ability to regenerate Health. This can be done via [[Food]], Character Talents, or special Domain effects.

Some Healing abilities apply team-wide, others only to the individual. Some Healing abilities are local, requiring players to be within a certain field of area to be healed, while others are more global, applying the healing to the player (and other players in [[Co-Op Mode]]) wherever they are on or off the battlefield.

[[Hydro]] [[Resonance]] increases incoming healing, as well as various artifacts.

==Healing Comparison==
Healing abilities can be divided into the following categories:

*'''Local:''' Characters will have to be within a certain radius to receive healing effects.
*'''Global:''' All players within the [[party]], including other players in [[Co-Op Mode]], will receive healing regardless of their location.
*'''Individual:''' Only one character will receive the healing effect per ability activation.
*'''Teamwide:''' Various members of the team (including in Co-Op Mode) can receive the healing effect at once.

Terminology used in the table below:

*Under the Character column:
**Skill means [[Elemental Skill]].
** Burst means [[Elemental Burst]].
** AA means [[Normal Attack]] (auto-attack).
** CA means [[Charged Attack]].
**C followed by a number means a [[Constellation]] level.
**Passive refers to Passive Talents. Passive 1 is the one gained at Ascension 1, while Passive 2 is the one gained at Ascension 4.
*Under the Individual column:
**Fielder refers to your active character on the field; it does not have to be the ability's caster.
**Self means that only the skill's caster receives healing.<!-- Maybe dpl this later, keeping visual table for now -->
