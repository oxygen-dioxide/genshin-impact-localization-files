'''Realm Music''' is a subsystem in the [[Serenitea Pot]] that allows players to customize the ambient music of the current [[Realm Layout]]. It is accessed by interacting with [[#Euphonium Unbound|Euphonium Unbound]] furnishings and makes use of [[Radiant Spincrystal]]s to unlock more options.

==Default Soundtracks==
Like most open-world locations, each Realm Layout and Realm Mansion has its own set of default soundtracks that play if Realm Music has not been customized.
