{{Description|A monster born from highly-concentrated elements that can float in the air.<br>On the whole, they are little sprites that have a gentle temperament, much like [[Slimes]], but they can sometimes explode into a rage.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

'''Specters''' are [[Common Enemies]] found in [[Inazuma]], [[Enkanomiya]], and [[Sumeru]].

Specters are immune to their own element. In combat, they are capable of floating and have a [[Fury]] meter that fills up when they take high DMG from a single hit. When the Fury meter is full, they will enter an enraged state where they grow larger and gain enhanced attacks. When defeated, Specters will also charge up briefly before exploding, dealing AoE DMG.

==Trivia==
*Specters do not trigger the passive effects of various talents or weapons that require the player to kill an enemy. For example, the ATK% boost from the [[Blackcliff Series]] is not granted upon killing a specter.<ref>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/combat-mechanics/enemy-mechanics/enemy-interactions#specter-defeat-interaction Specter Defeat Interaction]</ref>
*Specters are considered pests on [[Watatsumi Island]], as [[Kokomi]] has a Specter Eco-Management group.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref>
