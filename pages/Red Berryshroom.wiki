{{Description|An ordinary-looking mushroom with an extraordinary flavor. Only grows near the orchard at [[Varesa]]'s house. Since [[Paimon]] gave it a cute name, its taste must have been truly memorable for her. It has a fruity flavor when eaten raw, but exposing it to heat brings out a rich, mushroomy aroma, making it the perfect pairing for a slightly fatty steak. The chefs of the Collective of Plenty are planning to promote this mushroom through an event known as the "Epic Feast Showdown."|[[Archive]]}}
