'''Duel Soul''' is a [[Special Dish]] that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Tahchin]] with [[Cyno]]. The [[recipe]] for Tahchin is the reward for [[Sumeru]] [[Reputation]] level 4.

Duel Soul restores 34% of the Max [[HP]] and regenerates 980 HP every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* The appearance and description of this food item likely reference the popular trading card game {{w|Yu-Gi-Oh!}}. The food resembles the Millennium Puzzle, and the description is a reference to the tendency for their players to passionately duel each other. These tie in with many other Yu-Go-Oh! references surrounding Cyno (see {{S|Cyno/Lore#Trivia}}).
