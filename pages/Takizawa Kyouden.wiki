'''Takizawa Kyouden''' was a famous author in [[Inazuma]]. "[[Toki Alley Tales]]" is one of his notable works.

He is mentioned in several bulletin boards in Inazuma, as [[Hiratsuka]] of the [[Yae Publishing House]] lost the only extant copy of "Toki Alley Tales" and [[Yae Miko]] bid her to put up lost book notices.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Hanamizaka Bulletin Board|Hiratsuka's Message}}</ref> The [[Traveler]] can find the torn pages of the book scattered across the archipelago.

[[Sumida]] begins talking about Kyouden at one point, starting about how he was 33 years old when he read a certain work, but is interrupted by [[Ryuuji]] before she can continue.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Octave of the Maushiro}}</ref>
