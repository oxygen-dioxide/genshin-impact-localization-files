|description    = An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br>A grimalkin with emerald-green eyes, they walk upon roof beams at night with great grace. Its furry footsteps are nearly inaudible and it often sneaks into shops and kitchens undetected.<br>Luckily, since they needn't worry about food or drink here, they've become much more honest after arriving in the Realm Within.
