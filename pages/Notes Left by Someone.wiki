...After scouring the land for days, I have finally found the [[Korybantes]]. Alas, I lack the strength to retrieve them. As such, I will record their locations here...

...There is no detailed information on the key contents of the ritual. I have drawn the following inferences from a comprehensive review of the current body of research:<br>
Firstly, the element of the Korybantes matches the element recorded on the drum score.<br>
This is obvious, and requires only a rudimentary understanding.<br>
Anemo and Geo Drums do not exist. The reason for this merits further investigation.<br>
Secondly, the meaning behind the notation.<br>
Notation may be divided into three categories: empty, half-full, full. The hypothesis is that the musical notes refer to three types of rhythms, namely: pause, light, and heavy.<br>
Thirdly, the order of reading.<br>
Unable to be determined. If a lost Kory Drum is found, one can try to read it in the usual order, which is from left to right and top to bottom.
