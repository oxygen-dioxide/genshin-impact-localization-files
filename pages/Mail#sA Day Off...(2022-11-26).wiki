|text    = I was given a day off this morning... Everyone encouraged me to walk out of the lab and enjoy a memorable birthday.

Yet somehow, I feel at a loss leaving my experiment
behind. What should I do?

Stroll around [[Windrise]] or fish by [[Cider Lake]]? I can't think of anything else other than these simple pastimes. To be honest, coming up with these ideas already proved more challenging than lab result analysis...

In the end, [[Jean]] reminded me that I can make a list of things I want to do and check them one by one.

I want to collect various peculiar bones to research on!

Although everyone's probably used to it... I'm still a bit shy to make the request: Would you mind joining me if it's not too much trouble?
