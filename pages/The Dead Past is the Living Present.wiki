:{{Color|menu|In the great hall, people gather around the coffin to pay their respects. The atmosphere is solemn.}}
:{{Black Screen|You, Sethos, and the other members of the Temple bid farewell to Bamoun.}}
:{{Black Screen|In the great hall, people gather around the coffin to pay their respects. The atmosphere is solemn.}}
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 02.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' ...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Sethos... You'll get through this.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 03.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' I know, I just... I'll miss him.
:{{DIcon}} I am so sorry for your loss.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I guess you were prepared for this. It's been a long time coming, huh?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 04.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' Yeah. He's been on death's door for a very long time now. I think it was only through sheer willpower that he managed to hold on to this point.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 05.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' ...At least he was able to see this chapter come to a close before he passed.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's next for you?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 06.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' Per my grandfather's last wishes, the Temple of Silence should submit to whoever possesses the largest number of Hermanubis fragments. That entitles you to be our new leader, Cyno.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But that's never going to work, as I'm sure you realize. I'm the General Mahamatra. I am needed back at the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I did foresee this possibility, and I gave it some thought. The fact is, I know next to nothing about the staff, records, and environment here. As such, I am ill-suited to be your leader.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Sethos, I believe the honor should go to you.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Were it not for this duel, or indeed if you had other intentions... The Ba Fragments would most likely be in your hands by now. I'm sure Bamoun never meant for anyone but you to be his successor.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 07.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' You really think so?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I do.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Still, I didn't think Bamoun looked very surprised by the final result. Perhaps he had an inkling that this would be the way things end.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Well, in any case, since the Ba Fragments are with me now, I guess I can call the shots.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Sethos, I would like you to succeed Bamoun as the new leader of the Temple of Silence. You are more suited to the role than I, and I have complete faith that you will be an excellent leader. Just think of it as doing me a favor.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 08.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' But doesn't that render everything that we've been through up to now meaningless?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' No, it doesn't. This experience has allowed us to become friends, which means that the Akademiya and the Temple of Silence will become partners once more.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That's a much bigger deal than you might think, Sethos. You said yourself, times have changed. You have to believe that things can change for the better here at the Temple, too.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 09.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' ...I will try. To be honest, I couldn't have asked for a better outcome.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Actually, part of me wonders whether Bamoun's intention from the very beginning was just to create enough pressure to force us towards a duel.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That way, no matter who won, one of us would have to surrender our Ba Fragment, and the power of Hermanubis would be concentrated in one single person.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Had you won, the Temple of Silence would have doubled its strength.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' And were I to win, he correctly anticipated that I wouldn't suddenly drop everything to become the leader of the Temple, much less integrate the Temple into the Akademiya by force.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' He knew that the Temple's future would depend not just on the guidance of Hermanubis, but the support of the Akademiya too. So he made it his responsibility to ensure his successor would be free from the burdens of the past.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' His plan meant that whoever ended up succeeding him, they would have an easier time interacting with the Akademiya. With one single letter, he lured out the Professor... No matter what happened after that, it would result in a net benefit to the Temple.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 10.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' ...And here I thought the General Mahamatra wouldn't care for all these trivial details.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 11.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' You're absolutely right. Grandfather and I considered this from every angle. We had to find a way to mend our relationship with the Akademiya... In that sense, the Rite of Duels was just a means to an end.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 12.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' Thank you for everything, Cyno. As a gesture of our gratitude, to those that you and Lesser Lord Kusanali deem worthy, I will grant the honor of access to the Temple of Silence for their pursuit of knowledge.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 13.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' The Temple of Silence has a wealth of information on King Deshret's civilization, more than any other organization in existence today. In times when you need information that only we can provide, we will be here to support you.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 14.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' But you must be exceedingly careful with your selection of candidates, lest you lead humanity to repeat the same mistakes.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 15.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' By the way, Tighnari, my grandfather was so happy to see you. You are a descendant of the Valuka Shuna, and we are the heirs to the will of Hermanubis.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 16.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' The story goes that King Deshret chose the sage Hermanubis from among the [[Tighnarians]], and appointed him as his familiar.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 17.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' He went on to fight many valiant battles with his Tighnarian companions. They always stood by each other, from the founding of the Temple of Silence to the fall of Tulaytullah.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 18.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' The Tighnarians who left Tulaytullah joined their human counterparts in the rainforest. A few centuries later, when some of the group returned to the desert, many of the Tighnarians chose to stay, and put down roots in the rainforest.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 19.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' In all likelihood, those were your ancestors.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' How fascinating... My father once mentioned that I was named after the Tighnarians, but I never knew that my forbearers had such a history with the Temple of Silence.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I like this story.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, has anyone seen Cyrus?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 20.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' Ah yes, Cyrus... You'll probably find him in my grandfather's room. He wouldn't show it in front of me, but I think he still has many fond memories of my grandfather.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' If it's true that you and your grandfather really planned for everything to turn out this way, then I guess he didn't really resent Cyrus as much as he appeared to.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 21.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' Heh, who knows? Perhaps all of us &mdash; you, me, and Cyrus &mdash; were all just pawns in my grandfather's plan to set things straight. He was awful like that.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 17.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Someone's got to make the decisions when history is at a crossroads.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 18.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I will make a detailed report on all of this to Lesser Lord Kusanali, and arrange for an official delegation from the Akademiya to come and meet you in the desert.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 19.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'm sure you'll have lots to attend to in the days ahead. But once things return to normal, please come and visit the rainforest again. You should stay for a few days this time, and start to build some relationships.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 cyno 20.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If we're going to work together, both sides have to get to know one another better.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 22.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' I will.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 sethos 23.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' Alright, well... Bye for now, everyone. I'll be seeing you.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See you soon! Come hang out with us anytime!
:{{DIcon}} Best of luck to you, Sethos.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Sethos, optional)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 sethos 01.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' (Did you see, Grandfather? Cyno chose me to succeed you as leader of the Temple of Silence. I will now serve in his stead.)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 sethos 02.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' (It's still early days, and I can't say that I know him that well yet. But after that battle, I now understand why he came here with a whole group of friends.)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 sethos 03.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' (Companionship means to trust and be trusted. Just like Cyno and his friends, we too will fight side by side and support each other in times of trouble.)

;(Talk to Sethos, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 sethos 01.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' ...Grandfather, we did it. We achieved what we set out to do.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 sethos 02.ogg}} '''Sethos:''' From this day on, the Temple of Silence has the chance to work with the Akademiya once more. Real change, real opportunities... They are now within our grasp.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Cyrus, optional)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' (All these years, I've felt like I'm still young, I still have lots to look forward to in life.)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 spantamadcyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' (But now... I suddenly feel...)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 spantamadcyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' (I too have grown old, Bamoun, just like you.)

;(Talk to Cyrus, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...*sigh*
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 spantamadcyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' The people of the desert are stubborn folk, fiercely loyal to their heritage, even if it means suffering years of hardship and pain. You said this yourself.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 spantamadcyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' But why did you feel the need to go this far? You never were the fearsome leader you made yourself out to be, Bamoun.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 spantamadcyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 spantamadcyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Being stubborn and unyielding is bound to send you to an early grave. Haha...

;(Return to the Akademiya)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 nafis 01.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' What were you thinking, gallivanting off into the desert alone, at your age!? What if you'd kicked the bucket, hmm? You told not a soul what you were up to, designated nobody to handle your affairs, and left everyone scrambling frantically to try and figure out how on earth to clean up the colossal mess you'd made!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 spantamadcyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh please, will you stop your yelling! What other choice did I have?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 nafis 02.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' What do you mean, what other choice!? Do you mean to tell me that after all your years of learning &mdash; and sagehood, no less &mdash; the only idea you could conjure up in that white-haired walnut of yours was to shoot off into the unknown like some hot-headed 20-year-old adventurer?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 nafis 03.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' A one-man suicide mission, hmm? That's the best idea that one of the finest minds of a generation could come up with, is it? ...It astounds me that you survived the journey, and you're lucky that Bamoun didn't finish you off when you arrived!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 spantamadcyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Alright, alright! Honestly, the way you're going off on me, it's like you wished you'd been there to lend him a hand... Does it mean nothing to you that I am your colleague and former classmate?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 nafis 04.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Phew... *sigh* I've got nothing more to say. What's the point of berating an old bag of bones...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 spantamadcyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' What do you mean, bag of bones? I'm a flesh-and-blood hero who, despite his old age, saved our General Mahamatra from being stripped of his powers!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 spantamadcyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...Okay look... *sigh* Fine, I admit, I was in the wrong... How can I make it up to you? What about... a month's work at the Akademiya?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 nafis 05.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Hmph, one month? Try three!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tighnari's master is really laying into Cyrus... Uh, let's give them a wide berth...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, we're too young to get involved...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Professor brought this on himself. Don't pay any attention to him.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Wow, I haven't seen Master get this riled up in a long time.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' The last time he chewed someone out like this must have been back when I was still a student...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I think I'll go around and update everyone, tell them the situation's resolved. Want to come with me?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We can go for dinner afterwards, my treat. You in?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Makes sense. I'm in.
:{{DIcon}} Free food is free food...
:{{DIcon}} Always happy to help.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's coming too! Let's go!

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Cyrus, optional)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' (If Naphis thinks he's getting a single day of free labor from me, he's got another thing coming!)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Naphis, optional)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 nafis 01.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' (I should have asked him to come help out at work much earlier. That would have kept him out of trouble, and avoided this whole debacle...)

;(Talk to Cyrus or Naphis, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 nafis 01.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' You'd better start packing your things. Report for work first thing tomorrow morning &mdash; I'll be waiting for you.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 spantamadcyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' What about my allowance? Oh, and is lunch covered? How about dinner?
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 nafis 02.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Don't push your luck... Let's not forget who is compensating whom here.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq105 spantamadcyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hey, a man's got to eat! Help me figure out something for lunch at least? I'm counting on you.

;(Approach Collei and Faruzan)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hey, Collei!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah, you're back!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Huh? Well, look who we have here... Would you mind explaining to me what has been going on these past few days? I heard you all ran off into the desert and got embroiled in a major catastrophe?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' All taken care of.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That does NOT answer my question! How could you be so careless? That goes for you as well! Yes, and you two!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' When you run into problems, you really ought to ask for help, you know. I've been around the block, don't you think it would have made sense to involve me? And let's not forget, I know the desert like the back of my hand...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Now would not be a good time to attempt to argue with Faruzan.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You're right.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mhm!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' It's not the first time that I've had to talk to you about this sort of thing, either. You need to learn that there are times when the right thing to do is get a more experienced member of staff involved. Do I make myself clear? Because if you don't, I...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' (Collei, please do something!)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (...! He's giving me the signal! Alright, guess it's time to play my ace-in-the-hole...)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Um, say, Madame Faruzan, I can see you're pretty upset, but, uh, I was just wondering... Remember that time you offered to give me a tour of the Akademiya? Does that offer still stand?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 faruzan 05.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 faruzan 06.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Ah... Wait, did I hear that right? Collei, you remember? Wonderful! Well, of course the offer still stands! Come on, Madame Faruzan will show you around the old classrooms...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Poor Collei, getting dragged off like that... Also, check out Faruzan acting like some sort of official Akademiya tour guide...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Ahem, Collei! Cup!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Huh? What? ...O&mdash;Oh, right!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Hmm? What do you mean, "cup"? You need a cup? I can get you a cup.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, it's nothing, just Master's way of reminding me to stay hydrated while I'm out and about, hehe, heh...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's code for "let's reconvene at the cafe." Tighnari and I used it while we were in school, and it's become something of a family tradition now.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's kinda fun.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Mm-hmm.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 3 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Two people left. Let's bring them along too.

;(Approach Alhaitham and Kaveh)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Am I hallucinating? Or do I see Kaveh and Alhaitham engaged in diligent studying?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' We're just re-organizing all the books we used. Look, there's a whole mountain of them!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' There's no rush. Nobody reads these books anyway.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' My sincere thanks to you both.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes, with your help, we resolved the issue rather swiftly and painlessly. And the outcome was better than we could have hoped for.
:{{Black Screen|Cyno informs Alhaitham and Kaveh of everything that happened in the desert.}}
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I see. The Temple of Silence resorted to rather unique means of self-preservation. It explains how they managed to remain hidden for so many years.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' And it sounds like they managed to preserve a whole load of ancient documents as well... I'd love to go check those out if I ever had the chance.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That day will come. The Temple of Silence is a hugely important organization, and we'll be sure to maintain good relations with them in the future.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Now, as a token of my appreciation, I'd like to treat everyone to coffee.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Sounds good.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Yeah, sounds great, um... Although, after the last few days, I don't know if I can handle another coffee. But I can just order something else.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 4 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Sure, let's go.

:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then there was Tighnari &mdash; he put up an amazing fight, too! We ended up winning all three bouts!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Whoa... Part of me wishes I'd been there to see it, but... I'd have been biting my nails off worrying about you guys...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' A truly edifying account of the events. Bereft of detail, but it has livened up the room all the same.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Paimon included all the juicy details! {{Traveler}} just pounced, and then waved their sword like this! Then spun around! And blocked!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Despite winning three bouts in a row, you still ceded the position of leader to him. That's very dignified of you, Cyno.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Of course. Being dignified comes with being a true champion.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I got to be a champion too, for once. I've not sparred much with desert folk before. It was a pretty unique experience.
:{{DIcon}} The venue was pretty impressive too. A very ceremonial affair.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, huge place, it felt like something right out of an epic poem! Imagine this, it was like there was...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Maybe save that one for later, Paimon. Dessert's here.
:{{Black Screen|Everyone enjoys each other's company and the General Mahamatra's generosity. The shockwaves left by the Temple of Silence gradually fade away.}}
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I think that'll do me for today.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Shall we stop off at the House of Daena again before heading home? We should probably finish putting all those books back.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' My thoughts exactly. See you around.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I should get going as well. See you all later! Make sure you get some good rest tonight.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I need to go say thanks to the Corps of Thirty for their help. Also, Sir Naphis said he wanted to introduce me to some of the Akademiya's work processes... So I gotta dash too.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Collei's come a long way. She's much more confident at dealing with other people these days.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Everyone's a work in progress. You never stop learning.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 5 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yeah, true.
<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo cnlq105 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahhh~! That was good. Feels like everything's finally wrapped up now.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Life is all about these moments when you can finally relax and hang out with good friends after a job well done... And also those desserts Cyno got &mdash; they were really good! Paimon definitely needs more of those in the future.
:{{DIcon}} Then let's come back again sometime.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 6 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Do you three have anything planned for the rest of the day?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 6 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If not... Would you come somewhere with me?
:{{DIcon}} Sure, where are we going?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 6 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That's a secret for now. Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 6 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Okay, I think I can guess where you're talking about... It'll definitely be a nice surprise.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, now Paimon's curious! Come on, let's go!

:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Been a while since I last made my way up here.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, look at this place... We're so high up!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Need any help?
:{{DIcon}} Don't underestimate me!
:{{DIcon}} I am actually a tree-climbing champion!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Hahaha... As you wish.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's a nice spot, isn't it.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a great view! We're so high up, we can see for miles.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Turn around.
:{{DIcon}} ...It's beautiful.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' This is my secret base. Somewhere I only bring my best friends.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' When I was a student, I used to slip away and climb up here all the time, just to clear my head. I was quite young then, and hadn't made too many friends yet.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Back then, I had a lot of the same questions that Sethos was asking: Who am I? Why do I have this power? And what should I be fighting for?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Our gifts help us to find our rightful place in the world. That was my experience, and I'm sure Sethos will figure things out in his own time, too.
:{{DIcon}} As long as Hermanubis's power endures...
:{{DIcon}} You will remain inextricably linked to the Temple of Silence.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' You two really are like brothers.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I feel the same way.
:{{DIcon}} You're one tough cookie, Cyno.
:{{DIcon}} You're a true champion now.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Of course. I see no need to be humble when it comes to the facts.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I still remember one time when we came up here to chat and do our homework. Cyno accidentally dropped a fruit... Luckily, he has fast reflexes, so he caught it just in time.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That was the one and only time. Nothing will ever slip through my fingers again.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Ah, those were good times. I kinda miss the student life.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, Paimon really shouldn't be able to imagine Cyno doing something like that. But for some strange reason, the mental image is coming through clear as day...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Then make it stop.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hm? There's somebody there...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...It's Professor Cyrus.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You guys carry on without me. I'll be right back.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Hey! You're not supposed to jump down! Be careful!

;(Talk to Cyrus)
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh my days, I can't believe how stupid I look in this one...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Professor. What are you muttering to yourself about?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Cyno! Just the man I'm looking for! Guess what I found in some old notebooks?

:{{Color|menu|Cyrus takes out a few old yellowed photos that record pieces of his and Cyno's earlier life at the Akademiya...}}
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Some old photos?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Can you believe it? This notebook was just sitting in a pile of odds and ends in the sages' office. I must have forgotten to take it with me, and no one's touched it since. It was still right there.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' I was at the Akademiya earlier to discuss my workload with Naphis. I swung by the old office to have a look around, and just happened across it.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' How time flies. Look how tiny you are in this picture! Still a kid...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You look quite young yourself in that one.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Ah, it's this one! I remember that, [[Lisa]] took it, didn't she?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Yep, looks like her work alright. Who else could've found just the right angle to make me look so unbelievably hideous...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' And this one. Looks like we're both dozing off.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hah, cheeky girl... Taking secret photos of us without our knowledge...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Is there something you'd like to say to me, Professor?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 08.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Like what? Like... "These are good photos, aren't they"...?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 09.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 10.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...Hey. At moments like this, I... I hardly know where to begin.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 11.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...I can't pretend I'm a good person. Bamoun had every reason to despise me, and... Well, so do you, if you feel the same way.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Don't be ridiculous, you old codger.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 12.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ugh. Is that not what you wanted me to say!?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 13.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...I dreamt of that place many times after leaving the desert. Sometimes, I'd dream that I was doing research with them again, and other times, I'd dream of the day they saved my life.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 14.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' It was... one of the happiest times of my life. We all learned so much from one another.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 15.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You've matured so much over the years, Cyno.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Since you're my professor, I should save you some face by not calling you out on all the non-answers you just gave... So, I will do the right thing and keep my mouth shut.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 16.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hmph, good thinking! Take your own advice next time!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 17.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Seriously, why bully an old man like me? I thought heroes were supposed to be gracious...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 18.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hey, wait... Huh, how did I not notice this one earlier...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Lisa strikes again. Just how many did she take?

:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 19.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Look how cute you were when you were little. I remember how well-mannered you were back then, too...
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yeah, and look how serious and professional you used to be.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 20.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh, I can't compete with you anymore... First you get better than me at the deadpan jokes, and now, you're besting me at those little quips, too.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Don't say that. I still have a lot of respect for you.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 21.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hmph. That's more like it.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 22.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...Hey, what would you say to meeting up with Lisa again sometime?
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'd like that. Let's find a time and pay her a visit in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 23.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Alright, I'll add it to my schedule. Let's go next week.
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 spantamadcyrus 24.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Wait no! Next week is the tomato-growing competition. I have got to beat Zaha Hadi!
:{{A|vo cnlq105 8 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Or you could find a real hobby, Professor.
