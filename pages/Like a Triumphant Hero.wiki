;(Upon login)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've spent quite some time in Sumeru City, but ever since we last said goodbye to Lesser Lord Kusanali, we haven't heard anything from her...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* We can't just keep waiting around like this. Let's go find Katheryne and pick up some work so we can at least keep ourselves busy!

;(Talk to Katheryne)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Ad astra abyssosque! We meet again, you two.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi Katheryne, do you have any commissions for us today?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Commissions, huh? Hmmm, let me think...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Oh, how about this? Please attend the Akademiya's academic symposium this afternoon, and recite a love poem onstage.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, wait, say what now?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' And if possible, please also use your Kamera to capture the reaction of the audience upon finishing the poem.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What kind of commission is that?
:{{DIcon}} I feel embarrassed just imagining it.
:{{DIcon}} The audience would definitely have a... reaction.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' I see... It appears that you're not interested in this commission.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 06.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' In that case, please go to Port Ormos and convince the Eremites there to spend some time volunteering at the local orphanage.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! That's not any better!
:{{DIcon}} Isn't that just asking for a beating?
:{{DIcon}} Mercenaries and orphanages really don't go together.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 07.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Mm-hmm, I'm sure the mercenaries will have some interesting reactions as well.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon's gotta ask... Just who exactly has been submitting these commissions to the Adventurers' Guild?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 katheryne 08.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Oh, the commissioner? Hmm, well actually, I just wanted to see the two of you in action...
:{{DIcon}} You're not actually Katheryne, are you?
:{{DIcon}} You're Nahida, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe, was it so obvious? I was hoping you would actually take one of those commissions. That kind of chance to observe humans doesn't come by often...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, so it's Nahida! Paimon just knew Katheryne wouldn't crack those kinds of jokes. When did you get into her head?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm... From when she said "Ad astra abyssosque"?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So it's been you this whole time!?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Are you done resting up, Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. I've been sleeping ever since we parted ways, and I even had a really, really long dream...
:{{DIcon}} So, the Akasha can't take away the dreams of gods?
:{{DIcon}} What did you dream about?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It was another dream about the Sabzeruz Festival, except it was a happy one!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' In my dream, I was sitting in the middle of a flower terrace, and everyone in Sumeru City was holding hands as they danced in circles around me... They danced round and round, and everyone looked really happy.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I also got to sit on a gigantic flower carriage. Farris, the Knight of Flowers, raised me really, really high above the ground, and I was throwing an endless amount of Yalda Candies at the children...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, Nahida, maybe your dream is how the Sabzeruz Festival really should be. It's meant to be a joyous time, where everyone gets together to celebrate your birthday...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah...
:{{DIcon}} But in reality...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Eh? Wasn't I describing a really happy dream? Why are you both looking at me like that... Wait, could this be an example of the emotion known as "pity"?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no, we aren't pitying you! That would only make everything worse. We just don't want you to feel too sad.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, have you had a chance to visit Dunyarzad? How's she doing? The Homayanis haven't allowed any visitors after the festival, so we haven't been able to check on her.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, I paid her a visit right after I woke up. She was resting at the time.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Her condition has stabilized. However, since Eleazar is a manifestation of the Withering on the human body, we can only cure it by finding a way to take care of Irminsul's own withering.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But for the moment, our top focus should still be figuring out what the sages are up to and what they're planning.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right. Who knows what'll happen if they manage to pull off another scheme like the samsara of the Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So, our first priority should be investigating and putting a stop to the sages' activities. As for how we should pull that off, let's discuss it somewhere else. There are too many adventurers around here.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good point! Uh, sorry adventurers, we're gonna be borrowing Katheryne for a little while~!

;(Talk to Nahida)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Let's continue our chat here.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay. So do you have any ideas on how we can investigate the sages, Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Actually, I've already done a little bit of work on that, but for now, I want to hear your thoughts.
:{{DIcon}} Possess a key figure in the Akademiya?
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 1.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I've already tried that, but all the key members of the Akademiya &mdash; even the Corps of Thirty guards &mdash; intentionally avoid wearing their Akasha Terminals.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 2.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It seems that from the very beginning, they've been guarding against info leaks from the Akasha. Of course, it could also be because they're wary of me.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you already caught the sages' attention?
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 3.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm guessing not yet, but distrusting me would make perfect sense if they ever paid attention to the urban legends about me.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03a 4.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' In any case, I probably can't take over their minds directly.
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Possess a student and infiltrate the sages' quarters?
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 1.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No way. That's too risky.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean it'd be too easy to get caught?
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 2.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No, it's not that. We shouldn't involve innocent students in this. A single mistake could completely ruin their lives.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03b 3.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Doing that would be ignoring the safety of my people for my own selfish goals. How is that any different from what the sages are doing?
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 02b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a good point. Spoken like the God of Sumeru!
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} We could grab someone close to the sages and question them?
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03c 1.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We're in the dark as of now. Since we still don't know anything about their goals, any rash move could tip them off and lead to terrible consequences.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 03c 2.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' After all, every person in Sumeru City is one of their hostages.
:;(Return to option selection)
;(After selecting all 3 options)
:{{DIcon}} I can't think of anything else.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Are we really out of ideas?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida, you're super smart, so you already have something in mind, right? Don't keep us in suspense &mdash; spill the beans already!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' According to a popular theory from the Vahumana Darshan of the Akademiya, rejecting impractical motions at the beginning of a planning session will give more weight to the actual proposal.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, okay, but aren't you the God of Wisdom? You don't have to use that kind of gimmick to make us take your ideas seriously.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Well, I've been thinking that if I can't directly possess the leaders, and if I can't get ordinary people involved...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Then I should find someone who's already involved, but hasn't decided to side with the sages.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're saying we should recruit a spy? Hmm, that does sound like it could work.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Before coming back, we met someone named [[Alhaitham]]. He seems like he acts alone, and he likes doing stuff behind the Akademiya's back. They probably aren't in cahoots.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Actually, I already have someone in mind. Do you still remember that female scholar named Setaria?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Setaria... Paimon remembers now! Isn't she the one who's always trailing behind the Grand Sage of the Akademiya?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We ran into her basically every time the Sabzeruz Festival repeated itself. You could even say we're old enemies by now...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon still remembers the smug and mean way she always spoke to Nilou!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Mm-hmm. I've always liked observing all kinds of people, and Setaria has always stood out from the crowd.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' She was born in the desert, and was hailed as their greatest genius. Her academic gifts allowed her special admission into the Akademiya, and also gave her the opportunity to serve as the sages' assistant.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon didn't know she was from the desert! She must be pretty special, then. Paimon feels like most of the desert-dwellers around the city are working as mercenaries.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The name Setaria means "star." When she lived in the desert, she shone like the brightest star in the night sky.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Later on, she was chosen by the Sun. The star was given a place in the daytime sky to complement the Sun's dazzling light.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Soon after, the star witnessed the Sun scorching the earth, which brought forth many disasters.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The star began to waver. Instead of staying beside such a sun, wouldn't it be better to return and light up part of the night sky?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But in the end, she couldn't give up the radiance of daytime. To cope with her shame, the star buried her guilt and closed her eyes...
:{{DIcon}} This is no longer just a metaphor...
:{{DIcon}} Those are Setaria's true thoughts, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' From the sound of it, Setaria's just hung up on the research opportunities here...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But she doesn't really support the Akademiya. She still feels guilty about not doing more for the desert, right...? She's just running away from her problems!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Indeed. When they are presented with complex moral issues, many people will simply plug their ears and go with the flow until the problem can't be fixed anymore.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' She's suppressing a lot of guilt, but before she realized it, she had already become the sages' accomplice. She can't deny her part in their schemes anymore.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds exactly like the person we need.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Right. We must somehow make her face her problems again...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That way, not only can we get useful intel from her, but she can also use it as an opportunity to redeem herself.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' From my past observations, Setaria will take a day off from the Akademiya every ten days to do some shopping in the city.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Tomorrow afternoon just happens to be a shopping day for her. That'll be our chance.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 2 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' To prepare, let's go check out some of her favorite spots, and have a quick chat with a few of the vendors there.
----
;(Approach Nabiya's stall)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This should be Setaria's favorite fortune-telling spot.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... so, should we ask the fortune-teller about Setaria?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No, I already have enough information on Setaria. The most important thing now is for you to pay attention to the vendor's talking style and key characteristics.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Talking style and... key characteristics?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 01.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' My poor lost lambs, have you become troubled over your fates?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 02.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' The divine voice of wisdom often echoes between mine ears. If thou be blessed today by the gods, I may be able to show you the way.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, really? Nahida, you've been whispering things to her?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 katheryne 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq101 3 katheryne 01b.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Shh... Ahem, my friend here has some doubts regarding {{MC|m=his|f=her}} future. Can we get a fortune reading for {{MC|m=him|f=her}}?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 03.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Hummm... of course, of course. In that case...
:'''Nabiya's Cat:''' Meow!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 04.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Oho, it would seem that Harut and Marut are quite wary of you. Perhaps at some time in the past, you have somehow offended the gods?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Only mocking the [[God of Anemo]], questioning the [[Lord of Geo]]'s financial savviness, and brawling with the [[Ei|God of Electro]]... Do those count?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 05.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Oh, nothing. {{Traveler}}, go on, pick an aspect for her to divine.
:{{DIcon}} Divine my prospects in health.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 1.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Health prospects? No problem at all.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 2.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' ...
::{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 3.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Hummm... The gods have spoken. The truth shall be revealed.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06a 4.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Your life shall continue on for... for... Huh!? Many... many tens of thousands of years!? Impossible...
:{{DIcon}} Divine my prospects in love.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 1.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Love prospects? No problem at all.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 2.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' ...
::{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 3.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Hummm... The gods have spoken. The truth shall be revealed.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 06b 4.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' One who is fated to cross your path will appear on... on... Huh!? So... so many people will fall for you!? How could that be...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 07.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Harut, Marut, did you two spoil my divination? I've never read a fortune so absurd.
:'''Cat:''' Meow?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh, actually, Paimon thinks this is probably the most accurate fortune-telling you've ever done...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 08.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Ahem, I admit that the orientation of today's celestial matrix is suboptimal. As such, there will be no charge.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Is that so... Well, that can't be helped.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 3 nabiya 09.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' If you were to bring some food offerings for Harut and Marut on your next visit, perhaps they could help you reverse the wheels of fate?

;(Talk to Nabiya again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq101 nabiya 01.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' I've never seen Harut and Marut be so wary of anyone...
----
;(Approach Akim's stall)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this another one of Setaria's favorite stalls?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yep. It belongs to Akim. His father helped Setaria a lot when she first moved to Sumeru City, so she still comes by whenever she has time.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' When I start talking with him, listen carefully to the details of our conversation.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 akim 01.ogg}} '''Akim:''' Ah, dear customers, would you like to look at some pottery?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We caught wind of your great craftsmanship, so we specifically came to take a look.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 akim 02.ogg}} '''Akim:''' Oh! I recognize you. Aren't you Miss Katheryne from the Adventurers' Guild? Sounds like I'm in for some big business!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Speaking of, where did you learn this trade?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 akim 03.ogg}} '''Akim:''' I suppose you could say it all started with my dad. He's a mason by trade, but I picked up an interest in clay while apprenticing for him.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 akim 04.ogg}} '''Akim:''' After that, I began making pottery by myself in secret, and I simply changed trades when my works turned out well. Although, it's a pity that I'm no longer making much use of the knowledge provided to me by the Akasha...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's nice! You're making a living doing something you love!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm, so is your father still working as a mason?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 akim 05.ogg}} '''Akim:''' Oh no, not anymore. A few years back, he fell from a roof and broke his leg. Since he had already saved enough Mora over all these years, he's just enjoying the retired life in Port Ormos nowadays.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I see. We wish him peace and happiness in his retirement.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'll have someone in charge of logistics at the guild come by another day for some goods. We'll leave you to it. Take care now!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 4 akim 06.ogg}} '''Akim:''' No problem. Rest easy, all our goods are sure to meet your every need.

;(Talk to Akim again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq101 akim 01.ogg}} '''Akim:''' That was my first time talking with Miss Katheryne. Hehe, I'm sure I sounded a bit nervous...
----
;(Approach Qishan)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This should be our final stop. Setaria is always thinking of this restaurant when she's working at the Akademiya, so she always comes by whenever she's out in the city.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida, you've really thought of everything!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe, it's my duty to protect Sumeru's citizens, after all.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hi there. I feel like I've seen you down by the docks before...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 qishan 01.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' Huh? Sorry, I don't quite remember...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If I recall, you were having a discussion with someone about ship-building at the time.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 qishan 02.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' Ah, that's right! I've always been really interested in feats of marine engineering.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 qishan 03.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' After all, I grew up in Liyue Harbor and spent my entire childhood staring at the ships going in and out of the port. I came to Sumeru to study, but failed to make it into the Akademiya due to my lack of talent.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 qishan 04.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' But I'm still discussing all kinds of problems with different scholars, and I'm continuing to study and perform research from the restaurant's basement. I'm sure I'll get into the Akademiya after their next round of exams!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' What an admirable spirit for learning. Amazing!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure... But you'll find hard-working people wherever you go!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So this restaurant has a basement as well? Huh, first I've heard of it.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 qishan 05.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' That's right! It's not usually open to patrons. Most of the time, employees use it for breaks or to hold private events.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I see... Guess that makes sense. Well, good luck with your studies, Miss Qishan.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 5 qishan 06.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' Haha, thank you so much. As long as I can make it into the Akademiya as an official student, I'll be happy.

;(Talk to Qishan again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq101 qishan 01.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' I must have met her somewhere. Why can't I remember?
----
;(Talk to Nahida)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, was that everybody?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Mm-hmm. Three familiar faces should be enough for Setaria.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the point of all the information we've collected? Nahida, you still haven't told us how you're planning to make Setaria face her problems.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Setaria is already used to avoiding her problems, so we must find a way to break through her usual sensibilities.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I remember you mentioned that the Eremites in Port Ormos are all making a fuss about the upcoming resurrection of King Deshret.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Although it's all just a boatload of nonsense, the faith of her homeland may turn out to be Setaria's soft spot.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it now... You want to take advantage of the guilt Setaria feels about her homeland.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Although she knows she should return home to help the people of the desert, all she's done is conspire with the sages...
:{{DIcon}} If King Deshret were to criticize Setaria's actions...
:{{DIcon}} If King Deshret were to make demands of Setaria...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, so how do we set that up?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Well, King Deshret is long gone, and Setaria is also too smart to fall for any simple tricks...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If we simply engaged her under the guise of King Deshret's believers, she'd definitely be wary of us, and we may not get anywhere.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But if we were to "borrow" some of her close acquaintances to talk with her... her reaction would probably be very different.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you mean, you're going to possess those people we just talked to?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yep. Possess them through the Akasha, imply that they've already converted to the faith of King Deshret, and then convey our made-up "will of King Deshret."
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As long as everything goes smoothly, we'll get through to Setaria for sure. She'll never guess that we had anything to do with it.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, so that's how you're going to use all the info we collected on these people &mdash; it's so that you won't slip up and break form! Possessing them will only work if you can manage to pass off as them.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Exactly! So, best of luck with impersonating them.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Best of luck? B&mdash;But we don't know how to possess anyone!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's no problem at all. I'll just share all their senses with you once I've possessed them. As long as you're also wearing an Akasha Terminal, the effect will basically be as if you've possessed them yourself.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 09a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 09b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, that is pretty convenient... But why does {{MC|m=he|f=she}} have to do this? Can't you do it yourself?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Although I've been observing humans for a while, I've never been good at imitating them...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, you're not wrong... It's always been painfully obvious whenever you try to pass as Katheryne.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my best.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' *sigh* If it was at all possible, I would've preferred to leave these people alone, but seeing how things are now, I probably should just accept it and push on.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, don't beat yourself up over it! We're only doing this to help everyone, and we'll only be borrowing them for a little while anyway.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 6 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Alright, then let's give it a go tomorrow afternoon.
----
;(Approach Nabiya the following day)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, here she comes! Setaria's here!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Let's quietly follow her. Once she starts talking to her acquaintances, we'll find a safe spot to begin possessing them.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As for how we'll sway her to our side... I'll leave that to you. {{Traveler}}, I trust you'll know what to say.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, Paimon's starting to feel kinda nervous! Okay, let's go!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like they've already started talking... Let's find a hiding spot and get started!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 01.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...That's right, you really can't force anything when it comes to love. And besides, everyone around me has a very different background and outlook...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 02.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Huh? Are you still listening to me, Nabiya?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 01.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Oh, o&mdash;of course I'm listening! You were talking about troubles with your love life, right? I heard everything you said.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 03.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Ah, okay then. You just seemed a little distracted for a moment there.
:'''Cat:''' Meow!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 04.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Strange... Your cats seem pretty worked up. Is something wrong?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 05.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' I always thought they were quiet, happy kitties... Oh, what are their names again?
:{{DIcon}} Hamru and Tamru.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 06a 1.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Hmm, are you sure? Those aren't ringing a bell for some reason...
::{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 02a 1.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Ah, well... A&mdash;Actually, they have many names. Which names I use depends on my mood.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 06a 2.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Huh, I see. I imagine that must be hard for the kitties, too.
:{{DIcon}} Harut and Marut.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 06b 1.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Ahh, that's right! They are just little darlings, aren't they? Harut and Marut...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 03.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Ahem, so which fortune do you want me to read for you today? You must have come for another echo of the divine voice of wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 07.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Hmm... I'd like to get another reading on my love prospects, but to be perfectly honest with you, I feel like I've been a real mess recently...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 04.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' A mess?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 08.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Well, erm... Could you do a reading on how long it'll take me to finish my current project at work? I really just want to get it over with...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 05.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' I hear you... No problem at all. Uh, the gods will reveal the truth.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 06.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Hummm... Ah, the gods have spoken!
:{{DIcon}} Ohohoho... The gods have spoken!
::{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 09b 1.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Pfft... Sorry, your new laugh is just so hilarious, I couldn't help it...
::{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 07b 1.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Oh! Uh, please pay no mind to those kinds of details.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 08.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' The gods are asking...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 09.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' "Setaria, why haven't you gone home?"
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 10.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Why haven't I gone... home? Do the gods really know everything I've been thinking about...?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 10.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' "Setaria, why don't you just go home!" It's a demand now, instead of a question... The gods seem to be truly upset.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 11.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Ah! Ah... I'm sorry, I know I failed the gods. Please pass on my most sincere apologies and ask for their divine forgiveness...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 12.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' And, if I may ask... Nabiya, is there a specific god who's speaking to you right now?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 11.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Hmph, what an inconsiderate and naive question. The god who is speaking to me is, of course, the wisest and mightiest of all: King Deshret.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 13.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' K&mdash;King Deshret? No wonder he would make such a demand of me... Huh, wait a second... King Deshret passed away a long time ago...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 14.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Even though news of King Deshret's resurrection has been spreading like wildfire, it's all just a misinformation campaign from the Akademiya... How can King Deshret still exist in real life?
:{{DIcon}} (Huh? King Deshret's resurrection is a misinformation campaign?)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 12.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' What insolence! I am King Deshret's most loyal believer. Do you wish to refute his voice of wisdom?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 15.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Oh, no, no... As a child of the desert, I am only reveling in his power upon learning that his divine glory has touched even this city.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 setare 16.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' I will think very carefully about his demand of me... I'm sorry, I must go now.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nabiya 13.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Ah, wait...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, she just ran off in a hurry. She looked pretty upset, too!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Well done, {{Traveler}}! Setaria didn't seem to suspect anything amiss.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' To have something she's been trying desperately to avoid show up out of nowhere and berate her... That must have shaken her to the core.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida, it seems like you understand human emotions really well after all!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' All I know are some abstract Haravatat theories. In any case, my time with you has shown a lot of them to be utterly useless. I'm still trying to make sense of everything...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 7 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Anyway, enough of that. Let's hurry and catch up to Setaria.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's at Akim's now, right on cue! Let's get ready to possess him right away!

;(Talk to Nabiya, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq101 nabiya 02.ogg}} '''Nabiya:''' Huh? What's gotten into Harut and Marut? They seem terrified of me all of a sudden...
----
;(Approach Akim's stall)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 01.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...It's okay, I just got caught up in something.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 02.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Oh, actually, didn't you ask me to help you look for work? What kind of work were you looking for again?
:{{DIcon}} Uh, gardening work.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 03a 1.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Gardening? But don't you hate everything to do with plants? I still remember getting mad at you for secretly throwing away the bonsai that I gave you as a present.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 8 akim 01a 1.ogg}} '''Akim:''' Erm... Well, uh, you see, a friend told me that the secret to self-improvement is to work on things you're not so good at.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 03a 2.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...Fair enough. I didn't think that was something you would consider.
:{{DIcon}} Uh, masonry work.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 03b 1.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Oh, right, your old man's craft... How could I forget?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 04.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Speaking of, how's he doing? Is he feeling any better?
:{{DIcon}} He's feeling a lot better, and he's walking more now.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 05a 1.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Ah, that's good to hear. I've been thinking a lot about him... If I could get some more time off, I'd love to pay him a visit.
:{{DIcon}} He's feeling a lot better. He can lift stuff now.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 05b 1.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Huh? Wasn't he nursing a leg injury? If I recall correctly, his strong arms had always been his pride and joy.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 8 akim 02b 1.ogg}} '''Akim:''' Uhh, he... sprained his arm a while back while trying to show off his strength. I thought you'd heard.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 06.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Actually, while we're talking about him... Is he still living in Port Ormos?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 akim 03.ogg}} '''Akim:''' Yeah, he's been retired there for a while.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 07.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' If you could find the time, please write him a letter. Let him know that recently, faith in King Deshret has taken root in Port Ormos, and has begun to spread across Sumeru...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 08.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' He has a quick temper, and has always been a devout follower of the Dendro Archon... I don't want him to get into a fight with those King Deshret believers because of a difference in beliefs.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 akim 04.ogg}} '''Akim:''' Oh? So who are you siding with in all of this? The Akademiya or King Deshret?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 09.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Uh, I...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 akim 05.ogg}} '''Akim:''' *sigh* I'm so jealous of you &mdash; you were born a child of the desert. Yet, you chose to betray King Deshret, and now you spend all your time with those crooks from the Akademiya...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 10.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Akim...? You don't mean... You've also become a believer of King Deshret?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 akim 06.ogg}} '''Akim:''' What's so strange about becoming a believer of the wise King Deshret? In fact, aren't you the strange one &mdash; the one who still can't pick a side?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 setare 11.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' C&mdash;Can't pick a side... Me?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, {{Traveler}}! Paimon had no idea you'd be so good at this.
:{{DIcon}} Before I knew it, I really started getting into the role.
:{{DIcon}} I wasn't too harsh, was I?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You really zeroed in on the issue and put it right in front of her. It might feel a bit overwhelming for Setaria...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But once everything is over, I'll be sure to pay a visit to her mind and explain everything. Anyway, let's keep going.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon {{Traveler}}! Setaria's already started talking with Qishan!

;(Talk to Akin, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq101 akim 02.ogg}} '''Akim:''' Whoa... What happened just now? Wasn't I talking with Setaria? Where'd she go?
----
;(Follow Setaria)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 01.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...So, Qishan, have you noticed anything weird in the city lately?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 02.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Like... as if someone was trying to preach to you about something.
:{{DIcon}} No, I've been spending all my time studying in the basement.
:{{DIcon}} No, I've been spending all my time studying in the attic.
::{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 03b 1.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Wait, did you just say attic? I thought this place didn't have an attic... Also, don't you usually study in the basement?
::{{A|vo xmaq101 9 qishan 01b 1.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' Uh, well... The restaurant recently added an attic. I've been studying there because it has better lighting.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 qishan 02.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' Oh right, speaking of strange things...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 qishan 03.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' I celebrated the Sabzeruz Festival so many times that I lost count. That was really weird.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 04.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Wait, how could you be aware of that!? That should be impossible. Nothing in the report indicated anything like that...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 qishan 04.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' Are you still failing to realize that the Akademiya's lowly tricks could never deceive all of Sumeru's citizens?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 05.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 06.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...Qishan, don't tell me that you've converted to King Deshret as well?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 qishan 05.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' What an absurd question. You make it sound like I should be ashamed for becoming a believer of King Deshret.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 qishan 06.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' In reality, shouldn't you be the one who is ashamed? You, who worked side-by-side with the Akademiya and treated people as nothing more than experimental subjects?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 07.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Please... Please stop!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even now, Setaria's still trying to run from her problems...
:{{DIcon}} Did I push too hard?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' She can no longer justify everything to herself...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, she's trying to talk to the guards! What should we do?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This is the most important part of all. Quick, get ready!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 08.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...Mercenary, you're a member of the Corps of Thirty, correct? Please help me pass a message to the matra right away. The situation in the city is getting out of control...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 01.ogg}} '''Rima:''' Please, try to remain calm, miss. Tell me, what's happening in the city?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 09.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Heretics are infiltrating the city, and they've already converted many residents to their side...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 02.ogg}} '''Rima:''' Heretics? What kind of heresy are you talking about?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 10.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' King Deshret! Many people I know have suddenly started believing in him, but he's long dead... It's impossible...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 03.ogg}} '''Rima:''' Miss Setaria... Nothing is impossible.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 11.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Y&mdash;You know my name?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 04.ogg}} '''Rima:''' King Deshret is immortal, and all who defy him will one day pay the price.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 05.ogg}} '''Rima:''' You must face the truth, Setaria. You tread a treacherous path, and the longer you ignore it, the tighter the Akademiya's grasp on you will become, and the deeper you will be ensnared.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 06.ogg}} '''Rima:''' Child of King Deshret, never forget that the desert that belongs to you lies elsewhere.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 8 akim 06.ogg}} '''Akim:''' What's so strange about becoming a believer of the wise King Deshret? In fact, aren't you the strange one &mdash; the one who still can't pick a side?

:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 12.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 13.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' *sigh* ...It seems that no matter where I run, I only keep finding more believers of King Deshret. I have to say, this is a familiar feeling...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 14.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' I've also been running from my guilt this whole time... Guilt over my part in the sages' plans, and from ignoring the letters from the children of my homeland.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 15.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' But no matter how much I may try to ignore or get rid of it, my guilt always comes back.
:{{DIcon}} You should follow your heart.
:{{DIcon}} It's not too late to turn back.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 07.ogg}} '''Rima:''' You won't necessarily lose your research opportunities by facing the truth. Besides, did you really want to conduct your research while carrying such heavy feelings of guilt?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 16.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' How do you know me so well? Are you truly just a believer of King Deshret, or are you the god himself?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 08.ogg}} '''Rima:''' That's not important. The important thing is to pass judgment on the Akademiya and its sages, and to correct their mistakes.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 09.ogg}} '''Rima:''' If you could provide some assistance in this matter, perhaps it could serve as a form of atonement.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 17.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' I've actually never believed in the gods, but I've always believed in serendipity. Your appearance must be a fated opportunity for me to get out of this wretched situation.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 18.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Please tell me... What can I do for you?
:{{DIcon}} (Great, we've finally convinced her.)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 10.ogg}} '''Rima:''' Ahem... How much do you know about the sages' current activities?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 19.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' I was just one of the designers for the Mass Dream Harvest scheme... which is what happened around the Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 20.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' But I know very little about the full scope of the overall project. I'd assume that only staff with the highest clearance would have access to those confidential documents...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 21.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' I've just been working to meet the Grand Sage's specified requirements.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 22.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' However, there's something that's been really bothering me... I heard that a scholar who was previously expelled has returned to the city, and even the sages are still quite wary of him...
:{{DIcon}} (An outcast that even the sages are still wary of?)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 11.ogg}} '''Rima:''' To fight against the Akademiya, we will need to figure out the nature and the purpose of their work. Is there a way for us to get access to the confidential documents you mentioned?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 23.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' It should be possible if we're willing to take some risks. After all, I'm an assistant to the Grand Sage, and I've been working on many tasks outside of the project.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 24.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' One thing, though... I won't be able to transfer the documents to you through the Akasha once I get my hands on them. The sages have always closely monitored all activities within the Akasha.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 25.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Hmm, let me see... Let's use the most primitive method. Send someone to pick up the documents tomorrow evening at the Akademiya entrance.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 12.ogg}} '''Rima:''' The Akademiya entrance... Wouldn't that be too conspicuous?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 26.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Don't worry about that. I assure you, this won't be a trap.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 27.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' I'm only suggesting this location because it'll draw more scrutiny for me to leave the Akademiya again. It'll be safest for me to distract the guards long enough to hand you the documents.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 13.ogg}} '''Rima:''' Alright, I trust you.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 28.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' So... If I were to successfully complete this task, would it mean I've atoned for my wrongdoings?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 rima 14.ogg}} '''Rima:''' Umm... That'll depend on the judgment of the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 29.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' The Dendro Archon... That's right, her people are the ones we have endangered. As the God of Wisdom, she's also the one responsible for judging and guiding the scholars.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 setare 30.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' ...Maybe it's time for me to find a god to believe in.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just as Nahida predicted, we've managed to bring Setaria to our side...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 nahida 03a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq101 9 nahida 03b.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' {{Traveler}}'s execution was ingenious. {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s the one who deserves all the praise.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Well, now that we've made plans to meet again tomorrow evening, all we can do is pray for Setaria's mission to go off without a hitch.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pray? But if we're going to pray to the gods, aren't we just praying to you, God of Wisdom and guardian of the scholars?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 9 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Me? No, no. The truth is the true guardian of scholars &mdash; I've always believed that. Anyway, let's meet again tomorrow evening at the Adventurers' Guild.

;(Talk to Qishan again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq101 qishan 02.ogg}} '''Qishan:''' *yawn* I seem to have dozed off just now... Maybe I studied way too late last night? Ah, I'm sorry, can I help you with anything?
----
;(Approach Katheryne the following night)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Katheryne, we're here! Oh, hmm... You're the "other" Katheryne, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's right. I suppose I'm the "other Katheryne" in your mind.
:{{DIcon}} Can't we just call her Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shh...! We're on a secret mission tonight, so we need to protect Katheryne's identity!
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yep, Paimon's right. We cannot fully rule out the chance that the meet-up tonight is just a trap.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If something were to happen, my existence may be the only trump card we'll be able to play.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' After all, the Akademiya should still be unable to confirm the existence of my consciousness in the outside world.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, yep! Exactly, just what Paimon was thinking!
:{{DIcon}} I somehow doubt that...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... Anyway, enough about that! Let's just make sure to be on our guard!
:{{DIcon}} Speaking of which...
:{{DIcon}} Don't you feel like something is off?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Off? What do you feel is off?
:{{DIcon}} It's just a little too quiet around here.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's the middle of the night &mdash; of course it's quiet! You're not getting paranoid, are you?
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 nahida 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq101 10 nahida 05b.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No, I think {{Traveler}}'s right. It really is a lot quieter than usual.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If you look around, there seems to be fewer people on the streets. I'm not sure if this is the case for the entire city, though...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, maybe it's just a coincidence? Maybe Setaria figured out a way to not only distract the guards, but also to get everyone to go to sleep early, just so we can exchange the documents in peace.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I also can't quite figure out why things feel a little off... But, now that we're here, let's go ahead and meet her as we planned.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, regardless... as long as you're here with us, Paimon feels a little safer!

;(On the way to The Akademiya)
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, there really aren't many people out right now... Let's hope it'll be this quiet in front of the Akademiya, and that Setaria managed to distract all the guards...

;(Approach The Akademiya)
;(A cinematic plays)
{{Cutscene Description|You and "Katheryne" arrive at the gate of the Akademiya, only to find that a huge crowd has been waiting. Their elated faces seem to indicate that they are expecting someone. What shocks you more still is to see Dottore, the Second of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, with them.<br>It turns out that it was he who created this bizarre scene. By adjusting the Akasha Terminals, he managed to distribute information directly into people's consciousnesses. Now, everyone believes that you are the hero who just saved the world and are frantically throwing themselves at you. These are merely innocent people, so you find yourself in a dilemma. At this moment, Nahida's consciousness, which is residing in Katheryne, takes control of the people's minds. This stopped them and created an opportunity for you to escape the scene. But at the same time, Dottore discovered the secret hidden within "Katheryne"...}}
:;(Cheering citizens line the sides of the ramp towards the Akademiya entrance)
::'''Paimon:''' What are all these people doing here
::'''Paimon:''' At this hour of the night?
:;(A man starts to walk down the ramp)
::'''Dottore:''' Ah, the triumphant hero returns at last
::'''Dottore:''' And to a rather spectacular welcome, even if I do say so myself
::'''Nahida:''' You're...
::'''Nahida:''' The outcast, expelled from the Akademiya...
::'''Dottore:''' Indeed, I am, although these days they tend to call me:
::'''Dottore:''' The Doctor
::{{Black Screen|''{{Rubi|Il Dottore|Omega Build|center=1}}, The Doctor &mdash; The Second of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers''}}
::'''Dottore:''' If you're looking for your researcher friend, she has already been taken into confinement
::'''Dottore:''' With some basic caution, she could have discovered the listening device on her person
::'''Dottore:''' Clearly, she lacks the degree of rigor expected of a true scholar
::'''Nahida:''' The people of Sumeru City...
::'''Nahida:''' What have you done to them?
::'''Dottore:''' I simply made some minor adjustments to their Akasha Terminals
::'''Dottore:''' Now they can deposit information directly into the subconscious
:;(The citizens start to walk slowly towards the Traveler and company)
::'''Dottore:''' As you can see, all these lovely people now believe
::'''Dottore:''' This Traveler is a hero who has just saved the world
::'''Dottore:''' Hehe... My experiment is a success
:;(The citizens seem to become more manic, and the Traveler steps back)
::'''Dottore:''' And now, it seems they can no longer hold back their sheer adoration
::'''Paimon:''' Oh no
::'''Paimon:''' What should we do!? These are all just regular people...
:;("Katheryne" stands between the Traveler and the crowd)
::'''Nahida:''' Leave now
::'''Nahida:''' You need to get out of here
::'''Paimon:''' But...
::'''Paimon:''' That guy's a Fatui Harbinger! We can't just leave you here...
::'''Nahida:''' Nor can I abandon... the people of Sumeru!
:;(Nahida takes control of the citizens' Akasha Terminals, causing them to fall unconscious)
::'''Nahida:''' Don't worry
::'''Nahida:''' We'll meet again outside of the city
:;(The Traveler and Paimon leave. Il Dottore closes in on Nahida, who is still controlling the people)
::'''Dottore:''' I see... You appear to have overridden their mental faculties
::'''Dottore:''' With your own consciousness
::'''Dottore:''' To possess such a powerful mind...
::'''Dottore:''' You must be...
::'''Dottore:''' The God of Wisdom
:;(Cinematic ends)

:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This should be far enough... Phew, Paimon needs to catch her breath first.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is Nahida going to be okay? We only made it out because of her...
:{{DIcon}} She can jump between minds. Hopefully she'll be fine?
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure... that guy was pretty terrifying.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wasn't counting on running into a new Harbinger here, let alone such a high-ranking one! That guy was number two... so scary...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He called himself "The Doctor"... Remember Tighnari told us about him. Setaria did say that someone who once got expelled from the Akademiya came back recently...
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...and that even the sages are wary of him. Yep, sounds like she must've been talking about The Doctor.
:{{DIcon}} We underestimated the scale of this problem.
:{{DIcon}} We underestimated the number of parties involved.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. Now that The Doctor's in the picture, we're no longer just dealing with the Akademiya &mdash; they're in cahoots with the Fatui.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But what are the Fatui after this time? Another Gnosis?
:{{DIcon}} We need to find a way to reunite with Nahida.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, things would be a lot easier with Nahida's help.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida said "We'll meet again outside of the city," but we can't just keep waiting around, right?
:{{DIcon}} Let's start our own investigation.
:{{DIcon}} Let's go find someone else who might be involved.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? You mean...
:{{DIcon}} Let's go find Tighnari.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Right, wasn't he invited by the sages to work on some project when we were staying with him in the Avidya Forest? That has to be the same project.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even though he turned it down at that time, he might still know something.
:{{A|vo xmaq101 11 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's no time to lose. Let's go to Gandharva Ville!
