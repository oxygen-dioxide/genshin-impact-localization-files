The '''Wanderer''' is a playable {{Anemo}} [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

The Wanderer came into existence in place of his [[Scaramouche|previous incarnation]] after the latter [[Irminsul#Modifications|expunged]] his previous appellations and their respective histories from [[Irminsul]]. Harboring his former self's memories after willingly regaining them, "Wanderer" is now the only title he goes by, for he has no home, kin, or destination.

During the {{Quest|As Though Morning Dew}}, the player can change the Wanderer's name, which will then be used in some of the game's interfaces, such as [[Party Setup]]. Most characters, however, will refer to him by the name of '''Hat Guy''', the name [[Nahida]] used upon enrolling him to [[Vahumana]].
