|description    = A large and luxurious tent made with thick and sturdy fabric. This is a special construction born from the [[Knights of Favonius]]'s years of camping out in the wild. It was once built by [[Lisa]], the [[Traveler|Honorary Knight]], and [[Paimon]] to set up an alchemy shop beside [[Cider Lake]].<br>Unlike normal wildland tents, this alchemy-shop-specialized tent has an eye-catching exterior to attract customers from afar, and also emphasizes practicality to ensure that the internal warmth and humidity are within optimal range to preserve the alchemical ingredients.<br>Unfortunately, due to the immense weight of this tent and the complexity of setting it up, the Knights do not presently intend to continue producing this tent type.
