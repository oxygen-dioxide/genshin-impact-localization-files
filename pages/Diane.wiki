{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Diane:''' Sorry, but Diona will be on leave for the duration of the festival... Oh, you're not here to see Diona? That's rare.
<!--The icon below is not as exactly the same as in-game but the closest I can find.-->
:{{DIcon|GeneralGoods}} I'd like to sell wine-making ingredients.
::'''Diane:''' One moment please, let me have a look around for Miss Margaret's acquisition list. Now, where did I put it...
:;(Open menu for Selling Ingredients)
:{{DIcon}} Diona and Margaret aren't here?
::'''Diane:''' Yes, Miss Diona's mood tends to sour when Weinlesefest comes around, so Miss Margaret gave her some time off.
::'''Diane:''' But that's understandable. After all, the number of booze hounds at the wine market far exceeds that which you might find at the tavern.
::'''Diane:''' As for Miss Margaret, she certainly wouldn't pass up the festivities just to run the business. She's probably off somewhere drinking and having a good time as we speak.
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Diane:''' See you, happy Weinlesefest!
