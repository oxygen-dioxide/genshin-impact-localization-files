==Profile==
Genevieve is a former member of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. She ended up in the [[Fortress of Meropide]] for striking a colleague, [[Champvallon]], in anger during an academic conference. In the fortress, Genevieve teams with [[Poiret]] to play Coupon Millionaire. During ''Game of the Rich'', Genevieve's team gives their points to [[Rave]]. But Genevieve and Rave ultimately lose to the Kids team ([[Traveler]], [[Caterpillar]]).<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Game of the Rich}}</ref> In [[Both Brains and Brawn]], Poiret and Genevieve team up again to compete in the Pankration tournament and they are coached by the Traveler.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Both Brains and Brawn}}</ref>
