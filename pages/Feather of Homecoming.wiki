{{Description|A blue arrow fletching imbued with the sentiment of travelers that had once faded into the horizon.}}
'''Feather of Homecoming''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Resolution of Sojourner]].

==Description==
Hope was ripped to shreds by ruthless might, and promises of reunion disappeared like fleeting shadows.<br />The wandering traveler had once against lost a place to call home.

The condescending evil stole his love's joy,<br />And the endless conflict ground down his irreverent soul.<br />Those gentle, playful rhythms of revelry,<br />Now turned to sharp, icy clangs.

For his comrades, for his best friend, for the tables around which none would again share wine.<br />For freedom, for life, and for revenge against the evil that had taken her smile.<br />Thus resolved, the traveler plucked his last string, and fired his final arrow.

As he grew accustomed to life in this foreign land, he gazed up at the azure sky.<br />Ah, so the sky here was the same as the one back in his homeland...
