:::'''Huai'an:''' Well played! You're as good at cards as you are at martial arts!
:{{DIcon}} How's business been lately?
::'''Huai'an:''' Thanks to yourself and all our dear guests, business has been going reasonably well. We will get by.
::'''Huai'an:''' Haha, it's getting livelier again.
::{{DIcon}} What can you tell me about the rumors?
:::'''Huai'an:''' Rumors? What rumors?
:::'''Huai'an:''' If you mean someone's been bad-mouthing the Wangshu Inn, don't believe a word of what you hear.
:::'''Huai'an:''' But if you just wanted to get the lowdown about what's been going on recently...
:::'''Huai'an:''' The [[Fatui]]'s presence in [[Liyue Harbor]] has been growing recently. It looks like trouble is brewing.
:::'''Huai'an:''' Now it's your turn! Any interesting stories to share with me?
::{{DIcon}} Who's this lovely doggie?
:::'''Huai'an:''' This is Richie! We called him that hoping it would bring us good luck.
:::'''Huai'an:''' He's a good boy, aren't you Richie? He doesn't make a mess and he's good with the guests.

::'''Huai'an:''' Ah yes, that would be my wife. She moved from Mondstadt to marry me.
::'''Huai'an:''' When I was a child we used to sing this nursery rhyme about Liyue women: "Half the girls marry to a winery town, the other half sail to a faraway land."
::'''Huai'an:''' Oh, how the tables have turned... I feel quite proud to have broken the mold! Hahaha.
::'''Huai'an:''' Goldet is very sharp. She picks up on all these little details about people and figures out their backgrounds.
:{{DIcon}} Please excuse me.
::'''Huai'an:''' Alright, goodbye. Stop in for a chat anytime! You're always welcome at the Wangshu Inn.
