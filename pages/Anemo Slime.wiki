==Stats==
{{Enemy Stats|anemo_res=Immune|hp_ratio=0.8|atk_ratio=.6|hp_type=1}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Bump:''' Moves away and briefly '''inflates''' before shooting itself at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.
*'''Fall Immunity:''' When knocked off the ground, the Anemo Slime will '''inflate''' and flap its wings to slowly float down, making them unable to take fall DMG.
*'''Inflated:''' If the Anemo Slime takes DMG while inflated, it will be instantly defeated regardless of the amount of DMG dealt. However, it is still immune to {{Color|Anemo DMG}} in this state.
*'''Final Burst:''' When defeated, releases a short burst of wind, [[Vacuum Field|pushing]] the player back slightly before dropping any collectible loot.

==Strategy==
*The Anemo Slime can be instantly defeated on hit while it is inflated, which can be easily achieved with ranged or [[AoE]] abilities.
*Staying close to the Anemo Slime will prevent it from attacking.

==Trivia==
*The Anemo Slimes are seen in [[Jean]]'s [[Sea Breeze Dandelion]] outfit splash art.
