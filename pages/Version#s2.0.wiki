;System
*Once your account for PSN is linked to a valid email address, you will be able to log in on iOS/Android/PC using your miHoYo Account, or on PlayStation using the account for PSN linked to the email address associated with your miHoYo Account and resume your game progress.
**There are two methods for linking:
***Method 1 (Retain Prior Progress From miHoYo Account on Mobile/PC): On the PlayStation platform, using an account for PSN that has never previously logged in to Genshin Impact, open the game for the first time. Follow the steps in the pop-up window to link the email address associated with your miHoYo Account. This will link both accounts.
**<nowiki>*</nowiki>IMPORTANT: The pop-up window prompting you to link your accounts only appears when your account for PSN enters the game for the first time, after you agree to the Terms of Service. You can only link an existing miHoYo Account from this pop-up window. There is no other way to link.
***Method 2 (Retain Prior Progress From Account for PSN): Log in to Genshin Impact on the PlayStation platform, then go to Settings > Account > User Center > Link Account and link your account for PSN that is logged in to Genshin Impact to an email address that has not already been used to register a miHoYo Account. After linking, your game progress will be shared when you log into your account to play on the same server on iOS/Android/PC/PlayStation.
**Genesis Crystals
***Genesis Crystals obtained on PC or mobile platforms and Genesis Crystals obtained on PlayStation will not be linked for the same account. This includes but is not limited to Genesis Crystals obtained via the following means: topping-up, refunds, and compensation for top-up errors for Blessing of the Welkin Moon and Battle Pass.
**For more information, please refer to the HoYoLAB notice, "Notice on Cross-Save Function Between Account for PSN and miHoYo Account")

*Adds a second confirmation when removing friends.
*Adjusts the Waverider's Stamina mechanism: The Waverider's stamina is now independent of that of the character's, and Stamina Regeneration is also calculated separately for each.

#Fixes an issue whereby some [[Artifacts/Sets|Artifact set]] names were displayed incorrectly in the rewards preview screen of Domains. The Artifact set names have been corrected to reflect their corresponding Set Bonus.

#*"Already" implies that the player knew how to create a certain item prior to this instance, which is misleading. It was thus removed.
#*"Already" implies that the player had summoned a Waverider prior to this instance, which is misleading. It was thus removed.

==Known Issues==
# When the character, "Kätzlein Cocktail" [[Diona]] uses her Elemental Skill "[[Icy Paws]]," to generate a shield, if the skill is used again during the effect's duration, there is an issue whereby the Base Shield DMG Absorption will not reset, and only its duration is extended. This issue will be fixed in Version 2.1.
# There is a mistake in the description of the [[Traveler (Electro)|Electro Traveler]]'s Lv. 6 Constellation (the actual effects of the skill in-game work as intended). Original description: "Every 2 Falling Thunder attacks triggered by Bellowing Thunder will increase the DMG dealt by the next Falling Thunder by 100%, and will restore an additional 1 Energy to the current character." The description will be adjusted to: "Every 2 Falling Thunder attacks triggered by [[Bellowing Thunder]] will significantly increase the DMG dealt by the next Falling Thunder, dealing 200% of its original DMG, and will restore an additional 1 Energy to the current character." This issue will be fixed in Version 2.1.
# The description of the 4-Piece Set effect of the Artifact, [[Shimenawa's Reminiscence]] is unclear (actual effects of the skill in-game work as intended). Original description: "When casting an Elemental Skill, if the character has 15 or more Energy, they lose 15 Energy and Normal/Charged/ Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 50% for 10s." The description will be adjusted to: "When casting an Elemental Skill, if the character has 15 or more Energy, they lose 15 Energy and Normal/Charged/ Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 50% for 10s. This effect will not trigger again during that duration." This issue will be fixed in Version 2.1.

If you encounter this issue, please exit the game via the Paimon Menu before logging in again as a temporary fix.
# Under specific circumstances, the open world mechanism "[[Electro Cube]]s" in Inazuma will not rotate after being attacked by characters, making the puzzle impossible to solve.

# "Frostflake Heron" [[Kamisato Ayaka]]'s Elemental Burst [[Kamisato Art: Soumetsu|Frostflake Seki no To]] may unexpectedly disappear when attacked by opponents. The developers are already working to fix this issue, please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact time of the fix.
# Under specific circumstances, the completion of the World Quest "[[Fate of a Fighter]]" will not unlock the related achievement, "They Shall Not Grow Old." This issue will be fixed in an update on July 29.

Travelers affected by this issue can exit the game from the Paimon Menu and log in again to continue progressing in the quest.
# After completing the World Quest "[[The Gourmet Supremos: The Importance of Eating Well]]," Travelers fail to obtain the quest reward "[[Recipe: Sashimi Platter]]." The developers are currently working to fix the issue, we will promptly notify Travelers via in-game notice once the issue has been resolved.
