'''Itaru''' was a historical figure in Inazuma who lived far in the past. She was the eldest of the Six Kitsune who trained by [[Hakushin]].

==Profile==
According to ''[[New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune]]'', unlike most other females, Itaru is big as a bear and strong as a tiger. She also had a wild and unruly personality. Despite Hakushin's rigorous training, Itaru's personality remains unchanged, often drinking and breaking things. However, she has also achieved many merits such as defeating and taming the Twin Oni of Tokaku, and even exposing a [[tanuki]] disguised as a dishonest merchant.
