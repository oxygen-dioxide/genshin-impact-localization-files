'''Itaru''' was a historical figure in Inazuma who lived far in the past. She was the eldest of the Six Kitsune who trained by [[Hakushin]].

==Profile==
Unlike most other females, Itaru is big as a bear and strong as a tiger. She also had a wild and unruly personality. Despite Hakushin's rigorous training, Itaru's personality remains unchanged, often drinking and breaking things.<ref>{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|2}}</ref> However, she has also achieved many merits such as defeating and taming the Twin Oni of Tokaku,<ref>{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|3}}</ref> and even exposing a [[tanuki]] disguised as a dishonest merchant.<ref>{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|5}}</ref>
