|description    = A pot made of undried [[Karmaphala Wood]] with common flowers planted inside. As unremarkable as it seems, this small potted plant can also reflect the undeniable vitality of the rainforest in the eyes of those who firmly believe in the [[Dendro Archon]] and the miracle of life.<br>[[Forest Rangers]] are sometimes tasked with investigating the ecological conditions of various places in the rainforest. They need to obtain soil samples from designated areas and cultivate a variety of plants to confirm the nutrient content in the soil sample. Given that these pots have a simple structure and are easy to make, Forest Rangers often use them for such tasks. After the work is completed, these pots will be delivered to the local residents as home decorations.
