==Profile==
Aderfi was originally a member of the [[Tanit]] tribe and used as an intermediary between them and the [[Fatui]] to facilitate trade. When [[Jeht]] arrived after following her [[Jebrael|father's]] notes,  her companion [[Benben]] malfunctioned and she asked him to help fix it. When the [[Traveler]] arrived, Aderfi saw a chance to consolidate more power and hired Eremites to ambush them when Jeht was gone. The Traveler repelled the ambush and informed [[Babel]] of the treachery, but he had already fled.

Aderfi would later conspire with [[Azariq]] to overthrow Babel, sending reinforcements to help him take the Jinni [[Liloupar]]. However, this plot too also failed and Azariq was killed by Jeht, upon which they saw him with the Fatui waiting for news. Jeht, already enraged by Azariq's betrayal, attacked Aderfi and his cronies, upon which they fled from the scene and found a note detailing their plot to dispose Babel. 

===Personality===
Aderfi is a conniving merchant who constantly deceives others for his own gain. When he colluded with the Fatui, he would frequently trick them into obtaining whatever he wanted while intentionally avoiding to acquire whatever they requested for. Like Azariq, Aderfi did not think highly of Jeht, having considered her a "traitor's daughter" due to Jebrael leaving the tribe and was disgusted by the blatant favoritism that Babel gave her.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aderfi:''' Hmph. Strange... And what are the scouts even doing? Did they just let you in?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Aderfi:''' This is the campsite of the Tanit tribe... Heh, we are new here as well. The original camp was unsuitable for hunting, so the elders led us here.
::{{DIcon}} Elders...
:::'''Aderfi:''' ...
:::'''Aderfi:''' That doesn't concern you, outsider. In Tanit, when a matriarch dies, matters will be deliberated by the "Nine Elders."
:::'''Aderfi:''' When that happens, well, imagine nine mouths quarreling endlessly... Quite a spectacle, I assure you.
:::'''Aderfi:''' Hmph. At least the flowing winds are changing their paths... Far quieter now. A little more peace is always welcome.
:{{DIcon}} What do you do here?
::'''Aderfi:''' Business. As you may have noticed, I am a merchant, and am in charge of striking deals on behalf of my tribe.
::'''Aderfi:''' Cosmetics, luxury items, costumes, toys, agricultural products, intricate tools... If you want it, I can get it.
::{{DIcon}} Can I buy anything?
:::'''Aderfi:''' Apologies. According to tribe rules, we cannot sell to outsiders.
:::'''Aderfi:''' Understand, this is not due to xenophobia or some kind of base prejudice. It's more like... Our tribe and the merchants in the cities don't share economic spheres, if you can glean my meaning?
:{{DIcon}} You have so many books...
::'''Aderfi:''' And you have so many words, young one.
::'''Aderfi:''' Stop staring at those books... Let me tell you a tale. A tale regarding a most meddlesome and naive wayfarer to wanted to report our tribe to the Matra. Can you guess what happened?
::'''Aderfi:''' ... What happened was someone discovered the foolishness he was about to commit, and that someone helped us fix his long and loose tongue.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Aderfi:''' Don't let me get in your way.
