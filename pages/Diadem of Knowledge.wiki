The '''Diadem of Knowledge''' is a famous crown regarded as a valuable treasure in [[Sumeru]]. Wearing the Diadem of Knowledge is considered a great honor and was the right of the winner of the [[Interdarshan Championship]] for the last twenty years.

The Diadem of Knowledge is said to have been built by a famous craftsman "in ancient times" and is recorded in old books. It is also said to have "a secret that no one knows."<ref name="sachin article">{{Ref/Quest|Sachin's Article}}</ref>

A little over twenty years before the events of [[A Parade of Providence]], after [[Sachin]] returned to [[Sumeru City]] disheartened from his years in the desert, he happened to be in a position to purchase the Diadem of Knowledge, and he sold many of his assets to do so.<ref name="to claim the crown" /><ref group="Note">The following narration places Sachin's acquisition of the Diadem of Knowledge after his time in the desert led him to his disheartened conclusion about human nature:<br>'''Sachin:''' Twenty-eight years ago, I came to the desert and lived there for eight full years. [...]<br>[...]<br>'''Sachin:''' The things I witnessed there tormented me greatly. I wished desperately to find a way to save them.<br>[...]<br>'''Sachin:''' But in the end, I found that the answer I sought simply did not exist.<br>[...]<br>'''Sachin:''' After this realization, I could no longer see the meaning in anything that I had ever learned. Consumed by an overwhelming sense of emptiness, I could no longer bear to face life... and so I decided to bring my life to an end.<br>'''Sachin:''' But before I went through with it, a strange twist of fate led me to come into the possession of this diadem, which has the ability to preserve part of one's consciousness. Into it, I placed my experiences, before requesting that the Akademiya manage my estate.</ref><ref group="Note">It is more likely that Sachin sold his assets after he returned to Sumeru City than while he was still in the desert, as selling enough assets while in the desert would require Sachin either to be able to sell them while away from them or to have enough of them on his person in the desert, neither of which seem plausible.</ref> Sachin kept the Diadem of Knowledge in a storage room in his house, from which the other members of the household would begin to occasionally hear a high-pitched voice, presumably of unknown origin. Sachin himself would also enter the storage room and research the diadem non-stop for a period of several days.<ref name="to claim the crown">{{Ref/Quest|To Claim the Crown}}</ref>

Sachin eventually discovered that the diadem could "preserve part of one's consciousness" and "placed [his] experiences" into it before signing the contract to entrust or donate his properties, including the Diadem of Knowledge, to the Akademiya shortly before the next [[Akademiya Extravaganza]].<ref name="to claim the crown" /><ref name="when the curtains close">{{Ref/Quest|When the Curtains Close}}</ref> After the Diadem of Knowledge was donated to the Akademiya, it was added to the Interdarshan Championship to be worn by the winner of each competition in accordance with Sachin's wishes.<ref name="suspicions aroused">{{Ref/Quest|Suspicions Aroused}}</ref>

The same year that the Diadem of Knowledge was donated to the Akademiya, an Interdarshan Championship was held. During the final round, Sachin revealed himself to [[Kaveh's father]], who was likely mentally assaulted with Sachin's words and emotions via the Diadem of Knowledge.<ref group="Note">This conclusion is based on the mental experience that Kaveh has with the Diadem of Knowledge, as shown in ''[[To Claim the Crown]]'', explained by Kaveh himself in ''[[The Arc of Intellect]]'', and further supported by Kaveh's declaration in ''[[When the Curtains Close]]'' that with the diadem shattered, Sachin's words will never hurt anyone again.</ref> Kaveh's father was negatively affected enough that an [[Aranara]] named [[Arakasyapa]], who still remembered being taught how to read and write in a human script by Kaveh's father as a child, took away the Diadem of Knowledge and hid it in a tree hollow,<ref name="when the curtains close" /><ref name="that incident from twenty years ago">{{Ref/Quest|"That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"}}</ref><ref group="Note">''[["That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"]]'' indicates that after the final round, Arakasyapa hid the Diadem of Knowledge in a tree hole in order to protect the human who taught it how to read. ''[[The Contestant]]'' suggests that the human was the same human who helped Aaru Village and died in quicksand. ''When the Curtains Close'' shows that the human spoken of in ''The Contestant'' is Kaveh's father, as deduced by both the Traveler and Alhaitham.</ref> where it would later be found by the employee who was in charge of the Diadem of Knowledge.<ref name="sachin article" /> However, the damage had already been done, and Kaveh's father fell into depression. His actions afterward due to the empathy and kindness in him that caused Sachin to take notice of him in the first place would eventually lead to his early death.<ref name="the contestant">{{Ref/Quest|The Contestant}}</ref> While the change in the personality of Kaveh's father was noticeable, his encounter with Sachin went unreported and undiscovered.

The Diadem of Knowledge was used in every Interdarshan Championship in the twenty years that followed, seemingly without incident.<ref name="to claim the crown" /> Sachin's consciousness in the Diadem of Knowledge, through which he watched every Interdarshan Championship in hopes of finding a suitable inheritor for his research and wealth,<ref group="Note">According to the excerpt of Sachin's words in ''[[Suspicions Aroused]]'', Sachin stated that he would watch for suitable candidates in the Interdarshan Championship "[e]ach year." This conflicts with Wiqas's statement in ''[[Opening Festivities]]'' that the Interdarshan Champion is held every four years and is seemingly supported by Kareena's statement in ''To Claim the Crown'' that the Diadem of Knowledge "has been used in every Extravaganza," which occurs yearly due to the yearly Wisdom Gala. However, at the end of ''To Claim the Crown'', Sachin says the reward of his wealth was meant to "draw out the worthiest of individuals," making it clear that he was specifically watching the Interdarshan Championships.</ref> remained undetected the entire time by everyone<ref name="suspicions aroused" /> except [[Nahida]].<ref name="the arc of intellect" />

In the Interdarshan Championship held during A Parade of Providence, Nahida enlists the help of the [[Wanderer]] to keep an eye on the competition and intervene if anything went wrong. During the opening ceremony, the Diadem of Knowledge was displayed, causing the [[Traveler]] &mdash; and only the Traveler &mdash; to have a vision of Sachin onstage when they looked at it.<ref name="opening festivities">{{Ref/Quest|Opening Festivities}}</ref> Later in the competition, Sachin decided on [[Kaveh]] as his successor. In the final round, during which the participants fought to be the one to place the Diadem of Knowledge on a stand, [[Layla]] and the Wanderer hold the diadem without any noticeable effects. However, when Kaveh is finally in possession of the diadem, it begins leaking black wisps.<ref name="to claim the crown" /> Kaveh then hears Sachin's voice in his head and is mentally assaulted by Sachin's emotions and ideas, giving him a splitting headache.<ref name="the arc of intellect">{{Ref/Quest|The Arc of Intellect}}</ref> When Kaveh places the diadem on the stand to complete the final round, an image of Sachin materialized.

Sachin's explanation of his research upset Kaveh, so he threw the Diadem of Knowledge to the ground, dramatically breaking it into pieces after it had survived for an indefinitely long time intact. After the Diadem of Knowledge was broken, the image of Sachin dissipated.<ref name="to claim the crown" /> When Kaveh talks about the crown's effects, he says it was like it was brainwashing him. According to Alhaitham, the crown appears to only have adverse effects on empaths and idealists who can understand Sachin's ideas, explaining why he was able to interact with Sachin's research and Layla and Wanderer were able to interact with the crown normally, whereas Kaveh, who is both of these things, experienced pain.

It is unknown what happened to the fragments of the Diadem of Knowledge, but they are presumably in the care of the Akademiya due to the value of the crown and the secret of the crown being exposed. However, Dori implies that the destroyed crown is now worthless.
