==Description==
A jade piece which, despite its exquisite packaging, has been placed in one of the least prominent positions in the store.<br />
The box comes with an official-looking certificate of premium quality, issued by an organization that no one has ever heard of.<br />
To the untrained eye, the luxurious packaging and accessories would probably be enough to lure one in.<br />
However, it is still reasonable value for money when compared with genuine top-quality jade pieces.
