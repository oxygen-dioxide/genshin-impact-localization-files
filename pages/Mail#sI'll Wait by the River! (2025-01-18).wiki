|text      = I'm not letting those drunks at [[The Cat's Tail]] get even a whiff of any booze today! I've asked [[Margaret]] for a whole day off. Hmph, let them scratch their heads and go thirsty for once!

Even my tail is happily swishing back and forth now that I can't smell a drop of alcohol! Ahem, but that doesn't mean you can just go touching it, got it?

By the way, when was the last time you had fish? Grilled fish, pan-fried fish, or maybe fried fish... I'm still deciding how to cook them tonight. O&mdash;Of course, I've counted your portion! Eating more fish can also make your hair shinier, you know.

If... If you feel bad about it and want to help me catch some fish... I'll be waiting by the river! You can just use my fishing rod and bait.

As for me? Heh, I won't let a single fishy escape. Just keep your eyes peeled and watch me work my magic!
