{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tia:''' Hello. You must be from somewhere very far away.
:{{DIcon}} What's your name?
::'''Tia:''' My name is Tia. Landa's my father.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your father.
::'''Tia:''' My father says I should tell all strangers that he is a traveling merchant.
::'''Tia:''' Well if you were friends with Tia she could tell you!
::{{DIcon}} How does one make friends with you, then?
:::'''Tia:''' Easy, you just need to play with me.
:::'''Tia:''' But right now I'm playing with Richie and Wei!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Has traveling been fun?
:::'''Tia:''' Yup! This is my first time outside Mondstadt. Everything here is so cool!
:::'''Tia:''' When I was small, I could only read "[[Vera's Melancholy]]." I would imagine I was Vera, experiencing all kinds of amazing adventures!
:::'''Tia:''' I know! I'll give you this copy of "Vera's Melancholy." I might have flipped through it a bit too much...
:::'''Tia:''' But I don't need it anymore, because I'm on a real adventure with Daddy. My experiences will be even more interesting than the novel!

===Unreconciled Stars===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tia:''' Are dreams black, or white? Are they another world? I can never remember what happened in my dreams when I wake up.
:'''Tia:''' But everyone's saying that if you touch those strange stones, you'll sleep for a long, long time. If I dream for that long, I'll definitely remember my dream, right?
:;(Continue non-event dialogue)
{{Dialogue end}}

===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tia:''' *sigh* Why won't the grownups let us go up to the roof?
:'''Tia:''' There was a [[Qiqi|little girl]] just now who wanted to go up to the roof to see the fireworks, but that [[Baizhu|green-haired guy]] next to her wouldn't allow it...
:'''Tia:''' I heard that they had something else they needed to do...Well, I'm free right now, but [[Landa|Daddy]] still won't let me up on the roof! What's with that?
:;(Continue non-event dialogue)

==Trivia==
* Tia and Landa may be mentioned in [[Noelle]]'s [[Noelle/Lore#Character Story 2|second Character Story]]. The merchant in Noelle's story went to Mondstadt with plans to ruin their wine industry but ultimately fled the country with his family, a daughter, out of fear of Noelle's apparent ability to read his mind &mdash; which was really just an extension of her dutiful nature.
* Tia has a message on the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]].
