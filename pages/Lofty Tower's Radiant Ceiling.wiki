|description    = The standard ceiling of a lofty tower made from volcanic rocks of regular shape that have excellent structural integrity, along with anti-fouling and damp-proofing properties. They say that past artisans would glaze-seal stone slabs to ensure waxy and lustrous surfaces after processing. And before that sealing process, many slabs would be packaged in a [[phlogiston]] mold to be baked for a good long while. Once the slabs were retrieved, the remaining phlogiston mold for the ceiling would then take on the radiance that gives both the stone slabs processed in it and the material used to make the ceiling their names.
