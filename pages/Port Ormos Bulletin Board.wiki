===An Argument===
:'''Message:''' "This is embarrassing to say. We were workers that maintain merchant ships here, living off the maintenance skills passed down from generation to generation."
:'''Message:''' "But some time ago, new technologies have been added to the Akasha, and our years of experience have become worthless. Young people can still learn through the Akasha, but old stuff like us have no choice but to change jobs."
:'''Message:''' "[[Alhaitham|The Scribe]] said we can go to sea and try our luck, but we have no money for something like that right now. If you have any gigs, please come to us."
:'''[[Kaveh|Another Person's Message]]:''' "Don't listen to the Scribe. I happen to know a big client who needs craftsmen. I'll introduce you to her. Take the money too. Forget about going to sea."
:'''Reply:''' "I wish you could do less meaningless things. Some people will succeed and some will fall, that's how the world works. Why interfere with it just to act like a goody-two-shoes?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Here the Scribe goes again with the mysticism. Why did I do this, you say? Because it makes me happy!"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "And don't you forget that mutual assistance, fairness, and righteous anger are also what drive the world, not nonsense like 'the fittest survives'!"
:'''Reply:''' "Make no mistake. I have never denied what you meant, but you don't understand what I am saying to you at all. End of conversation."
:'''Reply:''' "It's a headache to argue with the impulsive. Anyway, where's your own budget? Don't tell me you're spending all your [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] subsidies on such nonsense."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "The poor suffer from the rich's wealth. Thus the rich should give away their wealth for a good purpose.' says the sage [[Zolfikar]].
:'''Reply:''' "He never said that."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "He did."
:'''Reply:''' "No, he never said that. And you'll pay for your drinks this month."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I won't argue with you about this. But give me a month. I'll prove that he said it."

===Trading Company Advertisement===
:'''Trading Company Advertisement:''' "Our company has opened the route to [[Dornman Port]]. We sincerely invite you to join our fruit business.
:'''Message:''' "Wait a minute. Is it even possible to import fruit from [[Mondstadt]], given the long voyage? I might be interested if you're talking about liquor."
:'''Reply:''' "Everyone knows importing wine from Mondstadt is a business, but importing fruit? Only I do such business here. That's why this is such a great business opportunity!"
:'''Reply:''' "And you don't actually need to import from Mondstadt..."

===Cyno===
:'''Message:''' "The burden on me gets heavier since [[Cyno]] became a General Mahamatra, but it's actually more relieving since I don't have to deal with the tedious factionalism anymore."
:'''Message:''' "Or I couldn't be loitering around here while on a research trip."
:'''Message:''' "Don't know where Cyno has been. Guess I wouldn't get caught by him if I write it here."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I've seen it all. Report to me before tomorrow noon and receive punishment."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Don't waste my time."

:'''Message:''' "The Grand Bazaar is messed up by the Mahamata. We are maintaining a lot more Sumeru traditions and characters here instead."
:'''Message:''' "But, of course, if you want to watch a dancing performance, you still have to go to [[Zubayr Theater]], though."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Peasants. The Sumeru City was built with a delicate plan by researchers. The zoning and planning of each and every area here are backed up by scientific research."

:'''Message:''' "If I failed the exam again this year, I'm gonna have to return home and be a farmer. Don't know if I can take some '[[Anahitian Blessing]]' with me then..."

===Mahamata===
:'''Message:''' "These Mahamata they sent are each more useless than the last. They can't answer a single question that I ask."
:'''Message:''' "And now that we have access to the Akasha, these amateur Mahamata are not even at my level."
:'''Message:''' "That Scribe we don't see very often who helped sort out the shipping schedule last time is the only exception. Seems the Akademiya are not all dim-wits."
