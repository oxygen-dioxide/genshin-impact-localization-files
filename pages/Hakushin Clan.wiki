The {{Lang|'''Hakushin Clan'''|ja=白辰一族|ja_rm=Hakushin Ichizoku|ja_lit=White Dawn Family<!--<ref group="Note" name="shin" />-->}} is a prominent [[kitsune]] clan in [[Inazuma]] that managed the shrines around [[Mt. Yougou]]. It takes its name after its matriarch, [[Hakushin]].

==History==
Little is currently known about the Hakushin Clan, but they were evidently very influential in Inazuma. The [[Kitsune Saiguu]], a descendant of the clan matriarch [[Hakushin]], was worshipped as a kitsune goddess. [[Yae Miko]] is also said to be related to the Hakushin Clan by blood.<ref name="NCotSK5">{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|5}}</ref> Hakushin had six apprentices, one of which was "Black Fox" [[Itaru]]. However, it is unclear whether her apprentices were tied to the clan by blood.

The Hakushin Lands are located at the base of [[Mt. Yougou]]. After the Kitsune Saiguu's death, the shrine and the surrounding area were left abandoned.<ref name="NCotSK5" /> Many years after the [[cataclysm]] which claimed her life, [[Kamuna Harunosuke]] and [[Hanachirusato]] briefly returned to the area to perform a [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]]. In the present, Yae Miko and the shrine maidens at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] were making preparations to hold a Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual when the [[Traveler]] appeared, and Yae Miko instead left the completion of the ritual to them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sacrificial Offering}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Inagi Hotomi}}</ref> Miko also takes the Traveler to the area for her Anti-Raiden Shogun Training program.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Servant's Path}}</ref>

[[Ioroi]] mentions that the comb he stole from the Sky Kitsune Statue in [[Chinju Forest]] contains the Hakushin symbol.<ref name="Tanuki-Bayashi">{{Ref/Quest|Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*The clan is most likely a reference to Japanese divine fox spirits called {{Lang|''byakko''|ja=白狐|ja_tl=white foxes}}. They are believed to be the messengers of the Buddhist goddess {{w|Dakini}} (also called the ''Byakushin-Ko'ou'' or ''Hakushin-Ko'ou'') and her Shinto manifestation {{w|Inari Ōkami|Inari Oomikami}}.
**Considering the above etymology, [[Byakko Plain]] is probably named after the Hakushin Clan.
