==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ashk:''' No matter how far up you may climb, you still can't touch the sky...
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Ashk:''' Hello. Hardly anyone comes around here. Are you here to stargaze?
::'''Ashk:''' The untouchable sky conceals the truth about the world... At least, that's what we [[Rtawahist]]s believe.
::'''Ashk:''' But the mortal sight is limited. Who can guarantee that they can see all the celestial signs clearly?
::'''Ashk:''' How about you, what do you think?
::{{DIcon}} The stars determine your destiny...
::;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::'''Ashk:''' Ah, are you talking about the research on constellations?
:::'''Ashk:''' Unfortunately, I don't have a [[Vision]], so I couldn't participate in those research projects.
:::'''Ashk:''' But I feel the stars don't "decide" your destiny so much as they "show" it.
:::'''Ashk:''' Because if it was decided, then it could be changed, right?
:::'''Ashk:''' If destiny could be changed, maybe [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] wouldn't have met her end.
::{{DIcon}} The stars determine your destiny...
::;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Ashk:''' Ah, are you talking about the research on constellations?
:::'''Ashk:''' Unfortunately, I don't have a Vision, so I couldn't participate in those research projects.
:::'''Ashk:''' But I feel the stars don't "decide" your destiny so much as they "show" it.
:::'''Ashk:''' Because if such things can be "decided", then they can also be "changed", right?
:::'''Ashk:''' If destiny could be rewritten just like that, I doubt that the Dendro Archon would have had to expend so much energy quelling the ancient calamity back then.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Things might not be as they seem...
:::'''Ashk:''' You're right. People can be easily distracted or deceived.
:::'''Ashk:''' If I were a [[matra]], I might tell you that ignorance is also a blessing.
:::'''Ashk:''' But people's ignorance will not affect the existence of truth. Sometimes blindness...
:::'''Ashk:''' Oh, I may have said too much. Just ignore my words and let it go with the wind.
::; (Obtain 4{{Star}} [[Labyrinth Wayfarer]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Let me give it more thought...
::'''Ashk:''' Yeah.
