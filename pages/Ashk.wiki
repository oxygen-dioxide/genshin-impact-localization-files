==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ashk:''' No matter how far up you may climb, you still can't touch the sky...
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Ashk:''' Hello. Hardly anyone comes around here. Are you here to stargaze?
::'''Ashk:''' The untouchable sky conceals the truth about the world... At least, that's what we [[Rtawahist]]s believe.
::'''Ashk:''' But the mortal sight is limited. Who can guarantee that they can see all the celestial signs clearly?
::'''Ashk:''' How about you, what do you think?
::{{DIcon}} The stars determine your destiny...
::;(Before completing ''[[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]]'')
::::'''Ashk:''' Ah, are you talking about the research on constellations?
::::'''Ashk:''' Unfortunately, I don't have a [[Vision]], so I couldn't participate in those research projects.
::::'''Ashk:''' But I feel the stars don't "decide" your destiny so much as they "show" it.
::::'''Ashk:''' Because if it was decided, then it could be changed, right?
::::'''Ashk:''' If destiny could be changed, maybe [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] wouldn't have met her end.
::;(After completing ''Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies'')
::::'''Ashk:''' Ah, are you talking about the research into constellations?
::::'''Ashk:''' Unfortunately, I don't have a Vision, so I couldn't participate in those research projects.
::::'''Ashk:''' But I feel that the stars don't "decide" your destiny so much as they "show" it.
::::'''Ashk:''' Because if such things can be "decided," then they can also be "changed," right?
::::'''Ashk:''' If destiny could be rewritten just like that, I doubt that the Dendro Archon would have had to expend so much energy quelling the ancient calamity back then.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Things might not be as they seem...
:::'''Ashk:''' You're right. People can be easily distracted or deceived.
:::'''Ashk:''' If I were a [[matra]], I might tell you that ignorance is also a blessing.
:::'''Ashk:''' But people's ignorance will not affect the existence of truth. Sometimes blindness...
:::'''Ashk:''' Oh, I may have said too much. Just ignore my words and let it go with the wind.
::;(Obtain 4{{Star}} {{Item|Labyrinth Wayfarer}})
:{{DIcon}} Let me give it more thought...
::'''Ashk:''' Yeah.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===A Parade of Providence===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ashk:''' It's said that you can see pretty far if you stand high, but the higher you go, the harder it is to see what's right beneath you...
:'''Ashk:''' Ah, sorry. I was talking to myself.
:'''Ashk:''' If you're looking to join the Akademiya Extravaganza, then you probably got lost to wander this far. You're way past the boundaries of the festivities.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ashk:''' You can still hear the hustle and bustle of the market, even from this high up...
:'''Ashk:''' Haha, seems like joy is just like Sabzeruz Festival candies &mdash; being cast in every direction!
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:;(Same as [[#Dialogue|above]])
:{{DIcon}} Let me give it more thought...
