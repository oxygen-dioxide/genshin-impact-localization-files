The {{Lang|'''Wangsheng Funeral Parlor'''|zh=往生堂|zh_rm=Wǎngshēng-táng}} is a business based in [[Liyue Harbor]]. Along with burying the dead, they also perform funeral rites for [[adepti]].

The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has ties to the [[Fatui]], and according to [[Tartaglia|Childe]], they "ostensibly" do not conduct in shady backroom deals like assassination.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Organization Known as Wangsheng}}</ref>

The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor was originally founded during or after the [[Archon War]], when the fallen gods manifested demons that prompted [[Rex Lapis]] to send the [[Yaksha]] to protect Liyue. Since then, it has existed for 77 generations.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/2dcaQiLBqEo Collected Miscellany - "Hu Tao: Fragrance in Thaw"]</ref> Over time, the Yaksha accumulated massive amounts of negative karma, some of which manifested into a plague that swept through Liyue, killing many in its path. Paranoid people believed it to be a curse from the gods, but a few realized that the plague could be contained by purifying the air and burning infected corpses. These people pioneered a new path and eventually founded the parlor. They and their successors would tirelessly maintain the balance between life and death.

It was originally more of a doctor's office than the funeral services that it is known for today.

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before starting Yet the Butterfly Flutters Away)
:'''Examine Board:''' (Seems like there's a board outside Wangsheng Funeral Parlor with lots of blank wooden tiles hanging from it... Hmm... what are they for?)
:'''Examine Board:''' (Never mind, I'm not sure I want to find out.)

;(Examine the board while Hu Tao is coming up with a business plan)
:'''Examine Board:''' (A board used for hanging Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's wooden tiles. According to Hu Tao, all the tiles should be blank...)
:'''Examine Board:''' (...In which case, the characters on the back of the tiles must be the "special offer.")

;(Examine the board after Hu Tao concocts her business plan)
:'''Examine Board:''' (A board outside Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Clients use the wooden tiles to write down their commissions, before sliding them under the crack of the door.)
:'''Examine Board:''' (Hu Tao's advertisements can be found on the back of each tile: "Buy one get free for the holder of this tile.")
