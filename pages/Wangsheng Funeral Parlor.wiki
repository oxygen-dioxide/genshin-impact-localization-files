==Lore==
The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor was originally founded during or after the [[Archon War]], when the fallen gods manifested demons that prompted [[Rex Lapis]] to send the [[Yaksha]] to protect Liyue. Since then, it has existed for 77 generations.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/2dcaQiLBqEo Collected Miscellany - "Hu Tao: Fragrance in Thaw"]</ref> Over time, the Yaksha accumulated massive amounts of negative karma, some of which manifested into a plague that swept through Liyue, killing many in its path. Paranoid people believed it to be a curse from the gods, but a few realized that the plague could be contained by purifying the air and burning infected corpses. These people pioneered a new path and eventually founded the parlor. They and their successors would tirelessly maintain the balance between life and death. The [[Hu Family]] currently owns and operates the parlor.

At some point after the Archon War, after the Lone Butterfly of the Crimson Flame sacrificed herself to conduct the [[Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method]] to purify [[Tao Dou]], another of the [[Eight Adepts]]s, the Wuwang Kid, took up her mantle and taught the arts to the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.

It was originally more of a doctor's office in its start, but gradually evolved to a funeral parlor over time. Outside of conducting funerals, the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is also responsible for maintaining the balance between life and death in Liyue, such as monitoring its "border" to ensure death does not spill out from it, and eliminating growths of [[fetor]] that may manifest inside. 

Ten years prior to the Traveler's arrival in Teyvat, the 75th and 76th directors of the parlor, Old Hu and Hu Tao's father, attempted to purge a fetor growth that had grown out of control in [[Wuwang Hill]]. Hu Tao's father slipped at the last moment, causing devastation to the surrounding area and dying in the process. Old Hu managed to contain his son's mistake, but the amount of fetor he accumulated resulted in his death soon afterwards, resulting in Hu Tao succeeding them as the current director of the parlor.
