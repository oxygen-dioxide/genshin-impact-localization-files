}}
'''Paimon''' is an [[NPC]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' who accompanies the [[Traveler]] throughout their adventure in [[Teyvat]] as their guide. She met the Traveler by being fished out of a lake in which she mentions she would've drowned if the Traveler didn't save her.

She is currently representing ''Genshin Impact'' as its mascot and is used as the icon for the game, its official website, and various social media accounts.

==Profile==
===Personality===
Paimon is bubbly, out-going, but almost a little too honest, somewhat naïve and occasionally comes off as rude. She is obvious about who she likes and who she doesn't like, giving "ugly nicknames" to those who annoy her, frequently calling [[Venti]] the "Tone-Deaf Bard." She stands by what she thinks and tends to refer to herself from a third-person point of view.

She loves eating; despite her small size, she can wolf down large amounts of food before feeling full. She is also well versed in the history behind many dishes. While she enjoys slime products, she also states that her worst nightmare is being eaten by a particularly large slime.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About Nightmares}}</ref> Paimon also has great enthusiasm for rare treasure and [[Mora]].

In contrast to her usual loud and immature demeanour, she shows a very different side of herself while helping the Traveler take care of Kichiboushi, where her mentoring role is compared to like a big sister or mother. In particular she has the idea to present Dvalin's tale to the tanuki and handles most of the telling and moral guidance entirely on her own. 

Paimon also has extensive knowledge about the world of [[Teyvat]], acting as the Traveler's guide to the world after they fish her out of the water.

===Appearance===
Paimon has a petite body, giving her the look of a fairy. She has thick white hair cropped just above her shoulders, dark purple eyes, and light skin.

She wears a long-sleeved white jumper and a night-blue cape flecked with stars, and white stockings with white boots. Rose-gold embroidery and shapes are attached to her jumper, boots, and sleeves.

Paimon's accessories are a dark blue hairpin, almost black, and a rose-gold crown that levitates above her head as though it was a halo.

==Trivia==
*During the Closed Beta Tests, Paimon was used as a spokesperson, replying to the questions and suggestions that were asked on the official Facebook page.
*It is hinted that she cannot swim, though when swimming in-game in water, she floats above you just over the water.
*A recurring gag in the game is calling Paimon "Emergency Food."
**The first instance of this can be found in the Prologue quest [[Wind-Riding Knight]], where the Traveler, during their first meeting with Amber, has the option of introducing Paimon as "Emergency Food".
**While having a conversation with [[Little Xing]], Little Xing questions if Paimon is "some kind of food?"
*Paimon's role as the mascot of Genshin Impact is similar to [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Ai-Chan|Ai-Chan]], the mascot for Honkai Impact 3rd, another of HoYoverse's games.
*One of the [[Traveler]]'s voice lines jokingly suggests that Paimon has more than one stomach, where one of them is made specifically for liquids.
*[[Verr Goldet]], the boss of the [[Wangshu Inn]], describes Paimon as a "floating elf companion". Notably, she is one of the few characters who remarks on Paimon's appearance - others tend to refer to her as a "mysterious flying pet" or some other similar term.
**The term Verr Goldet uses in Chinese is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=精灵|zh_rm=jīng​líng}}, which broadly refers to fantastical creatures like elves, fairies, and spirits. This term has also been used to describe [[Barbatos]]' original form before becoming an [[Archon]], [[Klee]] and [[Alice]]'s race, and the [[Lochfolk]].
**The [[Starsnatcher]] describes Paimon as "talking fairy", or "talking [[mini Seelie]]" ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=会说话的小仙灵|zh_rm=}}) in Chinese, though Paimon is confused by this remark about her.
*The symbol on Paimon's clothing is an upside-down triquetra, one of the prominent [[symbols in Teyvat]]. She also bears the Celestial motif on her sleeves and boots.
**Paimon's headpiece shares design elements with a fully-upgraded [[Statue of The Seven]]. The ring that forms around the statue at Level 10 has the same design as the ring that forms the base of her headpiece, while the vertical protrusion on her headpiece is a simplified version of the diamond-shaped leaf motif that appears upon upgrading the statue to Level 6.
*Paimon represents some parts of the gameplay system in ''Genshin Impact''.
** HoYoverse's official announcement and developer messages are sent by "P·A·I·M·O·N" in the [[mail|mail system]]. This is different from [[Birthday/Paimon|Paimon's own mail]], which is signed simply as "Paimon."
**The pause menu is called the "[[Paimon Menu]]," and is indicated in-game by an icon resembling Paimon's head.
* She shares the same birthday as [[Arataki Itto]], June 1, International Day for Protection of Children, a widely celebrated holiday for children in countries such as Armenia, Burma, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Russia, and Portugal. In some countries, it's a national holiday and fairs will be hosted for children; them sharing their birthdays on this date might relate to their childlike nature and soft spot for children.
* While mostly absent from Hangout Events, she does make an appearance in:
** Barbara's Hangout Event: [[Wellspring of Healing]]
** Noelle's Hangout Event: [[Chivalric Training]]
** Bennett's Hangout Event: [[Fantastic Voyage (Hangout Event)|Fantastic Voyage]]
** Shikanoin Heizou's Hangout Event: [[Trap 'Em by Storm]]
* Paimon is mentioned in the descriptions of several Furnishing items:
** [[Azure Crane]]
** [[Black-Back Hound]]
** [[Forest Boar]]
** [[Inazuman Official Residence: Forcefulness]]
** [[Inazuman Walled House: Refined Estate]]
** [[Liyue Estate: Exquisite Mansion]]
** [[Portable Stove]]
** [[Veranda Corner: Pavilion's Watch]]
* Paimon's exchange with [[Venti]] from Act II of [[For a Tomorrow Without Tears]] of her responding to Venti's "Hehe." with "What do you mean 'hehe'?" has been alluded to twice in the story, thus far. Once during [[Date's Challenge]] with [[Date]] responding to Paimon with "What do you mean 'hehe'?!", and another as Traveler's response to the Paimon during [[Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Two Cities' Recommendations]].
* Paimon is known by these aliases:
** Emergency Food (by [[Traveler]])
** Floating elf companion (by [[Verr Goldet]])
** Floating child (by [[Albedo]])
** Little one (by [[Arataki Itto]])
** Flying Lavender Melon (by Arataki Itto)
** White Fur (by [[Kichiboushi]])
** Byemon (by Kichiboushi)
** Spymon (by Kichiboushi)
** Paimore (by Kichiboushi)
** Human hatchling (by [[Tsumi]])
** Two-legged hatchling (by [[Xamaran]])
** Little One (by [[Urakusai]])
** My Little Helper (by [[Yae Miko]])
** Your Most Eminent Flying Companion (by [[Yanbo]])
** Lady Paimon (by [[Fischl]])
**Talking Adeptal Fruit (by [[Tu]])
* In the start of the game, the Traveler saved Paimon by fishing her out of water, even though fishing wasn't released until [[Version/2.1|Version 2.1]].
* Despite her omnipresence in marketing and player communication, Paimon is something of an enigma with regards to the plot and Teyvat as nothing about her prior to being fished out of the water is known, or even about her basic nature.
*Paimon's nickname, Flying Lavender Melon, given to her by Itto in the [[Archon Quest]]: [[Perilous Trail]] is referenced in the [[Heizou Talks Fraud#Ending: The Three Undeceivables|The Three Undeceivables]] ending of Heizou's Hang Out Quest quote.
