'''Paimon''' is the deuteragonist of ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. She is an [[NPC]] who accompanies the [[Traveler]] throughout their adventure in [[Teyvat]] as their guide. She met the Traveler when the latter fished her out of a lake, after which she mentions she would have drowned if not saved by the Traveler.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wanderer's Trail}}</ref>

She is currently representing ''Genshin Impact'' as its mascot and is used as the icon for the game, its official website, and various social media accounts.

==Profile==
===Personality===
Paimon is bubbly, outgoing, but almost a little too honest, somewhat naïve, and occasionally comes off as rude. She is obvious about who she likes and who she doesn't like, giving "ugly nicknames" to those who annoy her, frequently calling [[Venti]] the "Tone-Deaf Bard." She stands by what she thinks and tends to refer to herself from a third-person point of view.

She loves eating; despite her small size, she can wolf down large amounts of food before feeling full. She is also well versed in the history behind many dishes. While she enjoys slime products, she also states that her worst nightmare is being eaten by a particularly large slime.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About Nightmares}}</ref> Paimon also has great enthusiasm for rare treasure and [[Mora]].

In contrast to her usual loud and immature demeanor, she shows a different side of herself while helping the Traveler take care of [[Kichiboushi]], where her mentoring role is compared to like a big sister or mother. In particular, she decides to present Dvalin's tale to Kichiboushi and handles most of the storytelling and moral guidance entirely on her own.

Despite occasionally bantering with the Traveler, Paimon is quite attached to them and is shown to be fiercely loyal. She always sticks by their side no matter the danger and tries to keep them on their feet, including against overwhelming odds like [[Archon]]s or the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]. She becomes anxious whenever the Traveler seemingly disappears or is separated from her. Paimon has also revealed that her biggest wish is for the Traveler's wish to come true, and has sworn to stay by their side.

She also has extensive knowledge regarding the world of Teyvat, acting as the Traveler's guide to the world after they fish her out of the water.

===Appearance===
Paimon has a petite body, giving her the look of a fairy. She has thick white hair cropped just above her shoulders, dark purple eyes, and light skin. In some official art, the tip of one of her front hair locks fades to black.

She wears a long-sleeved white jumper and a night-blue cape flecked with stars, and white stockings with white boots. Rose-gold embroidery and shapes are attached to her jumper, boots, and sleeves.

Paimon's accessories are a dark blue hairpin, almost black, and a rose-gold tiara that levitates above her head as though it was a halo.

==Trivia==
* A recurring gag in the game is calling Paimon "Emergency Food."
** The first instance of this can be found in {{Quest|Wind-Riding Knight|showType=0}}, where the Traveler, during their first meeting with [[Amber]], has the option of introducing Paimon as "Emergency Food."
** While having a conversation with [[Little Xing]], Little Xing questions if Paimon is "some kind of food?"
** During {{Quest|Friendship in Writing}}, the Traveler is tasked with forming ideas for a short novel based on their travels. For the novel's first chapter, one of the options is "Reincarnated in Another World: Encounters with Airborne Emergency Rations."
* [[Verr Goldet]], the boss of [[Wangshu Inn]], describes Paimon as a "floating elf companion." Notably, she is one of the few characters who remarks on Paimon's appearance &mdash; others tend to refer to her as a "mysterious flying pet" or some other similar term.
** The term Verr Goldet uses in Chinese is {{zh|精灵|rm=jīng​líng}}, which broadly refers to fantastical creatures like elves, fairies, and spirits. This term has also been used to describe [[Barbatos]]' original form before becoming an [[Archon]], [[Klee]] and [[Alice]]'s race, and the [[Lochfolk]].
** [[Starsnatcher]] describes Paimon as "talking fairy," or "talking [[mini Seelie]]" ({{zh|会说话的小仙灵|rm=}}) in Chinese, though Paimon is confused by this remark about her.
* Paimon's exchange with Venti in {{Quest|State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel|showType=0}}, where she responds to Venti's "Hehe." with "What do you mean 'hehe'?", has been alluded to twice in the story thus far. Once was during the {{Quest|Date's Challenge}} with [[Date]] responding to Paimon with "What do you mean 'hehe'?!", and another was the Traveler's response to Paimon during {{Quest|Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Two Cities' Recommendations|showType=0}}.
* During the Closed Beta Tests, Paimon was used as a spokesperson, replying to the questions and suggestions on the official Facebook page.
* In the image used to announce the end of [[Version/0.0.1|CBT1]], Paimon is featured with an unknown staff alongside her.
* Paimon's role as the mascot of Genshin Impact is similar to [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Ai-Chan|Ai-Chan]], the mascot for Honkai Impact 3rd, another of HoYoverse's games.
* Paimon represents some parts of the gameplay system in ''Genshin Impact''.
** HoYoverse's official announcement and developer messages are sent by "P·A·I·M·O·N" in the [[mail|mail system]]. This is different from [[Birthday/Paimon|Paimon's own mail]], which is signed simply as "Paimon."
** The pause menu is called the "[[Paimon Menu]]," and is indicated in-game by an icon resembling Paimon's head.
* Despite her omnipresence in marketing and player communication, Paimon is something of an enigma with regards to the plot and Teyvat as nothing about her prior to being fished out of the water is known, or even about her basic nature.
** Paimon appears to be resistant to certain phenomena which would otherwise require a [[Vision]] or elemental affinity, such as the contaminated region of [[Avidya Forest]] in {{Quest|The Unanswerable Problems}}.
* Despite the Traveler fishing Paimon out of the water at the beginning of the game, [[fishing]] was not released until [[Version 2.1]].
* It is hinted that Paimon cannot swim.
** During ''[[Bird's Eye View]]'', when the Traveler swims to the island in [[Starfell Lake]], she floats above them just over the water.
* Paimon claims to be "the god of protection," her reasoning being that she considers herself the Traveler's bodyguard.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About the Rain on Yashiori Island}}</ref>
* It is jokingly suggested that Paimon has more than one stomach, where one of them specifically contains liquids.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About Cider Lake}}</ref>
* From [[Version 3.1]] onwards, when players open the Paimon Menu, they can blow on their PS5 controller's microphone to change Paimon's idle animation. When done enough times, this elicits a comment from Paimon wondering where the "wind" came from, and repeating this in Version 3.2 will eventually have Paimon call you out.
* The symbol on Paimon's clothing is an upside-down triquetra, one of the prominent [[symbols in Teyvat]]. She also bears the celestial motif on her sleeves and boots.
** Paimon's headpiece shares design elements with a fully-upgraded [[Statue of The Seven]]. The ring that forms around the statue at Level 10 has the same design as the ring that forms the base of her headpiece, while the vertical protrusion on her headpiece is a simplified version of the diamond-shaped leaf motif that appears upon upgrading the statue to Level 6.
* She shares the same birthday as [[Arataki Itto]], June 1, International Day for Protection of Children, a widely celebrated holiday for children in countries such as Armenia, Burma, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Russia, and Portugal. In some countries, it's a national holiday and fairs will be hosted for children; them sharing their birthdays on this date might relate to their childlike nature and soft spot for children.
* While mostly absent from [[Hangout Event]]s, she does make an appearance in:
** [[Barbara]]'s Hangout Event: [[Wellspring of Healing]]
** [[Noelle]]'s Hangout Event: [[Chivalric Training]]
** [[Bennett]]'s Hangout Event: [[Fantastic Voyage (Hangout Event)|Fantastic Voyage]]
** [[Shikanoin Heizou]]'s Hangout Event: [[Trap 'Em by Storm]]

** Floating child (by [[Albedo]])
** Little one (by [[Arataki Itto]])
