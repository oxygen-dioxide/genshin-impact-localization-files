:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' [[Mizuki]]! Mizuki! [[Amina]] just told me some amazing news!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Thanks to the party, the [[People of the Springs]] had forty percent more visitors than normal! And to think, we barely did anything to promote it!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That's great! I also have some good news... Over the past few days, the number of patients at my practice has dropped by ninety percent!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' If our goal was to lift people's spirits and give them a space to let go of their worries, I think we can safely say... That's a job well done!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Haha, then let's go even bigger next time! Add even more games!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That way, there's something for everyone &mdash; hot springs if you want relaxation, games if you want fun... As far as vacations go, you can't get much better than that!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! [[Mualani]]! Mizuki!
:{{DIcon}} The musical genius has returned!
:{{DIcon}} Two happy visitors here to give you a five-star review!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, say no more! It's written all over your face! You had a blast, didn't you?
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you kidding!? An all-you-can-eat, self-serve buffet? Paimon was on cloud nine! She had five servings of [[Hot Spring O'Clock]]!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And {{Traveler}} was even more obsessed with the Rhythm Ball than Paimon with the free food!
:{{DIcon}} Ehe.
:{{DIcon}} No, no, no. Nothing can compare to your obsession with food!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Honestly, watching you play was quite the spectacle! An expert performance if I ever saw one!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You should help me brainstorm the next time we host something like this! We can come up with even more fun games!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' As far as I know, that does seem to be one of {{Traveler}}'s many talents.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I look forward to working with you again, Miss Mualani. Although, it would be easier if you had a designated office space... Why don't I help you open a consultancy?
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Ooh, I like the sound of that! Let me ask around! If there's space... We could put it right next to your clinic!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Good idea! I'd love nothing more than to be neighbors.
:{{DIcon}} Man, I want to live here, too!
:{{DIcon}} More time in the People of the Springs... Count us in!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, all-you-can-eat buffets and hot springs every day... Oh yeah, that sounds like the life, hehe...
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, if you had a permanent address, it would be easier to track you down if we need something.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Never knew the day would come when I'd sound like one of my clients.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, [[Xilonen]]!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The music you picked for Rhythm Ball was excellent! Every time we played the game, we would start dancing before we knew it!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Glad to hear it.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' From what I've observed over the past few days, you have great potential as "fusion" artists.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It could be because you've encountered music from all sorts of different cultures. When you're immersed in the melody, it's almost like you can incorporate different beats on instinct.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The most cutting-edge music often involves some form of "fusion." So, I have a feeling I'll be coming to you for inspiration one day.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Here, I want you to have this. Give it a listen sometime.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it?

::'''Xilonen's Note'''
::[[File:Item Fusion Profusion DJ Remix Selections Image.png|400px]]
::According to my observations, musical styles on the cutting edge of theory tend to lean toward fusion, absorbing elements from multiple perspectives that are in tension with one another, such as composition, instrumentation, and tone, through which composers of such music make breakthroughs and find new ways to improve. Traditional musical styles never had clear boundaries in the first place, and those are blurring ever further...
::Reaching the pinnacle of one's music and technique is an admirable deed, but for creators who have yet to attain the level of a "master for life" and ordinary audiences both, sticking to a single style is not wise, if one wishes to improve one's musical appreciation and creativity.
::Technology and human ears all have limits, and it would undoubtedly be a pity to stray into territory that no one can follow you into, chasing after complex or unpopular harmonies, or developing machine-esque performance techniques.
::So yeah, I hope you'll enjoy the songs on this disc. Even if you don't intend to create any music, it'd be great to introduce yourself to a few new styles and discover new, moving melodies.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' No way! One of Xilonen's mixtapes! At [[Xochicuicatl Records]], that would sell in a heartbeat!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Ah, yes. Not everyone can get their hands on the records or equipment Miss Xilonen recommends. It's a source of anxiety for some people. I once treated a patient for that very reason...
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' ...You can treat even that, Miss Mizuki?
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' All I did was help her manage her emotions. I told her to consider getting a job at the record store. Then, she would be one of the first to get information on your latest recommendations.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hah, good idea... I just hope she can keep it to herself, or job applications are about to become just as hard to snag...
:{{DIcon}} Well, thanks for this.
:{{DIcon}} I'll give it a good listen.
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Paimon can't wait to hear it!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Next time, we'll help you come up with an even better game... With music that's just as amazing as this time, of course!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's a promise! People won't know what hit 'em!
:{{A|vo dyfk002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Man, the party isn't even over, and Paimon already can't wait for the next one! The People of the Springs really know how to live it up...
