|vo_13_03_tx         = The final stage of my journey, or Kaiden, is the study of the most profound techniques. Unavoidably, these draw heavily on elemental power, rendering them beyond the capabilities of most mortals. Most practitioners of other traditions are unable to ever reach this level.

Well, what I can say on this topic is subject to certain constraints, but... it is not by my will that Visions are granted or denied.

Still, I have to admit that I was a little upset to become the target of her scheming myself. I know it was for my own good, but I'm afraid she will mock me next time we meet...

The fury of the Pyro Archon... that was said to be the cause. Now, I have the opportunity to meet that human once again... Perhaps you could introduce me? We are both warriors.

At that time, [[Makoto|she]] was preoccupied with various domestic matters within the island, so as her kagemusha, I assumed her identity and joined the troops dispatched to pacify Watatsumi.
