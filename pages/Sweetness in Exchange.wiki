|description    = A common stall made from [[Karmaphala Wood]], which has outstanding moisture-proofing properties. This stall is suitable for the sales of the freshest fruits and vegetables.<br />Fruits and vegetables are typical time-sensitive commodities. The timing at which the fruits ripen and storage time greatly influence the fruit and vegetable business. "Ensuring the effective flow of TSC (Time-Sensitive Commodities)" is a research topic among [[Vahumana]] school's many social science studies. Based on relevant theories, Vahumana researchers have offered plenty of advice to fruit and vegetable vendors in the [[Grand Bazaar]], which effectively reduces the extra consumption and inevitable waste of commodities, thus saving a considerable amount of Mora for vendors and even the Grand Bazaar in general."
