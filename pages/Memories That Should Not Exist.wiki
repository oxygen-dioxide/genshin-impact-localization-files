{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continues from previous quest)
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second... That person, it's... Dainsleif!
:;(The group approaches Dainsleif as he takes out a few monsters)
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Ah, it's you two...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 atossa 01.ogg}} '''Atossa:''' Oh, a friend of yours?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 atossa 02.ogg}} '''Atossa:''' Well, I'll leave you all to it, then. I should head back to the village to check up on Chief Amadhiah and the others, anyway. See you later!
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! See you later, Atossa!
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why do you always have to pop up out of nowhere like that!? Is it your life's mission in life to jumpscare us or something?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' It's hardly personal... or intentional, for that matter. As long as you and I are both in pursuit of the Abyss Order, we're bound to cross paths.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so you're here to investigate the Abyss Order, then! That would explain the monsters you were fighting just now...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Naturally. Hold on... Are you not here for the same purpose?
:{{DIcon}} We're also on their tail...
:{{DIcon}} But, I'll admit, we ran into them on accident.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Hm, no matter. It may have taken you a while to catch on, but I'm sure you've also realized by now... That there's something strange about this place.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The Abyss Order is most certainly planning something in this area... or worse, their plan could already be in motion.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you think the Abyss Order is behind the Hilichurl activity in the area?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 06.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' As things stand, I highly doubt that is their primary motive. I would imagine the increased Hilichurl activity is merely a byproduct of whatever it is they're really trying to accomplish.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still, the Hilichurl activity is causing a lot of problems for the people here. We should stick around for a while and protect the village, don't you think?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 07.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The best way to protect them is by figuring out what the Abyss Order is truly planning. That is how we prevent further tragedy.
:{{DIcon}} Well, let's see what more we can learn from the villagers.
:{{DIcon}} And after that... You also owe us many answers.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 08.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' And you shall have them. I never intended to hide anything from you.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 09.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Don't worry... There should be ample time to talk.
:{{Black Screen|You return to Vimara Village to gather intel based on what you've learned. You question the villagers until, eventually, the sky grows dark...}}
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 10.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Ah, so that was the commission that brought you here to Vimara Village...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 11.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' "Someone who seems to only exist in people's memories"... That is indeed quite intriguing. I would agree that it's unlikely you have a simple missing person's case on your hands. However, any possible connection to the Abyss Order is still unclear.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 12.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' It appears all we have by way of clues is increased Hilichurl activity, and that is certainly not much to go off of.
:{{DIcon}} Well, then...
:{{DIcon}} How about the intel you promised me?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 07b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! That mysterious voice {{MC|m=he|f=she}} heard in {{MC|m=his sister|f=her brother}}'s memory... The one who called himself a Sinner... Who is he?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 13.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 14.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' {{Traveler}}, let me ask you this... Do you believe your sibling to have betrayed you?
:{{DIcon}} I want to have faith in {{MC|m=her|f=him}}.
:{{DIcon}} In a manner of speaking, yeah.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 15.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Hmm... I sense hesitation in your words. After all, you still haven't figured out the whole truth of what happened.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 16.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' There's still hope for the two of you to reconcile. Irreparable damage has not yet been done.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 17.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The Sinner you wish to know about... His situation is different. He and his fellow sinners have long betrayed me, and long betrayed their nation.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 18.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' His name is [[Vedrfolnir]], "The Visionary."
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 19.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I'm loath to admit it, but... He is also my kin. My older brother.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your... brother?
:{{DIcon}} What happened between the two of you?
:{{DIcon}} What really happened in Khaenri'ah back then?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 20.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' There were five of them... The Five Sinners of [[Khaenri'ah]].
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 21.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' "The Wise" [[Hroptatyr]], "The Visionary" Vedrfolnir, "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]], "The Foul" [[Surtalogi]], and "Rächer of Solnari" [[Rerir]].
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 22.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' No matter how eroded my memory may become, I will never forget their names... One day... I shall have my vengeance.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait! Some of those names sound really familiar... Rhinedottir is the one who created [[Albedo]], Surtalogi is [[Skirk]]'s master...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And the one we just learned about... Dain's brother, Vedrfolnir... If he was the voice of the Sinner, then the one who inspired [[Chlothar]] to create the Abyss Order... was him!
:{{DIcon}} Somehow, everything is connected...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (If that's true, then the stone slates we found in that ruin in Fontaine... The ones that outlined Fontaine's prophecy... That was likely Vedrfolnir's doing as well.)
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 23.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' They were once people of great esteem in Khaenri'ah, those who carried the hopes of the nation. They were the best of their peers, outstanding in their respective fields...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 24.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The six of us, together... We should have been the ones to prevent the disaster, the ones to stop the [[Vinster King]] from continuing to rock the foundation of the world.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 25.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Yet, deep within, the five of them craved something more. They could not resist the call of the Abyss, and divided among themselves a power that could destroy the world.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 26.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' So they became Sinners, but also transcendent beings, each in possession of world-shattering power.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 27.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' And when the cataclysm occurred, not one of them stood up in defense of their nation, not one came forward to prevent the tragedy... And for that, they shall never have my forgiveness.
:{{DIcon}} And then...
:{{DIcon}} My sibling came into contact with your brother.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 28.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...Indeed. If they are not stopped, the day is sure to come when they will also betray the entire world.
:{{DIcon}} It must be hard to talk about all of this.
:{{DIcon}} But thank you for telling me.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 29.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Of course. As I said, I never intended to hide anything from you.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, Dain, what have you been looking into all this time?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 30.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I've continued to investigate the questions surrounding the [[Loom of Fate]]. It's been quite some time since the initial operation was launched.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 31.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' By retrieving the eye of the first [[Field Tiller]], we were able to stop part of their plan from coming to fruition...

:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon remembers! Weren't they gonna use it to corrupt [[Osial]] and make a god or something...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 32.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Indeed... However, it's obvious that was just some kind of technical experiment...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 33.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The eye was integral to their plan, yet somehow, despite failing to obtain it, they've skipped the experimental phase and found some other way to keep moving forward.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 34.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' There are many signs pointing to that effect...
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, what should we do? It's not too late, is it?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 35.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Our most pressing concern... is to determine the purpose of the Loom of Fate. From there, we'll be able to deduce the Abyss Order's true objective.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 36.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Based on the intel I've gathered so far, I suspect the Loom of Fate is related to the [[Ley Line]]s in some way.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Ley Lines?
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 37.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' {{Traveler}}, you were able to observe your sibling's memories last time, yes? I believe that was due to the fact that the Ley Lines in that area were unstable.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 38.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' My recent investigation has shown that Abyss Order activity in a particular area is usually followed by a series of issues with the Ley Lines.
:{{DIcon}} And one of the things that flows through the Ley Lines... are memories.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, then our commission here in Vimara Village... The person who seems to exist only in people's memories... Could it be connected?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Memories... Ley Lines... The Loom of Fate... The missing person that doesn't seem to exist...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What's the connection between all this?)
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 dainsleif 39.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' It's certainly possible. I'll join your investigation tomorrow. This missing person's case could very well turn out to be the key to unraveling these mysteries.
:{{A|vo szaq302 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if we're teaming up with Dain again, we're gonna need all the energy we can get! Let's try investigating somewhere a little further away tomorrow.
:{{Color|menu|The night passes...}}
:{{A|vo szaq302 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn*... So tired... Paimon used way too much brain juice yesterday. It's all Dain's fault, saying all that complicated stuff...
:{{DIcon}} I didn't sleep well, either...
:{{DIcon}} My head's a mess.
:{{A|vo szaq302 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, let's go find Dain. We've got a lot to do today.

;(Approach Dainsleif)
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Dain? Hellooo... Dain! Why are you just zoning out over here?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did something happen?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong, Dain?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The missing person from your commission... Could you describe them to me?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Young guy, early twenties... Seriously, Dain... What's going on?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' There appear to be certain memories in my mind that weren't there before...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Memories... of him.
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Maybe... Maybe we just talked too much about him yesterday, and you had a weird dream or something?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' No. It wasn't a dream. They're memories... memories that suddenly appeared in my mind after I woke up...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 06.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' And I'm certain I've never met this person before.
:{{DIcon}} Well, what exactly did you "remember"?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 07.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I remember...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 08.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...Handing him the eye of the first Field Tiller.
:{{DIcon}} !?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whaaaat!?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Okay, so this missing person definitely has something to do with the Abyss Order, then...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 09.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Indeed. And it appears he possesses the ability to "implant" memories into the minds of others.
:{{DIcon}} How is that even possible...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, then... All the memories the villagers have of him... Could they be fake too? Maybe they never knew him at all...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But why would he do something like that...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 10.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Whatever the Abyss Order is planning, an important truth has been revealed to us this morning...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What sort of truth?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 11.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' That their goal... is still to obtain the eye of the first Field Tiller. They haven't stopped searching for it.
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 12.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I am the only person who knows its location. Perhaps implanting that particular memory was an attempt to interfere with my mind in some way...
:{{DIcon}} Is the eye still safe?
:{{DIcon}} What if that "memory" is real?
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 13.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Your concerns are not entirely unfounded. I don't believe the Abyss Order is capable of altering reality like that just yet...
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 14.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' However, considering their single-minded pursuit of the eye, I would say an equal level of caution is in order on our part.
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 15.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Come with me. We must check whether the eye is still in our possession.
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you're going to take us to where you hid it?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...But, what if someone follows us? If we go straight there, and someone is on our tail, aren't we just exposing the eye's location?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Maybe that's the reason the Abyss Order implanted that memory in the first place... To force Dain to confirm the eye's location...)
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 16.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Given what I know of him, though, I'm sure Dain has already thought of that possibility... It seems like he might already have a plan...)
:{{DIcon}} Let's go.
:{{DIcon}} Lead the way, Dain.
:{{A|vo szaq302 3 dainsleif 17.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...Of course.
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo szaq302 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you hid it way out here! Not an easy place to discover, that's for sure.
:{{A|vo szaq302 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, let's go check to see if it's safe!
:{{A|vo szaq302 4 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' {{Traveler}}, wait...
:{{DIcon}} Hm?
:{{A|vo szaq302 4 dainsleif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq302 4 dainsleif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...We've no time to lose. Let's head inside.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What was Dain going to tell me just now...)
:{{A|vo szaq302 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, wait up!
:;(Dainsleif dispels the barrier)
----
;(After defeating the enemies in the Domain)
:{{A|vo szaq302 5 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' It appears the mechanisms here have changed over time. You can access the upper floor through the side door. Perhaps you should try reactivating the mechanism over there.

;(Approach the door locked by runes)
:{{A|vo szaq302 6 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Make sure all the runes are pointing in the direction indicated by the light. That should unlock the mechanism.

;(After correctly positioning the runes)
:{{A|vo szaq302 7 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Ah, the door's open. Let's go. Our destination is just up ahead.

;(Approach the statues)
:{{A|vo szaq302 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like we can't go any further...
:{{A|vo szaq302 8 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Be on your guard. I sense the presence of the Abyss!
:{{A|vo szaq302 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's the Abyss Order! They're here!

;(After defeating the Abyss Herald)
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Just as I suspected... The false memories were a trap. The Abyss Order just wanted to follow us here...
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Now that they're in the vicinity, we should have a chance to see...
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Argh...!
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dain? What's wrong?
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Can you feel that? There's been a disturbance in the Ley Lines. It must be the work of the Abyss...
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, you must be really sensitive to that sort of thing. Paimon doesn't feel it...
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' You two, do as I say... Use that mechanism over there and leave this place.
:{{DIcon}} Leave you here on your own? Will you be alright?
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 06.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The Abyss Order is putting something in motion. If you return to Vimara Village, I suspect you might finally have the opportunity to locate the missing villager.
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 07.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...Just think of it as a way to divide and conquer.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Dain does have a point...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (But, something still feels off... What am I missing...?)
:{{Color|menu|Dainsleif's eyes follow you and Paimon as you depart, while your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}} slowly approaches him from a different direction...}}
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 08.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Hmph... I knew going along with your trap would be the only way to meet with you face to face.
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 heroine 01.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq302 9 hero 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler's Sibling}}:''' You risked your safety and that of the eye...
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 heroine 02.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq302 9 hero 02.ogg}} '''{{Traveler's Sibling}}:''' That's quite the gamble, Dainsleif... But I believe that I am the one walking into a trap laid by the Twilight Sword.
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 dainsleif 09.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' So you came here all on your own? What about those followers of yours?
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 heroine 03.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq302 9 hero 03.ogg}} '''{{Traveler's Sibling}}:''' When the Twilight Sword is prepared for battle, any army I could send would only be marching to their doom... Better that I face you alone.
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 heroine 04.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq302 9 hero 04.ogg}} '''{{Traveler's Sibling}}:''' I know you must have a lot to say...
:{{A|vo szaq302 9 heroine 05.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq302 9 hero 05.ogg}} '''{{Traveler's Sibling}}:''' ...But, if it's a conversation you want, you'll have to defeat me first.
