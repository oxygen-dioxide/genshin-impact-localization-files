#* Wave 3:
#** {{Enemy|Tenebrous Mimesis - Crackling Axe Mitachurl|x=3}}
# Meet up with [[Bona]]
# Talk to Bona

==Gameplay Notes==
* During Step 6, Wave 2 and 3, a {{Enemy|Secret Source Automaton: Hunter-Seeker}} assists in the battle. It counts as an ally, so it can't be harmed, nor can its attacks harm the player.
* The {{Item|Rust-Spotted Key}} can be found in map level [[Core of Chu'ulel]]: Interior, on a shelf in the bottom part of the northern room, beside [[Holy Sovereign's Notes#Holy Sovereign's Notes (IX)|Holy Sovereign's Notes (IX)]]. It is necessary to open a transparent barrier gate that leads back to the main room in order to retrieve the fifth and final [[Tutorial/Radiant Fragments|Radiant Fragment]].

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Following [[Cocouik]]'s guidance, you come to the palace ruins on [[Ochkanatlan]]'s upper levels. There seems to be something hidden beneath these ruins...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Bona, optional)
:'''Bona:''' We'll leave the area below to you. Thanks for doing this.
:'''Bona:''' Whatever you find down there, you have to come back and find me, alright?

;(Approach the marked location)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrooh...
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, the exterior's been corroded by the Abyss. Looks like it might fall off anytime. Is this what Coco was pointing at?
:'''Paimon:''' And we don't know what's inside, either, though Paimon's pretty sure it's not the Altar...
:{{DIcon}} "Rigid logic won't get us anywhere..."
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it now. Coco didn't want to come in because of the Abyss.
:{{DIcon}} We have to do something about the Abyss.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, and that must be why Coco didn't want to come in. We have to get rid of it!
:{{DIcon}} Let's go, {{Little One}}!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, what about Paimon? Rude!
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, let's get rid of all this filth first!

;(View [[#Tutorials|Tutorials]] for Chu'ulel Light Core, Radiant Pillars, Radiant Fragments, Malignant Abyssal Blight, and Abyssal Vortices, optional)

;(If attempting to extract Radiant Fragments while already carrying 2, optional)
::Already carrying max number of Radiant Fragments

;(If attempting to place Radiant Fragments while carrying none, optional)
::Not carrying enough Radiant Fragments

;(After activating the first Radiant Pillar)
:'''Paimon:''' These look just like Coco's energy fragments from before... Can we place them here to dispel the nearby filth?

;(After activating the main southern Radiant Pillar)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be enough to keep the Abyss in check here. Let's put it here for now.

;(After activating the Radiant Pillar and entering/dropping down the northern room)
:;(A [[Hilichurl Berserker]] attacks the Radiant Pillar and locks the player inside)

;(After dropping down inside the northern room and interacting with the mechanism)
::You can hear that the elevator is now back in service...

;(After activating the main western Radiant Pillar)
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, we're done cleaning up the filth here.

;(After the core drops down)
:'''Paimon:''' D&mdash;Did it drop down? Let's go take a look. Paimon sure hopes nothing's broken...

;(Approach the fallen core)
:'''Paimon:''' Agh, Abyssal creatures! Careful!

;(While fighting the enemies)
:;(During Wave 2, when a [[Secret Source Automaton: Hunter-Seeker]] assists in the battle)
::'''Paimon:''' Is this guy helping us... or protecting it?

:;(During Wave 3)
::'''Paimon:''' Seriously, more? How long is this fight gonna take?

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew... It's finally over.
:'''Paimon:''' The Secret Source Automaton protecting it has also calmed down.
:'''Paimon:''' Now let's see what's inside!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes it won't let her down... Huh, another [[Pyrophosphorite]] chunk? There's more than one?
:[[File:Vaulting the Wall of Morning Mist Pyrophosphorite.png|200px]]
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, the woven scrolls wrapped around it look familiar. They're just like the notes we found in the tower outside the ruins...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' That's pretty strange. Don't you think so too, {{Little One}}? {{Traveler}}, what's written on them?
::{{Readable|title=A Nameless Adventurer's Notes
|text=<!--
-->Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown. Weather: Rainy...<br><br><!--
-->...Unbelievable, I ended up being attacked by the dragon after all. But maybe I should be thanking it... After all, I wouldn't have stumbled upon this place without it...<br><br><!--
-->...The Core of Chu'ulel. Seems like it was once the heart of the entire city. I heard a member of the tribe speaking about it before, how in ancient times the [[Sacred Lord]] once transformed himself into the heart of the dragon city, but I never expected the meaning to be so literal...<br><br><!--
-->...Unlike those I've encountered elsewhere, the Secret Source Automatons here seem to be able to understand speech. Did the Sacred Lord make them in order to protect himself? Anyway, at least I don't have to worry about monsters coming after me for now...<br><br><!--
-->...I can't believe it actually worked. I used the Pyrophosphorite on my body to awaken the dragonspirit slumbering within the heart of the machine... But is this little guy really a dragonspirit? It's so small, and absolutely adorable! And it's green like a chunk of turquoise, so I think I'll call it Cocouik...<br><br><!--
-->...It's the path to the [[Altar of Primal Flame]]. I saw the signs left by Aunt [[Liriwu]], it really is the same path that ██ walked...<br><br><!--
-->...Still, there's only one chunk of Pyrophosphorite left. I must make sure I don't use it up before I get to the [[Tonatiuh]]...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, these notes really were left behind by the same adventurer. So this must be the Core of Chu'ulel, then?
:{{DIcon}} There are other possibilities.
::'''Paimon:''' True, and we did find a new hunk o' Pyrophosphorite here. Maybe there are more to be found elsewhere.
:{{DIcon}}  There are too many things here that make little sense.
::'''Paimon:''' True, and Coco did point us here. Did he know there was a Pyrophosphorite chunk and wanted us to have it? Paimon doesn't get it.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rroo...
:{{DIcon}} We should head back first.
::'''Paimon:''' You're right, Coco probably knows what's going on, and we did promise Bona that we'd go back no matter what we found.
:{{DIcon}} Let's take this back to Bona.
::'''Paimon:''' You're right, maybe Bona will know what's going on, and we did promise her that we'd go back no matter what we found.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's get out of here, and quick.
:;(Update {{Item|A Nameless Adventurer's Notes}})
:;(Obtain {{Item|Pyrophosphorite}})

;(Approach Bona)
:'''Bona:''' Hey! You're finally back!
:'''Bona:''' What did you find down there? Tell me all about it!
:'''Paimon:''' Actually...
:{{Black Screen|You tell Bona about everything that transpired below.}}
:'''Bona:''' Huh!? You found another piece of Pyrophosphorite? Wow, and here I thought that the one I have was the only one in the world.
:'''Bona:''' Wait, could mine be a counterfeit? ... Hmm, that might be why I haven't noticed anything special about it all these years.
:{{DIcon}} That can't be...
:'''Paimon:''' The one we found down there looks ordinary too, other than the patterns on it.
:{{DIcon}} We also discovered that...
:'''Paimon:''' Right, we found some strange notes left behind by an adventurer. Do you want to see 'em?
:'''Bona:''' Adventurer's notes? The ones who came to this cursed city are likely here for the Jade of Return anyway, so... Yeah, no need, I think.
:'''Paimon:''' But there were mentions of Pyrophosphorite and the Altar. Maybe...
:'''Bona:''' I know. That's exactly why I don't want to look at the notes before I find the Jade.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Why?
:'''Bona:''' Over the years, many adventurers have set off to find the Tonatiuh and the Jade...
:'''Bona:''' But they all failed, and no one has been able to prove the existence of the vessel in the sky.
:'''Bona:''' Most think it's just a dream, an illusion. A fantasy that people suffering due to the Abyss find solace in.
:'''Bona:''' So their adventures were never recorded by storytellers, and their deeds were never lauded.
:'''Bona:''' If we cannot find the Tonatiuh and retrieve the Jade of Return, then everything they did would have been in vain.
:{{DIcon}} The journey itself is significant.
::'''Bona:''' You really think so? It's rare to find adventurers who emphasize the journey in Natlan.
::'''Bona:''' Adventurers with no accomplishments do exist, but most adventurers need something to prove themselves, no?
:{{DIcon}} The experience is important.
::'''Bona:''' Your point assumes that the ship actually exists. What if it's just a story?
:'''Bona:''' That's why we must succeed. For my old man, and for the adventurers who lost their lives while trying.
:'''Bona:''' As for the notes you found... Regardless of its origin, they won't have any significance until we board the Tonatiuh.
:'''Bona:''' So, if we do find the vessel and return safely, make sure you two tell everyone at the [[Adventurers' Guild]] about what we've done, alright?
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, Paimon has a knack for such things.
::'''Paimon:''' What, are you trying to say that Paimon is good at exaggerating? Anyway, if we really do find the legendary ship, telling [[Katheryne]] will be as good as telling all of [[Teyvat]]!
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, we are legendary adventurers, after all. Just give any journalist our story and we'll be all over the headlines!
:{{DIcon}} {{Little One}} will take care of it.
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's happy it agreed, but even if it wanted to say something, it can only talk to other [[Saurian]] adventurers, right? ...Wait, are Saurian adventurers even a thing?
:'''Bona:''' Anyway... You haven't shown me the Pyrophosphorite that you found yet!
:'''Paimon:''' Right! {{Traveler}}, show them the Pyrophosphorite! Maybe Coco will remember something when it sees the stone.
:'''Cocouik:''' Kulu...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rooo... Rawr...
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What's going on? The light! It stings!
:'''Cocouik:''' Chee! Kucheep!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh! Coco suddenly looks... invigorated!
:{{DIcon}} Looks like firing the "Super Awesomesauce Laser" shouldn't be a problem.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh... How did you remember such a frivolous name?
::'''Paimon:''' But still, could this be the same phenomenon as the energy scraps we found before? As in, that energy can be stored in Pyrophosphorite?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like Pyrophosphorites contain the energy as well.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, it's the same as what happened with those energy scraps from before...
:'''Paimon:''' And Coco, in turn, uses the energy stored within to fight the Abyss.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Bona:''' {{Traveler}}, look!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, what's happening!? The mural looks different now!
:'''Bona:''' So this was covered up by the mural that we saw before...
:{{DIcon}} We've seen this in another, previous mural...
::'''Paimon:''' Isn't that the big black dragon on the mural in the ruins where we got the first Golden Entreaty?
::'''Paimon:''' But in this painting, it looks like the black dragon is the master of this place.
:{{DIcon}} The dragon entrenches itself above the city...
::'''Paimon:''' This painting sure does make it look like the evil dragon is the master of this place.
:'''Cocouik:''' Cheep... Ku!
:'''Paimon:''' Coco? What is it? Do you know anything about this mural?
:'''Cocouik:''' Yee!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. The light's pointing toward the sky this time...
:'''Cocouik:''' Ku-ku!
:'''Bona:''' Right, this is it. The Altar of Primal Flame must be in that direction, at the highest point of the ancient city!
:'''Paimon:''' Are you sure? Paimon gets worried whenever you sound so confident about something...
:'''Bona:''' Just trust me once more, would ya? I have a good feeling about this!
:'''Paimon:''' Is that what we're relying on nowadays? Well, not that we have anything else to trust in, so... let's get up there.
