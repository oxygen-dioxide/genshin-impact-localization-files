:'''Lixin:''' Everyone is welcome to work with the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]]! We are currently expanding, with new business ventures across a variety of industries!
:{{DIcon}} About commercial cooperation...
::'''Lixin:''' Oh? Are you a merchant too?
::'''Lixin:''' The Feiyun Commerce Guild is currently exploring new business opportunities, including combining fabrics and jade, adding tea during the fabric-dyeing process to introduce new fragrances, and more!
::'''Lixin:''' If you're interested in a business partnership, just talk to me and I'll faithfully inform the commerce guild of the specifics of your intentions!
:{{DIcon}} Will the heir to your family come?
::'''Lixin:''' About that... I am not entirely sure! I've been working here at Feiyun Commerce Guild for some time now, yet I still haven't laid eyes on Master [[Xingqiu]]!
::'''Lixin:''' I heard that the old grounds of the [[Guhua Clan]] are somewhere in Chenyu Vale. Perhaps someday Master Xingqiu will come and visit, should the mood strike him!
::'''Lixin:''' I've heard that Master Xingqiu is experienced beyond his years and his knowledge is vast. Perhaps after coming to Chenyu Vale, he'll have a stroke of genius or three and give us some great new ideas!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe next time...
::'''Lixin:''' Very well! I eagerly await the opportunity to formally begin our commercial collaboration!
