|text    = Today is my birthday, but as you may know, entertaining guests always involves a lot of effort. So I thought, maybe this time, I'd keep it simple and invite only one or two of my best friends.

I made some [[Qiankun Mora Meat]] for you to try. Let me know what you think. I know you're a great cook, so I would appreciate your insight.

Moreover, I've heard today that wild [[Glaze Lily|Glaze Lilies]] are blooming outside the [[Liyue Harbor|city]]. I made a trip down and was lucky enough to pick one.

Just like the rumors said, this wild flower is of high quality and very fragrant, rarer than the artificially planted flowers from [[Yujing Terrace]].

Selling it to someone who knows their flowers might fetch a good price. However, [[Mora]] is precious, but good friends are much more valuable. This flower that I personally picked is for you. I hope you will enjoy its beauty and fragrance.
