{{Quest Description|Raef from Aaru Village seems to be troubled by something...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Raef)
:'''Raef:''' Agh, there's just no time at all...
:'''Raef:''' And no one will swap shifts with me, either. What do I do now...
:'''Raef:''' Eh? Traveler? Um... Traveler, please hold on a moment!
:{{DIcon}} What's going on?
:'''Raef:''' I'm sorry for taking up your time, but I'd like to ask you if you're free... and if you could do me a favor...
:{{DIcon}} Well, let's hear your story, then...
::'''Raef:''' You'd help me! Thank you! Thank you so much!
:{{DIcon}} If you've got the pay, I've got the time.
::'''Raef:''' Eh? Well... I do have some savings, so you don't have to worry about that...
::'''Raef:''' But either way, thank you so much for agreeing to help.
:'''Raef:''' Here's the situation: I ordered a flower pot from Azalai's shop, alongside a batch of seeds.
:'''Raef:''' Originally, I had asked a friend to help me get them...
:'''Raef:''' But he suddenly told me that he had a mission to attend to and wouldn't have time to help me out. There was too little time for me to find someone else...
:'''Raef:''' So Traveler, could you please help me collect my purchases from Azalai's? I hear that he should be at the entrance to the village right now, waiting for goods to come in.
:{{DIcon}} What did you buy all this stuff for, anyway?
:'''Raef:''' They're for my girlfriend, Nermin.
:'''Raef:''' She's in poor health, so she's been convalescing at home.
:'''Raef:''' I mean, you've seen it too. Aaru Village is in the middle of the desert, so there's not much greenery to go around. Can't say this is the best environment, can you?
:'''Raef:''' So I bought some plants to place in her house, but always staying in her room has kept her in a bad mood.
:'''Raef:''' I'm also very busy at work, so I basically can't go to see her in the day. We only have time to talk to each other at night...
:'''Raef:''' That's why I thought that perhaps I could get her to raise some flowers herself, if only just to help pass the time and take her mind off her illness.
:'''Raef:''' I didn't expect things to get complicated like this...
:{{DIcon}} I'll go on your behalf.
:{{DIcon}} I'll get you your things.
:'''Raef:''' Thank you so much! Just bring them straight back to me once you get them.
:'''Raef:''' I need to sow those seeds, loosen the soil, apply some fertilizer...
:'''Raef:''' But Nermin's constitution isn't that great. Will all this work just tire her out...?

;(Talk to Raef again)
:'''Raef:''' I do hope that Nermin can get better soon...

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Raef, optional)
:'''Raef:''' (I hope Nermin will cheer up.)
----
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Azalai, optional)
:'''Azalai:''' (Just think about all the trouble I have to go through for every batch of goods... *sigh*)

;(Talk to Azalai)
:'''Azalai:''' Huh, so there was another batch after all...
:{{DIcon}} Hey, about Raef's goods...
:'''Azalai:''' Oh, you mean the stuff he ordered from me? Well, you're in luck! The batch of goods I just received has his stuff in there.
:'''Azalai:''' I must say, though, that he ordered quite a lot of things. Are you here to pick up his order?
:{{DIcon}} Are they very heavy?
:{{DIcon}} How much did he order...?
:'''Azalai:''' Well, apart from that pot, he's also ordered various seeds, fertilizer, and other items used in gardening...
:'''Azalai:''' They're pretty weighty when put together. Are you sure you'll be fine by yourself?
:{{DIcon}} I've got my ways.
:{{DIcon}} I did agree to help, so...
:'''Azalai:''' Ah, is that so... Well, that's fine. I'll just get all this stuff wrapped up for you. Thanks for making the trip, by the way...
:;(Obtain {{Item|Raef's Package}})

;(Talk to Azalai again)
:'''Azalai:''' Strange, where's that other batch of goods?
----
;(Talk to Raef)
:'''Raef:''' Traveler! Have you brought the stuff?
:;(Submit {{Item|Raef's Package}})
:'''Raef:''' These are the ones. Thank you so much, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} Sure you're not trying to open your own flower shop?
:{{DIcon}} What do you need so much stuff for!?
:'''Raef:''' Uh, well, I... I just wanted to buy more at once to save myself some extra trips, you know?
:'''Raef:''' Anyway, go rest over there for a while. I need to sow these seeds and put some fertilizer in and...
:{{Black Screen|Raef starts working on the flower pot...}}
:'''Raef:''' Alright, this should do it! All Nermin needs to do is water this plant.
:'''Raef:''' Traveler, could I, ah, trouble you to help me bring this flower pot to her?
:{{DIcon}} Why don't you go yourself?
:'''Raef:''' I need to guard this path. If any foodstuffs or goods pass through, I'll need to get more people from the village to come take them.
:'''Raef:''' And you know how it is around here. If we're too slow, the goods are going to spoil under the sun.
:'''Raef:''' Just do me this favor, please. Nermin's not far from here. All you have to do is give this pot of flowers to her. I'll find a way to bring the rest to her.

;(Talk to Raef again)
:'''Raef:''' I... Did I buy too many things...?
----
;(Place the items at the marked location)
:{{Black Screen|Someone inside hears movement...}}
:'''Nermin:''' Hello. May I help you with anything?
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'm here to give you this flower pot.
:'''Nermin:''' Huh... Is this from Raef?
:'''Nermin:''' There are flowers in this pot? Really? Thank you for helping him send this to me. I like it very much...
:'''Nermin:''' But... Can I really raise these flowers properly?
:{{DIcon}} Is it your first time growing flowers?
:'''Nermin:''' Well, no. I'm just... not very good at taking care of plants. The previous ones all withered in my hands...
:'''Nermin:''' I imagine that this pot of flowers must be even more delicate still. If I were to fail to care for it properly again...
:'''Nermin:''' Ugh, no, no, I can't just... Since the flowers are already in my hands, I must take good care of it!
:'''Nermin:''' Perhaps Granny [[Kulsoom]] knows how to solve this problem...

;(Talk to Nermin again)
:'''Nermin:''' If these flowers needs to be watered every day, just how much water will I need by the end?

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Nermin, optional)
:'''Nermin:''' (Can I really raise these flowers properly?)
----
;(Talk to Raef)
:'''Raef:''' You're back, Traveler. Thank you so much for helping out... How is Nermin doing?
:{{DIcon}} She's worried that she won't be able to take care of the flowers.
::'''Raef:''' Well... I'll help her look into this. If all else fails, we'll find someone to ask about it.
::'''Raef:''' And if even that fails... I'll just... look for something that's easy to grow and keep alive, I guess.
:{{DIcon}} Have you never sent her flowers before?
::'''Raef:''' Well, I wouldn't say that exactly, but the ones I would ask people to help me buy for her were already fully-grown. By the time they arrived in the village, they were nearly all dried out...
::'''Raef:''' That's why I decided that I would send her a freshly planted pot of flowers this time.
:'''Raef:''' Well, in any case, thanks for helping me out, Traveler. Please, take this as your reward.
:'''Raef:''' I'll send the other items to her later.
:'''Raef:''' Wait a moment. Did these gardening tools not come with instruction manuals? ...Oh no. I have no idea how to use them!
