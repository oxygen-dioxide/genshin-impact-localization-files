{{Description|Certified player Pitot, helmsman of The Rusty Rudder &mdash; that is to say, the boss of the tavern. As the boss, he is directly involved in interacting with guests and helping them pick their drinks, and he's more than down for playing all sorts of games, including Genius Invokation TCG. He has sharpened his card skills a great deal. A tavern boss who loses to guests might be called upon to pour some out on the house, after all.|[[Map]] description}}
