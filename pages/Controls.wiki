'''Controls''' in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' differs depending on the device. Mobile devices are primarily touch based controls (with one instance of Gyro input), PlayStation has controller inputs, and PC has mouse and keyboard inputs, or controller inputs.

==PC and Controllers==
[[File:Diagram Control Xbox.png|thumb|Xbox diagram]]
[[File:Diagram Control PS4.png|thumb|PS4 diagram]]
Since PC is a flexible device, it can take both the standard Keyboard Inputs, as well as Controller Inputs. Touch is not supported on PC. Plugging in any brand of controller (Xbox and PlayStation) will result in a map of the respective controller, with critical actions mapped to each button. However, connecting a Switch controller to the PC doesn't seem to be fully supported, even though the game detects it as a controller.

Disconnecting your controller without swapping back to Keyboard Inputs will cause the game to be soft locked, requiring a "force quit" ({{keys|Alt|F4}}) to close the game and restart.

Any {{w|DirectInput}} (or [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xinput/getting-started-with-xinput XInput]) supported {{w|HID}} game controller (USB or Bluetooth) will be recognized by the game as a valid controller, as the game runs on {{w|DirectX}}.

As with all types of controls, you can tweak the camera sensitivity for normal gameplay as well as Aimed Shot Mode. However, the game does not have the invert Y-axis option on mouse and keyboard. Inverting the Y-axis as well as the X-axis is possible only on a controller.

PlayStation consoles share the same controls as when using a PlayStation controller with PC.

==Mobile==
Mobile devices lack buttons to be mapped to certain functionality; all actions are done by tapping the screen. However, there is an extra feature called "Gyro Aiming". With Gyro Aiming enabled, you can use the gyroscope in your mobile device for '''Aimed Shot'''.

The following controls can be changed under Settings.
