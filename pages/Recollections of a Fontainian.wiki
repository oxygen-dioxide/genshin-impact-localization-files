{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on [[Augustus Lovelace]], optional)
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' (Ugh, has Xavier fallen under the spell of Inazuma? I'm certain the [[Yashiro Commission]] knows nothing about films anyway...)
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' (Couldn't he just slap together something for them and get out of there...?)

;(Talk to Augustus Lovelace)
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' A-Achoo! The smell of these spices is just too... A-ACHOO!
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I should just take a picture and go hide in my room...
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Traveler! Hey! Traveler! Hold on a second!
:{{DIcon}} Who, me?
:{{DIcon}} What can I do for you?
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I'd like your help with taking a picture, just one. It won't take long.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' *sigh* It's embarrassing to admit, but the aroma of the spices here is a little too strong for me...
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' During my time in [[Fontaine]], I never had food with even just a hint of spiciness, a pinch of salt is as much as I can take.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Here, I'm sneezing so much that&mdash; ACHOO! I can't even hold the [[Kamera]] steadily...
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' So, all I can do... is ask someone else to take a photo for me.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' You certainly seem to be a kind person, so... I'd like to ask for your help.
:{{DIcon}} You're from Fontaine?
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Indeed. I'm very sorry that I forgot to introduce myself...
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I'm Augustus Lovelace, a researcher from [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering]].
:{{DIcon}} Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering?
:{{DIcon}} What kind of place is that?
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' It's a mouthful, isn't it? You can call it the Fontaine Research Institute, as most people in Fontaine do.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' The Fontaine Research Institute used to be a paradise for researchers in Fontaine and where most mechanical creations originated.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' But thanks to [[Edwin Eastinghouse|Mr. Edwin]], most buildings in the Fontaine Research Institute are lying in ruin now...
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' And ever since [[Raimondo]] and [[Choiseul|Mr. Choiseul]] took over the reconstruction project, the spirit of research at the institute has been in freefall.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I have standards and prefer a tidy environment. I refuse to live in a pile of rubble, and so I've been traveling around.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Don't let my troubles spoil your mood, they have nothing to do with you.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Come on, please hurry and snap a photo for me. Once [[Xavier]] sees the beauty of Sumeru, there's no way he'll stay in Inazuma!
;(If the player has completed [[Film Notes]])
:{{DIcon}} I've worked with Xavier...
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' You... Whoa! Are you the Traveler that Xavier told me about?
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' A pleasure! It's truly an honor to meet you! I've read all about your heroic feats in the [[Mikage Furnace]] from Xavier's letters.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' And whenever Xavier talks about films in his letters, he always mentions your extraordinary acting skills!
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' He says you're fearless, noble, and most importantly, you have a great sense of humor!
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Oh, once you've taken the photo, you must give me your autograph. It would be perfect if you signed the photo!
::{{DIcon}} How is Xavier doing these days?
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Well, to be honest... not great. He's anxious about his film, and based on his letters, he has been having trouble finding an interesting new subject lately.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I suggested that he should do as I did and take some time off in Sumeru.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' But he keeps insisting that he must shoot the best possible film for the Yashiro Commission, and he refuses to leave Inazuma until it's done.
:{{DIcon}} How did you get to know Xavier?
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' As you must be well aware, Xavier is a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute. We used to work in the same laboratory, and he once gave me quite a bit of help.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' He insisted on shooting a film and being the director. That wasn't a very popular idea in Fontaine Research Institute at the time.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Even after being assigned to other projects, he still continued shooting "dokumentari films" in the name of recording their research process.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Just like that, he went back and forth between projects and the laboratory until he was finally sent to Inazuma...
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' He's a very resourceful person. I'm certain that had he been born in the past, when funding was abundant and more fields of research were accepted, or been born in a brighter future, he would have accomplished great things...
;(If the player has not completed [[Film Notes]])
:{{DIcon}} About Xavier...
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Xavier is a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute. We used to work in the same laboratory, and he once gave me quite a bit of help.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' He insisted on shooting a film and being the director. That wasn't a very popular idea in Fontaine Research Institute at the time.

:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' That's enough of that. Come and take a photo of me. Right here will do.

;(Talk to Augustus again)
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Have you taken my picture?
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Oh, take your time. Taking a good photo is no easy task.

;(Take a photo facing the sailing ship and Augustus)<!--Please adjust the camera angle to face the sailing ship and Augustus-->
:'''Paimon:''' That should do it, let's show him the photo!

;(Talk to Augustus)
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Not bad indeed. You have a gift.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' It's the first time in my travels that I've met someone with such control over composition and color.
:{{DIcon}} Where have your travels taken you?
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Ah, that, well... I could have come directly to Sumeru from Fontaine... after all, there's a line going straight to the [[Bayda Harbor]] in Sumeru.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' But as they say, it's about the journey, not the destination. So I chose a... more interesting route.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' First, I went from [[Lumidouce Harbor]] to [[Chenyu Vale]], and then passed through [[Qingce Village]] on my way to the [[Stone Gate]] that separates [[Mondstadt]] from [[Liyue]].
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' After stopping by [[Dawn Winery]], I decided to head south and visit [[Liyue Harbor]].
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I embarked on a ferry to [[Port Ormos]] from Liyue Harbor, traveled northward along the river, and here I am standing before you.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' After all, my goal is to relax. Were I a brave warrior with a passion for adventure...
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' ...I might have decided to set out from [[Romaritime Harbor]] and followed the ancient path of the [[Oceanid|pilgrims]], heading southward into the [[Girdle of the Sands|desert]].
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Who knows? Maybe I'll try to cross the desert on the way back. Anyway, I've still got extra Mora to spend, and paying a visit to [[Natlan]] on the other side of the desert sounds nice too...
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Alright, I won't keep you any longer. Thank you for helping me with the photo, please accept this as a token of my gratitude.
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I'm off to write to Xavier. If he still won't come to Sumeru, then I might as well go back to Fontaine...
