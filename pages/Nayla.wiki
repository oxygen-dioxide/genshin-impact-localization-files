==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nayla:''' [[King Deshret]]... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} Still a believer?
::'''Nayla:''' Yes, I still am. I'm an Eremite born and raised, and I grew up listening to legends of King Deshret. My beliefs will not be easily swayed.
::'''Nayla:''' But I no longer believe in his revival.
::'''Nayla:''' Huh, from the looks of it, I'd wager you're the new friend the boss talked about.
::'''Nayla:''' The Eremites always welcome new hands, but I'll remind you that even friends are not forever.
::'''Nayla:''' I, at least, will make you no guarantees that we'll always be on the same side.
:{{DIcon}} The revival of King Deshret is a lie.
::'''Nayla:''' ...Yes, I know that.
