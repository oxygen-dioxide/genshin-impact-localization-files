'''Faith Eternal''' is a [[:Category:Special Dishes|special]] [[food]] item that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Egg Roll]] with [[Kujou Sara]]. The [[recipe]] for Egg Roll is available from [[Shimura Kanbei]] in [[Inazuma City]] for 1,250 [[Mora]].

Faith Eternal revives a character and restores '''10'''% of Max HP, then restores an additional '''150''' HP to the target fallen character with a 120-second cooldown. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].
