{{Lang|'''Yip Gaming'''{{Name Order|Chinese}}|yue=叶嘉明|yue_rm=Yip<sup>6</sup> Ga<sup>1</sup> Ming<sup>4</sup>}} is a playable {{Pyro}} [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Born in [[Qiaoying Village]], Gaming left his birthplace after an impasse with [[Yip Tak|his father]] to pursue his passion and become a professional Wushou dancer, training constantly to make the dance popular throughout [[Teyvat]]. However, with his dream career turning out to be financially unsustainable by itself, he also took up a job as a guard for the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency, primarily escorting goods and people to and from [[Yilong Wharf]]. His diligence and friendliness have earned him renown, and he is considered to be the best guard in the agency.
