{{Quest Description|According to Arakavi, Arayasa, Aradasa, and Arasudraka are looking for clues about Ashvattha's Concourses in the wild. Arama will meet up with them later. Join them in the search of the concourses, for it is the key to finding Vasoma Fruits.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? [[Arama]]'s over there... Is he looking for an Ashvattha's concourse?
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|You meet Arama and some Aranara that you've never seen before...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Arayasa &mdash; if this is the first quest started out of the three)
::'''Paimon:''' We meet again, Arama!
::'''Arama:''' Ooh! Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Hello!
::'''Arama:''' Right, this is [[Arayasa]]. We met here when we were looking for [[Ashvattha's Concourses]].
::'''Paimon:''' Hello, Arayasa!
::{{DIcon}} Hello!
::'''Arayasa:''' "The next song is a poem about a young {{MC|m=woman|f=man}} in search of the thing most dear to {{MC|m=her|f=him}}. At the journey's beginning, {{MC|m=her|f=his}} eyes were amber, without a hint of gloom..."
::'''Paimon:''' ...?
::{{DIcon}} That's a little odd...
::{{DIcon}} Is he a bard?
::'''Arama:''' Yes. Arayasa is one of the "song gatherers" who collect songs of all kinds. He is the boldest of them all, and often learns Nara songs.
::'''Arayasa:''' "Our destinies were like pearls born in the same hour..."
::{{DIcon}} We're not getting through at all...
::{{DIcon}} "Ahh, our sinfully sweet destinies."
:::'''Paimon:''' Eek!! Stop, {{Traveler}}! Stop!
:::'''Arama:''' Nara {{Traveler}} is awesome! Your song is just like Arayasa's! I didn't understand a word of what either of you sang!
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, let's get back to the point, shall we? So, is this one of [[Ashvattha's Concourse]]s?
::'''Arama:''' No, it is not. But it is a great discovery nonetheless. Here lies a song that we Aranara have been unable to find for many, many years.
::'''Arama:''' Aranara song gatherers always pursue the beauty of songs. At the end of time, they will leave behind a song that belongs only to themselves.
::{{DIcon}} Does this have anything to do with Ashvattha's Concourses?
:::'''Arama:''' Yes! This seems to be the song left by [[Araji]]. If that's the case, there should be a [[Vasara Tree]] nearby.
::{{DIcon}} Best of luck to you, then.
:::'''Arama:''' Thank you, Nara {{Traveler}}! This seems to be the song left by Araji. If that's the case, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby. We have the best luck!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers Araja saying something about the Vasara Trees... Let Paimon check the Aranyaka real quick...
::'''Paimon:''' Vasara Trees bear [[Vasoma Fruit]]s! We should help them, {{Traveler}}!
::'''Arayasa:''' "Aah, this yearning will bear fruit as scarlet as pomegranates. Even if fate clouds your eyes..."
::{{DIcon}} Since we need it to help Rana...
::{{DIcon}} "The song from your lips cannot be taken away..."
:::'''Paimon:''' Ughhh! {{Traveler}}, what are you doing!? You're acting all weird!
:::'''Arama:''' I think Nara {{Traveler}} should get along very well with Arayasa!
:::'''Paimon:''' Don't encourage {{MC|m=him|f=her}}!
::'''Arama:''' Well, anyway, the song is hidden among the roses. Arayasa and I have looked for a long, long time, but we couldn't find anything. The roses wouldn't talk to us either.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon sees. {{Traveler}}, let's try having a look, too!
::{{DIcon}} I'll give it a go.
:::'''Paimon:''' Yup! And anyway, finding stuff is what we do best!
::{{DIcon}} "I will illuminate your song."
:::'''Paimon:''' ...

;(Talk to Arayasa &mdash; if this is '''not''' the first quest started out of the three)
::'''Paimon:''' We meet again, Arama!
::'''Arama:''' Ooh! Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Hello!
::'''Arama:''' Right, this is Arayasa. He is also a song gatherer.
::'''Paimon:''' Hello, Arayasa!
::{{DIcon}} Hello!
::'''Arayasa:''' "The next song is a poem about a young {{MC|m=woman|f=man}} in search of the thing most dear to {{MC|m=her|f=him}}. At the journey's beginning, {{MC|m=her|f=his}} eyes were amber, without a hint of gloom..."
::'''Paimon:''' ...?
::{{DIcon}} That's a little odd...
::{{DIcon}} Is he a bard?
::'''Arama:''' Arayasa is the boldest among the Aranara song gatherers and often learns Nara songs. That's why he talks in a special way.
::'''Arayasa:''' "Our destinies were like pearls born in the same hour..."
::{{DIcon}} We're not getting through at all...
::{{DIcon}} "Ahh, our sinfully sweet destinies."
:::'''Paimon:''' Eek!! Stop, {{Traveler}}! Stop!
:::'''Arama:''' Nara {{Traveler}} is awesome! I didn't understand a word of what you sang!
::'''Paimon:''' Let's get back to the point... Since Arayasa is a song gatherer, does that mean there is a Concourse of Ashvattha around here?
::'''Arama:''' Araji left his last song here. In that case, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, let's help out too, {{Traveler}}! We've gotta hurry and get that Vasoma Fruit!
::'''Arayasa:''' "Aah, this yearning will bear fruit as scarlet as pomegranates. Even if fate clouds your eyes..."
::{{DIcon}} For Rana...
::{{DIcon}} "The song from your lips cannot be taken away..."
:::'''Paimon:''' Uhhh&mdash; {{Traveler}}, what are you doing!? You're acting all weird!
:::'''Arama:''' I think Nara {{Traveler}} should get along very well with Arayasa!
:::'''Paimon:''' Don't encourage {{MC|m=him|f=her}}!
::'''Arama:''' As before, the song is hidden among the roses. But since it's Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon, I'm sure you'll find it!
::{{DIcon}} Leave this to me.
:::'''Paimon:''' Yep! Paimon will!
::{{DIcon}} "I will illuminate your song."
:::'''Paimon:''' ...

;(Talk to Arama again)
:'''Arama:''' Hm... The song should be hidden amongst those roses...

;(Talk to Arayasa again)
:'''Arayasa:''' "On the other side of the distant horizon..."

{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|It seems that the Aranara of the past left behind some songs within the Sumeru Roses. These songs contain clues to the location of Ashvattha's Concourses. Whether this is true or not, it is best to observe these roses from different perspectives.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Observe the stone)
:These {{Color|buzzword|patterns}} may have some connection with the "hidden song" in the roses...

;(After finding the correct orientation)
:'''Paimon:''' It lit up! {{Traveler}}, {{color|buzzword|play your instrument}} according to the pattern on the roses! C'mon, give it a go!

;(After playing the song)
:'''Arama:''' Ooh... This is Araji's song...
:'''Arayasa:''' Ahh... I was able to hear your song again. Our promise can finally be fulfilled. Araji, I will carry your song with me and keep on singing.
:'''Arayasa:''' Thank you, good Nara. Arayasa will not forget.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Somehow Arayasa's kinda speaking normally!
:'''Arama:''' Thank you, Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Arayasa and Araji are good friends, so he's been looking for this song all this time.
:'''Arayasa:''' Araji is a... timid friend who liked to hide in quiet places and sing softly. His songs can open unknown paths. Now that you understand this song...
:'''Arayasa:''' You'll be able to open the path to Ashvattha's Concourse located here.
:'''Arama:''' Yep! You can leave the rest to us!
:'''Arayasa:''' Okay, let's meet at Festival Utsava, {{MC|m=handsome|f=beautiful}} Nara.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|The song hidden within the rose can unlock an unknown path. Follow the mysterious traces with Arama and reach Ashvattha's Concourse using the Rhythm of the Gloomy Path.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Arama:''' Singing Araji's song at the correct place should open the path towards Ashvattha's Concourse.
:'''Paimon:''' That's a pretty sweet trick! Araji's pretty awesome, huh?

{{Quest Description|update|You have cleaned up The Withering that was affecting the concourse. Next, try investigating the tree inside it.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
<!-- The investigate the tree dialogue may seem the same across the three quests but there are some significant differences, so no transcluding... -->
;(Investigate the tree &mdash; if this is the first quest started out of the three)
::'''Paimon:''' Is this... the Vasara Tree? Doesn't seem as lively as Paimon imagined...
::'''Arama:''' Yes, the corrosion from Marana is getting worse. It's not only the land. Marana exists in the Sarva, too.
::'''Arama:''' Marana will speak of the horrors of death to the trees and flowers it corrodes. Life that did not know of death will then begin to wither.
::'''Arama:''' We have been fighting against Marana. Araji was also fighting hard against it.
::'''Paimon:''' Araji? Isn't that someone you mentioned? An Aranara who lived in the past?
::'''Arama:''' Yes. Thank you, Araji. We've never met before, but your song sounds great. Please, leave the rest to me, Nara {{Traveler}}, and Paimon.
::{{DIcon}} How can we get the Vasoma Fruit?
::'''Arama:''' First, we must enter his dream to destroy Marana's lingering influence.
::'''Paimon:''' Wait a second... When you say "his dream," you mean that of the Vasara Tree?
::'''Arama:''' Yes. If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...
::{{DIcon}} (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)
:::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)
::;(Enter the dream)
:::{{Black Screen|You seem to have entered someone else's dream...}}
::{{DIcon}} I need a minute.
:::'''{{Traveler}}:''' I need a minute.
:::'''Arama:''' No problem. I'll wait for you.

;(Investigate the tree &mdash; if this is the second quest started out of the three)
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't expect Marana's corruption to be here too...
::'''Arama:''' Nara {{Traveler}} is amazing. You drove Marana away easily this time, too.
::'''Arama:''' The corrosion from Marana is getting worse. It's not just infecting the land. It is here, and even in [[Sarva]].
::'''Arama:''' Marana will speak of the horrors of death to the trees and flowers it corrodes. Life that did not know of death will then begin to wither.
::'''Arama:''' We have been fighting against Marana. Araji was also fighting hard against it.
::'''Paimon:''' Araji? Isn't that someone you mentioned? An Aranara who lived in the past?
::'''Arama:''' Yes. Thank you, Araji. We've never met before, but your song sounds great. Please, leave the rest to me, Nara {{Traveler}}, and Paimon.
::{{DIcon}} Do we need to enter the dream of the Vasara Tree this time too?
::'''Arama:''' Yes. We must erase all traces of Marana's influence.
::'''Arama:''' That's right. If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...
::{{DIcon}} (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)
:::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)
::;(Enter the dream)
:::{{Black Screen|You seem to have entered someone else's dream...}}
::{{DIcon}} I need a minute.
:::'''{{Traveler}}:''' I need a minute.
:::'''Arama:''' No problem. I'll wait for you.

;(Investigate the tree &mdash; if this is the third quest started out of the three)
::'''Paimon:''' Next up, our third Vasoma Fruit!
::{{DIcon}} Let's do this for the Bija...
::{{DIcon}} Let's do this for Rana...
::'''Arama:''' The corrosion from Marana is getting worse. It's not just infecting the land. It is here, and even in Sarva.
::'''Arama:''' Marana will speak of the horrors of death to the trees and flowers it corrodes. Life that did not know of death will then begin to wither.
::'''Arama:''' We have been fighting against Marana. Araji was also fighting hard against it.
::'''Paimon:''' Araji? Isn't that someone you mentioned? An Aranara who lived in the past?
::'''Arama:''' Yes. Thank you, Araji. We've never met before, but your song sounds great. Please, leave the rest to me, Nara {{Traveler}}, and Paimon.
::{{DIcon}} Let's go.
::'''Arama:''' If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...
::{{DIcon}} (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)
:::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)
::;(Enter the dream)
:::{{Black Screen|You seem to have entered someone else's dream...}}

{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|You have entered the dream of the Vasara Tree. As long as you solve the problem here, you should be able to obtain a Vasoma Fruit.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the central platform)
:'''Arama:''' Marana's influence is not strong here. Great news for us.
:'''Paimon:''' But this dream sure is jammed with Fungi... Why Would the Vasara Tree dream of so many Fungi?
:'''Paimon:''' Is it because the Vasara Trees likes mushrooms? Just like how Paimon often dreams about the Sweet Madames {{Traveler}} makes...
:'''Arama:''' Oh! So Paimon likes Sweet Madames. Are they also Paimon's good friends?
:'''Paimon:''' That's not exactly it...

;(Approach the first [[Gloomy Path]])
:'''Arama:''' Yes! We can use Araji's song here to proceed further.

;(Upon exiting the Gloomy Path)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... This method of traveling across spaces is making Paimon feel dizzy...
:'''Arama:''' Really? Maybe it's because Paimon's head is too big. Small Paimon, huge head.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, you don't get it at all! You see, the head is where wisdom is stored. So, Paimon must be super wise!
:'''Arama:''' Oh, I see! Sumpter Beasts have bigger heads, so they must be smarter than Paimon, right?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Hey!

;(Collect the second rosin)
:'''Arama:''' Oh!
:'''Paimon:''' What!? Arama, is everything okay? Why did you...
:'''Arama:''' Specters are float heads, which means they must be really clever, right? Paimon is no match for them!
:'''Paimon:''' He does have a point... Wait, no! Paimon's gotta think of something to say in rebuttal...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh right! You need to look at a Fungus for that. Fungi have a body and head, so you'll have something there for comparison. Proportion is key here!
:'''Arama:''' Oh, I get it now. Paimon is just as smart as a Fungus. Small Fungus, huge head.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Hey!

;(Approach the locked common chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, what's that?

;(Defeat the fungi and approach the now-unlocked chest)
:'''Paimon:''' So, Arama, do you know why there's so many Fungi in this dream?
:'''Arama:''' Because Fungi dream too. In the stories, many many moons ago, spores and mushrooms could not float or walk.
:'''Arama:''' But Nara came and helped spores. Then spores became stronger and turned into Fungi
:'''Arama:''' Fungi produce more spores. And with more spores, more Fungi appear.
:'''Arama:''' Fungi can dream too. When Marana came, many Fungi went hiding in their dreams, shunning Marana.
:'''Paimon:''' Now Paimon gets it. We've seen lots of them in the Withering, so Paimon thought that the Fungi somehow liked it there...

;(Approach the second Gloomy Path)
:'''Paimon:''' It's the same here. We can use Araji's song to proceed further.

;(Collect the third rosin)
:'''Paimon:''' That should be the last one. But wow, we're really high up, aren't we? And looks like there's still further to go...
:'''Arama:''' Of course! Dreams are vast places!
:'''Arama:''' Araji was timid and scared of the real world. So he often dreamed of singing inside a really big place.
:'''Arama:''' Okay! Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon, let's go!

;(Approach the door)
:'''Arama:''' Alright, Marana's influence should be right inside. If left unattended, it will soon turn the dream into a horrifying nightmare.
:'''Arama:''' If we take care of the baddies inside, the Vasara Tree will become healthy again and thank us with a Vasoma Fruit.

;(After defeating the opponents)
:'''Arama:''' Nara {{Traveler}} is strong! May we never meet again, bad Fungi.
:'''Arama:''' We can "wake up" now! This Vasara Tree has agreed to bear a Vasoma Fruit for us.

;(The Traveler leaves the dream)

==Trivia==
* Some of the lines sung by Arayasa and the Traveler in their first encounter, are reference to several songs by a Japanese band called {{w|Sound Horizon}}.
** "The next song is a poem about a {{MC|m=young woman|f=young man}} in search of the thing most dear to {{MC|m=her|f=him}}." is one of the opening line from "Tadoritsuku Uta" {{Lang|ja=辿りつく詩}}: これより歌うは歌うは...ある娘が　大切なモノに辿りつく迄の詩 "What I am going to sing now... is a poem telling of a certain girl's experiences until she found what she held dear..."
** "Even if fate clouds your eyes... The song from your lips cannot be taken away..." is a reference to another line in "Tadoritsuku Uta": 「運命よ...例えお前が瞳から光を奪い去ろうとも　この唇からは詩を奪えない…」 "O destiny... even if you were to steal light from these eyes... You cannot take song from these lips..."
** "On the other side of the distant horizon..." might be a reference to the title of "Haruka Chiheisen no Kanata e -Horizontas-" {{Lang|ja=遥か地平線の彼方へ -- Οριζοντας}}.
