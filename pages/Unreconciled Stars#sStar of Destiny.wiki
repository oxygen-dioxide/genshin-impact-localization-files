{{Description|'"Surely, the fallen star that even the agents of chaos cannot ignore must be the abyss from whence this unholy darkness proceeds?"
<br>"Alright, let's pool our collective strength and deal with this latest and largest meteorite."}}
'''Star of Destiny''' is the third phase of the [[Unreconciled Stars]] event, unlocked after completing the Event Quest ''[[What the Skies Conceal, the Water Reveals]]''.

In this phase, players can complete '''Fallen Star''' challenges in either solo-player or Co-Op mode for ''[[Fading Star's Essence]]''.

Defeat monsters to accumulate celestial energy. Press the T key or tap the submit icon within the celestial energy submission zone to submit accumulated celestial energy. There is a limit to the amount of celestial energy that can be carried, so be sure to promptly submit your energy. If you are hit while submitting energy, the submission process is interrupted and you will lose the energy in your possession (when a certain astral anomaly is in effect, being interrupted during submission can even cause you to lose all your energy), so remain vigilant during the submission process.

During the '''Fallen Star''' challenge, a certain character may randomly receive a special character effect. Possible special effects include:
*Heroic Starburst: During the Fallen Star challenge, a certain character may receive the Heroic Starburst buff. During this time, the Heroic Starburst will intermittently increase the ATK of this character and all nearby characters.
*Fecund Starburst: During the Fallen Star challenge, a certain character may receive the Fecund Starburst buff. During this time, the Fecund Starburst will give this character and all nearby characters the Fecundity buff. Fecundity increases the efficiency of celestial energy submission.

==Quests==
This act is unlocked by completing the main quest ''[[What the Skies Conceal, the Water Reveals]]''. Afterward, there are three optional quests that you can complete for rewards:
* [[Unlimited Opportunity]]
* [[A Mysterious Loss]]
* [[Trouble With Letters]]

[[File:Tutorial Star of Destiny 2.png|200px|thumb|left]]Underneath the fallen star, submit the celestial energy you have obstained to advance the challenge progress. If you are hit while submitting energy, the submission process is cut short and you will <span style="color:orange;">lose the energy if your possession</span>. When a certain astral anomaly is in effect, being interrupted during submission can even cause you to lose all your energy. Other astral anomalies change the location for submission, amongst other things.
