'''Vamadha''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Sumeru]]. They are vine-like structures created by [[Aranara]] to block off places.

Vamadha can be interacted with by progressing in the {{Quest|Aranyaka}} and learning the Rhythm of Vamadha during the {{Quest|Vimana Agama: Royinjan's Chapter}}. After playing the Rhythm of Vamadha on the [[Vintage Lyre]], hitting the Vamadha will make it spin and reveal a path inside.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* ''Vamadha'' may be a combination of {{Lang|Vāma|sa={{wt|वाम||Sanskrit}}|sa_tl=left}} and {{Lang|Dhā|sa={{wt|धा||Sanskrit}}|sa_tl=to put," "to place," "towards}}. Thus, ''Vamadha'' could mean "to the left," as it turns to the left every time it is hit.
