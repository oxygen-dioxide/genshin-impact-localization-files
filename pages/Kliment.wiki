'''Kliment''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the [[Historia Antiqua Chapter]], Act I: [[Sal Flore]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
''(To be added.)''

===Personality===
Kliment is disdainful, greedy, and self-centered as demonstrated by the way he mistreats [[Wanyan]]. Kliment does not view any [[Archon]] relics as sacred, but rather for his own personal gain. Due to this, he will do anything for profit even if it was breaking a contract he agreed with.

===Appearance===
Kliment has a short mocha-colored hair and wears the typical Fatui uniform. Unlike the other Fatui members, he doesn't sport a mask.

==Story==
In Zhongli's Story Quest, Kliment would often impolitely deride and abuse [[Wanyan]] over her archaeology qualifications. Kliment was also extremely greedy for treasure rather than pursuing actual archaeological or historical knowledge.

When Kliment was deriding and mistreating Wanyan, Zhongli proposed that Kliment and Wanyan engage in a contract over how to split and share the treasures found in the ruins. When the materialistic Kliment breaks the contract out of excessive greed and wants to steal Wanyan's treasure, as punishment for breaking the contract, Zhongli and the Traveler enter a boss fight to beat Kliment up. After Kliment is defeated, he leaves the ruins.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, Sweet Salt}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Kliment can be fought during the Story Quest as a [[Fatui Pyro Agent]] with the name '''Fatui Kliment''' and the title "Self-Proclaimed Archeologist".

Although he acts similarly to a regular Fatui Agent, he is actually powered up: constantly shooting fireballs at the Traveler.
