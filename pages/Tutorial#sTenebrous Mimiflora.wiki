|text1    = An Abyssal monster that has descended to this world from the deep, dark depths of a twisted and alien world, the Tenebrous Mimiflora can mimic various phenomena, and can deploy a [[Void Ward]] in combat. Some of its attacks can cause stackable Attrition that, after a time, will cause your active character to lose HP. Use {{Color|help|a specific number of Elemental attacks}} to destroy this creature's Ward. {{Color|help|Nightsoul-aligned Elemental attacks}} can break through its defenses more effectively.
