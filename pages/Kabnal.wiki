==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xican:''' Hehe, now that it's come to this, you've just gotta give it your all.
:'''Xican:''' Not that you can do much aside from that, though.
:'''Kabnal:''' Teacher! Coach! Mentor! Please, I'm begging you: Stop making things sound so hopeless.
:'''Xican:''' Well, that's not in my hands. You can't even remember the hand gestures used to communicate with your companions. How can I let you go out there on the road... I mean, in the sky.
:'''Xican:''' The wind up there is way too strong for you to rely on shouting to communicate.
:'''Xican:''' One small slip in your hand gestures can send two Saurians colliding with each other at high speed. And if that happens, no amount of "giving it your all" is going to help.
:'''Kabnal:''' Sorry, I'm sorry! I'll do my best to memorize the texts! I won't forget next time!
:'''Kabnal:''' W&mdash;Well, I think I won't, anyway...
:'''Xican:''' Haha, then I can only "think" I can help you pass the test.
