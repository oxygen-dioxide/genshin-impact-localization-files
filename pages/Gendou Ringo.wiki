==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Gendou Ringo is in charge of the [[Fortune Slip]] Box and gives players their fortune based on the [[Bamboo Slip]] drawn that day.

Before [[Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips]] is started, the person acting as "Gendou Ringo" is a [[Shuumatsuban]] member who would later come to use the codename "[[Momoyo]]." During and after the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] and the [[The Very Special Fortune Slip]] quest line, the ex-Fatuus [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]] takes over as the new "Gendou Ringo".

===Personality===
====Momoyo====
Gendou Ringo initially has a curt and rather rude attitude that stands in stark contrast with her role as a shrine maiden. She also appears to hold little interest in being a shrine maiden, often failing to use the proper terminology and openly questioning the veracity of the fortune slips.

====Lyudochka====
Gendou Ringo has a much more approachable and friendly attitude toward the Traveler and Paimon in general and acts much more like a typical Shrine Maiden.

===Appearance===
Gendou Ringo wears the standard shrine maiden uniform consisting of a white ''kosode'' and red ''hakama'', white ''tabi'' socks, and regular ''okobo'' sandals with red straps. She has blue eyes and black hair cut into a chin-length bob, and although not so visible in-game, the front portions of her hair are separated with dark brown accessories.

;(First interaction)
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' You want a fortune slip?
:'''Paimon:''' Geez, she's so cold.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I'd like one...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Got it. Here's how it goes. First, shake this... thing over here.
:{{DIcon}} Isn't it called Fortune Slip Box?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Yes. A Bamboo Slip will drop out from it. Give it to me, and I'll give you a matching strip of paper.
:{{DIcon}} I'm pretty sure they say it's a Fortune Slip...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Whatever.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's got a question! If... What do we do if we get one that means bad luck?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' It's fate. You got a problem with that? Huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Eh!?
:{{DIcon}} Isn't there that shelf-like thing outside we can use to...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Tsk.
:'''Paimon:''' Did she seriously just say "tsk"?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Let me see... Oh right, so it's like this. "Tie the inauspicious slip onto the Fortune Slip Hanger to change ill fortune to good"...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Ah, right! If you get a slip with ill fortune, just tie it to that shelf, that'll do.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Huh, what a bunch of... No, sorry. We at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] are most gentle indeed. Even if you should draw a slip with bad luck, you shall have a chance to turn it around.
:'''Paimon:''' Something about this doesn't seem right...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go draw a fortune slip, (Traveler)!

;(After drawing a [[Bamboo Slip]] for the first time)
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Give me that bamboo slip.
:{{DIcon}} R&mdash;Right.
:'''Paimon:''' This shrine really seems to lack the whole divine affection thing, huh...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Here.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's see how our luck's going...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Ah, yes. You can only draw one fortune slip each day. Please remember that.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' It's too tiring otherwise... Wait, no. If not, you won't be able to use the Fortune Slip Hanger to... No, that's not right either. What was I supposed to say?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' "Fortune slips are the manifestation of our archon's will. It is our place as mortals to respect it and do all we can."
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' See? Elegantly put. So please remember, you can only draw one fortune slip each day.
