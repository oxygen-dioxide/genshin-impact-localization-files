|Earthquake Investigation
|The Adventurers' Guild has received reports of frequent earthquakes, and have ascertained that it is not the result of human activities such as mining or detonations. They need someone to investigate and remove the source of this threat quickly.<br>There have also been eyewitness reports of monsters in the are, so make sure to be fully prepared.

|The Geovishaps Gather
|An unusual number of Geovishap Hatchlings have suddenly gathered in this area, and given the relationship between them and Geovishaps, the Guild needs to investigate the wherefores here as soon as possible.<br>Geovishap Hatchlings are highly aggressive creatures, so be sure to clean them out in one fell swoop.
|{{Card|Mora|40000}}
|{{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}
|-
|Mysterious Bone Shards
|Many bone shards have been found scattered out in the wild.<br>Geovishap Hatchlings tend to carry these bone shards around and cherish them, so something must have changed for them to scattered about.<br>Investigate this matter, and take note of any changes to the surroundings.
|{{Card|Mora|40000}}
|{{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Hydro}}
|-
|New Material Test
|There has been hearsay that a Geovishap's carapace and bone shards are excellent material for forging weapons and armor, and a certain blacksmith has recklessly gone out on their own to search for some.<br>Find them and get them to come back &mdash; such behavior is far too dangerous.

|-
|Into the Cavern
|Adventurers have discovered a cavern here that didn't exist before. Its entrance is small, but it is exceedingly deep, and is said to lead to an open space within.<br>Be careful when heading in there &mdash; no one knows what might await.

|Lost in One's Fate
|Someone seems to have become convinced that these mysterious earthquakes are the call of destiny, and has gone to the epicenter of the quakes to search for a fated encounter.<br>All that awaits him, however, is danger. Please seek this lost lamb out and bring him back to the safety of Liyue Harbor.

|Supporting Battle
|The Geovishap Hatchling population has been exploding in recent days. The Millelith are having a hard time dealing with them, and have issued a call for assistance.

|Caravan Guard
|Caravans transporting high-value goods are currently on the move as scheduled. If they were to encounter a Geovishap, they might incur great loss.<br>Highly experienced adventurers are needed to defend these caravans and prevent any incidents.

|{{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Electro}}
|-
|Encrypted Communications?
|Someone has discovered that the gathered Geovishap Hatchlings are exceedingly agitated, constantly coming in and out of the holes that they have dug. He believes that there is some rhyme and reason to this, and that they might be sending some sort of message.<br>Whether such deductions are true or not, it is best to investigate it.
|{{Card|Guide to Resistance|2}}
|{{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}
|-
|Strange Rut
|Signs of strange ruts that are similar to those of a cart have been discovered here. However, these dimensions seem to be somewhat unusual.<br>Vishaps tend to roll about &mdash; so might these mysterious ruts have been left behind by such creatures?
|{{Card|Guide to Ballad|2}}
|{{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Cryo}}
|-
|Riches Wait for No One
|The Treasure Hoarders seem to also have heard of the Geovishaps. They have begun searching for these creatures, and have taken to threatening adventurers who have come out to explore.<br>Take these wealth-obsessed people out of the picture, and you might obtain some of the intelligence that they have gathered.
|{{Card|Guide to Prosperity|2}}
|{{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Hydro}}
|-
|Armor Maintenance
|Signs of vishaps polishing their armor have been discovered, and since these signs are far more obvious than those left by Geovishap Hatchlings, it can be deduced that Geovishaps have been around these parts.<br>Keep your wits about you as you investigate: the Geovishaps could be hiding just nearby.
|{{Card|Guide to Diligence|2}}
|{{Icon/Element|Electro}}{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}
|-
|Nocturnal Serpent
|A traveler reported in a panic that he encountered a snake large enough to blot out the stars the previous night. However, close listening reveals that the "snake"'s characteristics are very much like that of a vishap.<br>Head to the scene to investigate, and search for what clues you can.

|Vishap Bait
|An adventurer well-versed in vishap behavior has made a type of lure that can be used to sucker Geovishap Hatchlings in, but it is unknown if it would be as effective on Geovishaps.<br>Seasoned adventurers are needed to follow him to perform some tests &mdash; and to protect him if necessary.
|{{Card|Mora|30000}}
|{{Icon/Element|Electro}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
|Culinary Curiosity
|It seems that rumors about Geovishaps have being making the rounds, and that some have started to discuss the culinary potential of the creatures...<br>It may be best to keep watch over this area in case some chef willing to risk it all for the art of cooking comes knocking.
|{{Card|Mora|30000}}
|{{Icon/Element|Hydro}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
|Kinship
|Geovishaps and Geovishap Hatchlings are very closely related. As such, a comprehensive study of geovishap hatchling behavior should be of great help in Geovishap movements.<br>Go out and see how they live.
|{{Card|Hero's Wit|3}}
|{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
|Danger in the Dark
|The vishap family can hide in narrow or even sealed areas, and quite a few people have become victims of their sudden ambushes around these parts.<br>But adventurers are used to dealing with attacks from the shadows and have accumulated much experience in the field, both of which make them most suited to this task.

|On the Trail

|Drums in the Deep
|The commissioner claims that deep rumblings can be heard coming from underground nearby, and that these rumblings have been getting more frequent. For fear of getting into a tangle with a monster, they have asked for an experienced adventurer to investigate and take care of this anomaly.

|A Strange Stench
|The commissioner has followed a curious stench to a feeding ground. It appears as if some creature lived there at some point. The tracks are still fresh, so a careful search might yet yield up meaningful clues.

|Hollow Rock
|An adventurer felt the ground quake under their feet while exploring, and after some investigation, found that the seemingly solid stone ground had been hollowed out by Geovishap Hatchlings.<br>The Geovishap Hatchlings may wind up weakening the entire mountain if left to their own devices &mdash; they must be cleared out immediately.

|-
|Storms Come, Rocks Fall
|Many rocks have come tumbling down from the nearby mountains after a storm. The mountains of Liyue have always been stalwart &mdash; a mere storm should not have brought about a rockslide of this kind.<br>Adventurers, could you check this unusual situation out while clearing the fallen rocks away?

|Key Site Inspection
|Geovishaps seem to have emerged around these parts and could cause injuries and even fatalities if it appears in areas with many travelers. Adventurers, please patrol the area alongside the Millelith and find any signs of Geovishap presence.

|{{Icon/Element|Electro}}{{Icon/Element|Cryo}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}

|The Bottom of Things
|There must be some reason behind the sudden Geovishap activity. A better understanding of their aims will make guessing their moves simpler.<br>Collect news and information of this kind, and they may be of help to the investigation.

|{{Icon/Element|Hydro}}{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
|The Way Forward
|A single, exceedingly long track has been left in the earth, and though part of it has become obscured by dust, it is enough to guess at the creature's heading.<br>Once again, we must trouble adventurers skilled in tracking to investigate and collect all clues that may be of value to the investigation.
|{{Card|Hero's Wit|2}}
|{{Icon/Element|Anemo}}{{Icon/Element|Pyro}}{{Icon/Element|Geo}}
|-
|Dust Storm
|An abnormal sandstorm has started to rage in this area, and it is so thick that it sometimes makes it hard to breathe. This is a very rare meteorological phenomenon indeed. The Guild has deduced that this must have something to do with vishap living habits, and that the site must be filled with all manner of information.

|1||After a period of investigation, you finally have the Geovishaps' whereabouts locked down. These creatures are as strong as they are cunning, and they will not appear easily. Please head for the location provided by the Guild to eliminate the culprits behind these strange goings-on.
|{{Card|Hero's Wit|5}}
|{{Icon/Element|Cryo}}
|-
|2||The approximate location of yet more Geovishaps has been found via the accumulation of evidence. These creatures are adept in using elemental power to strengthen themselves, and even adventurers who have defeated one before must prepare sufficiently and never let down their guard.
|{{Card|Hero's Wit|5}}
|{{Icon/Element|Electro}}
|-
|3||The havoc that has been wreaked in various places all point towards Geovishaps, and they have been growing more active lately. The reason for their agitated unease remains unclear, but they must be hunted nonetheless in order to prevent them from attacking villages and cities.
|{{Card|Hero's Wit|5}}
|{{Icon/Element|Hydro}}
|-
|4||After much hard work adventuring, the Geovishaps no longer rampage as they please, and the abnormalities throughout the land have also decreased. But until the reason for their restlessness can be ascertained, there is still work to be done in hunting them and consolidating the gains made thus far.
