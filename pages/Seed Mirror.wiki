'''Seed Mirrors''' are a type of [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]] in [[Sumeru]]. They are found on top of the eight watchtowers scattered throughout [[Dharma Forest]].

Seed Mirrors can be used to locate [[#Nascent Withering Zones|nascent Withering Zones]]. While put in the Activated state using {{Electro}}, they can also be used to locate a nearby hidden [[Aranara]] (the [[Mischievous Aranara]]). While put in the Scorched state using {{Pyro}}, they cannot be used. If the Seed Mirror is within range of a Withering Zone, it cannot be used until the zone is cleared.

Seed Mirrors can be used to locate two nascent Withering Zones, which appear as a thin, black upwards trail from where the Tumor of the Withering is located. After a Nascent Withering Zone has been located, it will appear at the {{Icon|Nascent Withering Zone}} icon on the mini map, and there will be [[Four-Leaf Sigil]]s leading to it from the Seed Mirror that located. These will all remain until the Nascent Withering Zone has been cleared.

Unlike ordinary [[Withering Zone]]s, there is no Decay gauge or Withering Branches that need to be destroyed with [[Dendrograna]]. A few enemies will surround a Tumor of the Withering, which can be destroyed after the enemies are defeated. After it has been destroyed, a [[Common Chest]] will spawn.

==Trivia==
*Mischievous Aranara can be found even if the player has not yet unlocked any [[Statues of The Seven]] in Sumeru. (The Traveler encounters Aranara for the first time after unlocking any Statue of The Seven in [[Dharma Forest]].)
*Not all Seed Mirrors<!--only the one north of Pardis Dhyai?--> will trigger the Tutorial, even though all Seed Mirrors so far can detect nascent Withering Zones.
*The entrances to the Seed Mirror towers are typically locked by a barrier, which is dispelled after completing a nearby puzzle or completing various prerequisites. It is possible to bypass this barrier by gliding to the top of the tower, which automatically dispels the barrier upon landing on the tower's top level.
