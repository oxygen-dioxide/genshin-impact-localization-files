|description    = The Darkwing Goose is a large waterfowl that lives in ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water. It is a close relative of the [[Snow-Winged Goose]].<br>Due to its pitch-black plumage, the Darkwing Goose was once mistaken as the cursed form of the Snow-Winged Goose. And so, some superstitious [[Fontaine|Fontainians]] considered it an unusual, ill, and even catastrophic omen. But as the times changed, various artistic works gradually improved people's impressions of them...<br>Unlike the Snow-Winged Goose, for some reason, the Darkwing Geese in the Realm Within are always being ignored by the other animals. Even Tubby mistakenly assumed that the other animals were afraid of their black feathers, but later on, [[Tubby]] realized that the Darkwing Geese especially enjoy their solitude and intentionally avoid other animals. So, as time passed, the other animals grew even more accustomed to ignoring the Darkwing Geese...
