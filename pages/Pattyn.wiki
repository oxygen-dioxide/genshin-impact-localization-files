==Profile==
Pattyn is one of [[Chaussivert]]'s crew members. He was bought by [[Covault]] alongside [[Morgen]] to eliminate the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], [[Fusilier]] and [[Lemarcq]], who were trying to track [[Nacker]] after he stole an Arkhium core from the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. The ambush failed, and Pattyn was subdued. Returning to Chaussivert's ship, the Traveler realizes that [[Concini]], [[Loillier]] and Nacker were all in leagues with each other. Lemarcq suggested interrogating him and Morgen for information. Chaussivert then asked Pattyn if he knew the rules, which he did, leaving his former boss slightly pleased that he accepted the consequences of his own actions, before warning the others that it would not be a silent night.

It is heavily implied that during that night, after interrogation, Chaussivert and Lemarcq threw Pattyn and Morgen overboard after getting all they could from them, leaving them to drown in the sea.
