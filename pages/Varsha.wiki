==Profile==
Varsha is a young girl who originally came from [[Gandharva Ville]]. The full story behind her past and her reason for refusing to rely on adults is hinted at but left unrevealed: when she tells [[Paimon]] and the [[Traveler]] about her current situation, she says "I am much happier now than when I was in Gandharva Ville, and I don't get beaten," which may suggest that she was abused by someone in the village and ran away.

Before she wound up in her current location, she made her way to [[Vimara Village]], where she met a man who looked "nice enough." However, he attempted to kidnap her and was foiled by an [[Aranara]]. While she caught a glimpse of it, she had never seen one before and could only guess that it was a forest spirit. Since then, she has determined to live on her own, without the help of adults. The Aranara did not wipe her memories and deposited her in a cave protected by a [[Claustroflora]], where she remained for the time being.

Varsha's kidnapper is suggested to be [[Alphonso]], who was working under [[Il Dottore]]'s orders to capture Aranara. To that end, he and his group were kidnapping children to lure out the Aranara, although their numerous attempts all failed.

The Traveler and Paimon eventually discovered her in cave while clearing out a [[The Withering|Withering Zone]]. Learning why she was there, they offered to bring her to Vanarana, where a large amount of [[Sweet Flower]]s were growing in the real world as the Traveler helped [[Aranakula]] and [[Arakara]] grow [[Viparyas]] in the dream realm. Varsha was delighted to see the flowers and decided to take care of the flowers there, hoping that the Aranara would appear if she tended to the garden.

===Personality===
Due to her traumatic childhood, Varsha voluntarily chose to live by herself and distrusts adults, believing them to have malicious intentions. She enjoys plants and claims that she could survive on [[Starshroom]]s, [[Sweet Flower]]s and [[Mint]]s, eating like a "bird".

;(Approaching Varsha)
:'''Paimon:''' Strange, what's this kid doing here? Hey kid! Why are you here all alone?
:'''???:''' Ah! A weird person, and a weird flying person.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey! That's rude!
:'''???:''' Yeah, that's right. Rude's my middle name. Didn't even have parents to teach me "manners," don'cha know?
:{{DIcon}} (There's a story behind this for sure...)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Anyway, we aren't weird people, and we definitely aren't bad guys.
:{{DIcon}} We're just a pair of kind travelers.
::'''Paimon:''' Exactly. And that's why we don't leave those who are troubled behind.
:{{DIcon}} We're looking for my lost {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}}...
::'''Paimon:''' Yes. So of course we got worried when we saw a little girl like you here all alone! We just can't leave you like this knowing that you might need help.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's name is Paimon, and this is (Traveler). Might we know your name?
:'''Varsha:''' My name's Varsha...
:'''Paimon:''' And why are you here all alone, Varsha? We can escort you back if you're lost.
:'''Varsha:''' No. The past should stay in the past. I've decided to move on.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Varsha:''' I can't rely on adults. I must go my own way...
:'''Paimon:''' What's with this old-person talk...? You are just a kid! Anyway, the forest can be pretty dangerous. A kid like you isn't gonna be able to handle it.
:'''Varsha:''' Some bad guy tried to take me away earlier... But it's okay. I'm more careful now. I'll be able to avoid danger.
:'''Varsha:''' He was a guy from [[Vimara Village]], and he looked nice enough. But as it turns out, he was no different from those adults I met before...
:'''Paimon:''' You almost got taken away by some bad guy!? You haven't learned your lesson at all, then! Wait, and how did you manage to get away last time, anyway?
:'''Varsha:''' Some small creature whisked me to this place. I've never seen something this small in [[Gandharva Ville]], so I believe that it had to be a forest spirit.
;(If [[The Viparyas of Vanarana]] has not been completed)
::{{DIcon}} (It could be an Aranara.)
;(If The Viparyas of Vanarana has already been completed)
::{{DIcon}} (That should be an Aranara.)
:'''Paimon:''' (That said, could "that guy from Vimara Village" refer to...)
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, it's still not safe for kids to be alone in the forest. You might encounter all kinds of dangers, like...
:{{DIcon}} Running into dangerous Fungi.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! And villains such as Nara Marana. Ugh, no, Paimon meant to say...
:{{DIcon}} You might run into bad guys that might try to kidnap you.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! What (Traveler) said! Or... or you might starve!
:'''Varsha:''' It's impossible to starve in a forest full of nature's gifts. [[Starshroom]]s, [[Sweet Flower]]s, and [[Mint]]s are everywhere, and I eat like a bird anyway.
:'''Varsha:''' And I've always been pretty good at taking care of plants, so finding a safe place to plant some Sweet Flowers or Mints to feed myself won't be a problem.
:'''Varsha:''' Haha, a garden full of Sweet Flowers... Wouldn't that be paradise?
;(If the Sweet Flowers have not been encountered from The Viparyas of Vanarana quest)
::'''Paimon:''' What a sweet daydream she's having, eh...
::'''Varsha:''' Anyway, I am much happier now than when I was in Gandharva Ville, and I don't get beaten... I appreciate your kindness. But right now, it'd be for the best if you left me alone...
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon doesn't know what she's been through, but it seems like it would be hard to convince her to return.
::'''Paimon:''' To be fair, things don't look too dangerous around here... Let's come back and see her later if chance allows. Maybe she'll have changed her mind by then.

:;(Talk to Varsha prior to completing Viparyas of Vanarana)
::'''Varsha:''' As long as there are seeds, I can grow more Sweet Flowers. But bread is different. You can't plant bread.
::'''Varsha:''' If bread could break in half and grow back again, no one would ever go hungry...

:;(Talk to Varsha after completing The Viparyas of Vanarana)
::'''Paimon:''' Hi Varsha! You're still here, huh?
::'''Varsha:''' Paimon. (Traveler). Good to see you. I'm doing well here. There's nothing for you to worry about.
::'''Paimon:''' You've persevered, huh...
::'''Varsha:''' Are you still trying to persuade me? I'm not going anywhere with you. Not at all...
::'''Paimon:''' Well... we're not gonna force you to do anything. Remember what you said about "a garden full of Sweet Flowers"?
::'''Varsha:''' Ah... It was a wishful thinking actually. I know there isn't such a place.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... This maturity still feels weird coming from a kid.
::'''Paimon:''' Guess what? We've got good news!
::{{DIcon}} There really is a garden full of Sweet Flowers.
::'''Paimon:''' Yes! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called Aranara.
::'''Paimon:''' We know this, 'cause we've helped plant many Viparyas for them.
::{{DIcon}} We helped the earth to remember.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. According to Aranakula, Vanarana remembers everything, so the Viparyas can sprout in the garden once the land remembers them again.
::'''Varsha:''' ...I've heard a lot of stories like this before, and only kids take them seriously. But I know you said this with good intentions, Paimon, so thank you.
::'''Paimon:''' Aren't you a kid as well? And Paimon's not telling stories. Paimon means it for real!
::'''Varsha:''' Yeah. That's what every storyteller says.
::'''Paimon:''' If you don't believe us... Well, seeing is believing! Come with us and see for yourself!
::'''Varsha:''' Wait, you've really prepared a place to fit your story? Now I'm getting curious.
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, Paimon's telling you the truth...
::'''Paimon:''' Let's take her to the Aranara's garden, (Traveler). That should silence her doubts once and for all.

;(If the Sweet Flowers have already been encountered from The Viparyas of Vanarana quest)
::'''Paimon:''' A garden full of Sweet Flowers, huh... Ooh, Paimon remembers that there were many in the garden we took care of for the Aranara!
::'''Varsha:''' Wait. Are you saying that there really is a paradise like that out there, Paimon?
::'''Paimon:''' Yup! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called the Aranara.
::'''Paimon:''' We know this, 'cause we've helped plant many Viparyas for them.
::{{DIcon}} We helped the earth to remember.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. According to Aranakula, Vanarana remembers everything, so the Viparyas can sprout in the garden once the land remembers them again.
::'''Varsha:''' ...I've heard a lot of stories like this before, and only kids take them seriously. But I know you said this with good intentions, Paimon, so thank you.
::'''Paimon:''' Aren't you a kid as well? And Paimon's not telling stories. Paimon means it for real!
::'''Varsha:''' Yeah. That's what every storyteller says.
::'''Paimon:''' If you don't believe us... Well, seeing is believing! Come with us and see for yourself!
::'''Varsha:''' Wait, you've really prepared a place to fit your story? Now I'm getting curious.
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, Paimon's telling you the truth...
::'''Paimon:''' Let's take her to the Aranara's garden, (Traveler). That should silence her doubts once and for all.

:'''Varsha:''' If there really are Aranara, will they also like Sweet Flowers? Oh... It would be so nice if I could meet them.
:{{DIcon}} About Aranara...
::'''Varsha:''' Aranakula and Arakara... Am I saying them right? I remember you guys mentioning Aranara names.
::'''Varsha:''' I haven't managed to meet them yet... But, say, if I sing here, will they hear me? Will they like it?
:{{DIcon}} Take good care of yourself.
::'''Varsha:''' I'll be fine. You guys take care too.
