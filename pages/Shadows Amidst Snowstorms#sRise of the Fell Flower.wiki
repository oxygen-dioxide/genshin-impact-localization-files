|text1   = The Fellflower contains a mysterious substance known as Arcane Essence. Or perhaps it is this substance that has given the Fellflower its current form...<br />If you can get rid of this Arcane Essence, you may make the Fellflower easier to defeat...
|image2  = Tutorial Shadows Amidst Snowstorms_Fellflower Challenge 2.png
|text2   = After the Fellflower summons Arcane Fruits, you can attack and destroy them to reflect them back at the Fellflower, hitting it hard and decreasing its shielding. Such impacts will also cause the Fellflower to release Arcane Essence.
|image3  = Tutorial Shadows Amidst Snowstorms_Fellflower Challenge 3.png
|text3   = Pick up the Fellflower's Arcane Essence to prevent its shield from regenerating. However, your active character will continually lose HP for a time when they pick up Arcane Essence.
|image4  = Tutorial Shadows Amidst Snowstorms_Fellflower Challenge 4.png
|text4   = Picking up Arcane Essences will allow you to prevent the Fellflower from regenerating its shield. Once the Fellflower's shield has been removed completely, it will decrease in size and become easier to defeat.
