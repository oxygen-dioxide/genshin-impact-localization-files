==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
Vsevolod has been working in Sumeru City longer than Viktor has, and Viktor was assigned to assist him. Though he works with "logistics," the details of his work are unclear, though he is likely working on opening a branch of the [[Northland Bank]], given that Viktor is handling the bank's business in Sumeru in the meantime.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Kalimi Exchange Bulletin Board|Northland Bank Notice}}</ref> He is particularly sensitive to confidentiality, and he likely would not approve of Viktor mentioning the specific Harbinger ([[Pulcinella]]) whose command he is under.<ref name="EE" />

===Personality===
Vsevolod is apparently enthusiastic about his work in Sumeru.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Viktor|s=2}}</ref> However, Viktor suspects that despite his positive attitute towards work, he might be homesick since he has been unable to return to his family in Snezhnaya for a long time.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Equivalent Exchange Once More|note=Second Commission #1}}</ref>
