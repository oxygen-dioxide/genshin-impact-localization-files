==Profile==
Arbon and Alberre come from the same village as [[Armand]]. Armand's stutter &mdash; suspected to be caused by a long-lasting injury after falling out of his seat during a comedy show &mdash; has been a stumbling block in his goal of becoming a comedian, so he began working at Leschots' competitor, [[Lepaute Horlogerie]]. Arbon remarks to Alberre that Armand's stutter has been improving recently.

====Dialgoue Set #1====
''Available after completing ''[[The Toy War: Shots Fired]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arbon:''' Have you heard? [[Armand]]'s been doing much better recently. He still gets nervous when there are too many people, but he can at least express what he means.
:'''Alberre:''' Well, he'd better be! How will he become a comedian if he stutters in front of people?
:{{DIcon}} Armand?
:'''Arbon:''' The staff member at Lepaute Horlogerie. You haven't seen him?
:'''Alberre:''' He's from the same village as us, and he wants to act in comedies. Unfortunately, he has a terrible stutter.
:'''Arbon:''' They say that it's a long-term effect of him having fallen from the audience seats and hitting his head at a comedy show.
:'''Alberre:''' I really liked that comedy too. I recall that it was called "Judgment," but nowadays, I feel like I can't really enjoy it.
:'''Arbon:''' I mean, the kid who wanted to become a comic actor was judged during a comedy called "Judgment"... and his sentence was to never become one.
:'''Alberre:''' Poor Armand. What sin did he commit, and who was his judge?
:'''Arbon:''' Who can say?

====Dialgoue Set #2====
''Available after completing ''[[The Toy War: Heating Up]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arbon:''' Have you seen the evaluation board? Seems like someone likes those clockwork penguins.
:'''Alberre:''' I saw it. It's the one that talks about wanting to get to know [[Freminet]], right? Sounds like someone who would like to strike up some further collaboration, if you ask me.
:{{DIcon}} Freminet?
::'''Arbon:''' Oh, we're talking about those clockwork penguins on that table. A diver named Freminet made them, and he then placed them in our store as a consignment.
::'''Alberre:''' He's a good lad with a pretty face. Soft-spoken fellow, but he's very good at making toys.
::'''Arbon:''' He seems a little melancholy, though. Like someone who lacks something that should've belonged to him...
::'''Alberre:''' I know that look, y'know &mdash; it's the same one that Arbon makes when he looks at his empty wallet. Don't suppose Freminet's in need of Mora, do you?
:{{DIcon}} Clockwork penguins?
:'''Arbon:''' Don't be ridiculous. He didn't even discuss the profit-split when he came to talk about the consignment. He wasn't in it for the Mora.
:'''Alberre:''' True. But what else would trouble a lad of his age?
:'''Arbon:''' Yeah, and he's a winsome fellow, too. I haven't seen [[Livre|the boss]] ever approve of a consignment.
:'''Arbon:''' He not only offered to set up an outdoor stall for the penguins, but even proposed a fifty-fifty split on the earnings.
:'''Alberre:''' Unfortunately, one could only call the sales middling. Many people came to look, sure, but there weren't many buyers.
:'''Alberre:''' That toy is very intricately designed, but I'd say that also makes it harder to play with... and harder to fix.
:'''Arbon:''' Really, I didn't expect that anyone would leave a message about it on the board. Maybe there's a big client behind it, eh?
:'''Alberre:''' Either way, we should tell the boss about it. Won't do to miss out on a good deal, you know?
