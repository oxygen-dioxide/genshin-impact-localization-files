|text      = A few days ago, a child came to me, eager to learn swordsmanship and dreaming of becoming a hero. Taking on the mantle of a mentor is no laughing matter, and I'm well aware of my own limits. Yet neither could I bear to extinguish the light in his eyes, shining like stars. Truly, a quandary...

Given your vast knowledge and experience, might I trouble you to join me in planning a proper solution?

Haha, well, I know you won't be fooled by that pretext, so allow me to just explain the truth of the matter in full. There is indeed a child seeking a master, and I already suggested that he start by reading a few martial arts novels that I gifted him, and if, after finishing them, his heart still yearns for the life of a wandering chivalric hero, I'll help him find a worthy teacher, and he did agree. However, he had one more request. He wishes for me to write a personal message in one of the books as encouragement.

This... Alas... Ah! The difficulty therein, I think only you would understand...

I've arranged a private room for you at the inn, with the finest food and drink, and, of course, all the stationery you might need. I humbly ask that you lend a helping pen and write a few words of inspiration. Your help would mean the world to me!
