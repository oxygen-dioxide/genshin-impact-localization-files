==Trivia==
* In several languages other than English, this achievement's name makes a direct reference to the ''{{w|Magic: The Gathering}}'' card [[w:c:mtg:Chaos Orb|Chaos Orb]], which is currently not legal in any tournament format. Chaos Orb is played by physically flipping it onto the play area, and removes any cards or tokens in play that it happens to land on. There is an urban legend that a player once won a tournament by tearing the card to pieces in order to destroy all of their opponent's cards and tokens at once.
