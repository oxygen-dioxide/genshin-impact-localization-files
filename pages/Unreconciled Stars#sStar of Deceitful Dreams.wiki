[[File:Unreconciled Stars Meteorite Remains.png|150px|right|thumb|Meteorite Remains]]
'''Star of Deceitful Dreams''' is the second phase of the [[Unreconciled Stars]] event, unlocked after completing the Event Quest ''[[The Crisis Deepens]]''.

In this phase, you can challenge '''Meteorite Strike Zones''', locations where Meteorite Remains can be found. By defeating waves of enemies, players can salvage the energy contained to obtain rewards.
==Quests==
This act is unlocked by completing the main quest ''[[The Crisis Deepens]]''. Afterward, there are three optional quests that you can complete for rewards:
*[[The Siege of Qingce]]
*[[Contingencies]]
*[["That Guy"'s Scheme]]

==Tutorial==
[[File:Tutorial Star of Deceitful Dreams 1.png|200px|thumb|left]]Thankfully, Mona has been able to pinpoint the destinations of falling meteorites. Interact with meteorite remains at the landing sites to salvage them.

[[File:Tutorial Star of Deceitful Dreams 2.png|200px|thumb|left]]When salvaging meteorites, you must first defeat the opponents in the vicinity of the meteorite's remains to advance your Salvage Progress. Stray too far from the meteorite remains and your Salvage Progress will decrease. If you do not reach max Salvage Progress within the time limit, salvaging will fail.

[[File:Tutorial Star of Deceitful Dreams 3.png|200px|thumb|left]]Meteorite remains emit concentrated elemental energy that strengthens surrounding opponents. If you use Elemental Attacks to create reactions that will remove the elemental enhancements benefiting the monsters, defeating them and salvaging the meteorite remains will be much easier.

;Salvaging Meteorite Remains
:There are three levels to choose from when salvaging meteorite remains: shards, shells, and cores. The amount of energy dispersed from a meteorite's remains increases with its scale, and greater amounts of energy attract more formidable opponents to join you in battle. Consequently, the combat difficulty increases with the Salvage Level.
;Salvage Progress
:Defeat opponents to advance your Salvage Progress. If you stray too far from the meteorite remains during salvaging, the meteorite will lose energy and your Salvage Progress will decrease. Reach max Salvage Progress within the time given to successfully salvage the meteorite, otherwise salvaging will fail.
;Meteorite Impact
:During battles to salvage Fading Star's Might, the energy secreted by the meteorite remains will disturb the ley line flow and have an effect on surrounding opponents. Affected opponents will become more violent and gain elemental protection. Salvaging the meteorite remains may become much easier if you can find a way to destroy the elemental protection by causing an elemental reaction.
;New Meteorites
:You can find out the locations of the latest fallen meteorites from selecting the {{DIcon|Mona}} icon on the map, then talking to Mona. You must salvage all existing meteorite remains present in the world before you can learn the locations of new meteorites from Mona.

==Rewards==

==Notes==
*The player can only salvage using [[Original Resin]]. [[Condensed Resin]] isn't usable.
*You can join someone else's world in [[Co-Op Mode]] and participate in the salvage (including obtaining salvage rewards) without completing the prerequisite quest "[[The Crisis Deepens]]." However, salvages before completing the quest will not count toward progress for event rewards.
*While '''Meteorite Strike Zones''' are similar to [[Ley Line Outcrops]], enemies spawned by the '''Meteorite Strike Zones''' do not grant character experience/drops.
