|description    = A multipurpose low table made from [[Ashen Aratiku Wood]]. Its advantages lie in its simple structure, low cost, and ease of use, and it can be found in the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. The name "Countless Services" is indicative of these advantages. Aside from having the functions of an ordinary table, it can also serve as a display rack; and in a pinch, it can even be used as a footstool. Additionally, it is relatively light and can easily be moved off to different locations at low cost, and can be manufactured and used in large quantities. A true paradigm of furniture design.
