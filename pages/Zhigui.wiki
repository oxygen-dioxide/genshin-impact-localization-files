==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zhigui:''' The work is getting more and more complicated, so we'll need to take extra caution when handling affairs...
:'''Zhigui:''' Hmm? Hello there, welcome!
:{{DIcon}} What do you do here?
::'''Zhigui:''' Thanks for asking! To put it simply, I'm responsible for liaison work between the Communications Office's Hezhe Post and the Millelith, the teahouses, the Secure Transport Agency, and other organizations.
::'''Zhigui:''' If the leader of a group of guards for hire has guards waiting to be dispatched, I'll go get an order from Hezhe Post.
::'''Zhigui:''' If the teahouse sends someone here to confirm a tea delivery order on its behalf, I'll direct them to talk to the appropriate harbor staff to discuss the details.
::'''Zhigui:''' If a merchant wants make a large shipment to a foreign port and needs to have his goods inspected and registered first, I'll connect them to a specialist at Hezhe Post...
::{{DIcon}} It sounds like you've got a lot to do...
::'''Zhigui:''' It can't be helped. After all, Yilong Wharf is a busy port with people coming and going all the time. Without someone in charge of coordinating all this activity, everything becomes a big mess in a big hurry.
::'''Zhigui:''' Sometimes, I don't even have time to enjoy a nice pot of tea with Gaming when he comes back... He's also always busy as a bee, heh.
::'''Zhigui:''' Good thing Gaming has made so many friends here, so he doesn't need the likes of me worrying about him.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it then, bye.
::'''Zhigui:''' It was my pleasure. See you next time!
