|description    = A traveler once encountered a stone of this kind on a mountain top near a sheer cliff, thought it was a broken-off piece of cloud, and called it "Stratus-Cloud Stone." This story always stimulates intense curiosity in children who hear it &mdash; if shards of cloud are made of stone, does that mean there could be strange people secretly living up in the clouds?
