==Profile==
Kurosawa once belonged to the [[Tenryou Commission]] who helped enforce the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], but his very own Vision was stripped from him when he was deemed unworthy to serve the [[Raiden Shogun]]. He possesses a katana as a gift from his father, who once wielded it and bore his life's creed, "Virtue and Justice".<!--voiceover "katana", subtitle "blade" or "sword"-->

Prior to losing his Vision, Kurosawa had regularly bought large amounts of food from [[Aoi]], who runs [[Tsukumomono Groceries]]. Kurosawa would then distribute them as emergency provisions to the residents, despite actually purchasing them at his own expense and running into debt with her. Since he did not reveal this to the residents, he received backlash for "hoarding" food when the residents stopped receiving their provisions.

Kurosawa was one of the three people that the [[Traveler]] met per [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]]'s request. They found him arguing with the locals over hoarding food and upon further investigation, learned what he had been doing. After Aoi remarked about his katana, the Traveler asked him about it and wondered where the people he was arguing with went. Kurosawa revealed that he had threatened them with his katana but refrained from actually attacking them as he was unable to do so. After looking at what was inscribed on the katana, he was unsure of what to do with himself.

After the Vision Hunt Decree was abolished, Kurosawa's Vision was returned to him and he was restored to his original self.

===Personality===
Kurosawa's ambition was to make others happy even at his own expense. Despite having his Vision seized, he retained his instincts to avoid harming others, leading to self-doubt.

===Appearance===
Kurosawa Kyounosuke wears a  lavender ''shitagi'', indigo ''kobakama'', and he is barefoot in ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with dark gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is also wearing ''sode'' (shoulder armor) on his left shoulder. Kurosawa carries a ''katana'' at his hips on the left side with the blade facing down.
