|description = As the curtain rises on the Fontinalia Film Festival, it seems that everyone's where they should be — the director, the producer, the art director, and of course, the actors themselves...<br>Now, all that's left is to time it so the muskets fire and the roses bloom only at the perfect moments. We'll leave that to you lot then.

* New "Artifact Locking" function, where you can add, set, and activate different Artifact settings by going into your Inventory > Artifacts > Artifact Auto-Lock menu. After you have activated "Artifact Auto-Lock," you will automatically lock 5-star Artifacts that meet said settings upon gaining them.

;Genius Invokation TCG
* New Card Box "[[Fontaine (Card Box)|Fontaine]]" can be purchased from [[Prince]] at [[The Cat's Tail]] after reaching [[Player Level]] 8.
* Adds 12 new Open World Players. Reach Player Level 3 to unlock 4 new Open World Players located at [[Windwail Highland]], and reach Player Level 10 to unlock the other 8 Open World Players located at [[Romaritime Harbor]] and the [[Court of Fontaine]].
* The Forge Realm's Temper is once again available. The theme of this edition is "The Forge Realm's Temper: Game of Wits":
** During The Forge Realm's Temper: Game of Wits, some stages will have special victory and defeat conditions. Adeptly adapt your tactics to complete the challenge and avoid the conditions for defeat!
** Within The Forge Realm's Temper: Game of Wits event stages, there will also be special rules that can easily exert influence on the tempo of the match. Fully utilizing these special rules will contribute greatly to your success.

;Spiral Abyss
* The "[[Marechaussee Hunter]]" and "[[Golden Troupe]]" Artifact set rewards in "[[Domain Reliquary: Tier I]]" and "[[Domain Reliquary: Tier II]]" for Spiral Abyss Floors 9–12 will be replaced with the "Song of Days Past" and the "Nighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods" sets.
* Floor 11 Ley Line Disorder changed to:
** All party members receive a 75% Geo DMG Bonus.
* Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 4.3, the two Lunar Phases will be as follows:
** Phase I: Sturdy Moon
*** After a character obtains an Elemental Shard created by the Crystallize reaction, they will gain the Redoubtable state. Active characters in this state deal 15% increased DMG. This state lasts for 8s and can stack up to 3 times, with the duration of each stack counted independently.
** Phase II: Bursting Moon
*** After a character obtains an Elemental Shard created by the Crystallize reaction, it will be counted. When the count reaches 3, a shockwave will be released at the character's location, dealing True DMG to nearby opponents, and resetting the count. 1 such shockwave can be triggered every 6s.

==Adjustments & Optimizations==
;Enhancement Systems
* Pop-ups will no longer appear when carrying out enhancements from the [[Character]] Leveling, [[Weapon]] Enhancement, and [[Artifact]] Enhancement screens. Enhancement information will be integrated into the original screen instead.
* When previewing rewards for defeating [[Enemies of Note]] and [[boss]]es, [[Character Level-Up Material]]s will appear nearer to the front.
* Each time you enhance a weapon, you can now consume up to 40 materials instead of just 20. You will also be able to select multiple [[Refinement Material]]s at the same time when refining weapons.
* Adjusts the Weapon Refinement Mora consumption rules: When using a Weapon with a Refinement Level that isn't 1 for refining other Weapons, the amount of Mora consumed will be converted based on the Refinement Level (e.g. before the update, refining 4-star Weapons with an original Refinement Level of 1 would always cost 1,000 Mora, regardless of the Refinement Level of the Weapons being used as Refinement Materials. After the update, the amount of Mora required will be converted based on the Refinement Materials).
* On the [[Character]] > Level Up screen, the speed of special effects when leveling up characters has been increased, and you can now use Auto Add to add sufficient [[Character EXP Material]]s to get the character up to the highest level they can currently reach with a single click.

;Artifacts
* On the "Artifact Enhancement" screen, you can now add up to 15 [[Artifact]]s each time you enhance an Artifact.
* The "Enhance to Next Tier" function has been added to the "Artifact Enhancement" screen: After this function is enabled, when there are still open slots to add Enhancement Materials but the current action will already cause the Artifact to reach Level 4/8/12/16, no more additional Enhancement Materials will be automatically added beyond those necessary to reach the next tier.
* From the [[Paimon Menu]] > [[Settings]] > Other, you can choose whether or not 5-Star Artifacts can be auto-added as Artifact Enhancement Materials.
* The filter function on the Inventory > Artifacts screen has been adjusted: Interactivity logic has been updated to support more filter conditions, as well as filtering multiple sets at the same time.
* You can now select up to 3 affixes when sorting Artifacts (previously, you could only select a maximum of 2).
* On the [[Crafting Bench]]'s "[[Mystic Offering]]" screen, you can now add multiple Artifacts at the same time with a single click.

Travelers can also read Version 4.3's "Artifact Auto-Lock and Filter Function Update Preview" that was previously published to learn more about the updated Artifact Auto-Filter and Locking functions.

;Serenitea Pot
* Adds Multi-Select Mode to the [[Serenitea Pot]]'s editing screen, allowing you to drag-select multiple [[furnishing]]s to move, store, and create custom sets in bulk.
* Optimizes the logic of the Serenitea Pot's editing screen: When in Single-Select Mode, clicking the blank area will confirm placement, whereas clicking another furnishing will switch to selecting the corresponding furnishing.
* Adds serial numbers to the Serenitea Pot's Replica screen.
* In the Serenitea Pot, when your [[Realm Currency]] is full, the NPC [[Tubby]]'s dialogue option for going to redeem it ("Trust Rank") will light up.
* Optimizes the Serenitea Pot's Furnishing Schematics screen.
** When you've started creating furnishings or switch back to the Furnishing Schematics screen from another furnishing creation screen, the list of Furnishing Schematics will no longer refresh and cause you to lose your selected position.
** A source link to the "Convert [[Wood]]" screen has been added for wood materials on the Furnishing Schematics screen.
** On the Furnishing Schematics screen, Teapot Spirit Trust Rank markers will no longer be displayed for furnishings that you haven't made before but are currently in the process of making (if you cancel creation before they're finished, the marker will show again).

;Genius Invokation TCG
* Even if you haven't unlocked the Dynamic Skins for the Character Cards "Cyno," "Tartaglia," "Xiao," and "Wanderer," the card portrait will still change with the skill effect after using certain skills.

;Other Systems
* Adjusts the scroll bar's response area on certain screens.
* On the [[map]] screen, you can now check [[boss]]es' current remaining respawn times by clicking their avatars.
* [[Chat]] records from before the current day will now show the year, date, and time (previously, only the date and time were shown).
* On the [[Crafting]]/[[Cooking]]/[[Forging]]/[[Creation|Create Furnishing]] screens, if there are no selected [[character]] records on the Traveler's device, the first character that can provide a bonus when creating the selected item will be chosen by default.
* Adds the "Claim All" button to the "Dispatch Character on [[Expedition]]" screen, allowing you to claim Expedition Rewards with a single click. You'll also be able to use the "Dispatch Again" button on the "Expedition Results" screen to repeat expeditions with a single click.
* Adds the "Claim All" button to the "[[Process]]" and "[[Forge]]" screens, allowing you to claim processed ingredients and forged items that have been completed with a single click.
* Optimizes the interaction experience of the [[Adventure Handbook]]'s Enemies tab.
** You can now select "Cancel Navigation" on this screen to stop navigating towards a certain enemy on the map and the corresponding avatar (except boss enemies) will no longer appear on the map.
** Adjusts the way enemies' avatars display so that more can be displayed.

;Audio
* Optimizes the voice-over performance when the Character Card "[[Tartaglia (Character Card)|Tartaglia]]" uses his Elemental Burst under different stances in Genius Invokation TCG.
* Optimizes the audio performance when the combat phase changes in the [[Trounce Domain]] "[[Shadow of Another World]]."

;Other

* "[[The Chasm Delvers]]" quest series will no longer be prerequisites for the [[Archon Quest]] "[[In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion]]." When you reach the objective "Enter The Chasm: Underground Mines" in the Archon Quest "In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion," a [[Teleport Waypoint]] will be automatically unlocked in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] so you can continue with the Archon Quest.
* When a [[Gadget]] cannot be used, its button icon will no longer be hidden. This means that when characters are moving underwater, you will no longer be prevented from quickswapping Gadgets due to the icon having disappeared because the current Gadget can't be used.
* Characters' summons will no longer attack "[[Hydro Portal]]s" in the open world.
* Adjusts the barrier along the edges of the [[Spiral Abyss]] Domains: Upon approaching the barrier, the camera will not zoom in onto the character.
* When entering [[Domains of Blessing]], [[Domains of Mastery]], [[Domains of Forgery]], as well as when re-challenging these Domains, characters will now enter closer to the challenge location.
* When re-challenging Domains, Trounce Domains, and the Spiral Abyss, if party members' skills are in [[CD]], the CD will be reset.

* Adjusts the Elemental Dice cost for the Event Card "[[Wind and Freedom]]": The Elemental Dice cost required will be adjusted from 1 to 0.
* Adjusts the Elemental Dice cost for the Event Card "[[Joyous Celebration]]": The Elemental Dice cost required will be adjusted from 1 to 0.
* Adjusts summon effects for the Character Card "[[Rhodeia of Loch (Character Card)|Rhodeia of Loch]]": Only 2 Hydro Mimics can exist simultaneously on the field now. Hydro Mimics: Frogs: The number of Usages that can decrease DMG taken by the active character is adjusted from 2 to 1.
