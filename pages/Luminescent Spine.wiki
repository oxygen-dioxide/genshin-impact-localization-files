'''Luminescent Spines''' can be obtained by capturing [[Firefly|Fireflies]]. Normal fireflies can be generated by whacking bushes at night, or can be found naturally floating in the landscape at night.

==How to Obtain==
* Normal fireflies will discombobulate if a player dashes towards them, making them difficult to catch (often with the message ''Entity has timed out and disappeared''). However, simply walking towards them does not cause this behavior, making it easier to collect their spines.
* [[Lucklight Fly|Lucklight Flies]] can be found in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] and [[Malachitin Lumibug]]s can be found in [[Chenyu Vale]]. Much like [[Crystalflies]], Lucklight Flies will start to fly away and then dissipate when the player gets too close to them.
