'''Swimming''' is an [[Exploration]] mechanic upon reaching deep [[water]], where the water is too deep for the character to stand in. Thresholds for deep water vary based on the character's height. Swimming consumes [[Stamina]].

Like [[Climbing]] and [[Gliding]], the player cannot perform combat abilities while swimming.

An overwhelming majority of enemies cannot swim and drown instantly when they enter deep water. Thresholds for deep water vary based on the enemy's height. Some enemies such as [[Hydro Slime]]s are immune to drowning.

==Trivia==
* When a character jumps in a direction such that they will land in deep water, their jump animation is changed into a diving animation. Very short characters will do a cannonball jump into the water instead.
