|description    = A workstation made from high-quality [[Brightwood]], it looks like an ordinary table with an intricate mechanism underneath. Its internal structure is quite similar to clockwork. Simply turning the mechanism will allow one to store energy within the desk. This energy powers the rotation of the turntable, facilitating the pottery-making process. It is said that this particular design was inspired by similar products in [[Liyue]] that were then adapted by researchers to [[Sumeru]]'s local conditions, arts, and materials. When this workstation became popular, Sumeru's earthenware production capacity also greatly increased.
