:'''Lanty:''' I can't work anymore. What am I going to do...
:{{DIcon}} What's your job?
:;(Before completing ''[[Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble]]'')
:::'''Lanty:''' I am... Uh, I used to be a clerk in 5th Finances Office at the Fontaine Research Institute.
:;(After completing ''Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble'')
:::'''Lanty:''' Hello, Honorary Senior Researcher. I'm so happy to see you...
:::'''Lanty:''' I used to be a clerk in 5th Finances Office at the Fontaine Research Institute.
::'''Lanty:''' I was at the Maison Gestion discussing the delivery of some reports when the institute blew up. So I was lucky enough to, you know... not get blown up...
::'''Lanty:''' But our office and all our financial reports were blown to smithereens.
::'''Lanty:''' I mean, it's not bad news. But it's not good news, either...
::{{DIcon}} Why isn't it bad news?
::'''Lanty:''' Because... There used to be numerous projects running at the Fontaine Research Institute, and each one would always be applying to purchase this or that resource. The volume was simply enormous.
::'''Lanty:''' In accordance with regulations, all purchases and expenses had to be recorded in detail in financial reports so we could carry out an end-of-year audit.
::'''Lanty:''' But most of the researchers didn't care much about following proper procedures for applications or records. The info they submitted was always a mess, mistakes and missing items everywhere...
::'''Lanty:''' The end-of-year audits never managed to completely settle all the accounts. And that meant we had to empty the filing cabinets in search of receipts and order forms... It was chaos.
::'''Lanty:''' But the explosion destroyed all that paperwork. Which means this year I'll be able to relax for once...
::{{DIcon}} But you also said it's not good news?
::'''Lanty:''' Because... Hahaha, I'm now the only accountant able to work!
::'''Lanty:''' Rebuilding the Fontaine Research Institute is going to mean buying lots of materials. How am I meant to cope with all that accounting work on my own...
::'''Lanty:''' Oh, I'll just have to pray the reconstruction work goes slowly. Or that I can find a competent assistant...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Lanty:''' Goodbye. I need to keep working on the financial reports.
