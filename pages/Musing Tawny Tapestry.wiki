|description    = A fine and beautiful carpet with a deep coconut brown coloring. This coloration combines with the undyed fabric's primary colors to create complex geometry.<br />Nowadays, the design of [[Sumeru]] carpet patterns has been developed and improved many times over, and it is no longer just an original simple combination of images. However, complicated patterns are not suited for mechanical production and can add on a lot of production time, so artisans look for a balance between beauty and mass production. "Improving existing machinery to meet production needs" has become a topic of concern among some [[Kshahrewar]] researchers.
