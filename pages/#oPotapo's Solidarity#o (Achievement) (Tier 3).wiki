'''''"Potapo's Solidarity"''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Duelist: Series II]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat the [[Local Legend]] {{Enemy|Biting-Cold Wayob Manifestation|text="Potapo's Solidarity" &mdash; Will of Rivalry and Battle}} after a Protection Spirit uses "Decisive: Binding of Dawn and Dusk's Breaking" without any characters being downed.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Decisive: Binding of Dawn and Dusk's Breaking is only used when the Protection Spirit has healed for 250% of its base HP. Using characters with strong healing capabilities will ensure this attack is used.
* Only one spirit needs to use the aforementioned attack.
* The Wayob will periodically discharge a blast of energy that deals DMG equal to 60% of the active character's max HP (which cannot be bypassed with iframes), so make sure to keep health high at all times to avoid getting killed from it.
