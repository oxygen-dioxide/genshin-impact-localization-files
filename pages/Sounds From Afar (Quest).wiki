{{Quest Description|As the harvest season arrives, the Mondstadt's Adventurers' Guild has received a great number of requests from the citizenry. You and Paimon have also arrived back in the city in response to Katheryne's call for aid...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Katheryne)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Let me just confirm... Yes, all tasks on the checklist are complete. {{Traveler}}, Paimon, we are grateful for your assistance.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Thank goodness you were able to come as soon as we contacted you. Who knows how we would have coped with all these commissions otherwise.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, it was nothin'! The last couple of days have been pretty busy, but it was all super easy stuff like delivering and escorting goods.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When we heard that you were short on people, we thought we were gonna be in for another long and drawn-out adventure.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Being the seasoned adventurers that you are, it's true that you are suited to work of a much higher caliber than your recent assignments. However, this situation is unavoidable in Mondstadt at this time of year.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why's that?
:{{DIcon}} Probably because it's harvest season?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' {{Traveler}}, that's right. This is the ideal season for harvesting crops and fruits, and for the wine capital of Teyvat, it's also the all-important wine-making season.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Farmers are anxious to sell off their fresh produce, and all the major wine merchants are seeking to purchase top-quality ingredients to make new product.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh. Well, no wonder we keep hearing people talking about wine these days.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 fynn 01.ogg}} '''Fynn:''' Huh? What do you mean? Seriously?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 bernhard 01.ogg}} '''Bernhard:''' Yes, I swear, I'm not making this up. The Acting Grand Master wants everyone to gather at headquarters, in the main hall. Hurry! We need to leave right now, or we'll be late!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 fynn 02.ogg}} '''Fynn:''' Hey, wait up!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why do those two Knights look so... flustered?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well hello there, if it isn't {{Traveler}} and Paimon. What a rare pleasure.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaeya, just the person we need! Um, why is everyone running off to the Knights of Favonius headquarters all of a sudden?
:{{DIcon}} And is our help required, too?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, don't worry, this isn't one of those occasions where you need to come to everyone's rescue.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' All that's happened is that the Knights of Favonius have just received a letter from the Grand Master. Acting Grand Master Jean will be convening a meeting in the main hall shortly to go through it.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, well that's a relief. ...Wait, hold on a second. What did you say, again?
:{{DIcon}} The Knights of Favonius received...
:{{DIcon}} "A letter from the Grand Master"!?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius? That's... Isn't that Varka? The leader of that legendary expedition!?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what did Varka say in the letter? How's the expedition going? When are they getting back?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oho, so interested in our Grand Master all of a sudden? Never knew you were such a gossip.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's only normal, isn't it? Bet you'd be curious too if there was someone you'd heard loads about but never met! Even Master Jean says he's a living legend... Pretty hard not to get hyped up after hearing that.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Besides, the expedition has been going on for aaaages, and we've still never heard a single thing about what they're up to.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hahaha, the Acting Grand Master is very gracious in her appraisal.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Varka brought quite a bit of trouble to those around him on the road to becoming a legend. I'll have to tell you about it sometime.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Anyway, since this has piqued your interest, why don't you join me at headquarters, and we'll see what the letter says?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' We do miss our Honorary Knight, after all. It's been quite a long time since your last visit.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure, let's go and see what it's all about. Bye, Katheryne, see ya soon.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 1 katheryne 06.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Alright, take care now.

;(Enter the headquarters of the Knights of Favonius)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hmm, it looks like just about everyone's here.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hey there, cutie, Paimon, I didn't know you two would be coming. So you heard about the letter?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, we ran into Kaeya near the Adventurers' Guild.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... Paimon's never seen so many people in the main hall at once before.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's getting kinda nervous now...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, don't get too carried away, alright? If I know the Grand Master, the fact that he has the time to be writing letters means it's probably nothing serious. It certainly won't be bad news.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Kaeya's exaggerating a little, but otherwise I agree.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' After all, [[Mika]]'s not the kind of person who'd be able to keep it hidden if something were the matter. The truth would be written all over his face.
:{{DIcon}} Mika? Who's that?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Over there, look. The kid standing next to Jean in front of the staircase.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' He used to be a land surveyor in [[Eula]]'s team. He's very talented in what he does and a very reliable person. When the expedition team set out, the Grand Master appointed him to be the core member of the front-line team.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' He's the one that brought back the letter.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Please may I have your attention, everyone. Now that we're all here, let's begin reading out the letter from the Grand Master.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Mika, please go ahead.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Y&mdash;Yes, Master Jean!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Right... *clears throat* Hello, everybody, I am Mika, surveyor of the Reconnaissance Company. Uh, recently, I have been taking part in an assignment with the expedition team. I will now be reading Grand Master Varka's letter aloud for you all.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Ahem. "To the Knights of Favonius: Greetings, everyone. This is Varka."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "The first thing I want to say to you all is: Please put your minds at ease, the expedition is safe and all of its members are accounted for."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 bernhard 01.ogg}} '''Bernhard:''' That's fantastic news!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 fynn 01.ogg}} '''Fynn:''' Phew, my palms are sweating...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 05.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Umm... May I continue?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Go ahead, Mika.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 06.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "Alright, now that your fears are allayed, I trust you'll be ready to listen to the rest of my letter. I'm writing to you from the northernmost reaches of Teyvat by the light of a stove. The expedition forces are stationed here while we restock."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 07.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "I once told you that the purpose of this expedition was related to a dangerous secret from days long past. I am still unable to disclose more than this, but suffice to say that you needn't worry about how our mission is progressing."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 08.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "In the past couple of months, we received an unexpected visitor: the Fatui Harbinger known as '[[Il Capitano|The Captain]].'"
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? "The Captain"?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 09.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "I am fully aware of the Fatui's outrageous actions in Mondstadt in recent history. Nevertheless, The Captain was not hostile towards us on this occasion."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 10.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "Open parenthesis: I rather suspect that's because this time, Snezhnaya and we are in the same boat. Close parenthesis."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 11.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "The man hides everything under the mask he wears, so no one can know his past or his origins. However, one thing is for sure: He is as hard as iron for having the courage to challenge gods as an ordinary mortal."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 12.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "I don't doubt that he could even take out a Ruin Guard by stabbing it in its big, glowing eye with one of Klee's crayons. Open parenthesis: Don't get any ideas. Close parenthesis."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 13.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "Our scouts have confirmed that The Captain received orders to head for [[Natlan]] three days ago. We'll be able to sleep much better now that we don't need to worry about him anymore."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 14.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "I will admit that some of his actions have helped us. But even then, he owed us at least that much."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 15.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "This year's Weinlesefest must be kicking off in Mondstadt any day now? What a great pity that this year, once again, we will be unable to spend the festival together."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 16.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "Everyone here is always thinking back fondly upon the fine wines of Mondstadt, as well as all the happy times we have spent with each and every one of you."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 17.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "I hope that you and all the citizens of Mondstadt enjoy the festival to the fullest. Have a few drinks on our behalf &mdash; the Dawn Winery's limited-edition Weinlesefest seasonal special will do nicely."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 18.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "May Lord Barbatos bless Mondstadt, and may the wind carry our sentiments back to your side. Varka."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 19.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "P.S.: If you're wondering who's tougher between me and The Captain, well, I'm the Grand Master! There are ten captains in the Knights of Favonius but only one Grand Master, ahahahaha." His laugh, not mine.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 20.ogg}} '''Mika:''' The letter ends here. Thank you, everyone, for your attention.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Thank you, Mika.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 21.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Master Jean, um... I just noticed that there's something else written on the back of the last page...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 mika 22.ogg}} '''Mika:''' "P.P.S.: I ran out of paper, so I'll add this here. Lisa, the following is a message for you." ...Oh, this part seems to be from the Grand Master to Miss Lisa.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh? For me?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Ah, seeing that it's a special message... Lisa, we'll discuss this in private.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Everyone, as the Grand Master mentioned in his letter, the Weinlesefest is in just a few days. And how fortunate we are at this time to receive word that all is well with the expedition.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Though they are unable to return to Mondstadt and spend the festival with us, the Weinlesefest will nonetheless be a major event that all of Mondstadt is looking forward to.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I hope that everyone will guard your stations and perform your duties, both for our far-flung colleagues involved in the expedition, and also for the hardworking people of Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' And of course, during your time off, I hope you will be able to rest, relax, and enjoy this long-awaited festival.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 qin 11.ogg}} '''Jean:''' That brings our meeting to a close. Dismissed.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did Paimon hear that right? They ran into the Fatui's "Captain"...? Hmm... who knows what that was about, but it must have been important...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But ehh, Fatui Schmatooey, the real big deal here is the Weinlesefest &mdash; sounds like there'll be loads of free food and drink! Paimon wants to hear more!
:{{DIcon}} Typical Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Vintage Paimon.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hey, cuties. How about we go and chat with Jean? You didn't get a chance to say a proper hello with so many people here.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds good! Alright, let's go.

;(Optional, talk to Mika and Kaeya)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Ah! Uh, h&mdash;hi there, umm... You must be looking for Captain Kaeya...? Please, don't mind me!
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I was looking for you.
:{{DIcon}} I just wanted to say hi.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Huh? Wait, but... wha&mdash;!? Oh geez, Captain Kaeya... Wh&mdash;What should I say?
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, oh, Mika... How have you not changed one bit after being out on the front line this long?
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You were just asking me about the Stormterror incident, weren't you? Well, allow me to introduce you to the legendary Honorary Knight.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! And also the legendary Paimon!
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' H&mdash;Hi there, you guys are so strong, I'm... I'm in awe. Um... I have to go and report in with Captain Eula now, please excuse me!
;(Mika leaves the Knights of Favonius in a hurry...)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, he just left... Well, that's too bad. Paimon was gonna ask him all about the expedition.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' That is a pity, it really is. But don't take it the wrong way. The way he sees it, every pair of eyes in Mondstadt is focused squarely on you.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Give it some time and this'll all sort itself out. Next time you see him, I'm sure you'll get along just fine.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' In fact, let me share a little secret with you: Try talking to him about exploring the wild. You'll win his trust in no time.

;(Optional, talk to Kaeya again)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, what do you think? Glad you tagged along this time?
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' A little birdie told me that you'll be staying in Mondstadt for the Weinlesefest? Hope you enjoy yourselves.

;(Optional, talk to Bernhard and Fynn)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 bernhard 01.ogg}} '''Bernhard:''' Can you believe the expedition party ran into The Captain of the Fatui? Whew... what a relief that nothing came of it.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 fynn 01.ogg}} '''Fynn:''' What's there to be afraid of? The Grand Master is there. One Grand Master should be able to take on at least, like... 10 Captains.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 fynn 02.ogg}} '''Fynn:''' Wait, forget that &mdash; you shouldn't be worrying about the expedition when you've got the Knights of Favonius charity fundraising booth that you're supposed to be organizing. So? How's it coming along?
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 bernhard 02.ogg}} '''Bernhard:''' *sigh* Actually... I still haven't really decided what to sell...

;(Enter the Grand Master's office)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Ah, Lisa. The Grand Master's letter is just on the table.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, it's been a long time. Apologies, I didn't get the chance to talk with you during the meeting just now.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' If you don't have any plans in the immediate future, why not stay in Mondstadt for a while? We'll be celebrating the Weinlesefest very soon.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Don't be deceived &mdash; Jean may appear very composed, but she's been missing you both terribly recently.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' *sigh* Lisa...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe... I'll leave you to catch up. I'm going to read my letter.
:{{DIcon}} I've missed Mondstadt, too.
:{{DIcon}} I've missed everyone as well.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Mondstadt's where our journey began, after all. We have a lot of fond memories here.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 02b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Um, Master Jean &mdash; neither of us really knows anything about this Weinlesefest... Could you tell us more about it?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Yes, of course.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' The Weinlesefest is an ancient Mondstadt festival, just like Ludi Harpastum and Windblume. In addition, it's the most important part of the fall.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Each fall, the west wind blows in Mondstadt. Legend has it that the wonderful scent of Mondstadt's wine-making during the harvest season entices even the Anemo Archon into attendance, being the great wine-lover that he is.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' No matter where he is, he will transform into a soft breeze and return to his homeland.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... Yeah, that sounds like the Anemo Archon, alright...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' For this reason, Mondstadters call the western wind the "returning wind." The Weinlesefest originally began as a celebration to welcome Lord Barbatos on his return.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' In the past, every household would brew fresh wine around this time of year, and keep it sealed at least until Windcoming Day during the following year's Weinlesefest.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 11.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Uncasking the sealed wine is a symbolic way of inviting the Anemo Archon to share a drink. Legend holds that if the Anemo Archon is satisfied with the taste of the wine, he will summon a gentle breeze to richly bless the people.
:{{DIcon}} "Richly bless"? How?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Knowing him, it was probably blessing them with more good wine the next year.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 12.ogg}} '''Jean:''' That's a good question... But there's really no way of knowing.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 13.ogg}} '''Jean:''' These are very old stories. Many of the details have been lost to time.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, that'll happen! Some stories change completely as they get passed down... Hence why these days, [[Ode to Flower and Cloud|Mondstadters will get into endless arguments over what kind of flower a Windblume is]]...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' All part of how cultural heritage is created.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 14.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Indeed. But for the time being, at least, the tradition of paying tribute to the Anemo Archon on Windcoming Day is still alive and well, and the Weinlesefest remains a time for Mondstadters to share the joy of the harvest with one another as they partake of fine wines.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 15.ogg}} '''Jean:''' This is a time of the year when many Mondstadters living away from Mondstadt return to their hometown. For those unable to return, Weinlesefest is the period when they miss their family and friends most keenly.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So that's why the Grand Master wrote: "May the wind carry our sentiments back to your side."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 16.ogg}} '''Jean:''' For this year, we've joined forces with the Church of Favonius and the Adventurers' Guild to host a celebration on the banks of Cider Lake, just outside of Springvale. There will also be a traditional Wine Market during the festival period.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Wine Market"?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 17.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Well, originally it was simply a place where winemakers and farmers would come to trade in raw ingredients for wine-making.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 18.ogg}} '''Jean:''' These days, it is a much grander affair. Not only will you find a range of choice wines, but seasonal fruit beverages and food items for everyone to enjoy, too. A lot of people also sell second-hand goods and handicrafts at the market.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 19.ogg}} '''Jean:''' The Knights of Favonius plan to use this as an opportunity to do some fundraising for needy children and elderly people in the city.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow. Sounds pretty cool.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 20.ogg}} '''Jean:''' If you have the time, I encourage you to take a look around. I hope you'll find it a worthwhile experience. Now, Lisa &mdash; what was the Grand Master's message to you about?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I was just about to bring that up. The Grand Master says he wants me to handle something for him &mdash; something to do with [[Razor]]'s past.
:{{DIcon}} Razor's past?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Razor told us that he was raised by a pack of wolves in Wolvendom.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He never knew his parents. In his own words, the wolf pack is his "lupical," which means family.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Yes, that was as much as I knew as well.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' But in his letter, the Grand Master says that in the cabinet above the third bookshelf to the right of the grandfather clock in Jean's office, there's a wooden box containing some items that Razor's parents left for him. He says... "It's time to give the box to Razor."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does this mean the Grand Master knew Razor's parents?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It would seem so. The Grand Master didn't simply run into Razor one day in Wolvendom and teach him how to use a sword. No, the connection between them goes back much further.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Well c'mon, let's go find Razor! He'll be pretty excited to find out something about his true parents!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, wait.
:{{DIcon}} Lisa. Something's worrying you.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 09.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh, cutie. Nothing escapes your eyes, does it?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 10.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' For the child who never met their biological parents, this kind of conversation is always a difficult one. Even for the most well-adjusted.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 11.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' By contrast, Razor grew up in Wolvendom and has had very limited contact with human society... Who knows whether he's ready for this or not.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 qin 21.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I'm sure the Grand Master will have given due consideration to Razor's circumstances. Perhaps he felt that now would be the most appropriate time.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 12.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hmm, that's a good point. Okay, cuties, can I leave you to break the news to Razor?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 13.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' He thinks of me as his teacher, so he might not open up to me if he gets upset. But you are his trusted friends. I think it makes more sense for him to hear about this from you.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, leave this to us.
:{{DIcon}} We'll talk it out with Razor.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 14.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Thank you, sweetie.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 3 lisa 15.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Try to be as encouraging as you can. Someone his age needs all the love and support they can get.

;(Optional, talk to Lisa)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' As his teacher, I have a duty to give him the best education and guidance that I can. I'll make sure I'm prepared by the time you get back.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Go on now, cuties. I'll leave Razor in your hands.

;(Optional, talk to Jean)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' {{Traveler}}, is there something else you would like to discuss?
:{{DIcon}} About the expedition...
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02a 1.ogg}} '''Jean:''' It was good of Mika to bring the letter back all this way. Knowing that everyone is safe and sound is the best encouragement I could ask for.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02a 2.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Still... I hadn't counted on The Captain making an appearance.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02a 3.ogg}} '''Jean:''' The Grand Master has a rather... unconventional way of describing things, but even then... I've never heard him give such high recognition to anyone before.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02a 4.ogg}} '''Jean:''' {{Traveler}}, if you ever encounter The Captain on your own journey, be on your guard. He is not someone to be underestimated.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' {{Traveler}}, is there something else you would like to discuss?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Mika...
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02b 1.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Mika tells me that rather than rejoining the expedition party, Grand Master told him to return to his post in Eula's Reconnaissance Company after delivering the letter.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02b 2.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Land surveyors are usually situated in the vanguard of an army on the move, and are tasked with exploring previously uncharted territory. It looks like the expedition must have entered into a much less intense phase...
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02b 3.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Have you had the chance to speak with Mika yet? When he's with people he hasn't met before, he tenses up and stands bolt upright...
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02b 4.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I really wish he had a little more self-confidence.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' {{Traveler}}, is there something else you would like to discuss?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the Weinlesefest...
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02c 1.ogg}} '''Jean:''' There is still some preparation to do, but don't worry. Everything's on track.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02c 2.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Actually, while we're on the topic, I have an assignment I'd like to give you, namely:
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02c 3.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Enjoy the festival to the fullest. Any objections?
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' {{Traveler}}, is there something else you would like to discuss?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 qin 02d 1.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Goodbye. I wish you a very pleasant Weinlesefest.
{{Quest Description|update|In the letter, Varka entrusted Lisa to give the belongings left by Razor's biological parents to Razor. But the news from his parents may not be easy for Razor...}}
;(Leave the Knights of Favonius Headquarters)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Razor's usually around Wolvendom, right?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, how do you think he'll react after hearing about this?

;(Approach the first hunting trap in Wolvendom)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look, it's a hunting trap. It looks like the ones that the hunters from Springvale use...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? What is it?
:{{DIcon}} There are traces of Electro energy near the trap.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Electro energy? Hmm, Paimon wonders if it could be Razor. But, Paimon thought he was pretty good at avoiding the hunters...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well anyway, let's follow the traces of Electro and see where they lead.

;(Follow the path of Electro energy)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, there's another trap up ahead! And can you feel that Electro energy, too?

:{{A|vo jnjeq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Electro traces lead deep into Wolvendom. Let's keep going.

:{{A|vo jnjeq001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Raaazooor...! Are you there?

;(Optional, talk to Allan while looking for Razor)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 allan 01.ogg}} '''Allan:''' Oh, hi, Traveler. Back in Mondstadt for the Weinlesefest, huh? Well, watch out for boars if you're out exploring the open country.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, it's Allan, Draff's apprentice! Um, have you seen Razor? You know &mdash; the young guy who lives in Wolvendom?
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 allan 02.ogg}} '''Allan:''' Razor? Wait, who's that again... Oh! You mean the guy who goes hunting with Draff? I haven't actually seen him today.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... Well, there aren't any traces of Electro around here anyway. Let's try somewhere else.

;(Reach the end of the Electro energy path)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 01.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Alright! The last trap has been set. Razor, thanks for coming with me all this way.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 01.ogg}} '''Razor:''' It's okay. My legs are strong. ...Hmm?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 02.ogg}} '''Draff:''' What is it, Razor?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' *sniff* It smells... familiar. Friend, from far away.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Razor!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and it's Draff, too! Are you two hunting together?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 03.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Yes, it's almost harvest season, and the boars are venturing into the towns and wineries looking for food.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 04.ogg}} '''Draff:''' They're trampling crops and destroying the vineyards. Someone could get seriously hurt.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 05.ogg}} '''Draff:''' The Knights of Favonius came to us asking for help keeping the boars a safe distance away from the population.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 03.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I and [[Draff|Uncle Brown Cat]], catch boars, protect everyone.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Razor, this is a big step for you! Paimon remembers you used to hide away from the hunters.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 06.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Hehe, you can say that again! Razor was the star of the show this time. He let the wolves know we'd be coming, so we were able to get through Wolvendom without anyone getting hurt.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 04.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Helping everyone, helping lupical, makes me happy. But... much talking. Very tired now.
:{{DIcon}} Still, it's a sign of progress.
:{{DIcon}} I'm happy for you.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! But, um... Actually, we came here today because we have some really important news...
:{{Black Screen|You tell Razor about Varka's letter...}}
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 05.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 06.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I... don't know.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Razor... Do you mean, you don't want to know about your real parents?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 07.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I want to know, but... don't want to know.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... So you do wanna know, but at the same time, you don't wanna know? Sounds complicated...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 07.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Traveler, come and take a look at the trap I just placed. Let's give Razor some space to process things.
:{{DIcon}} What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Seems like you have something to say.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 08.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Yes, I have some thoughts about all this after seeing how Razor reacted.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 09.ogg}} '''Draff:''' We've been hunting together a lot recently. The kid might not talk much, but still, I feel like I've come to understand him a little over the time we've spent together.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 10.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Here's what I think... He definitely wants to find out about his parents. It's just that his fear of the unknown is overwhelming everything else he's feeling.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 11.ogg}} '''Draff:''' I'm a father myself, so I know a thing or two about kids.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 12.ogg}} '''Draff:''' You know, when [[Diona]] was little, if I got back late from a hunt one night, she'd be watching me like a hawk for days afterwards, as if she was worried that I might abandon her.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you mean Razor's worried that he was abandoned by his own parents...?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 13.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Exactly. I think that's the heart of it. And if it turns out they did, well, I don't think there's anything we could say to console him. That's not my only concern, though...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 14.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Razor is developing at his own pace. There are lots of issues that can't be solved all in one go, but he's making progress, one step at a time.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 15.ogg}} '''Draff:''' But now this thing with his parents is added into the mix... It might push him to want to figure out once and for all where he comes from and where he's going.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like a similar take to Lisa's. Maybe all mature adults think like this, huh?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but then again... Master Jean had a different view. She said it's more about trusting other people and in your own instincts!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... {{Traveler}}, what do you think?
:{{DIcon}} He'll have to face this sooner or later...
:{{DIcon}} I will be there for him as a friend through this...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 16.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Gotcha. Well, knowing that he's got a friend like you to rely on makes me feel much better about this whole thing.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, how about this:
:{{Black Screen|You tell Paimon about how you plan to approach the situation...}}
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, got it! Right, let's head back. We don't wanna keep him waiting.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Razor... So, what are your thoughts?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 08.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Still thinking... My heart, it feels strange... like being stabbed by [[Wolfhook]].
:{{DIcon}} What do you think of Varka?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 09.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Varka? Hmm... Tall, very strong, likes to laugh.
:{{DIcon}} Then... do you trust Varka?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 10.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Yes. Trust.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 11.ogg}} '''Razor:''' ...He's very good to me. Give me a name, teach me to fight. But now... busy with important work... I miss him.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, Razor, Varka used up all the paper writing this letter, but he still made sure he found room on the back to add a note for Lisa. He specifically told her to give you the things that your parents left for you...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That means that he thinks the items have a special meaning for you.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But more importantly than that... Whatever happens, {{Traveler}}, Paimon, Lisa, and all your other friends will always be here for you.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, everything will be fine.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 17.ogg}} '''Draff:''' That's right! And old Uncle Brown Cat's here to support you as well.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 razor 12.ogg}} '''Razor:''' ...Okay. Thank you. I decide... I want to go with you, to see teacher.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 18.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Haha, that's the spirit, kiddo!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 draff 19.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Well, you folks had better be heading off, then. I'm just about finished here, so I'll be heading home very shortly myself. I'd better try and get plenty of father-daughter time in before the Weinlesefest starts, hahaha...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bye, Draff, see you again next time.

;(Go back to the Grand Master's office)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lisa, we've brought Razor.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 01.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Hello, Teacher. I'm here, to see the box.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 01a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 01b.ogg}}--> '''Lisa:''' Ah, my little wolf cub's in a good mood. I'm assuming they've discussed the whole story with you already?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Here, this is it, the wooden box. I haven't touched it, except for taking it out of the cabinet. When you're sure you're ready, you can open it yourself.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Yes, I am sure.
:'''The wooden box:''' *click*
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... This is just a pile of junk. Paimon thought there'd at least be a letter, or something.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh oh, you don't think that... after all this time, Varka might be getting mixed up between different boxes?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 03.ogg}} '''Razor:''' *sniff* There is a scent.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A scent? What kind?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 04.ogg}} '''Razor:''' A scent I remember from a long, long time ago. It's... their scent.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 05.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Human scent... Father and mother's scent.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Incredible... You still remember scents from all the way back in your childhood.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, you really have a good sense of smell, Razor. Guess being wild by nature has its advantages... Let's see what other leads we can find!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, this woolen hand puppet looks kinda wonky. Guess it must be handmade, huh... Is this a part from a [[Ruin Guard]]?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Hey, look, this wine bottle is still half full!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And there's a note stuck on it: "Thousand," uh... "[[Thousand-Wind Wine]]."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh? So it's a bottle of Thousand-Wind Wine?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 06.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Teacher, you know?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Of course. Thousand-Wind Wine was the first kind of wine that Mondstadters ever learned to make, or so they say.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' As to how it got its name, some say it's a reference to the numerous ingredients used to make it, while others say it's because every bottle tastes slightly different.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I remember reading somewhere that there are all sorts of weird and wonderful ways of brewing it, and that it's very difficult to ensure it comes out tasting the same each time.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' This all makes it impractical to commercialize. Wine merchants are much more comfortable working with reliable, consistent-tasting products.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 09.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' That's why you'll almost never see Thousand-Wind Wine in the markets or taverns.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 10.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' In fact, it looks like your parents brewed this bottle themselves.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That must mean there's something pretty important about it... Ooh, Paimon has an idea! Razor, you've got a good nose. Why don't you open it up and take a whiff? Maybe it'll tell you something!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 07.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 08.ogg}} '''Razor:''' ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, he seems really in the zone... and is that a smile?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 11.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Find anything?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 09.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Sweet, cold, a little bitter... I like. Many things, all mixed together.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 10.ogg}} '''Razor:''' But, things in wine, smell different...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even you can't tell what it is, Razor?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 11.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I will try again.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 12.ogg}} '''Razor:''' ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 13.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 12.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's okay, Razor, don't push yourself too hard. What do we do when we try something and it doesn't work?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 14.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Try... another way.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 13.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' That's right. You still remember what I taught you.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 14.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's almost the Weinlesefest. Everyone who knows anything worth knowing about wine will be gathering in Mondstadt. Surely someone will know a thing or two about Thousand-Wind Wine.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, great idea!
:{{DIcon}} (Will Venti be coming...?)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 lisa 15.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Make sure you don't miss the opening ceremony, cutie. Everyone will be there. Razor, you should go too &mdash; it'll be a good opportunity to ask around.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 15.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Okay. Ask many people... I will try.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we'll be right there with you. We can be your go-betweens. You know, like you were with the wolves, for Draff!
:{{DIcon}} Interesting comparison...
:{{DIcon}} We'll be there with you. Just like we promised.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 razor 16.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Okay. Then, I will go back now. I need to tell lupical about human mother and human father.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! See you at the opening ceremony!

;(Talk to Lisa again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' As Razor's teacher, I'm so happy to see him taking this first step.
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' And you must be tired from running around trying to find Razor. Why don't you rest here a while? I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

:{{A|vo jnjeq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, let's sneak outta here. There's someone we gotta find!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 8 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Find? Who?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just some tone-deaf bard. But he's also a know-it-all and loves nothing more than drinking, so he might actually be able to help.

;(Talk to Venti)
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Tone-Deaf Bard!
:{{DIcon}} It's been a while.
:{{DIcon}} So nice to see you again.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, how do you do? Haha, I had a feeling I'd run into you soon, during this most enchanting of festivals.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Spoken like a true poet... Hmm, but reading between the lines here &mdash; if one bottle is tipsy, and two is merry, just how many is "enchanting," exactly?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hahaha, oh, don't say that. This festival has so much more to offer than just drinking.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Anyway, hey, Razor! How have you been?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 01.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Alright. I have... a question.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Razor has something he wants to ask you about. Know anything about Thousand-Wind Wine?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ooh, now there's a name that takes me back. Let me think... how long has it been since I last heard someone mention Thousand-Wind Wine?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Razor's parents left him a box with a half-bottle of wine inside, and there's a label on it that says "Thousand-Wind Wine."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We heard there's a lotta history behind this type of wine, and the brewing methods go way, way back, so we figured you'd be a good person to ask.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' It smells good, but... don't know, what's inside.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I see, I see, so you want to know how Thousand-Wind Wine is made? Well, you came to the right person. I happen to know a little rhyme called... well, as it happens, "Thousand-Wind Wine."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I was going to save it for Windcoming Day, but far be it from me to deny an early serenade to a friend in need. How about it? Shall I recite it for you?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 03.ogg}} '''Razor:''' A song... Not easy to understand, but still want to hear.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Excellent answer. Then, ahem, hear it you shall:
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
::"Fill up the barrels and store them away,<br>Then wait, wait for a windier day.<br>Wax the bottles, seal them tight,<br>For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
::"How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?<br>As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.<br>And what are the fruits that went into the brew?<br>An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
::"A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,<br>Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,<br>Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,<br>As we wait, wait for a windier day."
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehehe, thank you so much for the applause. Was the rhyme of help to you?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 04.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Like wine. A little sweet, but now, head spinning. Don't understand.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, it's not just you! That was supposed to be about wine-making, but it didn't give a single detail about the process!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 12.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, well, maybe it's a little abstract and romanticized, but that's one of the defining features of Mondstadt poetry.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so let's try to pin this down. What did the poem say the ingredients are? Hmmm... Ummm...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An explorer's courage, a love tender and true, a defender's will, and... the thousand winds'... "song of good cheer"...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, Paimon has absolutely no idea what any of these refer to!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, Tone-Deaf Bard, you clearly know what the whole thing means, so could you do us a favor and at least give us a hint?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 13.ogg}} '''Venti:''' You misunderstand me. I'm not trying to make you work for it or anything, but the lyrics are what they are. If there's anything they left out, even I can't fill in the blanks.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 14.ogg}} '''Venti:''' If you want to know the secret behind this sweet scent, you might have to start by rolling up your sleeves...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Rolling up our sleeves...? You mean, we need to go and make this wine for ourselves, and somehow that'll teach us everything we wanna know? ...This better not be a prank!
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 15.ogg}} '''Venti:''' We've known each other for so long, and you still don't trust my intentions? Oh, the pain...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 05.ogg}} '''Razor:''' ...I trust. I... want to try.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 06.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I want to... make wine, and find answers.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 07.ogg}} '''Razor:''' If I know how to make wine, then I know what is in father and mother's wine.
:{{DIcon}} By reliving their actions, maybe we will understand...
:{{DIcon}} ...what kind of people they were.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 08.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Right.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 09.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I want to... know about them.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if you say so, Razor. Guess we'll have to take Tone-Deaf Bard's word on this one. We'll give it a try, and as first-time wine-makers, there's no shame if it turns out bad!

:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 16.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Don't worry, really. Freedom is the key here. It's not as hard as you might think.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 venti 17.ogg}} '''Venti:''' As long as you add ingredients to the mix in a spirit of joy and sincerity, I promise you will reap the rewards you wish for.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 10.ogg}} '''Razor:''' ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 11.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I will tell poem to teacher.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 12.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Then... I need to think alone.
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the spirit. So, how about we meet again in two days? Let's say same place, right here?
:{{A|vo jnjeq001 9 razor 13.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Okay. I will remember. See you, then.

;(Talk to Venti again at the Wine Festival venue, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah, good. I was hoping we might get to chat some more.
:{{DIcon}} Can I hear the poem again?
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02a 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' You need a refresher? Okay, I'll perform the first half again.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02a 2.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
:::"Fill up the barrels and store them away,<br>Then wait, wait for a windier day.<br>Wax the bottles, seal them tight,<br>For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02a 3.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
:::"How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?<br>As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.<br>And what are the fruits that went into the brew?<br>An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02a 4.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
:::"A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,<br>Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,<br>Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,<br>As we wait, wait for a windier day."
:{{DIcon}} What are your thoughts on the Weinlesefest?
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02b 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I am fond of each and every one of Mondstadt's festivals, but if I'm honest, Weinlesefest has an extra-special place in my heart.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02b 2.ogg}} '''Venti:''' You know, the Anemo Archon goes into a slumber after the west wind dies down, leaving the north wind to blow during the winter.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02b 3.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Which means, this festival is the big feast before the winter slumber!
:{{DIcon}} About Razor...
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02c 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I wouldn't worry yourself too much about him.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02c 2.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Staying true to their journey and discovering joy and freedom for themselves is what Mondstadters do best.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02c 3.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The same goes for you. You have to find the thing that makes you happy. Haha, mostly because your happiness is very important to me.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::{{A|vo dialog jnjeq001 venti 02d 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' See you around. Remember, there's no rush. Take your time, and you'll find all the answers that you're looking for.

;(Talk to Lisa or Razor in the Mondstadt Library, optional)
:{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Well, that was an interesting poem.
:{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 razor 01.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Already understand?
:{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe... I am your teacher, after all. It wouldn't be much good if my mind couldn't keep up with my students'.
:{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' But you should understand it however it makes sense to you. My little wolf cub will improve much more quickly that way.
:{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Okay.
