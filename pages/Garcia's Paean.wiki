;(Approach Garcia and Lutong)
:'''Garcia:''' ...This parameter, and this one...
:'''Lutong:''' Mr. Garcia?
:'''Garcia:''' No, no, almost, almost... Wait, no. Ah, fascinating. How fascinating...
:'''Lutong:''' Mr. Garcia.
:'''Garcia:''' Ah, Lutong. My good Lutong, have you helped me order that dish?
:'''Lutong:''' Yes, the Radish Veggie Soup has been ordered, sir.
:'''Garcia:''' Wonderful. How considerate of you, dear Lutong. I'm sure that we shall have our processing formula this time.
:'''Lutong:''' I'm looking forward to it, sir.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? What are they talking about... And what's a processing formula, anyway?
:{{DIcon}} I'm not too sure myself.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, then let's go ask them. Maybe they're researching some kind of new dish... Y'know, one that we can try!
:{{DIcon}} Let's go ask them.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true! Maybe they're researching some kind of new dish... Y'know, one that we can try!

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Garcia and Lutong)
:'''Lutong:''' Sir, I believe it might be worth mentioning that if we take today into account, we have now eaten Radish Veggie Soup for six full days.
:'''Lutong:''' Our dire financial straits notwithstanding, I believe that our gastrointestinal circumstances are not to be ignored...
:'''Garcia:''' And right you are, my dear Lutong. Sharp as ever, if I do say so myself!
:'''Garcia:''' It may be due to these gastrointestinal issues that we have been unable to ascertain the flavor of this dish.
:'''Garcia:''' We require a witness, Lutong! We must find ourselves a third party.
:'''Lutong:''' You flatter me, sir, but I believe that my point was...
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me, but what are you two doing?
:{{DIcon}} If you're wondering about a Radish Veggie Soup "formula"...
:'''Garcia:''' Aha! And here come our witnesses now &mdash; and there's more than one, to be sure! Wonderful!
:'''Paimon:''' E&mdash;Eh? What witnesses?
:{{DIcon}} You mean us?
:'''Garcia:''' Indeed! Pray tell, have you ever had Radish Veggie Soup? Are you familiar with its flavor and how it's made?
:'''Lutong:''' Sir, I believe that we must at least apprise them of the whys and wherefores of this situation...
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, of course we know it well! (Traveler) knows how to make it, too!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, we should really hear what this is all about first...
:'''Lutong:''' Right, yes, allow me to explain this commission. I hope you shall be amenable to it...
:'''Lutong:''' I am Lutong, and this is Garcia, my boss, who hails from Fontaine.
:'''Lutong:''' Mr. Garcia is currently developing a... I believe he calls it the Numbering Machine.
:'''Lutong:''' More specifically, it is a tool that will allow people to perform various calculations. Is that about right, sir?
:'''Garcia:''' As precise as precise can be, my dear Lutong. The Number Machine's functions are just so. A concise answer indeed.
:'''Garcia:''' Yes, conciseness... We must be concise. That transformer is far too complex...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait. But what does this have to do with Radish Veggie Soup?
:'''Lutong:''' Ah. I think this question would be best answered by you, Mr. Garcia.
:'''Garcia:''' But how should we simplify it... Oh! Right, yes. Allow me to explain.
:'''Garcia:''' Hmmm... Let us begin with the most elementary matters. Are you familiar with "formulae"?
:'''Paimon:''' Mm... Not exactly...
:{{DIcon}} I'm not entirely familiar with what you mean either.
:'''Garcia:''' Alright, that's alright. You may consider formulae to be... Um...
:'''Garcia:''' An equation that is used to express the relationship between various quantities, and which possesses a certain general applicability...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? What?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds impressive.
:'''Lutong:''' Simply put, we intend to use the Numbering Machine to attempt to write a recipe formula for Radish Veggie Soup.
:'''Lutong:''' Mr. Garcia believes that as long as we obtain the right formula, we can convert the method of making Radish Veggie Soup into...
:'''Garcia:''' ...A sort of general procedure.
:'''Lutong:''' An idiot-proof procedure, if you will.
:'''Lutong:''' As long as this procedure is followed, anyone can produce delicious Radish Veggie Soup.
:'''Paimon:''' That sounds pretty good... But couldn't you just have asked someone to teach you how to make the dish directly?
:'''Lutong:''' Unfortunately, such a method is too greatly predicated upon natural talent.
:'''Lutong:''' For people like Mr. Garcia and I, who lack any culinary predisposition at all, it is unlikely that we would be able to grasp the essence of any lessons that any chef, no matter how patient, might teach us.
:'''Lutong:''' In fact, I believe that Mr. Yanxiao of this very inn has experienced this first-hand...
:{{DIcon}} So, do you need our help to calculate this "formula"?
::'''Garcia:''' No, certainly not. I would never trouble you excessively in such a way.
:{{DIcon}} So do you need us to teach you to cook?
::'''Garcia:''' Mmm, I wouldn't say that either.
:'''Garcia:''' Precisely, we'd like you to serve as our "neutral third party."
:'''Lutong:''' Simply put, we'll need you to try the Radish Veggie Soup that Mr. Garcia makes according to the formula and give comments.
:'''Paimon:''' Sooo, we're here to be taste-testers for some good grub, then?
:{{DIcon}} That would be putting it a little bit mildly...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, it'll be fine! Anyway, Paimon's never eaten Radish Veggie Soup made according to some "formula" before! Let's just give it a go!
:'''Lutong:''' It's settled, then. In which case, let us adjourn to the kitchen. Mr. Yanxiao has kindly allowed us to use it.
:'''Lutong:''' Mr. Garcia, sir, shall we proceed with the same steps for this experiment as before?
:'''Garcia:''' Hmm? Oh! Right, sorry. I was just a little distracted...
:'''Garcia:''' Too many unruly parameters floating about in my head, you know... But yes, let us go with our previous three-step process.

----
;(Go to the kitchen)
:'''Garcia:''' Let us begin, Lutong, with ten percent less of each ingredient this time... Alright then. Step 1: begin cooking.
:'''Lutong:''' Yes, sir.
:'''Garcia:''' First, the water... Ah! Careful there with the speed at which the water is poured. It is most important.
:'''Garcia:''' Next, we add the ingredients. First, in go the radishes...
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh... Y'know, this looks more like an alchemy experiment than cooking...
:'''Paimon:''' Will dishes made this way really turn out alright?
:'''Garcia:''' And it is done &mdash; Radish Veggie Soup!
:'''Lutong:''' Our process went quite smoothly, sir.
:'''Garcia:''' Indeed, let us give it a try, Traveler. You're welcome to have seconds, if you two so wish!
:'''Paimon:''' Woohoo! Let's dig in!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks...
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... This tastes like...
:'''Lutong:''' ...Sir, I suspect that these radishes must be cooked for a while longer...
:'''Garcia:''' *cough* Agh... How did the Mints turn out like this? I'm sure that I had calculated its optimal cooking time...
:{{DIcon}} Guess I don't have to drink it, then...
:{{DIcon}} I think I'll wait for a while...
:'''Garcia:''' *cough* The flavor of this soup is... actually worse than what was made in our previous attempt!
:'''Lutong:''' I... *cough* fully concur with your position, sir.
:'''Garcia:''' *cough* Alright... Step Two: feedback.
:'''Garcia:''' I say! The formula must be missing one parameter or another, or our calculations are still imprecise... I must adjust the machine's algorithm.
:'''Garcia:''' Lutong, have you recorded all the data from this cooking session?
:'''Lutong:''' They have all been recorded, sir.
:'''Garcia:''' Excellent &mdash; we are one step closer to success, then. In that case, on to Step Three: requesting that a chef demonstrate the cooking process once more.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, why are you all looking at me?
::'''Lutong:''' I fear that you're the only one we can count on to help us make that Radish Veggie Soup, Traveler. Mr. Yanxiao has... Let's just say he's been ignoring us for a while now.
:{{DIcon}} You know that Yanxiao's over there, right?
::'''Lutong:''' I think letting us use his kitchen was as far as he would give ground.
::'''Lutong:''' I fear that you're the only one we can count on to help us make that Radish Veggie Soup, Traveler.

;(Talk to Lutong again)
:'''Lutong:''' We'll leave the matter of making the dish to you, Traveler.

;(Talk to Garcia again &mdash; if the player doesn't already have a Delicious Radish Veggie Soup)
:'''Garcia:''' This parameter... No, no, I need to adjust the algorithm...
:'''Lutong:''' Sir, I believe that we should aim to be thrifty in our expenditures, lest we lack sufficient Mora for our journey to [[Sumeru]].
:'''Garcia:''' Sumeru? Ah, yes, right you are, Lutong. Once we get to Sumeru, I shall surely be able to find some way to refine this Numbering Machine of mine.
:'''Garcia:''' Then, my Numbering Machine shall be able to perform ever grander calculations...
:'''Lutong:''' ...I fully concur with your statement, sir.

;(Talk to Smiley Yanxiao, optional)
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I don't get it. How can people not figure out how to make Radish Veggie Soup...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Also, how am I supposed to know the exact amount of... well, anything I put into dishes when I make them, huh!?
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Don't you just put however much you like and just go with the flow? Seriously, no chef ever sweats over this stuff!
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' If it wasn't for the Mora they forked up, I would've taken my complaints up to the boss a long time ago...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Ugh, it's just my luck, running into people like them...

----
;(Make Delicious Radish Veggie Soup and hand it over)
:'''Garcia:''' You've finished making the dish already? You must be skilled indeed.
:;(Submit Delicious Radish Veggie Soup)

:'''Everyone carries the dishes downstairs...'''

:'''Garcia:''' This flavor is mighty fine indeed, but I must say that it tastes entirely different from the Radish Veggie Soup that Mr. Yanxiao makes.
:'''Garcia:''' Pardon my curiosity, but how... how did you make this dish? What were the exact amounts of ingredients? What seasonings did you use, and how?
:{{DIcon}} H&mdash;Hey! Personal space!
:{{DIcon}} Um, I'd appreciate it if you weren't right in my face.
:'''Garcia:''' Ah, yes... my apologies. Still, I would like to know how you made that dish. In detail, please &mdash; you never know how the inspiration might come.

:'''You explain the manner in which you make Radish Veggie Soup in detail.'''

:'''Garcia:''' I see...
:'''Garcia:''' *sigh* Ah, there truly are too many variables involved in deciding the flavor of a single dish. Much computation is needed to refine our calculations.
:'''Garcia:''' But I will need to improve my Numbering Machine to allow for more computations...
:'''Garcia:''' I can only hope that I can find some inspiration in the [[Akademiya]]'s library.
:{{DIcon}} Why did you want to create such a machine, anyway?
:'''Garcia:''' Hmm. Good question. But before I answer that question, permit me to ask you one first.
:'''Garcia:''' Do you think that the Numbering Machine possesses "thought"?
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean by that?
:{{DIcon}} Does your machine possess... "thought"?
:'''Garcia:''' Exactly. Please think on this question first, if you would.
:'''Garcia:''' We can discuss this question when we next meet.
:'''Garcia:''' As for now, I must organize some data first... Come, Lutong, we begin!
:'''Lutong:''' Yes, sir.
:'''Lutong:''' Ah yes, please take these, good Traveler. Please do not be upset with Mr. Garcia. This is just how he is.
:{{DIcon}} Are you two going to Sumeru?
:'''Lutong:''' Indeed. Mr. Garcia wishes to read up on some resources at the Akademiya, and I have been hired to go with him.
:'''Lutong:''' See you, Traveler. It would be wonderful if we should have the fortune to meet again in Sumeru... and I believe Mr. Garcia would be most glad as well.
