===Holy Sovereign's Notes (I)===
This interactable is found in the secret room in Old Core of Chu'ulel: Chu'ulel Mechanism's Heart.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...The Cuauhtli Scouts that were dispatched have returned. According to our preliminary investigation, there are ruins that extend to a considerable depth beneath the city... completely submerged... If what (...) said is true, deep within the ruins, there should still be...
:&nbsp;
:...If [[Ixquieh]] were still alive, perhaps she could have created something to quickly drain away the water...
:&nbsp;
:...We must find a way to drain the water away. Otherwise, we cannot continue...

===Holy Sovereign's Notes (II)===
This interactable is found in the secret room in Old Core of Chu'ulel: Chu'ulel Mechanism's Heart.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...Laborers were requisitioned from each tribe, one from every ten households, in the name of waterworks construction...
:...Aside from the [[Lianca|First Speaker]] of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]'s refusal to recruit laborers, no other tribes objected...
:...Storming out unauthorized not only constitutes a blatant abuse of power, but demonstrates utter disregard for our oaths of alliance...
:&nbsp;
:...Whatever the cost, the accumulated water must be drained away before winter arrives...
:...According to the supervisor's report, the laborers are highly motivated...
:There have been a few instances of slacking off, but progress has not been affected...
:...Any slacking is a betrayal of [[Grand Alliance|the alliance]] and those found guilty must be...
:...The total number of people in the city exceeds... No potential threat can be ignored. We cannot afford to risk the lives of the tens of thousands he saved...
:&nbsp;
:...If [[Uenuku]] had not left the alliance due to (...), and if the [[Oceanid]]s who once followed him had not gone too, exploring this place would be much easier...
:&nbsp;
:...Human laborers are too inefficient and lacking in strength...
:...It is precisely because of this that they are powerless against the transcendent...
:...And that is why all that is beyond human comprehension must be eradicated...
:&nbsp;
:...The burning sensation that flows beneath my skin still lingers. Blood was let as usual, yet (...) has still not been alleviated...
:...While I am still clear-headed, I must remember to order (...), have him reward hardworking laborers with extra grain rations...

===Holy Sovereign's Notes (III)===
This interactable is found in the secret room in Old Core of Chu'ulel: Chu'ulel Mechanism's Heart.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...Evidently, as mentioned by (...), this statue is a construct from an older era. From its appearance, it seems that the dragon craftsmen never managed to complete its lower half. Perhaps they were interrupted by some kind of unexpected emergency...
:&nbsp;
:...The [[Secret Source Automaton|Secret Source Automata]] have shown no hostility... It may be assumed that there must be at least one control center; otherwise, they would not be able to operate independently...
:&nbsp;
:...With some slight modifications to the [[Phlogiston Engraving]]s, we may be able to...
:&nbsp;
:...According to the supervisor, the laborers' spirits remain high... Apparently, they cheered with great fervor during inspections...
:&nbsp;
:...The report makes mention of superstitious rumors... Clearly a lack of understanding regarding Phlogiston Engravings... Dismiss most of the laborers and keep only a small team... to avoid...

===Holy Sovereign's Notes (V)===
This interactable is found in the secret room in Old Core of Chu'ulel: Chu'ulel Mechanism's Heart.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...[[Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L|She]] called me the fated Sovereign, speaking gently by my bedside of this so-called glory, the glory of vicious beasts. It was... nauseating...
:&nbsp;
:...Her words were exactly the same as those of (...) ...[[Xbalanque]], now he was someone who never appeared in any prophecy. Not even those ignorant, savage beasts foresaw his existence...
:&nbsp;
:...In other words, he was a true "human," a Sovereign who belongs solely to "humanity"...
:...And for that reason, he alone is the one that all should follow... No one but him deserves to be called a "god"...
:&nbsp;
:...
:&nbsp;
:...Without holding anything back, she showed me all there was to know about that ancient empire. That ladder that climbed up to the firmament, those weapons converted from (...), those cannons that could tear (...) to pieces, those (...) that fell from the [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon|three moons]], the research about (...) and wishes...
:...It sent chills down my spine... We must not give them any chance to regain their former glory, or humanity will be powerless to stand against them...
:&nbsp;
:...Efforts to seek reconciliation are futile, unless they submit fully to humanity's chains, for otherwise...
:...The memories she possesses... the energies by which the [[Source Mechanism]]s may be controlled... can still be harnessed by humans...
:&nbsp;
:...Whilst ensuring that she does not perish before her energy has been fully depleted, we must find a way to completely strip her of her authority...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Holy Sovereign's Notes (VI)===
This interactable is found in the secret room in Old Core of Chu'ulel: Chu'ulel Mechanism's Heart.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...We must no longer allow the various tribes to overstep their bounds and claim kingship, as they did before. There is no benefit in having too many rulers; it will lead only to endless internal strife, just as it did with the [[Fontaine|barbarians of the northern sea]] and the [[King Deshret|desert realms]]...
:&nbsp;
:...Let there be but one ruler here, one sovereign, one god. Any dispersal of authority is an opportunity for humanity's enemies. Any possibility of revolt must be eliminated...
:&nbsp;
:...If the history I read from her memories was true and accurate beyond any shadow of doubt, humanity could surely advance, even where those wicked beasts stumbled and fell... So long as we maintain our caution, this power can smash anything that would dare stand in the way of humanity seizing its own destiny...
:&nbsp;
:...Before that, all offerings to (...) must be ceased... This is the sole variable involved. The souls of traitors must not be afforded the chance to entice the living — the dead should stay peacefully dead...
:&nbsp;
:...That way, I shall not put his name to shame... Humans, only humans, those he saved, shall become the rulers of all. They will not bow to [[Night Kingdom|the Night]], nor must they submit to [[Dragon|the Flame]]...

===Holy Sovereign's Notes (VII)===
This interactable is found to the right of the Vision Serpent's Sanctum mural.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...That despicable [[Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L|demonic entity]] has been imprisoned within the statue, and yet it refuses to sing as I will it to. A wicked beast in truth, I suppose, to enact defiance it knows full well to be futile. Clearly, humanity shall only be safe from threat once we have imprisoned every last one of [[Dragon|her kin]], more wretched than she as they are...
:&nbsp;
:...At present, the only problem that needs solving is that only their base, beastly blood can control these ancient machines. And yet they cannot be trusted, and I cannot expend all my energies controlling those mechanisms as the creature within the statue does...
:&nbsp;
:...I must find a way to build a [[Core of Chu'ulel]] that owes allegiance to humanity alone...
:&nbsp;
:...
:&nbsp;
:...Very good. I begin to understand it all...
:&nbsp;
:...Since only the beasts' filthy blood can operate these devices, the only rational choice is to enslave the "draconic" part of myself...
:&nbsp;
:...That way, even should my "human" parts perish, my "draconic" components will remain imprisoned here, a slave eternal beneath "human" boots, ever submitting to their will and ideals, ever heeding the souls of those who that person once saved...
:&nbsp;
:...All things that might oppose humanity must be detained...
:&nbsp;
:...We cannot trust any power mightier than humanity, nor place our hope in their beneficence. No mighty being of such a kind and gentle nature has ever existed save for [[Xbalanque|that person]], one who would never commit appalling evils. I myself am no exception, and that is why we must outlaw all...

===Holy Sovereign's Notes (VIII)===
This interactable is found in a pot of scrolls next to a tent in Core of Chu'ulel: Interior.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...The Recording Officers' reports indicate that [[Abyssal Corrosion|Abyssal corrosion]] remains within the controllable range. It is as our initial estimations showed. No borrowed powers beyond humanity's ken were needed to crush the alliance's foes...
:&nbsp;
:...The casualties will inevitably decrease over time, so long as people gradually adapt...
:&nbsp;
:...They may not yet comprehend why we do this, but they shall one day. One day, they will know that this was the only path amidst the many we could have chosen that could lead them to freedom from all external restraints. To survive by relying on the laws of [[Night Kingdom|Night]] is akin to a traveler in winter setting their clothes alight to keep warm...
:&nbsp;
:...Human fate should be governed by humanity alone, just as [[Xbalanque|he]] once did...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Holy Sovereign's Notes (IX)===
This interactable is found in a pot of scrolls on the lowest level of a building on the northeast side of Core of Chu'ulel: Interior.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...The alliance shall never perish... [[Och-Kan|I]] will not... I cannot let the nation [[Xbalanque|he]] founded... the realm he dreamt of... perish from this world...
:&nbsp;
:...So long as [[Ochkanatlan|this city]] remains permanently sealed, the [[Abyss]] cannot break through the walls...
:&nbsp;
:...No matter how things become outside, here shall the kindling of human "hope" ever remain...
:&nbsp;
:...Flesh and blood may slough away, bone and marrow may rot, and even the soul may plummet into a prison from which there is no return, but "hope" alone must never be forsaken... for this was the sole treasure that person left for me...
