|text      = I recently tossed the dice on a whim, and rolled "growing flowers" off the list.

Now, since having a bit more color around the house couldn't hurt, I picked up a few sprigs from the flower market.

But not long after I potted them, a pile of hard-to-crack cases ended up on my desk. I was tied up for months, I barely even had time to water them more than a few times. I assumed they'd be far too parched to flower, but they turned out to be more resilient than I thought, and stubbornly budded. I guess the old saying "fearlessly the petals vie, the biting cold they deny" was inspired by tenacious little flowers like these.

Premium tea's already brewed, so if you'd like to admire them with me... Better hurry.
