==Full Description==
{{Description|"I had a very, very long dream..."<br /><!--
-->"In it, people were holding hands, dancing in a circle, be they sages or fools, dancers or warriors, puppets or statues of gods..."<br /><!--
-->"That dancing circle embodied everything about the universe. Life has always been the end, while it is wisdom that shall be the means."}}

==Trivia==
* The item descriptions are narrated by [[Lesser Lord Kusanali|Buer]].

===Etymology===
* The English name of the item derives "Nagadus" from {{w|Nāga}}, half-human half-serpent divine (or partially divine) beings in Hindu mythology.
* In the Chinese version, "Nagadus" is instead {{zh|生长|rm=Shēngzhǎng|tl=To grow, Growing,}} "Emerald" is instead {{Zh|碧翡|bìfěi}} which can be understood as "green gemstone," though it is ambiguous whether the title refers to a specific precious stone. The character {{Zh|翡|fěi}} is often used as a bound form in the phrase {{Zh|翡翠|fěicuì|jade, jadeite,}} while emeralds are also often simply referred to as {{Zh|绿宝石|lǜ-bǎoshí|green gemstones}} in Chinese.
