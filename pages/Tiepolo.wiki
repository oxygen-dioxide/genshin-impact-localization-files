{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tiepolo:''' Welcome, young one from afar. I welcome you in the name of the Consilium Sapientium. I am Petrichor's "Doge."
:'''Tiepolo:''' If you trust the wisdom of an elder, then you may ask me anything.
:{{DIcon}} The Consilium Sapientium?
::'''Tiepolo:''' Trust in the wisdom of the elderly is a tradition here. Since ancient times, all affairs in the town have been assessed by a committee of its elders.
::'''Tiepolo:''' And of these elders, the most trustworthy would be selected as "Doge."
::'''Tiepolo:''' And that is me, old and unskilled though I may be.
::'''Tiepolo:''' Though given the role of overseer, I must say that there is little for me to oversee here. We live simple lives and have simple customs. All we do, we do by tradition.
::{{DIcon}} About Petrichor's customs...
:::'''Tiepolo:''' Petrichor is a romantic, idyllic place. People respect custom and are customarily polite and friendly to outside guests.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' Of course, some of us go a little overboard, and as a result may seem almost... wary, perhaps.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' But do forgive us. Petrichor is far from the [[Court of Fontaine]], and people here have hardly ever left the town.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' Just as a stone thrown into an ancient well can stir up ripples, people always fear that outlanders may disturb our peace.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' So please, do not hold it against them!
::{{DIcon}} About Petrichor's history...
:::'''Tiepolo:''' Haha! Well, there's much to tell. Petrichor's got a history longer than the Court of Fontaine, after all &mdash; so long that ten operas wouldn't be enough to get through it all.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' Five hundred years ago, this place was still governed by the de Petrichor family, and their lineage had long ruled here.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' That had been the case ever since the first Duke appointed by [[Egeria]], and they were, one and all, just and benevolent leaders who guided the town to ever-increasing prosperity.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' Alas, the [[Renault de Petrichor|final patrono]] of the family was transferred to be mayor of [[Poisson]] &mdash; there, he lost his life, and there did the family tree wither.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' For a time after, it seemed as though the town would become some abandoned fishing village... At least until after our first Doge [[Ruggiero]] established the Consilium Sapientium and restored our fortunes.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' The townspeople at that time believed that the town fell into ruin because of our relations with the outside world grew too close, destroying our traditions.
:::'''Tiepolo:''' That said, our youngsters believe differently nowadays. That fellow [[Foscari]]'s been advocating that it's time for change, too.
:{{DIcon}} I don't have any questions. Goodbye.
::'''Tiepolo:''' Alright. I do hope you shall enjoy your stay here.
