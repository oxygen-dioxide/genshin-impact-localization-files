===Don't Drink and Bathe===
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "The hot springs are so warm and cozy..."
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "After a good soak in the springs, I feel as light as a dandelion."
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "Which got me thinking... Surely there must be thermal drafts rising from these springs? If I was to float up on them, would they carry me off into the sky?"
:'''Manager's Reply:''' "Attention, dear guests from [[Mondstadt]]: Not only does drinking wine in the hot springs put you at risk of fainting, but if you spill any while bathing, you'll be fined! So whatever you do, don't drink and bathe!"
:'''Manager's Reply:''' "Golden Dusk not only offers an exquisite dining experience, but a wide variety of drinks too &mdash; so please save all wine-tasting for the restaurant!"

===Liyue Advice===
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "According to traditional medical wisdom, hot springs can help stimulate circulation and have a wide range of other outstanding health benefits. Just remember to be mindful of your diet and other factors if you plan to stay in the water for an extended time."
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "When you're spending time in the hot springs, it's important you find a balance by having some cool food and drinks. Otherwise, you might end up overheating yourself, which would defeat the whole purpose..."
:'''Manager's Reply:''' "Dear visitor, we greatly appreciate the recipe and introduction letter you've shared with us! We'll do our best to import the corresponding ingredients from [[Liyue]] to help the local restaurants enhance their menus!"
:'''Manager's Reply:''' "Additionally, your suggestion for us to open a medicinal herb hot spring has been noted for further discussion. Watch this space!"

===Melt Your Worries Away===
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "Um, so basically... I just arrived from [[Fontaine]], and my guide keeps recommending the hot springs here. I'm curious &mdash; what does everyone actually think of them?"
:'''Another Visitor's Message:''' "Praise be to the [[God of Wisdom]], I can't get enough of these hot springs! It feels like I'm melting into the pool..."
:'''Another Visitor's Message:''' "Finally, a place where you don't have to be constantly on the lookout for dangerous [[Fungi]]... If only we could stumble upon hot springs like this while out on recon jobs in the rainforest!"
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "Eh!? M&mdash;Melting? You mean like... dissolving in the water? That sounds... pretty dangerous..."
:'''Another Visitor's Message:''' "Haha... Melting, shmelting, whatever you wanna call it. Honestly though, the moment I'm in there, it's like I've forgotten all my cares, all my worries, all my... responsibilities... Although, when I {{sic|put like}} that, it does sound quite dangerous indeed..."
:'''Another Visitor's Message:''' "Anyway, we're already here, so why worry about all that? Just forget it all and let yourself melt into the hot spring... That's what vacations are all about."
:'''Another Visitor's Message:''' "I found a great outdoor hot spring a few days ago that will LITERALLY melt you away. Fancy checking it out together tomorrow night?"

===Melt Your Worries Away II===
:'''Missing Person Poster:''' "I'm looking for a visitor from Fontaine who was asking about hot springs on the Visitors' Message Board &mdash; the one who mentioned something about 'melting,' or 'dissolving.'"
:'''Missing Person Poster:''' "I originally invited him to join me on a trip to an outdoor hot spring via this message board, but he never responded, and I'm worried he's gone missing. If anyone has any information about what might have happened to him, I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know."
:'''Message From a Local:''' "I've met him &mdash; I served as his guide a couple of days back. It seems like he's already set off back to Fontaine."
:'''Searcher's Response:''' "Huh, gone already? And in such a hurry too... Did he mention... why?"
:'''Message From a Local:''' "I think he might have been startled by something. He left in such a hurry, muttering something about '[[Prophecy of Fontaine|dissolving]]'... Such a shame, especially given how few holidays they get..."

===Temperature Suggestion===
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "Ahhh, there really is nothing like a natural hot spring!"
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "The tingly wingly sensation of a steady stream of bubbles against your body &mdash; it defies description!"
:'''Visitor's Message:''' "It would be ideal if we could put up some more signs showing the exact temperatures of each hot spring, so guests could choose the ones that suit them best..."
:'''Manager's Reply:''' "Dear visitor, many thanks for your valuable suggestion. In line with our usual practice, we will first observe how the [[Koholasaur Whelp|Koholasaur youngsters]] react before deciding if the water temperature is suitable for our foreign visitors."
:'''Manager's Reply:''' "Thanks to your suggestion, we'll make it our aim to ensure that a little Koholasaur is stationed in each hot spring in the future!"
