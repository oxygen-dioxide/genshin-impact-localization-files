'''Abyssal Pylons''' are constructs that the [[Abyss]] can spawn in [[Natlan]]. They serve as "gates" to the [[Night Kingdom]], through which Abyssal creatures can enter the physical world.<ref name="HHS">{{Ref/Quest|Home of the Hot Springs}}</ref> Until a Pylon is destroyed, Abyss enemies will continue to spawn, often including [[Tenebrous Mimiflora]].

Pylons are sometimes spawned by an [[Abyss Tumor]], which is normally impervious to all damage. However, destroying all of a Tumor's spawned Pylons will allow the Tumor to be destroyed when the player is supported by the [[Pyro Archon]].<ref name="NOFA">{{Ref/Quest|No One Fights Alone}}</ref>
