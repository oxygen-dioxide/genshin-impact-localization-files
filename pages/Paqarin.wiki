{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Paqarin for the first time)
:'''Paqarin:''' Hey, you over there! ...That's right, you!
:'''Paqarin:''' You've got such a spring in your step, and the speed you run... It's clear you're pretty strong, like someone who works out.
:'''Paqarin:''' Are you one of our warriors from the Collective of Plenty? Or from another tribe perhaps?
:{{DIcon}} I'm just a passing adventurer.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not from Natlan at all.
:'''Paqarin:''' I see, that's too bad. *sigh* Ah well, I guess having someone show up to help right when you need them most is the kind of luck you only find in dreams.
:{{DIcon}} What's up?
:'''Paqarin:''' Well, I've got a farm here, as I'm sure you've noticed.
:'''Paqarin:''' I've always managed this farm on my own, but I've been a bit down on my luck lately...
:'''Paqarin:''' A few days ago, I got into a wrestling match with a warrior from the tribe and ended up hurting my back. Yeah, I know, it was a pretty stupid thing to do...
:'''Paqarin:''' As a result, not only can't I help{{sic}} [[Dutta|my old pa]] clear new fields, I can't even manage my own farm. To be honest, right now, even just walking hurts.
:'''Paqarin:''' I was just thinking of hiring someone to help out for a few days when you came along.
:'''Paqarin:''' It's a pity you're only passing by. Farm work requires daily effort and care, so if you're only here once in a while, my crops will end up going to waste.
:'''Paqarin:''' But right now, I don't have the strength to travel all the way to the tribe to find someone. *sigh* Aside from the few [[Tatankasaur Whelp|little Tatankasaurs]] I've raised, there's really no one else around to help.
:'''Paqarin:''' Those little troublemakers have been acting up these past few days. All three of them have just been lazing about in the fields, and won't even come back to me.
:'''Paqarin:''' If you would do me a small favor, could you please bring them back? I'm finding it very hard to walk.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, no problem.
:'''Paqarin:''' Thanks, I really appreciate it. They're usually quite well-behaved and often keep me company when I'm working in the fields. I'm not sure what's gotten into them these past few days...
:'''Paqarin:''' If you call out to them, I'm sure... I mean, fairly sure that my three little [[saurian]]s will come back of their own accord.

;(Talk to Paqarin again, optional)
:'''Paqarin:''' Would you mind heading over to the fields to see if you can find my {{color|buzzword|three little saurians}}? Please, bring them back to me.

;(Approach the Tatankasaur in the corn plants)
:'''Paimon:''' Here it is! Look how excited it is, running back and forth like that!
;(Investigate the nearby cornstalk)
:;(A [[Red-Tailed Weasel]] jumps out and scurries away)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, you! Are you planning to steal this food? Shoo! Scram! No gains without pain around here!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, little one, hurry on home to your master.

;(Approach the Tatankasaur in the pumpkin patch)
:'''Paimon:''' Here it is! Look how alert it is, running around in circles... What are you looking at, little one?
;(Investigate the nearby pumpkin)
:;(A Red-Tailed Weasel jumps out and scurries away)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, you! Are you planning to steal this food? Shoo! Scram! No gains without pain around here!

;(Investigate one of the plants without a little Tatankasaurus, optional)
:;(A [[Geo Slime]] pops out)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, where did these monsters come from? Don't let them ruin the crops!

;({{Cx}})<!-- Maybe if you wander too far? -->
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, weren't we supposed to be looking for a little Tatankasaurus?

;({{Cx}})
:'''Paimon:''' Where are you, little one? There's nowhere in this entire field where a baby Tatankasaurus could hide. Where did it go?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... it seems like those scarecrows are the only place a saurian might hide. Let's take a look and see.

;(Approach the Tatankasaur near the scarecrows)
;(Investigate the nearby plant)
:;(A Red-Tailed Weasel jumps out and scurries away)
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, little one, hurry on home to your master.

;(Talk to Paqarin after rounding up all 3 little Tatankasaurs)
:'''Paqarin:''' All three of my little ones are back now. It must be thanks to you.
:'''Paqarin:''' Thank you for your kindness, valiant passerby.
:'''Paqarin:''' My back still hurts, but nevertheless, it feels a lot better having my little saurians around again.
:'''Paqarin:''' I'm not particularly wealthy, but I can still offer you a small reward. Please, take these as a token of my gratitude.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
Available after helping Paqarin round up his little Tatankasaurs.
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Paqarin)
:'''Paqarin:''' ...Ow, my poor back. Why do I do this to myself? I really am an idiot.
:'''Paqarin:''' Kind soul, so good to see you again! Would you like to sit awhile on my farm?
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Paqarin:''' My back hadn't recovered from my last mishap, but for some reason, I decided to test it out against one of the tribe's best warriors. I don't know what I was thinking!
::'''Paqarin:''' How should I put it? This has taught me a valuable lesson: Don't tickle your opponent's armpit when wrestling.
::{{DIcon}} Why would you even do that?
::'''Paqarin:''' I'm not as strong as him. I went there to wrestle, so of course I wanted to win, but he was better than me. I had no choice but to think outside the box.
::'''Paqarin:''' There we were, wrestling away, and I could see he was going to win. I was desperate.
::'''Paqarin:''' Looking back, it's hard to comprehend what I was thinking. Maybe I just thought it would be funny.
::'''Paqarin:''' Anyway, I just gave him a little tickle under the armpit, and in the excitement, he threw me right out of the ring!
::'''Paqarin:''' Ouch... My poor back...
:{{DIcon}} How's the farm?
::'''Paqarin:''' Most of the crops are growing well and I don't need to till the soil at this time of year. I just need to watch out for weasels coming to steal my vegetables.
::'''Paqarin:''' What with my back being the way it is, I can't really exert myself, but luckily, I have my little Tatankasaurs to help out till I'm better.
::'''Paqarin:''' Once the pain stops, I'll go help my old pa open up a new field.
::'''Paqarin:''' *sigh* He's as stubborn as a mule &mdash; he's getting on in years but refuses to accept that. He won't listen to sense.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Paqarin:''' Goodbye, kind soul.

;(Talk to the 3 Baby Tatankasaurs while [[indwelling]] a saurian)
:'''Baby Tatankasaurus:''' I'm hungry, Paqarin... Paqarin, I want something good to eat!
:'''Baby Tatankasaurus:''' Paqarin's in pain... Poor Paqarin, pain is bad... I'll help you chase away those little thieves.
:'''Baby Tatankasaurus:''' Paqarin's silly... Paqarin got thrown out of the ring... Haha, silly.
