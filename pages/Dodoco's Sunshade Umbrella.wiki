As expected, the cats did indeed come in their droves, enjoying the delicious food and the unique shade.<br />Unfortunately, the large gathering of cats also invites strife and the greatly increased density of cat fur in the air, even causing a certain bard's allergies to trigger... As such, Klee's great plans wound up being shelved."
