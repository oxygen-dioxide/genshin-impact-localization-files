==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''
The Primo Geovishap is always encountered in an idle state in one of the four elements; {{Pyro}}, {{Hydro}}, {{Cryo}} or {{Electro}}. This additional element is indicated by the color of the scales on it.
{{Enemy Attacks

|name_1 = Elemental-Infused Stones
|desc_1 = Certain attacks will produce stones that detonate after a few seconds delay, dealing elemental damage of the currently infused element. Although the stones themselves, when created, deal no damage, the explosion(s) that occur do deal damage. Each element has different effects on the stones:
* '''{{Color|Pyro}}:''' Explodes, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}} and leaving a pool of lava in its wake, which deals '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DoT}} to characters in the affected area.
* '''{{Color|Hydro}}:''' Cause seven small eruptions near the stone's original location that each deals '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
* '''{{Color|Cryo}}:''' Generates a ring of ice spikes that start from the center of the stone and propagate (up to 3 times) outward, dealing '''25% ATK''' and '''37.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} within a moderate area.
* '''{{Color|Electro}}:''' Explodes in an X-like pattern, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.

|file_1_3 = Primo Geovishap Infused Stone Cryo
|caption_1_3 = Cryo
|file_1_4 = Primo Geovishap Infused Stone Electro
|caption_1_4 = Electro

|name_2 = Left Claw
|desc_2 = Claws at the player, inserting its left claw into the ground, dealing '''35% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} both on impact and when it pulls its claw out of the ground.
|file_2 = Primo Geovishap Punch

|name_3 = Right Claw
|desc_3 = Claws in front of itself once with its right claw, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.
|file_3 = Primo Geovishap Slash

|name_4 = Whirlwind
|desc_4 = Looks behind itself, then performs a quick spinning attack, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. This attack is heavily prioritized if any players are behind the Primo Geovishap. This attack cannot be avoided using [[Sprinting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]].

|name_5 = Combo Slash
|desc_5 = Attack forward twice, and ends with a slam towards the player. Each attack deals '''40% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', and '''62.5% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

|name_6 = Burrow
|desc_6 = Targets outside Primo Geovishap's melee reach will cause it to submerge underground and dig towards the enemy, creating '''Elemental-Infused Stones''' as it travels. It will also deal '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} to characters on contact as it bores through the ground. Upon reaching its destination, it resurfaces and performs a slam, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}} upon landing.

|name_7 = Scattered Rocks
|desc_7 = Raises up its tail and scatter a number of '''Elemental-Infused Stones''' around the arena.

|name_8 = Elemental Breath
|desc_8 = Unleash a breath of pure elemental power, whilst arcing the attack in a cone-like area in front of itself, rapidly dealing '''40% ATK''', '''20% ATK''', or '''10% ATK''' as AoE DMG of the currently infused element.
|file_8 = Primo Geovishap Elemental Breath Pyro

|file_8_3 = Primo Geovishap Elemental Breath Cryo
|caption_8_3 = Cryo
|file_8_4 = Primo Geovishap Elemental Breath Electro
|caption_8_4 = Electro

|name_9 = Primeval Spring
|desc_9 = Spawns a barrage of '''Elemental-Infused Stones''' around itself. The attack itself deals no damage and can only be used once Primo Geovishap reaches critical health ('''20%''' Max HP).

|name_10 = Primordial Shower
|desc_10 = Unleashes a blast of pure elemental power in a huge [[AoE]] around it, dealing '''100% ATK''' as DMG of the currently infused element. DMG is greatly reduced to '''25% ATK''' when protected by a shield (independent from shield multipliers). This attack cannot be dodged with [[dash]] [[i-frames]].
* If all DMG is absorbed, the attack will rebound and the Primo Geovishap itself will lose HP.
** If the shield's element is {{Geo}} or the Primo Geovishap's currently infused element, it will lose '''15%''' Max HP
** A non-Geo shield not of the corresponding element will only cause it to lose '''5%''' Max HP.
* Once the Primo Geovishap reaches critical health ('''20%''' Max HP), it will cease to perform the Primordial Shower, and instead perform '''Primeval Spring'''.
|strat_10 = The Primo Geovishap will only perform this attack when it is front-facing the opposing character, thus a possible strategy to avoid this attack during shield downtime is to constantly run behind it, and only bait this move once a shield is ready by running in front.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range and angle required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.

==Strategy==
When entering the Primo Geovishap's arena, it will be asleep. The Geovishap is also automatically imbued with one of the four elements - {{Pyro}}, {{Hydro}}, {{Cryo}}, or {{Electro}}, which is marked on its scales and various lines on its body. It will take reduced damage when it detects the player or is attacked first, which is lifted once it finishes its waking animation. Before fighting the boss, it is recommended to bring a character who can generate [[Shields]], although [[Geo]] shielders like [[Noelle]] and [[Zhongli]] are encouraged since Geo shields can absorb all of the Primordial Shower attack variants with ease.

While the Primo Geovishap has four times as much health compared to a Regisvine or Hypostasis, this is mostly obsolete due to its Primoridal Shower attack, which removes large chunks of health when blocked. The Primo Geovishap deals two types of elemental damage &mdash; Geo as its standard attacks, and the other element as its elemental attacks.

The Primo Geovishap has a variety of attacks at its disposal that is used based on the player's distance and position from it. As players will be fighting the boss up close, it will only perform an array of melee attacks, most of which can be taken with a shield or easily dashed.

When the Primo Geovishap performs its Primordial Shower attack, the game will advise the player to quickly generate a shield to block the incoming attack. When the attack connects with the shield, it will rebound a massive amount of damage back onto the Primo Geovishap. Once it falls below 10% health however, it will replace it for the Primeval Spring attack; however, this attack can be ignored since the shots are fired erratically and have very low AoE.

'''Farming Strategy:''' The Primo Geovishap drops ascension stones of its elemental infusion, as well as Geo stones, so if you want a particular ascension stone element, you can wait for the boss's element to be the right one.

*The Boss's element will change at server reset, or when it respawns after being defeated, so you can kill the boss without collecting rewards and repeat until it has the desired infusion.
