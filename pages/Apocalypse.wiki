# Find [[Furina]] in [[Poisson]]
# Talk to Furina

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|The prophecy shall inevitably come to fruition, and the plans are all in place. All that's left... is to judge a god.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Poisson)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This place looks deserted... Guess all the survivors must have evacuated already. All that's left here are signs of devastation...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could Furina really be here? Let's try to find her as soon as possible.

;(Approach Furina)
:<!-- No VO in-game -->'''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, that's Furina, right over there! She really is here all on her own...
:{{DIcon}} Shh!
:{{DIcon}} Stay quiet for now!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Mm-hmm.
:{{Color|menu|Furina's back is to you as she stares at the disaster's aftermath without a word.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Should I just give up? This is all... meaningless...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What was meant to happen did happen after all. Everyone's dead...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Give up, Furina. There's no point in holding out...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sorry...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...But what can I even do, other than to repeat meaningless apologies over and over...
:{{DIcon}} Furina...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah...! Who!? Who's that?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, Furina. It's just us...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahem... Heh... Ahahaha... So it is you, Blond Traveler from another land! Why, I almost thought you were someone from that mob of my ignorant subjects, come to kneel and beg for my forgiveness.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Furina... You were crying just now, weren't you? The tear stains on your face are obvious...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Uh... What do you mean, tear stains? Oh, I remember. The show at the opera house earlier this morning was so moving, I'm still trying to process it.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmph. Who did that uncivilized rabble think they were, disturbing my enjoyment of the arts?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' They even dared to doubt their Archon... I must teach them a lesson. Hehe, I can just imagine their twisted and frustrated faces once they realize that I'm nowhere to be found...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh! And I'm sure Neuvillette and those people from the Marechaussee Phantom are freaking out right next to them, too. Hehehe...
:{{DIcon}} Stop trying to act tough, Furina.
:{{DIcon}} You're actually beyond devastated right now, aren't you?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I... Of course not...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 ciphera 01.ogg}} '''Unknown Voice Shouting:''' Hey, there she is! The Hydro Archon's over there!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 ciphera 02.ogg}} '''Unknown Voice Shouting:''' Quick! After her!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Furina, those people seem to be after you...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Th&mdash;They are? Hah, they're just some rabid fans who want to cut the line because they haven't been able to meet me in person, aren't they?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Tsk, tsk, that's against the rules! I can't let them get their way!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh! Furina just ran off!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quick, we have to catch up with her!
:;(The Traveler and Paimon run after Furina as they get chased by the "fans")
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...This should be the place, right? Hey! Furina!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a good hiding spot over here. Quick, come to Paimon before the rest of them catch up to you!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahh... Wh&mdash;What? What is this place...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hurry! They're almost here!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 2 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Fine, fine, I suppose haste is warranted. Lead the way!
:;(Inside the house)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *panting* Phew... Paimon's exhausted...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *panting* Phew... I'm so tired... I totally thought they had caught me...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, no, I mean, I nearly gave in to the sheer enthusiasm they displayed... Hahaha...
:{{DIcon}} This place is not what I'd call soundproof.
:{{DIcon}} You might want to lower your voice to stay hidden.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah... you're right.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, that's a good girl.
:{{Color|menu|The room suddenly starts to shake...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huuuuuuuuuuuuh!?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What's happening? The ground's shaking... Is it an earthquake?
:{{DIcon}} Another disaster just struck, I suspect.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, a quake of this kind preceded the flooding in Poisson, didn't it?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It can't be... It's happening again...?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, there's no need to worry too much about that! Neuvillette's made some emergency plans, so the evacuation should go a lot smoother this time.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Yeah... I hope you're right.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But the people of Poisson... They've already...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Has Furina finally reached her limit? Now that she's talking about her actual feelings, she's starting to look far less stiff...)
:{{Black Screen|You begin to talk amongst yourselves as Furina slowly calms down...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...It's true. I've been investigating the prophecy for hundreds of years.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I once had informants all over Teyvat, searching for clues and feeding information back to me.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I've tried all kinds of ways, too, to hold back the sea. Anything to keep the coastline from advancing...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But all my efforts proved to be futile in the end. Really, the truth has been clear to me for a very long time...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' We cannot make an enemy of the divine. No matter what we do, the will of the [[Heavenly Principles]] will have its way, and the prophecy shall be fulfilled...
:{{DIcon}} But even then...
:{{DIcon}} You still haven't given up, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Give up? Ahh... I do love the sound of that phrase. It would mean finally coming to terms with fate, but also... for me to finally be free.
:{{DIcon}} But that would also mean that all hope would disappear.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Indeed... I've thought about giving up so many times. Especially after we almost lost Poisson...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Fate is really unreasonable, isn't it? It has no heart, and obeys no rules. The prophecy has only just started to come true, and so many people have already lost their lives...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But just now... It all became clear to me. I still don't have the right to come to terms with fate on behalf of everyone else...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' As long as the final moment hasn't come, it's still not too late...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Don't worry. I... I will keep hope alive for everyone until the very end.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well! That's enough for now. I got the impulse to play the stricken maiden, but honestly, considering my rank and station, that wasn't a good fit at all, hehehe...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Don't take any of what I just said seriously! How could I possibly let Fontaine fall to the whims of trivial prophecy?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, Paimon could've sworn you were actually being honest just now...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (We're running out of time... We can't just go back to square one like this. I have to get more information out of her...)
:{{DIcon}} Furina...
::{{DIcon}} Although I don't know what you might be keeping from everyone...
::{{DIcon}} Your people are more than willing to share your burden with you.
:{{DIcon}} Furina... You might not have to shoulder this burden alone.<!--both choices lead to next part-->
::{{DIcon}} Although I don't know what you might be keeping from everyone...
::{{DIcon}} Your people are more than willing to share your burden with you.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Share my burden...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 23.ogg}} '''Furina:''' That's impossible. It was fated, right from the start, that this would be my duty alone.
:{{DIcon}} But even if your burden doesn't need to be shared...
::{{DIcon}} Just share it with me. I'm what you'd call a "witness."
:{{DIcon}} You can still choose to confide in someone.
::{{DIcon}} Just share it with me. I'm what you'd call a "witness."
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 24.ogg}} '''Furina:''' A witness... Ah, yes. I've heard that you came to Teyvat from beyond the stars, yes? In other words, you never belonged here...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 25.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And if Teyvat is, in its entirety, a show on a stage, then you're just a "spectator," aren't you?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 3 furina 26.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If that's the case...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (There's no time left... Please, Furina, just spit it out!)
;(A cinematic plays)
:{{Cutscene Description|Furina hesitates several times, unable to speak each time, before finally deciding to tell you... something. You wait with bated breath, only for the room's walls to collapse and Furina to find herself in the Opera Epiclese, on the stage.}}
::{{A|vo fdaq304 cs2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I...
:;(The room shakes again)
:;(The walls of the room fall away)
:;(Lyney bows)
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ladies and gentlemen... this concludes my opening performance.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Now, without further ado... we may proceed to the trial of our god.
:{{Color|menu|Furina understands her situation and composes herself...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, so this is what it is. Yes... You deserve praise for the effort you took to raise the dramatic stakes.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Do not forget, however, that I am Focalors, the God of Justice &mdash; the embodiment of justice itself. Does it not strike you as even the least bit absurd to bring the very concept of justice to trial?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' May I interpret these words... as your refusal to stand trial?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In that case, you will have the opportunity to defend your honor through a duel.
:{{Color|menu|Clorinde walks onstage silently, blade in hand. Furina seems suddenly nervous and shocked, but she steadies herself and tries to intimidate her opponent...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You... You would draw your blade against a god?
:{{Color|menu|Clorinde silently takes a stance as her answer.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I see... It seems like you have made up your mind.
:{{Color|menu|The tension is as thick as a wall, but Clorinde is unmovable. Furina raises a hand quietly, as if to use some power, silencing the audience... only for her to raise both hands instead.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can't believe it... She... She just surrendered!?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 audienceo 01.ogg}} '''Surprised Audience Member:''' What the heck is going on? Did I just see an Archon surrender to a human?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 audiencep 01.ogg}} '''Dissatisfied Audience Member:''' Wow, how utterly humiliating...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 audienceq 01.ogg}} '''Puzzled Audience Member:''' Lady Furina, what is the meaning of this?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Shh!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It would seem that there has been a misunderstanding. To be clear, the raising of both hands is not always an indication of surrender...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looking for excuses again, huh?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...I raised my hands just now to indicate my acceptance of the trial. No duel shall be necessary.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I will admit that I've been running away for a long time.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sorry, everyone. I was unable to protect the people of Poisson... It is my duty to stand trial for my crimes.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You are not the only ones to be disappointed in me. I, too, am exceedingly disappointed in myself.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Whew... But now, it is time for the Hydro Archon to show you her courage and resolve!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I, Furina, will use this trial to show the world the true meaning of justice!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (This time... I will protect you.)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Applaud and rejoice! One of the most outrageous and fantastical arcs known to the Opera Epiclese is now unfolding before your eyes!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Mark my words &mdash; this shall be one of the most exhilarating and brilliant shows ever to grace the stage of Fontaine! The trial of the Hydro Archon, Focalors, will now begin!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 audiencer 01.ogg}} '''Excited Audience Member:''' Woohoo!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 audiences 01.ogg}} '''Overexcited Audience Member:''' Oh, now we're making history!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why does it feel like Furina just took over the whole thing... Like c'mon, didn't she just get forced to stand trial for her crimes?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, even though she's still acting super dramatic, she is taking this seriously this time, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, then... Who will be my opponent in this trial?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The court asks the prosecutor to please take the stand.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Your Honor.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Is that so... Very well. Then please speak, witness of Teyvat, my accuser and fated opponent.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (We were so close to getting her to tell us the truth... And it still turned out like this in the end.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It's okay, though. As long as we can defeat Furina in court, we'll still have a chance to figure everything out.)
:;(The Traveler and Furina go to their respective sides)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Also, please allow me to ask, as the final question before the trial begins...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Just how much work did you do to force me onto this stage?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... We did do a lot of prep after the meeting that day...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I can go over the tasks assigned to the Spina di Rosula, since they were rather straightforward and easy.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Navia, the President of the Spina di Rosula...
:[[File:Apocalypse Still 1.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Most of the people who participated in the disturbance this morning were my subordinates.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' They changed into plain clothes, and came to the opera house as regular audience members, waiting for the perfect opportunity to incite insurrection against you.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The people's resentment against their Archon has been building as more and more of the prophecy is fulfilled. A spark was all we needed to turn smoldering anger into a flame.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Moreover, according to our understanding and analysis of you, when something like that occurred, you would likely flee the scene and head to Poisson by yourself.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So, we arranged for a second group to lie in wait there...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So, you mean... The ones who scoured the settlement for me were also from the Spina...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And their goal was to force you to step into the Giant Magic Box, so you may personally participate in the greatest magic performance in all of Fontainian history.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' That's right. That house was a magic box, rather than someone's residence.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' As the "Super Ultimate" version of the setup that I used when I first performed at the Opera Epiclese...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The volume of the box was increased by a whole order of magnitude, and the distance it traversed was the entire gap between Poisson and Erinnyes. Its cargo, of course...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Was an Archon, instead of a human.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' My thanks, Furina. Without your help, we could never have pulled off such an extraordinary performance.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Uh... You're welcome?
:[[File:Apocalypse Still 2.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Of course, this performance was only made possible with "Father"'s support. The House of the Hearth spent a massive amount of labor and Mora to pull this off...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We had to select a location, construct the Giant Magic Box, dig a tunnel, and open up a path through the water... It was a lot of work for all of us.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 23.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So, in other words... the "earthquake" that we felt within the Giant Magic Box was just a normal tremor from the transportation of the whole house?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right. It wasn't a sign of another disaster to come.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry about that.
:{{DIcon}} We deceived you back there.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 24.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmph, then... I can guess Neuvillette and Clorinde's parts.
:[[File:Apocalypse Still 3.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 25.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You gathered a crowd, prepared a stage, and made sure that the Champion Duelist would be immediately ready for a fight...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 26.ogg}} '''Furina:''' All so that as soon as I appeared on the stage, the trial may commence without a hitch. Am I right?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Yes, that is correct.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 27.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, Clorinde, I must commend you for your courage. Only the most outstanding Champion Duelist in all of Fontaine would accept a duel with an Archon without flinching.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Thank you.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 28.ogg}} '''Furina:''' As for you, {{Traveler}}... I suppose your role was to keep me distracted with conversation once you found me in Poisson.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 29.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You'd make sure that I didn't notice anything amiss, before revealing yourself as my prosecutor once we'd arrived onto the stage...
:{{DIcon}} No.
:{{DIcon}} You guessed wrong.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 30.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh?
:{{DIcon}} My mission...
::{{DIcon}} We hoped that you'd share your secret with us...
::{{DIcon}} Before the Magic Box arrived onto the stage.
:{{DIcon}} Was to give you one last chance.
::{{DIcon}} We hoped that you'd share your secret with us...
::{{DIcon}} Before the Magic Box arrived onto the stage.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 31.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hehehe, is that so? Then I suppose I must have missed my final chance...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 32.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 33.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It's fine, it matters not. What's done is done...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 furina 34.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The stage is already set, so there's no reason to disappoint the audience. Let's see this trial through to the very end!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Yeah... The only thing we can do now is to judge the Hydro Archon.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Still, I can't help but be a little bothered by that conversation earlier. What did Furina want to say to me right before we arrived on the stage...?)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 esmond 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq304 4 esmond 01b.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' {{MC|m=Sir|f=Madam}} Prosecutor, please allow me to pass this along...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 esmond 02.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' This is a document that Miss Charlotte applied for and received permission to share with you during the trial. According to her, it should speed up the proceedings.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Charlotte wanted to give us something? Ooh, so she's here too. Hey, Charlotte!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see... Isn't this the "exclusive interview" that she did with us before? So she's already finished it, huh?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, then that means this document is a perfect timeline of everything that's happened ever since we stepped foot in Fontaine...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So in other words... we can refer to this "anthology of evidence" every time we want to use something from our journey as evidence for an argument!
:{{DIcon}} It's a super practical gift.
:{{DIcon}} I never would have thought of using it this way.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's quickly confirm the information in it... Just think of it as a refresher, alright?

;(Begin prosecution)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The prosecution and the defense are both in position. The trial shall now begin.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Come on, Neuvillette. There's no need to repeat all the unimportant legalese.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Just fast forward to the part where the prosecution lays out my offenses. As the defendant, and the lead actress of this performance, I still haven't even been informed of my supposed guilt in all of this.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Of course, it is only natural for humans to struggle to understand the actions of a god. However, you will need more than that to convict me of a crime...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq304 5 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' That is true, but my charge here is unrelated to your conduct as an Archon.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 hero 02.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq304 5 heroine 02.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' Instead, I would like to charge you as a fraud who's never been the Archon in the first place.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 audiencek 01.ogg}} '''Astonished Audience Member:''' Wait... what was that? Lady Furina's a fraud?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 audiencel 01.ogg}} '''Doubtful Audience Member:''' Hey... I came here thinking that we were going to try the Hydro Archon for forsaking her duty, but did I hear that right? She's not our Archon at all?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Charge accepted.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Lady Furina. Do you plead guilty to the charge?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Lady Furina?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I plead not guilty. How can I be guilty?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' There is no way that I, Focalors, otherwise known as Furina de Fontaine, a member of The Seven, and the Regina of All Waters, Kindreds, Peoples and Laws of Fontaine, could be anything other than your true Archon.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 audiencem 01.ogg}} '''Fair-Minded Audience Member:''' Yeah... Even though Lady Furina can be rather eccentric, isn't it going too far to doubt her very identity?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 audiencea 01.ogg}} '''Suspicious Audience Member:''' Yeah, I've never questioned her identity either. Sure, Lady Furina can be super irresponsible, but what grounds does that prosecutor have to make such a huge claim...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I have cause to believe that common sense will prevail in this case. Many of the members of the audience have known me as the Hydro Archon ever since they were born &mdash; there would be no fooling their memory.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' See? Even the Oratrice has decided to show me its favor. Are you sure you want to commit to a charge that will never be upheld?
:;(The Oratrice is slightly tipped towards Furina)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If you wish to drop the case, I can promise you, as the God of Justice, that you will not have to face trial for making a false accusation. We will treat everything that's happened as a dramatic spectacle, and move on with our lives. What do you say to that?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' An argument with near-impossible odds, huh? We have to not only refute Furina's claims, but also overturn the long-held beliefs of the people...
:{{DIcon}} The people only see you as their Archon...
:{{DIcon}} Because that's their long-held belief.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, I tried to give you the chance to surrender. If you must persist, then let me ask: If you believe I'm not the Archon, then what manner of being do you think I am?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 5 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And if I was not the Archon, then how did I manage to live for over five hundred years?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I've got to think carefully... What do we know to be "special" about Furina, exactly?)

;(Select the wrong option, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Paimon doesn't think this clue can be used as compelling evidence to build our case...

;(Select option &mdash; The meeting with The Knave)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' First of all, you may be a member of another long-lived race, which would allow you to naturally possess an extended lifespan. And second of all, even if that wasn't the case, there could be other ways to extend your life...
:{{DIcon}} Such as... a curse.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmph... Who gave you that idea? Was it The Knave? You'd sink so low as to use a Harbinger's words against me?
:{{DIcon}} It doesn't matter who gave us the information.
:{{DIcon}} What matters is the veracity of the claim.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' A curse... I once thought it possible that the aura of an Archon might naturally resemble a type of curse.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But in light of this claim, perhaps what I sensed was not your divinity, but a curse after all?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sensed it too, huh, Neuvillette?
:{{DIcon}} So, Furina...
:{{DIcon}} Instead of an Archon, could you just be a cursed human?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 audienceo 01.ogg}} '''Surprised Audience Member:''' Lady Furina... is actually human?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 audiencen 01.ogg}} '''Contemplative Audience Member:''' Well, it is true that it's extremely difficult to tell humans and gods apart just by looking at them. It's not impossible...
:;(The scales of the Oratrice return to being balanced and the second light illuminates)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, don't start celebrating too early now. Even if I have been carrying a curse like you said, how does that prove that I am merely a human being?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Besides, everyone knows that the main difference between a human and a god is the possession of "authority." Gods can do what humans cannot &mdash; that's why they're worshipped as gods.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' For centuries, manifestations of my authority have served the nation of Fontaine.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 6 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' One need only to turn their eyes towards the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale in this very opera house, or consider the [[Indemnitium]] that is used in every aspect of life.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Wait... That one trial proved the opposite. Furina actually has no control over the Oratrice at all...)

;(Select the wrong option, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Paimon doesn't think this clue can be used as compelling evidence to build our case...

;(Select option &mdash; Childe's conviction)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You tried to reference the Oratrice, but weren't you as confused as all the rest of us when the Oratrice declared Childe to be guilty without any proof? Otherwise, you should have come up with a good explanation for that by now...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Didn't I make myself clear at the time? The decisions of the gods are naturally difficult for humans to comprehend. There is no need to provide an explanation...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Lady Furina, I believe a reminder of your current circumstances is in order.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' While the court is in session, the principles of justice and the law must come before all else. While you are an Archon, you are also first and foremost the defendant in this trial.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You will prove yourself unable to defend against the prosecution's charges if you continue to withhold vital information against the rules of the court.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I never thought... You'd use that kind of rhetoric against me...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That was no trick of rhetoric, Lady Furina. I have merely reiterated the rules of the court, rules that all should respect and follow.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you neither knew why Childe was declared guilty, nor did you understand the structure and operations of the Oratrice...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Instead of having been created by you, the "manifestations of authority" you mentioned have been made by the real Hydro Archon, haven't they?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The real Hydro Archon? Well, now you're really losing me.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It is true that I did not know why the Oratrice gave out a guilty verdict that day.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But the Oratrice handed out that verdict unilaterally, and it has been operating independently ever since it was first created.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You can't... You can't argue that just because a divine creation is flawed, that the god behind it must also be no god at all.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's still throwing out all kinds of excuses... Seems like she's confident that we won't be able to produce proof that she has no power over the Oratrice.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, we can put the Oratrice aside for now...
:{{DIcon}} But then, Miss Furina, could you give us a brief demonstration of your power as an Archon?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' My power as an Archon? There are many ordinary citizens in the audience. How can I just carelessly demonstrate the formidable power of an Archon...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If that poses a concern, I'm prepared to extend my protection to the audience.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Erm... Y&mdash;You don't need to go that far...
:{{DIcon}} A brief demonstration of your power over Hydro should be quite harmless.
:{{DIcon}} Surely an Archon can at least match the capacities of a human with a Vision?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I... Uh...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aren't you the Hydro Archon? Or is it that you can't even wield the power of Hydro, much less the authority of a god?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Indemnitium, yes, it's all because of Indemnitium! All Archons derive their power from the faith of the people, and I've converted the people's faith in justice into Indemnitium.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Thus did I give up all of my divine power to provide everyone with energy for their daily lives. Have you ever seen a more magnanimous god?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 audiencea 01.ogg}} '''Suspicious Audience Member:''' Isn't that... a huge stretch?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 audienceh 01.ogg}} '''Retorting Audience Member:''' Yeah, no matter how generous an Archon can be, how could they give up all of their power? Can a god with no power even still be called a god?
:;(The third light of the Oratrice lights up and the scales tip towards the Traveler)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems like nobody's buying Furina's excuse.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, come now, everyone... Please don't stare at me as if I was a liar...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm still the same Furina you knew, right? The one that you loved? Shouldn't you want to believe in me?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Please... You've got to believe me...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 audiencei 01.ogg}} '''Serious Audience Member:''' If what the prosecutor said is true, she really has committed a grave offense...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 audiencej 01.ogg}} '''Thinking Audience Member:''' Did she deceive all of us, and all of our parents and grandparents too? And all of our ancestors, ever since they were born?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Enough... That's enough...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Tell me, then...! If I'm not the real Hydro Archon, then who is?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If you have no evidence of another Hydro Archon's existence, nor can you find anyone who can back up their claim to be such, then what grounds have you to say that I'm not actually the real deal?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, she came up with yet another argument... Ugh, how can we refute her now? Seems like she really doesn't want to give up.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (If we can't prove that she isn't the Archon, we can try to prove that she is just a human. And if she's only human...)

;(Select the wrong option, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Paimon doesn't think this clue can be used as compelling evidence to build our case...

;(Select &mdash; The truth behind the "serial disappearances of young women" case)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It has been established that all Fontainians can dissolve in water from the Primordial Sea. And that means...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Since you insist on claiming to be a god and not a human, then there's a method that you can use right here and now to eliminate all suspicions of you being the latter.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Miss Navia, please apply to serve as a temporary attorney for the prosecution before addressing the court. Though you act in partnership with the prosecutor, you must still adhere to proper procedure.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Super sorry, Monsieur Chief Justice. I swear this really will be the last time that I'll speak out of turn.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Now, I've brought some seawater from Poisson. As everyone knows, a massive flood struck the area not long ago, taking many lives...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...Including those of some of my closest friends.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So, Miss Furina, would you dare to touch some of this seawater?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If we are to believe that you are indeed the real Hydro Archon, touching this seawater would have no effect on you. All it should do is strengthen your case.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But if you don't dare to touch it, then we would have basically proved the reverse.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, and I must remind you that after the disaster at Poisson, nobody wants to see any more people dissolve.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I do hope you'll act prudently, and choose the simpler path of admitting guilt.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audiencef 01.ogg}} '''Agreeing Audience Member:''' Navia from the Spina di Rosula... The Spina has governed Poisson for many years... I guess her suggestion is valid.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audiencev 01.ogg}} '''Pondering Audience Member:''' If Lady Furina is indeed just a human, she's probably a Fontainian like all the rest of us. Would she really dare to try...?
:{{Color|menu|Furina gazes at the water silently.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Uh... Furina?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Lady Furina, this "test" has been unilaterally proposed by the prosecution. As it falls outside the realm of standard court proceedings, you possess the right to decline participation.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audiencet 01.ogg}} '''Conscientious Audience Member:''' Well, of course he had to tell her that, but refusing to participate is basically the same as a confession of guilt.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audienceu 01.ogg}} '''Worried Audience Member:''' She's just staring at the water without saying a single word... It really does seem like she's quite terrified of it. That could only mean...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (What's going on? Is she really planning to... That's not what we thought she would...)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *inhale*... *exhale*...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Due to the inherent risk of the test, Lady Furina, you may&mdash;
:{{Color|menu|Furina makes up her mind and plunges her hand into the water.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' &mdash;!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Waaaaaah!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hey!
:{{DIcon}} She actually...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *pant*... *pant*... Ahh...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I... I'm fine! Look! Look at me, everyone. My hand is still here. I haven't been dissolved!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Will you believe me now? I really am your Archon. I'm nothing like a normal human, who would fall apart as soon as they touch this water. Really, was this not the most obvious thing in the world?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Miss Sigewinne? If you are present, Miss Sigewinne, please come forward and attend to the defendant.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Sige...winne?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Don't be nervous, it'll take just a few seconds... Hmm, let me see...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Mm-hmm, that should be enough.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please announce the results of your evaluation to the court, Miss Sigewinne.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' As everyone doubtlessly saw, Miss Furina was displaying symptoms of hyperventilation and flushed skin. These indicate that...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' She was experiencing the adverse effects of exposure to Primordial Seawater. The extent to which she was affected is the same as other humans when exposed to Primordial Seawater of a similar concentration.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thank you, Miss Sigewinne. Lady Furina, you may also return to the defendant's stand.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wait. What did she just say? I didn't get dissolved! Shouldn't that be enough to prove my innocence?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, considering your tendency to run from your problems, we did originally prepare a direct sample of the seawater around Poisson.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' However, after extensive discussion, we exchanged it for a sample that is not concentrated enough to dissolve an actual human. After all, on the off chance that something entirely unexpected might occur...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We don't want anyone else to lose their life to the sea.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, so out of regard for Furina's life, you secured a low concentration sample, and asked the head nurse to serve as an expert witness...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a great thing that the direct sample wasn't actually used. Furina could have...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I... I can't believe... You...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (But what's really going on here? Furina can't have not known the consequences of touching that water as a human...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (This is too unlike how she usually acts... Unless... It's actually more important for her to keep up her facade than to save her own life!?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (But... hadn't she given up on everything a long time ago?)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Listen to me, listen to me, everyone... Please don't give me such cold and disdainful looks. What happened just now didn't prove a single thing!
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Think about it. How can you conclusively prove that an Archon can't also be affected by the Primordial Seawater?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Also, also! If I was really just a human, why would I dare to just put my hand in that kind of water!?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Please, everyone, anyone, just listen to me. I swear, I really am your Archon...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audiencew 01.ogg}} '''Exasperated Audience Member:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audiencew 02.ogg}} '''Exasperated Audience Member:''' ...I don't think anything she says at this point will sway anyone. The odds are just too stacked against her now...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With all the things that have been said... Paimon doesn't think there's any way left for Furina to win.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I believe the time for argument and presentation of evidence has come to an end. If there are no objections, we will move on to the final judgment.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:;(The screen flashes red and the audiences' words repeat)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In my capacity as Chief Justice, I shall now render judgment on Furina's misrepresentation of herself as the Archon of Fontaine. As a human who knowingly deceived her fellow citizens, Furina is&mdash;
<!---->
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...Guilty.
:;(Furina sits down and slumps in her chair as a tear flows down her face)
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' We shall now turn to the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale to render the final verdict on the charges.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' According to the judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, Furina is&mdash;
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...Hmm?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What's wrong? What's the Oratrice's verdict?
:{{DIcon}} It can't be...
:{{DIcon}} Did the Oratrice just declare Furina to be innocent?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...No, the Oratrice also displays a guilty verdict.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Isn't that correct, then?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, the exact wording of the verdict is thus. "The Hydro Archon, guilty"...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' "To be punished via the death sentence."
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audiencek 01.ogg}} '''Astonished Audience Member:''' The... The death sentence!?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audiencel 01.ogg}} '''Doubtful Audience Member:''' That's actually one of the available sentences!? I've always thought that it was just a myth...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 audiencex 01.ogg}} '''Emotional Audience Member:''' The one and only time the death sentence has been handed out at the court, and it's been given to the very person we've worshipped as the God of Justice? What an unexpected twist...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Furina's been sentenced to death by the Oratrice!? We just wanted to use the trial to show her the seriousness of things, so she'd tell us the truth... How did things escalate this quickly!?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' This outcome is indeed quite strange. According to Fontaine's current definitions of justice, as well as its recommendations for criminal sentences...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Is this sentence really appropriate for the crimes that have been committed...?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, even [[Vacher]] wasn't sentenced to death by the Oratrice... You know, the real evil mastermind behind the serial disappearances case.
:{{DIcon}} What's more strange is...
:{{DIcon}} Instead of Furina, the Oratrice rendered judgment on "the Hydro Archon."
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Indeed. Not only is Furina's sentence overly excessive, the very point of our trial today was also to prove that Furina has never been the Hydro Archon in the first place.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 8 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But now, the Oratrice seems to have deliberately invoked the title of the "Hydro Archon." What does this mean?

:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Let's hear them.
:{{DIcon}} The first slate reveals that...
:{{DIcon}} Fontainians are not real humans.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Incredible. Lyney, did you hear that?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We're... not real humans?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All Fontainians were originally created by the late previous Hydro Archon, with Oceanids as their basis.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The evidence for that can be found in... How only Fontainians could dissolve in Primordial Seawater, and how all the girls Vacher dissolved were also turned into Oceanids...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and according to Navia, when she was about to get dissolved, she also saw everyone gathered around for a trial, all of them in the shape of Oceanids...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Indeed.
:{{DIcon}} The second slate reveals that...
:{{DIcon}} The crime of the Hydro Archon... was her creation of Fontainians from Oceanids.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, and it follows from the content of the first slate that she probably angered Celestia by creating humans without prior permission.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That could also explain why the Oratrice judged the Hydro Archon to be guilty &mdash; it's to account for that ancient "sin."
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The Hydro Archon's true sin... was creating us?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And yet, after many hundreds of years, the Hydro Archon's creations have turned around to try to judge the Archon within the Opera Epiclese. The twists of history are often the most unexpected of all.
:{{DIcon}} As for the third slate...
:{{DIcon}} I'm still convinced that it should come after the fourth slate.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, isn't the image here just like when Navia fell into the sea?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, wouldn't it be trying to show the image of the Hydro Archon also falling into the sea once the prophecy has been fulfilled in the fourth slate?
:{{DIcon}} The fourth slate...
:{{DIcon}} Depicts the fulfillment of the prophecy as it's already widely known.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In the end, the people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne... Only then will the sins of the people of Fontaine be washed away.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did Paimon get all that right?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You've made some keen deductions. I must say, given how much you still don't know, it is impressive that you've already managed to connect so many pieces of the truth.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However... While you were able to decode all the information on the slates, they had also been etched with an additional layer of hidden information using a different power source.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' When we were at the ruins, I tried to decipher the hidden information recorded in the slates. But since we only had three slates at the time, I was unable to come to a full conclusion.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Now that the slate collection is complete, I shall make another attempt to decipher the narrative recorded within. If everything goes well, we should finally be informed of the unadulterated truth.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Well? Did you get it?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I believe I should share this truth not only with you, but with all the people of Fontaine as well. I will try to briefly summarize it for you...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Your hypotheses regarding the origin of Fontainians and the sin of the Hydro Archon were both correct.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In the Fontaine of old, the previous Hydro Archon sensed the yearning of her Oceanid familiars for life on land.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The Oceanids were enamored with the beauty and romanticism of human beings, and wishing to have those experiences for themselves, expressed to the Hydro Archon their desire to become of a similar kind.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 20.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, even though water as an element is intricately linked with the power of life, the Hydro Archon, as one of The Seven, did not possess the authority to create a new form of human life.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 21.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Not one to give in, she eventually found a way to create permanent humanoid bodies for her familiars by appropriating the power of this planet's Primordial Sea.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 22.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' She poured Primordial Seawater into the Oceanids' blood vessels, creating humanoid mimics in the process.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 23.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But if Fontainians were to ever come into direct contact with Water from the Primordial Sea, the power within their bodies would escape these artificial restraints and return to the Sea. As a result, their forms would collapse, and they would be reverted to their original forms as Oceanids.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 24.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Of course, the Hydro Archon never received permission from the Heavenly Principles to create a new "human" race...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 25.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And thus, the Hydro Archon and all of her creations came to shoulder the original sin of "appropriating the power of the Primordial Sea."
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 26.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...That is the true history of how the people of Fontaine first came into being.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 audiencey 01.ogg}} '''Bewildered Audience Member:''' So you... I... We were all Oceanids before we were turned into human beings?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 audiencez 01.ogg}} '''Out-Of-Control Audience Member:''' That's way too much information for me... I think I'm just going to pretend that I never heard a single thing.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 audienceaa 01.ogg}} '''Dozy Audience Member:''' Wait, but if that's the truth, we can't let the Hydro Archon be sentenced to death! After all, her only sin was creating us...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This really might be too much information for your regular Fontainian... But it does answer a lot of our questions.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 27.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Alas, your hypothesis regarding the third and fourth stone slates was inaccurate. The slates' respective positions are, in fact, correct.
:{{DIcon}} So, they are in the right order?
:{{DIcon}} What is the third slate supposed to represent, then?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 28.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' A key point of the visual on the third slate is how all the individuals depicted in the water are humans, rather than Oceanids.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 29.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' They have not been dissolved, which implies that the water depicted in this slate is not water from the Primordial Sea.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 30.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The nation of Fontaine is the nation of Hydro as well as the nation of trials and justice. Instead of being the literal element, the water in the scene symbolizes judgment and justice.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 31.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You may also recall Navia's experience. When she fell into the sea, her consciousness was surrounded by that of many others, who intended to hold a trial to determine her fate.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 32.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Therefore, the meaning of the third slate is...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 33.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...That the people of Fontaine shall try the Hydro Archon at the court of justice.
:{{DIcon}} ！！！
:{{DIcon}} It can't be...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 34.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Yes, it refers to our present situation.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I think I'm following now. So what you're saying is, even though we decided to put on this trial to avoid fulfilling the prophecy...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In truth, everything we've done has happened exactly as the prophecy foretold... So now it seems we're the ones making sure it comes true...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What should we do?
:{{DIcon}} I don't know...
:{{DIcon}} It... feels like there's no way out of this.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' No matter what, the prophecy will be fulfilled... Is this what it feels like to be a prisoner of fate?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If that's the case... Does that mean the scene in the fourth slate will also be fulfilled soon?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 35.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' {{Traveler}}, I would like to point out another small fallacy in your deductions.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 36.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' About the fourth slate &mdash; you probably thought that the eruption of Primordial Seawater beneath the Fortress of Meropide served as the surest sign that the prophecy was about to come to pass, yes?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 37.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, I believe that rather than being a sure sign, that eruption could in fact only be a small warning of something far worse to come.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 9 neuvillette 38.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As for the root cause of the catastrophe... I believe you've already encountered it once before.
:{{DIcon}} I have?
:{{DIcon}} Wait, could it be...

:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was way too close! How did that thing just burst into the opera house!? Wait. Was that the huge whale you saw in your dream?
:{{DIcon}} That's right.
:{{DIcon}} I'd wager that it's also the one that Childe saw when he was young.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' So, we've met it at last... I understand very well why it has chosen to make an appearance here.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That "whale" does not belong to Teyvat. It is a monster that has traversed the stars, weeping all the while.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It has been greedily consuming the energy from the planet's Primordial Sea, using it to grow. That is the main cause for the rising sea levels...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And once it has finished consuming all of the energy contained within the Sea, its next step will be...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You said that when the Hydro Archon first created Fontainians out of Oceanids, she filled their blood vessels with Primordial Seawater...
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Precisely. That whale finds the "blood" of Fontainians nigh impossible to resist.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Therefore, when it left the Primordial Sea, it decided to make its next stop a packed opera house full of food &mdash; food in the form of Fontainians.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We just barely managed to push it back, right? In that case... Won't it come back to target the people again once it's managed to recover its strength?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That is correct. Indeed, it is more accurate to say that we should thank that Harbinger for buying us some time. Without him, the whale would have likely come onto land far sooner.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' From the way he looked, he must have been fighting the creature for quite a long time.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That battle maniac... We've always known that he had a special connection with that whale, but we definitely didn't expect it to help us out like this.
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, now that we know that this whale is the actual cause of the disaster recorded in the prophecy, all we need to do to stop the prophecy would be to find a way to beat it up, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It is too late...
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean?
:{{A|vo fdaq304 10 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It had already absorbed too much of the Primordial Sea's energy before we could notice it. At this point, it has become practically integrated with the Sea itself.
