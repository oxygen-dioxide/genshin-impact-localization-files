==Trivia==
* The person who wrote [[Someone's Diary]] is Dongdong's father. He used to be a member of the Treasure Hoarders and squandered the inheritance that was left to him, both of which he regrets. His diary likely tells of his adventures to make money for his son before trying to join the Crux Fleet. Considering that Dongdong says his father is a sailor with the Crux Fleet, he may have succeeded.
* Dongdong was mentioned in the event [[Echoing Tales]], from the Conch Retrospection series [[Echoing Tales/Story#III: Unlucky Father|Unlucky Father]]. At some point, his father got stuck in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] while sailing and is captured by [[Hilichurls]]. The conch records his father missing and worrying about him. He was later saved by a mysterious savior.
* Dongdong left a message for his father at the [[Qingce Village Bulletin Board]].
