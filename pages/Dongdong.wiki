::'''Dongdong:''' My dad's a sailor with the Crux Fleet! They travel all around the world and go on adventures every day. He's a proper hero!
::'''Dongdong:''' He doesn't come home much, but he always sends me letters about the coolest, most exciting things that happen on his journeys. Hee-hee!
::'''Dongdong:''' When I'm older, I'm gonna join the Crux Fleet too; then I'll be able to see all that stuff for myself! How cool will that be!?

:::'''Dongdong:''' Thanks! You're one of the few people in the village to encourage me!
:::'''Dongdong:''' All the other villagers say I'll never become a big hero like my dad, because I don't drink any milk...
:::'''Dongdong:''' But who says heroes have to drink milk? That stuff tastes so weird.
:::'''Dongdong:''' Still, it'd be a shame to let it all go to waste... Why don't you take it instead?
:::'''Dongdong:''' Just don't tell anyone, okay!
