{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon receiving quest)
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems Jean wants our help with something. We should go pay a visit to the Knights of Favonius when we have a moment!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wonder what's up this time...

;(Enter Jean's office)
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Jean! We're here!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Ah, Paimon and the Traveler. I've been waiting for you.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, looks like Jean wasn't the only one waiting for us. Klee and Kaeya are here, too...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 01b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, it's Paimon and {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight! It's been so long!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Ah, look who it is.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You've caught me completely off guard this time... But then again, it's always a pleasant surprise when you two show up.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, guess we were so excited to see Jean again that we forgot to knock. Hope we didn't startle anyone...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a sec, you weren't talking about anything that we're not supposed to hear, were you?
:{{DIcon}} Oh, so no one here ordered Good Hunter? Sorry, we must have the wrong address...
::{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 07a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Stop pretending like we're doing food deliveries!
:{{DIcon}} I was just showing Paimon the way &mdash; I'll leave you to it now...
::{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 07b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hah! Showing your guide the way? Yeah, right.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' It's been a while since we last met, but I can see you two haven't changed one bit.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Don't worry. We weren't discussing anything confidential.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' In fact, we were just talking about you...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Maybe we should let the star of the story explain it in their own words?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yeah! Lemme tell it, lemme tell it!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' A few days ago, I was reading Dodoco Tales in the solitary confinement room... when all of a sudden, whoosh! A letter came flying in through the window!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Flying through the window? How does a letter fly?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Like a bird does &mdash; it was flapping its wings. It could even talk!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' It said... Um, well, it was a bunch of stuff I didn't understand...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You couldn't understand? Then it must have been talking about how to avoid solitary confinement...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Ahem, Kaeya...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Just saying... We don't want to let a teachable moment slip by.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' *sigh* Okay, I know... Anyway, the letter said: "Oh Klee, are you behaving? I see you've wound up in the solitary confinement room again..." Hehe, um, sorry about that.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' "Mommy is busy these days and can't take you out to play. But there's good news &mdash; I have a friend who has very kindly invited you to visit her!"
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so the letter's from [[Alice]]!
:{{DIcon}} That sounds great, doesn't it?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' In principle, yes. But the issue is that Alice's friend lives quite far from here.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mm-hmm, the letter says that Mom's friend lives in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The Knights of Favonius could never agree to send Klee off to Sumeru on her own, but Klee is rather intent on taking Alice's friend up on this invitation.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yeah! I really wanna go!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You see? So, we were wondering &mdash; who can we send with her on the journey? Preferably, someone who's a reliable hero, and with a history of saving Mondstadt...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So that's why you wanted to see us.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I do apologize, but Klee gets along with you so well... We couldn't think of a more suitable choice.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure, we can do that, no problem! Right?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 10b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hehe, can you really, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight?
:{{DIcon}} Of course!
:{{DIcon}} It would be my pleasure.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 11a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 11b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yay!!! With {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight around, Klee's not afraid of anything!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 08a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 08b.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' See, I told you that {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'d agree. In that case, we'll leave Klee in the trusty hands of {{Traveler}}...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' And you too, Kaeya... You should join them.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I noticed you quietly completed that backlog of paperwork we had... You deserve the chance to unwind a little.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh, so you noticed? Well then, I suppose I have no reason to refuse.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Things'll go even more smoothly with Kaeya around. Still, Sumeru is pretty far... it's gonna be a long journey.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 12.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Don't worry! Mom's letter had a "Magic Invite" inside!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 13.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mom says we just have to all shout out where we want to go at the same time, and poof! We'll be there in the blink of an eye.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, well that'll definitely make things easier!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 14.ogg}} '''Klee:''' It only works three times though. So we should only use it when we really need to...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Three's plenty. One for the way there, one for the way back, and one extra, just for good measure.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Sounds very mysterious... I still think we should use it sparingly.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 11.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' After all, we don't know the exact location of where we'll be headed, or what dangers we may encounter on the way...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 12.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Here's what I suggest. {{Traveler}}, you're well-connected &mdash; I'm sure you must have friends who are familiar with Sumeru? I say we start by teleporting to one of them.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 13.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' It'll give us a chance to test out the "Magic Invite" and also find ourselves a local guide.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that kinda makes sense... And since it has three uses, there's no point letting one of them go to waste.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 14.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Couldn't have put it better myself, Paimon. So, do you have a particular contact in mind?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Well, we need someone who's familiar with Sumeru and can be our guide, so... Sounds like we need a Forest Ranger.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And everyone knows that the best place to go looking for a Forest Ranger is a little place called...
:{{DIcon}} Gandharva Ville.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the one! Maybe we can get Tighnari to help us!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 15.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Alright. Gandharva Ville it is.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 15a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 15b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Okay! I'm happy wherever we go! Especially with Kaeya and {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 16.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' We should be on our way, then. If you'll excuse us, Acting Grand Master.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Yes, let the wind lead. I wish you a safe journey, and Klee...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 16.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I know, I know... I'll be careful, I promise.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Okay, here goes nothing: Take us to...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gandharva Ville!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 kaeya 17.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Gandharva Ville.
:{{DIcon}} Gandharva Ville.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 klee 17.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Grand Arbor Hill!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 1 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? No, it's not a hill! Ah, wait!!!
:;(The seal on the Magic Invite disappears and the envelope opens. The group teleports)
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, we made it. Paimon was sure we were about to end up some place super weird.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hehe, sorry! It was an accident...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's okay, Klee. Good news is, this Magic Invite really does work!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Fascinating. One moment we're in Mondstadt, the next we're in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' So this is where Mom's friend lives? Wow, there are so many big flowers! Oh, and jumpy mushrooms!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You ain't seen nothin' yet! Sumeru's full of strange stuff like this!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like, um...
:{{DIcon}} Boars with mushrooms growing on them.
::{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah! Heh, Paimon was pretty creeped-out the first time we saw one of those!
:{{DIcon}} Little flying silver fairies.
::{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon doesn't remember seeing one of those... Wait, are you talking about Paimon!?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Listen carefully, Klee. Those jumping mushrooms are called Fungi. They may look cute, but if you get too close to one, it'll try to hit you with its cap.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Really? Okay, well... I'll hit it back with my cap!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' And then I'll hit it with the hood on my jacket, too! Hee-hee, I'll definitely win if it's two hats against one!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah Klee, you show 'em!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As long as playing with hats doesn't escalate to playing with bombs... But Klee's our friend, so we should be able to convince her to keep this trip explosion-free, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mm-hmm! I'll be extra careful not to blow anything up! Um... I mean, I'll try my best...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, that's very good of you, Klee! You're being very grown-up today!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yep! I'm super grown-up, I'm already the Spark Knight!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, Spark Knight! Well, keep up the good work, 'cause very soon we'll be introducing you to a friend of ours called Tighnari in Gandharva Ville!

{{Quest Description|update|It's important to find a guide when traveling. That way, the journey should be much smoother... right?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the center of Gandharva Ville)<!--no ASTK-->
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! It's Collei! Huh, and is that Eula with her? What's she doing in Gandharva Ville?

;(Approach Collei and Eula)
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm, I've definitely heard the other Forest Rangers mention somebody dressed like that before...
:{{Introductory Note|Collei}}
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I see. Then it looks like my suspicions are correct... Hmm? Who do we have here?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Oh, Kaeya and Klee are here, too!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hi Collei, it's been aaages!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Collei, Eula! What are you two doing here?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that question's really more for Eula.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' What a coincidence. I didn't expect to run into a fellow Favonian captain this far from Mondstadt. How's the vacation going?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...Seriously? Bring the whole crew, why don't you? Tsk...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or does Eula not look particularly thrilled right now...
:{{DIcon}} Well since we're all here...
:{{DIcon}} ...Who's up for some afternoon tea?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, cool! Great idea! Let's go.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If you're trying to accommodate me, there must be some misunderstanding. I'm fine. There's nothing embarrassing about running into colleagues in the wild.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Uh, but earlier you were...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Great! Well, I'm sure there's a fascinating reason behind why you're all the way out here in Sumeru. Do share it with us.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Kaeya sure looks like he's getting a kick out of this...)
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If you must know, it's a little complicated... But simply put, I'm searching for a cousin of mine from the [[Lawrence Clan]].
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' He went missing recently, and after searching his home, we found evidence that led us here. He appears to believe that somewhere in Sumeru lies the key to restoring our clan to its former glory.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He came all the way to Sumeru for that? What was he going to do, enroll at the Akademiya?
:{{DIcon}} That would be quite a roundabout way to achieve his goals.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I doubt he came here to learn. He's much too old to start getting a basic education now, and from what I know of him, I doubt he has any interest in intellectual pursuits.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' All he cares about is restoring his clan's honor. Nothing wrong with that idea in principle, but I'm not certain how fanatical he is about it. So there's no knowing what lengths he might go to.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' As a knight and a member of the Lawrence Clan, it's my duty to make sure he doesn't bring harm to others.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oho... If this is true, then your cousin is quite a man of action. Traveling alone to Sumeru from Mondstadt is no mean feat.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Nor is daring to make me personally concerned about his safety. Hmph, he has no idea what's coming to him.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, underneath it all, Paimon thinks Eula's a really caring person.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yeah, she's the best! She brought me some [[Moon Pie]] last time!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ahem! He is family, after all... Anyway, I will make sure to find him and escort him safely back to Mondstadt.
:{{DIcon}} You're really going the extra mile for him.
:{{DIcon}} He'll owe you one after this.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hm. Now, back to you... How and why did you all suddenly show up here?
:{{Black Screen|You explain the situation to Eula and Collei...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm, I'm afraid that could be tricky... Master Tighnari is still at Pardis Dhyai delivering his lectures. He isn't due back for a while...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' But I think I'll be able to help out. The description in the invitation letter is vague, but I'm pretty sure it's hinting at somewhere in the desert...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' The desert?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Eh? Does that mean Mom's friend is from the desert? Hmm... I guess I'll call her Aunty Desert for now...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I remember Mahamatra Cyno once told me a strange rumor about that part of the desert...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' They say there's a secret domain there that can make all of your wishes come true...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah, wait wait... He said I should just call him "Cyno." I keep forgetting that...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 13.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Huh. A domain that makes people's wishes come true...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, so is it true? Does it really exist?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I probably would have believed it a few years ago. But now that I'm a little older and wiser, I think it makes sense to be more skeptical about things like this.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 14.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This explains a lot... The domain could well be a myth, but he probably figured he had nothing to lose. If you intend to search for this place, then please allow me to join you.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 eula 15.ogg}} '''Eula:''' My cousin has quite a collection of books about Sumeru desert mythology on his shelves. I highly suspect that he, too, is looking for that domain.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Can I come, too? I&mdash;I think you might need me there!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' You'll definitely need a local guide while you're in Sumeru, and... I think I have what it takes to be that person! Plus, it's a Forest Ranger's duty to bravely lend a helping hand to others in need.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' We have every confidence in your abilities, Collei. Our party grows bigger and stronger still... What say you to this, Captain Klee?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 10.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I think it's suuuuper cool!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 11.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I read in a story book that "On your own you only have a drop of happiness, but in a group you have a whole ocean."
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 klee 12.ogg}} '''Klee:''' So I'm sure Mom's friend will be super happy if I show up to visit and bring a whole bunch of friends with me!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the spirit! In that case, let's get the Magic Invite to take us there!
:{{Black Screen|Klee takes out the Magic Invite, and everyone says the destination out loud...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Whoa, this desert is huuuge!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Wow, what an incredible sight...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Yes, the scenery is quite magnificent.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Are you okay, Eula? You don't look so good...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I'm fine, just taking a moment to acclimatize... The air here is much drier than in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmm, this area doesn't look very habitable, and... I don't see a domain entrance nearby, either.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh no... I&mdash;I didn't pronounce the destination wrong, did I? I mean, I don't THINK I did...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Nope, you got it right! It definitely wasn't your fault!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I said "Gandharva Ville" wrong earlier, but we still ended up in the right place!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Klee's right. We're in the right place, there's no doubt about that.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Phew...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, maybe the entrance is hidden under a sand dune?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...Who knows. We'll just have to start by looking around.
:{{Black Screen|The party splits up to search the area, but turns up empty-handed...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's sooo tired... and so thirsty...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hmm. We should have found something by now. Unless there's a problem with the Magic Invite?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Huh? How could that happen?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Uh-oh, did I break it by accident? But I didn't do anything! Dodoco will back me up, I'm innocent!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It's definitely not your fault, Klee! See? Not even a wrinkle on it.
:{{DIcon}} If the domain is somewhere nearby...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 06b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hmm? Does {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight have an idea?
:{{DIcon}} Instead of us trying to find the domain...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon knows where you're going with this!
:{{DIcon}} Yes. We can try getting the domain to find us.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Interesting approach. Assuming we're right about this Magic Invite...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' That is to say, if it was sent from within the domain, the invite likely has some sort of connection to it.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, I get it now! Plus, I know a super special trick we can use!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' What kind of trick? Can you teach it to us too?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Of course! Mom said that if I ever need help, I just need to shout this out loud:
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Magic Invite, Magic Invite, Klee needs your aid! Do something now, so Klee's not afraid!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, {{Traveler}}! Something flew over!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmm? It looks like... a bottle?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Remarkably effective... That's one trick I'll be keeping up my sleeve in the future. You should make a note of it too, Eula.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Absolutely not! It's not my style.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I suppose bottles are pretty common in Sumeru mythology... So, is this supposed to be the entrance to the domain?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A domain in a bottle, huh... Well, if there's one thing we learned in Liyue, it's never judge a domain by its cover.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess there's one way to find out if this is really the way in! Come on, reach out with your hand!
:{{DIcon}} (Touch the bottle...)
:;(The group is teleported to the [[Veluriyam Mirage]])

;(After teleporting)
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We made it! That answers that question...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' There's a path. I'm gonna take a look!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hey, don't run off and leave us all behind.

;(Approach Klee)
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Look, look! There's a huge garden here!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Incredible... It looked so small from the outside...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Everyone, I suggest that we stop here for a moment. We should take stock of our surroundings before deciding on our next course of action.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Since we're in a bottle... Has anyone here heard the story of the "magic bottle"?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, you mean the one about King Deshret and the Jinni-in-a-bottle? I've read it before, but I struggled with some of the vocabulary...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' What's the story about, Kaeya?
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mom told me a story once about a group of adventurers who went to Bottleland... But I don't think there was a magic bottle in that one...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Don't worry, Klee, I can tell you all about the story of the magic bottle. But if you keep running off on your own, you'll miss all the good parts...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh... Okay, I got it. I'll stay with the group from now on...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You sense it too, don't you Collei? Something's not quite right.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yeah... The scenery here is beautiful, but it's too quiet. And there's no sign of Klee's "Aunty Desert" here anywhere...
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Maybe Aunty Desert lives way further down inside? This place is suuuuper big, just like Fischl's Immernachtreich. We still have a long way to go!
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess we won't know until we get there. Let's keep going.
:{{A|vo yqeq201 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hopefully we'll meet her soon!
