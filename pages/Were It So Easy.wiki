{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Cosanzeana)
:'''Cosanzeana:''' Ah, it's {{Traveler}} and Paimon, the bringers of exotic flowers!
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, Cosanzeana. Have the flowers we brought been growing well?
:'''Cosanzeana:''' Um, about that... I haven't gone to look at them for a whole day...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Didn't you like the flowers? Why aren't you looking after them?
:'''Cosanzeana:''' Ohh... They were so hard to get, so I do want to take good care of them, so, so much... But when I think that they might wither before my eyes, I... I'm scared to go...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh wow, you really are very concerned about them... Why don't we go have a look together? If anything bad happens, we'll help you out!
:{{DIcon}} There's no point in worrying too much.
:'''Cosanzeana:''' You're right... Let's go together! With the two of you to help me, I feel like we can handle this!

;(Approach the garden)
:'''Paimon:''' There's the garden... Eh!? Why's there a Breacher Primus wrecking it!?
:'''Cosanzeana:''' Huh? Hey, you baddie! Shoo, shoo! Get away from my flowers!

;(After defeating the Breacher Primus)
:'''Cosanzeana:''' *sob* My precious flowers... They've been ruined...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, what a pity... So the reason your flowers couldn't grow is because of the damage done by the Breacher Primus?
:'''Cosanzeana:''' ...I&nbsp;... I'm going to keep watch next to my flowers from now on! I'm never leaving again!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, calm down for a second, Cosanzeana. Let's think of another solution together. First off, why would the Breacher Primus damage your flower garden?
:{{DIcon}} When you brought other flowers back before...
:{{DIcon}} Did any Breacher Primuses come after you?
:'''Cosanzeana:''' No, never! Hmph, that bad guy would only dare do such things behind my back. Ooh, now I'm really mad!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, uh, Paimon didn't expect Cosanzeana could also get so angry. Guess she really does care a lot about these flowers.
:'''Paimon:''' But thinking back for a moment, it's not like the Primuses ran away once she got close...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps it's not the flowers that are attracting them.
:'''Paimon:''' That's possible. Let's check the area around the garden and see what we can find!

;(Talk to Cosanzeana, optional)
:'''Cosanzeana:''' My garden... Why did that bad guy want to destroy my garden...

;(Investigate the tall grass, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Nothing special...

;(Investigate the rock pile, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Doesn't seem like there's anything here...

;(Investigate the gear)
:'''Paimon:''' What's buried over here... Whoa! Look out!

;(While fighting the Gardemek)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! You hunk-of-junk punk! Get ready to be disassembled!

;(After defeating the Gardemek)
:'''Cosanzeana:''' Awesome, {{Traveler}}! You turned that ugly machine into beautiful components &mdash; "kabam," just like that!
:{{DIcon}} Well, it won't be troubling this garden again.
:'''Paimon:''' Some of the flowers have been damaged, but the rest still look like they're in good shape. There shouldn't be any Breacher Primuses coming around to trouble your garden again, so your flowers can now grow strong and healthy!
:'''Cosanzeana:''' This is great... Still, I've learned my lesson. Such precious flowers require attentive care and diligent protection.
:'''Cosanzeana:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon... You've brought me such exotic flowers, and you've even helped me defend my garden. How can I ever repay you...
:'''Paimon:''' Aw, no need to be so polite about it!
:'''Cosanzeana:''' Ah, yes, I know! I picked these flowers myself &mdash; they're very precious to me! Can I give them to you?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh! Um, if these flowers really are that precious, then you should probably start your own garden to plant them in, {{Traveler}}...
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, uh, aren't these Tidalga? Do they really count as flowers?
:'''Cosanzeana:''' Tidalga are plants, and they are very beautiful, so of course they're flowers. This is what humans call "biology" &mdash; I've spent some time studying it so that I can become a great florist in the future. Hehe.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon feels like there's something kinda off about this, but it's not like Paimon knows too much about plant taxonomy either...
:'''Cosanzeana:''' I'll continue to work hard towards my goal. I've heard humans say that excellent florists are able to breed new types of flowers, which they then bring to "horticultural fairs."
:'''Cosanzeana:''' I want to do that, too &mdash; and I want to win "awards" there!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's very commendable and everything, but Paimon feels like there are still some misunderstandings here that will be hard to explain...
:'''Paimon:''' Her purpose for taking part in a horticultural fair is to show off the new varieties of plants she's made and let humans appreciate them, right?
:'''Paimon:''' The thing is, her senses and aesthetics might be a bit too different from those of humans... Do you think they might find the flowers she breeds... weird?
:{{DIcon}} You're rather invested in her horticultural career, I see.
:'''Paimon:''' Of course! Paimon's her teacher, you know. If she wins, Paimon'll look good too!
:{{DIcon}} There's no need to be too obsessed with winning awards. The most important thing is to be happy with your work.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true. The only person who needs to find the flowers you raise beautiful is you! You don't have to worry too much about what other people think.
::'''Paimon:''' You just need to take care of your garden, watch the lovely flowers, and be happy every day!
::'''Cosanzeana:''' Yes! I'll make sure they grow up healthy and strong!
:{{DIcon}} You've taken your first step toward success.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true. The varieties you come up with will probably be pretty unique, but some people will like that kinda thing!
::'''Paimon:''' Once you finish breeding a new variety, make sure you tell us first, alright?
::'''Cosanzeana:''' Of course! You've helped me so much, after all!
<!--Misplaced line?
:'''Cosanzeana:''' Ah, my flowers from a distant land~ May you grow quickly, tall may you stand~
