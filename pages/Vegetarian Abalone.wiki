|description     = A vegetarian dish with a rich flavor.
|desc_suspicious = The overly thick sauce has totally covered the freshness that the ingredients should have had, and the condiment leaves your mouth dry no matter how much you wash it down with water.
|desc_basic      = The matsutake has been sliced thin and fried till golden before pouring the sauce. The matsutake meat is sumptuous and has flavor to match that of fresh abalone &mdash; almost enough to make you think it was the real thing.
|desc_delicious  = With the aid of the sauce, the matsutake has achieved an excellent, elegant mouth-feel that so rivals scallop in tenderness and abalone in freshness that you can hardly tell them apart. If you left your customer guessing before revealing the truth later, you would be sure to earn their astonished praise.

==Trivia==
* To celebrate Hu Tao's birthday, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] released a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/16399 real-life recipe] for [[Ghostly March]] and Vegetarian Abalone.
* Although the in-game dish uses {{w|matsutake}}, a luxury mushroom in Japanese cuisine, this Liyue (Chinese) dish is likely made of the {{w|Pleurotus eryngii|king oyster mushroom}} (''Pleurotus eryngii''), which is called the {{Lang|"apricot abalone mushroom"|zh=杏鲍菇|zh_rm=xìngbàogū}} in Chinese. In fact, the official recipe by miHoYo uses this ingredient.
* In Japan, mushroom-based mock abalone is usually made from {{w|shiitake}}, not matsutake.
