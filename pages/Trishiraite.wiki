==Description==
{{Description|A splendorous stone that can be found in the depths of desolate mountains, seemingly formed from congealed elemental energy.<br>According to old Sumeru legends, there once was an underground kingdom named [[Dahri]] that fell to the [[cataclysm|dark disaster]] upon straying from the true path. During the sun-swallowing battles of that bygone age, even the hardest of stones were set aflame. As the flames of war died out, all that remained from the calamity were these deep-red ores. If one should listen closely, one may yet hear the echoing sounds from that battle still ringing forth.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
