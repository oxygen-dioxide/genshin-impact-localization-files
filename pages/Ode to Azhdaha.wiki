|-
|{{Lang|mini=1|zh=金阙连望舒}} || ''Jīnquē lián Wàngshū,'' || The imperial palace even reached Wangshu<ref group="Note">Wangshu can refer to [[Wangshu Inn]]. It is also an archaic term for the moon. So as a hyperbole, the line can also be interpreted to mean that Azhdaha's domain even reached the moon (basically Azhdaha's domain was very large).</ref>

==Developer Insight==
{{See also|Azhdaha/Design}}
'''Manny Calavera, Creative Concept and Writing Team:''' The BGM of the Azhdaha boss fight is the first Genshin Impact soundtrack with Chinese lyrics. The lyrics creation of the song also follows the same concept as Azhdaha's appearance, encompassing both familiarity and detachment. What we mean by familiarity is that players will not only know that the lyrics are in Chinese the second they hear it but they will also feel the ancient and mythical elements of the song. As for the detached aspect, the song has an ancient, regional style that is strong and unique. The verses talk about things that aren't relatable or easy to understand. The combination of the two is a representation of the relationship between Azhdaha and Zhongli. We referenced {{w|Chu Ci|Chu Chi (Verses of Chu)}} when writing the song's lyrics. We wanted to emphasize the vibe and emotions of the song using this ancient form of literature and writing, and to also differentiate it from more mainstream traditional cultures.

What the song is trying to express, at least in my opinion is the manifested hatred and grudge of Azhdaha after being sealed underground for thousands of years. It's not just the hatred of having lost previously or hatred for Morax but the deep hatred of being sealed alive and watching as he is forgotten and alienated by the world. These overwhelming emotions are written into the powerful lyrics combined with Yu-Peng Chen's majestic orchestral music, electric guitar, and erhu. We were successful in presenting this impactful combat BGM.
