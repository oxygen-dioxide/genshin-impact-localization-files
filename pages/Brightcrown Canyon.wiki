|[[Entrance to Stormterror's Lair]]
|The entrance to Stormterror's Lair is a notable set of ruins built in the [[Decarabian's Mondstadt#Architecture and Design|Decarabian style]] that leads directly into [[Decarabian]]'s capital city. Soldiers used to be stationed along the road in Brightcrown Canyon leading into the city.<ref name="TTG1">{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|1}}</ref> In-game, the road leading out of the city leads to the boar habitat to the south; whether there were other parts of the road that have since been lost is a mystery.

|- id="Boar Habitat"
|[[Boar Habitat]]
|Following the path out of the entrance to Stormterror's Lair, marked by the worn dirt and crumbled pillars in the Decarabian style, eventually leads to a field naturally enclosed by ridges. This area is notable for its unusually high number of [[Forest Boar]]s.<br />At the center of the field is a wooden {{w|bell-cot}}. Its architectural style does not match that of the ruins in the area and instead uses a roofing style seen on houses in [[Springvale]], which are built in the traditional [[Classic Country Home]] style. However, without further details, it is impossible to discern when this structure was built and for what purpose.

==Lore==
Little is known about the Brightcrown Canyon area, but some deductions can be made based on the environment. Based on the level of wear on the path between the city and the boar habitat, it is highly likely that people from the city used it as a source of food. Decarabian's former lover [[Amos]] was a huntress,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Amos' Bow}}</ref> which further suggests that hunting was practiced in Old Mondstadt.

In recent history, [[Alice]] destroyed parts of the ruins in Brightcrown Canyon while conducting an experiment to control Ruin Guards with Hilichurls. The experiment was ultimately a failure.<ref name="TTG1" />
