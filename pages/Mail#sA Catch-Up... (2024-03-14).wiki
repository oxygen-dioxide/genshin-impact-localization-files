Last night, I received a letter and a gift from my [[Frederica Gunnhildr|mother]]. During the course of the expedition, she's managed to get her hands on a fine sword, light and easy to swing. She said that she hoped it would help me vanquish monsters more easily.

After reading the letter, I couldn't help but reflect on how things have changed recently, staring through the window at the quiet scenery outside as though lost in a trance.

In actual fact, the number of monsters around [[Mondstadt]] has greatly decreased during the time my mother has been away. The Knights of Favonius who stayed behind have matured and blossomed, meaning that the immense pressure I faced is gradually lessening too.

Of course, much of this is thanks to you.

If you're free today, why not come by the [[Knights of Favonius]]?

I'll be making a special pizza today, with what I like to think is the ideal balance of toppings. Neither too heavy, nor too light &mdash; perfect for a catch-up.
