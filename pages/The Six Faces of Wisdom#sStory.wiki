:'''Alhaitham:''' You would like to know what kind of literature an Akademiya student needs to read every day?
:'''Alhaitham:''' Then I recommend you look at these first. They're easy to get started on. Even Paimon would understand.
:'''Paimon:''' [[File:Icon_Emoji_Paimon's_Paintings_01_Paimon_1.png|20x20px]] Hey! Paimon heard that! What do you mean "even Paimon would understand"!?
:'''Paimon:''' [[File:Icon_Emoji_Paimon's_Paintings_01_Paimon_1.png|20x20px]] You may have a point... but it doesnt make it any less upsetting!
:'''Traveler:''' Paimon, that's just how he is.
:'''Traveler:''' You should study hard and improve every day.
:'''Paimon:''' [[File:Icon_Emoji_Paimon's_Paintings_01_Paimon_3.png|20x20px]] Paimon gets it...
:'''Alhaitham:''' That's right. The Akademiya has Six Darshans, so you could start by knowing how to distinguish the different categories of academic articles.
:'''Alhaitham:''' Traveler, you should be able to understand their respective areas of research, so why don't you help her out?
:'''Paimon:''' [[File:Icon_Emoji_Paimon's_Paintings_01_Paimon_3.png|20x20px]] Okay! Traveler, please help me!
:'''Paimon:''' [[File:Icon_Emoji_Paimon's_Paintings_01_Paimon_5.png|20x20px]] ...No, wait. Why does Paimon get the feeling that you mean something else!
