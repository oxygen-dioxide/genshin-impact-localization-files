|description  = A core retrieved from within the body of a defeated [[Avatar of Lava]].<br>It emits a considerable heat.<br>It is said that once such a core has formed, left to itself, it will develop into a new Avatar of Lava. In ancient times, it was once believed that all forms of life could be traced back to [[phlogiston|conflagration]], and that in the spark of burning matter lay the origins of the soul and sentient wisdom. Perhaps the very existence of Avatar of Lava would bear out such a belief - or perhaps it was the emergence of this theory itself that explains how they came to inhabit the land of [[Natlan]]...
