{{Description|Once upon a time, these were knights of the realm and carriers of significant status. The long years and a curse seems to have robbed them of their reason and memory. Now, all that remains within that armor is the will to "fight for something, someone, and some matter."<br />Depending on how much wear and tear they have undergone, they are by turns known as "Shadowy Husks" or "Black Serpent Knights."}}
'''Shadowy Husks''', also known as the "'''The Black Serpents'''" in the [[Adventurer Handbook]] or '''Black Serpent Knights''' are an Enemy Group.

Currently they come in four elements: {{Pyro}}, {{Hydro}}, {{Cryo}} and {{Anemo}}.

==Description==
These silent monsters were originally members of [[Khaenri'ah]]'s Royal Guard under their captain [[Dainsleif]] before the nation's fall. Ever since the [[Cataclysm]], they have been suffering from their curse, losing most of their humanity in the process. Depending on how far they've degraded, they're either referred to as Shadowy Husks or Black Serpent Knights.

==Strategy==
Husks are durable enemies; despite being armored monsters, they have low weight and are easy to [[Interruption Resistance|stagger]]. Their attacks have a very slow start-up time, making them very easy to dodge.

When they successfully attack a player who is [[shield]]ed (including [[Crystallize]]), they will apply a buff onto themselves and any other nearby husks if applicable at the cost of losing a percentage of their health. The effect can stack and/or refresh multiple times, although their slow attack speed means that players should not have any difficulty in dodging their attacks and preventing the buffs, even when shielded.
