===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Aphid Treasure Trace 1.png
|text1  = Abyss-corroded Phlogiston Aphids will be protected by special Wards that, before they break, will prevent your attacks from {{Color|help|depleting Abyssal power}}.<br>Once its Ward is broken, the Aphid will be stunned, and while the Ward is broken, each attack by a character can {{Color|help|deplete a specific amount}} of Abyssal power. {{Color|help|Nightsoul-aligned attacks}} or {{Color|help|higher-frequency}} attacks can deplete Abyssal power more quickly.
|image2 = Tutorial Aphid Treasure Trace 2.png
|text2  = Deploying Xilonen's {{Color|help|insect net}} within its effective range can {{Color|help|greatly damage a Ward}} and trap Aphids. Characters' attacks can damage their Wards, and {{Color|help|Nightsoul-aligned attacks}} can do so more effectively.
|image3 = Tutorial Aphid Treasure Trace 3.png
|text3  = The insect net needs to charge up before being used. Collect Shackleberries to charge the net and restore some Phlogiston.<br>The challenges will contain Shackleberry plants and objects that contain these berries. Defeating certain opponents will also grant a small amount of Shackleberries.
|image4 = Tutorial Aphid Treasure Trace 4.png
|text4  = If Aphids corrupted by Abyssal power are attacked, they will flee to the next zone after a period of time.<br>If their Wards have been broken, Abyss-corroded Phlogiston Aphids will immediately flee to the next zone once they recover from their stunned state. There is a {{Color|help|fixed upper limit}} to the amount of Abyssal power that can be depleted each time the Ward is broken.
