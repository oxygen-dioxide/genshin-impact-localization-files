|description     = A dish deep-fried in oil.
|desc_suspicious = Perhaps it is an inexperience in controlling oil temperatures showing, but the ingredients began giving off a pungent smoke the instant they were dipped into the wok. The batter is now all mottled and browned. Shame about the waste... but best not to eat it, perhaps.
|desc_basic      = Incorporate the marinated sakura blossom petals into the batter before giving the fresh shrimp and vegetables an even coating, frying, and then draining the oil. This all sounds simple enough, but good tempura making is not something achieved in a mere day.
|desc_delicious  = The batter is thin and sheer, like a set of luxurious clothes over the ingredients. The outside crispness and freshness within form amazing layers of texture, leading those who eat it to marvel at just how this delicacy was created.

'''Sakura Tempura''' {{Lang|ja=緋櫻天ぷら|ja_rm=Hiou Tenpura}} is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The recipe is obtainable by completing the {{Quest|Gourmet Supremos, Assemble!}}.

Depending on the quality, Sakura Tempura increases all party members' [[Shield]] Strength by '''20'''/'''25'''/'''30'''% for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

When [[Kamisato Ayato]] cooks Sakura Tempura, there is a chance [[Quiet Elegance]] will be created instead.
