{{Quest Description|These strange lines of text seem to hide some secret...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Soraya)
:'''Soraya:''' ...How many secrets does Liyue truly hold?
:{{DIcon}} Secrets?
::'''Soraya:''' Oh, Traveler, it's you. The secrets I'm referring to are a set of inscriptions.
:{{DIcon}} Do you mean buried treasure?
::'''Soraya:''' Haha, who knows? It's always possible. Talk of secrets waiting to be uncovered does tend to make one think of buried treasure.
:'''Soraya:''' This place we are in is called the [[Guili Assembly]]. According to Liyue folklore, it was once inhabited by people &mdash; in fact, it was rather prosperous.
:'''Soraya:''' But for various reasons, the whole place was wiped out. All that remains now is the countless ruins scattered across the landscape.
:'''Soraya:''' Some stories put it down to conflict between the gods, other people say it was a war between humans. And some sources talk of a sudden, catastrophic natural disaster...
:'''Soraya:''' Whatever the reason was, ruins are all that remains here now. The only ones who come here are the hilichurls, the Treasure Hoarders...
:'''Soraya:''' ...And masochistic scholars, like me, who in spite of all the risks just can't resist the idea of how much research value these ruins have to offer.
:'''Soraya:''' In practice though, scholars like me aren't cut out for this kind of field work! I've hardly covered any ground yet, and I already need a rest...
:'''Soraya:''' The actual ruin-exploring seems more your area of expertise. What do you say, fancy helping me out?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Soraya:''' Great. Hmm, but I should give you an idea of what to look for... Yes, keep your eyes peeled for stone pillars and stone tablets.
::'''Soraya:''' Given how ancient these ruins are, any text we can hope to find will be written on stone, not paper.
::'''Soraya:''' After all, stone is the oldest and most durable medium for written communication.
:{{DIcon}} What am I looking for?
::'''Soraya:''' Hmm... Text essentially. Written messages from the past.
::'''Soraya:''' And if you're looking for text in ruins as ancient as these, that means looking for stone pillars and stone tablets.
::'''Soraya:''' Stone is the oldest, most durable medium for written communication. All the more so in the domain of the Geo Archon.
::'''Soraya:''' The stones here have borne witness to all of history. I am sure they will not disappoint.
:{{DIcon}} Only if there's treasure...
::'''Soraya:''' Whatever treasure you find, you can keep. Material wealth isn't what appeals to me.
::'''Soraya:''' In Liyue there's a saying that goes: "Money belongs to the world outside your head." I'm more interested in acquiring knowledge than money.
::'''Soraya:''' So while you're hunting for treasure, please also keep your eyes peeled for stone pillars and stone tablets.
::'''Soraya:''' Given how ancient these ruins are, any knowledge we can hope to find will most likely be written on stone.

;(Investigating the west tablet)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like there's some writing here. Let's note it down.
;(Investigating the north tablet)
:'''Paimon:''' Does that even mean anything? Well, might as well write it down.
;(Investigating the southwest tablet)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon found some writing! Let's make a copy.
;(Investigating the middle-south tablet)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? There's some writing here. Come on, let's take a look.
;(Investigating the east tablet)
:'''Paimon:''' There's some writing on this stone tablet.
----
;(Talk to Soraya again)
:'''Soraya:''' Find anything in the ruins?
:{{DIcon}} I found five stone tablets.
:'''Soraya:''' Great! Let's see... Ugh, these are all over the place. Let me see if I can work out the right order...
:'''Soraya:''' ...Hmm, there's a lot of missing text here, so it's quite disjointed. Also, I'm still not sure on the order...
:'''Soraya:''' But anyway, this is my best guess. If I line up like this, it reads as follows:
:'''Soraya:''' "...In the beginning, when the people assembled to farm the land... A god named [[Guizhong]] descended, whose dominion was over Dust, and whose reach shrouded the skies for thousands of miles around..."
:'''Soraya:''' "...The god laid down four commandments for the people... Then another god descended, whose dominion was over Geo, and who brought the people of Liyue to this place. Jointly they shepherded the people for their protection..."
:'''Soraya:''' "...And the assembly was named Guili after the names of the two gods..."
:'''Soraya:''' It seems to be about the history of the Guili Assembly. And a god with power over dust, who watched over this place.
:'''Soraya:''' But it also mentions another god who came here at some point, and even brought some of their people with them.
:'''Soraya:''' Also, it seems to be saying that the name 'Guili', as in Guili Assembly, came about by taking one syllable each from the names of these two gods.
:'''Soraya:''' How fascinating. In all the documents I've ever read, I've never come across any mention of two gods who coexisted peacefully... let alone who actively worked together...
:'''Soraya:''' It seems they were more than two allied gods &mdash; they were best friends.
:'''Soraya:''' But what happened to them? They can't have just... disappeared?
:'''Soraya:''' And how was the Guili Assembly laid to waste so completely? With two gods watching over it, no disaster should have been quite so devastating. Natural or otherwise.
:'''Soraya:''' Which means whatever happened was beyond even the gods' powers to withstand...
:'''Soraya:''' Traveler, could you keep looking for more clues? Unless I'm mistaken, there should be more stone tablets around here, just like the ones you have seen already.
:'''Soraya:''' Maybe they will tell the story of what happened next...
:'''Soraya:''' That which is recorded on these stone tablets seems to differ in some places from those in some documents.
:'''Soraya:''' *sigh* So many legends, so many tellings... Which of these is the truth, I wonder...
----
;(Investigating the west ruin)
:'''Paimon:''' So many words have faded... Let's ignore those and just copy down the rest.
;(Investigating the east ruin)
:'''Paimon:''' There's so much writing on this stone tablet, but lots of it is unreadable... Let's copy down the parts we can read for now.
----
;(Talk to Soraya again)
:'''Soraya:''' Ah, you're back. I was starting to wonder how much longer I'd have to wait. Found anything?
:{{DIcon}} Two more stone tablets.
:'''Soraya:''' Ooh, let me see!
:'''Soraya:''' "...and there they fought upon the Guili Plains, where black dust choked the heavens and a thousand rocks splintered..."
:'''Soraya:''' Oh my... It appears to be saying that a battle once took place on the Guili Plains. And an enormous battle at that...
:'''Soraya:''' That must have been the battle in which Guili Assembly fell. But as for this other passage...
:'''Soraya:''' ...It seems to have been written by someone who couldn't bring themselves to leave their home. So they stayed here. And what's more...
:{{DIcon}} ...There's treasure.
:'''Soraya:''' ...Clearly you have a fondness for treasure. But you're not wrong, there is indeed treasure in the Guili Plains if this passage is to be taken literally.
:'''Soraya:''' But then we have... "Guizhong's Four Commandments shall guide those in generations to come who aspire to find it," followed by:
:'''Soraya:''' "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition &mdash; the convergence of these four shall be known as the 'Guili Assembly.'"
:'''Soraya:''' How does one decipher that? I wouldn't know where to start.
:'''Soraya:''' Let's head back to Wangshu Inn. I think we all need some down time before we try to tackle the riddle of Guizhong's Four Commandments.

===Text from the Tablets===
The following tablet excerpts were arranged by Soraya based on context, and may not be their actual order.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Stone Tablet:''' "...In the beginning, when the people assembled to farm the land..."

:'''Stone Tablet:''' "...A god named [[Guizhong]] descended, whose dominion was over Dust, and whose reach shrouded the skies for thousands of miles around..."

:'''Stone Tablet:''' "...The god laid down four commandments for the people..."

:'''Stone Tablet:''' "...Then [[Morax|another god]] descended, whose dominion was over Geo, and who brought the people of Liyue to this place. Jointly they shepherded the people for their protection..."

:'''Stone Tablet:''' "...And the assembly was named Guili after the names of the two gods..."

:'''Stone Tablet:''' "...and there they fought upon the Guili Plains, where black dust choked the heavens and a thousand rocks splintered..."

:'''Stone Tablet:''' "Guizhong's Four Commandments are: "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition &mdash; the convergence of these four shall be known as the '[[Guili Assembly]].'"

:'''Stone Tablet:''' "...One can bear not to leave one's native land. A treasure lies in Guili, and Guizhong's Four Commandments shall guide those in generations to come who aspire to find it, if they would test themselves against the Four."

==Trivia==
*[[Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I]] makes it clear that the other god who ruled over Guili Plains was [[Morax]]. While his name at the time is unknown, his current mortal alias, [[Zhongli]], uses the same {{Lang|mini=1|zh=离|zh_rm=lí}} character in {{Lang|mini=1|zh=归离|zh_rm=Guīlí}}.
* The intended interpretation of the line "In all the documents I've ever read, I've never come across any mention of two gods who coexisted peacefully... let alone who actively worked together..." combined with the publicly known friendship between [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] and the [[Goddess of Flowers]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref> is unclear. Any of the following are possible:
** Soraya is not as good of a scholar as players are led to believe.
** There are few to no accessible documents on the Goddess of Flowers, and all of the knowledge about her has been passed down orally.
** This line was forgotten by HoYoverse. This is concretely possible, given all of the following: ''Treasure Lost, Treasure Found'' was released in [[Version 1.0]], far before the release of both [[Sumeru]] and the {{Dendro}} element in [[Version 3.0]]; Dendro's [[elemental reaction]]s had a lot of thought put into them<ref name="sumeru teaser 1 dendro">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/6DjVUfy_Lng Sumeru Preview Teaser 01: The Fascinating Dendro Element]</ref> and likely had a lot of development after Version 1.0; the [[Catalyze]] elemental reaction was specifically noted to have a connection to Sumeru's history,<ref name="sumeru teaser 1 dendro" /> and while the connection is still unclear, it is theorized to be connected to the relationship between the Goddess of Flowers and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.<ref group="Note">See {{S|Catalyze#Trivia}} for details on the theory connecting the relationship between the Goddess of Flowers and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata to the Catalyze elemental reaction.</ref>
