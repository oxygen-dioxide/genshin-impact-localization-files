'''Tri-Yana Seed''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Sumeru]].

These seeds have three states depending on the [[element]] applied to it &mdash; Scorched, Normal, and Activated.
* Normal ({{Dendro}}): They will move along a fixed path.
* Scorched by {{Pyro}}: They will stop moving.
* Activated by {{Electro}}: They will release a large [[Truesense Pulse]].

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Tri-Yana is a combination of two Sanskrit words ''Tri'' meaning "three" and {{lang|{{w|Yana (Buddhism)|''Yana''}}|sa=यान}} meaning "to move". Hence, Tri-Yana means "showing three movements".
