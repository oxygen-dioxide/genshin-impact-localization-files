'''Bouncy Mushrooms''' are a type of [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]] found in [[Sumeru]].

When landing on a Bouncy Mushroom, it will launch the player into the air. While Activated, it will launch the player even higher. While Scorched, it will not launch the player.

==Variants==
Apart from the normal Bouncy Mushroom, two other variants of this object can be found in the game:
* A special yellow Bouncy Mushroom can be found in the [[The Measure of a Mushroom]] Commission as well as various [[Domain]]s in Sumeru.
* A special green Bouncy Mushrooms featuring a four-leaf-clover pattern, known as Floating Mushrooms,<!--as displayed in the Seven Dish Dance challenge prompts, although that prompt isn't on the wiki--> can also be found as midair bouncing platforms in various challenges in [[Girdle of the Sands]].

These special Bouncy Mushrooms are not Tri-Lakshana Creatures and cannot become Activated or Scorched, notably lacking the white fluff that appears under [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]]s.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Landing on the Bouncy Mushroom does not prevent [[Fall Damage]].
** Should the active character die from Fall Damage upon landing, Bouncy Mushroom would still activate and launch them into the air for a shorter distance.
