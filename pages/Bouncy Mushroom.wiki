'''Bouncy Mushrooms''' are a type of [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]] found in [[Sumeru]].

When landing on a Bouncy Mushroom, it will launch the player into the air. While Activated, it will launch the player even higher. While Scorched, it will not launch the player.

A special type of Bouncy Mushroom can be found in the [[The Measure of a Mushroom]] Commission as well as various [[Domain]]s in Sumeru. These Bouncy Mushrooms are not Tri-Lakshana Creatures and cannot become Activated or Scorched, notably lacking the white fluff that appear under [[Tri-Lakshana Creature|Tri-Lakshana Creatures]].
