==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Aucelet is part of the Beret Society and [[Dougier]]'s subordinate. Being one of the more "docile" and obedient members, Aucelet was sent to greet Wriothesley and the Traveler to put on a performance and make the Beret Society look good. Later it is found out that Aucelet was following a script and was being monitored by Dougier through a security camera. When the Traveler confronted Aucelet later, Aucelet was paralyzed, not knowing how to act, fearing that he would be punished for making a wrong move.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Proud "Beret Society"}}</ref> Later, Aucelet is arrested by Wriothesley's guards for collusion in a scheme in the Beret Society and fraud.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|It's What He Deserves}}</ref>
