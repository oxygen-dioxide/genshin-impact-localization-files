==Description==
In old Mondstadt, spear arts were forbidden by the nobility.<br>
Ostensibly, they claimed that only the sword was worthy of noble stock,<br>
But they say that in reality, it was because the length of polearms could bridge the gaps in training,<br>
Which might grant the unarmed and unschooled commoners a weapon with which to resist.
