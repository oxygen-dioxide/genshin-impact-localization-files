'''Arkhium Stock''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained upon collecting all seven of the {{Item|Mysterious Ore}} pieces scattered throughout Fontaine. After the seventh one has been picked up, the stack is removed from the player's inventory, and the Arkhium Stock item gets added in its place.

The Arkhium Stock can be further refined into {{Item|Arkhium Lumenite}} at [[Bravais' Press Works]] for the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[Arkhium Forge]]''.
