'''Enlightened One''' is [[Raiden Shogun]]'s [[4th Ascension Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The energy restoration bonus increases the flat energy produced by Musou Isshin for her party members (including herself) by 0.6% per 1% of Raiden's bonus [[Attributes#Energy Recharge|Energy Recharge]]. Despite the in-game description, this bonus does not exclusively benefit herself. For example; with 200% bonus Energy Recharge (300% total), this effect will cause Musou Isshin to produce 120% more energy, resulting in 5.5 energy instead of 2.5 per activation at level 10, and a maximum of 27.5 over its duration, all of which will be received by both herself and her team.
* Because the energy restored by Musou Isshin is still a flat amount, it will not be directly affected by the individual recipients' respective Energy Recharge stats. Regardless of if Raiden herself has 300% Energy Recharge while her allies respectively have 100, 200, and 180%, all of them will still gain exactly 27.5 Energy.
