==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Momoko''': I wonder, are Miss Kiyoko's goods too cheap...
:{{DIcon}} Isn't it better if the prices are affordable?
::'''Momoko''': Well, for people like us who rely on her for the purchase of daily necessities, the cheaper the better.
::'''Momoko''': In the beginning, the prices were so low that everyone suspected that she might have ulterior motives... Now that I think of it, that was uncalled-for behavior on our part.
::'''Momoko''': Miss Kiyoko truly is friendly and good-hearted, having given up higher profit margins so that she could give us more conveniences and better living standards.
::'''Momoko''': Thanks to her, everyone in the village can buy goods easily and can sometimes even get some new and interesting things.
::'''Momoko''': Speaking of that, I did buy some new fabrics some time back. Once [[Moriguchi|my husband]] gets back, I'll make him some new clothes...
::{{DIcon}} Your husband?
::'''Momoko''': My husband is a soldier in the Sangonomiya forces. He's currently stationed near Yashiori Island.
::'''Momoko''': I'm not all too familiar with the situation out there. My husband's letters don't mention the war at all. His letters are full of assurances that he's well and that there's no need to worry...
::'''Momoko''': But to tell the truth, how can I not worry about him, as his wife?
::'''Momoko''': *sigh* I miss the days when we had no such cares. When times got busy, we would be busy together. When we were free, we would watch the flowers together...
::'''Momoko''': May Watatsumi Omikami watch over my husband and ensure his safe return.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I hope that you'll meet again soon.
:::'''Momoko''': I hope so too.
:::'''Momoko''': Ah, yes, I have some food that I made here. I was going to give them to Miss Kiyoko, but you can have some too.
:::'''Momoko''': It's just an ordinary meal, but if you don't mind, please give it a try.
::;(Obtain Delicious [[Grilled Unagi Fillet]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Momoko''': Mm, see you.
