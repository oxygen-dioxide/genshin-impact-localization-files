|description    = A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.<br>This lizard has blue scales with beautiful patterns that gradually change color and seems to feed off [[Crystal Marrow]].<br>The lizard's tail has special medicinal properties when dried and ground into powder. Some mad alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosives.<br>Once separated from the body, the tail will lose its vitality and curl up.
