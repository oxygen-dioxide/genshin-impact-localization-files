==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You helped Aragaru defeat The Eremites in Chatrakam Cave. Their goal, however, seems to be related to a friendship that Aragaru has forgotten...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Enter the cave)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? The Eremites! What are they doing here?

;(Investigate a nearby spot)
:'''Paimon:''' Mmm... Nope, nothing here but a bunch of supplies.

;(Fight the Eremites at the camp)
:'''Paimon:''' There must be more of them here... Are they here for the Aranara?
:'''Paimon:''' Gah! We've got to go teach them a lesson!

;(Fight Azrul)
:'''The Farrokhzadan:''' Ah, it's you. Greetings from [[Lunja]]!

;(After defeating [[Azrul]])
:'''Aragaru:''' Golden Nara and White Floaty, you are here again!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Say hello before jumping out next time! You scared Paimon again!
:{{DIcon}} We're not bad guys.
:{{DIcon}} We chased the bad guys away for you.
:'''Aragaru:''' Hmph... You're right... So, Golden Nara and White Floaty who don't look like bad guys, could you do me a favor?
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing. I'm (Traveler).
:'''Paimon:''' And Paimon is Paimon, don't forget that again!
:'''Aragaru:''' Again...? Uh... Ahem, I'm Aragaru!
:'''Paimon:''' We have been here with you, but you forgot it all... Ugh, too much explanation! (Traveler), why don't we do that together?

:'''You describe your adventure with Aragaru in detail.'''

:'''Aragaru:''' Is that so...? I can't remember, but I somehow want to believe you... And you have the flower I gave, I can feel her.
:'''Aragaru:''' Ah, right! The bad Nara set up a campsite. Let's see what they left there. Maybe we could know their plans!

;(Talk to Aragaru again)
:'''Aragaru:''' Let's go to the bad Nara's campsite and find out what they're up to!
:{{DIcon}} How can you tell if someone's bad?
:'''Aragaru:''' Well, I can't really explain it, but Nara (Traveler) and White Floaty are not baddies for sure! I believe that!

;(Investigate the camp)
:'''Paimon:''' Nope, nothing's here... But why have they made camp here?

;(Approach the letter at the camp)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What's this? A letter? Let's take a careful look!

;(Read the Employer's Orders)
::'''Employer's Orders'''
::Find and secure a small plant-shaped creature known as the "Aranara" and bring it back to the Academia in perfect shape. The meeting point will be decided when the time comes. This life-form may not be visible to the naked eye. If possible, please ask young children to talk to it, and use the opportunity to catch it. Protect it, if necessary.
::Please protect this dried flower. It may be the key to communicating with the creature know as the 'Aranara.'
::You may grumble that this is ridiculous and boring. But before you do that, please think about completing a commission that Agha Farrokh's daughter has personally entrusted to you...
::...And of the rewards and reputation you'll gain from completing it.
::— [[Siman Farrokhzad]]
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. So there's someone behind these bad guys...
;(Obtain [[Little Dried Flower]])

;(Talk to Aragaru)
:'''Aragaru:''' How is it? Did you find anything?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Nothing but vague orders, and this! A dried flower!
:'''Aragaru:''' Eh...! This flower, can I have it?
:'''Paimon:''' That's from the bad guys, aren't you afraid of getting poisoned... or something like that?
:'''Aragaru:''' No need to worry, I have seen the flower before... The person, I should know... Please give it to me, okay?
:{{DIcon}} Of course, here.
:'''Aragaru:''' Thank you! Nara (Traveler) and White Floaty!

:'''Aragaru brought the little dried flower to Mawtiyima Forest...'''
