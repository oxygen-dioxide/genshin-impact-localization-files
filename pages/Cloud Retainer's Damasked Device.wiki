'''Cloud Retainer's Damasked Device''' is a commemorative event gadget that can be obtained from the ''[[Of Travels and Treasures: A Thank-You Gift]]'' [[event]]. It is claimable via in-game mail.

Cloud Retainer's Damasked Device is not a true gadget and is merely toggled on when equipped, thus regular gadgets can still be used as per normal. It will also temporarily disappear when in combat mode and while underwater.

This mechanical bird was meant to be a prototype for a flying sightseeing vehicle that could seat multiple people, but it proved to be too difficult for [[Xianyun]] to realize. She wishes she had [[Guizhong]]'s input available.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xianyun|Something to Share|quote='''Xianyun:''' [...] *sigh* If only Guizhong were still here. She, no doubt, would offer many baffling but ingenious solutions to this conundrum.}}</ref>

==Gameplay Notes==
* It cannot be used at the same time as any other [[Gadget]] of the "Equipment" type.
