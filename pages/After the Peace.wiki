{{Quest Description|Tonight, you hear a familiar voice in your dreams...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter your room in the [[Weary Inn]])
:{{A|vo mwklq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lately we've been sleeping well, and eating even better... now this is the life!
:{{DIcon}} About time we got to live like this.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! Heehee, look, Paimon's tummy is so stuffed, it's all round and plump now...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn* &mdash;And now it's time for some rest! Mmm...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What a peaceful feeling... We're normally so busy, it's nice to have some downtime like this every once in a while between adventures.)
:{{A|vo mwklq001 1 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' We've got trouble!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' !?
:{{DIcon}} (That voice... is that [[Citlali]]?)
::{{DIcon}} To hear your voice at a time like this is truly an honor, Granny Itztli...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 1 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Cut that out, it's serious! And what are doing sleeping this late? Who are you, me?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 1 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Come see us in the Speaker's Chamber once you've cleaned yourselves up. We're waiting for you here.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (So much for sleeping in... Guess we'll have to head over there.)
:{{DIcon}} Wake up, Paimon, we've gotta go find [[Mavuika]].
:{{A|vo mwklq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nooo, Paimon's not done eating yet... Huh? Oh... Good morning...
:{{Black Screen|After explaining the situation to Paimon, you quickly wash up and head to the Speaker's Chamber...}}
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Tonight, you hear a familiar voice in your dreams. Mavuika and Citlali invite you to the Speaker's Chamber for a discussion, and once there, Mavuika shares her idea with you &mdash; namely, that she plans to hold the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]] once again. Citlali, meanwhile, brings another piece of surprising news...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter the Speaker's Chamber)
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 01a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 01b.ogg}}--> '''Citlali:''' I wonder if they've eaten... Or if they've even gotten up... Hmm, maybe I should buy some snacks?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Oh, don't tell me something came up on their way here...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Relax. I'm sure they're fine.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ah, there they are!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' See, just like I said.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mavuika, Citlali! We came running as soon as we got your message!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thank you for coming all this way. Here, have some water and catch your breath first.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like something major happened.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, you could certainly say that... I'll let Citlali explain.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ahem... Strictly speaking, I'm just passing on something I heard as well. Basically, the [[Wayob]] passed a truly shocking piece of news to me through the smoke last night.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You're aware that Mavuika's not the first [[Pyro Archon]], yes? On occasion, there were those who lived longer than an ordinary human, not unlike my situation. But, all in all, the title has changed hands many times.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' And now, the Wayob have sensed a special surge within the [[Ley Line]]s. A truly ancient soul is about to return to the mortal realm.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' His name... is [[Xbalanque]].
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xbalanque!? But isn't he... Isn't he the very very first...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes, that's him. The first Pyro Archon.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' According to legend, he was the greatest of heroes and leaders, and the one who made a deal with the [[Ronova|Ruler of Death]], thereby creating the rules that saved Natlan's Ley Lines.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hasn't he been dead like, a really long time? How can he be resurrected?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even in Natlan, it's impossible for someone as ancient as him to ever return... Still, nothing's off the table when Xbalanque's concerned.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hence, why this really is "something major."
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Let me be clear about this: I did not mishear, nor is the Wayob mistaken! We would never jest about something like this.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Don't worry, both {{Traveler}} and I have complete faith in your abilities. Whose interpretation of the Wayob's will could we trust, if not yours?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Yeah, that's the one thing I'll never be modest about. But the fact I'm not wrong about this only further begs the question &mdash; just why is Lord Xbalanque suddenly about to be resurrected now?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As you can see, Citlali's even more concerned about this than I am.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Still, it's understandable. Waiting to find out the whole truth must be torture for a great shaman who can only peep at the outcomes without knowing the causes.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Mavuika, I hope you'll approach this with a measure of caution. Depending on how things go, everything could change, or nothing at all... I think you know what I mean.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I do. Xbalanque's arrival will shake our nation. After all, we still don't know if he's satisfied with the outcome of this war.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, do you think he'll come and find you?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ah! You can't just up and say things like that, you scared me half to death!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's actually pretty likely. Think about it, people in the same line of work tend to have some similarities, right? Maybe all Pyro Archons share my disposition.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...I don't want to meet him! I&mdash;I haven't really mentally prepared myself yet for such a... grand occasion!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 13.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Anyway, my job was just to pass on the message and bring {{Traveler}} over. Now that that's dealt with, you can discuss the Pilgrimage. I'm done here.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait! Where are you going, Citlali?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Back to bed! You have no idea how much that scared me &mdash; I was up all night... Ugh, I can barely keep my eyes open... Nighty night.
:{{DIcon}} Alright then, what's this about the Pilgrimage?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's like I said before. Our cultural legacy shouldn't end with our triumph over our suffering. Instead, it will burn brighter than ever.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame has been given new meaning. We have chosen to turn it into a pure athletic competition, promoting fair play and encouraging the personal growth of contestants.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And... this grand tournament will begin soon.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woo! That sounds awesome!
:{{DIcon}} I'm itching to sign up!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Heroes are drawn to tournaments like this, and naturally, you're no exception.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The news of Lord Xbalanque's impending resurrection may be a bombshell, but I believe that we should keep our focus on the Pilgrimage.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, okay... So, not in a hurry to find him, huh?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right. I have already informed the tribes that we'll be hosting the next tournament right away. It'll help sweep away the shadows cast by the war.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Preparing supplies, cleaning up and remodeling the competition venues, recruiting staff for logistics, moral support, and pre-tournament weather forecasting... All of that's been assigned. We need to make sure everything is completed well and on schedule first.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 21.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon. You are our cherished friends, and a part of our nation, and I would like to invite you to serve as special supervisors for this event.
:{{DIcon}} It would be my honor.
:{{DIcon}} When do I start?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' P&mdash;Paimon can do it, too?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Of course. On that note, my two new supervisors, would you come with me to check on the progress of each of the tribes?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure!
----
;(Approach the People of the Springs)
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're here! This is our first stop.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, looks like someone's in a good mood.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course! Paimon's here as a special supervisor this time! Hehe, it's only been a few days, but Paimon's back and cooler than ever!
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, Paimon can be a lot...
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, Paimon's letting this get to her head again...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ah, it's nothing. We've got a long road ahead, so it's good that she's so motivated.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Pretty much all we need to do is talk to everyone and confirm how the preparations for the Pilgrimage are going.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold a sec, take a look over there...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See that? Someone's fishing... Ah, it's them!
:{{DIcon}} Ah, our iconic trio.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' It's a quartet, you insolent ignoramuses, a quartet! How dare you treat the Almighty Dragonlord like a subhuman? If anything, I'm superhuman! ...Wait, no, draconian!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Why, hello there, [[Ajaw]], and you three. What are you up to?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' We're fishing, Archon! [[Mualani]] says if we're lucky, we might catch someone really special!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Yeah, like that punk, Xbalanque. Pah! He's such a pathetic little&mdash; Gwargh!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' My apologies. Ajaw clearly hasn't earned his ticket to see the sun today. We didn't mean any offense &mdash; when [[Kachina]] and Mualani were talking about "fishing," they meant it literally, with hook and bait.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Lowly servant! How dare you beat up the Almighty Dragonlord for some ancient fogey that you only know by name! You'll pay for this... I'll start with some chili in your water skin...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ah, so you've heard about his impending return. Did Citlali mention that to you?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Mhm, we ran into her on the road not too long ago. She seemed to be falling asleep standing up, and kept mumbling about something...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' "Oh no, oh no, why is Xbalanque coming back now? Did we screw something up? We couldn't have, right? But what else could have alarmed him so much..."
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that sounds just like her...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' And now that you're done, scram.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 ajaw 05.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Wah!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' To be honest, it's been bothering me quite a lot... Under normal circumstances, it shouldn't be possible for us to meet Lord Xbalanque, right? So... does this mean something's wrong?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' As you can see, there are many people that are thinking along those same lines. I believe that...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hey! We've got a bite!

:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 lostman 01.ogg}} '''Drowning Man:''' Help! Help! Something's pulling on me!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It's what's going to save your life! Are you having leg cramps?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 lostwoman 01.ogg}} '''Drowning Woman:''' I... *gurgle* *gurgle*...! Help... *gurgle*
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hold your breath for now! We'll get you out right away!
:{{Black Screen|With everyone's help, you manage to rescue the drowning people...}}
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 lostman 02.ogg}} '''Drowning Man:''' Ugh... *coughing*
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 lostwoman 02.ogg}} '''Drowning Woman:''' *cough* Thank you... so much, everyone... Wait, why is our Archon here... too... *cough*
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, would you look at that... You actually caught some people after all.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 lostwoman 03.ogg}} '''Drowning Woman:''' Thanks for your help... Otherwise, that sudden bout of leg cramps might have ended our entire surfing squad.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 lostwoman 04.ogg}} '''Drowning Woman:''' The two of us are in charge of transporting supplies. After safely delivering some of the equipment, medicine, and a few other things for the tournament, we had some time to spare, so...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Didn't warm up before going into the water, did ya?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 lostman 03.ogg}} '''Drowning Man:''' Thank you, thank you so much... We'll, um, leave you to it, then.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 lostwoman 05.ogg}} '''Drowning Woman:''' We'll never forget how you saved us! We know you're busy, though, so no need to worry about us &mdash; we'll see you around!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you gotta give it to Mualani, when she wants something to happen, then it just happens...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Then it won't be long before she reels in Xbalanque himself. Now that'll be a wonder of wonders...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehehe, I was just thinking, what if he enjoyed swimming like the rest of us? It's easy enough for anyone who loves the water to end up here, so might as well give it a try. It'd be a great chance to say hi to him!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I used some commemorative badges for the Stadium as a special bait. He's never been to present-day Natlan, so it'll all be new to him! I'm sure he'll be thrilled.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' And before you say anything &mdash; anything's possible! On the off chance this'll work, it's worth a try no matter how unlikely it is! Just like playing the lottery.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' As you can see, the power of friendship sustains their faith in the theory.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, what about you, then? Given your personality, isn't your continued presence a testament to the power of friendship, too?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 ajaw 06.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Haha, she saw right through you, my foolish lackey! Silly, naive child... Now, witness the scorn of K'uhul Aja&mdash;owww!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Picking up where we left off before... Citlali never makes mistakes with her messages, so I believe... that it would be best for you to meet with Lord Xbalanque. That should quell any unnecessary speculation.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But for now, what I need to do is check on the status of the preparations for the upcoming Pilgrimage.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...Hmm, seems like the People of the Springs have done a great job.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yup, don't worry! We only came here to fish after finishing all of our work. We're all done, all three of us!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Mhm! Everyone at the [[Children of Echoes]] has been hard at work too. I only came here after finishing my tasks for today. It looked like everyone else was about finished too.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kinich 07.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Same for the [[Scions of the Canopy]]. We're all wrapped up.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Now that's efficiency. I trust you. Well, looks like we won't have to make the trip to your tribes then.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Everyone, this iteration of the Pilgrimage holds great importance to Natlan as it is now. We must pull together and work as one, creating the best atmosphere possible for all our participants.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 ajaw 07.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Uh-huh, suuure. Dunno why you'd worry about this stuff. You're always so ready to pounce on and fight just about anything &mdash; why, you even dare to disrespect the almighty Dragonlord!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Remind me again, has Ajaw done anything besides talk?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 kinich 08.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I'll send the dirtiest jobs his way right this instant.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 ajaw 08.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' What are you doing to me, you son of a&mdash;!? Hey! Let me go!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's always a party with those three! Seems like we can check off the People of the Springs.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, four. Sorry, those four.

;(Talk to Ajaw, Kachina, [[Kinich]], or Mualani, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Everyone's been very efficient these past few days. Seems like lots of people are looking forward to participating in the tournament.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Hah! Why don't you sign up, then? Maybe someone'll manage to knock some sense through your thick skull!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Why don't we all join? It'd be a great chance to kick back and relax!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Relax? You find the idea of a tournament relaxing!? This girl is crazy... Ugh...
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Mualani's right. Let's all sign up together!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Huh? Even you? Pah, children. Think you're all grown-up, don't you? In the eyes of the great K'uhul Ajaw, you're still...
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Nobody asked. We'll go, you stay.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' What!? You little&mdash;!
----
;(Approach Citlali at the Masters of the Night-Wind)
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! There she is! Right over there!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Citlali! Didn't you say you were going to get some more sleep? Why are you still here?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' *sigh* [[Biram|The Chief]] came to me for help just now. Not like I can just ignore someone in need and go back to bed, now can I?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You didn't tell him that you stayed up all night?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I just told him about Xbalanque's imminent return, and told him to be prepared. There was no need to mention anything else.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right, you've still got a reputation to maintain, huh? Can't have people thinking Granny Itztli would lose sleep over something like this!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ugh, now you're making fun of me too, huh? Hmph, so even children are ridiculing me now. This cannot stand...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' And you! Do you also think I'm just trying to keep up appearances?
:{{DIcon}} Nope, not me, would never think that.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' And you too! What about you, Mavuika?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No, no, of course not.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Relax, Citlali.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Xbalanque was no ordinary person. He loved this land as much as we do, and managed to forge a miracle through the Ruler of Death. I don't think he'll give us too hard a time.
:{{DIcon}} Even though I've never known him...
:{{DIcon}} I feel the same way.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' *sigh* If that's what even the two of you think, then my worrying seems even more unnecessary. Alright, alright, I get it. That's just the kind of paranoid old hag I am.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' That means I can go get some shut-eye, then? You can take a look around yourselves. And if you need any help, feel free to go find the Chief, or Ororon.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The Chief should be overseeing the preparation of the woven scrolls required for the tournament right about now, and as for Ororon... I believe he said he was going to do some handicrafts at the valley entrance.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, come on, you're making it sound like it's my first time here. Rest well, and stop worrying so much. We'll discuss the tournament with Ororon.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 4 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Alright, then. Good night, everyone. And don't go thinking that Granny Itztli doesn't like hanging out with you just because she's not around all the time.

;(Approach Ororon)
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Hmm, what if I put this piece of rope... here? Oh, and this wooden dummy...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Nuh-uh!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' No? Then what about this...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 02.ogg}} '''???:''' No way, bro!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That voice... Sounds like Ororon's talking to someone. Let's go see what he's up to...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whatcha up to, Ororon?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Oh, hello.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh dear! Oh dear!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...A bird?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No, a juvenile [[Qucusaurus]]. This one looks a little different from the others, though... Yeah, a very special look indeed.
:{{DIcon}} Is he your pet, Ororon?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 04.ogg}} '''???:''' The heck are you on about?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, he's quick on his feet. That retort was instant...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 05.ogg}} '''???:''' For real, now? Do you even hear yourself, bro?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' H&mdash;Huh? Did Paimon just say something wrong?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh wow... No way, bro!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What the heck!?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Don't worry about him. He's just... Erm... How should I describe him...
:{{DIcon}} Don't tell me he's also some kind of elder...
:{{DIcon}} He definitely seems pretty important...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 05.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' No, he's an assistant at [[Ifa]]'s clinic, and one of my friends. His name is [[Cacucu]].
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 07.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' The heck are you on about?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Is that not his name?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 08.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Oh wow... No way, bro!
:{{DIcon}} Seems like he's just repeating a few sentences over and over...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 06.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Yeah, that's what he does. Those are all Ifa's catchphrases, so Cacucu picked them up after hearing them day after day.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 07.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' The last time I delivered some vegetables to the People of the Springs, I ran into Ajaw, who was there for a soak in the hot springs. Ajaw and Cacucu were stuck in an endless back-and-forth argument.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like a schoolyard squabble...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 08.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Eventually, Ajaw got really agitated, and just started immediately shouting "No, YOU!" no matter what Cacucu said!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' How unbelievably childish... No less than I'd expect of Ajaw. Even I have rarely witnessed things like that.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 09.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' They went on like that for an entire afternoon.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, how do you know that? Did you stay and listen to them the whole time?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 10.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Yeah, I did. It was so dumb, I couldn't look away.
:{{DIcon}} You're a more patient man than most...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 11.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Anyway... I'm here because I'm trying to capture Xbalanque.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "Capture," huh? A... wild choice of words.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 12.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Hmm... then how about, "hunting for Xbalanque"?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry, you're trying to do WHAT, now?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 13.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' We've never seen someone so ancient come back to life before, right? So I wanted to see if I could intercept him. See? This is the trap that I made.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 14.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I've used it before. It's quite good at catching wild animals. Don't worry, though &mdash; I've already told everyone that there's a trap here, so they won't get too close.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 15.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' See? I even made a notice board.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 09.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Hahaha!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pff, good luck catching anyone with this... And what are you planning on doing with the poor guy when you catch him, anyway? Stick him in a stew?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 16.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' No, no, I just want to see what he looks like. And then... I'll probably invite him to our tribe as a guest.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'll admit, I didn't take you for the actively hospitable sort.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 17.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Well, a chance like this doesn't come every day. I wanted to give it a try, so I also made these little handicrafts.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Uhh... He says that, yet all of these look like a hunter's lethal handiwork...)
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I see. In that case, I wish you success. If you do manage to catch a wild Xbalanque, please let me know. I'd love to come and watch the fun.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, not you too!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If the real Xbalanque does show up, a trap like that won't hurt him. We all have faith in him. After all, he was the first Archon of this land.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 18.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' That's right. That's also why I stuffed several layers of cushions and hay in there. If he really triggers the trap, he can just sprawl out and take a nap.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 10.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' For real, now? Do you even hear yourself, bro?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bro, stop. You're driving Paimon insane over here...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 11.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Oh wow... No way, bro!
:{{DIcon}} No way, bro!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if you've got time for this, then you've finished prepping for the tournament, right?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You took the words right out of my mouth, Paimon.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 19.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Ah, so that's it. Sorry, I didn't know that's what you wanted to ask about.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 20.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' We of the Masters of the Night-Wind are broadly responsible for the woven scrolls and mental support. I have expertise in exactly neither of those, so... I joined the logistics team.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 21.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I provided some amazing supplies. The others even praised me for the quality of my produce, and even asked me about how to grow such great fruits and vegetables. I was very happy.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You've gotten quite good at dealing with people.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 22.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Yes. I think I've rediscovered a bit of that feeling I had in my childhood.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Seems like things here are going smoothly. In that case, we'll check on how things are going elsewhere. See you later, Ororon.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bye, Ororon! Good luck with, uh... capturing Xbalanque...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 12.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' See you later!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh, so he also knows how to say goodbye... See you later then, bros.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 olorun 23.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Huh? Hmm... Alright. See you later, my bros.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Huh? Mavuika? Oh, shoot. What are you doing here...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' [[Xilonen]]? What a coincidence.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, hey there, Xilonen! Did you come here for work?
:{{DIcon}} There's nothing around here, though...
:{{DIcon}} Other than Ororon and his trap, I mean...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Ororon... Did he sell me out? I thought I asked him to not tell anyone that I was here...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, he didn't mention you at all!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Tch... That so.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' *sigh* she's avoiding me. There are a few big pieces of equipment we need for the tournament, and I've been wanting to ask her to make them.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I went straight to her place because I was worried she might refuse, but each time, there was nobody home, and the neighbors said that she was busy... turns out she was here.
:{{DIcon}} Xilonen's tent is nearby too...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, she literally ran away from home just to avoid taking work from you!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hrmm...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Okay, that's enough about me... What are you here for? Checking on Pilgrimage prep progress?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes, and to see how everyone's doing while we're at it. Still, most everyone we've talked to so far has been pretty interested in Xbalanque.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Xbalanque? Did you just say Xbalanque?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, have you been so busy running away that you missed the whole memo about him?
:{{Black Screen|You explain Xbalanque's imminent resurrection to Xilonen...}}
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'm still trying to wrap my head around it... But if that's what Citlali said, then it has to be true.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Everyone's reactions make sense, too. Who wouldn't want to see the first Archon?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' This isn't a bad time for it to happen, either. The war has only just ended, and with their long-standing goal suddenly gone, people are feeling a little lost.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I met a warrior from the People of the Springs near the Speaker's Chamber a few days ago. He spent the entire afternoon pacing around the area.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I asked him if anything was bothering him, and he said that he used to train for battle every afternoon. But now that the crisis is resolved, he doesn't know what to do with himself.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon can definitely see that... It's tough when what you've been doing all along suddenly stops being necessary.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's why you want to hold the Pilgrimage again, right? To help everyone find a new goal.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right. We will have competition take the place of ceaseless battle. It will give us an outlet for our pent-up energy, and offer a reward for the blood and sweat we've put into improving and growing.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's the meaning of the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame today and in the future.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Sounds pretty good to me. I am starting to like this new Pilgrimage already.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But how do you feel, Mavuika?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' About Xbalanque, you mean? Meh, it's okay, I guess.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Shouldn't you be, you know, a little more nervous? He's our nation's progenitor. You sure he's not coming just to supervise your work?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ah, you sound like someone who's finally gotten the chance to strike back after years of oppression.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hey, don't put it like that... Alright, maybe a little. It's not every day that someone who could bring you down a notch shows up.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hahaha, I knew that's what you'd think. Don't worry. If the real Xbalanque does make an appearance, then naturally, I have my ways to meet him.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? How?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No spoilers just yet. Take a guess.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you have a playful side, too?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Of course she does. This whole "glorious, righteous leader" thing is just one facet of her, and it's the side of her you've seen the most so far. But...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Tragically, this is how my long-time companions think of me. Xilonen's always saying how awful I am.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hey, hey! Don't just put words into my mouth like that. I've only ever said that you can be quite terrible "sometimes."
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Sure, sure, whatever you say. Come on, {{Traveler}}, Paimon, let's head to our next stop.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh, and Xilonen, now that you've been busted, be sure to stop by my office and pick up the documents I left for you. I wrote down everything you need to do for the tournament.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Good night! *snores*
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aaaaaand she's "fallen asleep," just like that...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, she's got to wake up eventually. Let's go. Good night, Xilonen, and sleep well.

;(Talk to Xilonen again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Stop looking, I'm genuinely asleep now...

;(Talk to Ororon again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' What is it? Do you want to talk about something else?
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Hmm, you've got to find someone who understands [[Saurian]]-tongue to translate for you, then.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 cacucu 01.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' No way, bro!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq001 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Or... transform into a Saurian so they can talk to you. On that note, I'd love to try that one day, bro.

;(Talk to Cacucu while [[indwelling]] a Saurian, optional)
:'''Cacucu:''' Hey hey, hello there!
:{{DIcon}} Hello. You're Cacucu, right?
:'''Cacucu:''' Oh! So you already know my name. That guy told you, didn't he? Ororon, right?
:'''Cacucu:''' Hahaha, he spoke the truth. My name is indeed Cacucu, and I did pick those words up from hearing Ifa repeat them.
:'''Cacucu:''' And have you met Ifa before?
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
:{{DIcon}} Next time, for sure.
:'''Cacucu:''' What, even with all his running around and being everywhere all at once all the time, you've never met him? Guess you must be in tip-top shape, so you've just never needed his services.
:'''Cacucu:''' He's out to see some patients, and I had nothing to do, so I came to hang out with Ororon and watch him make his Xbalanque-trap. Absurd, right? He's so crazy, I love him.
:'''Cacucu:''' Ifa. Ah, right, speaking of Ifa, I need to correct you on one thing.
:'''Cacucu:''' Judging from how you reacted before... Did you think I couldn't really understand the human language?
:'''Cacucu:''' C'mon, bro, of course that's not true! Hehe! As Saurians go, I already understand more than enough! And not just their words, no, but their body language, too.
:'''Cacucu:''' There's a limit to how much I can mimic with my vocal cords &mdash; mighty shame, that &mdash; but I feel like my cadence should convey my meaning well enough.
:'''Cacucu:''' So of course I understand what "No way, bro! Do you even hear yourself?" means &mdash; and all the rest of it too. I meant those words from the bottom of my heart.
:'''Cacucu:''' Also, I'm no pet, I'm Ifa's colleague! Be a good bro, and call me Dr. Cacucu.
:{{DIcon}} You got it, Brocucu.
:'''Cacucu:''' Hehehe, I like you! Chose the "bro" part over the "doc" part, eh? Well, if you'll be my bro, I'll gladly be yours too.
:'''Cacucu:''' Ifa and Ororon are both my bros, and now, I've found a third bro. You look like a real fighter, too. Just what the doctor ordered.
:'''Cacucu:''' Oh, and I guess Ajaw counts for like, half a bro. You know, that useless guy who works for Kinich from the Scions of the Canopy. Ahahaha, he's a funny one. Often chokes half to death on his anger after just a few words.
:{{DIcon}} He often calls himself the "Almighty Dragonlord"...
:'''Cacucu:''' Hah! Sorry, what? "Almighty Dragonlord"? Bwahahahahahaha!
:'''Cacucu:''' Bro, don't believe a single word he says. He's just an idiot. He'd have gotten himself killed long ago if Kinich wasn't looking out for him!
:'''Cacucu:''' Still, don't you think that's what gives life its spice? No matter how much Ajaw whines, he can't leave Kinich. And Ifa can complain all he wants, but Ororon's still his friend.
:'''Cacucu:''' Oh, and me, too. Ifa often says I'm too familiar with everyone &mdash; that I instantly fly off and tell all of my Saurian friends whenever he does something dumb. But that's just how we live, man. We torment and depend on each other in turns.
:'''Cacucu:''' Once we Saurians know, the humans will know, too. And whatever humans know, the humans from further away will know real soon.
:'''Cacucu:''' Still, I know you'll love Ifa, bro. He's a good guy, after all. Have you ever met a bad guy who's like, resigned all the time?
:'''Cacucu:''' Anyway, if you ever need a doc, or just someone to help you translate our tongue, come find me anytime. I'll send my boy Ifa to go help right away.
:'''Cacucu:''' Oh oops, I meant "my bro Ifa." Of course I'd slip up. He's not a boy, you hear? He's my bro.

:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Of course, without a doubt. I'll be honest, I'm more concerned about how everyone's doing than how the preparations are coming along.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The amount of rest they get will directly impact their tournament performance. It's my hope that everyone is eating and sleeping well, so they can enter the Stadium full of anticipation.

:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I take it that means there haven't been many fights?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yeah, the war has just ended, and the bonds between people have grown a lot stronger in the process... Hard to start fights like that.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 6 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I don't mind, though. More time for me to zone out. I just sit at a lookout point and tend to my weapons... The fresh air is also great for my mood.

:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 tribepeoplec 02.ogg}} '''Flower-Feather Clan Tribesperson:''' What brings you to the Flower-Feather Clan? Are you here to check on our work for the Pilgrimage?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right. Everything going well?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 tribepeoplec 03.ogg}} '''Flower-Feather Clan Tribesperson:''' Please rest assured, everything's going off without a hitch. Everyone is in good spirits as well. Coach and her students are also here, so they've been helping out.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Coach? Oh, is [[Iansan]] here too?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oho, here to inspect our handiwork, then?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Lots of folks from the Flower-Feather Clan have gone to train for the tournament, and my students just so happened to want to get some exercise, so I brought them along to help.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' The rules of this tournament are different from before &mdash; we're here to compete, not to select the strongest warriors. Everyone finds that quite novel, and is taking it very seriously, treating it like a completely new type of challenge.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Look, they're all over there.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 together 01.ogg}} '''Flower-Feather Clan Tribespeople:''' Hey!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 yopia 02.ogg}} '''Yopia:''' Please rest completely and totally assured that with us here, we'll get all the tasks done on time, no problem and no questions asked.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, they're all so reliable! Like Coach, like student, huh, Iansan?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Haha, you flatter me. We're just here to help.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' These exercises are high-frequency but low-intensity, which is perfect for our training. I helped Ifa bring a whole stack of medical supplies from his clinic to the Stadium yesterday. Didn't even break a sweat, easy-peasy.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Didn't even break a sweat, you say?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yeah. Ifa was sure sweating a lot, though. Not that I blame him &mdash; doctors don't need to be that physically strong, not even vets.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Especially not compared to the toughest coach in all Natlan.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Tough, they say? Stuff like this isn't even intermediate level...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' And that's why they call you tough. I respect it, though. I doubt I can think of anything that you can't do.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon agrees! In fact, after staying in Natlan for so long, even we've begun to feel like there's nothing we can't do...
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' So, you think it's something about this place?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, exactly! Now, Paimon often finds herself thinking, "Eh, compared to those super tough battles we fought and won, this is nothing at all!"
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'm glad you feel that way. It's not often that people can focus on the silver lining after everything that's happened.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 09.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Being optimistic also tends to make people grow happier the longer they live. Keep up that attitude, and you'll go from strength to strength.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hmm... The wind is rising. I think I hear something on the air.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I'll head out on a patrol. Have a nice chat, and just let me know if you need anything.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 10.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Sounds good. See you later!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 11.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' And she's off... She really comes and goes like the wind.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'd say that it's effortlessly cool moments like this that make her so endearing.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 12.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Well, what's next for you? You three look relaxed, so I assume you're pretty much done with all the important stuff?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We've already checked up on each of the tribes' progress. Everything is going smoothly.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We didn't quite get around to the Children of Echoes, but from what Kachina says, and seeing how Xilonen's doing, it seems they're fine. No need to check up on them.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 19.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Don't worry, things have been progressing over at the [[Collective of Plenty]] too.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, um... that's it for the day. The only thing left to do for the next couple of days is... persuade Xilonen to finish her part of the work.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 13.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Haha, oh, I'd love to see the face she'd make if she heard you say that.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 14.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Since you have time, why don't you give me a hand? As you already know, Mavuika, I'm responsible for designing the tournament course.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 15.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Well, it's almost complete, and I've built a mock course. Want to do a trial run?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so you mean... we can get a sneak peek at what the competition will be like!?
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 16.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Indeed. You know that Mavuika can't personally participate in the tournament, right? As the Archon, she must serve as both host and judge.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 17.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' And as special supervisors, you can't sign up, either. So, this is your best chance to experience the course!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Say no more, or my hair might spontaneously combust... Come on, just show us the course already.
:{{A|vo mwklq001 7 iansan 18.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Alright, follow me.
