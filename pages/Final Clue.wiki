{{Description|Secrets from [[Diluc]]'s past continue to be unveiled while the [[Knights of Favonius|knights of Ordo Favonius]] have an ultimatum to catch the [[Collei|culprit]] behind the Black Fire Incident before they strike again. Will they manage to do it on time?}}
'''Final Clue''' is Chapter 8 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
Collei accidentally reveals to the knights that [[Crepus]]' [[Delusion#Crepus' Delusion|Delusion]] backfired on him, raising [[Kaeya]]'s suspicions. [[Amber]] adds that she remembers a time when she hid in a closet at the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters]] as a child to scare [[Amber's Grandfather|her grandfather]]. However, he didn't show up and other people used the office that day. She overhears former inspector [[Eroch]], who tells Diluc to cover up the incident in order to maintain the Knights of Favonius' reputation. Angered, Diluc quits the organization permanently.

As Kaeya inspects the papers, Collei asks him about its writing. He gleefully asks about her sudden interest in the documents before Amber pushes him away. Unfortunately, none of them including [[Lisa]], can read the writing. Lisa decides to send a request to [[Cyrus (Sumeru)|someone]] from [[Sumeru Akademiya]] for assistance.

At the Knights of Favonius Headquarters, Collei and the knights continue further investigation into the incident and decide to search for the culprit behind it before the [[Fatui]] arrive in three days. Kaeya offers to find the culprit on his own while [[Jean]] gives Amber an alternative assignment.
