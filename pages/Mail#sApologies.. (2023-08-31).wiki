|text      = I have been so busy with divination recently that I lost track of time and couldn't tell if it was day or night! I almost forgot which day of the week it was. Fortunately, the Editor-in-Chief of my column "All Things Astrological" sent a letter reminding me that the deadline for my latest manuscript was just around the corner.

Truly, when it rains it pours... I fear that I no longer have time to go out and celebrate my birthday.

But no matter what, today is an important day, and at the very least I must not short-change my precious friends.

Attached to this letter is a gift. It is the "Rainbow Rose" that the editor mentioned, and I hear this kind of flower is quite popular in Fontaine, so it is perfect for a gift.

And if you are willing, you can wish for me to finish my manuscript early. And the next time we meet, you can treat me to a bit of cake.
