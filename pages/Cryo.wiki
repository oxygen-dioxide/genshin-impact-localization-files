'''Cryo''' is one of the seven [[Elements]].

Its associated [[Archon]] is the [[Tsaritsa]], whose domain is [[Snezhnaya]].

==Elemental Resonance==
Having two Cryo characters in the group results in the [[Elemental Resonance]]:
*'''Shattering Ice:''' Affected by Electro for 40% less time. Increases CRIT Rate against enemies that are Frozen or affected by Cryo by 15%.

==Elemental Reactions==
{{Cryo}} has the following [[Elemental Reactions]]:
*{{Icon/Element|Electro}} '''[[Superconduct]]:''' Deals {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} and reduces the {{Color|Physical RES}} of enemies caught in the AoE by 40%.
*{{Icon/Element|Hydro}} '''[[Frozen]]:''' Immobilizes the target and applies a Freeze aura.
** {{Icon/Element|Geo}}{{Element|Physical|link=Blunt Attack}} '''Shatter:''' If the Frozen target is hit by a [[Blunt Attack|Blunt]] or {{Geo}} attack, deals {{Color|Physical DMG}} and unfreezes the target.
*{{Icon/Element|Pyro}} '''[[Melt]]:''' Deals ×1.5 {{Color|Cryo DMG}} when a Cryo attack triggers the reaction.
*{{Icon/Element|Anemo}} '''[[Swirl]]:''' Deals {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} while spreading the Cryo status to nearby enemies.
*{{Icon/Element|Geo}} '''[[Crystallize]]:''' Creates a Cryo shield.

==Cryo Status==
{{Cryo}} is a status effect that reduces overall character speed. While affected by the {{Cryo}} status, all animation speed will decrease by 15%. This animation speed decrease stacks multiplicatively with [[Attack Speed]] and [[Movement Speed]]. This is not to be confused with [[Sheer Cold]], an environmental mechanic that is the result of the [[Subzero Climate]].

Unlike other elements, the Cryo status can also be applied to certain objects, such as [[Geo Constructs#Exploration|Ores]], [[Thunderwood]]s, [[Thunder Dwelling]]s, and [[Amber]]'s [[Explosive Puppet|Baron Bunny]], and can allow certain elemental reactions to occur on such objects.

==Sibling Elements==
[[File:Cryo Frozen Comparison.png|thumb|Comparison between the Cryo status icon (left) and the Frozen/Freeze status icon (right)]]
{{Cryo}} has 2 sibling elements, '''Frozen''' and '''Freeze'''. The status icon for the Freeze/Frozen auras is similar to that of the Cryo status, but with an animated glow around it.

Cryo, Frozen, and Freeze auras can all coexist on the same target.

===Frozen===
The '''Frozen''' element functions similarly to Cryo, but with the following differences:
* It does not react with {{Hydro}}.
* It does not apply the animation speed debuff.
* The Frozen [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge]] can be depleted by [[Poise Damage]] from [[Blunt Attack]]s.

The Frozen element can be applied in several ways:
* Applied to enemies with a Frozen [[shield]].
** All "Cryo" shields used by enemies are actually of the Frozen element, as indicated by the status icon.
* Applied to certain enemies as innate auras, such as [[Cryo Slime]]s and the [[Cryo Hypostasis]].
* Applied to characters with certain [[Talents]].

===Freeze===
The '''Freeze''' element is applied when a [[Frozen]] reaction is triggered and maintains the Frozen state while it is present. Like the Frozen aura, the Freeze aura cannot react with {{Hydro}}. When a target with the Freeze aura is hit by a [[Blunt Attack|Blunt]] or [[Geo]] attack, [[Shattered]] will be triggered.

===Frozen Status to Self===
The following [[Talents]] apply {{Color|Cryo|Frozen}} to its user and/or the active character.

==Trivia==
=== Etymology===
*The name Cryo comes from the prefix for words related to freezing or ice, "{{wt|cryo-|cryo-|English}}," which derives from {{lang|the Ancient Greek word for icy cold, frost, chill|grc=κρύος|grc_rm=krúos}}.
