The '''Crumpled Namelist''' is a list originally found inside [[Jeht]]'s tent in the [[Tanit Camps]]. It consists of names of members of the [[Tanit]] tribe. From the context of the conversations that Jeht has with the [[Traveler]] and [[Babel]] in the ''[[For Her Judgment Reaches to the Skies...]]'' [[World Quest]], it can be inferred that it is a "hit list" of people Babel ordered Jeht to assassinate. After Jeht leaves the Tanit, the list disappears from her tent, and can be found again in a tent in the canyon past [[Liloupar's Cell]], below [[Wadi Al-Majuj]]'s western [[Teleport Waypoint]].
