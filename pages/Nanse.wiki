{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nanse:''' Hmm? Need some treatment, or looking to get something patched up?
:'''Nanse:''' It's not that I wouldn't be able to, but I'm almost out of medicine right now.
:{{DIcon}} You're a doctor?
::'''Nanse:''' That's right, something wrong with that? Most of the Masters of the Night-Wind you'll bump into on the road will be doctors rushing somewhere for a house call.
::'''Nanse:''' Unfortunately, I just finished an emergency visit, so I'm quite exhausted, and running low on medicine too.
::'''Nanse:''' ...How about this &mdash; if you really do need help, you can try your luck and see if you can find a [[Ororon|young man wearing a hood out]] there in the wild.
::'''Nanse:''' He might sound a tad eccentric when he gets talking, but he's a good person, and I'm sure he'll help you.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Got it.
:::'''Nanse:''' Aye. Speaking of which, I can't use all the mushrooms he gave me before, so I've still got some left... Take these, please. They're quality.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Candlecap Mushroom|x=3}}
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I'm fine.
::'''Nanse:''' Ohh, well that's alright then.
