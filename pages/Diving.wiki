'''Diving''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Fontaine]] that requires the blessing of the Transoceanic Sourcewater, unlocked after touching the first [[Statue of The Seven]] in Fontaine. It allows players to explore the waters underneath mainland [[Fontaine]] except around the [[Nostoi Region]] and prevents them from [[Fallen Character#Out of Bounds and Drowning|drowning]].

==Overview==
While diving, all characters have the same abilities, and the player is able to switch between different members of the [[party]]. Aquatic Stamina is used instead of [[Stamina]] while sprinting and cannot be further unlocked or increased.

[[Fontemer Aberrant]]s and specialized [[Clockwork Meka]] can be found while diving in Fontaine's waters. Rather than being able to attack them with their own weapons and skills, the player's characters instead use a water string that replaces their Normal Attack and a special skill that can be acquired by attacking a [[Xenochromatic Creature]] which replaces their Elemental Skill. The damage of a single type of underwater ability is the same across all characters regardless of level, equipment, and stats. Some underwater abilities may deal more damage than others, with some being able to break rocks and crystal ores and dealing more [[poise]] damage.

The Transoceanic Sourcewater takes the form of a small blue bubble floating near the active character's right shoulder. When a Xenochromatic Creature Ability is held, the bubble center changes to display its icon. If the character has an [[Arkhe]] alignment, the bubble will be surrounded by its corresponding aura. The ability will be held if the player transfers from one underwater point to another.

[[Recovery Orb]]s are found underwater near schools of fish and are used to restore Aquatic Stamina and [[HP]] for the entire party. Underwater currents can help the player explore and cross greater distances more quickly.

When exiting the water while diving, characters will slowly resurface. If sprinting while exiting the water, [[Fontaine|Fontainian]] characters and the [[Traveler]] will leap out of the water. Those characters can resume diving immediately if the leap is not vertical and the player holds the directional inputs during the water re-entering animation. Otherwise, they will exit Diving and turn to regular [[Swimming]] mode.
