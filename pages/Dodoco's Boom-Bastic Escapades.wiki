{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 1.png
|text1  = The stage details will include information on the stage environment, types of Spikey Fish you might encounter, buffs, and other things. Carefully check those details to help Dodoco defeat the Spikey Fish more effectively!
|image2 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 2.png
|text2  = Shoom-Shoom Shoes, Boom-Boom Bandoliers, and Crash-Clang Canisters are the three buff types that Dodoco can pick up. They boost Movement SPD, maximum bomb capacity, and explosion AoE. These buffs {{Color|BP|are hidden amidst the Steady-State Seagrass}}. Additionally, Dodoco's improved {{Color|BP|attributes can be viewed in the status bar on the right}}.
|image3 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 3.png
|text3  = Dodoco will lose Vitality when {{Color|BP|attacked by Spikey Fish}} or {{Color|BP|when hit by explosions}}. Losing Vitality will grant a temporary immunity to damage. Pick up Lil' Bandages to restore Vitality.
|image4 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 4.png
|text4  = {{Color|BP|Defeat all the Spikey Fish}} to achieve victory.
|image5 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 5.png

|image6 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 6.png

|image7 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 7.png
|text7  = Mighty Spikey Fish Warriors wearing armor of unknown origin... or perhaps simply made from underwater detritus. {{Color|BP|You can deal DMG to them after destroying their armor}}. If they run into Dodoco during their patrol, they will deal DMG to Dodoco.
|image8 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 8.png
|text8  = After obtaining Hollow Charge, Dodoco's bombs will be upgraded to Self-Forged Warheads, gaining the ability to {{Color|BP|penetrate Seagrass and opponents}}, dealing DMG to all opponents within the explosion AoE. Additionally, Self-Forged Warheads created via the Hollow Charge upgrade will allow Dodoco to directly{{Color|BP| penetrate armor and deal DMG to Armored Spikey Fish}}.
|image9 = Tutorial Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades 9.png
|text9  = These Spikey Fish Warriors might have no spikes, but they're still prickly characters. They are also explosives enthusiasts who will never stop {{Color|BP|deploying Bubble Bombs}}. Bubble Bombs will {{Color|BP|deal DMG to Dodoco}} and can {{Color|BP|ignite bombs that Dodoco has placed}}. Additionally, Bubble Bombs will not damage Spikey Fish Warriors or Seagrass.

===I - The Magic Trick of Multiple Kabooms===
[[File:Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades Stage 1.png|200px|thumb|right]]
{{Description|Once upon a fairly recent time, a big band of bad Spikey Fish invaded Cider Lake, only to be driven away by the valiant Dodoco, who sent them scarpering with their tails between their fins...<br>But after licking their wounds and gathering reinforcements, the Spikey Fish are back with a vengeance, making waves with their return!<br>Fortunately, after a crash course with the Spark Knight, Dodoco has mastered a new skill &mdash; deploying bombs on the move! Even though the Spikey Fish have the advantage in numbers, our nimble Dodoco need fear not!}}
{{Description|Bombs are dangerous for both Dodoco and Spikey Fish, so stay safe and take cover promptly! Once you understand how bombs work, you too, can accomplish the feat of "Dodocos Don't Look at Explosions."}}

===II - One Charge of Propellant Ain't Enough to Solve Things===
[[File:Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades Stage 2.png|200px|thumb|right]]
{{Description|This time, the Spikey Fish are more cunning than ever. Not only will they swim around to avoid explosions, but they've also switched to a wide formation to avoid being wiped out by a single bomb!<br>However, Dodoco's Special Jumpy Dumpties have also been upgraded &mdash; if a single bomb's worth of explosives isn't enough to deal with those pesky fish, then surely double the charge will do the trick! As long as the fireball's big enough, they'll have nowhere to hide!<br>That being said though, when using double-charged bombs, Dodoco must be extra, extra careful...}}
{{Description|Explosions that can penetrate Seagrass not only leave enemies with nowhere to hide but also expand Dodoco's own danger zone. Be very careful and "don't stay in the trajectory of an armor-piercing munition~"}}

[[File:Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades Stage 3.png|200px|thumb|right]]
{{Description|Some of the Spikey Fishes' reinforcements are specialized sprinters &mdash; fleet-of-fin and smug to the brim, they think they're the most agile, uncatchable, unbeatable characters in the whole of the underwater kingdom...<br>Unfortunately for them, they're about to have a very, very nasty shock. Though they might think themselves quick, when it comes to speed, Dodoco's bombs are in a whole other league! If the latter was a diving bird, those little fishies would barely be faster than a falling dandelion seed in comparison &mdash; which, on a windless day, falls at a rate of about five feather-widths per second... In other words, as long as Dodoco gets the direction right, they don't stand a chance!}}
{{Description|When the eager Spikey Fish rush over, Dodoco can either turn and flee or drop a bomb to make the opponent collide head-on... with a wall of shrapnel and flames!}}

[[File:Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades Stage 4.png|200px|thumb|right]]
{{Description|"If we can't dodge their bombs, we'll just have to wear thicker armor to withstand the blast!"<br>Some of the Spikey Fish, having given up on trying to outswim Dodoco's bombs, have gone all-in on brute strength. This time, they've decided to clad themselves in heavy armor and adopt a strategy of blindly rampaging about...<br>Unfortunately, their craftsmanship was so poor that it would make even the worst blacksmiths in the history of Mondstadt cringe in shame... After just a few explosions, the screws holding their armor together get blown completely away, and even the armor itself starts cracking and breaking apart. Long story short, Dodoco has nothing to fear!}}

===V - You Can Keep the Bomb As a Gift===
[[File:Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades Stage 5.png|200px|thumb|right]]
{{Description|If fire can be fought with fire, then surely magic can with magic, and bombs with bombs... Some of the brighter sparks among the Spikey Fish seem to have had a very, very cunning plan. Seeing Dodoco's bombs as gifts, they studied them carefully in their fishy hideouts, biding their time while they devised a secret weapon of their own...<br>But as the villains of this story, they proved to be no more than half-baked explosives enthusiasts, for their bombly affections were neither sufficiently pure nor amply ardent! Naturally, when the formula is so lacking in sincerity and passion, the power of the explosives takes a dramatic nosedive as a result. Even if you offered some of these to Dodoco for free, she wouldn't accept them...}}
{{Description|After Bomb Spikey Fish appear, bombs that have already been lit may not obey Dodoco's commands. Therefore, we need to think carefully about when and where to place the bombs...}}

Under the Spark Knight's wise guidance, she has mastered the art of target allocation, skillfully directing her firepower to fight off large swarms of troublemaking "swim"-pletons. The inevitable outcome for the bad Spikey Fish is, you guessed it, yet another humiliating defeat...}}
