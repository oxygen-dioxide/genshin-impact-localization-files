:'''Arakavi:''' Golden Nara and [[Arama]] defeated Marana, and brought new story and new song with the Ashvattha...
:{{DIcon}} About the Ashvattha...
::'''Arakavi:''' A long, long time later, there will definitely be new Nara friends coming to Vanarana.
::'''Arakavi:''' But the future Nara will not have to go to the Ashvattha to look for the melodies of today.
::'''Arakavi:''' Because all Aranara and the leaves and soil of Vana will remember this Festival Utsava, remember the golden song.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} The song from Festival Utsava...
::'''Arakavi:''' It was a song as golden as the sun, and I was proud to be a part of it. As the Golden Nara, you will always stay in my memories and the memory of Vanarana.
::'''Arakavi:''' I'll leave the little one to you. This is the Singing Majalis, and she loves being surrounded by warm sounds. In the past, she was the emblem of us Song Gatherers. Flowers like her have all perished during Vanarana's destruction, and now, only one seed remains.
::'''Arakavi:''' We did not think that this seed would {{sic|never<!--should be "ever"-->}} grow or bloom again... But I think that the song from Festival Utsava gave her a new lease on life. Please, take her with you and give her lots of warmth and light.
