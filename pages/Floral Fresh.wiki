'''Floral Fresh''' is a repeatable daily [[commission]] in [[Mondstadt]].

==Steps==
# Talk to [[Flora]]
# Head to Dragonspine's [[Statue of The Seven]] and place a package there
# Head to Dragonspine and place a package beside a body of water
#* The body of water is west of the [[Starglow Cavern]] teleport waypoint.
# Head to the mountain cavern on Dragonspine and place a package there
#* This is directly below the Starglow Cavern teleport waypoint.
# Defeat all opponents
# Place a package near the mountain cave
# Report back to Flora
* If the player melts any of the flowers:
*# Apologize to Flora

==Notes==
* This commission directly relates to commission [[Fresh Flora]], following the completion of this commission. Flora will later have the player retrieve the flower packages from Dragonspine.
*After placing down each packet of flowers a small pile of ice will appear. Melting any one of them will lead to a different outcome.
* Enemies at the cavern:
**{{Enemy List|Ice Shieldwall Mitachurl;Ice Shield Hilichurl Guard*3|**}}
* These enemies do not drop items, Mora, or experience, and they have lower levels than regular Commission enemies.

{{Quest Description|Flowers don't stay fresh for long. Flora, the owner of the [[Floral Whisper]], has been thinking of ways to preserve them better...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Flora)
:'''Flora:''' These flowers aren't looking so good, either. What a shame...
:{{DIcon}} Something the matter?
:'''Flora:''' Well, lots of people tend to buy single flowers to give as gifts, so I usually cut some flowers specifically for that purpose.
:'''Flora:''' But the flowers I trim don't stay fresh for long. If they don't sell out, they'll wilt...
:'''Flora:''' I've tried many methods in the past, but the flowers degrade by the end of the day all the same.
:'''Flora:''' I wonder if there's any way to preserver those flowers for longer...
:{{DIcon}} Preservation, you say...
::'''Flora:''' I've heard [[Sara]] from Good Hunter say they put unused ingredients in a cool place, or preserve them using blocks of ice...
::'''Flora:''' I've tried these methods too, but flowers stored using ice blocks always end up looking weird.
::'''Flora:''' They won't have withered, but I wouldn't call them fresh either... and either way, they wouldn't be presentable anymore...
:{{DIcon}} Best to sell them all on the day itself, then.
::'''Flora:''' That would be best. But there are always one or two flowers that don't get sold.
::'''Flora:''' I know it's only one or two, but I don't want to just let them wither away.
:'''Flora:''' I asked a lot of people, and Mr. [[Sayid]]... You know who he is, right? He's that researcher.
:'''Flora:''' One day, when he came to buy flowers, he told me that he once read about putting flowers in cold storage in a book.
:'''Flora:''' Specifically... it involves using a container to store the flowers before placing that container near blocks of ice...
:'''Flora:''' He also mentioned that if I wanted to do some experiments, the most suitable place would be the low-temperature environment on Dragonspine.
:'''Flora:''' But I've heard that Dragonspine's a very dangerous place, and I couldn't find any adventurers willing to help me on such short notice...
:'''Flora:''' Traveler, could you help me bury these three flower containers in the Dragonspine snow?
:{{DIcon}} Consider it done.
:{{DIcon}} Where should I bury them?
:'''Flora:''' Thanks for your help. Let me think... I've heard that Dragonspine is huge, and has a lot of different regions, which could lead to very different results...
:'''Flora:''' Perhaps a comparison might be in order...
:'''Flora:''' Alright, please help me place these flowers {{Color|buzzword|beside the Statue of The Seven}} and {{Color|buzzword|at the entrance of a cavern on the mountain}}.
:'''Flora:''' Then I'd like you to find an area {{Color|buzz|with water on the mountain}}. Either a lake or a pool will do &mdash; just bury it  by the water's edge.
:;(If you previously failed the quest)
::'''Flora:''' Please be very careful not to damage them this time.
;(Obtain [[Package of Fresh Flowers]] ×1)

;(Talk to Flora again)
:'''Flora:''' Mr. Sayid really knows a lot. I wonder, do people keep flowers at Sumeru Akademiya too?
----
;(Before burying first flower)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, guess we should bury that container in the snow near that Statue of The Seven.

;(After burying first flower)
:'''Paimon:''' Next up, let's head near a body of water...
:'''Paimon:''' How do we find water on a snowy mountain, though? Wouldn't it be ice by now?
----
;(After burying second flower)
:'''Paimon:''' Such a huge body of water. It doesn't make any sense...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's head for the cavern next... Sure hope that nothing weird lives in there...
----
;(Before burying third flower)
:'''Paimon:''' Eek, there ARE monsters here! Shouldn't have spoken so soon...

;(After burying third flower)
:'''Paimon:''' Guess that's the last one. Let's report back to Flora.
----
;(Talk to Flora after all flowers are buried)
:'''Flora:''' How are the flowers?
:{{DIcon}} Snugly underground.
:'''Flora:''' Thank you. We'll leave them there on the mountain for a while.
:'''Flora:''' Hehe, thanks so much for helping me out. Please, take these for your trouble.
----
;(If you melted any one of the ice piles)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Stop rummaging through the snow like that!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... The container and flowers are ruined.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, we're in trouble now... Best we go back and apologize to Flora...

;(Talk to Flora if any of the ice piles are melted)
:'''Flora:''' How are the flowers?
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry...
:'''Flora:''' Eh? What happened?
:{{DIcon}} I broke the containers and flowers by accident...
:'''Flora:''' B&mdash;By accident!?
:'''Flora:''' Ugh... I specifically picked those flowers out. You can't find such good flowers just anywhere...
:'''Flora:''' Is Dragonspine so dangerous that even an adventurer like you couldn't keep one container from...
:'''Flora:''' Still, thanks for making that trip for me. Please take these as thanks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go tend to my flowers.
:'''Flora:''' *sigh* Maybe I should try the method that Sara suggested after all...
