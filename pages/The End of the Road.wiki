{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the idol's location)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... The Abyssal corrosion seems super extreme here... Hey! That stone serpent...
:'''Paimon:''' Could this be the Secret Source Dragon Idol that [[Amaru]] told us about?

;(Interact with the idol)
:'''Secret Source Dragon Idol:''' (The Secret Source Dragon Idol that stands here... bears ancient signs of Abyssal corrosion...)
:'''Secret Source Dragon Idol:''' (Perhaps we should give it the permit and the replacement "energy"?)
:;(Submit {{Item|Permit to the Sacred Heart}} and {{Item|Phlogiston Unit|x=3}})
:'''Paimon:''' It... jumped right in.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Quest Description|Having obtained the permit, the time has arrived for you to activate the Secret Source Dragon Idol and enter the Heart of the Sacred Mountain.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(While falling though the hole)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! Down there... Is that the "Heart of the Sacred Mountain"?
:'''Paimon:''' It's kinda like a huge tear in the earth...

;(While falling further down though the hole)
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, it's a lot deeper than Paimon imagined...
:'''Paimon:''' And something about it is giving Paimon a really bad feeling...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Roawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, now it's your turn to try and make Paimon feel better, eh...

;(After falling though the hole)
:;(Quest completes)
