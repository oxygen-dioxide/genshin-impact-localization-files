;(Upon arriving at Wanwen Bookhouse)
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 jifang 01.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' So you'd like a copy of "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti"?
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 starsnatcher 01.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' Yes. Here, and keep the change.
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 jifang 02.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' Oh, aren't you generous? Thank you for your patronage!

:{{Color|action|After paying his debts, Starsnatcher departs...}}

:{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, isn't that, um... Starsnapper? What a coincidence, running into him again!
:{{DIcon}} It's Starsnatcher...
:{{DIcon}} Coincidence, or Adeptincidence?
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you hear the name of that book he just bought? Was it... "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti"?
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, well anyway, it was definitely a book about the adepti. Why would an adeptus wanna buy a book about himself?
:{{DIcon}} I always found him fishy...
::{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 04a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? What's so fishy about him?
::{{DIcon}} Why would an adeptus want people to pay him Mora?
:::{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 04a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, that's a good point... None of the other adepti we've met seemed like they needed anything from anyone.
::{{DIcon}} He's a charlatan, if you ask me.
:::{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 04b 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what you're trying to say is that he can't grant people's wishes?
::{{DIcon}} His mask is so ugly.
:::{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 04c.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's true, it really is. Very suspicious...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps he's a narcissist?
::{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 04b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could be!
::{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 04b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, but now that Paimon thinks about it, there's something that's just not right about this guy.
:;(Repeats first option branches)
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks we should check out that book. Maybe we'll find out something about this guy that we can use!

----

;(Asking Jifang about "Yakshas&#58; The Guardian Adepti")
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there. We'd like a copy of "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti" &mdash; do you have one in stock?
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 jifang 03.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' Huh. Since when did that old chestnut become a best-seller?
:{{A|vo xlq002 1 jifang 04.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' You're a rare breed of youngster if this is what you like to read... But you should be able to find a copy somewhere on that shelf over there.

----

;(After you find the book)
:{{A|vo xlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is the one! Let's see what it's about, shall we?

;(A [[#Cinematic|cinematic]] begins)
:'''[[Zhongli]]:''' In ancient times, Liyue was a land of misery, where the shadow of evil loomed large.<br />As slain gods festered, their vengeful wrath cursed the world, manifesting in infernal forms. When demons stirred, miasmas, monsters, and mutations infested the land.<br />Then, [[Rex Lapis]] summoned the [[yaksha]]s to vanquish the demons.<br />They swore an oath: "Restore order through slaughter, purge evil through battle, to this, we dedicate our lives."<br />Eons of bloodshed later, karmic debt weighed upon them, phantom wrath seeping into their broken souls. They went mad with fear, turned on each other, or succumbed to the darkness.<br />Of the five foremost yakshas, death came to three, while [[Bosacius|the fourth]] vanished without a trace.<br />In the millennia since, [[Xiao|one conqueror of demons]] remains the sole surviving yaksha in the mortal realm. And only on moonlit nights, in the glow from [[Guyun Stone Forest|Guyun]] and in the sound of [[Venti|the dihua flute]], is his memory preserved.
::{{Color|action|Tales of the yaksha have survived from ancient times to be recorded into books. In ancient Liyue, pestilience, demons, and anomalies could be found throughout the land, and each was the work of demons, the product of the lingering hatred and grudges that arose from the corpses of defeated gods.<br />The yaksha heeded the summons of Rex Lapis and cleansed these demons. In this long and brutal war, they became tainted by these lingering grudges and suffered greatly as a result, till at last only one Conqueror of Demons remained...}}
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Finished yet? Hehe, Paimon's already done.
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This book is about the yakshas, a group of adepti who defend Liyue.
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, seems like a pretty niche topic. Was there anything that stood out to you?
:{{DIcon}} About demons...
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The book says that the wrathful spirits of the gods defeated during the Archon War can sometimes cause plagues, monsters or mutations...
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All of which sound pretty horrendous. Hey, wait a second... Paimon wonders if...
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05a 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you think those super-evil hilichurls we saw earlier were the "mutations" that the book's talking about?
:{{DIcon}} About karma...
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The book says that the yakshas, after fighting against the wrath of the gods for thousands of years, became bound by karma.
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Poisoned by the hateful thoughts of the gods, the yakshas would often descend into indescribable fits of terror, rage, or agony...
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05b 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* It's so tragic... After everything they went through in all their years of protecting Liyue, they got no reward, and had to deal with so much suffering instead.
:{{DIcon}} About the sole surviving yaksha...
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05c 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, there used to be five main yakshas, but supposedly only one of them is still alive today.
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05c 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you think that it could have anything to do with that Starsnatcher guy?
::{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05c 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hm... No, surely not. He doesn't exactly give off the impression that he's been suffering for thousands of years...
:{{DIcon}} Nothing else that I can think of...
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 05d.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, Paimon thinks we've already summed up all the key points.
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, back to the matter at hand. The things we need answers on are one, where did those super evil-looking hilichurls came from, and two, what does Starsnatcher have to do with the yakshas. Right?
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now to head back to where this all started and commence our investigation! Let's part the fog of mystery that hangs over [[Jueyun Karst]], and let the truth shine through in its full glory!
:{{DIcon}} So we're playing detective now, are we?
:{{DIcon}} You're way too into this...
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ehehe! To be honest, Paimon actually hopes he is a real adeptus. Ah... His exorcism techniques seemed real enough, at least...
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, but if we get our hopes up, there's further for them to come down. So it makes sense to investigate thoroughly first, just to be sure!
:{{A|vo xlq002 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's head back to Wangshu Inn!

----

;(After returning to Wangshu Inn)
:{{A|vo xlq002 4 starsnatcher 01.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' Flee at my command, foul demon!
:{{A|vo xlq002 4 starsnatcher 02.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' ...Flee!
:{{A|vo xlq002 4 starsnatcher 03.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' Wh&mdash;Why won't you flee?!
:{{A|vo xlq002 4 hilichurls 01.ogg}} '''Hilichurl:''' Beru nye! Beru nya! Beru nyaaaa!!!
:{{A|vo xlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, looks like Starsnatcher's in trouble!
:{{A|vo xlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And there are innocent bystanders here, too. We have to step in!

----

;(Approach Starsnatcher after defeating the hilichurls)
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 starsnatcher 01.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' I don't get it... Why didn't the Sigil of Permission do anything?
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 starsnatcher 02.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' Has the evil aura of these hilichurls grown in intensity?
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Sigil of Permission]], huh? Now why does that sound familiar?
:{{DIcon}} Ah yes, the get out of Jueyun free card...
:{{DIcon}} So that's what he was using for his exorcisms...
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! It's a keepsake of the adepti, so it must still contain traces of their power!
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* No wonder he was able to scare those monsters away earlier...
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 starsnatcher 03.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:'''  Wh&mdash;What are you two babbling on about? One is merely underslept... meaning that one's adeptal power... is not in full flow!
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 starsnatcher 04.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' Were one but given another opportunity...
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well as it happens, there goes another bunch of evil hilichurls over there. Should we leave them to you, then?
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 starsnatcher 05.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' I&mdash;O&mdash;One... suddenly feels ill at ease. Surely one has overexpended one's adeptal powers, otherwise, one would surely purge these infernal beings at once...
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, so you WERE just bragging after all. We were right to be suspicious!
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, Traveler, looks like it's up to us. Use your [[Elemental Sight]] and hunt them down!

;(Talk to Starsnatcher again)
:{{A|vo xlq002 5 starsnatcher 06.ogg}} '''Starsnatcher:''' One is merely feeling unwell. One hopes that you shall not spread these tidings wantonly...

;(Talk to the follower on the left)
:{{A|vo dialog xlq002 malefollower 01.ogg}} '''Male Believer:''' It's not like the Master of Stars to fail an exorcism &mdash; perhaps he isn't feeling well today?

;(Talk to the follower in the middle)
:{{A|vo dialog xlq002 merchantfollower 01.ogg}} '''Mercantile Believer:''' I can't believe that the Master of Stars wasn't powerful enough to defeat those hilichurls...

;(Talk to the follower on the right)
:{{A|vo dialog xlq002 femalefollower 01.ogg}} '''Female Believer:'''  What happened there? Good thing we had you around, huh...
