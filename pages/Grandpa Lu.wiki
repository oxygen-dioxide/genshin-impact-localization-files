===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Grandpa Lu:''' The tea doesn't taste right.
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong with it?
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Hmm... I don't know how to describe it, but there's been something missing in the tea in our village recently.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' I don't know much about growing tea, but [[Uncle Luo|Luo]] has been worried sick. He's been running between the field and the warehouse, trying to find out what's happening. He's also been yelling at [[Jin]] quite a bit, poor guy...
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Well, it's almost time to make the tea offering to the [[Fujin|adeptus]], and the merchants are coming, too. Not a good time for us to have trouble with the tea...
::{{DIcon}} Um, those who drink it aren't going to get sick, right?
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' No, nothing like that. It's just lacking in flavor.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Even so, our tea leaves are still loads better than those you'll find in other places.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' But knowing Luo... He won't let anything below his standards enter the warehouse.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' He's going to be tea-wrangling for a couple of days.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Take it easy, alright? The passages in the mountains are treacherous, so be careful.

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing ''An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade'')
:'''Grandpa Lu:''' Greetings! Thanks to you, our water and soil can grow delicious tea again!
:{{DIcon}} You will be able to enjoy the tea, too.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Indeed! And good tea makes for a happy me, hahaha!
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' And I suppose Luo can finally get a good night's sleep...
:{{DIcon}} How has Uncle Luo been?
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Luo? He's been going down to the fields, making business deals, checking inventory... Basically, he's either sleeping or working.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' And he still takes it out on Jin all the time.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' I have to say, though, that while he might make mistakes from time to time, he's willing to learn, and that makes him a good egg. Luo can be mean sometimes, but he's training Jin as his successor in earnest.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' It's up to Jin himself whether he can stand Luo's temper or not.
:{{DIcon}} Please take care of yourself.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Don't worry about me. I'm doing great. I can probably stir-fry tea leaves for another ten years, at least.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' But you... Always working, rushing from one place to another. Do you even have time to drink water? Let alone tea...
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' The way I see it, you young people should be working hard, but not at the cost of your health.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Come see me in the village whenever you're free. I've got several compressed teabricks that have been aging for decades, and I haven't sold them, no matter what price was offered. When you come back next time, we'll drink from that stash! How about that?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Grandpa Lu:''' Leaving already? Alright, sure, but take care on those treacherous mountain roads!
