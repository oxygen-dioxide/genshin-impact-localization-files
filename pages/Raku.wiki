==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Raku is a Sangonomiya samurai who got a serious injury that is still recovering.

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Raku wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it.

:'''Raku''': *sigh* Old illnesses fester, and old wounds still ache...
:{{DIcon}} Are you hurt?
::'''Raku''': Well, what do you think? It was a pretty serious injury, too. It still hurts even now...
::'''Raku''': Hey, hey, stop peeking. My old wound looks awful. Why, the very sight of it might shock and disturb you... I'd advise against it.
::'''Raku''': Ow ow ow, that... really hurts.
::{{DIcon}} I can bring you to see a doctor.
::'''Raku''': Eh? Uh... There's no need, I went to see a doctor long ago. I mean, it's a serious injury. How could I have not gone to see a doctor, huh?
::'''Raku''': The doctor said that I needed to convalesce. That I needed a, ah, quiet environment and some time.
::'''Raku''': Anyway, don't you have better things to do? You look like a busy person. I'm sure you don't have time to waste here with me!
:{{DIcon}} Take care of yourself.
::'''Raku''': Oh, alright. Ow ow, it's hurting again...
