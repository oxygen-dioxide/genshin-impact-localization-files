{{Lang|'''Big G'''|zh=狼哥|zh_rm=Láng-gē}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Yet the Butterfly Flutters Away}}.

==Profile==
Big G was a childhood friend of [[Congzi]], [[Little Wu]], [[Mumu]], and [[Meng]]. They used to live in what once was a village in [[Wuwang Hill]], before Big G died in an unspecified accident. He was known by his friends for being acrophobic and having a terrible sense of direction, and he enjoyed extra-spicy [[Jueyun Chili Chicken]].

The so-called curse that [[Luocheng]] feared so much, was no more than Big G's presence while following him to [[Liyue Harbor]].

===Appearance===
Big G is the spirit of a young boy. He has gray hair and bangs with brown eyes and he wears a traditional Liyue outfit.
