'''Big G''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the [[Papilio Charontis Chapter]], Act I: [[Yet the Butterfly Flutters Away]].

==Profile==
Big G was a childhood friend of [[Congzi]], [[Little Wu]], [[Mumu]] and [[Meng]]. They used to live in what once was a village in [[Wuwang Hill]], before Big G died in an unspecified accident. He was known by his friends for being acrophobic and having a terrible sense of direction, and he enjoyed extra-spicy [[Jueyun Chili Chicken]].

The so-called curse that [[Luocheng]] feared so much, was no more than Big G's presence while following him to [[Liyue Harbor]].

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Big G is the spirit of a young boy. He has grey hair and bangs with brown eyes and he wears a traditional Liyue outfit.
