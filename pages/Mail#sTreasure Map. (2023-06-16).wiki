|text      = I recently came across a treasure map! It floated down from a tree, and a location most mysterious is drawn upon it: azure laying siege to a field of green, and the yellow of stone ornamented with viridian. Even I, a wandering bard who has nothing but free time to gallivant about, haven't got a clue just what kind of place it is. A seaside cave wreathed in clouds? A floating island covered in forest that appears only at night? Hm… just what is the answer?

Given that you're a brave hero who has voyaged across the land, why don't you have a look at it? Perhaps, with two hands on the scroll, we'll be at our destination in the blink of an eye! When that time comes, I'll leave the honor of finding the treasure to you!

As for me, well, I'll be happy to travel with you! Even if your journey takes you to the edge of the world, with me there, there's no need to worry. Though, if there's any danger, you'll remember to protect me, won't you?
