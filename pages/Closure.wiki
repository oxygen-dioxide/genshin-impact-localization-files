===The Truth Beyond the Truth===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 01.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...Hmph, hahaha... What was that word you used, "ally"? You think that someone as foolish as him is worthy to call himself my ally?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 02.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' They were worthless scum, all of them &mdash; not just Bernard and Pierre, but those Lefeveres, too! They always just saw me as a tool!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 03.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' I lost all my chances of a normal life just because I was born into their lot! Not only that, but because they wanted me to become an undercover agent, they stripped me of my name, too!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 04.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' I had to live in constant fear of them while they were alive, and even once they were gone, I had to continue to bury my heritage and my name... Always worrying that their enemies would come knocking at the door...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 05.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Do you know anything about what I've been through over all these years? My life as the last Lefervere!?
;(If Passive Check succeeds)
:;{{Color|Buzzword|(Insight Check Success)}} Elodie's expression seems a bit unnatural...
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (There's a hint of drama in the voice of the suddenly agitated Elodie. It feels like her anger may be part of some kind of bluff...)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I don't, and neither do I care.
:{{DIcon}} No one asked about your past.
:{{DIcon}} You can save that speech for the trial.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 06.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...Are, are you... Are you for real!? Aren't you a Lefevere victim, too!?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Elodie, you're the only one still living under the shadow of a name.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' That's enough! Keep your hands where I can see them and do not resist arrest! If you have more to say, save it for the interrogation room.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 07.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' What a joke... What a joke!! Hey! Don't come any closer!
:[[File:Closure Elodie's Device.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' What's that&mdash;
;(If Passive Check succeeds)
:;{{Color|Buzzword|(Perception Check Success)}} This device seems a bit odd...
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The small device that Elodie took out appears very crude, as if it's made from paper mache...)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 08.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Know what this is? Hahaha... I've secretly planted loads of explosives in the Humane Society! Just one step closer and...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 09.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Whether they're cats, dogs, or just unlucky human employees, they'll all be blown up into smithereens!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 10.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Surely, you bunch of goody two-shoes won't let that happen, right?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} [Persuasion] (Try to convince Elodie to surrender.)
:;(If the card drawn is less than 15)
:::{{DIcon}} Whoa, just calm down for a minute here...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 11.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' That's enough! I have nothing left to say to any of you! Gardemeks, get 'em!
:;(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 15)
:::{{DIcon}} It wasn't your choice to be born into a family of villains...
:::{{DIcon}} But that cannot justify your choice to also walk the path of evil.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 13.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' What do you understand about any of this!? I've suffered years of sleepless nights because of this name! I was sure that the moment I closed my eyes, someone seeking vengeance would descend upon me, calling for my blood...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 14.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...I finally found an opportunity to earn enough money to start a second life, and dump this name and all of its baggage onto Pierre...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 15.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' And you just had to go and ruin all of it!!!
:::{{DIcon}} If you choose to flee and go into exile now...
:::{{DIcon}} You'll only end up living under more fear and terror on your own.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 16.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' I... Ugh, then what am I supposed to do... Do I even have any choice!?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 17.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...Argh!
:::{{Black Screen|As Elodie's resolve begins to waver, she is knocked out by a hard blow from behind...}}
::;(Continue to next section)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} [Intimidation] (Help Chevreuse to intimidate Elodie.)
:;(If the card drawn is less than 15)
:::{{DIcon}} Whoa, just calm down for a minute here...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 11.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' That's enough! I have nothing left to say to any of you! Gardemeks, get 'em!
:;(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 15)
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Do you know what would happen to you if you were to run away now? The entire Special Patrol would be out hunting for you day and night to the ends of the world!
:::{{DIcon}} And all of Fontaine would know...
:::{{DIcon}} That a spawn of Lefevere still lives among them.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...Once word of that gets out, all the factions in Fontaine would be after you. But if you throw away the device now, I'll still count that as turning yourself in to the Gardes.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Would you rather go back with me now and wait for a trial, or wait for your enemies to find you, and subject you to the same interrogation techniques that your relatives were once infamous for?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 18.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' No... I... I can't...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 19.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...Argh!
:::{{Black Screen|As Elodie's resolve begins to waver, she is knocked out by a hard blow from behind...}}
::;(Continue to next section)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} [Deception] (Assist Lyney in deceiving Elodie.)
:;(If the card drawn is less than 15)
:::{{DIcon}} Whoa, just calm down for a minute here...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 11.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' That's enough! I have nothing left to say to any of you! Gardemeks, get 'em!
:;(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 15)
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...I can understand how you feel. Like you, we are also victims of the Lefevere clan.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But if you were to endanger innocents now for your own gain, the public anger towards the Lefeveres would only rise to a boiling point!
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And the families of the new victims would be dead set on exacting revenge on you.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 20.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Hmph... and what of it?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...I'll be your hostage, Elodie.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 21.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...What?
:::{{DIcon}} Don't do this, Lyney.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Thanks for your concern, {{Traveler}}... But we need to end all of the hate and violence arising from this clan once and for all.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...I'll raise my hands and come over slowly. I promise that I am completely unarmed.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 22.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...I'm watching you. Don't think for a second you can pull a fast one on me!
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Mhm, that's right... Just keep your eyes on me, don't look away...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 23.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...Argh!
:::{{Black Screen|As Elodie fixates her gaze on Lyney, she is struck by a hard blow from behind...}}
::;(Continue to next section)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} [Stealth] (Launch a sneak attack on Elodie while she's distracted.)
:;(If the card drawn is less than 15)
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 12.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Did you think I was blind? ...Tsk! Gardemeks, get 'em!
:;(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 15)
:::{{Black Screen|Without waiting for Elodie to finish her threats, you and Lynette strike as one...}}
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 24.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Ugh... What...!
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 elodie 25.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Hey! Don't do anything stupid... Gardes... Gardemeks&mdash;
:::{{Black Screen|Before Elodie can finish giving her command, she is subdued by you and Lynette after sneaking up on her from behind.}}
::;(Continue to next section)

;(While fighting the Gardemeks, if any dialogue check was failed)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918701 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Not good! She's trying to escape... We need to end this fight as soon as possible!

;(After defeating all Gardemeks)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 elodie 01.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' Busted so quickly, huh? Good thing I've already bought enough time to escape...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 elodie 02.ogg}} '''Elodie:''' ...Argh!
:{{Black Screen|As Elodie begins to believe that she may have finally made it, she is knocked out by a hard blow from behind...}}

:'''Bonnie:''' &mdash;Mrrow!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Phew... So I was right, after all. It's easier to deal with the person causing the problem than the problem itself.
:{{DIcon}} And what about that device she had?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' This is it... Looks like it's just a toy.
:{{DIcon}} (So, she really was just bluffing...)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Guess that's probably why she suddenly flipped and knocked out Bernard. He probably knew that there were no explosives at the Society.
:{{DIcon}} She also pretended like she had a villainous breakdown...
:{{DIcon}} As if she had no choice but to kill to escape her life.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Well, given that she never even showed her face to Bernard and Pierre, I had my doubts that she'd have gone to the Society in person to plant explosives.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thank you for your help, everyone. I'll take them back for thorough questioning, and find someone better to take over the Humane Society. I might need a few statements from everybody... Would you be able to come with me?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Er, if statements are all you need... Can Lyney provide them on my behalf?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I still need to go back and explain some things to the crew... I also had an appointment with {{Traveler}}, before we got interrupted.
:{{DIcon}} You mean... when you said I could stop by your place?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Ah, so you do remember. Yes, I invited you to come over to our place.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll make a nice cup of tea, and bring Bonnie to wait for you outside of my door.
::'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
:{{DIcon}} Oh... Seems I already forgot...
:;(-1 heart)
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' A lot has happened since then... I'm referring to when I invited you over for some tea and also to spend some time with Bonnie.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' {{tt|...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll make a nice cup of tea, and bring Bonnie to wait for you outside of my door.|Actual Voice Over: ...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll take Bonnie home and make a nice cup of tea. You'll be able to find us outside of my door.}}
::'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
:{{DIcon|TCG}} [Contemplation] What did she say again...
:;(If the card drawn is less than 10)

:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' A lot has happened since then... I'm referring to when I invited you over for some tea and also to spend some time with Bonnie.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' {{tt|...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll make a nice cup of tea, and bring Bonnie to wait for you outside of my door.|Actual Voice Over: ...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll take Bonnie home and make a nice cup of tea. You'll be able to find us outside of my door.}}
:::'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
:;(If the card drawn is greater than or equal to 10)
:::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I remember that when we parted ways at the Steambird yesterday, she mentioned something about having tea together at her place... But we were interrupted by Elodie and the others.)
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Ah, so you do remember. Yes, I invited you to come over to our place.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Once I'm done talking with the troupe, I'll make a nice cup of tea, and bring Bonnie to wait for you outside of my door.
:::'''Bonnie:''' Meow!

;(Talk to Lyney, optional)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Lynette must have spent a record-breaking amount of time in serious mode today. I can't remember the last time I've seen her like that... Could it be because of a special someone?
:{{DIcon}} There are still a few things I'm curious about...
:{{DIcon}} How did Pierre get recruited into the scheme?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm... Based on information that we found before, Imitation Sinthe was first circulated on a small scale in Fontaine, before becoming a large-scale smuggling scheme.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'd assume that the first offerings of Imitation Sinthe came from what Pierre made in his early days, but since he was not experienced with running a clandestine operation, he was soon discovered by Garde Elodie.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Elodie saw the opportunity to make a great profit in his work and perhaps even the chance of making a new life for herself, so she decided to cover his tracks...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' She started writing to him in Bernard's name, using what evidence she had compiled and the promise of enormous profits to blackmail him into cooperating with her.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Unfortunately for her, she ran into Lynette. Even though my sister doesn't like to focus too much on a regular day, "serious mode" Lynette is one of the most perceptive people I've ever known.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Still, all of that thinking really saps her energy. I need to go give some statements on her behalf, so I'll leave the recharging to you.

;(Talk to Chevreuse, optional)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You can leave the rest of this to me &mdash; the other Gardes will be joining me shortly. Don't worry, they won't have another chance to escape.
:{{DIcon}} There are still a few things I'm curious about...
:{{DIcon}} How did Elodie get her hands on the raw materials?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Hmm... The materials have many other regular uses outside of being used to make Imitation Sinthe, so they're not immediately subject to being confiscated or destroyed.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The harbor would usually just seize them for some time while the customs paperwork is filled out and approved. If approved, they'd be let through, and if not, they'd be returned to sender. Elodie probably used her position to replace a portion of the shipment with something else before sending the whole shipment back to sender.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Given that the foreign merchants who sent in the shipments were probably working with her in the first place, they likely just never reported the difference in what they sent and what they received.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918703 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' We will, of course, continue to investigate the rest of the details of this case. Now that we've caught Elodie, figuring out the whole scheme should just be a matter of time.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Lynette)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Mmm... Black tea and a cute kitty. Truly, the best combo for standby mode.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Want some?
:{{DIcon}} A cup of tea, please.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Mhm. I hope you'll like it.
::{{DIcon}} About Elodie's case...
::{{DIcon}} Are you not interested in any follow-up developments from it?
:{{DIcon}} A cute kitty, please.
::'''Bonnie:''' Meow~
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Ah, I see she's already starting to snuggle up to you.
::{{DIcon}} About Elodie's case...
::{{DIcon}} Are you not interested in any follow-up developments from it?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Not at all. Information is indeed very important, but if you were to try to collect every piece of information you come across, your efficiency would actually decrease.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Plus, if you just think about it... What sounds more fun? Writing a statement, or enjoying a tea party?
:{{DIcon}} The tea party.
:{{DIcon}} The cute kitty.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Great answer. That'd be my pick, too.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Had we not run into that case, we could have spent the entire day like this. But now, I'm running low on both time and energy...
:{{DIcon}} The key isn't how long you spend in standby mode.
:{{DIcon}} With quality time, you should be able to recharge more quickly.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...You are right, I can sense it. I'm recharging very quickly at the moment.
:{{DIcon}} I still have a question, though.
:{{DIcon}} When did you start to suspect Elodie?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Hmm, something about her rubbed me the wrong way since the very beginning. But, to be more precise... it was probably around the time when I saw Bonnie try to get away from her.
:{{DIcon}} After you arrested Bernard?
:{{DIcon}} Back then, Elodie tried to get close to Bonnie...
:'''Bonnie:''' Meow~
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Elodie tried to get close, but Bonnie deliberately dodged her. Maybe Bonnie had tried to evade her before at Pierre's base... or perhaps Bonnie just instinctively knew that she wasn't a good person.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 12.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Not everyone who like cats is a good person... But if cats like you, you're probably alright.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, fair enough!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Humans tend to overthink things, but cats rely on their instincts, and they're pretty sharp. I mean, just look at Bonnie...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918705 lynette 14.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...She took a liking to you the moment you met.
:'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
