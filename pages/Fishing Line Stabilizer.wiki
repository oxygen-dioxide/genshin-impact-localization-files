|effect      = A self-adaptive tension stabilizer that can be installed on a fishing rod to facilitate fishing. The device can automatically detect and record how hard different fish struggle.
|description = The more data it collects, the better the stabilizer works.<br /><br />The device's prototype was the pointless invention of a [[Fontaine]] inventor that drew little interest for the longest time until the Fontaine [[Fishing Association]] discovered it and modified the product into the fishing line stabilizer used today. When the device first came out, it was most warmly received by the Association members, and now it has gradually been promoted in other regions.<br />It is an exceptionally hot commodity in the [[Snezhnaya]]n market. Word has it that one of the Lord [[Harbingers]] is particularly fond of the product, which explains the hype.

'''Fishing Line Stabilizer''' is a [[gadget]] that can be purchased from any of the members of the [[Fishing Association]] for {{Item|Medaka|x=3}}.

While trying to reel in a [[fish]] while [[fishing]], the gadget gives buffs based on the number of fish of the same species the player has previously caught.

The gadget does not need to be equipped in order to take effect; whether or not the buffs are active can be controlled from the player's [[Inventory]].

==Buffs==
* No power (0 to 3 fish caught): Nothing changes.
* Low power (4 to 15 fish caught): Fishing is slightly faster. Loss of progress outside the Ideal Tension Zone moderately reduced.
* Full power (16+ fish caught): Fishing is moderately faster. Outside the Ideal Tension Zone, progress still increases.

|text1  = When you obtain the Fishing Line Stabilizer from the various Fishing Associations around the world, you can use it to assist in fishing.<br />The Fishing Line Stabilizer will be activated by default. You can actively choose to activate or deactivate the assistance of the Stabilizer.
|image2 = Tutorial Fishing Line Stabilizer 2.png
|text2  = While you are capturing certain fish, you will obtain certain buffs based on the number of fish of this species that you have caught in the past. For example, when you are within the Ideal Tension Zone, your fishing will progress faster.<br />A Stabilizer at full power can even allow fishing to progress when you are not within the Ideal Tension Zone.<br />If you would like to check the fish species that you have caught, you may visit Archive > Living Beings.

==Notes== 
* Fish caught before the gadget was bought are also counted.
* Ornamental fish caught are also counted for the gadget's buffs.
* Bonus fish caught using [[Thoma]]'s passive talent [[Snap and Swing]] is ignored by the requirement count.
<!--
* The speed bonus is multiplier based; it depends on the fish original difficulty.

Pending for tests:
* Regional fishing rod's effect stacks with the full power effect; multiplier or fixed flat? Timing record required.
* The fishing count does (not) include extra fish from Thoma's talent.
* The fishing count does (not) include fish(es) caught during limited event(s).
