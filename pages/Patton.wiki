==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Patton is [[Nora]]'s father. He works as a barker for Angel's Share after breaking a bottle of the "[[Crepus|last owner]]'s collector's red wine". The cost of reimbursement is so high, Patton calculates that without eating or sleeping, he will have to work 48 more years to win back his freedom.

:::'''Patton:''' I won! I didn't make a mistake this time!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Patton:''' Th&mdash;This mistake! How did this... Blast!
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror... ''<small>(Only available between "[[Dragon Storm]]" and "[[A Long Shot]]")</small>''
::'''Patton:''' *sigh* Honestly, that scared me to death. We don't know when Stormterror might attack again, either... but even so, I have to stand here and advertise the tavern.
::'''Patton:''' I do owe Master Diluc money, so much money that I'll have to stand out here without food, drink or sleep for another forty-eight years. If I slack off now, that time will get extended.
::'''Patton:''' ...I wonder if Master Diluc will clear my debt on account of the dragon's attacks?
::'''Patton:''' Probably not, haha... *sobs*
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Angel's Share.
::'''Patton:''' It was way back when the [[Dawn Winery]] was just established when the owner of the winery opened this tavern.
::'''Patton:''' The winery's owner, Master [[Diluc]], still holds the deed to Angel's Share. He really has taken the business to the next level.
::'''Patton:''' "The best in Mondstadt" is the truth.
::'''Patton:''' Master Diluc serves the customers here personally when he's in a good mood, and lets<!--"let" in-game--> [[Charles]] off for a day or two.
::'''Patton:''' If you see him here, be respectful. He is Mondstadt's tycoon, you know...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the wine industry in Mondstadt.
:::'''Patton:''' Mondstadt's climate, water, and crops are all perfect for making wine... I have to agree, we are blessed by the Anemo Archon!
:::'''Patton:''' Apple cider and cherry ciders all taste mighty nice &mdash; I forgot to mention dandelion wine! That's one of a kind!
:::'''Patton:''' By exporting to [[Liyue]]'s trade unions, Mondstadt's wines will be sold all over the continent.
:::'''Patton:''' They make incredible sales over there. Some even call it "bottled Mora."
:::'''Patton:''' This must be why Dawn Winery's owner is so filthy rich...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself.
:::'''Patton:''' Let me give you a piece of advice... Don't touch any of the bottles here, no matter how plain it looks...
:::'''Patton:''' The bottle I broke happened to be the last owner's collector's red wine... Do you see the villa to the north over there?
:::'''Patton:''' What I mean is, that wine cost as much as that villa.
:::'''Patton:''' By my calculations, I need to work 48 more years to pay it back... without sleeping and eating.
:::'''Patton:''' Well, it doesn't seem THAT hopeless if I think about it like that.
:::'''Patton:''' I need to get back to buying back my freedom... Hahaha... *coughs* *sobs*
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine, thanks.
::'''Patton:''' You leaving already? If you want to try Mondstadt's best wine, this is the place!
:{{DIcon|Reward}} Do you have any specials these days?
::'''Patton:''' Currently, we're giving every customer a free Chicken-Mushroom Skewer. It goes great with any drink!
::'''Patton:''' Here, take one and have a seat. I promise it'll suit your liking!
