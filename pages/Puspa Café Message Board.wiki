===Introduction===
<!-- The below dialogue is presented differently from the intro message in [[Mondstadt General Goods Order Board]] where it precedes all other messages. Here it's treated like a regular messaged displayed at random. Therefore it should be put under its own section. -->
:'''Message Board of Puspa Café:''' This is the message board of Puspa Café. For some reason, I will be the [[Enteka|Acting Manager of Puspa Café]] for the time being. If you have anything that you want to let us know, please feel free to leave a message.

===About Cyno===
:'''Message:''' "If you're here to play cards, please learn a lesson from me."
:'''Message:''' "I shouldn't have made up a non-existent card to deceive my fellow players while playing [[Genius Invokation TCG]]."
:'''Message:''' "[[Cyno|Lord Jackal]] has helped me realize my mistakes, and I'm here to confess."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Most people can't even realize their mistakes. But... who's this Lord Jackal again?"

===Afternoon-Long Argument===
:'''Message:''' "After so many years, this place is still so lively! Every time I come to this coffee shop, I can't help but recall that afternoon I spent arguing with him about the interpretations of a single word."
:'''Acting Manager's Reply:''' Our shop wouldn't be so lively without your patronage. Please do visit often.

===Exam Preparations===
:'''Message:''' "The atmosphere here is much more friendly than a tavern for a student like me who is preparing for an exam."
:'''Message:''' "There's coffee to keep me going and seniors to seek guidance from."
:'''Message:''' "Even the owner predicted I'll get in [[the Akademiya]] this year!"
:'''Acting Manager's Reply:''' May your wish come true.

===Free Advertising===
:'''Message:''' "The great researcher [[Pursina]]'s latest research suggests that drinking coffee improves your cognitive ability."
:'''Message:''' "If you're trying to get in the Akademiya, then visit this coffee shop often."
:'''Acting Manager's Reply:''' I'm very grateful that you're advertising our shop, but coffee will only give you a little more energy... Besides, the Mahamata might take actions against unfounded statements like this, right?

===Izem's Message===

:'''Message:''' "After retiring from the [[Corps of Thirty]], this is where I get my cup of coffee everyday."
:'''Message:''' "The acting manager makes me the same coffee every day, and the [[Maddah|storyteller]] tells the same story."
:'''Message:''' "Perhaps the essence of life in Sumeru lies in repetitions like this."

===Kaveh and Alhaitham===
:'''Message:''' "The stories Mr. Maddah tell may be old-fashioned, but he's quite skilled when it comes to controlling their pace."
:'''Message:''' "But everyone's used to getting their information from Akasha now, so they unconsciously overlook such sophistication of technique and artistic maturity."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "You need to be more realistic. No art form is eternal. The day when all of its value has been exploited is the day it loses its reason for existence."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Like how overripe fruits fall to the earth and provide nourishment for new plants."
:'''Message:''' "And that is exactly why I've always despised materialists like you. Art is a precious fruit of leisure. You can't compare it to production and exploitation for commercial purposes!"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Leisurely people are like people walking on a spherical ground -- they don't exist. Why don't you use your brain and think for a moment? Can the production of anything exist without commercial exchange?"
:'''Acting Manager's Reply:''' What a sharp clash of theories... Anyways, it's time for [[Kaveh|Mr. Kaveh]] to settle his bill for the month. Should it be put on your tab as usual, [[Alhaitham|Mr. Alhaitham]]?
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "No. That spoiled guy needs to experience the brutality of the business world."
:'''Message Seemingly From a Noble:''' "Miss Acting Manager, please put it on [[Dori|Lord Sangemah Bay]]'s tab. After all, one can't make art without coffee!"

===Maddah's Message===

:'''Message:''' "The legendary story of Antara will continue this week!"
:'''Message:''' "Presented to you by the Puspa Café's special resident storyteller, Maddah! Stay tuned!"
:'''Acting Manager's Reply:''' Mr. Maddah... We'll offer you a cup of coffee free of charge if you stop posting ads here.

===Matra's Message===
:'''Matra's Message:''' "There have been several cases of [[Canned Knowledge]] smuggling recently."
:'''Matra's Message:''' "Matra's special reminder: Please go through the authorized procedure when applying for and obtaining the knowledge you seek."
:'''Matra's Message:''' "Forbidden knowledge obtained through illegal channels will result in the revoking of your right to study in the Akademiya. Please be aware."

===Nayab's Message===

:'''Message:''' "The Puspa Card Club is recruiting members who play Genius Invokation TCG!"
:'''Message:''' "If you'd like to discuss deck setup and techniques, come find me at the card table!"
:'''Acting Manager's Reply:''' Mr. Nayab, at least order a cup of coffee if you're going to play cards here.

===Nilou's Message===
{{See also|Nilou}}
:'''Message:''' "Hehe... [[Gata]], hehehe..."
:'''Acting Manager's Reply:''' Gata seems to be really fond of you too, Miss Nilou.

===Nutty Gamble===
:'''Message:''' "I heard many bandits are popping up in the desert, and many merchants are refusing to travel the routes there. The price of Ajilenakh Nuts might start to skyrocket."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Awesome! I'm selling all my mushrooms for Ajilenakh Nuts right now! Haha! Perhaps this is the courage and vision of the Alkindi Clan!"
:'''Acting Manager's Reply:''' I'd love to see your wealth multiply, but I'd like to state that my shop is not responsible for any losses that may arise from the information on this board.

===Rishboland Raja===
:'''Message:''' "Be careful, everyone! My friend ran into the Rishboland Raja in the middle of the night in the northwest forest! He was lucky to make it back in one piece. Still, don't go out after sunset!"
