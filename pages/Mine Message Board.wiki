===Safety Notice: Article 133===
:'''Safety Notice:''' ...
:'''Safety Notice:''' "Article 133: Mining tools are not to be disassembled or repaired without authorization. In case of a malfunction or problem, the equipment in question is to be delivered to the [[Apoxpalon|Macuahuitl Workshop]]!"
:'''Safety Notice:''' "And definitely don't go thinking the mining tools safe operations limits are set too low, or that they aren't up to the task, and make your own personal 'super modifications' to them..."
:'''Safety Notice:''' "Last time, one of the crew adjusted the drill's power to three times the normal output... He's still in the hospital recovering, and we don't have any indication when his bones will mend or his hearing will recover."
:'''Safety Notice:''' "If you're still not convinced, why not go have a chat with him yourself?"

===Safety Notice: Article 145===
:'''Safety Notice:''' ...
:'''Safety Notice:''' "Article 145: While on breaks during the night shift, if any workers still have the extra energy, time, and mood for such things, a reminder that no dance battling is allowed in the mines!"
:'''Message:''' "Why not? Afraid that if too many people dance, the mining pit'll collapse?"
:'''Reply:''' "Now you're a smart [[Saurus Crackers|Saurian cookie]]! But that's just part of it. The primary reason is that night dance battles are {{sic|nor|expected=now}} only allowed to take place on the [[Stage Tepetl (Point of Interest)|Stage Tepetl]]."
:'''Reply:''' "Besides, isn't it just a colossal waste to dance where the lighting's bad, nobody's watching, and you can't even see your own moves properly?"

===Cafeteria Update===
:'''Kitchen Notice:''' "New dining option in the miner's cafeteria available this week!"
:'''Kitchen Notice:''' "Combining the [[Jueyun Chili]]s from [[Liyue]] cuisine with [[Blazed Meat Stew]], it has a fiery texture and colors bright as paint that'll give the fire in your bellies all the fuel it needs!"
:'''Kitchen Notice:''' "Still, all mining crew members are encouraged to only try this new dish after work, as you may need to consume inordinate amounts of water, which may be detrimental to mining work."
:'''Message:''' "Spicy? Yesss, that's what I'm talking about! The [[Fonta]]-flavored [[Grainfruit Meat Soup]] [[Cempoa]] invented last time was pretty good, nice and sweet, but it wasn't very filling..."
:'''Kitchen Notice:''' "Thanks for your support! As for the Fonta-flavored Grainfruit Meat Soup, in light of the various different kinds of feedback received, the chefs will continue to modify and improve the dish and offer it from time to time as a specialty!"

:'''Lil' Saurian Announcements:''' "This Month's Naughtiest Lil' Saurian: [[Momo]]. Reason: 'Sharpening its teeth on [[Xilonen]]'s potted plants, fighting with other Saurians in the middle of the night, stealing snacks, and hiding in [[Chanil]]'s house to avoid punishment.'"

===Ore Trade Update===
:'''Miner's Message:''' "I've heard that the wild aren't very safe recently, and that monster attacks on merchant caravans are getting more and more frequent. How will that affect sales of our tribe's ores? Will it impact the incomes of our crew?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "As for the problem with the volume of ore sales, Boss [[Pacal]] has mentioned it. The number of tourists visiting the [[People of the Springs]] has increased significantly, so they'll be importing way more raw materials than last year..."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "The [[Scions of the Canopy]] are equipping their Couriers with new gear, and they need raw metals the most. The [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] and [[Flower-Feather Clan]] are both conducting extensive building renovations, so they'll also be using a considerable amount of ores."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "As for the [[Collective of Plenty]], trade's always been stable, and the produce from [[Varesa]]'s place has gotten even cheaper, so there's no need to worry about income!"
:'''A Third Person's Message:''' "I'd like to add that I've heard that all the tribes are in the middle of reorganizing their anti-monster patrols in accordance with the experience of the veterans, so the current increased threat is only temporary."
:'''A Third Person's Message:''' "And so what if there's a few more monsters? We [[Children of Echoes]] happen to have more energy and zeal than we know what to do with! Put down your pickaxes and pick up your axes, we'll cut 'em all down!"

:'''Miner's Message:''' "The unstable rocks you discovered before have already been taken care of, and no property damage or injuries occurred."
:'''Miner's Message:''' "Though you left without saying a word, we all know you're a really enthusiastic and strong young lady!"
:'''Miner's Message:''' "We'll all be rooting for you this [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame|Pilgrimage]]! Buck up, and don't think about the past! We're with you all the way!"
