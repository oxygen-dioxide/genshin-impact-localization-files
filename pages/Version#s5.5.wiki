|description = In Natlan, hosting a heart-pounding, adrenaline-pumping competition is a marvelous undertaking.<br>But organizing one so thrilling that it unites all six tribes? That is truly a magnificent feat, indeed.<br>And so, as they have done countless times in centuries of yore, humans and saurians once again race across this ancient land.<br>The spirit of competition burns eternal, just like the flames of Natlan.

==Adjustments & Optimizations==
;Artifacts
* In the "[[Artifact]]" interface, the "Quick Select" option in "[[Artifact Salvage]]" automatically selects all Artifacts by default.
* In the "Artifact Enhancement" interface, when using the "Quick Select" function, [[Artifact Enhancement Material]]s are prioritized over 5-star Artifacts.
* After the version update, Artifacts defined through the consumption of [[Sanctifying Elixir]]s will be marked, and are guaranteed to get at least 2 rolls for the defined Minor Affixes when fully leveled up.

;Serenitea Pot
* Adjusts the layout of the "[[Realm Depot]]" interface to display more items.
* Adjusts the "Realm Depot" interface by adding a "Exchange List" feature, which allows you to add items to a list for redemption, adjust quantities, and perform batch redemptions within the list.

;Android Controller Support
* Adds controller support for Android devices. The following are the supported controller models and system requirements:
** DualSense™ Wireless Controller: Android 12.0 and above;
** DUALSHOCK®4 Wireless Controller: Android 10.0 and above;
** Xbox Wireless Controller: Android 9.0 and above;
** Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2: Android 9.0 and above.
* The controller needs to be connected to the device in Bluetooth mode.

;Controller
* Optimizes the operation experience of certain wheel-related button combinations in controller mode (taking DualSense™ wireless controller as an example):
** Slightly increases the time required to hold L1 button to display the wheel interface.
** The "L1 + right stick" combination is still able to quickly open the wheel interface.
** Other button combinations will no longer open the wheel interface (e.g., when interacting with the [[Four-Leaf Sigil]], activating [[Elemental Sight]], etc.), and will instead perform the corresponding action immediately upon pressing.

* When crafting "Condensed Resin" on the "Craft" interface, if there is insufficient Original Resin but replenishment options are available, a prompt will appear with options to replenish Original Resin.

;Audio
* Optimizes Chinese, English, and Japanese voice-overs in certain quests, and improves sound effects for certain Chinese voice-overs.
* After Version 5.5 is updated, [[Kinich]]'s VA will be updated to Jacob Takanashi (this change only applies to new content in Version 5.5, historical content will be gradually updated in subsequent versions).
* After the Version 5.5 update, the character [[Ifa]]'s Japanese VA will be updated to Terashima Junta.

;Other Systems
* Removing [[friend]]s, adding friends to the blacklist, or removing a friend from the blacklist will no longer refresh the scrolling interface for the "Friends" and "Blacklist" interfaces.

* Adds a new icon for food effects.
* If there are entrances to other environment maps in the "[[Map]]" interface, (such as "[[Enkanomiya]]"), an icon will be displayed. Press it to view information about the corresponding environment.
* Optimizes the display logic for red dots of the "[[Spiral Abyss]]" in the "[[Events Overview]]" interface.
* When tracking [[Normal Boss|boss enemies]] in the "[[Adventurer Handbook]]" or "[[Event]]s" menu:
** If the nearest [[Teleport Waypoint]] to the enemy has been unlocked, you can use the sidebar in the "Map" interface to directly teleport to that waypoint and track the enemy.
** If the nearest Teleport Waypoint to the enemy is not unlocked, the "Map" interface will track and guide the Traveler to the enemy's location.
* In Version 5.5, this feature will support boss enemies in the "[[Natlan]]" region, as well as boss enemies related to the 5-star characters featured during Version 5.5. In [[Version 5.6]], this feature will support all boss enemies.

;Other

* Reduces the cooldown time for successfully locating an [[Oculus]] using the "[[Oculus Resonance Stone]]" from 5 minutes to 2 minutes.

* Adds compatibility support for iPad Air (M3) and iPad (A16) devices.
* Decreases the maximum amount of reaction DMG caused by [[Burning]] grass and [[Electro-Charged]] water bodies in Domains.
