==Steps==
Start the quest by interacting with the collapsed figure ???, located just outside the cave between [[Samudra Coast]] and [[Asipattravana Swamp]]. (See Gameplay Notes for details.)
# Speak to the person who has fallen on the ground
# Return with [[Julien]] to his camp
# Talk to Julien
# Look for Julien's luggage in the water
# Look for Julien's luggage in the water
# Look for Julien's luggage on the beach
# Check on [[Pepper (NPC)|the dog]] on the beach
# Investigate the sand pile
# Defeat all opponents {{Enemy List|Blazing Axe Mitachurl;Hilichurl*2}}
# Go to the camp and talk to Julien

==Gameplay Notes==
*Julien's starting location can be reached two ways:
*# From the northernmost [[Teleport Waypoint]] in [[Gavireh Lajavard]], head to Samudra Coast and follow the waterway to the east
*# Take the left-hand path after entering the cave in Asipattravana Swamp, unlocked during Step 7 of the {{Quest|Asipattravana Itihasa}}, and clear out the [[Gray Crystal]]
*#* This method is also a prerequisite for the follow-up quest, ''[[An Artist Adrift (Part 2)]]''

{{Quest Description|You find an artist from [[Fontaine]] in distress in a cave by the water...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach ???)
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, look! Someone's collapsed over there. Let's go take a look!

;(Talk to ???)
:'''Julien:''' Ugh...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like this guy's not doing so good... He must be famished! Let's give him some of our food, shall we, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} May this food give him strength.
::'''Paimon:''' Not to be biased or anything, but Paimon thinks you make great food!
:{{DIcon}} Well, he's not you.
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon! Everyone's definitely fainted from hunger at least once in their lives, right?

: '''''You give the collapsed man some [[Teyvat Fried Egg]].'''''

:'''Julien:''' I... I live! I live again!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, he must really have been starving. That was just one fried egg...
:'''Julien:''' Ah, that unspeakable deliciousness was enough to revive the dead, surely! If I had known that fried eggs could taste this glorious, I would've bought that mysterious egg off that fellow.
:'''Paimon:''' What mysterious egg?
:'''Julien:''' It is said that eating the egg can help you deflect a day's worth of misfortune. Oh, how I wish I'd bought one... or perhaps even twelve...
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, that sounds really suspicious &mdash; and Paimon reckons she knows a scam when she sees one. Still, how did you end up here?
:'''Julien:''' I... Well, I'm a renowned artist from [[Fontaine]], and I'm here in Sumeru to gather inspiration for my work. Call me Julien.
:{{DIcon}} Inspiration? Here?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah. Aren't there more suitable places for gathering inspiration? Y'know, someplace with a better view and better safety measures?
:{{DIcon}} Does anyone even call themselves a "renowned" anything?
::'''Paimon:''' Exactly!
:'''Paimon:''' Also, if you're an artist from Fontaine, why are you empty-handed?&nbsp;... You're actually a [[Fatui]] mole, aren't you?
:'''Julien:''' Such radical reasoning! So radical, in fact, that one wonders what experiences may have led you to even have such thoughts! However, I am an artist, and nothing but that, I fear.
:'''Julien:''' It's just that... Well, I had already gained enough inspiration here and was preparing to return to Fontaine with what I'd gained.
:'''Julien:''' I never expected that Sumeru's weather could be so dry. When I passed through [[Chenyu Vale]] on my way here, the air still felt relatively humid, but the sandstorms started picking up the moment I stepped into Sumeru's bounds...
:'''Julien:''' I must confess that I'm better suited to wetter climates, so I was planning to travel back by water to experience different scenery, but my raft was washed away, and I'm not a swimmer, so...
:{{DIcon}} I imagine you must have had a hard time living in Fontaine.
:'''Julien:''' That is the case, though it is not merely a matter of being a swimmer or not... *sigh* Never mind. I did find a place to rest by the water and there are still some tea leaves that have yet to become completely sodden. Allow me to thank you...
:'''Paimon:''' By inviting us to have some tea?
:'''Julien:''' Oh, of course, of course! I shall have to express my gratitude for the gift of the fried egg, indeed. How should I address the two of you?
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, right, Paimon almost forgot about introductions!
:{{DIcon}} We're {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} The envoy of justice and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} attendant.
::'''Paimon:''' We're {{Traveler}} and Paimon &mdash; the awesomest companion!
:{{DIcon}} Call us Shining Gold and Silver Glimmer.
::'''Paimon:''' We're the Shining Gold {{Traveler}}, and the Silver Glimmering Paimon!
:'''Julien:''' Ah, such brilliant names. Well, whatever the case, come and have some tea. My camp is nearby. In fact, we're almost there.

:'''Julien:''' Speaking of which, what brings the two of you here? You're not here for the same reasons as me... right?
:'''Paimon:''' You mean, did we travel here just to make some art? Nah, of course not!
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}'s a registered adventurer. It should be no surprise finding {{MC|m=him|f=her}} in every corner of Teyvat!

;(After arriving at the camp)
:'''Paimon:''' What a simple camp... Paimon wonders if you could even call it a camp.
:'''Julien:''' Well, the scenery here is quite good, and there's a sense of openness whenever I stand by the water. It's honestly a lot more relaxing than when I was in Fontaine.
:'''Paimon:''' What sort of life did you lead while you were there, seriously? That's... not quite what Paimon was expecting from a renowned artist.
:'''Julien:''' I lived in a very small place back in Fontaine... And um, that's only because I'm a humble person.
:'''Paimon:''' But even outdoor adventurer camps look way better than this. Huh? You have an animal buddy?
:'''Julien:''' Um, I don't have one. This must've been left behind by an adventurer or something like that. Speaking of which...
:'''Julien:''' I would love to receive you in better fashion, but most of my luggage fell into the water when my raft fell apart, and I cannot swim...
:'''Julien:''' But if you could find my lost luggage for me...
:{{DIcon}} Would it even be usable after getting soaked like that...
:'''Julien:''' I did carefully pack everything up, but there are some things that... *sigh* Well, if I've lost them, I've lost them. I can always redraw them... yes, redraw them...
:'''Paimon:''' Um, perhaps we should help out. This guy seems like he's in a real bad spot.
:'''Julien:''' I have no one else to rely on here, so I can only ask the two of you for aid. I'll be waiting here with some good tea in hand.

;(Speak to Julien again, optional)
:'''Julien:''' I'm counting on you regarding my luggage...

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Julien, optional)
:'''Julien:''' (That fried egg was simply out of this world. I wish I could have another bite...)
----
;(Pick up the first piece of {{Item|Julien's Luggage}})
:'''Paimon:''' This should be the thing Julien's looking for, right? There might be others, so let's look around a bit.

;(Pick up the second piece of ''Julien's Luggage'')
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, there's more stuff over here. Perhaps some might even have been carried ashore by the waves. Let's go to the beach and have a look!

;(Approach the dog)
:'''Paimon:''' Strange. Why would there be a dog here? And it seems to be guarding something, too.
:'''Dog:''' (Watches you warily.)
:{{DIcon}} Smart doggie.
::'''Dog:''' (Gives a short bark.)
:{{DIcon}} Where did this wild dog come from, anyway...
::'''Dog:''' (Gives a low growl.)
:'''Paimon:''' Right, didn't we see a food bowl back at Julien's camp? Maybe it belongs to this fella! Strange, though. Didn't Julien say that he didn't have any animal companions?
:'''Dog:''' *whimpers*

: '''''The dog runs toward the camp...'''''

:'''Paimon:''' It's gone... Let's ask Julien about this later. For now, though... Paimon wonders what's under this sand pile. Should we take a look?

;(After using Anemo to blow away the sand pile)
:'''Paimon:''' That's a drawing board! That's gotta be Julien's. Let's haul it back together with the rest. The tea's probably ready by now, so we've gotta hurry!
;(Obtain {{Item|Julien's Drawing Board}})

;(A mob of hilichurls appears)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Where did these guys come from? We didn't do anything to make them angry, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Are they trying to steal the drawing board? But there's nothing special about it...

;(After defeating the hilichurls)
:'''Paimon:''' Running immediately after defeat... What a strange bunch...
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway... Let's go back and find Julien first!
----
;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Julien, optional)
:'''Julien:''' ...

:'''Paimon:''' We're back! Huh, so it is your animal companion, Julien!
:'''Dog:''' (Lets out a threatening growl.)
:'''Julien:''' Wonderful, Pepper... Taken to growling at me, have you? Don't you know who's keeping us both fed here?
:'''Paimon:''' (Oh, so it has a name! But on the other hand... is this guy seriously arguing with a dog?)
:{{DIcon}} (They seem to be really close.)
::'''Paimon:''' (Is that what "close" looks like to you!?)
:{{DIcon}} (I don't smell any wine...)
::'''Paimon:''' (Is he just usually like that? Seems like a rather troublesome guy...)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Julien! We found the stuff you lost! Pepper's your animal buddy, isn't it? Why did you lie to us earlier?
:'''Julien:''' If this ungrateful fellow counts as my buddy... I'd rather adopt a Rifthound.
:{{DIcon}} I doubt that you'll be companions for very long...
:'''Paimon:''' Exactly. If someone like you, who faints from hunger, ran into a Rifthound, the resulting problem wouldn't be one we could solve with just a Teyvat Fried Egg...
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, it seems to have been guarding a drawing board on the beach.
:{{DIcon}} It might have wanted to hide it...
::'''Paimon:''' Bad doggie!
:{{DIcon}} It might have been protecting the drawing board from being stolen.
::'''Paimon:''' But it ran off the moment we found it!
:'''Pepper:''' (Barks, seemingly in protest.)
:'''Julien:''' Are you seriously whining about this? If I hadn't followed you into this corner, I could've returned to Fontaine via my original path...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Didn't you say that you ended up taking the waterways because you wanted to see the sights there?
:'''Julien:''' ...
:'''Julien:''' Okay, fine... The truth is, I didn't even get to enjoy Sumeru's scenery &mdash; I just followed the dog and ended up in this place. The roads here point in all directions, so it was impossible to not get lost...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's how it was. C'mon, you should have just told us the truth from the start! Why didn't you?
:'''Julien:''' Um... To... preserve the image of a renowned artist?
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, you sound like you're just trying to fake us out when you stammer like that, and you're not very good at it either!
:'''Paimon:''' But speaking of scenery here in Sumeru, {{Traveler}} and Paimon do happen to know some good spots. We can take you there.
:'''Julien:''' N&mdash;No need. Um, I mean... thanks for your offer, but I am a renowned artist, after all. Ultimately, I believe that worthwhile sceneries must be ones that we discover ourselves...
:'''Julien:''' Oh, and the tea's ready. Do you also happen to have more fried eggs? You know, as a little snack to go with the tea...
:{{DIcon}} What an unusual combo.
::'''Paimon:''' Exactly! {{Traveler}}'s a master of many dishes! We can always have something else instead, hehe.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds like wishful thinking to me.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... But tea alone feels like it's missing something, you know? Let's just whip something up.

:'''''You enjoy the tea together with some snacks.<br>The tea's taste is hard to describe...'''''

:'''Paimon:''' Um, this tea...
:'''Julien:''' A friend of mine sold it to me. Apparently, it can activate the potential wisdom within you. I think it tastes great.
:{{DIcon}} I'm glad I don't have any friends like that.
::'''Julien:''' How come? Having friends is a good thing. In fact, I came to Sumeru on a friend's recommendation as well.
:{{DIcon}} Could you give me another cup?
::'''Paimon:''' You sure there's nothing wrong with your taste buds, {{Traveler}}?
::'''Julien:''' Haha, not to be stingy or anything, but I'll still be in Sumeru for a while, so I need to save some for myself.
:'''Julien:''' Thank you both for what you've done for me today. I hope the compensation I prepared meets your expectations...
:'''Paimon:''' It's fine, it's just... You sure you don't need our help in gathering inspiration? Paimon feels like you might get lost.
:'''Julien:''' The point of a pilgrimage... I mean, the point of a journey lies in walking it by oneself. I shouldn't trouble you two any further. I will undertake this myself.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, sure, if you say so. Make sure you don't faint from hunger on the road again!

;(Talk to Julien again, optional)
:'''Julien:''' The path of pilgrimage. How did I lose track of it...
:'''Paimon:''' ...The path of pilgrimage?
:'''Julien:''' Ah, it's nothing. It's just... just a figure of speech.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Julien, optional)
:'''Julien:''' (I'm sure my friend would never deceive me...)

;(Talk to Pepper, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Should we leave it something nice to eat?
:'''Dog:''' (Looks at you expectantly.)
