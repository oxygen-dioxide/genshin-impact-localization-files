<li>For 10s after a character uses an Elemental Burst, that character's Normal and Charged Attacks will unleash a shockwave at the position of the opponent they hit at the cost of 1% of the character's HP, dealing AoE DMG. This effect will be cleared when this character leaves the field. A shockwave can be unleashed in this manner once every 1s. Active characters can go down as a result of this HP loss.</li>
