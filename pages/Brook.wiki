==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Brook:''' Hi, did the beautiful fragrance of my cooking entice you over here? Hehehe.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I would like to buy something to eat.
::'''Brook:''' Sure thing. How about a fresh steak? There's nothing better in all of Mondstadt.
:;(Opens shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you? ''(Only available before completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)''
::'''Brook:''' You don't know who I am? I'm Brook. My meat-based recipes are very well known in Mondstadt.
:{{DIcon}} We meet again! ''(After completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)''
::'''Brook:''' Hey, aren't you the assistant for [[Xiangling]], the chef from [[Liyue]]?
::'''Brook:''' You couldn't possibly be here by coincidence. I've got it! She must want to challenge me again. I am "Mondstadt's Rotisseur Queen," after all.
::'''Brook:''' Oh... That's not it, huh? Well seeing as she already beat me last time, I guess challenging me again wouldn't prove much.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Brook:''' If you want the absolutely freshest meat possible, it has to go straight from the hunt to the kitchen with not a moment wasted.
::'''Brook:''' That's the reason I moved to [[Springvale]].
::'''Brook:''' Of course, I do sell the vast majority of my cooking...
::'''Brook:''' But the single freshest piece of meat in the day? I normally keep it as a treat for myself.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} That smells great...
:::'''Brook:''' Haha, of course. This steak was made by me, Brook, after all!
:::'''Brook:''' I can say with confidence that I make the best steaks in Mondstadt.
:::'''Brook:''' Have you tried some before? If you haven't, you can get a sample now.
:::'''Brook:''' Don't be shy. This is flavor that will revolutionize your taste buds!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Delicious Steak|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Brook:''' Bon appétit... I mean, goodbye!

:'''Brook:''' Have you made any progress in your investigation into the meteorite strike yet? You'll get to the bottom of it. I'm sure of it.
:'''Brook:''' The victims will probably be ravenous when they do eventually wake up, won't they? So, I'd better start preparing some meals for them.

===Windblume's Breath===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Brook:''' Oh, did the wondrous fragrance of my cooked meat draw another? Hehehe.
:'''Brook:''' You can really tell it's the holidays when the streets are full in this little town. Even outlanders have come to visit.
:'''Brook:''' I thought [[Tighnari|he]] was here to ask for directions, but instead he surprised me when he inquired if I knew how to make any dishes using [[Philanemo Mushroom]]s.
:'''Brook:''' Cooking with Philanemo Mushrooms... isn't impossible. But at most, they just accent the meat.
