==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Fourmon:''' The lines here are a bit wooden too. Maybe the writing should better reflect the characters' inner psychology and mentality, the audience should be able to understand this part of the plot...
:'''[[Meilhat]]:''' Ah, please refrain, Fourmon. Are you going to obfuscate the dialogue to the point the audience is left guessing again?
:'''Meilhat:''' Do you recall the last performance? Nobody understood any of it! All they could say was "Didn't understand much but seemed very avant-garde!" And we were trying to write a situational comedy...
:'''Fourmon:''' B&mdash;But of course it won't be like the last time...
:'''Meilhat:''' Don't be unreasonable, Fourmon. You need to consider the audience's perspective when you try to decide how to communicate the meaning of the play.
;(Before completing ''Scenes from Life in Meropide: An Actor's Training'')
::'''Fourmon:''' You're right. Okay, okay, I'll do another edit.
::'''Meilhat:''' You'll need to be quick. We have a rehearsal this evening.
;(After completing ''Scenes from Life in Meropide: An Actor's Training'')
::'''Meilhat:''' I recall {{sic|{{Traveler}} advice}} that if we want the audience to give us clear feedback, we need to express ourselves fully first...
::'''Fourmon:''' That rehearsal went well, didn't it? But... *sigh* You're right. Okay, okay, I'll do another edit.
::'''Meilhat:''' Be quick about it. We have a rehearsal this evening.
:'''Fourmon:''' ...As you wish, Miss Meilhat.
