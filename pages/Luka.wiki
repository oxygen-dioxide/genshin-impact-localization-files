{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Luka:''' Ah, what a lovely day! Well, are you ready for a taste of the bartender life?
:{{DIcon}} Let's give it a shot.
::'''Luka:''' Wonderful! I wish you good luck today as well.
:{{DIcon}} About "Bartender Academy Week"...
::'''Luka:''' Well, this activity was originally intended to enlist new talent for our tavern.
::'''Luka:''' The drinkers are many, but those who mix drinks are few. Charles can barely get a single day off all year...
::'''Luka:''' As such, we started this event to help drum up interest in the bartending occupation!
::'''Luka:''' What do you think, Traveler? What do you say?"
::{{DIcon}} It's an intriguing prospect.
:::'''Luka:''' Aha, that's what I love to hear! Guess this was all worth it!
::{{DIcon}} It was pretty tough...
:::'''Luka:''' Ah, I see, I suppose the work was quite difficult.
::'''Luka:''' Whatever the case, the atmosphere in the tavern while you were there was great. In fact, the streets have been filled with customers this entire time...
::'''Luka:''' And while this wasn't our original intention, all's well that ends well, don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Luka:''' Sure, no problem. Please come back whenever you've got the time.
