'''Humanoid Ruin Machines''' (''unofficial name'') are mechanical war machines fallen from the lost nation of [[Khaenri'ah]]. They are part of the [[Automatons]] enemy family, along with the [[Ruin Sentinel]] enemy group.

These machines will either be patrolling a fixed route or will be in a dormant state, activating when the player gets too close to them. They may also appear as scenery, although these are considerably different to enemy versions as [[Elemental Sight]] will not glow off them, are placed in various positions or are unusually smaller in size (for [[Ruin Hunter]]s).
