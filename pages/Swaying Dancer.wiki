|description    = A strange shrub growing within the [[Forest of Blessings]]. It sways with the wind, graceful and relaxed like a dancer. Visitors from [[Inazuma]] think they look like the [[Seagrass]] that grows in shallow waters and might have the potential to uniquely season one's cooking. However, this type of shrub is also made of paper, so it probably wouldn't taste great as part of any recipe...
