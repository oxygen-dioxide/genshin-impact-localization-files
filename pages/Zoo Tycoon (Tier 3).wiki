* Despite being added in [[Version 2.3]], this achievement could not be earned until April 18, 2022 at the earliest, due to its high requirements. The game was in [[Version 2.6]] during this date. <!--Since 11 nets are given for completing the quest, 89 nets must be purchased, which takes 18 weeks minimum if 5 are purchased every week. Counting from the week of December 20, 2021 (when the quest became available), the Monday of the 18th week is April 18, 2022.-->
