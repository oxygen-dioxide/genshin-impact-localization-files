The '''Thunderbird Civilization''' was an ancient civilization from over 2000 years ago that worshipped [[Kanna Kapatcir]].

==History==
It is unknown where the people originated from, but it is likely that they were descendants of the [[Pre-Thunderbird Civilization]] that lived in Tsurumi Island's underground.

===Legacy===
As of present day, the only lasting lineage of the Thunderbird Civilization is survived by [[Kama]].

==Language==
The people of the Thunderbird civilization used a written language known as the [[Ishine Script]].

==Culture==
The people of the Thunderbird Civilization worshipped [[Kapatcir]], the Thunderbird. They used her feathers to make an instrument known as the [[Maushiro]] in order to communicate with each other through the fog. Later, there was a wooden imitation used instead.

There was a strict social hierarchy, with priests and religious officials being towards the top.

The people of the Thunderbird civilization performed human sacrifice as they believed that it pleased their deity.
