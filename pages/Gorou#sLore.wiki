}}
Gorou, like all of [[Watatsumi Island]]'s inhabitants, is a loyal supporter of [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]. Kokomi trusts him to lead the [[Watatsumi Army]] as its primary general, being sincere, determined and courageous. He has a strong sense of camaraderie and gets along well with all of the soldiers under his command, who in turn share the same sentiment and speak to him if any issues arise, including new recruits.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Sangonomiya Kokomi|About Gorou}}</ref> [[Kaedehara Kazuha|Kazuha]] describes Gorou as a person who says what is on his mind, uninhibited by others' feelings.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaedehara Kazuha|About Gorou}}</ref>

In the heat of battle, Kokomi remarks that Gorou tends to have a habit of letting the adrenaline rush to his head, often requiring someone to keep him in check when he heads to the battlefield. While he considers himself to be mostly inexperienced due to his age, he tries his best to help out with any problems that may arise. He is comfortable speaking with others apart from [[Yae Miko]], as the kitsune frequently talks in a manner that he finds himself completely flustered to the point that he instinctively hides from her if given the chance.

Gorou has dog blood in his veins and shares several of their traits, including the ability to mostly understand what they are saying from a single bark. His ears also twitch accordingly depending on what emotion is evoked. If he is particularly happy, his tail begins wagging, something that he considers embarrassing, yet is unable to control and is sometimes oblivious to. He also wishes to be taller and more muscular so that his soldiers can identify him easily on the battlefield.

He is fond of sweets due to their rarity in military life, but avoids onions as it is implied to be poisonous to him. He is also fond of mountaineering as it builds strength and camaraderie, expressing a desire to scale Liyue's mountains if he gets the chance to travel there.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Gorou is a young man with fair skin, light orange-brown hair and teal blue eyes. He belongs to a race of humans with physical animal traits, much like [[Diona]]. He has erect pointy ears and a bushy tail of the same color with white highlights on the front of his hair, ears, and tail.

Gorou wears an igote with shinobi shōzoku trousers, showing the bottom half of his torso while still covering up his legs and arms. The upper armor goes around his neck, in a collar-like formation. At the front of it is a small gold paw print symbol, which has a bow hanging below it. His Inazuman [[Geo]] [[Vision]] is seen on the upper-middle back of his armor.

Gorou's outfit, [[Panoply of a Hundred Hunts]], is light armor designed to grant him mobility and flexibility while using his bow, with plating on his left shoulder and arm for protection.

{{Quote|Kindness and loyalty are the representation of virtue. Without a doubt, my friend Gorou is a virtuous general.|[[Kaedehara Kazuha]]}}
A loyal and brave general of Watatsumi island. Born with a beast-like fighting intuition and tenacious will, he can find a way to victory even in the most critical moments.

He leads the Watatsumi troops, who have far fewer military resources compared to the [[Shogunate]]. Gorou strives to ensure that the inhabitants of this island will live in safety and peace.

Outsiders may not be able to imagine that Gorou, someone who faced thousands of enemies on the battlefield, is actually very affable and gets along with all his subordinates.

In Gorou's eyes, the people around him are not only his brave soldiers, they are also his beloved companions. They are like treasure to be cared for and protected. The land that sustains us, the comrades who support us, the faith that encourages us to move forward... These are the most precious things for Gorou, to whom he devotes his loyalty and courage.

Within Gorou exists a soul as vast and reliable as the earth.

Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.</p><p>Leaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.</p><p>At this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.</p><p>They would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.</p><p>When asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:</p><p>"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got."</p><p>"I'll take responsibility if the plan fails."</p><p>After holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] herself.</p><p>After that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General.</p>

Every time the granaries were opened, he would supervise the process strictly to prevent any unlawful deductions.</p><p>And as General Gorou, he will always lead from the front.</p><p>The sight of him charging at the tip of the spear is like a rallying banner, encouraging the troops behind him to continue advancing.</p><p>These are all reasons why the troops greatly respect him. As with Kokomi, Gorou greatly treasures the lives of his troops, but by contrast, values his own quite little.</p><p>Some who understand little of the thought process behind this occasionally joke that Gorou is a "kid" who doesn't seem like a general at all.</p><p>But to the soldiers of Watatsumi Island, this kid is the best general they could ask for.</p>

Here, readers will write about the things that trouble them and send them to Yae Publishing House, upon which Gorou will give them some suggestions.</p><p>Yae Publishing House will take special care to redact any personal information revealed on the part of the write-ins or Gorou's replies, and will replace real names with pseudonyms.</p><p>According to Yae Miko, she chose him because she'd heard that he often listened to his subordinates when they chatted about personal matters.</p><p>The column proved to be very popular indeed, but for whatever reason, every time an editor delivers the royalties to Gorou, they might sheepishly ask:</p><p>"Ah, speaking of which, Gorou, have you heard of Ms. Hina?"</p><p>"I've heard that she's a rather popular columnist, and a recent one, too. Is something the matter?"</p><p>"Oh, no, no... It's nothing..."</p>

==Trivia==
*Gorou's English voice actor, Cory Yee, also voices [[Draff]], [[Huffman]], [[Six-Fingered José]], [[Liuliu]], [[Farrah]] and the [[Abyss Lectors]].
*After taking up employment in the Yae Publishing House's "That's Life" column, Miko developed the pen name "Ms. Hina" to boost the column's sales. He appears to be somewhat aware of the identity. Ms. Hina's appearance depicted on a pamphlet and billboard strongly resembles a female version of Gorou, with the Ms. Hina Fan Club mistaking Gorou as her blood relative.
*Gorou is known by these aliases or titles:
**Top Dog Gorou ("Big/Elder Brother Gorou" in Chinese, Japanese and Korean)
**Ms. Hina
*Gorou's aversion to onion is a reference to how dogs are unable to consume onions as it is poisonous to them.
*Gorou is seen wielding the ascended version of the [[Raven Bow]] in his portrait art, despite the bow's passive trait increasing DMG against opponents affected by [[Hydro]] or [[Pyro]] by 12%, and the second stat type being [[Elemental Mastery]].
*Gorou is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Camp Bow-Rack: Fletching]]".

===Etymology===
*{{Lang|Gorou|ja=五郎}} is a Japanese name meaning "fifth son", and is possibly a play on the Chinese words for "dog" and "wolf." The Japanese reading of the first part of Gorou's name, {{Lang|五|ja=''go''}} is similar to the Chinese word for {{Lang|dog|zh=狗|zh_rm=gǒu}}; while the second part of his name in Chinese, {{Lang|郎|zh=''láng''}}, is pronounced identically to the word for {{Lang|wolf|zh=狼|zh_rm=láng}}.
**[[Kujou Sara]] remarks on how she has heard rumors of him being a fifth-born son.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kujou Sara|About Gorou}}</ref>
*Gorou could also be named after the samurai {{w|Shiba_Gor%C5%8D|Shiba Gorou}} (柴 五郎).
**Gorou's design of being a dog could reference the general's surname "Shiba" which is the same word as the {{W|Shiba Inu}}, a Japanese breed of hunting dog.
**The {{Lang|Japanese name of his constellation|ja=柴犬座|ja_rm=Shiba inu-za|ja_tl=Brushwood dog constellation}} could allude to the same.
