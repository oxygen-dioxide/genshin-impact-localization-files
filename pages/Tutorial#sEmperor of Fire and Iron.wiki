|text1    = An Armored Crablord that has survived for countless eons and surpassed almost all other [[Fontemer Aberrant]]s. The {{Color|help|twin molten horns}} located high up on its body are {{Color|help|Pyro-aligned}} organs that can unleash more vicious elemental attacks and grant it even stronger defensive capabilities. When the Armored Crablord unleashes certain attacks, its twin molten horns are {{Color|help|closer to the ground}}. This provides for a great opportunity to use {{Color|help|Elemental Reactions}} to remove the Pyro element within.
