==Trivia==
*{{Lang|{{w|Tamanooya-no-Mikoto|Tamano'oya}}|ja=玉祖}} is the name of a god in Shinto. The Japanese mythology says he created the jewel Yasakani no Magatama, one of the Three {{w|Imperial Regalia of Japan}}.
** One of his alternate names is {{Lang|mini=1|ja=天櫛明玉命|ja_rm=Amanokushi-Akarutama-no-Mikoto}}.
*The Japanese and Chinese names of the talent translate to {{Lang|"Beautiful Comb in a Box"|ja=葛籠の中の玉櫛|ja_rm=Tsudzura no Naka no Tamakushi|zh=匣中玉栉|zh_rm=Xiá Zhōng Yùzhì}}.
**{{Lang|''Tamakushi''|ja=玉櫛|ja_tl=beatutiful comb}} and {{Lang|''tamakushige''|ja=玉匣|ja_tl=beautiful comb box}} (also written as {{Lang|mini=1|ja=玉櫛笥}} and {{Lang|mini=1|ja=玉篋}}) are old Japanese poetic words commonly appeared in ''{{w|Man'yōshū|Man'youshuu}}'' (compiled in 759), the oldest extant poetry collection in Japan. For example, one poem from ''Man'youshuu'' says that the sea god Watatsumi's daughter (the goddess {{w|Oto-hime}}), who may have inspired Kokomi's design, presented a forbidden ''tamakushige'' (beautiful comb box), later known as the {{w|Tamatebako}}, to her mortal lover {{w|Urashima Tarō|Urashima Tarou}}.<ref>University of Virginia: [https://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/manyoshu/Man9Yos.html {{Zh|詠水江浦嶋子一首}}]<br />'''''Book 9, Poem 1740:''' (...) {{Zh|家はあらむと 玉櫛笥 少し開くに}} (...)''</ref>
**{{Lang|''The Beautiful Comb Box''|ja=玉くしげ|ja_rm=Tamakushige}} is also the name of a political philosophy book written by the Japanese scholar {{w|Motoori Norinaga|Moto'ori Norinaga}} (1730–1801), whose nationalist idea to support emperors (rather than shoguns) was one of the main causes of the downfall of the last shogunate in 1868. The reference may be related to the resistance activity against the shogunate led by Kokomi.
