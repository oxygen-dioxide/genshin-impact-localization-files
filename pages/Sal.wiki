==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sal:''' Work hard, save up, and life will go on.
:{{DIcon}} Save up money for what?
::'''Sal:''' For my dream, which is to open up my very own shop. It doesn't need to be big, it just needs to make enough money for me to get by on.
::'''Sal:''' I'm used to hard labor and have a decent enough head for business. Not that I hope to be as promising as [[Jut]]. All I want is a stable life.
::'''Sal:''' A lot of cargo ships have been coming in and out of Sumeru lately. Those merchants from Snezhnaya are especially willing to spend money to have workers move their goods.
::'''Sal:''' If this keeps up, it shouldn't be long before my dream of opening up a store can become a reality.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Good luck to you.
::'''Sal:''' Thank you.
::'''Sal:''' Workers like us have endless energy! I'm keeping my feet on the ground. Even if I don't reach the stars, I'll still be something one day.
::'''Sal:''' After my business is up and running, I'll give you a discount when you drop by.
:;(Obtain [[Teachings of Praxis]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sal:''' Yeah, see you.
