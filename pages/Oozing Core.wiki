'''Oozing Cores''' are [[Abyss]]al constructs found in the [[Ancient Sacred Mountain]] area of [[Natlan]]. They are capable of floating through the air and often occur in multiples.

Oozing Cores will continuously fire balls of Abyssal energy at nearby entities, and can only be destroyed with a [[Tatankasaur]]'s Spirited charge or an explosion of [[Phlogiston]], such as those caused by [[Flamegranate]]s and [[Tutorial/Unstable Phlogiston Crystals...|Unstable Phlogiston Crystals]]. 

They are usually found near a type of dark mud, which continuously drains the [[HP]] of characters within it. The mud also prevents the player from [[sprinting]], though [[Tepetlisaur]]s, Tatankasaurs, and their associated tribesmembers are resistant to this effect.
