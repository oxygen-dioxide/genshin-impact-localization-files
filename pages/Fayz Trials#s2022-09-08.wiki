{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Fayz Trials 1.png
|text1  = Defeating opponents in combat will grant Fayz Tinctures that will accumulate up to a certain point where they can be used to enter Time Dilation mode. You can accumulate up to 3 uses of the Fayz Potion at any one time.
|image2 = Tutorial Fayz Trials 2.png
|text2  = After you use the Fayz Potion and enter Time Dilation mode, you can use your Viewfinder to capture your opponent's weaknesses and use Supersense Skill. When you have captured over 8 such weaknesses, you can unleash buffed Supersense Skill.
|image3 = Tutorial Fayz Trials 3.png
|text3  = Different opponents have a different number of Weaknesses on them. Some opponents have golden Critical Weaknesses. The buffs you will get from spotting 1 Critical Weakness are equivalent to that which you will get from spotting 2 normal Weaknesses. If you exit Time Dilation without spotting any Weaknesses, you will not use up any Fayz Potions.
