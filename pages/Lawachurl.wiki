{{Description|A Mitachurl that has mutated due to an accumulation of a large amount of elements in its body. They are bigger, stronger, and absolutely ferocious.<br />Hilichurls worship no gods and follow no order or discipline. The strongest and the most ferocious one among them is seen as fit to lead the tribe.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
{{Description|These powerful Hilichurls are called "Lawa" by the rest of the tribe, a respectful form of address best translated to mean "king" or "chief". However, Lawa don't actually rule over or lead the tribe at all. Rather, these large loners prefer solitude, avoiding the looks of reverence from the smaller Hilichurls.<br /><br />Adventurers very rarely encounter these gigantic creatures. Still, even the most seasoned adventurers will think twice before going on expeditions into areas where these dangerous Lawas may be roaming.|[[Hilichurl Cultural Customs|Hilichurl Cultural Customs - Vol. 3]]}}
'''Lawachurls''', also known as "'''Hilichurl Chieftains'''", are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group. They are mutated [[Mitachurls]] that stand atop the [[Hilichurl]] hierarchy.

In combat, Lawachurls will enter an enhanced state and obtain an elemental [[Shield/Enemy|Shield]], enabling them to use more aggressive and high-damage attacks. The shield will naturally decay and can be further damaged to speed up the process. When the shield is destroyed, the enhanced state will end, causing the Lawachurl's attacks to become significantly weaker.
