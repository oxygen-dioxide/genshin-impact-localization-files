'''Tornadoes''' ''(unofficial name)'' are a type of [[Obstacle]] that draws the player in, deals damage, and then throws them out. They currently can only be encountered in [[Stormterror's Lair]] during Archon Quest, Prologue: Act Three - [[Song of the Dragon and Freedom]]. They randomly appear throughout the area and disappear after some time.

==Notes==
* Tornadoes have a large [[Vacuum Field]] around them which slowly draws in players within a 40m radius.
* If the player is less than 6m from the center of the tornado, the player will enter a "flailing" animation and is picked up into the air by the tornado for a short period of time.
* After being picked up, the player may be dealt {{Color|Physical DMG}} until the tornado disappears and throws them away from the center.
** Whether DMG is dealt at all or how many times DMG is dealt is inconsistent.
** Sometimes, instead of being thrown out, the player can become stuck inside the tornado, in which case teleportation may be necessary to escape.
* Enemies can also be drawn into and lifted by the Tornado.

==Locations==
* [[Stormterror's Lair]]
** Only during Archon Quest, Prologue: Act Three - [[Song of the Dragon and Freedom]]
