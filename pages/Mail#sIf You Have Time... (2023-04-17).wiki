|text    = ﻿I paid a visit to [[Moon Carver]] today.

He was immediately alarmed and asked me if something important happened.

...I was simply following your advice and met up with an old friend I haven't seen in a while.

As you know, I'm not the sociable type, so it took quite some explaining before I managed to clear his suspicion. I wasn't prepared to hear him say that... "Since you're here, why don't we ask [[Cloud Retainer]] to host a little get-together?"

In the past, I might've refused. But compared to the reasons for the gathering, the taste of the food, or how the atmosphere feels like... I think of the people by my side as more important. Having you around would make even [[Qingxin]] feel like a treat.

If you have time, would you like to come join us?
