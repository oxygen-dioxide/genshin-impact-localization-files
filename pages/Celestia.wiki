'''Celestia''' is a mysterious location that very few people understand. It is the floating island that can be seen in the sky above [[Teyvat]], and the residence of the [[gods]].

It is said that only mortals who perform great, heroic feats can ascend to Celestia and achieve godhood, where they will watch over their people from above.<ref name="Edith">{{Ref/NPC|Dr. Edith}}</ref> A human with a [[Vision]] is an [[allogene]] &mdash; one with the potential to reach godhood.<ref name="ending note">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref>

So far, only two people are said to have ascended to Celestia: [[Vennessa]] and [[Guhua]].

==Appearance==
The floating "island" actually seems comprised of several landmasses, with one large central rock and about seven to eight smaller "satellites" positioned around it. These outer rocks are connected with one single ring-like structure which again is held in place with several bridges or arches expanding from the central mass.

[[File:Manga C0 Celestia's Central Spire.jpg|thumb|left|<center>The interior of the central spire, as seen during [[Vennessa]]'s ascension. (From the manga ''"Prologue: Songs of the Wind"'' [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga/detail/71 p.71])</center>]]
All of these foundation rocks appear almost as if torn from the earth at some point in the past, with their surfaces covered in lush plains and forests contrasting the rough, craggy undersides. While a few signs of architecture are visible on the outer rocks, the main focus lies on the central mass, with two discernible structures made out of marble or similar white stone. The first is a smaller spire-topped structure positioned on the rim of the central mass, while the second is the more prominent central multi-storied spire which itself is topped by a massive golden construct, reminiscent of an astrolabe.

Additionally, the architecture of the central mass seems to descend deep below the surface level with a distinct inverted dome peeking out from the very bottom of the rock.

Apart from the mentioned forests and green plains on the upper surfaces of the land masses, it also appears to have several subterranean rivers bursting forth from the rock, gradually diminishing into nothing during their free fall of hundreds of miles from above the ground.

While the overall appearance is still imposing and breathtaking, even at a distance, slight traces of disrepair and wear are noticeable among the bright marble structures with broken-off pieces on the spires and bridges.

A depiction of Celestia can also be found on [[Tsurumi Island]] located in a cave below [[Shirikoro Peak]].

[[Venti]] claims the water in Celestia tastes foul and their fruit is bland.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Ref/VO|Venti|More About Venti: IV}}</ref>

===Position in the Sky===
Celestia, from [[Qingyun Peak]] is seen to the northwest, from [[Khaj-Nisut]] is roughly northeast, and from [[Stormterror's Lair]] is roughly west.

In previous versions of the game, Celestia was represented by a single, semi-transparent image, tilted slightly downwards, facing Mondstadt directly. Because of this its appearance changed, depending on where it was viewed from.  From Stormterror's Lair it was almost horizontal, but from Qingyun Peak it appeared heavily tilted. It does not move in the sky like the moon or sun.

As of [[Version 3.0]], it appears as though Celestia is a 3D model that can be viewed from different angles.

Contrary to popular belief, Celestia does not shift positions every update.

==Location and Height==
Celestia is to the west of Mondstadt, to the northwest of Liyue, and to the north of Sumeru. The closest place to Celestia available in game is in the west of [[Minlin]]. The latitude of Celestia is almost the same as [[Musk Reef]].

As of Version 3.0, Celestia's position was changed for the first time, coinciding with the shift to a 3D model. It can now be observed at the same latitude as the Spiral Abyss while facing west. Its longitude appears to be close to that of the Sumeru Akademiya. This longitude appears to be more to the west than previous estimation.

From various methods, players can measure the location and the height of Celestia. However, the measurements may have a large margin of error.

===Before Version 3.0===
Before Version 3.0, Celestia was to the west of Stormterror's Lair, and to the northwest of Qingce Village. The closest place to Celestia available in game was in the west of Bishui Plain and the latitude of Celestia was almost the same as Anemo Hypostasis.

==Relationship to Teyvat==

{{Quote|In other, distant worlds...<br />Pangu gave his blood to form the rivers and seas...<br />The gods sacrificed Purusha and cut his body to pieces...<br />...And then fashioned all living beings with those parts.<br />The brain of the giant Ymir became clouds.<br />Their sacrifices seeded life in the unliving cosmos.<br />These songs sing of the primeval ones.|[[Venti]], in response to [[Traveler|Aether]]'s question about Celestia and godhood in the [[manga]].<ref name="manga">{{Ref/Manga|0}}</ref>}}

Celestia and those who dwell on it are an enigma to the people of Teyvat. Most people believe it is where chosen mortals ascend to become gods (or in Liyue belief, [[adepti]]) and watch over those on Teyvat.<ref name="Edith" /><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Qingzhou}}</ref>

Due to the amount of mystery surrounding this island, different accounts about how Celestia operates, and who qualifies for godhood and how, vary significantly. For example, some believe that adepti descended from Celestia and return there when they depart from this world;<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Musheng}}</ref> whilst other sources believe that [[Guhua]], an adeptus, ascended to Celestia instead of dying.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Rainslasher}}</ref>

When speaking about [[Vennessa]], the Falcon of the West of the [[Four Winds]] who supposedly ascended to Celestia, [[Dainsleif]] claims "it ultimately does naught but hover under the light of the gods,"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Bough Keeper: Dainsleif}}</ref> suggesting that even those who ascend to godhood are still considered beneath the Celestial gods, and not as equals.

In the distant past, humans were able to communicate with Celestia directly through heavenly messengers.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Prayers to Springtime}}</ref> The ancient civilization of [[Sal Vindagnyr]] was one such example, based on the [[Mural Room]]. For reasons unknown, Sal Vindagnyr was eventually destroyed by Celestia itself when they dropped the [[Skyfrost Nail]], destroying the nation's [[Irminsul]] tree and shrouding the region with unrelenting blizzards. Their heavenly messenger no longer responded to them, and their head priest's attempt to find answers ended in vain.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Priest's Box}}</ref>

Another nail similar to the one in Dragonspine would also be found in the deepest parts of [[The Chasm]]. There is also an inverted building between the [[Nameless Ruins]] and [[Stony Halls]] which Dainsleif surmised to be even older than that of Khaenri'ah. Based on the actions at Sal Vindagnyr, whatever civilization that resided in the Chasm was also destroyed by Celestia.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Locked Gate in the Nameless Ruins|note=Dialogue of Skeld, Roneth and Hyglacg}}</ref>

==Relationship to the Archons==
The [[The Seven|Seven Archons]] can resonate directly with Celestia through their [[Gnosis|Gnoses]].<ref name="ending note" />

The prevailing belief among scholars in Teyvat is that Celestia instigated the [[Archon War]] and established the rules of the war.<ref name="TLTF">{{Ref/Quest|Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief}}</ref> It is unclear whether the gods fought to claim one of seven divine seats in Celestia<ref name="TLTF" /> or if they already had seats in Celestia and lost them upon death,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|4|quote=With the crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity, a new god was born.}}</ref> but at the end of the Archon War, the Seven Archons were established out of the victors.

However, the Archons currently seem to have a strained relationship to Celestia at best. Venti constantly avoids the subject, giving cryptic responses whenever asked and growing visibly uncomfortable whenever it is brought up in the manga.<ref name="ReferenceB" /><ref name="manga" /> Zhongli describes the erosion he has endured, such as sealing away [[Azhdaha]], as something "imposed on [him] by the Heavenly Principles."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref> In the Teyvat Chapter Storyline Trailer, [[Dainsleif]] says that the [[God of Justice]] "knows not to make an enemy of the divine," while the [[Tsaritsa]] is planning a "rebellion against the divine" &mdash; which may be why she seeks to take the other Archons' Gnoses. [[Ei]], who inherited the position of Electro Archon from her sister [[Makoto]] after her death during the [[cataclysm]], cut off all ties with Celestia.<ref name="wishes quest">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref> Nahida exchanges her Gnosis for the "secret" of the world in her deal with Il Dottore, indicating she values knowledge above loyalty to Celestia.

==The Heavenly Principles==
Celestia appears to either have established or act in accordance with the {{Lang|"heavenly principles"|zh={{wt|天理||Chinese}}|zh_tl=heavenly principles, natural order}}, also translated as "destiny" or "the divine." When the [[Unknown God]] confronts the Traveler and their sibling, she calls herself the {{Lang|"sustainer of heavenly principles"|zh=天理的维系者}}, and the term "Heavenly Principles" is often used as a synonym for Celestia. These heavenly principles are also intricately linked to the "truth of this world."

[[Erosion]], or a person's gradual degression over time, is stated to be part of the "natural order." [[Zhongli]] suggests that the erosion he has suffered was "imposed on [him] by the Heavenly Principles."<ref name="ReferenceA" />

Nahida states that the Heavenly Principles have been silent since the cataclysm, and theorizes that they may be "awakened" if a Gnosis were to be destroyed; as the Gnoses symbolize their control over Teyvat and its "laws."<ref name="WTBOCL">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref>

===Role in the Cataclysm===
{{main|Cataclysm}}
The driving conflict in the Teyvat Chapter is the role of the heavenly principles during the cataclysm 500 years ago. The ancient kingdom of [[Khaenri'ah]] was destroyed by the gods<ref name="AQ1-4-3">{{Ref/Quest|Dishonorable Trial}}</ref> for reasons related to destiny and the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="wishes quest" /> After the kingdom fell, its people were cursed; Dainsleif was cursed to wander the world as an immortal being, while many of the people became monsters. These monsters banded together to become the [[Abyss Order]], which seeks to topple the divine thrones and destroy Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref> The [[hilichurl]] tribe known as the Eclipse Tribe also seems to have some relation to Khaenri'ah, sharing its name with the kingdom's [[Eclipse Dynasty]].

The fall of Khaenri'ah came at the consternation of several of The Seven themselves, despite their involvement on Celestia's behalf.<ref name="AQ1-4-3" /> The [[Tsaritsa]] formed the [[Fatui]] to challenge the "foundational principles of the world"<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Mocking Mask}}</ref> and rebel against "the divine." To that end, the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] seek to obtain the Gnoses, through force or otherwise. Zhongli willingly surrendered his Gnosis after the people of Liyue passed his test to see whether they could survive without a god,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> tacitly granting his approval of her goal. Ei's ideal of "eternity" was cemented after she witnessed Khaenri'ah "lose everything to the heavenly principles," during which her twin sister [[Makoto]] also perished; she gave up her Gnosis soon afterwards and cut ties with Celestia.<ref name="wishes quest" /><ref group="Note">In [[The Servant's Path]], [[Yae Miko]] says that Ei never said goodbye to Miko before entering the Plane of Euthymia. In [[The Omnipresent God]], Yae Miko states that Ei has been in the Plane of Euthymia for centuries. This places the handing of the Gnosis to Yae Miko several centuries ago.</ref>

==Trivia==
* In {{w|Gnosticism}}, above the seven heavens (worlds) presided over by the {{w|Archon (Gnosticism)|seven archons}} is the {{w|Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad}}, a supercelestial region which mortals aspire to reach through {{w|gnosis}}.
** Celestia and its gods may also be inspired by the {{w|Demiurge}} who, in Gnostic beliefs, fashioned and maintains the material universe; he created the seven heavens and created the seven archons to rule over them. The Demiurge himself is the son of {{w|Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia}}, one of the aspects of {{w|Pleroma}}, but is ignorant of an even-higher existence and thus came to believe himself to be the one and only god. In some Gnostic beliefs, the Demiurge is an antagonistic figure that seeks to prevent mortals from leaving the material universe and ascending to Ogdoad via gnosis.
* When Venti dodges The Traveler's question about whether those who ascend to Celestia truly become gods, the names he mentions &mdash; {{w|Pangu}}, {{w|Purusha}}, and {{w|Ymir}} &mdash; are names of mythological figures connected to creation myths. A common thread between these three figures is that after their deaths, their body parts were scattered to create the world.
* Before Version 3.0, Celestia was not visible in [[Inazuma]] and the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]]. After the Version 3.0 update, Celestia is visible from all areas of Inazuma except for most of the subareas on [[Seirai Island]], likely due to the island's purple sky. It is currently unknown whether Celestia will also become visible in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]].
** It was speculated before Version 3.0 that this was either due to a rendering issue or the fact that neither location has a connection to Celestia, as the Golden Apple Archipelago is no longer inhabited and Ei, Inazuma's archon, severed ties with Celestia.
* At the base of the [[Anemo Archon Statue]] in Mondstadt, the words "Gateway to Celestia" can be seen in [[Teyvat Language|Teyvat's common language]].
