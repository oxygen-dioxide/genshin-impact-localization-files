{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Consigliere:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Err, hello?
::{{DIcon}} That's right, you can't talk...
:::{{DIcon}} But are you really an ordinary, run-of-the-mill Tent Tortoise?
::::{{DIcon}} Hah. What am I doing, expecting a reply like this...
:::::{{DIcon}} Ah, but then again, there can be no disappointment without expectations, right?
::::::{{DIcon}} Thank you. This is, indeed, a truth to be held self-evident.
:::{{DIcon}} Why are you here?
::::{{DIcon}} Do you not know, either?
:::::{{DIcon}} Just like how I don't know why I'm here either?
::::::{{DIcon}} ...Perhaps I should leave now, yes?
::{{DIcon}} You won't even so much as call out to me.
:::{{DIcon}} Does your silence indicate displeasure?
::::{{DIcon}} Is it too much to ask to expect you to make some noise?
:::::{{DIcon}} Alright then. In that case, I humbly beg your forgiveness.
::::::{{DIcon}} Impressive. You have won my respect...
;(Available on all dialogue prompts)
:{{DIcon}} Heh. Never mind. Why am I talking to a Tent Tortoise, anyway...
