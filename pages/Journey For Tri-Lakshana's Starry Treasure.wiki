{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the star-shaped drawing for the first time)<!--even after completing a location-->
:'''Paimon:''' What's this strange pattern here? Is it a drawing or something? Paimon wonders what it's used for...

;(Approach the first location)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, look! There is a weird-looking plant over there...
:'''Paimon:''' And there's so many Pyro Slimes around. They might set the plant on fire! We'd better go check on it!

;(After completing the first location's challenge)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? The drawing lit up! It seems to be pointing in a certain direction...

;(Approach the star-shaped drawing before all lines are lit up)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, (Traveler), the illuminated part of the drawing is identical to the one near the weird-looking plant.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, will something good happen once we've lit up all the drawings?

;(Approach the second location)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, it's one of those strange plants again. Why are those Pyro Slimes gathering around it?

;(After completing the second location's challenge)
:'''Paimon:''' Great! The drawing lit up! It seems to be pointing at a certain direction...

;(Approach the third location)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, (Traveler), that's one of those shape-shifting plants!

;(After completing the third location's challenge)
:'''Paimon:''' Mm, as expected, every time we complete a challenge, a drawing will light up! The pattern on it seems to be pointing at a certain direction...
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't we go in the direction it indicates? We might stumble upon some treasures!

;(Approach the star-shaped drawing)
:'''Paimon:''' We've lit up all the drawings! It looks quite nice!
:'''Paimon:''' Are we gonna find any treasure! Hurry, (Traveler), let's go check it out!
