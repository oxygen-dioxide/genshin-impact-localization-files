==Trivia==
* According to [[Nahida]], the Shroomboar originated because a [[Forest Boar]] fell in love with a [[Shroom-Kin]], and the Forest Boar changed its form to ensure the Shroom-Kin's survival. She describes this as an example of "acting irrationally to pursue [one's] interests."<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Nahida}}</ref>
