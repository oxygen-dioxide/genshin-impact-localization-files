|description = A forest boar that dwells in the rainforest. This creature has developed a certain marvelous symbiosis with the Shroom-Kin. According to researchers' studies, Shroomboars rely on the parasitic mushrooms perched on them for natural camouflage, which allows them to evade predators and survive in the jungles. However, this has also made it popular on the dinner table as naturally-occurring pre-made food.

==Trivia==
* According to [[Nahida]], the Shroomboar originated because a [[Forest Boar]] fell in love with a [[Shroom-Kin]], and the Forest Boar changed its form to ensure the Shroom-Kin's survival. She describes this as an example of "acting irrationally to pursue [one's] interests."<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Nahida}}</ref>
* According to one rumour, the mushrooms gradually eat away at the boar while they grow, and the boar's meat gains a unique mushroom aroma and becomes expensive.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Short Encounter with a Rare Bird}}</ref>
