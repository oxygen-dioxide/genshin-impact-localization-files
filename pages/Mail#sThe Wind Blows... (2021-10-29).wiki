|text    = Lately, the weather has been clear without much rain, which makes it suitable for an outing. During my spare time, I've traversed the hills and fields and saw trees with golden leaves. Looking at this beautiful scenery, one can not help but think: although spring flowers are beautiful, autumn leaves also have their own beauty. These kinds of sights are quite different from those of my [[Inazuma|homeland]].

But the mournful voice of the bird is a pitiful thing. It is accustomed to wandering, but yearns for a permanent harbor. It is only human to gravitate towards light and warmth.

Indeed, the morning winds tell me of an auspicious visitor today. I have prepared some tea in advance and would greatly appreciate it if you would stay for dinner, so I could roast a fish for both of us. This is one of my favorite seafood dishes. A little simple and rustic, but I hope it is to your taste.

Since the wind tells me of your coming, follow its direction as it holds the key to our "fate".
