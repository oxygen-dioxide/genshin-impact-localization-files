==Overview==
While riding it, the player can use two types of weapons: the Swiftstrike and Heavy Cannons. The Swiftstrike, which replaces the player's Normal Attack, has a 1-second [[cooldown]] and deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} when fired. The Heavy Cannon, which replaces the player's Elemental Skill, launches a bomb that explodes dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. It has a 15-second cooldown. Both attacks can be used to [[damage]] [[enemies]] and take down certain submerged [[Hilichurl Structures]].

The player can also speed up the boat to consume an amount of engine [[stamina]]. Its stamina is independent of the player's stamina. Stamina regeneration is also independent; the Waverider's stamina will continue to regenerate even when the player is not riding it, and the player's stamina will continue to regenerate while riding the Waverider. If the stamina is fully depleted, it will not cause death; the Waverider can continue to move at a normal speed, similar to what happens when the player runs out of stamina while sprinting on land.

The Waverider will have a certain level and amount of [[HP]] (e.g. Lv. 90 with 42821 HP). Using the [[Waverider Repair Toolbox]] gadget will restore '''50%''' of its HP. If the Waverider reaches 0 HP, the player will be ejected from it. The player can also self-eject by holding the spacebar. When the Waverider is not taking damage, once every 2 seconds, it will heal '''5%''' Max HP if a player is inside or '''0.65%''' Max HP if empty.

The player cannot take damage while inside the Waverider, including from Ley Line Disorders. Only the Waverider can be destroyed.

Ejecting from the Waverider will cause the player to shoot into the sky while gliding.

While sailing, if one steers too far off course into the [[fog]], they will automatically return to the last activated [[Glimmering Beacon]].

==Trivia==
* Previous to [[Version 2.4]], it was impossible to use the Waverider outside of either the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] (in [[Version 1.6]]) or [[Inazuma]]. However, during the [[Fleeting Colors in Flight#Theme 2: The Great Gathering|The Great Gathering]] [[Events|event]], it was possible to use the Waverider in [[Guyun Stone Forest]]. Despite this, if the player attempted to leave the area, a popup would occur that states the player is leaving the quest area; they would then be teleported to just outside the [[Alcor]].
* As of [[Version/2.5|Version 2.5]], upon completion of the Story Quest [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter|Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter Act II]]: [[Transient Dreams]], the Waverider can be taken out of Inazuma to anywhere in Teyvat. However, Waverider waypoints only exist in Inazuma for the time being.
* The Wavesplitter is a small watercraft that is very similar to the Waverider. It is used by  [[The Crux]] as a small transport and attack craft; it is carried onboard and launched from the [[Alcor]]. Its colour scheme differs from that of the Waverider, with red, blue, and gold highlights that echo the colour scheme of the Alcor. Currently, it can only be used during [[Beidou]]'s Hangout Event Act I: [[When the Crux Shines Bright]], during Training: The Spear of the Crux quest line (in a time trial event).
* [[Miitoboru]] is an event-exclusive NPC that takes the form of a Waverider during [[Summertime Odyssey]]. Miitoboru's dialogue indicates that when the player uses the Waverider in the Golden Apple Archipelago, they are sailing him.
