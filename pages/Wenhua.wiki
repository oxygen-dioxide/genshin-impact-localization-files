==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Wenhua:''' That [[Tusheng]] kid's pretty quick on the uptake...
:{{DIcon}} How's things with your [[Shaggy Sumpter Beast|Sumpter Beasts]]?
::'''Wenhua:''' Well, very well! Chili and Yun have both put on quite some weight, and they're much stronger now.
::'''Wenhua:''' Don't tell him this, but Tusheng's pretty good. His Sumpter Beast feed's quite popular with them both.
::'''Wenhua:''' He's quite the hardworking one, too. Works from early till late preparing the feed, and he doesn't miss a beat.
::'''Wenhua:''' He's different from those other [[Treasure Hoarders]], I'll tell you that!
::'''Wenhua:''' But seriously, why did he join them for, with a pair of hands as diligent as his... I suppose that's bad company for you...
::'''Wenhua:''' In which case, I suppose that makes it my duty to steer him back onto the right path!
::{{DIcon}} Seems like you two are getting along better nowadays...
::'''Wenhua:''' Me? And that Tusheng? Hahaha! You sure are funny. Look, I'm just an old fellow giving him food, board, and a salary out of the goodness of my heart. And he's turned out quite good at toughing his job out.
::'''Wenhua:''' In short, it's a boss-employee relationship, alright? Just that.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm. Where's [[Mingli]]?
::'''Wenhua:''' Oh, him? I got him to buy some pastries while I was delivering my goods, so he's gone to a roadside pavilion to wait for me.
::'''Wenhua:''' He...
::'''Wenhua:''' Oh, drat! I forgot all about him! Tusheng, Tusheng, quickly, go get that fellow. He's probably still in the pavilion!
:{{DIcon}} See you later.
::'''Wenhua:''' Stay safe! I've got to go take care of Chili and Yun.
