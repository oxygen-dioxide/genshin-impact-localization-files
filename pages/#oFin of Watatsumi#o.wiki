==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You must first break the five seals on Watatsumi Island if you wish to enter Enkanomiya.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On approaching the "Fin")
:'''Paimon:''' This must be the "Fin" that Tsuyuko was talking about!
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|An ancient stone tablet stands beside the shrine. Will there be anything of use written on it?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On examining the tablet nearby)
:'''Ancient Stone Tablet:''' "For the retainers of other lands shall come from abroad..."
:'''Ancient Stone Tablet:''' "...The two greet each other like scale and fin, like thigh and bone, ever connected, aiding in our great Omikami's rule..."
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, "the two greet each other," huh... Maybe this means that we need to pair off those fish statues we saw before so they face the center of those big discs?
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, now Paimon's hungry for fish...
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|With the help of the stone tablet's instructions, perhaps breaking the shrine seal will not be a problem... Right?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(While rotating one of the statues)
:'''Paimon:''' That fish over there also moved!

;(After solving the puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Look! The seal is broken! Let's go eat some fish!
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|You have finally broken the shrine's seal, and the Spirit Pearl is yours to claim. Go forth and take it!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On examining the shrine - if this was the first shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' We found a pearl. Is this the Spirit Pearl Tsuyuko talked about?

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the second shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' There's another Spirit Pearl!

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the third shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' And that's a third! We're getting close!

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the fourth shrine)
