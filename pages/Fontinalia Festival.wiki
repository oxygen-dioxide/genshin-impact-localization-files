The '''Fontinalia Festival''' is a festival in [[Fontaine]] to commemorate the [[Lochknight]]s' search for the [[Oceanid]]s and recovery of [[Egeria]].

During the event ''[[Roses and Muskets]]'', the '''Fontinalia Film Festival''' was a new event added by the Fontaine Film Association.

==Overview==
According to legend, the Lochknights went on a quest to search for the Oceanids and eventually welcomed the [[Hydro Archon]], Egeria, to Fontaine. The Fontinalia Festival was established to commemorate the legendary Lochknights by putting on special costumes, raising golden cups, and going door-to-door asking for pure water.<ref name="The Crack of Muskets Breaking the Silence">{{Ref/Quest|The Crack of Muskets Breaking the Silence (Quest)}}</ref>

In recent years, [[Furina]] changed the festivities to become akin to a carnival, replacing the segments about "pure water" with candy. Since then, the festival has become quite popular among kids, who say "Trial or treat!" at each house they visit.<ref name="The Crack of Muskets Breaking the Silence" />

===Fontinalia Film Festival===
The Fontinalia Film Festival was organized by the Fontaine Film Association to introduce the art of cinematography to the public. People may submit films to be evaluated, and the entry with the highest score will be given the "Furina Award" by the Fontaine Film Association. While the award was named while Furina was still ruling Fontaine, nobody moved to change the name after she abdicated following the events of {{Quest|Masquerade of the Guilty}}.<ref name="The Crack of Muskets Breaking the Silence" />

''The Two Musketeers'' by the Musketeer Pictures company, produced by [[Xavier]] and directed by Furina herself, won the first Furina Award.<ref name="The Two Musketeers' Triumph">{{Ref/Quest|The Two Musketeers' Triumph (Quest)}}</ref>

==Fontinalia Festival Events==
{{Event History Table|header=There is '''%PAGES%''' [[Flagship Event]] that has corresponded with the Fontinalia Festival.}}

==Trivia==
*The custom of going door-to-door asking for candy is likely based on the real-life custom of {{w|trick-or-treating}} during {{w|Halloween}}.
===Etymology===
*Fontinalia was the name of the Roman festival in honor of {{w|Fontus|Fons}}, the god of springs in ancient Roman religion.
