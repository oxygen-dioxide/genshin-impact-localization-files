==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Peyotli:''' We'd never call a creature like this a "dragon" back in Natlan... But, given that this is Sumeru, I guess it's understandable.
:{{DIcon}} Dragon? What dragon?
::'''Peyotli:''' To be precise, it's a [[Wenut]], not a dragon.
::'''Peyotli:''' But some of the local schools of thought hold that Wenut are a form of dragon that have adapted to the desert environment, evolving, if you will, into what they are today.
::'''Peyotli:''' While I disagree with their conjecture, I must admit it's easy to see why they think this way.
::'''Peyotli:''' Certain plants will present drastically different appearances depending on conditions such as temperature and light, but knowing what we do about the adaptability of dragons, surely they would undergo even more significant changes.
:{{DIcon}} I&mdash;Is that right?
::'''Peyotli:''' Ha, even false theories have their value.
