'''Condensed Ice''' is a [[Ley Line Disorder]] that increases the player's stamina consumption.

It can be removed via [[Elemental Reactions]]. If applied as a domain debuff, the player can also reduce the time affected by the debuff by using an artifact from [[Prayers to Springtime]] or the {{color|Pyro|Fervent Flames}} [[Elemental Resonance]]. However, the duration-shortening methods do not work if the debuff is applied by an enemy.
