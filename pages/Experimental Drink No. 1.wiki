|description  = An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. It is filled with fizzy bubbles, and has a slightly salty flavor...<br>But overall, it still maintains a bit of the orginal Fonta flavor... at least you know what you are drinking is still Fonta.

'''Experimental Drink No. 1''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtainable from the {{Quest|Time to Drink}}.

==How to Obtain==
Experimental Drink No. 1 can be obtained from ''Time to Drink'' by choosing the following dialogue options in the respective encounters in the {{Quest|Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!}}:
* First Encounter: "Just add it, I reckon that a little saltiness will do us good."
* Second Encounter: "I reckon carbonation's for the best."

Subsequent encounters of ''Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!'' past the third do not affect which [[Experimental Drink]] is obtained.
