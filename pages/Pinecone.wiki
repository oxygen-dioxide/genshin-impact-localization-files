'''Pinecones''' are a [[Cooking Ingredient]] found in the wild in [[Teyvat]].

==How to Obtain==
Pinecones are most often found at the base of trees or in critter hideouts throughout Teyvat, and are by far most common in [[Mondstadt]].

==Trivia==
* Despite being Pinecones, they can be found even in areas without [[Pine Wood|Pine Trees]].
*One of the [[Expeditions]] available in [[Sumeru]] rewards Pinecones, despite the complete absence of Pine Trees and Pinecones in the region.
