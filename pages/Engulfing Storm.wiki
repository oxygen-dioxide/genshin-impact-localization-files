}}
'''Engulfing Storm''' is a [[Ley Line Disorder]] that continuously drains your character's [[Energy]].

It can be removed via [[Elemental Reactions]]. If applied as a domain debuff, the player can also reduce the time affected by the debuff by using an artifact from [[Prayers for Wisdom]] or the {{color|Cryo|Shattering Ice}} [[Elemental Resonance]]. However, the duration-shortening methods do not work if the debuff is applied by an enemy.
