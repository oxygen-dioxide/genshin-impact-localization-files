'''Pulcinella,''' also known by his codename "'''The Rooster''',"<ref name="lazzo video description 6" /> is the Fifth of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]<ref name="tart5">{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|Character Story 5}}</ref> and the Mayor of the City of [[Snezhnaya]].<ref>[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ YouTube: Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]</ref>

He makes his first clear appearance during ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'' alongside his fellow Harbingers.

He also appears as a silhouette during [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY ''Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail''] alongside his followers, and they are collectively known as "Pulcinella and followers" as the featured character(s) for Act VI, [[Snezhnaya]].

==Profile==
Little is currently known about Pulcinella beyond his rank and title. Unlike several other Harbingers who were hand-picked for the position by [[Pierro]], [[Tartaglia]] was instead inducted into the Fatui by Pulcinella and worked his way up into the Harbingers.

===Personality===
Little is known about Pulcinella's personality, but he appears to be rather calculating: he correctly predicted that Tartaglia's immense strength and habit of being in the midst of chaos could be used to advance the Fatui's cause while sating his appetite for battle. Pulcinella also gives "cautious counsel" regarding Tartaglia, calling him trustworthy but warning against growing attached to him.<ref name="GIOW">HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/75641 Secrets From the Depths of Winter]</ref> Like the Fatui's overall modus operandi, Pulcinella will not hesitate to sacrifice "less valuable assets" for something he believes to be a greater cause.<ref name="company deep">{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}</ref>

[[Tartaglia]] is unsure of Pulcinella's motivations, but knows that he genuinely cares for him and his family, as he remarks on how [[Tonia]] and [[Teucer]] talk about the pastries and gifts he gives them as they write letters.<ref>[[Tartaglia/Voice-Overs]]: ''About The Rooster''</ref>

===Appearance===
Pulcinella is a white-haired elderly man with white mustache and rounded glasses along with pointy nose and ears. He wears a dark blue longcoat with flared and feathered sleeves over at least a pair of baggy blue trousers and long flared shoes. His coat has a wide feathered collar with some form of hat or headdress with a pair of feathers. He is surrounded by ice, but it is unknown if this implies the possession of a Cryo [[Vision]] or [[Delusion]], or serves as just a visual shorthand for Snezhnaya.

==Story==
When [[Tartaglia]] (then known as Ajax) was 14 years old, he was drawn into the [[Abyss]] and re-emerged greatly changed by the events that transpired there, gaining unmatched combat prowess and an uncanny habit of having chaos follow in his wake. Following several incidents in Tartaglia's hometown village of [[Morepesok]], his worried father brought him to the Fatui in hopes that they could hone his temperament, only to watch as his son easily beat up well-trained soldiers. Tartaglia's unique attributes piqued Pulcinella's curiosity, and he conscripted the boy into the Fatui under the guise of serving the [[Tsaritsa]] as punishment.<ref name="tart5" />

===Present Day===
An indeterminate amount of time ago, [[Signora]] made an agreement with the [[Liyue Qixing]] and dispatched the Ninth Company, which includes some of Pulcinella's men, on an expedition to [[The Chasm]] to explore its depths. Due to the amount of distance between The Chasm and the surface, their supply line with the Fatui stationed in Liyue Harbor was the Ninth Company's only way of getting both supplies and information about the surface.<ref name="company deep" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in a Foreign Land}}</ref>

However, following Tartaglia's actions in Liyue and the revival of [[Osial]], relations between the [[Liyue Qixing]] and the Fatui soured greatly. The Qixing pulled their support from the expedition and forbade the [[Millelith]] from even making contact with the Fatui. With the supply line cut off, the Ninth Company was stranded without even the knowledge of what had occurred. By the time the [[Traveler]] finds them, the Ninth Company's original sixty-four members had been reduced to half its number, was divided into multiple groups, and no longer had a chain of command. [[Anton]], a direct subordinate of Pulcinella's, bemoans that "dispens[ing] with less valuable assets" to achieve a greater goal is the Harbinger's modus operandi.<ref name="company deep" />

==Trivia==
*The Chinese and Japanese descriptions of ''Teyvat Storyline Trailer: Travail'' use both Pulcinella's alias and ''{{w|commedia dell'arte}}'' name, listing him as "Rooster" Pulcinella. This makes him one of three Harbingers whose alias and ''commedia dell'arte'' names are simultaneously used, alongside "Regrator" [[Pantalone]] and "Childe" Tartaglia. However, this is not preserved in other localizations, which use "Pulcinella" as a translation for both his alias and his ''commedia dell'arte'' name.

===Etymology===
* Like the titles of all Fatui Harbingers, {{w|Pulcinella}} is a stock character in ''commedia dell'arte'', an early form of professional theatre originating from Italy. The name ''Pulcinella'' is derived from, or a combination of, either ''pollastrello'' (meaning "rooster") or ''pulcino'' (meaning "chick").<ref>AntonioFava: [https://web.archive.org/web/20170529194534/http://www.antoniofava.com:80/masks "I Servi (The Servants) - Pulcinella"] (Archived)</ref>)
** The stock character is typically depicted as a top-heavy, chicken shaped man who wears a mask with an exaggerated nose.
