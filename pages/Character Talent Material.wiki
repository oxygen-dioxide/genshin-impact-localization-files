'''Character Talent Materials''' are [[materials]] that are used along with [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material]]s and [[Character Level-Up Material]]s to level up a [[Character]]'s talents. Higher quality materials can also be crafted with [[Alchemy]] by combining lower quality materials of the same type. For example:
* {{Item|Teachings of Freedom|30|x=3}} can be combined to create {{Item|Guide to Freedom|30|x=1}}.
* {{Item|Guide to Freedom|30|x=3}} can be combined to create {{Item|Philosophies of Freedom|30|x=1}}.

As some Character Talent Materials look like books (or scrolls), they are commonly referred to as "talent books".

Check each character's page to see which materials are required for their talents or check each materials page to see which characters use that material for leveling talents.

A character must be at Ascension Phase 2 (which requires [[Adventure Rank]] 25) to begin leveling up talents using talent materials.
