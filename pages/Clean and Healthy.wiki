{{Quest Description|Golshan of Bimarstan is worrying about the sanitation conditions in the hospital...}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Golshan, optional)
:'''Golshan:''' (*sigh* I wish I could have a break.)

:'''Golshan:''' *sigh* How will we find anyone who will help at this hour...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Golshan:''' Oh! H&mdash;Hello there, Traveler. Are you here for treatment?
:{{DIcon}} I'm just passing through...
:{{DIcon}} I just noticed that you looked so worried...
:'''Golshan:''' Hehe... Was it that obvious? Well, you are right. I am worried about something.
:'''Golshan:''' I don't know why, but there's been an increasing number of people seeking treatment here at [[Bimarstan]] lately. Our staff have their hands full taking care of the patients.
:'''Golshan:''' Still, Dr. [[Zakariya]] insisted that I find ways to keep the surrounding area clean...
:'''Golshan:''' He said that only if the hospital and patients were kept clean, then they could more easily receive the blessing of the Dendro Archon.
:'''Golshan:''' *sigh* But we can't spare any hands at the moment, and it's not like I can ask the patients with mild symptoms to help out...
:{{DIcon}} How about you leave the cleaning to me?
::'''Golshan:''' You'll help? That's very kind of you! I'll have the payment ready. It's just that... you might have to lower your expectations in that regard.
:{{DIcon}} Can't you just hire someone?
::'''Golshan:''' Few would volunteer to work in a place full of patients. Besides, we don't have the budget to hire that many people.
::'''Golshan:''' Normally we would split the cleaning into shifts, but no one is available right now.
::'''Golshan:''' So, Traveler, could... could you help out?
::'''Golshan:''' We will pay you! It won't be too much though...
::{{DIcon}} What's with the patients here, anyway...
::'''Golshan:''' Most of our patients only suffer from minor ailments, such as headaches.
::'''Golshan:''' Dr. Zakariya has told people many times that these conditions are not as scary as they think, but no one buys his explanations.
::'''Golshan:''' I suppose that it might not be the disease they're afraid of, it's getting sick itself...
::'''Golshan:''' I'll leave the cleaning to you then, Traveler.
:'''Golshan:''' *sigh* May the Dendro Archon keep people safe from sickness...

;(Talk to Golshan again)
:'''Golshan:''' Traveler, is there anything you'd like to ask?
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me more about Zakariya?
::'''Golshan:''' Dr. Zakariya is a great doctor and a devout believer of the [[Dendro Archon]].
::'''Golshan:''' He treats patients around the clock and hardly ever has time to eat.
::'''Golshan:''' Dr. Zakariya even said that it's his duty to extend the blessings of the Dendro Archon to more people.
:{{DIcon}} Does the blessing of the Dendro Archon really matter that much in healing?
::'''Golshan:''' To be precise, the act of "treatment" itself is the blessing of the Dendro Archon.
::'''Golshan:''' It was by the grace of the Dendro Archon that we could find cures for patients and grow herbs to treat illnesses...
::'''Golshan:''' Thank you, O Dendro Archon, for your blessing. May everyone be kept from maladies...
<!--I suspect this commission have several versions... Checked with textmap and indeed there are at least three different versions of this particular dialogues.
So far, 2 editors have had the Mr. Gurgen variant first. 1 editor got the Azra version first-->
;(Report back after cleaning the stains with Anemo or Hydro)
:'''Golshan:''' Have you cleaned up the surrounding area?
:{{DIcon}} Yep.
:'''Golshan:''' I can't thank you enough, Traveler. Please take this as your payment.
;(Golshan will say one of these lines)
::'''Golshan:''' By the way, Mr. [[Gurgen]] has been forcing himself to work again lately. I should take some more time to get him to change his mind...
::'''Golshan:''' By the way, Mr. [[Aftab]] hasn't been following his diet lately. I'll have to discuss his medication with Dr. Zakariya...
::'''Golshan:''' By the way, Ms. [[Azra]] seems a little down lately. Should I ask her about the situation or not...?
:'''Golshan:''' There have been so many things that need taking care of lately, so I might have to bother you with cleanup duties next time as well.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* Golshan's randomized dialogue near the end of the commission is a reference to the commission ''[[Doctor's Orders]]''.
