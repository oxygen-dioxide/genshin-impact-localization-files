|description    = A slender, amphibious fish that has the peculiar habit of warming itself up at shallows or sandbanks.<br>Young unagi tend to be transparent throughout, and will only gain their beautiful vermillion ear-fins and red-and-yellow splotches as they mature. Apart from being used as high-end ingredients, they are also often kept as ornamental fish.<br>Because of their gentle nature, Unagi can live in harmony with all the creatures in the Realm Within, making them some of [[Tubby]]'s favorite companions.
