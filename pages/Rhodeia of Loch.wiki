{{Description|A life-form created from condensed [[Hydro]] elements of incredible purity.<br />Often attached to bodies of water. It is said that as water bodies becomes purer, the Hydro elements within grow more abundant, causing the Oceanids to grow more powerful.<br />It is also said by some that Oceanids were once sea creatures from a home far away who carried the fragments of a long-dead god to the many corners of this world. Perhaps they did this so that the love their god held for this world could be spread through the waters to all the land...|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
===Hydro Mimics===
{{main|Hydro Mimics}}
The Oceanid summons various different water animals that must be fought and defeated in order to harm the boss. There are 8 different types of mimics in total that can be spawned by Oceanid. Each type has a decreased resistance to certain element, apart from Hydro, which they are completely immune to. As with all other Hydro wildlife, they can hover on water.

====Trio Mimics====
These mimics appear three at a time when summoned by Rhodeia. They have decreased {{Color|Electro RES}}. These mimics may only spawn on the corner tiles of the arena.

* [[Hydro Mimic Crane]] &mdash; [[Azure Crane]]-like creatures that attack the player from afar, flapping their wings to create powerful Hydro waves. If approached, they may back off, much like Fatui bracers.
* [[Hydro Mimic Raptor]] &mdash; Flying creatures who swoop down on the player to slash at them with their talons.

====Duo Mimics====
These mimics appear two at a time. There are two groups of these mimics. These mimics may only spawn on the center tile of the arena.

{{Color|Cryo RES}} decreased:
* [[Hydro Mimic Mallard]] &mdash; Ducks with a Hydro vortex underneath them that deals rapid {{Color|Hydro DoT}} to players inside them.
* [[Hydro Mimic Crab]] &mdash; Crabs that tend to walk perpendicularly around the player, spewing bubbles from their claws that deal light but rapid {{Color|Hydro DMG}}. They occasionally stop once in a while to rest before moving on. They have decreased {{Color|Pyro RES}} but can continuously.

{{Color|Pyro RES}} decreased:
* [[Hydro Mimic Boar]] &mdash; Rams the player up close or charges at the player from afar. Continuously heals itself.
* [[Hydro Mimic Ferret]] &mdash; Performs rapid swipes against the player. Continuously heals itself.

====Solo Mimics====
These mimics appear one at a time when summoned by Rhodeia. They have decreased {{Color|Geo RES}}. When killed, they transform into a bomb that covers a wide area and deals massive {{Color|Hydro DMG}} upon detonation. These mimics may only spawn on the edge tiles of the arena.

* [[Hydro Mimic Frog]] &mdash; Frogs that jump and plunge at the player or shoot ranged waves.
* [[Hydro Mimic Finch]] &mdash; Finches primarily attack by jumping and plunging at the player.

===Oceanid===
* '''Sinking Platform:''' After clearing two waves of Hydro Mimics, the Oceanid will select two random tiles in the 3×3 grid, dive upon them, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}} and sinking them. The central arena tile will never be selected and is therefore a safe spot for players to stand on during this ability.
* '''Whirlpool:''' If the Hydro Mimics are not defeated in a certain amount of time, the Oceanid creates a whirlpool below the player that follows them, deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DoT}}, and explodes after a while, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.

==Strategy==
Before starting the fight, having a [[Bow]] or [[Catalyst]] user is highly recommended in case Rhodeia summons raptors, as they are particularly troublesome to hit without them. [[Geo Constructs]] such as [[Zhongli]]'s [[Stone Stele]]s and [[Albedo]]'s [[Solar Isotoma]] skills will not work in the arena.

When the fight is initiated, Rhodeia will summon [[Hydro Mimics]] that imitate wildlife to fight the player on her behalf. These mimics will appear from one of the unsunken tiles that form the arena, and are directly linked to her health; after clearing each wave, she loses health. The first two instances of this are one batch of Hydro Mimics, which varies from the list above.

While each mimic does have varied resistances, all of them are immune to [[Hydro]] attacks. The mimics' permanent Hydro status means that they can be inflicted with [[Vaporize]], [[Electro-Charged]], and [[Frozen]] consistently if said characters are brought onto the field, the former two providing additional DMG, while the latter can take pressure away from some troublesome mimics. Electro attacks should be used with careful consideration, since the player will be wet for the entire battle and may accidentally apply Electro-Charged to themselves if careless.

Geo characters that can cause [[Crystallize]] can be useful since Rhodeia and her mimics only inflict {{Color|Hydro DMG}}. The more troublesome mimics are the Raptors, Finches and Frogs. As stated above, Raptors are incredibly troublesome without Bow or Catalyst users. Finches and Frogs, after being defeated, will transform into a Hydro bomb that deals massive DMG, coupled with an extremely wide reach &mdash; players will need to move away further than the game insists with the [[AoE]] indicator. While possible to run away from it without taking DMG or using a shield to block it, this should only be done by defeating the mimic towards the edges of the arena. It is also possible to jump or [[Plunging Attack|plunge]] into nearby water at the right time so the water bomb explodes while the player is underwater, resulting in no DMG taken.

After the first two waves of mimics have been cleared, Rhodeia will slam two random tiles into the water, except the middle tile, which is always safe. She will then summon two sets of Hydro Mimics for the remainder of the encounter.

When the next two waves of mimics are cleared, she will slam two more random tiles, before summoning two more sets of Hydro Mimics for the last wave. After the last mimic is destroyed, she will fall into the water, defeated.

==Event Variant==
===Rhodeia's Rage===
{{Main|Rhodeia's Rage}}
'''Rhodeia's Rage''' is the boss variant of '''Rhodeia of Loch''' during the event [[Wishful Drops]].

===Hateful Oceanid===
{{Main|Hateful Oceanid}}
The '''Hateful Oceanid''', also known as '''Urania''', is the boss variant of '''Rhodeia of Loch''' during the specific event called [[Legend of the Vagabond Sword]].

==Achievements==
{{Achievement Topic Table|topic=Oceanid}}

==Lore==
Rhodeia is a [[Lochfolk]], who came from the Hydro nation, [[Fontaine]]. She was the greatest and strongest Lochfolk scout admired by many. As a [[Lochfolk]], she swore allegiance to the previous Hydro Archon and lived in the bodies of water of Fontaine, acting as an informant or spy for her [[Archon]] and providing a connection for the people of her land. However, the Lochfolk at large do not agree with the plans and ideals of the current Hydro Archon, the [[God of Justice]], and so refuse to acknowledge or support her.<ref name="endoraII">{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (II)}}</ref>

Wanting for a small haven of tranquil waters, Rhodeia left her hometown and settled into a lake in Bishui, Plain. Sometime after her self-imposed exile, she sensed [[Endora]] who she believed was an assassin sent from Fontaine. Her enmity towards the young lochfolk turned the waters sources on the border between Mondstadt and Liyue bitter.<ref name="endoraI">{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (I)}}</ref>  The bitter water killed fishes and greatly affected  the [[Dawn Winery]] which uses the nearby [[Bishui River|river]] for brewing wine.<ref name="endoraI" /> With the help of the Traveler, Endora faced Rhodeia in a fight and reached an understanding. Still, Rhodeia remains unhappy and is waiting for the pure waters to become corrupted.<ref name="endoraII" />

==Trivia==
*In Greek mythology, the {{w|List of Oceanids|Oceanids}} were the nymph daughters of the Titan Oceanus. Rhodeia (also known as Rhodea or Rhodia) is one of them.
*During [[The First Experiment: Elements|Albedo's Story Quest]], he pronounces Oceanid as "O-'''cee'''-a-nid" (/oʊˈsiːənɪd/), which is an established pronunciation of the mythological being, in addition to "'''Oh'''-shen-id" (/ˈoʊʃənɪd/).
*Unlike the other Normal Bosses which are simply present and become aggressive when approached or attacked, Rhodeia is not initially present in her arena, with the player having to interact with her pool of water to begin the fight. She is also the only Normal Boss that appears in a random spot each time the player comes to challenge her, as said pool of water appears in one of the four corners of her arena.
*When approaching the platform that consists as her arena, the weather will automatically change to rain regardless of the surrounding climate. This special weather will persist until the player leaves the area if she is still present or is defeated.
