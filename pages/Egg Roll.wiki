|desc_suspicious = A fried egg dish. It looks way too soft... and what do you know, it comes apart the instant it so much as touches chopsticks. Might as well use a spoon at this point.
|desc_basic      = A fried egg dish. Beat eggs well, season and fry them slowly in a wok, roll up into a fixed shape. Pour {{Not a typo|our}} egg liquid in again and continue until it has all reached a certain thickness, then get ready to plate up. This is an ordinary yet welcoming Inazuman delicacy.
|desc_delicious  = A fried egg dish. The shape of the dish as a whole, the golden color, the fluffy mouthfeel... a small piece of this may not fill your stomach, but it will fill you with warmth. Not to mention that sweetness that you can almost reach out and touch &mdash; simply irresistible.
