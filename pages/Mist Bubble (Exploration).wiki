'''Mist Bubbles''' are bubbles found in the water. The Mist Bubble is unaffected by player and [[Waverider]] attacks and will only disappear when the player moves above it while [[swimming]] or piloting a Waverider, after which another bubble will appear nearby. Following these bubbles will eventually spawn a [[Floating Crate]] with Mora.
