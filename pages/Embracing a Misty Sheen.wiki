==Trivia==
* <section begin="MtLaixinTheme1" />The following soundtracks share a theme:
** [[Embracing a Misty Sheen]]
** [[Through Ancient Veils]]<section end="MtLaixinTheme1" />
*The Chinese name of both this soundtrack and [[Through Ancient Veils]] reference a poem by Yin Yaofan, recorded in the ''{{W|Complete Tang Poems}}''{{Lang|zh=全唐诗|zh_rm=Quántángshī}}. The poem{{Lang|zh=赠歌人郭婉二首|zh_tl=Two Poems in Dedication of Songgirl Guowan}} reads:
**{{zh|石家金谷舊歌人，起唱花筵淚滿巾。<br>紅粉少年諸弟子，一時惆悵望梁塵。<br>'''雲滿衣裳月滿身'''，輕盈歸步過流塵。<br>五更無限留連意，常恐風花又一春。}}<br>The old songgirl at the {{W|Shi Chong|Shi Family}}'s golden garden, you sang at the glorious feast till tears soaked your handkerchief,<br>The many rosy-cheeked youth disciples, at once were disconsolate watching your moving song.<br>'''Like clouds covering your clothes and the moon showering your body''', your footsteps are lithe across the flying dust,<br>Lingering at the cusp of dawn yet with infinite reluctance, with the fear that the blowing wind and withering flowers will take away another beautiful spring.
