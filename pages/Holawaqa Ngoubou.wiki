|desc_5      = Enters the Golden Flame form, gaining a {{Pyro}} [[Shield/Enemy|shield]] and immunity to all DMG. The transformation expires after '''45''' seconds, but destroying the shield will cause Holawaqa Ngoubou to exit this form early.
* When entering this form, Holawaqa Ngoubou is initially in the '''high-altitude''' state and cannot be hit by melee attacks.
* While in this form, it will alternate between the following two attacks:
** '''Flamewind Feather:''' Fires 2 barrages of feathers at the player, each dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, followed by a larger projectile which deals '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and turns into a Flamewind Feather. The Flamewind Feather is a {{Pyro}} object and can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reaction]]s.
*** In the [[Spiral Abyss]] and the [[Imaginarium Theater]], 2 Flamewind Feathers are spawned.
** '''Dive:''' Dives down towards the summoned Flamewind Feather.
*** If all Flamewind Feathers has been destroyed, deals '''65% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and enters the '''low-altitude''' state, becoming vulnerable to melee attacks.
*** If a Flamewind Feather is still intact, deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} over a larger AoE, and returns to the '''high-altitude''' state.

{{Description|A mutated Qucusaurus that has taken on special powers of great magnitude. It stands tall in battle with its majestic panoply of golden flames.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
{{Description|A Qucusaurus whose body has attained a supernatural form due to enduring forces that the bodies of modern Saurians cannot control.<br>Legends say that when the giant Qucusaur who now often dwells in the mountain fog was young, he also once followed the heroes who saved Natlan in their adventures. It is said that [[Menilek|one of those heroes]] once agreed to make the pilgrimage with him together to the volcano, to save his mind back from the brink of insanity that the increasing violent power in his blood was forcing him towards. However, judging from his current title of "Tyrant," that story did not have a happy ending.|[[Archive]]}}
