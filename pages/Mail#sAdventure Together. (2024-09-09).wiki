|text      = [[Lisa|Master]] says, when friend is in trouble, help them. When I'm in trouble, I go to friend.

Have to talk a lot. Tiring, but worth it.

Friends are like [[Flaming Flower]]s, warm, when together.

You're on an adventure. Worth it, but you tired?

If you are, friends make things better.

I want to go on an adventure, with you.

My claws, stronger now. I hope I can help.
