==Profile==
Tsarevich is a "well-known" merchant from [[Snezhnaya]] who does business all over the seven nations, eventually making his way to Mondstadt for a trade. Due to [[Dadaupa Gorge]] being full of monsters, the [[Knights of Favonius]] prevent him from going through because it is too dangerous, much to his annoyance as they have yet to handle the monsters. He is accompanied by [[Pavel]], his subordinate.

===Personality===
Tsarevich takes pride in his reputation as an acclaimed merchant who does business across Teyvat, but he also comes off as haughty. He does not like the Knights of Favonius, claiming they take too long in removing monsters and insisting that they be the ones to do so, rather than his subordinates.

During his commissions, similarly to [[Viktor]], Tsarevich appreciates a person who goes straight to the point and follows orders as requested, finding such people rare in Mondstadt and paying people "accordingly" based on their conduct. He is also failure-intolerant; he scolds the Traveler whenever there is a mere mistake in complying his orders.

===Appearance===

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tsarevich:''' Come on! How long do you expect a guy to keep waiting, huh!?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Tsarevich:''' There are monsters in the gorge, so the Knights of Favonius wouldn't let me through. Too dangerous, they say.
::'''Tsarevich:''' I've been waiting and waiting, and still no sign that they'll let us through any time soon. I would have expected a little more efficiency from the illustrious Knights of Favonius.
::'''Tsarevich:''' You're an adventurer, huh? Well go on then, get in there and take out a few monsters for me, pronto!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Tsarevich:''' You've never heard the name Tsarevich before? Tsk... I would say I'm surprised, but you are an ignorant country bumpkin after all.
::'''Tsarevich:''' I'm a very well known merchant from Snezhnaya. I do business all over the seven nations. Mondstadt has proven to be the most eye-opening place for me... but don't get the wrong idea. I could not have imagined somewhere so abysmal without seeing it for myself.
::'''Tsarevich:''' People here are so simple-minded, no business sense at all. If you gave me a week, I could raze this whole economic system to the ground.
::'''Tsarevich:''' Then again, I don't know what I was expecting. If people here knew the first thing about business, this place obviously wouldn't be in the sorry state it is today.
::{{DIcon}} Why don't you and your minions go?
::'''Tsarevich:''' Are you joking? Someone like me, getting down and dirty with the monsters? Fat chance.
::'''Tsarevich:''' And my subordinates are under no obligation to make up for the knights' incompetence. They don't work for free. Are the Knights of Favonius going to cover my extra costs?
::'''Tsarevich:''' They're a fickle lot. They're always making things difficult for me getting into the city, too. So now they want to take advantage of me, huh? Dream on!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tsarevich:''' Get rid of those monsters, you hear? I can only wait so long.
