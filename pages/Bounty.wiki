'''Bounties''' are weekly challenges that are unlocked by reaching [[Reputation]] Level 1 (for [[Natlan]] Tribes) or Level 2 (for other regions) in a [[region]] of Teyvat. Completing these bounties will award 60, 80, 100 or 120 Reputation EXP for whichever nation or tribe the player accepted the bounty from. A total of 3 bounties can be completed each week, which is shared between nations and tribes.

Claiming a bounty's rewards will cause another to instantly replace the slot (except in Natlan). It is recommended to do only the 120 EXP (Natlan) and 100 EXP (other regions) bounties to most efficiently garner Reputation EXP through bounties.

Bounties can be done in [[Co-Op Mode]] but with some [[#Co-Op|caveats]].
__TOC__
{{Clr}}
==Mondstadt and Liyue==
When the player accepts one of the bounties from either [[Mondstadt]] or [[Liyue]], a search area will be added to the player maps. Upon reaching the search area, the player will have 10 minutes to find and kill the target. If the bounty is successful, they'll receive 60, 80 or 100 EXP depending on the chosen difficulty.

There are three pieces of evidence the player must find before the target can be found. This evidence can be any combination of an elemental mark on its own, an item with an elemental mark, or a monster with an elemental mark and two accompanying monsters (killing the monster with the mark will despawn the other two if not killed and advance the bounty). While using [[Elemental Sight]] is not required to find the evidence, it is highly recommended as evidence is small, all search areas are large, and some search areas have wildly varying levels of elevation. Every time Elemental Sight is activated, a few meters of a trail to the next piece of evidence will be revealed.

After all three pieces of evidence are found, the player can find the target. Elemental Sight can be used to find the target, though it is not required and may not even be needed.{{Clr}}

==Inazuma, Sumeru and Fontaine==
Bounties in [[Inazuma]], [[Sumeru]], and [[Fontaine]] work far differently compared to those of Mondstadt and Liyue; their rewards are the same, but rather than searching for evidence before-hand, the bounty target appears as soon as the player enters the search area, and with the exception of [[Ruin Grader]] and [[Breacher Primus]] targets, are accompanied by additional enemies.

==Natlan==
In [[Natlan]], bounties reward 80, 100 or 120 EXP and 1, 2 or 3 [[Sanctifying Unction]] respectively. The difficulty and therefore reward is chosen at the bounty site rather than when starting it and affects the Level of enemies, rather than their type. Once the difficulty is chosen, the hunt itself works the same as in Sumeru.

==Co-Op==
Bounties can be initiated and completed while in Co-Op. But the bounty is still a single player event. Co-Op teammates are unable to see traces on the ground (i.e., picking up items related to the bounty: they won't see anything on the ground), and have no indication that a bounty is in the area. However, they are able to help defeat the bounty when it is found.

The same applies to [[Inazuma]], [[Sumeru]], [[Fontaine]] and [[Natlan]], however, because there is no tracing mechanic, the host simply needs to enter the zone for the enemy to spawn. If another player enters the zone while the host is not present, the target will not spawn.

==List of Bounties==
Bounties are divided into three difficulty tiers of 3, 4 or 5 stars.

The below list does '''not apply''' to [[Natlan]], as in Natlan the types of enemies don't depend on the bounty difficulty.

For a detailed list of Bounties with strength/weakness combos, see [[Bounty/List]].
