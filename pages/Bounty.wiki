'''Bounties''' are weekly quests that can be obtained by reaching [[Reputation]] Level 2 in a [[region]] of Teyvat. Completing these bounties will award 60, 80, or 100 Reputation EXP for whichever nation the player accepted the bounty from. A total of 3 bounties can be completed each week, which is shared between nations.

Claiming a bounty's rewards will cause another to instantly replace the slot. It is recommended to do only the 100 EXP bounties to most efficiently garner Reputation EXP through bounties.

Bounties can be done in [[Co-Op Mode]] but with some [[#Co-Op|caveats]].

==Hunting the Target==
===Mondstadt and Liyue===
When the player accepts one of the bounties from either [[Mondstadt]] or [[Liyue]], a search area will be added to the player maps. Upon reaching the search area, the player will have 10 minutes to find and kill the target.

There are three pieces of evidence the player must find before the target can be found. This evidence can be any combination of an elemental mark on its own, an item with an elemental mark, or a monster with an elemental mark and two accompanying monsters (killing the monster with the mark will despawn the other two if not killed and advance the bounty). While using [[Elemental Sight]] is not required to find the evidence, it is highly recommended as evidence is small, all search areas are large, and some search areas have wildly varying levels of elevation. Every time Elemental Sight is activated, a few meters of a trail to the next piece of evidence will be revealed.

After all three pieces of evidence are found, the player can find the target. Elemental Sight can be used to find the target, though it is not required and may not even be needed.{{Clr}}

===Inazuma===
Bounties in [[Inazuma]] work far differently compared to those of Mondstadt and Liyue; rather than searching for evidence before-hand, the bounty target appears as soon as the player enters the search area, and with the exception of [[Ruin Grader]] targets, are accompanied by additional enemies. Apart from the modifiers that Mondstadt and Liyue bounties have, Inazuman targets also have additional effects:

*An extra monster appearing that is of comparable strength to the target ([[Kairagi]] and [[Ruin Sentinel]] targets)
*[[Exploding Barrel]]s all over the area ([[Lawachurl]] targets)
*The bounty target is capable of summoning [[Attendants]] that provide it with buffs, summoning a new set after a set amount of time has expired or after the present set has been wiped out (Kairagi and Lawachurl targets)
*Has an aura that periodically damages players in range
*Restores a large amount of health when they fall below a specific amount

===Sumeru===
Bouties in [[Sumeru]] behave much like in Inazuma; the bounty target appears immediately upon entering the search area, and is accompanied by additional enemies. Apart from the modifiers that other bounties have, Sumerian targets also have additional effects:
<!--todo: expand-->
*Has an aura that periodically damages players in range
*Has an aura that periodically pulls players in and deals Anemo damage in an AoE ([[Ruin Drake]] targets)
*Restores a large amount of health when they fall below a specific amount

==Co-Op==
Bounties can be initiated and completed while in Co-Op. But the bounty is still a single player event. Co-Op teammates are unable to see traces on the ground (i.e. picking up items related to the bounty: they won't see anything on the ground), and have no indication that a bounty is in the area. However, they are able to help defeat the bounty when it is found.

The same applies to [[Inazuma]], however, because there is no tracing mechanic, the host simply needs to enter the zone for the enemy to spawn. If another player enters the zone while the host is not present, the target will not spawn.

==List of Bounties==
Bounties are divided into three star tiers from 3, 4 or 5 stars, awarding 60, 80 and 100 Reputation points respectively when completed and redeemed.

For a detailed list of Bounties with strength/weakness combos, see [[Bounty/List]].
