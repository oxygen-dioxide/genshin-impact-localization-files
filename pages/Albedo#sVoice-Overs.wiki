|vo_05_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Socializing.ogg
|vo_05_02_tx         = Relationships are... quite troublesome. Once you establish a relation with someone, you must continue to maintain it; if you lose contact, you must reestablish the relation. This taxing cycle requires a lot of time...

<!-- About Us -->

|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Assistant.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = Would you oblige me by serving as my assistant? After observing so many experiments, you surely know a good deal about alchemy by now. Relax, we will work together. I don't think you will have any problems. I have faith in my ability to instruct you, and even more faith in your exceptional talents.

<!-- Miscellaneous I -->
|vo_07_01_title      = About the [[Vision]]
|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = My Vision? Ah, that's nothing more than a tool to aid in my experiments, no different from a beaker or crucible. The one thing about it that really intrigues me is the principle behind how it works... One day, I will uncover its secrets, it's only a matter of time.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_friendship = 4
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = There's something I've always wanted to ask you, but feared rejection and disappointment...<br />Eh-hem... I am very interested in your [[Paimon|little floating companion]]. May I borrow her to investigate for a short while?

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = You would like to know more about petrified trees? Erm... Actually, the petrified trees you have come across in domains aren't that ancient. Truly ancient trees usually grow to around one or two miles in height. Oh, and there's a kind of large spider that lives around their roots &mdash; if you tie one up in cape jasmine and lemongrass and sprinkle on some cardamom, smoke it for a few hours &mdash; you get a fragrant taste that's simply... unforgettable.

<!-- About Others -->
|vo_08_01_title      = About Family
|vo_08_01_friendship = 6
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Family.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = Family? Although [[Alice]] has always asked me to call her mother.... when I think of the idea of "family", my [[Rhinedottir|master]] comes to mind first. My earliest memories in life are of going on adventures with her. She taught me the art of alchemy and much knowledge about the world. Perhaps... even the words "family" and "master" are incapable of fully expressing her meaning to me.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Rhinedottir,Alice

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Sucrose]]: Direction
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Sucrose - Direction.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Sucrose? I think I more or less understand why she is so dedicated to her research in bio-alchemy... Either way, I'm happy to see her succeed more and more in her endeavors.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Sucrose

|vo_08_03_title      = About Sucrose: Habits
|vo_08_03_friendship = 5
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Sucrose - Habits.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = Working with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some... stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research. For example, I have told her numerous times to just call me "Albedo" since we are about the same age, but she insists on addressing me in an excessively formal manner. ...Whatever she prefers, I guess.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Sucrose

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Lisa]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Lisa.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Lisa? I always am impressed by the valuable perspectives she brings to discussions. But is a person with her talents satisfied with such a basic occupation as librarian? There must be some hidden reason for this.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Lisa

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Klee]]
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Klee.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = Indeed, I view Klee as my younger sister. Whenever she gets herself into some explosive sort of trouble, I can only console myself with the fact that her current destructiveness is nothing compared to that of Miss Alice.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Klee,Alice

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Jean]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Jean.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = Jean? She has served exceptionally well as Acting Grand Master, one can even say she is more reliable than Grand Master Varka. Perhaps in our hearts, we all eagerly await the day she can become the official Grand Master herself.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Jean,Varka

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Xingqiu]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Xingqiu.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = Oh, Xingqiu? I find his written works quite interesting. The [[Yae Publishing House]] in [[Inazuma]] has been asking that I cooperate with a different author for greater royalties. Hmph, do I seem the type to be swayed by a few extra Mora?
|vo_08_07_mention    = Xingqiu

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Barbara]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Barbara.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = Barbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... [[Albert]] offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Albert,Barbara,Jean

|vo_09_02_tx         = Oh, by the way. Did you know that without human manipulation, you would need to harness the power of a sun eight times the size of our own in order to naturally create gold?

|vo_09_03_friendship = 4
|vo_09_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 03.ogg
|vo_09_03_tx         = The time required to sketch portraits closely correlates with one's mood. I could spend half a day sketching [[Huffman]], while I might only need three strokes of the pencil to sketch [[Kaeya]] &mdash; one for the face, one for the eyepatch string... and one for the eyepatch.
|vo_09_03_mention    = Huffman,Kaeya

|vo_09_04_friendship = 5
|vo_09_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 04.ogg
|vo_09_04_tx         = What do I do besides sketching and research...? I will occasionally read novels from Inazuma and Liyue. They contain many fascinating ideas which can sometimes provide me with unexpected inspirations for my own creations.

|vo_09_05_title      = More About {name}: V
|vo_09_05_friendship = 6
|vo_09_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 05.ogg
|vo_09_05_tx         = Even now, I find the nigredo processing stage of alchemy passed down by my master to be full of mystery. What did my master want to create using this technique...? My research is far from over, I will require your help to investigate further.
|vo_09_05_mention    = Rhinedottir

<!-- Miscellaneous II -->
|vo_10_01_title      = {name}'s Hobbies
|vo_10_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Hobbies.ogg
|vo_10_01_tx         = Hmm... Besides research, the activity I spend most of my time on is probably sketching. At first I saw it simply as a way to better study the structure of living things and materials so as to aid me in my experiments, but it eventually became a hobby of mine. Indeed, it is a very good way to relax.

|vo_10_02_title      = {name}'s Troubles
|vo_10_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Troubles.ogg
|vo_10_02_tx         = There's just never enough time, is there? Even when I remove the most troublesome matters from my schedule, I still can't find enough time for everything.

|vo_10_03_title      = Favorite Food
|vo_10_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_03_tx         = I really do enjoy having dessert. How can I put it...? When both physical and mental capacity are spent, high-energy materials further provide a kind of primordial, highly-effective boost.

|vo_10_04_title      = Least Favorite Food
|vo_10_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Least Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_04_tx         = What food do I dislike? ...Large portions of meat at restaurants. I have a rather small appetite, so a meal like that only ends up in tragedy &mdash; either I overeat and the joy of the taste is lost, or I don't finish it and the food is wasted. I decided to simply not go to restaurants, although that has also meant I must spend more time preparing my own food...

|vo_11_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Receiving a Gift - 03.ogg

<!-- Birthday -->
|vo_12_01_title      = Birthday
|vo_12_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Birthday.ogg
|vo_12_01_tx         = Happy birthday. You look especially happy, would you mind if I sketched you? The capacity of our brains is limited, so we are bound to forget things. But when an image is transferred onto paper or canvas, the sketch becomes an extension of our memory. We can remember that past feeling when we later look at the sketch.

|vo_13_01_tx         = Nigredo is the first step in alchemy, drawing from primordial forms. As beings who live in this world, we must find our own meaning.

|vo_13_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Feelings About Ascension - 03.ogg
|vo_13_03_tx         = Rubedo in alchemy refers to the refining of feeling. I feel the refining of my own emotions is also thanks to you.

|vo_13_04_ascension  = 6
|vo_13_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Feelings About Ascension - 04.ogg
|vo_13_04_tx         = Citrinitas is the final stage of the alchemical transmutation process. The meaning of the object being transmuted has finally been brought to light, becoming gold and revealing its true value... I too have found my own meaning.

==Trivia==
* In his Climax and Conclusion Ascension lines, the stages of the Magnum Opus Albedo speaks of are listed in reverse order; normally, {{w|citrinitas}} is the third stage while {{w|rubedo}} is the final stage. It is unclear whether this is a mistake owing to confusion regarding the words' associated colors (yellow and red, respectively), or if this is deliberate.
