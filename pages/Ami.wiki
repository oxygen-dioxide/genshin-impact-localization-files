==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ami:''' Why do people like to cook out in the open...?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe because it's fun.
::'''Ami:''' Is it really fun? What's so fun about cooking out in the open?
::'''Ami:''' I don't get it.
::'''Ami:''' And what if a bug falls into the pot? That's not fun at all...
::'''Ami:''' That would be a pity, for the bug, also for the grown-ups who eat the food with the bug in it. It's not worth it at all.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Just keep your eyes on the pot.
:::'''Ami:''' Do I need to keep watching until it's done?
:::'''Ami:''' Um... That actually makes sense. If you don't pay attention, bugs might fly in, or you might overcook it.
:::'''Ami:''' Ah, cooking is so complicated! Why doesn't everyone just eat fresh fruits? They are so sweet and delicious!
:::'''Ami:''' That way, no one has to cook or worry about bugs and overcooking!
::;(Obtain [[Zaytun Peach]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it's because they have no choice...
::'''Ami:''' What type of people can only cook outdoors? Is it because they don't have a home?
::'''Ami:''' Then they really don't have a choice. That's sad.
::'''Ami:''' But my dad has a home. Why does he still set up a fire and pot outside?
::'''Ami:''' Is dad doing this for the homeless people?
::'''Ami:''' Hmm... I think I get it now.
::'''Ami:''' Wait, that's not right. Why does dad set up a fire and pot outside for himself, too?
::'''Ami:''' I don't get it now!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ami:''' Hopefully there won't be any creepy-crawlies flying over again...
