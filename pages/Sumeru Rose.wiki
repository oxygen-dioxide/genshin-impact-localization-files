==Descriptions==
{{Description|Bright and beautiful, these pure purple flowers give off a pleasant fragrance that will give any passerby pause. While some like to call this type of “rambler rose,” its relative lack of multiple flowers means that it falls under a different floral classification.<br />From very early times, the Sumeru Rose has been used to make fragrant essences and perfumes. Whenever a festival rolls along, the market will always be filled with the scents of roses. Among the poems that enjoy great fame in Sumeru, the Sumeru rose is oft compared to fine wine, and has thus become a classic symbol within Sumeru literature. "Come, put away your meaningless tribulations! Enjoy the companionship of wines and roses, for there is nothing more important at this time!"|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Another name for the Sumeru Rose is "Ley Line Lodestar". They're sensitive to Ley Lines and emit varying amounts of light in response. Excessive brightness indicates a dangerous level of Ley Line activity in the surrounding area.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Into the Hinterland}}</ref>
