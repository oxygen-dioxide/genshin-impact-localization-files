{{Description|An ancient golden cup that is both marvelously and luxuriously wrought. Murmurings can be heard within its empty innards.}}
'''Defender of the Enchanting Dream''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Desert Pavilion Chronicle]].

==Description==
Travelers here to sup from the oasis, please heed [[Vassal Kings' Retainer|this man]] so old and blind.<br>
Heed the dirge of [[Gurabad]], heed the enrapturing dreams of [[King Deshret]]...<br>
Heed the faithful but broken [[Jinn]], and heed a betrayal between companions.

Legend has it that when the [[Lord of Flowers]] passed, her countless Jinn turned to serve King Deshret.<br>
King Deshret searched in vain for the [[Ay-Khanoum|ancient paradise]] where the [[Celestial Nail|divine needle]] fell, and there created an [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|eternal oasis]]...<br>
Among the greatest Jinn was one named [[Ferigees]], granted governance of the oasis by King Deshret.<br>
To protect her mistress' slumber, she once used her powers to keep the springs ever-flowing,<br>
And so she spread greenery across the desert like stars in the sky, providing sanctuary to folk who had lost their homes...

Later, under the guidance of the Jinni [[Liloupar]], the vassal states of the mortal kingdoms built their cities around the "Eternal Oasis."<br>
Bearing loyalty to the Lord of Flowers and compassion for the newborn realms, Ferigees decided to make a sacrifice.<br>
Disobeying the charge given to her by King Deshret, the great Jinni caged her own body in shackles of frost,<br>
Turning herself into a seal in the shape of a crystalline cup, restraining the wrath of the vast sands, guarding the cities of the mortals with her immobile form...

"But there is a season for all things, and thus all things must change. As we lean on each other today, so too will we abandon each other tomorrow."<br>
"To lose the freedom which the Jinn are so proud of and a vessel that can partake in joy and love, to feel the diminishment of one's spirit by the day."<br>
"The nymph of the water lilies drew [[Parvezravan|mortal kings]] into her machinations with honey-tinged lies, and the Lord of the Sands sank deep into [[Aaru's Shut|a dream of madness]]..."<br>
"But I have long been waiting &mdash; always waiting &mdash; in a sleepless dream... Waiting for the [[King of Sand]] to fulfill his ancient promise."

Mind and body festooned with wretched machinery, she awaits the end of her mistress' slumber,<br>
Bearing a sullen hope as she silently guards the broken dreams of this empire of sand.<br>
Even should the spring be mixed with bitter gravel, even if the oasis is swallowed by sand...<br>
Even amidst the eternal pulsing of machines, she listens for the coming of the footsteps that will bring change.

"But, my teachers so sightless, [[Xiphos|I]] was born into a slave's chains, and had everything taken from me when I was young..."<br>
"Might I, abandoned by the fates like the dunes of sand as I was, be worthy of a change in my fortunes?"
