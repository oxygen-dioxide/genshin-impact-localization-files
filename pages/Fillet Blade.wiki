==Description==
It was said that the Ticker Fish was a favorite among the people of Liyue.<br />
As word caught on, somehow Ticker became Tiger.<br />
Now, the real Ticker Fish is hard to come by,<br />
but Tiger Fish fillets have become synonymous with delicious fish for the people of Liyue.

==Trivia==
*A Fillet Blade serves as [[Kazuha]]'s weapon of choice. He is shown using it in the 1.6 livestream, in his [https://youtu.be/zif0Lmhrivc character demo], and in [https://youtu.be/ytUO6XLh2pU Collected Miscellany - "Kaedehara Kazuha: Free Spirit" | Genshin Impact]; uses it to block the [[Musou no Hitotachi]] in the cutscene in the quest ''[[The Omnipresent God]]''; and as a trial character, switches to it from the [[Prized Isshin Blade (Shattered)|Prized Isshin Blade]] in the quest ''[[Ere the End, a Glance Back]]'' in Kazuha's Story Quest. In the latter, he remarks his weapon is a generic blade that he obtained while in Liyue and that he has used it for many years.
** This weapon may have been chosen for him because of its resemblance to a katana, befitting his status as a wandering samurai. In addition, Kazuha does enjoy eating fish.
*The Chinese version of the weapon's description contains a pun that is difficult, if not impossible, to retain in other languages:
**Grilled Tiger Fish is {{zh|烤'''吃'''虎鱼|tl=Broiled Consuming [Chi] Tigerfish}}, while the dish's original name, Grilled Ticker Fish, is {{zh|烤'''螭'''虎鱼|tl=Broiled Hornless-Dragon [Chi] Tigerfish}}. {{zh|{{wt|吃||Chinese}}|rm=chī|tl=eating, consuming}} is a homophone of {{zh|{{wt|螭||Chinese}}|rm=chī|tl=hornless dragon}}. The word {{zh|螭}} is also used for [[Chi]], the dragon spoken about in the World Quest ''[[The Chi of Yore]]'', and in the Chinese name of {{Lang|[[Serpent Spine]]|zh=螭骨剑|zh_tl=Hornless-Dragon [Chi] Spine Sword}}.
**The area of Liyue Harbor known as {{Lang|Chihu Rock|zh=吃虎岩}} was likely named after the dish.
*The sword may be inspired by {{Lang|''yútóudāo''|zh=鱼头刀}}, literally meaning "fish-head blades," a modern term given to a type of Chinese single-edged swords mainly used during the Ming period (1368–1644).
