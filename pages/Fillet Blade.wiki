==Description==
It was said that the Ticker Fish was a favorite among the people of Liyue.<br />
As word caught on, somehow Ticker became Tiger.<br />
Now, the real Ticker Fish is hard to come by,<br />
but Tiger Fish fillets have become synonymous with delicious fish for the people of Liyue.

==Trivia==
*[[Kazuha]] is seen wielding this weapon in the 1.6 livestream, in his [https://youtu.be/zif0Lmhrivc character demo] and in [https://youtu.be/ytUO6XLh2pU Collected Miscellany - "Kaedehara Kazuha: Free Spirit" | Genshin Impact]. This weapon may have been chosen for him because of its resemblance to a katana, befitting his status as a wandering samurai. In addition, Kazuha does enjoy eating fish.
** In the quest ''[[Ere the End, a Glance Back]]'' in Kazuha's Story Quest, Kazuha says "I'll use my own blade." and then the trial character Kazuha switches his weapon from [[Prized Isshin Blade (Shattered)|Prized Isshin Blade]] to Fillet Blade. After the battle, Kazuha says his weapon is a "generic blade" that he obtained while in Liyue and that he has used it for many years.
*The Chinese version of the weapon's description contains a pun that is difficult, if not impossible, to retain in other languages:
**Grilled Tiger Fish is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=烤'''吃'''虎鱼|zh_tl=Broiled Consuming [Chi] Tigerfish}}, while the dish's original name, Grilled Ticker Fish, is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=烤'''螭'''虎鱼|zh_tl=Broiled Hornless-Dragon [Chi] Tigerfish}}. {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|吃||Chinese}}|zh_rm=chī|zh_tl=eating, consuming}} is a homophone of {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|螭||Chinese}}|zh_rm=chī|zh_tl=hornless dragon}}. The word {{Lang|mini=1|zh=螭}} is also used for [[Chi]], the dragon spoken about in the World Quest [[The Chi of Yore]], and in the Chinese name of {{Lang|[[Serpent Spine]]|zh=螭骨剑|zh_tl=Hornless-Dragon [Chi] Spine Sword}}.
**The area of Liyue Harbor known as {{Lang|Chihu Rock|zh=吃虎岩}} was likely named after the dish.
*The sword may be inspired by {{Lang|''yútóudāo''|zh=鱼头刀}}, literally meaning "fish-head blades," a modern term given to a type of Chinese single-edged swords mainly used during the Ming period (1368–1644).
