'''Ruin Braziers''' are objects found in [[Dragonspine]], [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] and the [[Spiral Abyss]].

==Dragonspine==
Under [[Subzero Climate]], Ruin Braziers are [[sources of warmth]] that mitigate the effect of [[Sheer Cold]] for nearby characters.

Some Ruin Braziers are inactive and cannot be activated until something else is done, such guiding [[Seelie#Warming Seelie|Warming Seelie]] during puzzles.

While active, Dragonspine Ruin Braziers are highlighted as {{Pyro}} entities under [[Elemental Sight]]. However, they are unable to [[Elemental Reactions|react]] with other elements or cause [[Elemental Absorption]]s.

==The Chasm: Underground Mines==
In [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]], Ruin Braziers are typically found in the deeper levels beyond the [[Stony Halls]] and replace the [[Lumenlamp]] in gameplay functionality. They continuously recharge energy for the player's equipped [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]] and each Ruin Brazier costs 1 Lumenstone Adjuvant energy to activate.
