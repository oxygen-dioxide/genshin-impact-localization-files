|text      = A whole bunch of hunters were all asking me about where my Daddy had scampered off to in The Cat's Tail today. I was thinking to myself how he probably got himself drunk in the forest again, but I went out and looked everywhere and couldn't find him! I anxiously went home only to see him busy cooking up a storm in the kitchen.

He said that since today is my birthday, he went out at the crack of dawn to hunt down a boar for a huge birthday feast!

There's no way I can finish such a huge meal by myself, so I invited a lot of friends over to join me. You'll come to, won't you? Seeing as I'm in such a great mood today, I'll even mix up whatever you'd like to drink, since today... today is an exception!

But absolutely no alcohol!
