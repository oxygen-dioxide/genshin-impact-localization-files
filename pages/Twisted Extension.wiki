==Pre-Quest Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Quenin for the first time, optional)
:'''Quenin:''' Ah, this place... Few visit it... After all, it's dangerous here.
:'''Quenin:''' Are you with the [[Ochkanatlan Adventure Team|adventure team]] too...? Hmph, they say the shadow of a black serpent has descended from the [[Legendary Tonatiuh|Tonatiuh]]... You should be careful.
:'''Quenin:''' Or better, leave while you can. There are inhuman things, ha, hiding within the team... Those voices, those curses... so noisy...
:'''Quenin:''' It's pretty quiet around here thanks to the waterfall. Haha... the roar of the falls drowns out everything else, so you can't hear a thing.

;(Talk to Quenin again, optional)
:'''Quenin:''' The waterfall, haha... The roar of the falls drowns out everything else, so you can't hear a thing.
:'''Quenin:''' Oh, it's you. Need anything?
;(Available after defeating 2 Mimifloras)
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Quenin:''' I'm... a warrior of the adventure team. Not one as mighty as our leader, Lord [[Taika]], but I do have my strengths.
::'''Quenin:''' I guard our camp... Sometimes, when I can't sleep at night, I patrol to keep the camp safe.
::'''Quenin:''' Now, I don't know when it started, but there have been fewer and fewer people in camp every day... Huh, wait. Strange... Why am I here now?
;(Available after defeating 3 Mimifloras)
:{{DIcon}} You hear other things?
::'''Quenin:''' Yes, and only here at the waterfall can the sound of water drown them out...
::'''Quenin:''' Can't you hear it? Someone whimpers by your ear, like one who is dying but cannot scream, making only the sound of their lungs struggling for air.
::'''Quenin:''' And then, you will see a pale face, staring at you with anger. A face... like your own.
::'''Quenin:''' Ah, only at the waterfall, only there can I escape those haunting sounds. Hehe, can't you hear them...
::'''Quenin:''' Stay here for too long, brave warrior, and you might end up like me. So, leave while you can.
:{{DIcon}} Nope, don't need anything.
::'''Quenin:''' Is that so... Ah, then take my advice, brave warrior. Leave here quickly.

===Post-Battle Dialogue===
Quenin's post-battle dialogues are not location-specific.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After defeating opponents with Quenin for the first time)
:'''Quenin:''' These inhuman creatures are tough truly{{sic}} adversaries... inhuman monsters, I should say. Greetings, brave warrior... I am Quenin, a member of this adventure team. My duty is...
:'''Quenin:''' My duty... is to eliminate these monsters. Yes, I am a warrior of the adventure team. Be careful, brave warrior...
:'''Quenin:''' These monsters... they are extremely cunning &mdash; capable of disguising themselves in different forms.
:'''Quenin:''' Every night, before I fall asleep, I hear... the sounds they make from their hiding spots in these ancient ruins. This... is why I cannot sleep at the encampment.
:'''Quenin:''' This place is filled with these monsters. You... must be careful, too.
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After defeating opponents with Quenin for the second time)
:'''Quenin:''' Ah, this place really is cursed...
:'''Quenin:''' Do not tarry here too long. You must leave, and quickly... Yes, you must leave before the coming of the pitch-black tide.
:'''Quenin:''' Yes, the pitch-black tide. Its vast shadow is almost upon us. We must... Must ensure that everyone gets to safety. That everyone... is safely evacuated.
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After defeating opponents with Quenin for the third time)
:'''Quenin:''' Why do you linger here still...?
:'''Quenin:''' Our adventure team's leader, the hero who wore a falcon's mask, is already... We cannot hold out against them any longer...
:'''Quenin:''' You must leave as soon as possible. This place is cursed, brave warrior. It is not somewhere that people should stay.
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After defeating opponents with Quenin for the fourth time)
:'''Quenin:''' So you are still here, brave warrior. 
:'''Quenin:''' Once upon a time, so the scholars say, the ancient and tyrannical [[Och-Kan|Lord]] of this Cinder City knew... a way to prevent [[Abyssal Corruption|Abyssal corrosion]]. So we...
:'''Quenin:''' But there really is something ominous about this place, brave warrior. Lately, I too have begun to feel a little... strange. 
:'''Quenin:''' Sometimes, after waking, you'll find that a road that was perfectly intact just the day before has now become broken and dilapidated... And were those stone houses like that there to begin with? It feels like they should be more... complete.
:'''Quenin:''' But sometimes, when I wake, I see friends who should not be here anymore... Are they monsters? That must be it... They're monsters that have taken the form of my friends.
:'''Quenin:''' My... My duty here is to eliminate those monsters, but... why? Why do I have to do that?
:'''Quenin:''' Anyway, all things said and done, this is a very strange place. You should leave... as soon as possible.
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After defeating opponents with Quenin for fifth time)
:'''Quenin:''' You'd better leave at once. If you stay any longer, it'll be too late...
:'''Quenin:''' Why will it be too late, you ask? Because... because our entire adventure team has been wiped out. That giant, pitch-black beast... They were all...
:'''Quenin:''' They tasked me with protecting the evacuees, and at the very least, to ensure that they left the city. As we speak, a rescue team from the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] is on their way...
:'''Quenin:''' I must eliminate these evil monsters, so that the survivors can return to a land upon which the sun shines... Huh, but... Why am I here again?
:'''Quenin:''' That sound in my ears... Ahh, it's getting louder and louder. I... I have to go back to the waterfall. Yes, I must... return to the waterfall.
:'''Quenin:''' Brave warrior, you too should leave... as soon as possible.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|The tribal warrior who fought alongside you has disappeared. Perhaps the truth behind it all is hidden beneath the waterfall...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Read the diary)
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' (A torn page, with neatly written words at the beginning...)
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' "...Abyss monsters are growing in number, as expected... The adventure team has failed in the end, and a planned retreat is in progress."
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' "We must ensure the remaining members can evacuate safely. Be wary of those who vanish at night, or return from places devoid of light."
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' "...The Abyss monsters are appearing more frequently. The stronghold may be discovered soon, but before that..."
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' (The handwriting becomes shaky and distorted...)
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' "Ah, it's cold... So cold... There, over there, blood is draining..."
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' "The sound of the waterfall, so loud... yes, this is good. As long as... under the waterfall, it'll be quiet there... pale faces, opened mouths, drained blood..."
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' "Just there... just... there... something... something is there..."
:'''Quenin's Diary:''' "Under the waterfall under the waterfall under the waterfall under the waterfall under the waterfall under the waterfall..."

;(Investigate the body)
:'''Cold Body:''' (The cold, statue-like body of one resembling Quenin, somehow preserved without decay, seems frozen in time....)
:'''Cold Body:''' (And judging by the surroundings, it has remained in this state for a long time...)
:'''Quenin?:''' Ah... Haha, so... so that's it! I am... Who... What is "I"?
:'''Quenin?:''' Heh... Ironic. So I'm already... "I" died long ago, haha.

;(Approach "Quenin")
:'''Quenin?:''' So I'm a monster, eh? Hahahaha, Me too, me too... Haha, so after all, I am too... Ahh!

;(After defeating the Tenebrous Mimifloras)
:'''Quenin?''': Ahh... brave hero...

==Trivia==
* The suspicious Exquisite Chests cannot be marked by the [[Pyro Treasure Compass]].
* One of the Mimifloras takes the form of a [[Tepetlisaurus Warrior: Rockbreaker Blade]] and Quenin comments that it has "taken over his friend's body," implying that one such [[Nanatzcayan]] warrior was part of the adventure team.
