'''Azosite''' is an ancient form of energy once used by the [[Khaenri'ah]]ns. It was made by extracting pure [[Element|elemental energy]] from [[Ley Lines]] and processing it into a usable form &mdash; [[Energy Block]]s.<ref name="Lost Notes I">Interactable: [[Pages From Some Lost Notes#Pages From Some Lost Notes (I)|Pages From Some Lost Notes (I)]]</ref> This was done at factories like [[Hangeh Afrasiyab]].<ref name="Rene Notes">{{Ref/Item|Rene's Investigation Notes}}</ref>

Azosite is fundamentally the same as elemental energy, so it shares the same limitations and properties, such as the ability to reverse [[Abyss]]al influence. <ref name="Lost Notes I" /><ref name="Lost Notes II">Interactable: [[Pages From Some Lost Notes#Pages From Some Lost Notes (II)|Pages From Some Lost Notes (II)]]</ref>

==Lore==
The Khaenri'ahns used Azosite to power everything from common [[Ruin Guard]]s to large weapons-testing facilities like [[Madinat al-Nuhas]]. Interestingly, however, research from the [[Sumeru Akademiya]] suggests that Azosite energy systems were already in widespread use long before Khaenri'ah even started building their [[ruin machine]]s.<ref name="Jazari Chapter">{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter}}</ref> 

Over time, the Khaenri'ahns discovered more effective power sources (namely, the Abyss);<ref name="Lost Notes I" /> these gradually replaced the old Azosite systems.<ref name="Ragged Notes">Interactable: [[Gavireh Lajavard#Ragged Engineering Notes|Ragged Engineering Notes]]</ref><ref name="Ancient Notes">Interactable: [[Gavireh Lajavard#Ancient Engineering Notes|Ancient Engineering Notes]]</ref> This shift was reflected in ruin machine engineering &mdash; early ruin machines used Azosite backup power systems, while later ones did not. [[Jazari]] suggests that this indicates a period of transition during which the Khaenri'ahns had not yet mastered Abyssal energy (and thus needed the safety net of Azosite).<ref name="Jazari Chapter" />

[[Rene]], a researcher from the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]] in [[Fontaine]], later came across Hangeh Afrasiyab around the time of the [[cataclysm]] and studied Azosite. He came to the conclusion that while it was convenient, stable, and safe, it lacked "will" due to simply being elemental energy.<ref name="Rene Notes" />

==Trivia==
* The author of [[Pages From Some Lost Notes]] notes that [[Khvarena]] and [[Amrita]] also have the ability to repel the Abyss and contemplates the idea of processing them like Azosite, "followed by using Abyss-created... a reaction..." They speculate that this could yield "a true perpetual energy source" or "a way to elevate the mortal and mundane to supreme purity."
