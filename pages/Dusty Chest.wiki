{{Description|The Knights are making progress in their investigation. They learn about a tragic event that happened 3 years ago, but will this clue help them figure out who's behind the Black Fire Incident?}}
'''Dusty Chest''' is Chapter 7 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
''(To be added.)''

==Trivia==
* During the flashback to Crepus's death, Kaeya was originally shown with his Vision. This was later fixed, and the manga on the official Genshin Impact website no longer shows Kaeya's Vision (page 12 of Part 2). However, Kaeya's Vision is still shown in the WEBTOON version, which has not received any updates.
