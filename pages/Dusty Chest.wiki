{{Description|The [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]] are making progress in their investigation. They learn about a tragic event that happened 3 years ago, but will this clue help them figure out who's behind the Black Fire Incident?}}
'''Dusty Chest''' is Chapter 7 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
[[Lisa]] visits [[Diluc]] for questioning. Again, he turns down his involvement in the black fire incident. Lisa reveals her new information that may be linked to Diluc's [[Crepus|father]] and asks him what happened three years ago. Diluc reluctantly agrees to tell the story.

Back in [[Mondstadt City|Mondstadt]], [[Kaeya]] confronts the [[Collei|girl]] as she's exiting the [[Mondstadt Library|library]]. Before he can pry into her further, [[Amber]] steps in as he asks her to introduce him to her friend. She urges the girl to reveal her name: Collei. As [[Jean]] arrives, Collei hands over the [[Delusion]] papers to Kaeya, which Lisa left behind. Kaeya realizes that the incident is linked to a past incident involving Diluc's father and tells the story.

Three years ago, Diluc was celebrating his 18th birthday at a tavern until his father, Crepus, urges them to return home. As they are leaving, the same [[Fatui]] device attaches itself to their cart. They pass through the woods until they are attacked by [[Ursa the Drake]]. Diluc and the escorts fought the dragon but are left injured, forcing Crepus to use the power of his Delusion to protect his son. He successfully drives Ursa off at the cost of his own life. Kaeya and the [[Knights of Favonius]] arrive to help but are too late as Crepus is already dead.

After telling the story, Collei reveals that the Delusion backfired on Crepus.

==Trivia==
* During the flashback to Crepus' death, Kaeya was originally shown with his [[Vision]]. This was later fixed, and the manga on the official Genshin Impact website no longer shows Kaeya's Vision (page 12 of Part 2). However, Kaeya's Vision is still shown in the WEBTOON version, which has not received any updates.
