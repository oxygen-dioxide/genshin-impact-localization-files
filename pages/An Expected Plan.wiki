{{Quest Description|After a thorough investigation, the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] seems to have found a lead on [[Nacker]] and the Arkhium Kinetic Core. Now, all that's left is to bring him to justice.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Fusilier)
:'''[[Raimondo]]:''' I've sent someone to give your report to the Institute. In any case, I shall leave the upcoming work to you, Ms. Fusilier.
:'''Fusilier:''' Of course, Mr. Raimondo. But about the help you mentioned...
:'''Raimondo:''' Don't worry. When the right time comes, our Honorary Senior Researcher will...
:{{DIcon}} Appear by your side.
:{{DIcon}} What trouble are you all planning to cause me now?
:'''Raimondo:''' It's great to see you so soon, Honorary Senior Researcher and the Assistant to the Honorary Senior Researcher. Oh, allow me to introduce...
:'''Raimondo:''' This is the special investigator in charge of the stolen Arkhium Kinetic Core case, Miss Fusilier.
;(If the player previously spoke to Raimondo and selected "Why do you think Nacker stole the core?")
::'''Raimondo:''' You are already aware of the circumstances of said case, so I won't be repeating them. In short, Mr. Nacker is the prime suspect right now.
::'''Raimondo:''' Presently, we've discovered subtle clues in the [[Arkhium]] near Lumidouce Harbor, and... evidence that proves Mr. Nacker is still alive.
::'''Raimondo:''' If we follow these clues to the end, I'm certain that our suspicions about Mr. Nacker will be proven.
::'''Raimondo:''' But our main objective is still to retrieve the Arkhium Kinetic Core as soon as possible. It's an extremely unstable prototype.
::'''Raimondo:''' If our dear Mr. Nacker's practically empty head suddenly has the bright idea of attempting to modify said core...
::'''Raimondo:''' Maybe we'll get to enjoy another grand fireworks show somewhere...
::'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;Wh&mdash;What!? Are you trying to say that it might explode!?
::{{DIcon}} Ugh... Nacker...
;(If the player did not select "Why do you think Nacker stole the core?")
::'''Raimondo:''' Before I ask for your help again, please allow me to briefly explain the case of the Arkhium Kinetic Core's theft.
::'''Raimondo:''' ...And some other key information.
::{{Black Screen|Raimondo briefly explains why the Fontaine Research Institute initially identified Nacker as the prime suspect.}}
::{{Black Screen|An intense surge of Arkhium energy would have filled the [[Central Laboratory Ruins|Central Laboratory]] after the explosion, so only professionals could've engaged in work there for any length of time.}}
::{{Black Screen|And the timing of the Experimental Field Generator's activation and attack was too much of a coincidence. According to Raimondo, the suspect must be a senior researcher linked to the research, and subsequent examinations and reenactments of the events have borne this theory out...}}
::{{Black Screen|The only people capable of this in Fontaine Research Institute are Raimondo, Nacker, and Edwin, the last of whom passed away during the explosion. Raimondo mentions that he too is under internal review... and it sounds like a huge pain...}}
::{{Black Screen|However, locating the Core as soon as possible still remains your main objective... The unstable prototype may go out of control at any moment and release a surge of Arkhium that would affect everything around it...}}
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Doesn't that mean it might explode again at any moment!?
::{{DIcon}} Ugh... Nacker...
::{{DIcon}} Ugh, I just hope it doesn't blow us all sky-high...
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}! I&mdash;It seems we don't have a choice. Looks like Nacker really does deserve a good beating!
:{{DIcon}} He won't get off that easily if I have anything to say about it.
:{{DIcon}} My responsibilities as an Honorary Senior Researcher are back to bite me again.
:'''Raimondo:''' I'll be counting on the two of you. I must return to the Institute.
:'''Raimondo:''' Mr. [[Choiseul]] won't be able to deal with so many journalists for long on his own...
:'''Raimondo:''' Even if it's just for the sake of his health, I ask that you get to the bottom of this matter as soon as possible.
:{{DIcon}} I wish him good health.
:{{DIcon}} I'll buy you as much time as possible.
:'''Raimondo:''' Hahaha! I thank you on his behalf, then.
:{{Black Screen|Raimondo leaves in a hurry...}}
:'''Fusilier:''' Honorary Senior Researcher, let's act quickly. The sooner we find the culprit, the sooner we can clear Mr. Edwin's name.
:{{DIcon}} Mr... Edwin?
:{{DIcon}} You sound like you have a very good impression of him.
:'''Fusilier:''' Edwin has helped me in many ways. He was a... good person.
:'''Fusilier:''' Nacker, on the other hand, is a despicable lowlife who used Mr. Edwin's research to harm the Institute for his own selfish interests! That's unforgivable!
:'''Fusilier:''' It is my belief that he framed Mr. Edwin for the initial explosion in the Institute too.
:'''Fusilier:''' After all, he is the only one who could have benefited from how things have played out up till now... and he has the Arkhium Kinetic Core.
:'''Fusilier:''' If Nacker is really alive, then I will definitely catch him. And then, I'll make him pay for what he's done.
:'''Fusilier:''' But I'm sure you're not here to discuss this, right, Honorary Senior Researcher?
:'''Fusilier:''' It's almost time. Let's head down to Lumidouce Harbor. I'll brief you on the specifics once we get there.

;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' What are we doing here? We look like eavesdroppers...
:'''Fusilier:''' Well, we are here to be eavesdroppers. But I think we have to wait a little longer... Let's get behind those shrubs for now.
:{{Black Screen|You wait for some time behind in the shrubbery...}}
:'''Fusilier:''' Look over there. Those are the people we're waiting for.
<!--The camera pans to three people having a discussion-->
:'''Fusilier:''' According to my investigation, they're reselling a batch of goods linked to the Fontaine Research Institute.
<!--The camera zooms in on the three-->
:'''Fusilier:''' And this may be connected to Nacker... Let's get closer.

;(While approaching the men)
:'''???:''' ...Proposal... Advice...
:'''???:''' ...Transport... Institute... Lesson...
:'''???:''' ...Scoundrels... Threatening me...
:'''Fusilier:''' ...So it does have something to do with the Institute. They seem to be... transporting someone?
:'''Fusilier:''' Get closer. I'll record their conversation as evidence.

;(Get close to the men)
:'''???:''' ...Boss! There's someone over there!
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;We've been spotted!?
:'''[[Loillier]]:''' Mr. Chaussivert, it seems you don't know the rules. I suppose that's as far as my warnings go. Farewell.
:'''???:''' You pretentious... Let's go! Take those snoops out!

;(While fighting Chaussivert)
:'''Paimon:''' L&mdash;Let Paimon explain! We're not bad people!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Sure, but I am!
:'''Fusilier:''' I'm a special investigator from Fontaine Research Institute! We don't mean to intervene in [[Spina di Rosula]]'s affairs.
:'''Chaussivert:''' You have already intervened in my business just by being here!

;(After defeating Chaussivert)
:'''Chaussivert:''' Fine... You're good. It's my loss.
:'''Chaussivert:''' It doesn't matter who hired you to silence me. Just do as you please.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? No one's trying to silence you! Actually... We're hoping you'll talk.
:'''Fusilier:''' We're special investigators from Fontaine Research Institute. Mr. Chaussivert, we suspect that you're involved in the disappearance of our Arkhium Kinetic Core. Please cooperate with our investigation.
:'''Chaussivert:''' So the Institute seeks assistance in their investigation by hiding and eavesdropping? Why am I not surprised?
:'''Fusilier:''' Th&mdash;That's just a necessary investigative technique. Allow me to explain...
:{{Black Screen|Fusilier gives Chaussivert a detailed account of everything. He doesn't seem to fully understand her, however...}}
:'''Chaussivert:''' I don't understand... [[Lemarcq]], what the devil is all of this?
:'''Lemarcq:''' I think she's trying to tell you that some idiot stole something from the Institute, and that thing might explode at any moment.
:'''Lemarcq:''' If it explodes near Lumidouce Harbor, it'll kill all the fish there and render it impassable to ships.
:'''Lemarcq:''' So they're here to get that idiot. That's what you were trying to say, right?
:'''Fusilier:''' Your summary is correct. I guess there is someone here with brain cells to rub together, after all.
:'''Chaussivert:''' I see... So you're here to do good, then. And here I was, thinking that that blasted Loillier had sent you to silence me.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Hmph! I misunderstood you. It's my mistake, so drinks are on me next time.
:{{DIcon}} Silence you? Weren't you discussing a business deal?
:'''Chaussivert:''' A deal? Hahahaha! Looks like this misunderstanding's mutual... I would never do business with trash like Loillier.
:'''Chaussivert:''' He's always with the [[Snezhnaya]]ns, and all he cares about is transporting Fontaine's goods to the outside for his own benefit. He's as bad as they get.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Some time ago, he came asking for my help in smuggling a person out of Fontaine on the down low.
:'''Paimon:''' To smuggle someone out? Could it be...!?
:'''Fusilier:''' Yes, it could be Nacker, the one we're looking for. What happened next, Mr. Chaussivert?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Hmm. He looked to be up to no good, so I turned him down.
:'''Fusilier:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or do you seem a bit... disappointed, Miss Fusilier...?
:'''Fusilier:''' Huh? What? I&mdash;I'm not! How could I possibly hope that someone might commit a crime? No way...
:'''Chaussivert:''' Today, he came all the way to threaten me, telling me not to leak out any information regarding this incident, or else his boss [[Concini]] would personally come to teach me a lesson.
:'''Chaussivert:''' I was just about to teach HIM a lesson when Lemarcq noticed you eavesdropping, and the guy seized the chance and fled... I guess I'll just have to wait until the next time he and I meet.
:{{DIcon}} So this Loillier's boss is called Concini...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon's never heard of him. C&mdash;Could he be a [[Fatuus]]?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, never mind, Paimon's just joking! There's no way that everyone from Snezhnaya who we've met is a Fatuus... Hahaha...
:'''Chaussivert:''' I used to think that way, too, but I really don't know what's going on with that Concini guy from Snezhnaya.
:'''Chaussivert:''' All I know is that he's a major buyer, and he's been purchasing all kinds of goods and equipment and sending them to the harbor. I have no idea what kind of business he's involved in.
:'''Chaussivert:''' That said, since he's associating with the likes of Loillier, he's definitely no better.
:'''Lemarcq:''' Boss, this is not the place to talk. Let's head back to the ship first.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Right. You, come with me. You're looking for that "core" thing or whatever, right? I'll help you with it.
:'''Paimon:''' Heh? What a surprise! And I thought there was gonna be a twist.
:'''Fusilier:''' You... You're not planning to kill us onboard and dump our bodies in the sea, are you?!
:'''Chaussivert:''' This entire Lumidouce Harbor is under my protection. Anyone causing trouble around here is my business.
:'''Chaussivert:''' If what you said is true, then I'm doing the right thing. If not, at least Lumidouce Harbor will avoid disaster. Don't you understand that at the very least?
:{{DIcon}} Y&mdash;You have a point...
:'''Chaussivert:''' Enough chit-chat. You want to talk? Get on the ship and talk.

;(Approach the ship)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... Do you own the entire ship?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Of course it's mine. Now, let's get on with business. That thing might go off at any second, right? There's not a moment to lose.
:'''Fusilier:''' But... We don't have anything else to go on. Based on what we know so far, you run the largest underground trading operation in Lumidouce Harbor and often deal in items related to the Institute.
:'''Fusilier:''' During our investigations at the harbor, our investigators found trace amounts of Arkhium energy reactions on some goods. We believe that Nacker may have come through here with the core...
:'''Fusilier:''' That's why we came to you, following the trade leads, but we didn't expect to find out that...
:{{DIcon}} You're not even involved in this kind of business.
::'''Chaussivert:''' Hmph! The gray market is not the same as the black market... I'm not a parasite like Loillier.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! You just said you're in the gray market. Get off your high horse!
:{{DIcon}} Your mindset regarding trades is surprisingly narrow.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, that's like saying "You lack creativity in your criminal activities"!
::'''Chaussivert:''' Hahaha! Well, I'm certainly not a parasite like Loillier.
:'''Chaussivert:''' If you'd only came to me sooner... I'd have captured that Loillier guy! He said he's gonna teach me a lesson? That, I can't wait to see.
:{{DIcon}} You should've given us a chance to explain, at least!
:{{DIcon}} I should've come out and given all of you a beatdown.
:'''Paimon:''' You're the one who charged at us without a word! We wanted to explain, but you didn't give us a chance to!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Bah! I said two sentences! What do you mean by "without a word"?
:'''Fusilier:''' Loillier... Concini... I'll report their names to the Institute. But now...
:'''Lemarcq:''' Boss, sorry to intrude, but didn't Loillier say something like "there's no use for you now" earlier?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Hmph! That he did! That scoundrel even said that it's a shame how I missed out on a load of cash... I should've punched him in the face right there!
:'''Lemarcq:''' Could that mean... that he's already found someone to do his dirty work?
:'''Fusilier:''' You mean, someone has taken the job?
:'''Lemarcq:''' Yes, and that someone may have been paid already.
:{{DIcon}} So, if we can find out who just came across a sudden windfall...
:'''Lemarcq:''' As far as I know, Loillier prefers to hire poor and lazy slugs who sit around daydreaming...
:'''Fusilier:''' Because people like that are easiest to deceive and control, right?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Well, seems like you've seen your fair share. Perhaps there are also people like that in the Institute?
:'''Fusilier:''' Mr. Edwin once said that if you live your life seriously, you'll find that people like that are all around you.
:{{DIcon}} Right, so no more naps whenever you want from now on, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} It's okay, Paimon. We're not rich, but we're not exactly broke either.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, Paimon, we're no lazy slugs.
:'''Paimon:''' You don't have to stress that!
:'''Lemarcq:''' No worries. I know who to see first... Boss, do you remember Covault?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Sure, I remember him. He used to be the most famous drunkard working under me, but I kicked him out of the outfit because of his habit of nicking this and that.
:'''Lemarcq:''' Well... He's now a regular at The Rusty Rudder. [[Pitot]] said that he's basically there all day, buying up most of the wine...
:'''Lemarcq:''' I think we should go and have a "conversation" with him.
:'''Fusilier:''' Wait. But we don't have any proof...
:'''Chaussivert:''' Proof? Hahaha, if Covault needs some, I'll find him some.
:'''Chaussivert:''' But before that, he has to have an honest "conversation" with me.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Helm, plot a course to The Rusty Rudder!
:{{Black Screen|With Chaussivert at the helm, the ship quickly arrives near The Rusty Rudder.}}
:'''Fusilier:''' *cough* *cough* A person could choke on this alcoholic reek...
:'''Paimon:''' There are so many drunks in here... Can we really find this Covault guy?
:{{DIcon}} Don't most people go home when they've have too much to drink?
::'''Lemarcq:''' With his financial state and moral standards, "home" is a luxury he can't afford.
::'''Lemarcq:''' He has nowhere else to be except the tavern.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe he went to take a breather outside?
::'''Lemarcq:''' Then, we can only hope that he passed out somewhere in the wild and met his end.
::'''Lemarcq:''' In any case, let's at least be civil enough to go look for him.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Just to be on the safe side, let's stay together. The people in this watering hole aren't the friendliest.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Especially you, Institute lady. Don't stray too far from me. These drunkards might try to rob you, given how fragile you seem.
:'''Fusilier:''' Then they will have the privilege of witnessing the power of our proud creations.
:'''Fusilier:''' Mr. Edwin instructed me on how to modify this meka. The energy beam it emits can easily incapacitate a person.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon and I will try our luck over there.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Alright, let's go. I'll take the lead. Lemarcq, you watch our flanks.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Er... Where should we start? Why not ask the boss of the tavern first?
:'''Paimon:''' From what Chaussivert and the others said, the boss's name is... Pitot?
----
{{Quest Description|update|Chaussivert recalls that Covault got rich overnight and is very suspicious. Maybe the deal responsible for that sudden wealth is linked to the Arkhium Kinetic Core...}}
;(Talk to [[Morgen]] on Chaussivert's ship, optional)
:'''Morgen:''' ...Looking for trouble, are you?

;(Talk to [[Pattyn]] on Chaussivert's ship, optional)
:'''Pattyn:''' Hmph... A job that doesn't make you any Mora...

;(Talk to the Drunkard next to the torch, optional)
:'''Restless Drunkard:''' More... more! Who's drinking with me? You... You! You drink with me!
:{{DIcon}} Covault, cut it with the drinking!
:'''Restless Drunkard:''' Who... Who? Never heard of him! You drink? You no drink? Whatever... I drink!

;(Talk to [[Lasselin]], optional)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} About Covault...
:'''Lasselin:''' Oh, him? I just saw him stumble out the door. Not sure which direction he was heading in, though...
:'''Lasselin:''' I can't remember, but he's not in the tavern, that's for sure.

;(Talk to the Drunkard next to the bar, optional)
:'''Self-Pitying Drunkard:''' No... It's not my fault... I didn't want this... It's not me...
:{{DIcon}} Covault, you're in trouble!
:'''Self-Pitying Drunkard:''' You... Oh. You're not here for me? Great... I didn't do anything wrong... Forgive me! I'm trying... I'll do better... *sobs*

;(Talk to the Drunkard sitting next to the ship, optional)
:'''Cheerful Drunkard:''' Drink up! More... Heheheh... Another [[Bulle Fruit]]... Put it... on my tab...
:{{DIcon}} Covault, time to pay up!
:'''Cheerful Drunkard:''' Who... Who's that? Who's... Covault!? Ah, move aside!
:'''Cheerful Drunkard:''' Uh, no... I'm not Covault...

;(Talk to [[Permingeat]] if the player has completed ''[[Rusty Rudder Q&A]]'', optional)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} About Covault...
:'''Permingeat:''' That drunkard? He went outside to sober up. If you're here for some money he owes you, you're wasting your time.
:'''Permingeat:''' Judging by how much he's had to drink... he's probably in a bush somewhere, trying to remember his own name.

;(Talk to the Drunkard standing on the pier, optional)
:'''Incoherent Drunkard:''' [[Romaritime Flower]]... Romaritime... Flower... Heheheh...
:{{DIcon}} What are you saying, Covault?
:'''Incoherent Drunkard:''' I... I'm talking to... the Romaritime Flower... Who's Covault?
:'''Incoherent Drunkard:''' You... You're also Romaritime Flower? What a... coincidence! Hoohoohoo...

;(Talk to Pitot, optional)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Have you seen a guy called Covault?
:'''Pitot:''' Sure. He just bought another round for everyone before stumbling out the door.
:'''Pitot:''' Humph... I wonder where he got all that money.

;(Talk to the Drunkard lying on the grass next to the ship)
:'''Drunkard:''' Heheh... I'm gonna be rich... How dare you belittle me... Burp.
:'''Chaussivert:''' That's him. There's no one else in Lumidouce Harbor with a rat-face like that.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Covault! Get up!
:'''Drunkard:''' Wh&mdash;Who are you? I'm in the money now... Don't... Don't you dare shout at me!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Oh, sure. So where did you get it? Details, if you please.
:'''Drunkard:''' Y&mdash;You... Chaussivert!
:'''Covault:''' You... It's all because I worked for you... that I missed out on making big money!

;(While fighting Covault)
:'''Paimon:''' Why do you have to be like this? All fighting first and talking later!
:'''Covault:''' Chaussivert... I've long been waiting to teach you a lesson... Always saying no to this and that, preventing all of us from making a fortune!
:'''Covault:''' None of us are clean... You... You're the only one riding on the high horse... You'll never strike it rich!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Shut your mouth! I want no part of your dirty money!

;(After defeating Covault)
:'''Covault:''' B&mdash;Boss! Chaussivert! Please forgive me, big man!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Forgive you? Well, that depends on your behavior.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Lemarcq, tie him up and take him back to the ship!
:{{Black Screen|Restrained by Chaussivert, Covault is hauled back to the ship...}}
:'''Chaussivert:''' Sober yet, Covault? Can you speak properly now?
:'''Covault:''' B&mdash;Boss! Chaussivert! I&mdash;I... Please forgive me... That was the alcohol talking...
:{{DIcon}} You want some more to help you relax?
:{{DIcon}} Alcohol steels the soul...
:'''Covault:''' You... You're right, right. Whatever you say!
:'''Chaussivert:''' I ask you a question, you give me an answer. Anything more or less, I knock your teeth out. Clear?
:'''Covault:''' Yes, yes! Crystal clear!
:'''Chaussivert:''' First question. Were you hired by Loillier?
:'''Covault:''' I...
:'''Chaussivert:''' On the count of three.
:'''Covault:''' Yes, yes! He hired me to escort someone to a certain location in Lumidouce Harbor. I don't know who the person is. I just escorted him to the designated location, took the money, and got out of there!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Second question. This person you were escorting, was he carrying something?
:'''Covault:''' Well, he had a large backpack on his back, and nobody was allowed to look at it... But... it was very strange. It was warm, and it kept on buzzing...
:{{DIcon}} Could that be...?!
:'''Fusilier:''' It's the self-heating effect generated by bound Arkhium. Mr. Edwin's talked about it before. The backpack must contain the Arkhium Kinetic Core.
:'''Fusilier:''' And the person must be Nacker.
:{{DIcon}} Guess we've got our man.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna give him a good bashing...
:{{DIcon}} Tsk. If only we could just blow it up.
::'''Paimon:''' Haven't we had enough of that already?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Third question. Where did you escort him to? Give me the location.
:'''Covault:''' B&mdash;Boss... could you give me a map? It's too remote a location to give that precisely...
:'''Chaussivert:''' Sure. I'll get you a map. Don't try anything, or else.
:'''Covault:''' I wouldn't dare... hehehe...
:{{Black Screen|Covault nervously marks the location on the map...}}
:'''Covault:''' Boss, there you go. That's the place.
:'''Chaussivert:''' I assume that there won't be an ambush waiting for me? Or have you hired somebody to take me out?
:'''Covault:''' I would never, boss! You know I won't lie!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Heh... Fine. When we get there, you take point.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Chart a course! That's where we'll be heading!
:{{Black Screen|Chaussivert takes the helm, and you rush to the pick-up point that Covault mentioned.}}

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Covault:''' Boss, we're close. We just need to head further in.

;(Talk to Lemarcq, optional)
:'''Lemarcq:''' You go with Chaussivert and try to find this guy. I'll stay here and guard the ship alongside Morgen.
:'''Lemarcq:''' I even borrowed that device from the Institute Lady. The ship will be in good hands.

;(Talk to Morgen, optional)
:'''Morgen:''' ...What is it? Go do your thing.

;(Reach the marked location)
:'''Chaussivert:''' Lead the way. And you, stay close to me... Lemarcq and Morgen are watching the ship, so I'm the only one who can protect you lot now.

;(While following Covault)
:'''Fusilier:''' Device... Device... Oh! Here it is!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What device? Is that the thing... that can incapacitate people easily?
:'''Fusilier:''' I left that one with Lemarcq. He said it might come in handy.
:'''Fusilier:''' This device is capable of detecting Arkhium energy flow. If Covault told the truth, we should be able to detect residual Arkhium energy here.
:'''Fusilier:''' I hope we didn't come all this way for nothing...

;(While following Covault)
:'''Chaussivert:''' Are we there yet? Covault, don't you dare pull a fast one on me.
:'''Covault:''' No way, boss! You know me, I'm an honest guy!

;(Reach the destination)
:'''Chaussivert:''' Wait. Now that we've gone far enough. what does your device say, Little Miss Institute?
:'''Fusilier:''' No reaction... at all. There is no residual Arkhium energy here.
:'''Fusilier:''' Strange. I've already tuned its sensitivity up to max, and Arkhium energy flow doesn't dissipate that easily...
:'''Fusilier:''' This prototype was made by Mr. Edwin himself... There's no way it doesn't work...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? H&mdash;How come they... and those meka behind them...
:'''Chaussivert:''' I knew it. Pattyn, how much did Loillier promise you?
:'''Pattyn:''' An amount I'd never earn slaving under you in a lifetime. It's nothing personal, Chaussivert. But I have mouths to feed.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Don't you feel dirty getting mixed up with the likes of Loillier, taking his money like that?
:'''Covault:''' Hehehe... Boss, we all roll in the same mud puddle. The money we earn? It's never clean.
:'''Covault:''' You're the only one riding your high horse, saying "this business is no good, that business harms people," like you're some kinda saint.
:'''Covault:''' In the end, you earn no money and win no people. Only a fool like Lemarcq would stay loyal to you.
:'''Covault:''' We've sailed together for a long time. I'm sure Morgen will make his death painless.
:'''Paimon:''' No... Oh no! Mr. Lemarcq is still on the ship!
:'''Fusilier:''' Don't worry. He has the Pneumousia Ray Self-Defense Device, which was personally modified by Mr. Edwin himself. He'll be fine.
:{{DIcon}} You only just came up with that name, didn't you?
:{{DIcon}} You really are confident in that device of yours.
::'''Fusilier:''' I'm just confident in Mr. Edwin!
:'''Pattyn:''' Hmph... Come on, Covault, hurry up and take care of them. Loillier's money is waiting for us to claim it.
:'''Covault:''' Stop telling me what to do! You... Go on, get them!

;(During combat)
:'''Chaussivert:''' You think you can take me down by hiring a few [[Treasure Hoarders]]? You underestimate me, Covault.
:'''Covault:''' Tsk... What's with you guys!? Go get him! Whoever takes him down gets double!
:'''Fusilier:''' You... Stay away from me! Or I'm gonna hit you! This device is pretty sturdy, you know!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Get behind me, Institute Lady! {{Traveler}}, let's clean up this trash!

;(After defeating the mutineers)
:'''Pattyn:''' That Covault! Always the last to work and the first to run!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Shut your mouth! Get to the front!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Let's hurry back to the ship. Lemarcq should still be dealing with Morgen.
:'''Chaussivert:''' I'll deal with you lot later &mdash; slowly.

;(Approach the ship)
:'''Lemarcq:''' Hmm... This device sure is handy.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Looks like Lemarcq just took care of that guy all by himself...
:'''Lemarcq:''' Boss, you're back. Looks like you were ambushed, too. That means...
:'''Chaussivert:''' Loillier has bought both Pattyn and Morgen off. Covault was to lead us into an ambush.
:{{DIcon}} Sadly, they didn't expect me to be there.
:{{DIcon}} Just a motley crew.
:'''Fusilier:''' Wait a second. If they were bought off by Loillier, then what about when you were talking to him...?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Hmm. That can only mean that he had that meeting so he could eliminate me. Hmph. Brutal, but that sounds like him, alright.
:'''Lemarcq:''' Then I suppose it's a good thing that you lot came out of the blue to mess with their plans.
:'''Lemarcq:''' Otherwise, given the narrow space... we might not have made it out alive.
:'''Paimon:''' Still, they've attacked us twice in a row now. Could they have something to hide?

;(The Traveler enters {{color|menu|Contemplation}})
:'''Those behind the scenes, just what are they worried that we might discover...'''

;(Select - Difficult Work)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Considering how many people have been hired to help, the job Concini wants done must be quite tough.

;(Select - The major buyer from Snezhnaya)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Concini is shipping large quantities of household goods and materials inland from Lumidouce Harbor...

;(Select - The transported Nacker)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Covault has been hired by Loillier to take Nacker and the Arkhium he carries to some place inside Lumidouce Harbor.

;(Select - Chaussivert, the Shadow Over Lumidouce Harbor)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Chaussivert claims to cast a shadow over the whole harbor, so he is clearly someone of extraordinary capability. It seems that even Loillier cannot compare.

;(Select - Loillier's boss)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' It looks like Loillier's employer is Concini, who is from Snezhnaya.

;(Select - Not a Businessperson)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Lumidouce Harbor is an international port, so if the goods are being transported inland... This doesn't seem to be about cross-border business.

;(Associate - The major buyer from Snezhnaya to Not a Businessperson)
;(Select - Concini's Goal)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Concini isn't shipping those goods inland to sell them but to give them to Nacker for his use... or for research.

;(Associate - Chaussivert, the Shadow Over Lumidouce Harbor to Difficult Work)
;(Select - Stealing Business)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Loillier must be worried that he will lose his job if Concini realizes that Chaussivert is more capable. Hence the attacks!

;(Associate - The transported Nacker to Loillier's boss)
;(Select - Nacker and Concini)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' It's clear that Concini and Nacker are working together, and that the former has delivered the latter to a location somewhere inland from Lumidouce Harbor.

;(Submit the wrong association)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' No, that can't be it...

;(Submit the wrong conclusion)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' No, that can't be it...

;(Submit Conclusion - Nacker and Concini)
;(Continue to next section)
----
:'''Paimon:''' So... Those three are all in league with each other?
:'''Paimon:''' That Concini guy is like the owner of a restaurant, getting Loillier to find a chef to cook for Nacker...
:'''Chaussivert:''' I told Loillier to beat it, so he went and found someone else to work for him... And then, he wanted to silence me...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, it feels like someone who messed up trying to cover their own mistake.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Huh, I see! Well, that certainly does sound like the right amount of trashy for Loillier! You may be little, but you're quite brainy, you know?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, you can keep the first part of the sentence to yourself! Anyway, now we're sure that Nacker is in Lumidouce Harbor, and we've narrowed down the search area by quite a bit.
:{{DIcon}} (But things are never that simple, are they...)
:'''Lemarcq:''' Ahem... Boss, we better interrogate them to see if they have any useful information.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Hm, good idea. Pattyn, you know the rules, yes?
:'''Pattyn:''' ...I'm at your disposal, Mr. Chaussivert.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Good. At least you accept the consequences of your own actions. Lemarcq, tie him and Morgen up real good.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Go to your cabins and rest. And remember to put on some earplugs... Let's just say that this won't be a silent night.
:{{Black Screen|After some contemplation, you decide to sit down and rest. In the middle of the night, you are awakened by strange muffled noises and the sound of something heavy falling into the water outside of your cabin. Did something or someone fall into the water? Should you go help? Wait. Chaussivert warned you that this will not be a silent night...}}
:{{Black Screen|You walk to the door and grab the handle. The commotion outside has quieted down by now, and only the muffled sound of waves hesitantly lapping against the hull remains as you stand hesitantly before the door. What awaits outside? A question? An answer? Regardless, with just a twist of your wrist, you can verify... certain thoughts of yours, can't you?}}
:{{Black Screen|You hesitate. Despite already having the answer, you still want to ask for Fusilier's opinion. You turn around and see how Fusilier is trying to cover her ears, pretending to be fast asleep.}}
:{{Black Screen|In the end, you suppress your and Paimon's curiosity and decide to not investigate. You just hope that this night will pass quickly...}}
:'''Chaussivert:''' I hope you're well-rested. Pattyn and Morgen have told us everything.
:'''Fusilier:''' How? They were all bent on killing us not so long ago...
:'''Chaussivert:''' Well, that you don't need to know, Little Miss Institute. Lemarcq, tell them.
:'''Lemarcq:''' Aye, aye. To put it simply, with their cooperation, we have learned that two shipments will be delivered to a certain location today...
:'''Lemarcq:''' Unfortunately, those two don't know the precise location. All they know is the time when the shipments will arrive at the shore.
:{{DIcon}} So, more guesswork on our part.
:{{DIcon}} Never mind. We'll see how it goes.
:'''Fusilier:''' I have an idea. We may be able to find some clues using this energy flow detector.
:'''Fusilier:''' If that place is indeed where Nacker is hiding, then people going in and out will carry traces of Arkhium energy.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh! That means that all we have to do is to use this device, and "beep beep beep" &mdash; we'll know exactly where to go!
:'''Fusilier:''' What do you mean, "beep beep beep"? Only those obsolete relics do that! I'm using the latest, silent model.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Beeping or not, this is a good shout. No time to waste. Let's move.
:{{DIcon}} About those two...
:'''Chaussivert:''' They've gone back to where all sailors come from. No need to worry about them... Anchors aweigh!
:{{Black Screen|Chaussivert takes the helm again, and you rush to the pick-up point.}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|Covault's plan to assassinate Chaussivert has been foiled. It turns out they were bought off by Loillier early on. With Chaussivert's "help," Pattyn and Morgen revealed important information: A shipment of goods is about to arrive, and the one at the head of it is none other than the person who hired Covault to assassinate Chaussivert, Loillier... Or perhaps, it is the Snezhnayan merchant, Concini. You decide to go after the shipment. The recipient of the shipment may be connected to Nacker...}}
;(Reach the marked location)
:'''Chaussivert:''' We're almost there... It seems like the shipment hasn't arrived yet.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Let's wait here for a bit. Keep your ears sharp. They might show up any second.
:{{Black Screen|Everyone finds a place to hide and waits for the couriers to arrive...}}
:'''Fusilier:''' Look over there! Are those the people we're waiting for?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Must be. They seem to be handing off the shipment... They'll definitely start transporting it soon.
:'''Paimon:''' Why are we eavesdropping again? But this time, we're eavesdropping on the Treasure Hoarders...
:{{DIcon}} This is how the Institute does things.
:'''Fusilier:''' That's not true! Oh, s&mdash;sorry...
:'''Chaussivert:''' Let's follow him. But be careful, don't get caught again.
:'''Paimon:''' What do you mean "again"?
<!-- There is no dialogue for being spotted. -->

;(After following the couriers)
:'''???:''' Wh&mdash;Who are you? What are you doing here!?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Tsk. You've found me. You've got a keen nose.
:'''Chaussivert:''' We'll leave the thinking to you, Miss Institute Lady. You're the brains, and we're the brawn, after all.
:'''Fusilier:''' Huh...? Hey! Wait! What do you mean by that?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Lemarcq, {{Traveler}}, let's take them down!

;(While fighting the couriers)
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' Someone snitched...! Who are you!? Who sent you!?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Loillier sends his regards. The shipment has been delivered, and you've outlived your usefulness.
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' Just to save the last bit of payment? That penny pincher!

;(After defeating the couriers)
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' Loillier, blast him... He's already paid the bulk of the payment, but he can't afford the rest!?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Chill, man. We're all underdogs here. Don't blame the messenger.
:{{DIcon}} Boss, what should we do with him?
:{{DIcon}} Ma'am, what should we do with him?
::'''Fusilier:''' Wh&mdash;Why are you asking me? And, what's with the "ma'am"? I'm not part of this outfit!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, you handle him.
::'''Paimon:''' Sure! Heheh, just watch Paimon... Hmmm... How many strands of hair should she pull?
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' W&mdash;Wait! Stop! How much is Loillier paying you? I'll pay you the same amount!
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' Or, how about this: Let me live, and I'll take Loillier out and grab his money, and then we can split the cash?
:'''Chaussivert:''' There's no need for any of that. I just have a few questions for it.
:{{DIcon}} Answer them to my satisfaction, you live &mdash; or your head will roll.
:'''Paimon:''' Roll!
:'''Chaussivert:''' Loillier hired you to get the shipments here &mdash; that's it? Did he say who they're for?
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' I... I don't know. All Loillier said was to leave the shipments here, and that someone else would come pick them up.
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' The previous two runs were exactly like that, just at different locations...
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' I once stayed behind to see who the buyer was, but they didn't show. Another group of people took the shipment and headed that way. I dared not linger any longer, so I took off.
:'''Panicked Treasure Hoarder:''' So... are you satisfied?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Good enough. Get out of here. You'd better stay away from Loillier. He's up to no good.
:'''Lemarcq:''' Boss, should I follow him?
:'''Chaussivert:''' No need. Let him go and cause some trouble for Loillier. So, he said that someone would come to pick the shipments up, hmm?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Institute Lady, it's time for you to get that device of yours beeping. We need to move.
:'''Fusilier:''' Didn't I say that this is the latest model, and it doesn't beep?

;(Head along the path)
:'''Fusilier:''' Based on the readings I'm getting... It should be over there.

;(Head further along the path)
:'''Fusilier:''' I'm getting readings! They're weak... but very consistent. Let's keep moving forward.

;(Approach the house)
:'''Fusilier:''' The signals are getting stronger... We're close!
:'''Paimon:''' Look over there! Am I mistaken or is that... a house?
:'''Chaussivert:''' Smoke is coming out of its chimney. Someone's living in there. Stay sharp &mdash; I'll take point.

;(Read the papers on the table, optional)
:'''Papers Outside the House:''' (A stack of papers that has been messily doodled all over. It's now impossible to make out what was originally recorded on the paper. One thing's for sure, though &mdash; whoever was doodling was in a terrible mood.)

;(Get close to the house)
:'''Fusilier:''' The readings... are high. There are clear residual energy readings from all around this house...
:'''Paimon:''' Nacker... Why would he go through all the trouble to build a house here?
:{{DIcon}} He must have strong nerves!
:{{DIcon}} Or he took it from someone else.
:'''Chaussivert:''' The lock on this door doesn't seem too sturdy. I think I can break it open. Stand back.
:'''Fusilier:''' Hey, don't just bash the door in! It might be someone's home... You know, that got irradiated for some reason...
:'''Chaussivert:''' If that's the case, we'll compensate them. It's your investigation, so the money should come out of the Institute, naturally.
:'''Fusilier:''' Huh!?
:'''???:''' What are you doing in my house?
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, you showed up, Nack&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, you're not Nacker... But you're wearing the Institute's uniform...
:'''???:''' You're here to deliver the supplies, aren't you? Just leave the things at the back of the house. Can't you read the note on the door?
:'''Fusilier:''' You're...
:'''Fusilier:''' Mr... Edwin?
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' How do you know me? Tsk... Did Loillier leak my name?
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' No matter. Just hurry and get me the supplies. The suppressor will be ready soon... Hmm? Why are you staring at me?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon must be seeing things from flying too fast...
:{{DIcon}} Well, well, well! Edwin Eastinghouse, come back to life, I see!
:{{DIcon}} Oh no, the Institute is gonna get blown up again...
:'''Paimon:''' Aren't you supposed to have died in the explosion at the Institute!?
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' Wh&mdash;What are you talking about? Stop wasting my time. I'm in a hurry to complete my research.
:'''Fusilier:''' I&mdash;I'm Fusilier from Section 3! You were my research advisor, and you helped me modify the Pneumousia Ray Self-Defense Device!
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' What Section 3? What Ray...? Oh, now I remember. You're talking about that highly inefficient radiation device, aren't you?
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' What was the researcher's name, again... I can't remember. Whatever the case, that device was a solo project with no real practical value...
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' Wait... You must be the Honorary Senior Researcher, {{Traveler}}. Your reputation precedes you...
:{{DIcon}} You know me?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like you didn't quite get blown away far enough.
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' Hahaha! Concini told me about what you've done, and the title you've earned.
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' I have to say, the title suits you well! Just look at you, all hardworking and... Ahem.
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' But of course, I know full well why you're here, Honorary Senior Researcher...
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' You must be here for that Arkhium Kinetic Core, which that slippery fish, Nacker, stole...
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' I apologize, but despite his lack of creativity, pedestrian research skills, and how he's been constantly messing up my facility...
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' We're still in the same boat, so I cannot reveal his location to you...
:'''Lemarcq:''' I hear you, sir. However, I found this map in the house that marks a certain area...
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' Gosh! How did you find this map... But no matter. His precise location won't be that easy to find.
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' You are welcome to go and look for him, but trust me, you could make five loops around the place, and you wouldn't find him. That place took us five full years to build!
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' I still remember that when that place was completed, I restarted five projects and rebuilt five devices. If I were still in the Institute, my salary would've quintupled...
:'''Paimon:''' ...So, what's happening now, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} He's monologuing...
:{{DIcon}} Something must've triggered his inner Institute scientist.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Lemarcq... stay here and keep an eye on this guy.
:'''Chaussivert:''' Miss Institute... I mean, Miss Fusilier. This will be a dangerous trip, so why don't you give me the device? I'll handle things going forward.
:'''Fusilier:''' No. Let's get moving. I... I want to leave!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, she seems pretty upset. What happened? I thought she worshipped Edwin...?
:{{DIcon}} ...Let's catch up.
:{{DIcon}} Edwin didn't even notice her.
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' Good luck. You will never find him! Five rounds, you hear!?
:'''Lemarcq:''' If you keep this up for five more seconds, I'm gonna punch you five times.

;(Talk to Edwin or Lemarcq again, optional)
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' Why are you... You're back again. Told you. You can try five times and still won't find him.
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' It's not working out for you, so why don't you just sit down and have some tea? I just bought five cups... and a few bowls.
:'''Lemarcq:''' You really like the number "five," don't you, Mr. Edwin?
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' Yes! This is a magical number! Use it right, and you can unlock the doors to endless inspiration!
:'''Edwin Eastinghouse:''' Listen up. There are five doors to endless inspiration, and you have to turn each handle five times... Five! You hear? Five times!
:'''Lemarcq:''' Sorry, but I'm really trying to stop myself from punching you five times. Would you please kindly shut your trap?

;(Read the note on the door, optional)
:'''Note on the Door:''' Please leave deliveries at the door. Don't knock, leave messages, or ask for a signature. I'm sick of signatures!
