** Phase 2: Ascending Moon
*** After opponents take DMG from Dendro Cores (this includes Burgeon and Hyperbloom DMG), their All Elemental and Physical RES will decrease by 8% for 6s. Max 4 stacks.
** Phase 3: Rupturing Moon
*** When Dendro Core attacks (this includes Burgeon and Hyperbloom attacks) hit an opponent, a shockwave will be unleashed at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. A shockwave can be unleashed this way every 2s.
