Refining '''Tamayuratei no Ohanashi''' requires its refinement material {{Item|Smoldering Phosphorescent Flame}} instead of identical weapons, 4 of which can be obtained through the [[Enchanted Tales of the Mikawa Festival]] Event.

==Description==
Legend has it that even among the spectral flames that drift through the wilds, flickering away like phosphorescent cinders, the essence of an ancient Inazuman spirit may be found.<br><!--
-->Drawn to secrets like a moth to a flame, this invisible youkai took the latter's form, flitting from hearth to brazier,<br><!--
-->And amidst the crackling firewood, stole stories from the mouths of those gathered around, chatting and clutching their warm cups of tea.<br><!--
-->It later recounted all these interesting tales at banquets of wandering spirits,<br><!--
-->For amusing the great and the good while they drank and made merry was precisely what the Otogishu existed for.<br><br><!--
-->"Ah, what a wonderful evening. May the years ahead be filled with many a night as happy as this."<br><!--
-->Thus sighed [[Hakushin]], chief amongst [[kitsune]], perched high up on the seat of honor, surrounded by an entourage of her kin.<br><!--
-->"Time, oh time, if only we could stop it here," she mused, and as she did so, raised her sake cup,<br><!--
-->Conferring the title of "Tamayuratei" upon the lowly, unknown youkai on the stage.<br><br><!--
-->But life seldom goes as we wish it, just as prayers born of anguish are frequently left unanswered.<br><!--
-->The fleeting melancholy that came upon the Hakushin chief proved prophetic; for as we all know, the day came when [[Cataclysm|a dark, corrosive tide]] engulfed the land.<br><!--
-->Gone were those nights when a hundred youkai larked with such abandon &mdash; only weeping and wailing could be heard by the lamplight.<br><!--
-->Amid a battlefield of such cruel devastation, was there still a place for one who had once inspired joy through playful banter?<br><!--
-->Yet remembering the great one to whom it owed its name, despite its frailty, the little youkai felt compelled to act.<br><!--
-->In those days when shadows blotted out the sky, its very soul was ablaze as it roamed the land, darting from fire to fire.<br><!--
-->Its eloquence, once employed in the telling of frivolous tales, it now devoted to the precise relaying of battle reports and accounts of enemy movements.<br><br><!--
-->Yet, as time went on, such ceaseless exertions took an irreparable toll.<br><!--
-->Dividing its essence again and again, the youkai nearly expended its entire spirit.<br><!--
-->No longer could it utter such clever words from within its lantern,<br><!--
-->And even its most cherished memories were scattered.<br><br><!--
-->Today, it is said that the bewildered youkai has forgotten all,<br><!--
-->Only appearing on the most lively of occasions, when large crowds gather to hear the most fantastic of tales.<br><!--
-->Perhaps it is stirred by the atmosphere such storytellers create,<br><!--
-->Allowing it to recall, if but momentarily, a past it can never reclaim.
