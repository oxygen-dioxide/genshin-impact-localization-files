|description  = A rare and valuable butterflyfish variant from [[Inazuma]]. It loves water bodies suffused with [[Electro]], and seems to derive joy from electric currents.<br />It is said that these fish were once from the same line as the [[Abiding Angelfish]] of Liyue, until traveling merchants exported them to Inazuma. There, their behavioral patterns underwent an unexpected shift. At present, some researchers have begun to use them in conjunction with [[Electro Slime]]s for experiments.<br />"Ma... Mah... Mah tung ith numm..." &mdash; A certain greedy gourmet after trying a Raimei Angelfish dish.
