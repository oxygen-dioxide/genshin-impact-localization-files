==Trivia==
* Floating Abode does not have a visible difference between day and night, and many [[Landscape/Lighting|Lighting]] furnishings placed outside will not light up. This can be advantageous for players who want to create builds without having to spend load on Lighting.
** Despite the lack of day-night cycle outdoors, there is still a day-night cycle inside the realm's [[Mansion]].
