'''Torrential Turbulent Charge''' is part of the [[Mega Meka Melee]] event during [[Version 4.0]]. Complete the {{Quest|Aqueous Tidemarks}} to begin.

==Tutorial==
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Mega Meka Melee Torrential Turbulent Charge 1.png
|text1  = In Torrential Turbulent Charge, your character will automatically move forward in the water, and you can adjust their direction to a certain extent.
|image2 = Tutorial Mega Meka Melee Torrential Turbulent Charge 2.png
|text2  = Turbulent Bubbles might appear in open-water challenges, and contact with such bubbles will enable your character to charge forward a certain distance.<br>Make use of Turbulent Bubbles to efficiently reduce time consumption.
|image3 = Tutorial Mega Meka Melee Torrential Turbulent Charge 3.png
|text3  = Hidden obstacles might appear during the challenge. These cannot be seen unless your character gets within a certain distance of them. Contact with them will induce punishment &mdash; your challenge time remaining will decrease.
|image4 = Tutorial Mega Meka Melee Torrential Turbulent Charge 4.png
|text4  = Turbulent Rings will be present during the challenge, and traveling through these rings will enable your character to charge forward a certain distance.<br>Make use of Turbulent Rings to efficiently reduce time consumption.
|image5 = Tutorial Mega Meka Melee Torrential Turbulent Charge 5.png
|text5  = Special obstacles might appear during the challenge. Contact with them will induce punishment &mdash; your challenge time remaining will decrease.

==Stages==
===I: Ascend Like a Seahorse===
{{Description|"How do [[Bubbly Seahorse|seahorse]]s move through the water?"<br>Few people ever stop to think about things like this. But once you observe their unique shapes and swimming postures more carefully, it becomes apparent that floating and diving are actually easier for them than for other fishes. A valuable observation indeed!|Map Marker Description}}

===II: Sidle Like a Crab===
{{Description|"How does a [[Armored Crab|crab]] swim?"<br>This is a question that even anglers who have spent much time with aquatic creatures are likely to have neglected. If you take a moment to observe them, however, you will notice that they are quite skilled at moving sideways &mdash; which in fact allows them to sprint underwater!|Map Marker Description}}

===III: Shift Like an Octopus===
{{Description|"If a drummer could somehow simulate the rhythm of a swimming [[Ball Octopus|octopus]], their drumbeats would be executed with machine-like precision."<br>This witticism, once published in the pages of The Steambird, sums up the unpredictability of an octopus's speed changes. Perhaps this is something that divers would do well to learn from &mdash; after all, the ability to change speed at just the right moment might have many benefits for underwater exploration.|Map Marker Description}}

===IV: Roll Like an Otter===
{{Description|"[[Leisurely Otter|Otter]]s can switch between swimming on their front and back as they please."<br>For ordinary people who aren't so adept at swimming, as well as artificial mechanisms that need to be able to travel underwater, learning some of the tricks used by otters could enable much greater freedom of movement in complex underwater environments &mdash; even if frequent rolling around isn't required.|Map Marker Description}}

===V: Jink Like a Sea Hare===
{{Description|"It's said that [[Angelic Sea Hare|Sea Hare]]s are able to dodge most attacks with their lightning-fast jinks."<br>Regardless of the credibility of this report, traveling through underwater areas scattered with rocks, weeds, and ruins certainly requires great agility. Despite the differences in bodily structure, perhaps this movement could be learned through dedicated training!|Map Marker Description}}

===VI: Break Through Like an Iron Fish===
{{Description|"As long as there is a task to complete, we must keep going &mdash; even in the most terrifying waters. Be brave like an Iron Fish!"<br>An experienced diver once used these words to encourage learners. The "Iron Fishes" referred to are in fact none other than "[[Maintenance Mek: Initial Configuration|Water Maintenance Fish]]" driven by clockwork meka. The courage of this new diver has encouraged many a newcomer to overcome their fear of deep water. Naturally, toys capable of imitating the agile movements of Champion Duelists should not fall short of common Water Maintenance Fishes either!|Map Marker Description}}
