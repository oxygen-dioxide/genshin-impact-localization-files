==Profile==
"Tricky Bulle Fruit" is a member of the [[Fruity Order]], a group of [[Treasure Hoarders]] operating in [[Fontaine]]. At some point while out on a scavenging trip, he discovered an infant [[Blanche (Fontaine)|Blanche]] in the wilderness, who had been abandoned. He took her in and they viewed each other as family.

He betrays the Fruity Order to try to give his sister Blanche a good education and a better life, using the rediscovered "Pure Water" formula that he found by chance while wandering the remains of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. He initially tries to trap the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], believing them to be assassins sent by his boss, but after some clarity from Blanche, sets them free and apologizes.

To punish his betrayal, the Fruity Order's boss sends [["Ruthless Calla Lily"]], [["Trendy Zaytun Peach"]], and [["Guileless Wolfhook"]] to kill him. However, "Trendy Zaytun Peach" and "Guileless Wolfhook" refuse to fight him, while he manages to defeat "Ruthless Calla Lily" in a fight. Blanche gives them a copy of the formula to settle the matter. They decide to let "Tricky Bulle Fruit" go, and falsely tell their boss that he had died.

Once he creates the formula, he sends it to the Fontaine Research Institute as an anonymous donator. He also manages to find and hire a photography tutor for Blanche. Upon his arrival at the Fortress of Meropide, he plans to set up a shop at the prison, though it is still in the works. He later discovers [["Intrepid Valberry"]] at the prison, though he plays it off as his eyes deceiving him.

===Appearance===
"Tricky Bulle Fruit" has short, orange-brown hair and blue eyes. He wears the same outfit as a [[Treasure Hoarders: Raptor]].

:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Huh? Benefactor! How did you get in? Oh, forget it. I forgot how masterful you are. You definitely have your ways.
:{{DIcon}} And how did you get in this time?
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Haha, good question! Don't forget, I don't have this name for nothing! I've got my ways too.
:{{DIcon}} So how's business?
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Shh... Keep quiet. I'm still figuring this place out.
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Seems like most people here only go to the Rag and Bone Shop to buy their bric a brac. I can't go prancing about with my wares setting up shop willy-nilly... Wouldn't be good to attract the wrong kind of attention from certain parties...
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Especially that [[Alvard]]...
:{{DIcon}} How's Blanche?
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' She's good. I found her a tutor before coming in. Heehee, can you guess what kind of tutor? Photography!
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I've told the tutor to fill her world with pictures every day, all of beautiful scenery from exotic locales abroad. This way, she's bound to want to visit them someday.
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' And in the future, she won't be so against the idea of going overseas to study.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You haven't changed a bit.
:::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' You can't forget where you came from and, of course, what others did for you. Please take this, as a token of my appreciation.

:{{DIcon}} What red-haired guy?
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Oh, I used to have a buddy with red hair. Maybe I haven't been getting enough sleep recently, because I keep seeing him around down here in the prison. My eyes must be playing tricks on me.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Goodbye, Benefactor!
