==Lore==
Qiaoying Village is famous throughout Teyvat for its tea, which is sold in [[Liyue Harbor]] and exported to other nations.<ref name="4.4 Special Program">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/abZdO3rWoVc?t=222 Version 4.4 Special Program] (Timestamp: 3m 42s&ndash;5m 24s)</ref> Fontaine imports tea via [[Lumidouce Harbor]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Xing Cheng}}</ref> A special cauldron in the village, said to be an [[Adeptus|adeptal]] mechanism, is used to roast tea leaves, giving them their unique aroma and flavor. People believe that the land and waters of Chenyu Vale were blessed by the adepti, which helped create the ideal environment for tea cultivation,<ref name="4.4 Special Program" /> and significant quantities of tea trees are planted around the village for their leaves.<ref name="zhongli tea event">{{Ref/Quest|Surrounded by the Aroma of Tea}}</ref><ref name="spiritstone quest">{{Ref/Quest|Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?}}</ref>

The adepti, particularly [[Fujin]], were responsible for the good growing conditions of the vale, having planted the first tea tree in the region. When [[Lingyuan]] attempted to revert the land back to its original state, this caused the quality of village's tea leaves to fall, and was only restored when Fujin spent her powers to revert the damage Lingyuan caused.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade}}</ref>

The village performs an annual tea-serving ceremony, using the wilted petals of Spiritscent Flowers to prepare floral tea.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Soulscent Bloom}}</ref>

Some tea cultivars grown in Qiaoying Village include:
* Dipped Dew<ref>{{Ref/Item|Dew-Dipped Shrimp}}</ref>
* Tianheng Bohea<ref name="Liben May 2022" />
* Qiaoying floral tea<ref name="Liben May 2022" />
* Sunglo Tea<ref name="4.4 Special Program" />
* Single-Origin Yauwan Tea<ref name="4.4 Special Program" />

==Trivia==
* [[Zhiqiong]] was once commissioned to map the terrain of Qiaoying Village for a construction project. However, after she had collected the data, the project was shelved. She also notes that the village has a very strong odor of tea and talks about one particularly skilled tea maker whom she calls "the old man."<ref name="spiritstone quest" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Chasm Spelunkers}}</ref>
* At [[Hu Tao]]'s request during the [[Lantern Rite Festival]] in the Event [[The Exquisite Night Chimes]], [[Zhongli]] collects tea seed oil and sesame oil from Qiaoying Village, as they could not be found around Liyue Harbor.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Between Facades and Familiar Faces}}</ref>
** In his 2023 Birthday Mail, Zhongli later returns to the village to relax and reflect on the past with friends; the [[Traveler]] is among those he invites.<ref>{{Ref/Mail|page=Mail/The End of Another Year... (2023-12-31)}}</ref>
* Qiaoying Village's architecture is inspired by {{w|Hui Style architecture}}.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/abZdO3rWoVc?t=1315 Version 4.4 Special Program] (Timestamp: 21m 55s)</ref> However, the curved roofs likely draw inspiration from {{w|Lingnan architecture}}.
* After completing the {{Quest|The Roaming Abode}} and waiting one in-game day, a blue flower will appear behind a house northeast of the village. Interacting with the flower for the first time awards the player a 4-star [[Soulscent Bloom]].
