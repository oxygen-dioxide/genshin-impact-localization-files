==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Today's commissions are done and dusted. Time to check up on [[Jean]] at the Cathedral.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing all three commissions)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, think we're finally finished with the commissions we were doing for Jean. A day in the life of Jean really is hard work...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wonder how she's feeling now? Let's head to the Cathedral and pay her a visit.
{{Dialogue end}}

===At The Cathedral===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Barbara)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi Barbara, we're back.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Welcome back. You must be exhausted.
:{{DIcon}} How is Jean doing?
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure you must be exhausted, too.
::{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Oh it's nothing, looking after patients is all in a day's work for me.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Jean has regained consciousness and should be back to her normal self soon enough.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's great news! Let's go and see her.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 04.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' But she just left the Cathedral. I tried to tell her she needs more rest, but she wouldn't listen.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 05.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' She tried to act like she was fine and kept saying she wanted to get some fresh air. I bet you she's gone to {{Color|buzzword|Lady Vennessa's place}} again.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 06.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Oh, that {{Color|buzzword|huge tree at Windrise}}. That place is dedicated to Mondstadt's hero, [[Vennessa]].
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 07.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Jean goes there whenever she feels lost and confused, deep down inside.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Barbara, that's some pretty personal stuff... How do you know so much about Jean's innermost thoughts?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 08.ogg}} '''Barbara''' ...Jean uh, mentioned it to me, y'know, before she left.
:{{DIcon}} Jean is still recovering, right?
:{{DIcon}} Will she be okay out there on her own, in her condition?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 09.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' That's what I'm worried about, too. But I still have work to do here...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we'll take over nursing duty for now.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 1 barbara 10.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Great! That puts my mind at rest. May the Anemo Archon protect you... and Jean.

;(Talk to Barbara again)
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Jean is not as strong as she comes off. It's so good that you're here for her.
{{Dialogue end}}

===A talk with Jean===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Jean at Windrise)
:{{A|vo ktlq005 cs qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Lady Vennessa, I hope your watch over Mondstadt remains unclouded.
:{{A|vo ktlq005 cs qin 02.ogg}} {{A|vo ktlq005 cs qin 03.ogg}} {{A|vo ktlq005 cs qin 04.ogg}}  '''Jean:''' I do not know if I, or the rest of the world, as you had hoped for have become stronger... Huh?
:;(Traveler and Paimon talk to Jean)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi Jean, are you feeling better now?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Much better. I was not expecting you to come here. Thank you for your concern.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you sure? We saw you beneath the tree just now, leaning on your sword &mdash; it looked like you were struggling.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you sure you aren't pushing yourself too hard?
:{{DIcon}} You can always rely on other knights.
:{{DIcon}} You can always rely on us.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Oh... Thank you, that means a lot to me. Hearing that boosts my spirits.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' But I must find a way to cope with minor setbacks like this on my own. Otherwise, how can I be the protector that Mondstadt needs me to be? The protector that Vennessa was...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You truly revere Vennessa, huh?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I do. Vennessa was the first Grand Master, a kind yet formidable woman. I have always hoped to follow in her footsteps.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' As the Lionfang Knight, she courageously overthrew the oppressive ruling aristocracy of her time. Then, she founded the Knights of Favonius and became known as the Dandelion Knight, spreading grace and compassion throughout the land.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dandelion Knight &mdash; isn't that your title?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Hmm... Actually, all of the Knights of Favonius' Masters throughout the ages have inherited the title of "Dandelion Knight" or "Lionfang Knight."
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oooh, that makes sense now.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You too want to be as gentle as the Dandelion Knight and yet as fierce as the Lionfang Knight?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Yes. I know it sounds like a huge honor, inheriting both these titles from Vennessa...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' But I see it more as a huge responsibility.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' After all, it is a lot to live up to.
:{{DIcon}} I could get used to Jean the Lionfang Knight...
:{{DIcon}} Actually, Dandelion Knight suits you better.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' ...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Jean?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 11.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Who's there?
:;(An Abyss Mage shows itself)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 abyss 01.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Hmph... Caught red-handed.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 abyss 02.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Finally, an opportunity comes to get rid of the Master in her moment of weakness... and then you two show up and ruin everything.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How did they know about Jean's condition?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Choosing this moment to strike is a low blow, even for this lot.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 12.ogg}} '''Jean:''' As long as my name is the Dandelion Knight, I swear I shall not be defeated by such despicable means!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 abyss 03.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Hmm, since this opportunity has slipped away, I shall now be slipping away in a similar fashion...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 13.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Stop! *cough*
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 14.ogg}} '''Jean:''' After him... *cough*
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Jean, you're still recovering...
:{{DIcon}} You should go back and rest.
:{{DIcon}} He could be luring Jean into a trap...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 15.ogg}} '''Jean:''' No. I must got after him...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Jean, you can't keep doing this to yourself. Why can't you trust us to handle it?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 16.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I do trust you... But to let an enemy get away like this would be a major dereliction of duty.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fine, but at least let us go with you.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 17.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Thank you for your understanding. I will graciously accept your help.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Exploring the Domain===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After an explosion inside the domain)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you hurt!?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, darn him and his traps!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 18.ogg}} '''Jean:''' How badly are you hurt? One of my own being injured because of me is the last thing I would wish for.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 19.ogg}} '''Jean:''' ...Let me handle this alone.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No! You're in no state to handle this alone. We're coming too!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 20.ogg}} '''Jean:''' ...Okay. But before we move out, at least let me heal everyone with my {{Color|buzzword|Dandelion Breeze}}.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, you're amazing!
:;(As you explore the domain)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 abyss 04.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Looks like our fates are intertwined. To think you chased me this far!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 abyss 05.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Hehe, come on! Face my brave subordinates. I put a spell on them to calm their fear of water.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 abyss 06.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Hehehe, face the fury of my flames! Just one is enough to reignite the fiery fury of the rest!
:;(The Abyss Mage reveals himself)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 abyss 07.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Looks like our fates are intertwined. To think you pushed me this far! Fine &mdash; let me deal with you myself!
:;(After defeating the Abyss Mage)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 21.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Phew... Thanks to Barbara's help, my condition is better than I thought.
: {{A|vo qinlq005 4 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The main thing is that you're safe. Now, isn't it time to get {{Color|buzzword|back to Mondstadt}} and rest, Acting Grand Master?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 4 qin 22.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Yes. I should at least go and thank Barbara again. I hope she is not upset with me.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Back at Mondstadt===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(At the entrance of Mondstadt)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 swan 01.ogg}} '''Swan:''' Master, you've finally returned! The Anemo Archon protects you.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Swan? Were you waiting for me? Has something happened?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 swan 02.ogg}} '''Swan:''' Yes... At the {{Color|buzzword|Angel's Share}}. Don't worry, it's nothing big, but...
:{{DIcon}} Has there been a bar fight!?
:{{DIcon}} We'll go. Jean needs to rest.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 swan 03.ogg}} '''Swan:''' Ah... I know I said it's nothing big, but... Alright, how can I put this... They just really need the Acting Grand Master.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Well, if you say so Swan, I will go. I should not let the other knights down.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' It's fine. Now that I have had the chance to stretch my legs, I feel much better.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 swan 04.ogg}} '''Swan:''' Great! Thank you so much, you really saved me this one.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For goodness sake... What is happening to the world!? Swan used to be the most honest fellow, now he's dumping things onto Jean...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 5 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Well... Swan was clearly agitated. Maybe it is an emergency after all. Let's go and see what this is all about, shall we?
{{Dialogue end}}

===The surprise party===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After seeing the party set up in the tavern)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Oh? What's all this?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' It's a thank-you party for you!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' A thank-you party?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 barbara 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Jean, when we heard the news about your illness, we were all so worried about you.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' We can only imagine how much pressure you must be under as Acting Grand Master, and you do so much work all over Mondstadt...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' We thought that since you so rarely take any time off, we'd take this chance to throw you a party. Enjoy yourself, Jean.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' After all, you'll never let us do this once you're back at work, haha.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Ahh...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Jean?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I... Uh...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Huh? Is this Jean when she's... shy? I've never seen her like this!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's easy to forget that outside of work, Jean is just a normal person, like anyone else.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I... This is just all such a surprise!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Thank you, everyone. This really means so much to me.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Hehehe. Well, it's nothing compared to the amount of work you do for all of us, day-in and day-out.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' But... there are so many things I still need to do...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' *sigh*
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Fear not. We wanted to make sure you could relax and enjoy yourself...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So while you were away, we all pitched in and finished off your work for you. Every last task.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Did you really? ...Even the issue with the food deliveries?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' It was no different from what we see on patrol. A couple of hilichurls. Didn't take much to get rid of them.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' And the tax returns?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I spend so much time doing library admin. A few more pieces of paper to deal with was really nothing to worry about.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Well... What about Margaret's missing cat?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Are you kidding me?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' That rascally Prince was apprehended by the brilliant {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} (Traveler)! And {{MC|m=he|f=she}} also reclaimed my precious astral iron strings while {{MC|m=he|f=she}} was at it.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Enough already! No more thinking about work today! Enjoy yourself while you've got the chance.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 11.ogg}} '''Jean:''' It is my honor to work alongside you all. Praise be for the Anemo Archon's guidance...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 12.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Speaking of work... It must have been hard work to put all this together, where did you find the time?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha... Actually, (Traveler) was the key organizer behind all of this.
:{{DIcon}} Me?
:{{DIcon}} The organizer?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' See all this food and drink? (Traveler) made sure it all arrived on time.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 07b.ogg}}<!--sic uses the male for female traveler--> '''Kaeya:''' Not only that but {{MC|m=he|f=she}} cooked each one of these beautiful dishes {{MC|m=himself|f=herself}}.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So relax already. There's no need to be so modest!
:{{DIcon}} Uh... This explains a lot!
:{{DIcon}} All those last-minute urgent orders... It was you all along!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Of course, we also have Master Diluc to thank for the venue. Otherwise, we would be looking at quite an alarming bill right about now.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' ...Despite my initial reluctance to sponsor a Knights of Favonius event in any way...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I, like any other citizen of Mondstadt, owe Jean my gratitude for her hard work.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 qin 13.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Oh Master Diluc, I&mdash;
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 barbara 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Alright, alright! Jean's supposed to be taking it easy, stop crowding her!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Agreed! Now &mdash; let the party begin!
:;(The party starts)
:'''''You enjoy a spirited and cheerful party&mdash;'''''
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks like everyone seems to be partying hard...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks we should join in the fun. Let's go and mingle!
:{{A|vo qinlq005 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and Paimon thinks she saw {{Color|buzzword|Jean go upstairs by herself}}... Let's make sure the woman of the hour doesn't get left out.

;(Talk to Amber)
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' (Traveler)...
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Amber! You look like you're about to burst into tears, whatever is the matter?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Two things! One, this Sweet Madame! Two, this Sticky Honey Roast!
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Did you make them?
:{{DIcon}} You'd better believe it!
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Mmm... I refuse to believe it! Where did you suddenly learn to cook so well?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I'm going to finish eating this, and then you're going to teach me everything you know! Don't you dare try and run off!
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' *om nom nom*
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Has... Amber been drinking?

;(Talk to Barbara)
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Whew... This is quite a lot of excitement, considering that the idea was to relax and take it easy.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Would a drink help you relax?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Ahh... Is there anything without alcohol?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you normally drink?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 04.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Oh, y'know, I normally mix a few things together but I always add some bright red&mdash;
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Red? Let me guess... tomatoes? No, watermelon?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 barbara 05.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' ...Hehe, chilis! I add chili peppers.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chili peppers!? In a drink?

;(Talk to Diluc)
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' That's glass number thirty-seven.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's Diluc doing?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I am keeping count of this bard's alarming pace of progress through my wine.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Only the Knights drink for free tonight. It seems he didn't get the message.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 04.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' When he sobers up, I will present him with the bill.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Diluc... You're a meanie!
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 05.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' ...I'm joking, of course. I highly doubt he could afford it anyway, so I shall spare him the bill.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 diluc 06.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' But I must say, the sheer volume of alcohol this fellow can put back is just not normal.

;(Talk to Kaeya)
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hey! Having a good time?
:{{DIcon}} Why did you say I was the organizer?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The thing is, Jean knows all of us so well now...
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' When someone organizes a surprise party for you, the closer you are to them, the more bashful you tend to feel about the whole thing.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So instead, we just gave you all the credit. After all, you did do more than your fair share of work anyway.
:{{DIcon}} So... You gave me the credit to hide your own shyness?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course! This party was clearly Kaeya's idea! Shy Kaeya? This is gold!
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha... You think so?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you admit it!
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hehe... I'm only indulging you since it's such a special day today.

;(Talk to Lisa)
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' "Leaving the hustle and bustle of the banquet behind them, the two of them stood there, together in the quiet of the night, while the rest of the world melted away around them..."
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Sounds like the sort of thing you'd find in a romantic novel, no?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I'm not trying to get you to recite poetry to me or anything...
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I'm just saying, {{Color|buzzword|Jean went upstairs to the balcony. Alone.}} Now's your chance... Hehe.

;(Talk to Venti)
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' My word, the Dawn Winery's wine is every bit as delectable as they say!
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I would never be able to afford this normally, so in the spirit of enjoying the moment while it lasts... Another glass for the bard, please!
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Venti can drink a frightening amount...
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah, hello! I didn't see you there.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I blame the wine for monopolizing my attention! Much like my ballads, it deserves to be enjoyed for generations to come.
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' What is this floating sensation I feel? Have I discovered the true meaning of Anemo power?
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That would be the drink talking...
:{{A|vo dialog qinlq005 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I hereby declare that every son and daughter of the City of the Wind must be compelled to taste this finest of wines... Here's to good wine!

;(Talk to Jean upstairs)
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Oh, it is you.
:{{DIcon}} There you are.
:{{DIcon}} Are you having a good time?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Yes, I am just... getting some air.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, it seems like something's bothering Jean.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' (Traveler), I want to thank you again&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I knew nothing about this whole thing either.
::{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 04a.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Either way, it is good to be here together with everyone. It has lifted my spirits.
:{{DIcon}} You're looking more upbeat now.
::{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 04b.ogg}} '''Jean:''' It is good to be here together with everyone. It has lifted my spirits.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' And it has taught me something.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's that?
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I am definitely more of a Dandelion Knight than a Lionfang Knight.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' The Lionfang Knight represents Vennessa's past &mdash; a past in which she fought hard for Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' But it was the Dandelion Knight that represented her hopes for the future &mdash; a future belonging to the newly formed Knights of Favonius...
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Jean, Vennessa would be so proud of who you are right now.
:{{DIcon}} Jean, Vennessa would be so proud of who you are right now.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I do believe that Vennessa watches over us, whether from high up above, or from the wind all around us.
:{{DIcon}} Let the Wind lead.
:{{A|vo qinlq005 8 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Let the Wind lead. The winds of freedom will guide us along the path that lies ahead. I hope you will continue to join us on that path, (Traveler).

==Trivia==
* "Lionfang" and "Dandelion" both translate to "Löwenzahn" making both title virtually identical in German underlining the dual nature of these titles.
