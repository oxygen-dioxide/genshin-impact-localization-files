|description    = A simple fence made from Brightwood and vines that has an upside-down triangular pattern. It is said that [[Forest Watchers]] used to set these fences up around no-fishing zones to maintain ecological balance and only opened such areas to fisher-people during specific periods. However, with fishing activity declining, such fences have seen far less use. Most people only use these fences around the vicinity of their villages.
