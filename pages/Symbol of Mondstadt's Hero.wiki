The '''Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero''' is the name of the massive oak tree at [[Windrise]]. It is believed to have grown after [[Vennessa]] ascended to [[Celestia]] around a thousand years ago.

==Overview==
A thousand years ago, Vennessa led the rebellion that overthrew the corrupt [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]] and became known as the hero of Mondstadt. According to legend, at the end of her life, she ascended to Celestia in reward for her great deeds. Following her ascension, the towering oak tree rose at the place where she ascended.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Dr. Edith}}</ref><ref name="Leaves Wind">{{Ref/Quest|Leaves on the Wind}}</ref>

After [[Venti]] witnessed the [[Traveler]]'s presence purify [[Dvalin]]'s teardrop, he thought of "a friend so dear" and runs off to the "Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|That Green Fellow}}</ref> When the Traveler finds him sitting on the branches of the tree, Venti remarks that he could feel the [[Abyssal Corruption|Abyssal poison]] being removed from his body after it transferred into him when his attempt to communicate with Dvalin was interrupted.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Let the Wind Lead (Quest)}}</ref> After [[Signora]] rips his [[Gnosis]] from his chest and [[Barbara]]'s healing powers fail to have any effect on him, Venti instead returns to the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero to recuperate.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref>

While conducting research into the power of "wind," Dr. Edith attempts to investigate the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero and posts a commission to gather help. The Traveler brings back some leaves from the tree, which turn out to carry some [[Anemo]] elemental power.<ref name="Leaves Wind" />
