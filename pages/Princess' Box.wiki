The '''Princess's Box''' is one of three boxes discovered in the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] [[Dragonspine's Last Trio]], alongside the [[Priest's Box]] and the [[Scribe's Box]]. The three boxes are used to unlock the [[Secret Room|Secret Room Gate]], which will also remove all three boxes from the player's Inventory.

It is found in a [[Chest|Luxurious Chest]] obtained by completing the [[Time Trial Challenge]] located on a small island east of the [[Frostbearing Tree]], activated by a sword in the ground beneath a tree. The challenge involves defeating two [[Cryo Abyss Mage]]s and one [[Hydro Abyss Mage]] within 60 seconds.

==Trivia==
* Portions of the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr]]'s monologue in the item description are used in [[Snow-Tombed Starsilver]]'s description, which also reveals that they were her last words. The small island was where she attempted to graft branches of the shattered Frostbearing Tree, which failed to survive. She succumbed to the cold, and Ukko later found her and buried her.
