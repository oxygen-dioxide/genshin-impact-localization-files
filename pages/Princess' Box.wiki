|description  = A treasure box with a decorative pattern at the bottom. The ornamentation seems to be a part of a three-piece motif. Once the pattern is completed, a certain door may open.<br />"I'm afraid I can't finish the fresco".<br />"It's been a while since I last saw the blue sky and green grass. I don't know which hues to use to capture the landscape of thawing ice and snow that my father so longs for."<br />"By the time he comes back, everything will be back to how it was. But I can't take this cold anymore."<br />"Forgive me, Father. [[Ukko]], I'm sorry you had to see us like this."<br />"[[Imunlaukr]], I wish I could see you again..."

The '''Princess' Box''' is used together with the [[Priest's Box]] and the [[Scribe's Box]] to unlock the [[Secret Room|Secret Room Gate]]. After opening the gate, all three boxes will be removed from your inventory.

It is found in a [[Chest|Luxurious chest]] obtained by clearing a challenge activated by a sword in the ground beneath a tree on a small island east of the [[Frostbearing Tree]]. The challenge has two Cryo [[Abyss Mages]] and one Hydro Abyss Mage, who you have to defeat within 60 seconds.
