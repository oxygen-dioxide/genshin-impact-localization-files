'''Wind, Courage, and Wings''' is a Quest Item obtained from the quest [[Glide With the Wind]].

==Text==
When the first wisp of wind brushed across the land

Birds that yearned for the sky had wings

But no way to fly

They asked the [[Barbatos|Anemo God]]:

"How can we reach the heavens?"

To which the Anemo God replied:

"You have yet to find that which is most important"

As the God spoke, the wind thrust the seeds of a dandelion

High into the sky

The birds thrust out their wings

But the breeze was all too mild

Leaving them to stumble across the earth

So they went to the gorge

Where the wind showed off its wild and incomparable strength

They threw themselves off the cliff

And flapped their wings amongst the howling winds

Until they were able to fly freely in the sky

To the Anemo God they went, to gleefully say:

"We understand now! All we needed was a stronger wind to fly"

In reply the Anemo God said:

"What you lacked was not wind, but courage"

"It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world"
