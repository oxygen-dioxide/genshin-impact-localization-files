==Lore==
Kongamato is a massive [[Yumkasaurus]] that has lived since the [[cataclysm]]. His human companion was [[Burkina]]. During the cataclysm, the two fought off against the Abyss, though its energies would severely infest Kongamato. In a fit of rage, Kongamato killed Burkina, who passed down part of his powers and blood to him. Kongamato felt great shame after the event, wishing to be put out of its misery. Due to the Abyssal energy infesting it, Kongamato was able to live well over the expected life span of a normal Yumkasaur.

Kongamato would be placed in a cavern, where tribesmen from the [[Scions of the Canopy]] would perform a Turnfire Ritual meant to drain part of Kongamato's energy to ensure it would continue to live and also prevent the energy from overwhelming it in the same time. By the time the Traveler arrives at Natlan, the tribe was about to perform another ceremony as the energy had been accumulating at a much faster rate than usual. As [[Kinich]] appeared to have no interest in the ritual, [[Trinidad]] asked the Traveler to take his place, which they did. When the ritual began, Kinich arrived with his own solution &mdash; a [[Beastly Rift]] provided by [[Enjou]], which Kinich and the Traveler cleared of [[Riftwolf|riftwolves]]. Kinich would intend to place Kongamato in the rift, as he realized that the tribe was indecisive over what to do with Kongamato and it would cause further trouble if not dealt with.

On the day of the ritual, Kinich revealed his plan to the other tribespeople in attendance, much to their opposition, though [[Wayna]] eventually relented. On the other hand, [[Trinidad]], who believed that they were going to kill Kongamato, broke the device Kinich was using, rousing Kongamato from its slumber. Grabbing its attention by offering to be a sacrifice, Kongamato launched a fireball at Trinidad at the Turnfire brazier, knocking him out and severely burning him.

After a short battle, Kongamato appeared to have regained some of its sanity and rather than continue the fight, smashed into the Turnfire brazier and begged to be put out of its misery to end the tribe's humiliation. Kinich, who did not want Kongamato to die, told Kongamato that it had to live with its shame. Due to being engulfed by the Turnfire, Kongamato began to resonate with Kinich, calling him an heir to the Turnfire. Kongamato declared to Kinich that it would use its "ruined" vessel to train future heroes and its will would continue on until the Abyss was stamped out of Natlan.

A quick check-up the day after revealed that a strange shell now surrounded Kongamato, which the tribe elders concluded served as a scab to protect Kongamato from both leaking and absorbing Abyssal energy at the same time. Kinich also reported that Kongamato would still rouse from slumber when its territory was disturbed, but its attacks were as less aggressive than before.

Prior to the Traveler's descent to the Night Kingdom, Kongamato appeared alongside Kinich as a projection. Recalling the words he said to Kinich and the Traveler, Kongamato revealed that he saw Burkina in his dreams, who believed that the upcoming battle would be the one to end all battles and urged him to support the hero of the present &mdash; the Traveler. He noted that the Traveler had a similar presence to the one who moved Burkina to their side, and was confident that they could defeat the forces of darkness.
