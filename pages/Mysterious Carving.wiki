'''Mysterious Carvings''' are ancient bird-like statues and wall reliefs found on [[Tsurumi Island]], [[Inazuma]].

Activating the carvings using the [[Peculiar Pinion]] gadget can have various effects:
* Reliving visions of Tsurumi Island's past inhabitants
* Spawning [[Electro Cube]]s
* Spawning [[Elemental Monument]]s
* Spawning [[Stormstone]]s
* Spawning [[Thunder Sakura Bough]]s
* Causing [[Ishine Script]] to appear on nearby walls
* Opening walls with the bird-shaped imprint on it

Note that only active (lit-up) statues can be interacted with the Pinion. If a statue is inactive (dimmed) you first need to find a nearby source of Electro to power it, before it can be interacted with. Likewise it is possible to confuse inactive statues with similar smaller ones scattered throughout the island, which are instead purely ornamental and do not have any crystals on them.

Completing at least 10 puzzles originating from these statues grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Thunderbird's Lineage]]."
