{{Description|[[Enkanomiya]] has been wrapped up by a darkness of unknown origin. For the sake of [[Watatsumi Island]]'s future, [[Kokomi]] commissions you to once again head down to Enkanomiya...}}
'''Three Realms Gateway Offering''' is a [[Flagship Event]] in [[Version 2.5]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2022/02/17 10:00 until the end of Version 2.5 (2022/03/30 5:59)

===Requirements===
* Reach [[Adventure Rank]] 30 or above
* Complete the [[Archon Quest]]: "[[Chapter II]]: Act II - [[Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow]]"
* Complete the [[World Quest]] "[[Erebos' Secret]]"

===Summary===
* During the event, you can explore the [[The Encroaching Dark|darkness]]-covered [[Enkanomiya]], using [[Light Realm Sigil]]s to upgrade your [[Bokuso Box]]. Upgrade your Bokuso Box to a certain level to obtain [[Oathsworn Eye]] (Catalyst) and its refinement materials, and rewards such as [[Crown of Insight]]. Complete the Event exploration quests to obtain [[Primogem]]s, [[Weapon Ascension Materials]], and more.
* During the event, you can explore the darkness-covered Enkanomiya. There are different Corrosion Intensities in different areas of the region. When the Bokuso Box's Corrosion Resistance is lower than an area's Corrosion Intensity, your party will be exposed to Corrosion — which will accumulate over time and drain the energy of your Bokuso Box. Choose the "Recuperate" option at the statue to clear the accumulated Corrosion.
* Travelers can obtain Light Realm Sigils by opening chests, unlocking Teleport Waypoints, completing exploration objectives, and playing through the "Sentou Trial." Offer the Light Realm Sigils at the statue to upgrade the Bokuso Box and strengthen its Corrosion Resistance. After upgrading the Bokuso Box to a certain level, you will obtain Oathsworn Eye (Catalyst) and its refinement materials, Crown of Insight, Hero's Wit, and other rewards.
* When completing event exploration objectives through exploration or offerings, you can also obtain rewards such as Primogems, Weapon Ascension Materials, and Mora. You can view all exploration objectives and current completion status in the event details page.
* "The Call of Ice and Thunder" challenge will unlock upon completing the quest "[[Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath]]." The challenge has three difficulty levels: Normal, Hard, and Extreme. Lower difficulties will be automatically cleared upon completing the challenge at a higher difficulty. Complete the challenge at corresponding difficulties to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Hero's Wit, and Mora.
* After completing the quest "Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath," you can accept the quest "[[The Bunkoku Enigma]]." Complete the quest to obtain rewards such as [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], and [[Mora]]. After the end of Version 2.5, you will no longer be able to complete the World Quest "The Bunkoku Enigma." Please complete the quest to claim the rewards in time.
* After the end of Version 2.5, you will no longer be able to travel to the Three Realms Gateway Offering area to open chests and obtain challenge rewards. Please explore the area and claim the rewards in time.
* After the end of Version 2.5, the gadget "Bokuso Box" will disappear from your Inventory.

==Rite of Diffusal==
{{See also|Corrupted Waypoints}}
Most waypoints have been sealed within this darkened Enkanomiya and thus cannot be used. Once the Bokuso Box reaches a certain level, a fixed amount of [[Aphotic Ore]] and [[Tokoyo Legume]]s can be used to perform the Rite of Diffusal and restore the waypoints' functions.

==Trivia==
* Players cannot lock themselves out of completing Aphotic Diffusal, as exploration alone provides enough Light Sigils for the Bokuso Box to be upgraded to have high enough Corrosion Resistance for players to access all areas comfortably.
===Etymology===
* The Chinese and Japanese versions use the historical term {{lang|Michiae-no-Matsuri|ja=道饗祭|ja_lit=Road Feast Festival}} to refer to this offering. The Michiae-no-Matsuri was an ancient Shinto rite to protect Kyoto, then-capital of Japan, from evil spirits and plagues, by performing a ritual and holding a religious feast at each of the four corners of the capital.<ref name="kotobank">Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/%E9%81%93%E9%A5%97%E7%A5%AD-138785 {{Ja|道饗祭|rm=Michiae-no-Matsuri}}]</ref>
