==Profile==
Several years before the [[Traveler]]'s arrival, Nepecha was orphaned and taken in by an [[Ancient Name]] forger named [[Tlazolli]], whose own daughter [[Nechca]] had died the same day in an [[Abyss]] attack.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wailing Cacophony|quote='''Tlazolli:''' [Nepecha]'s a child from my tribe. Her parents were killed in that same Abyss attack, but wouldn't you know it... Her birthday is the same as that of my Nechca.}}</ref> Tlazolli passed her off as Nechca to other members of the tribe, claiming that she was seriously injured on the day of the accident rather than killed. To explain why "Nechca" lacked her memories from before the accident, she said that Abyssal energy in her wounds resulted in memory loss. When Nepecha started attempting to reveal the truth to people, Tlazolli isolated her, claiming that the Abyssal corruption left her seriously ill. She audited her letters and closely monitored her when they were in public together. Tlazolli also frequently administered a "medicine" to Nepecha that would make her sleepy for days at a time, and make it difficult to remember things.

Tlazolli used her forging skills to create Blazegem Inscriptions to steal memories of Nechca from the other members of the tribe, in order to overwrite Nepecha's own memories so that she would believe she was truly Tlazolli's daughter. Just as this plan was about to come to fruition, [[Xilonen]] and the Traveler discovered the truth. Tlazolli fled with Nepecha to her workshop and attempted the memory transfer, but Xilonen and the Traveler intervened and were able to purge the effects of the Inscriptions on Nepecha's mind. Afterward, Nechca's spirit appeared to Tlazolli and Nepecha to share some final words of comfort to them.

After this ordeal, Xilonen brought Nepecha to her own home to stay. As she had spent years under Tlazolli's influence, living the life of Nechca, she was unsure of her own identity and what to do from now on. Xilonen promised to help her rediscover her past.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wailing Cacophony}}</ref>

Upon learning that the Traveler was descending into the Night Kingdom, Nepecha asked Xilonen to bring her to them, wanting to see them again. She conveyed her blessings to them, hoping that they would be victorious in the upcoming battle.

===Appearance===
Nepecha is a young girl with olive skin, freckles, brown hair tied in pigtails, and dark gray eyes. She has rounded light brown cat ears.

==Trivia==
* ''Nepecha'' is possibly derived from the {{w|Nahuatl}} word ''[https://nahuatl.wired-humanities.org/content/nop%C4%93ca Nopēca]'' which means “there” to a place out of sight.
**Additionally, the NPC [[Nechca]] who she was mistaken for also means “there” in Nahuatl.
* Nepecha shares the same birthday as Nechca.
