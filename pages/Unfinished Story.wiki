;(Talk to Ann)
;(If the player didn't interact with the book in the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]] before the completion of [[Mary-Ann's Story]])
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa, what is this place? Paimon's dizzy from that whole... getting sucked into the book... thing.
::'''Ann:''' I remember this place. I know it. This is [[The Narzissenkreuz Ordo|the Narzissenkreuz Ordo]].
::'''Paimon:''' It sure does feel like we've been transported to all sorts of strange places under weird circumstances after meeting Ann, huh?
::'''Ann:''' Sorry, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, it's fine. Paimon's not blaming you &mdash; she just thinks, uh, that Fontaine really is a magical place!
::'''Paimon:''' Still, this is the Narzissenkreuz Ordo... Sounds like an organization the people from the Kingdom would set up in a different country!
::'''Ann:''' ...
::'''Paimon:''' The method of entry was pretty interesting too, huh! It was just like that picture book in the Annapausis... We read and read... and then we ended up somewhere else!
;(If the player interacted with the book in the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]] before the completion of [[Mary-Ann's Story]])
::'''Paimon:''' Here we are, [[The Narzissenkreuz Ordo|the Narzissenkreuz Ordo]].
::'''Ann:''' ...
::'''Ann:''' I remember this place. I know it. This is indeed the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
::'''Paimon:''' Right? We found this place previously as well.
::{{DIcon}} It's just like what happened with the book in the Annapausis...
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's right! We read and read... and poof, we shodwed up in a total different spot!
:'''Paimon:''' That... makes this place something like a secret base, doesn't it? We don't even know where it really is, either...
:{{DIcon}} Are you feeling more calm now, Ann?
:'''Ann:''' Yes, much better. Thank you, Knight {{Traveler}}...
:'''Ann:''' ...Or should I drop that title? It was all fake, after all...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't say that, Ann...
:'''Ann:''' But...
:{{DIcon}} On the contrary, your story has only just begun.
:{{DIcon}} On the contrary, our story has only just begun.
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}'s right, y'know. We've still got a whole bunch of adventures waiting up ahead for us!
:'''Paimon:''' Ahem. And... how shall one proceed in peace of mind without a reliable knight at hand, oh lovely maiden?
:{{DIcon}} Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} You're getting tired, Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon! Paimon was just trying to encourage Ann...
:'''Ann:''' Pfft...
:'''Ann:''' You're quite the knight yourself, Paimon. You're positive, and you've got a good heart. It makes me happy, truly.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Oh, c'mon, why're you getting so serious all of a sudden...
:'''Ann:''' You're just less powerful than Knight {{Traveler}}, that's all.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph. Everyone's got things they're good at! {{Traveler}}'s got a good brain and sword-arm, and Paimon... Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} ...A powerful eater?
::'''Paimon:''' And that goes to show just how strong she is!
:{{DIcon}} ...Has powerfully white hair?
::'''Paimon:''' Yup, and that's a real symbol of purity!
:{{DIcon}} ...Is a powerful giver of nicknames?
::'''Paimon:''' Yup, that's Paimon &mdash; a gifted speaker indeed!
:{{DIcon}} You really are impressive, Paimon. See...
::{{DIcon}} You've cheered Ann up already.
::'''Ann:''' Yes, you truly are impressive, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' You two... And here Paimon thought that you'd try to tease her or something...
::'''Paimon:''' You're weird &mdash; yup, both of you! Hmph...
:'''Paimon:''' But that aside, didn't you say before that the "Narzissenkreuz Ordo has deep links with the past," Ann? That's why we came in the first place.
:'''Ann:''' Yes. However, my head's still a complete mess...
:'''Paimon:''' That's true... Hmm, Paimon knows! Let's put what we've discovered together real quick. When we were exploring the Annapausis...
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Oh boy, Paimon's head's a mess too. Any ideas, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Let's discuss Ann...
::'''Paimon:''' Right, Paimon's been thinking about that, too. "Mary-Ann" said that your birth was a "beautiful accident." What does that mean?
::'''Ann:''' I think it might simply be that my birth was a coincidence. Just as she said, I am someone she dreamed of &mdash; the form she took in the dream.
::'''Ann:''' The things we experienced together were also part of the tale in the dream. If it hadn't been for you, that dream might never have ended...
::'''Ann:''' Or perhaps it might have ended, and I might have disappeared with the "happily ever after." I can't be sure.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true...
::'''Paimon:''' ...Not that Paimon gets it!
::{{DIcon}} This means that "Mary-Ann" is also an Oceanid.
::'''Paimon:''' Eh?
::{{DIcon}} And Ann was created from "Mary-Ann."
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? Eh?
::'''Ann:''' That's what I believe as well. And if that's the case, the things I remembered during our journey should have been her memories... Or so I'd think.
::{{DIcon}} Your knowledge and experience cannot exceed that of the main body.
:::{{DIcon}} But when you met her, "you" also became your own entity.
::::{{DIcon}} Without a main body to restrict and control you.
::'''Ann:''' So... "become the master of your own fate"... Her last words to me...
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, okay, Paimon gets it now. So, that means that Petit Chou, Al, and the others are creations just like you, right?
::'''Ann:''' I believe that to be the case, yes.
::{{DIcon}} In that case, who was "Mary-Ann," really?
::'''Ann:''' ...This name is very familiar to me.
::'''Ann:''' But I cannot recall why &mdash; it's like some part of my body has been frozen.
::'''Paimon:''' Any other thoughts, {{Traveler}}?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Let's discuss the Narzissenkreuz Ordo...
::'''Ann:''' Alright. I now have a lot of thoughts on the matter &mdash; memories and emotions.
::'''Ann:''' When those two children brought me here, it was a lovely place. Everything was new and shiny, just as before.
::'''Ann:''' They were vibrant and excited, like the sunlight shining on the water. They told me that this was our new home, and that they'd brought many new friends. That everything could be like they were before.
::'''Ann:''' But later, they changed. Some things stopped being the same, and the people here changed, too.
::'''Ann:''' Though the Narzissenkreuz Institute of old did not have sunlight, it was very warm. Yet, this place grew ever colder. And then... then...
::'''Paimon:''' Ann...
::'''Ann:''' ...
::'''Paimon:''' Ann looks like she's in pain, {{Traveler}}...
::{{DIcon}} Can you recall anything else?
::{{DIcon}} No need to push yourself.
::'''Ann:''' I'm sorry, Knight {{Traveler}}... As for the rest, each time I try to recall it, I grow very frightened... and very sad. This is the best I can do for now.
::'''Ann:''' I can sense that many terrible things happened here. I can sense many emotions &mdash; rage, terror, but also hope, trust, and admiration.
::'''Ann:''' But all of them make me feel a strange sort of pain, like there are all sorts of shards or impurities embedded in my body. I don't want to... I can't...
::'''Paimon:''' Alright, alright! Leave that aside first &mdash; there's no need to force it. The more you try to force yourself to remember, the less you'll be able to remember!
::'''Paimon:''' Any other thoughts, {{Traveler}}?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Let's discuss Princess Lyris...
::'''Ann:''' I suspect that she was only ever a character in a story. In that tale, we needed to save her and defeat the fell dragon Narcissus.
::'''Ann:''' That was my original {{Rubi|purpose|wish}}.
::{{DIcon}} All stories must have their origins.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Speaking of that, Ann, we've heard you mention a place called the Narzissenkreuz Institute before...
::'''Paimon:''' So if we go with {{Traveler}}'s logic, the Narzissenkreuz Kingdom and Adventure Team might have their stories' origin in the Institute and the Ordo, right?
::'''Ann:''' That is... possible.
::'''Paimon:''' Any other thoughts, {{Traveler}}?
:;(Return to option selection)

;(After selecting all 3 options)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm. It feels like we got our hands on some new clues, but then again not...
:'''Ann:''' Actually, I've recalled something else.
:'''Ann:''' I've seen terrifying sights. The primordial waters, the amniotic fluid of the world, and its placenta, devoured to the last. The world fell into utter darkness &mdash; never again would the cool spring water flow.
:'''Ann:''' I saw that once. Or perhaps I saw that in the future.
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Wait a second. Which are you talking about? The past or the future?
:'''Ann:''' I... don't know.
:'''Ann:''' Sorry, and thank you, Knight {{Traveler}}, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Come on, it's fine. We said we were gonna help you!
:'''Ann:''' No. I truly am happy that the two of you are the first two friends I met since I became "me." For that, you have my thanks.
:{{DIcon}} Pleased to have met you too, Ann.
:{{DIcon}} Don't mention it.
:'''Paimon:''' Gah, why are the two of you being so... formal?
:'''Paimon:''' Isn't becoming friends something that just, y'know, happens? When you called out to us and asked for our help, Ann, that was the moment Paimon thought &mdash; that's right, you're our friend, and we've gotta help you!
:'''Ann:''' *sniff* Thank you so much, Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't be like that, Ann. If you really wanna thank us, then keep your chin up, and keep those spirits high!
:'''Ann:''' Yes... Yes! You're exactly right, Paimon.
:'''Ann:''' Besides, I have your help &mdash; I shouldn't waste it by standing still. I must recall more, and tell you all about it.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, not that you have to push yourself too hard to recall the past...
;(If both ''[[The Final Question]]'' and ''[[Riddles Awaiting Answers]]'' have been completed)
::'''Caterpillar:''' Ah, an Oceanid. It's been a long time since I last saw one of your kind.
::'''Seymour:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, I detect the biological signature of an Oceanid.
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, allow Paimon to introduce you... This is our Oceanid friend, Ann. Ann, these two are Caterpillar and...
::'''Ann:''' ...I know &mdash; and Seymour, the silly dog.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm?
::'''Seymour:''' Relevant data does not exist. I do not believe we have had the honor of meeting, Oceanid Ann.
::'''Ann:''' I've never met you before, either. But I was sure of it the moment I saw you &mdash; you must be Seymour.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, what's going on here?
::'''Ann:''' This must be... No, I don't know, either. This is so strange...
::'''Seymour:''' Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
::{{DIcon}} Anyway, let's bring you up to speed...
::{{Black Screen|You share some information...}}
::'''Ann:''' So, you're searching for Mary-Ann, Seymour...
::'''Paimon:''' Agh! No wonder that name felt familiar! The person Seymour mentioned and is looking for also goes by that name!
::'''Seymour:''' Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Ugh, Paimon's had it with you, you silly dog!
::'''Paimon:''' Hmmm... Based on what you said before, they can't be the same Mary-Ann, right? The timing...
::'''Seymour:''' I deduce from your statement, then, that you have met someone named Mary-Ann in the past, or have perhaps read or heard about such a person from sources aside from myself?
::'''Paimon:''' Well, that was her name, that's for sure. Y'know what, let's do it like this &mdash; we can call the Mary-Ann in the Annapausis "Mary-Ann 1," and the one you're looking for, Seymour, can be "Mary-Ann 2"!
::'''Seymour:''' Negative. The Ms. Mary-Ann I am searching for is of a higher sequential priority. To prevent confusion, she should be "Mary-Ann 1" instead.
::'''Ann:''' Huh? Why don't you look at it this way, Seymour. 2 is bigger than 1. Doesn't that make it pretty good, too?
::'''Seymour:''' Your claim... Sorting data fragments.
::{{DIcon}} Uh, looks like he's stopped functioning again...
::'''Ann:''' Hehe, silly dog.
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon didn't think you had any mean bones in you, Ann, but you sure do!
::'''Ann:''' Haha. I don't know why, but I suddenly felt compelled to do that...
::'''Seymour:''' Preliminary data fragment sorting complete. For the following 15 reasons, Oceanid Ann, I assess that your perspective is illogical. Firstly&mdash;
::'''Ann:''' Alright, alright, that stuff doesn't matter. Come, good doggie, sit.
::'''Seymour:''' Understood.
::'''Seymour:''' ...Why?
::'''Ann:''' If you sit, we'll be able to improve photo-taking stability, right?
::'''Seymour:''' Yes. Do you need to take a photo, Oceanid Ann? I am equipped with the most advanced optics from the Fontaine Institute of Natural Philosophy. I can&mdash;
::'''Ann:''' Oh, there's no need, but thank you.
::'''Seymour:''' Understood.
::{{DIcon}} Let's get serious now, shall we...
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa, Seymour was completely being played by Ann! Anyway, you two have been acquainted now, right?
::'''Ann:''' Yeah. Still, Caterpillar... have we ever met before?
::'''Caterpillar:''' My memory is fading, so that is quite possible. If I may be so blunt, what is your relationship with the Red Empress?
::'''Ann:''' The Red Empress? I have no idea who that is, though the name kind of rings a bell.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Then let me try another name... What is your relationship with Lyris?
::'''Ann:''' ...How do you know that name?
::'''Ann:''' I went through many adventures with Paimon and Knight {{Traveler}}, only to find that she was merely a character in a story.
::{{DIcon}} What's going on here?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, what's going on? Do you know Lyris, Caterpillar?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Do I? Hmm. Ah. I think I know what's going on.
::'''Caterpillar:''' I'm also a victim of riddles, so I shan't play dumb &mdash; I'll tell you everything I know.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Lyris did indeed exist. She was an Oceanid as well, and Narzissenkreuz's name for her within the Ordo was the "Red Empress."
::'''Paimon:''' Wait? What? So what happened to her?
::'''Caterpillar:''' I don't know, though I do have a hunch.
::'''Ann:''' Can you tell me?
::'''Caterpillar:''' It's just a small guess. But the story about the Narzissenkreuz Kingdom that you two mentioned, {{Traveler}} and Paimon...
::'''Caterpillar:''' Let's just say that I think we can use it as a reference of sorts.
::'''Paimon:''' Oh... so no progress for us today, huh?
::'''Paimon:''' Still, when we first got here, Paimon couldn't help but notice... The clock here doesn't seem very accurate, does it?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Ah. That.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Simply put, it's the Doomsday Clock.
::{{DIcon}} Doomsday Clock?
::'''Caterpillar:''' When the clock strikes midnight, the apocalypse will come.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Doesn't this mean that the end of the world is almost upon us?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Huh, that really does take me back. When I was here before, they thought the apocalypse was still far away, and that though it wouldn't happen in our generation, we should stop it for the sake of the future.
::'''Caterpillar:''' If the clock is accurate, then it is not far off now. Perhaps we shall lay ourselves down to sleep tonight, and the sun shall not rise in the morn. Perhaps the sea shall evaporate tomorrow.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Or perhaps we are already living in the apocalypse, and the good times have long ended.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Get serious! Will the apocalypse really come?
::'''Caterpillar:''' What we're seeing is a doomsday clock, not doomsday itself. Time is just an invention by man to measure changes.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Narzissenkreuz was the one who used the "world-formula" to calculate the beginning of the end, and built this device.
::'''Caterpillar:''' As such, I cannot answer your question, dear Paimon. Because this is all it is &mdash; a clock.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true...
::{{DIcon}} Anyway, let's share our findings...
::{{Black Screen|You and Paimon briefly share all that happened with the other three people (though technically speaking, none of them are humans).}}
::'''Seymour:''' Input logged.
::'''Ann:''' Elynas...
::{{DIcon}} Do you remember anything else?
::'''Ann:''' I don't know. I'm not sure. It's like water boiling off into gas. I can't see it, and I can't quite grasp it, either.
::'''Paimon:''' Oh. Any thoughts or leads, Caterpillar?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Hmm... Can't say that I don't, but I'm still trying to sort some things out, so let's discuss this later.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Oh, I keep forgetting to ask...
::'''Caterpillar:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, I'm very grateful for everything you've done for Lanoire. So, is there anything that I can help you with?
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Do you mean... anything? Just like making a wish?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Haha! It should be something within the scope of my abilities, of course. You did free Lanoire and I from prison, but I'm no Jinn in a bottle.
::{{DIcon}} So, what would your wish be, Paimon?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, if that's the case, then Mora... No, wait, yummy food...
::'''Paimon:''' Argh! Paimon wants lots of things, but...
::'''Paimon:''' We've been having lots of fun traveling together, so we don't really need anything special. Instead, Caterpillar, can you help us help Ann and Seymour?
::'''Ann:''' Paimon...
::'''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Is that alright?
::{{DIcon}} It's decided then.
::{{DIcon}} I don't mind.
::'''Caterpillar:''' I understand. Then, let us work together.
::'''Ann:''' Alright!
::'''Seymour:''' Understood.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Now, I plan to work with Seymour and Ann to see if we can use our experiences and the information available here to figure something new out. {{Traveler}}, Paimon, let's meet back here later.
;(If ''The Final Question'' has been completed but not ''Riddles Awaiting Answers'')
::'''Ann:''' There is a chance that I might be able to think of some lovely things. If I do, you'll be the first to know, Knight {{Traveler}}, Paimon.
::'''Seymour:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, I detect an Oceanid's biological signature.
::'''Paimon:''' Gah! You finally woke up!
::'''Seymour:''' Negative. My various previous clockwork cycles were spent collating fragmented data and searching for useful information.
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, not that we're gonna be able to see any of the photos inside, will we?
::'''Seymour:''' Affirmative.
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, yes, let Paimon introduce you. This is Ann, an Oceanid and a friend of ours. Ann, this is...
::'''Ann:''' ...I know. You're the silly dog, Seymour.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh?
::'''Seymour:''' I lack the relevant data. I do not believe we have had the honor of meeting, Oceanid Ann.
::'''Ann:''' I've never met you before, either. But I was sure of it the moment I saw you &mdash; you must be Seymour.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, what's going on here?
::'''Ann:''' This must be... No, I don't know, either. I feel... strange...
::'''Seymour:''' Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
::{{DIcon}} Anyway, let us bring you up to speed...
::{{Black Screen|You shed a little light on the matters so far...}}
::'''Ann:''' So, Seymour is searching for Mary-Ann...
::'''Paimon:''' Agh! No wonder that name felt familiar! The person Seymour mentioned and is looking for is also named Mary-Ann!
::'''Seymour:''' Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Ugh, Paimon's had it with you, you silly dog!
::'''Paimon:''' Hmmm... According to what Seymour said before, they can't be the same Mary-Ann, right? The timing...
::'''Seymour:''' Based on your statement, may I deduce that you have met someone named Mary-Ann in the past, or perhaps read or heard about such a person from sources apart from myself?

::'''Ann:''' Oh, there's no need, but thank you.
::'''Seymour:''' Understood.
::'''Paimon:''' Wow, Seymour's getting played left and right over here!
::{{DIcon}} Let's call a quick halt, please...
:::'''Paimon:''' Really... Anyway, wanna go to the Annapausis, Seymour? That way, you can meet that "Mary-Ann" and see if she's the one you're looking for or not.
::{{DIcon}} Do you want to go to the Annapausis, Seymour?
:::'''Paimon:''' Yeah. That way, you can meet that "Mary-Ann" and see if she's the one you're looking for or not!
::'''Ann:''' What you say makes sense, Paimon.
::'''Seymour:''' Affirmative. A reasonable suggestion.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, then let's go!
::'''Ann:''' Actually, Knight {{Traveler}}, Paimon, I don't think we'll need to trouble you this time. I can show Seymour the way!
::{{DIcon}} Are you sure you'll be fine?
:::'''Ann:''' Yes. I know Seymour's very reliable.
::{{DIcon}} Take care, now.
::'''Paimon:''' Okay! We'll meet back here later, alright?
;(If ''Riddles Awaiting Answers'' has been completed but not ''The Final Question'')
::'''Ann:''' I can probably come up with some nice things, and if I do, I will share them with you first, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Ah, an Oceanid. It's been a long time since I last saw one of your kind.
::'''Paimon:''' Wow! You're back, Caterpillar! How are things? Have you found anything?
::'''Caterpillar:''' The sunshine and the wind feel so good. Everything else seems normal.
::'''Ann:''' So... there's basically nothing?
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, allow Paimon to introduce you two. This is our Oceanid friend, Ann. Ann, this is...
::'''Caterpillar:''' My name is Caterpillar. A pleasure to meet you, Ann.
::'''Ann:''' Likewise, Caterpillar... Huh. Have we met?
::'''Caterpillar:''' My memory is fading, so that is quite possible. If I may be so blunt, what is your relationship with the Red Empress?
::'''Ann:''' The Red Empress? I have no idea who that is, though the name kind of rings a bell.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Then let me try another name... What is your relationship with Lyris?
::'''Ann:''' How do you know that name?
::'''Ann:''' I went through many adventures with Paimon and Knight {{Traveler}}, only to find that she was merely a character in a story.
::{{DIcon}} What's going on here?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, what's going on? Do you know Lyris, Caterpillar?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Do I? Hmm. Ah. I think I know what's going on.
::'''Caterpillar:''' I'm also a victim of riddles, so I shan't play dumb &mdash; I'll tell you everything I know.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Lyris did indeed exist. She was an Oceanid as well, and Narzissenkreuz's name for her within the Ordo was the "Red Empress."
::'''Paimon:''' Wait? What? So what happened to her?
::'''Caterpillar:''' I don't know, though I do have a hunch.
::'''Ann:''' Can you tell me?
::'''Caterpillar:''' I fear this hunch isn't worth bringing up. Besides, I suspect that you've already figured it out, being as smart as you are. Am I wrong?
::'''Paimon:''' Figured what out?
::'''Ann:''' The first thing you said to me...
::{{DIcon}} "My name is Caterpillar..."
::'''Ann:''' No, the next line!
::'''Ann:''' What my relation to the Red Empress &mdash; or Lyris the Oceanid, is...
::'''Paimon:''' In that case, you should visit Mary-Ann in the Annapausis, Caterpillar.
::'''Paimon:''' Maybe that will confirm your hunch.
::'''Caterpillar:''' A reasonable suggestion.
::'''Ann:''' I won't be troubling you this time, Knight {{Traveler}}, Paimon. I'll go with Caterpillar.
::{{DIcon}} Are you sure?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Trust me.
::'''Ann:''' And me.
::'''Paimon:''' Okay, then... We'll see you back here later.
;(If neither ''The Final Question'' nor ''Riddles Awaiting Answers'' have been completed)
::'''Ann:''' It's fine. Just as "Mary-Ann" dreamed of a past tale, and the tale gave birth to me, I will also rest. In dreams, I might be able to recall more things.
::'''Ann:''' Perhaps there might be lovely things there, too. If I do recall some, you'll be the first to know, Knight {{Traveler}}, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' ...Got it. Alright then. Good night, Ann!
::'''Ann:''' Indeed. Good night.

;(Talk to Ann after the quest ends, optional)
::'''Ann:''' ... Ann...
