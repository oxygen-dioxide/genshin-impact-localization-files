'''Energy Concentrating Component''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained from defeating certain "Imperfect Mek" encounters in the [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region]] and [[Liffey Region]]. While these unique enemies respawn, a component is only obtained on their first defeat each.

Seven in total can be collected and then used to open the cell in a [[Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop]] with a [[Luxurious Chest]] inside. Opening this chest will grant player the {{Achievement|The Worst! Fontaine's Eight Evil Clockwork Knights!}}
