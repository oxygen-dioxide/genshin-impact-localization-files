{{Lang|'''Ekaterina'''|ru=Екатерина|ru_rm=Yekaterina}} is a member of the [[Fatui]] and a receptionist at the [[Northland Bank]], a [[Snezhnaya]]n bank opened in [[Liyue]]. Despite claiming that she cannot say whether the Northland Bank is linked to the Fatui, she wears the typical Fatui uniform and serves as [[Childe]]'s subordinate.

If the player has leftover funds from [[Childe]] via the Archon Quest "[[Downtown]]" ([[A Huge Bag of Mora]]) or the Story Quest "[[Teucer's Terrific Tour]]" ([[Childe and Teucer's Mora Pouch]]), they can be exchanged for up to 50,000 [[Mora]] by speaking to Ekaterina.

==Profile==
Ekaterina is the receptionist at the Northland Bank. Despite clearly being a member of the Fatui, if asked about the bank's relation to the Fatui, she declines to directly state any relationship to them, but concedes that the Harbingers use their facilities regularly.

During "[[Guizhong (Archon Quest)|Guizhong]]" in [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]], Ekaterina tails the party and eavesdrops on their conversation with [[Baizhu]] and [[Qiqi]], later reporting on her findings to Childe.

She seems to have some authority within the Fatui, as she was able to dispatch a spy to follow Ningguang after the latter's visit to the bank in [[Endless Smoke]].

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Ekaterina is a woman with brown hair in a braid on the side. She wears female Fatui attire and a mask.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ekaterina:''' Welcome to the Northland Bank. How may I assist you?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to make an exchange... ''(Only available if you have leftover funds from Childe)''
::'''Ekaterina:''' Oh, the elemental energy on this bag of Mora... Indeed, it has been certified by us.
::'''Ekaterina:''' Would you like to change all the coins of outsize value inside to loose change?
::'''Ekaterina:''' As you wish, dear customer.
:;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Ekaterina:''' Me? I am a receptionist at the Northland Bank. If you have business matters to discuss, I can direct you to [[Andrei|our manager]].
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Ekaterina:''' When it comes to interest rates, whether it be for loans and deposits, you will find no other bank more satisfactory than us in all of Liyue...
::'''Ekaterina:''' Of course, should you take a loan from us, do remember to service that loan on time.
::'''Ekaterina:''' I advise you to not take us to be an ordinary bank. We will not have debts go unpaid.
::'''Ekaterina:''' Let me put it this way: have you seen an iceberg? You can only see what floats above the surface. No one can know what lies beneath.
::'''Ekaterina:''' Understand this well, and it will go with you when you do business with us. *chuckles*
::{{DIcon}} As for you and the Fatui...
::'''Ekaterina:''' Do you mean to ask about our relationship with the Fatui? I apologize, but I cannot speak of such secrets.
::'''Ekaterina:''' What I can tell you is that the Fatui [[Harbinger]]s are key clients of ours.
::'''Ekaterina:''' Just as an example, the number of zeroes behind the amount of money that one such as Master Childe has deposited in our coffers would be enough to boggle the mind.
::'''Ekaterina:''' But to ones such as the Harbingers, money is but a number. If they should want anything, I fear there is little to stop them from obtaining it.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ekaterina:''' Goodbye, and may things go well with you. *chuckles*
