{{RegionTabs}}
The nation of [[Liyue]] is marked by its emphasis on "contracts," [[Morax]]'s ideal. It is said that people from all seven nations of [[Teyvat]] flock to [[Liyue Harbor]], the economic hub of the continent.

==Life in Liyue==
===Agriculture===
Compared to [[Mondstadt]]'s lush plains, Liyue's rocky and mountainous geography is less suited for agriculture. Nevertheless, places like [[Qingce Village]] have managed to build terraced [[rice]] fields, whose crops can then be taken to Liyue Harbor to be sold. [[Sunsettia]] trees can be found across Liyue.

Over 3,000 years ago, [[Guili Plains]] and its surrounding areas were bountiful and one of its rulers, [[Guizhong]], led her people in making agriculture their livelihood.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref> However, during the [[Archon War]], the area was destroyed to such an extent that even in modern times, the land has never completely recovered. While some trees and grasses have managed to grow, the land is largely uninhabitable by humans.

===Architecture===
The architecture in Liyue is reminiscent of the style of {{w|Chinese architecture|ancient Chinese architecture}}, with similar color schemes and hints, such as the eaved rooftops of many of the buildings and the warm color palette.

In a study, furnishings must be placed in a specific location and angle. There are apparently three schools of thought and nine areas of specialization on this subject.<ref name="Zhongli">{{Ref/Companion|Zhongli}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Category:Liyue Dishes}}
Liyue has two main culinary styles: the Li style, which focuses on bold, rich flavors using ingredients picked from the mountains, and the Yue style, which favors lighter-flavored seafood.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Xi'er}}</ref> The two styles have a long history in Liyue and have been locked in bitter rivalry for just as long; fans of one style often clash with fans of the other. In Liyue Harbor, [[Liuli Pavilion]] and [[Xinyue Kiosk]] are the most reputable restaurants of their respective styles, and are both located in the city's shopping district, Feiyun Slope.

Chihu Rock, which is the relatively poorer end of the city,<ref group="Note">[[Chongyun]]'s [[Hangout Event]] [[Signs of Evil|Act I]] quest: [[For A Child's Smile]] has Chongyun and the Traveler seek out [[Dalong]], a boy who lives in Chihu Rock; his family is poor and sometimes cannot afford to buy food.</ref> focuses more on street food but has some up-and-coming restaurants of their own, such as [[Wanmin Restaurant]].

===Education===
It appears that education in Liyue largely depends on the person's wealth and social standing. [[Ren'yu]] and [[Lan]] both come from the lower ranks of society; the former is incapable of interpreting simple drawings, while the latter states that she is illiterate and leaves all the business to [[Katheryne]] despite being the guild master. Tutors are implied to be in high demand for more affluent families; [[Xingqiu]] and his sibling(s) are particularly well-educated due to their family's wealth and position.

Apart from general education, some people join "clans" for martial arts training, one of the more known clans being the [[Guhua Clan]].

===Music===
The soundtracks for Liyue contains a lot of string instruments and percussions. The music usually has high, clear notes, and classical Chinese instruments like the erhu, guzheng and dizi are used.

===Technology===
Ancient technology constructed by gods and humans can be seen around Liyue, such as [[Guizhong Ballista]] and [[Dunyu Ruins]].

===Sword Arts===
{{Main|Martial Arts in Teyvat#Liyue}}

==Designs, Motifs, and Symbols==
{{See also|Symbols in Teyvat}}
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are typically seen within Liyue or on Liyue-related parties.

Liyue typically incorporates geometric designs into its architecture and design work. {{w|Meander (art)|Meanders}} are a common decorative design, and diamonds are a common shape in various emblems found throughout Liyue.

===Character Cards===
The overall shape of Liyue Character Cards contains a large circle with a diamond inlaid in the center. Four paper lanterns are on either side of the diamond, with the Liyue Vision shape at top center with the character's element inlaid inside and two Ginkgo leaves on either side of it. The icons inside the paper lanterns vary based on the character's affiliations.

Adepti and adepti-related characters will have icons of Liyue's sacred beasts: a dragon at top left, a stag at top right, a qilin at bottom left, and a crane at bottom right. The characters who have this version are: [[Ganyu]], [[Qiqi]], [[Xiao]], [[Yanfei]], and [[Zhongli]].

Characters who do not use the adepti's version will instead contain emblems representing the notable trade sectors of Liyue Harbor: The [[Mora]] [[triquetra]] at the top left as symbol of the [[Golden House]]'s Mora mint, a [[Silk Flower]] at top right as symbol for the fabric trades such as the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]] as well as for the herbal and pharmaceutical trades such as the [[Bubu Pharmacy]], a ship representing Liyue Harbor's trade fleets and shipyards as well as [[The Crux]] at bottom left, and a sword (specifically [[Prototype Rancour]]) and polearm (either [[Black Tassel]] or [[White Tassel]]) crossed at bottom right as symbol of their smithies and forges such as the [[Blackcliff Forge]].

===Multi-Diamond===
The multi-diamond symbols are likely based on Chinese traditional motif "Fangsheng" (方胜纹).

Alongside the Geo symbol, which naturally represents the Geo Archon, the '''Geo Archon symbol''' ''(unofficial name)'' can be found in places associated with Morax. It is comprised of one central square diamond, with smaller square diamonds at each corner. This symbol can be found at [[Yuehai Pavilion]], where the [[Yiyan Temple]] dedicated to Morax can be found, and on the back of [[Zhongli]]'s clothing. The [[Polearm|"polearm"]] icon also contains the Geo Archon symbol.

The '''triple diamond''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a design motif most prominently seen on the effects of the [[Liyue Series]] weapons, although it can also be seen on places such as [[Xinyan]]'s sleeves. It is comprised of two smaller diamonds surrounding one large diamond, with another shape (typically another diamond) in the center of the large diamond.

Note: The Mondstadt-based [[Millennial Movement Series]] weapons' effect has a similar symbol, but only has two diamonds instead of three.

===Cloud Motif===
A traditional stylised clouds decorative pattern called "{{w|Xiangyun (Auspicious clouds)|Xiangyun}}" (祥云, Auspicious clouds).

==Economy==
Liyue's economy is very reliant on its harbor. They function as a port, where ships come and go for various goods. People from Snezhnaya like [[Ivanovich]] are traders in Liyue, and a fisherman mentioned that he used to import goods from Inazuma over to Liyue before the lockdown. Local Liyue specialties like Chilibrew and silk are known in other countries. The [[Dawn Winery]] sells their beverages to Liyue trading unions and individual merchants, who then resell them inside or to other nations. Liyue used to export a large number of silk to Inazuma for the purpose of making kimonos, although following the lockdown, trade has plummeted significantly.

Liyue also has a vast mining and smithing industry in place. [[Blackcliff Forge]] is where the [[Blackcliff Series|Blackcliff]] and [[Prototype Series]] were made. In addition to creating weapons, the forge also doubles as a mine. [[The Chasm]], the more well-known mine in Liyue, is the primary source of employment for most miners, but following a serious of mysterious accidents, the Liyue Qixing shut the mines down. [[Cor Lapis]], [[Noctilucous Jade]] and Glazed Sand Crystals are ores unique to Liyue.

The nation was also the sole minter of [[Mora]] due to Morax's [[Gnosis]], some of which are kept in the nation, while the rest are sent to the other nations. However, he eventually gave up his Gnosis per an agreement with the [[Tsaritsa]]; in the process, he also forgot to find an alternative plan, resulting in no new Mora being circulated for the time being.

==Fashion==
The fashion in Liyue seems to also take inspiration from Chinese fashion such as the cheongsam and the hanfu. It should be noted that clothing styles of Liyue are based on no particular dynasties, though they all are inspired by Chinese culture.

===Men's Fashion===

[[Suling]] has a customized fifth version which forgoes the shirt underneath the vest and instead wraps his torso with bandages.
Some of the shirts that males wear in Liyue are based off the tangzhuang, as seen in the decorations on the front of the shirt.

===Women's Fashion===

Girls in Liyue tend to wear short, knee length dresses that have a resemblance to the Chinese qipao. Women who lived in Liyue Harbor tend to wear long dresses with similar details to the qipao. Madame Ping's clothes seemed to be inspired by the hanfu, an ancient style of clothing. This could be a reference to Madame Ping's age.

There are currently no NPCs wearing exorcist or thaumaturge attire.

==Festivals and Holidays==
===Lantern Rite Festival===
{{main|Lantern Rite Festival}}

===Moonchase Festival===
{{main|Moonchase Festival}}

===Rite of Descension===
The {{Lang|Rite of Descension|zh=七星请仙典仪|zh_rm=Qīxīng Qǐng Xiān Diǎn Yí|zh_tl=Qixing's Adeptus Invitation Ceremony}} is an annual event that occurs in Liyue Harbor. The [[Liyue Qixing]] invite the Geo Archon, Morax, to the mortal realm to give his divine predictions for the upcoming year, which the Qixing use to determine Liyue's policies and business trends.
It is unknown how many predictions are typically made per year, but the year before the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] visited Liyue, Morax gave 17 predictions.<ref name="C1A1P1">{{Ref/Quest|Rite of Descension}}</ref>

Unlike Rite of Partings, which are used to commemorate deceased [[adepti]], the Rite of Descension appears to be open to all people and is a popular tourist attraction. Liyue people who live abroad will also often make a pilgrimage home to witness the Rite of Descension.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Musheng}}</ref> However, life in Liyue Harbor largely continues as normal otherwise, and most of the city's residents don't attend the event.<ref name="C1A1P1" />

==Languages==
Several different languages are used simultaneously in Liyue. Alongside the [[Languages#Teyvat Language|common language]], a [[Liyue Language|local language]] that resembles Chinese {{w|seal script}} can be found throughout Liyue, such as signs and even certain character skill animations. On a few occasions, in-game books have explained the significance of names derived from the "local language."

===Idioms===
Liyue is known for its idioms and sayings, a few of which have been brought up throughout the game. Because idioms tend to depend on cultural context, they are sometimes altered for the English localization to fit the spirit of the saying.

==Politics==
Liyue is governed by the [[Liyue Qixing]], a group of seven powerful businesspeople who interpret and dictate the rules set forth by Rex Lapis. Each of one of these seven members works in their own division to strengthen the country; the Tianquan, [[Ningguang]], focuses on the law, while the Yuheng, [[Keqing]] focuses on land development, employment, construction and real estate.

===Military===
The Qixing's military force is the [[Millelith]], who also serve as peacekeepers. They are mostly seen protecting areas of interest, along with small outposts set up on some roads to protect people from monsters and criminals. Their weapon of choice are polearms.

Liyue is also protected by various [[adepti]] who signed a contract with Morax to defend the nation from malevolent forces. In the present day, there are seven known adepti who continue to do so; [[Xiao]], [[Ganyu]], [[Madame Ping]], [[Yanfei]]'s father, [[Cloud Retainer]], [[Moon Carver]] and [[Mountain Shaper]]. Xiao plays a more active role in eliminating demons as the only remaining [[yaksha]]. Ganyu and Ping reside in Liyue Harbor, the former assisting the Liyue Qixing while the latter spends her time in Yujing Terrace. Yanfei's father had left prior to the current events of the game on a journey with his wife. The latter three mostly remain in their abodes in [[Jueyun Karst]]. Following the events after Morax stepped down as Geo Archon, the adepti have allowed humans to govern for themselves but will intervene to defend the nation if they are incapable of doing so.

==Travel Highlights==
The [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/town/liyue?mute=1&noteId=2015 Teyvat Travel Highlights] are published by the [[Adventurers' Guild]] on the ''Genshin Impact'' official website.

===A Merchant's Memory of Liyue===
When I received the invitation from the Merchant and Adventurers' Guilds of Liyue to write a piece on Liyue Harbor, I hesitated for a long time before finally embracing the challenge. Sure, I have been running a caravan around Teyvat with my father for as long as I can remember. Those born and raised in Liyue aside, there is no one in Teyvat who knows every route in and out of Liyue as well as I. With that said, I've met my share of exceptional poets and writers on the road, and I would never consider myself a writer of their caliber. Therefore, I'm afraid I must apologize in advance for my lack of literary ability to write a real page-turner. So, please bear with me.

Even when I was young, Liyue Harbor, the greatest trading port in all of Teyvat, already meant wealth and prosperity to everyone in our caravan. I remember, back then, every time when the children heard the caravan was going to Liyue, they'd beg for a place in the caravan. Though it was a long time ago, the memory of the bustling streets, noisy crowds, and the wonders lying on the shop shelves are all still so vivid to me. I can still remember the mysterious and enticing scents calling out to me from the snack stalls.

When I came of age, I was entrusted with the family business. I then led the caravan between all the major cities across Teyvat. As the world opened up to me, Liyue also became a lot more to me than just the port I used to run around barefoot in as a kid.

From my understanding of Liyue Harbor's history, I can dare to make a bold conclusion on just how Liyue came to be so rich. Just as any other prosperous city in Teyvat, Liyue's prosperity came from its geographic advantages. Liyue is a harbor city surrounded by mountains on three sides. Beyond the mountains inland, there are vast foothills, plains, fords, and abundant mines full of precious ores. These ores are harvested and made into exquisite crafts at the hands of skilled craftsmen. The founding of the harbor and the establishment of the sea routes were instrumental in popularizing Liyue's commercial trade, as it was the export of crafts that laid the initial foundation for Liyue's financial development. Even now, Liyue's exquisite crafts are still prized by people across the continent.

After all these years, the sea routes leading into Liyue are now very well established. Trade vessel is the ideal travel method for anyone wanting to conduct business in Liyue. However, for common travelers and tourists, the land routes are recommended for a richer sightseeing experience as opposed to being on the great blue for prolonged periods of time.

Due to the complex terrain surrounding Liyue, the most common route there by land starts out from Mondstadt's Dawn Winery, then heads southwest. The route takes travelers through Mondstadt's signature landscapes. Enjoy some locally-grown fruit from Mondstadt on the way, and when the open plains are replaced by mountains and lakes, you'll be nearing Mondstadt's border.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - A Merchant's Memory 1.png|300px]]

Follow the edge of the lake west, and you will see two towering cliffs, serving as a natural boundary that separates Liyue and Mondstadt, with a narrow passage in between them paved with wooden planks. On the rare occasions that I pass through this way, I'm usually focused on getting through as quickly as possible. Though on one occasion I found myself traveling alongside an elderly fisherman. Along the way he covered a wide range of topics, from the identification of different species of river fish, to the ancient legends of Liyue. He said, the lakes in the gorge were blessed water bodies set by Rex Lapis and therefore stopping there may bring you closer to the Archons.

I used to laugh superstitious beliefs off, but my vivacious romanticist of a wife believed what he said. Ever since then, my caravan would rest here for a bit before continuing on, in the hopes of receiving blessings from the gods.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - A Merchant's Memory of Liyue 2.png|300px]]

After passing through Stone Gate, the view opens up, revealing the classic outskirt views of Liyue: bodies of water reflecting the skies, and patches of green plants jut out from between shoals and fords. Far in the distance in Dihua Marsh is Wangshu Inn, which sits on top of a giant stone pillar, serving as a landmark for caravans passing through the region. Some foreign traders conduct their business with the local merchants right there, while others rest a bit and gather some trade info before continuing on to Liyue Harbor.

It would probably take a whole book for me to write down every little thing about my past experiences with Liyue from my youth to this day, so I'll stop right here. I don't really know how to conclude things, so I guess I'll just say this: I hope I am remembered by some that I've met out on the road.

'''P.S.''' Many thanks to the Merchant and Adventurers' Guilds for giving me a chance to relive my beautiful memories of Liyue. I'd also like to thank my wife, Claire, for her help in infusing some much-needed vitality into my otherwise dull and poor writing.
