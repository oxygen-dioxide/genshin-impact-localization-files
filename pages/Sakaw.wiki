{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sakaw:''' The fog on the sea has thickened lately. A worrying sign...
:'''Sakaw:''' Could that legend be true?
:{{DIcon}} What legend?
:'''Sakaw:''' Err... Ah, that depends on what legend you wish to hear, outlander hero...
:'''Sakaw:''' Two reasons have been given for that floating island and the huge graffiti: One more akin to a story, and the other to a real legend.
:'''Sakaw:''' Which would you like to hear, outlander warrior?
:{{DIcon}} Let's hear the story...
::'''Sakaw:''' Hmm, there's always a romantic spin with stories... There, the origin of the graffiti on the foggy floating island is part of [[The Tale of Qoyllor and Ukuku]].
::'''Sakaw:''' It is said that the girl named [[Qoyllor]] left a huge work of graffiti by the beach in order to contact her Father Sun.
::'''Sakaw:''' Her Father Sun saw the graffiti from the sky and thus whisked her away from the earth... That's sort of how the story goes.
::'''Sakaw:''' It is said that the unsettling mist was bestowed by the Sun Father upon the people of the surface, as punishment for stealing his daughter's power.
:{{DIcon}} About the real legend...
::'''Sakaw:''' As for the real legend... It is said that a long time ago, there was an [[Mimic Wayob Manifestation|evil sorcerer]] who disguised himself as a [[Wayob]] and bewitched the heroes of the tribe.
::'''Sakaw:''' Later, the tribal heroes had to seal the pitch-black wicked wizard within that giant graffiti...
::'''Sakaw:''' As to why the ocean surface has become like this... They say that it presages the moment when the evil wizard shall shatter the seal and escape its grasp.
:'''Sakaw:''' *sigh* Be it legend or story, the rising fog is never a good sign.
:'''Sakaw:''' Outlander hero... That place is probably fraught with danger, so you must take care not to get too close...

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available immediately after completing [[The Mystery of Tecoloapan Beach]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sakaw:''' Oh, have you come to take pictures? Foreign tourists have come here before, wishing to do the same. That floating island is quite the view, after all...
:'''Sakaw:''' It's just a shame we didn't have [[Kamera]] previously - I had to ask a foreign merchant I knew to get me one.
:'''Sakaw:''' How about it, dear guest? Care for a picture? But you'll have to do it yourself. I'm not exactly a dab hand at photography...
:{{DIcon}} Strange, there's fog over the sea...
:'''Sakaw:''' Fog? What do you mean? There can't be fog with such a strong sea breeze...
:'''Sakaw:''' I have never seen fog over the sea since the day I was born.
:'''Sakaw:''' Might you have confused this place with the fog-shrouded area that Tezcatepetonco Range overlooks, by any chance?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps...
:'''Sakaw:''' Hehe, if you ask me, I'd say you're just too nervous.
:'''Sakaw:''' You should loosen up — you're touring Natlan, after all.
