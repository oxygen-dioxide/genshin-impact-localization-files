{{Description|A vessel made with sweet black tea in mind rather than bitter liquor.}}
'''Maiden's Fleeting Leisure''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Maiden Beloved]].

==Description==
The maiden's most cherished teaware.<br />It was once filled with elegant black tea.

Indulging herself in pastries and tea,<br />She cared not one bit about the mundane world. This was her privilege as a maiden.

"This flower shall be my medal. That is all I need."<br />The knight said to her on the day they met.<br />"But my heart is already—"<br />Not finishing her confession was her privilege,<br />but also the chains of courtliness the maiden had to bear.
