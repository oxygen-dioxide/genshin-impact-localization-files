'''Companionship EXP''' is used to increase your current party's [[Friendship Level]].

All [[characters]] in the current party will each receive the full amount of Companionship EXP regardless if they are on the field or incapacitated. The [[Traveler]] is an exception as they cannot gain Companionship EXP.

The amount of Companionship EXP received by each character participating in [[Co-Op Mode]] is doubled. This bonus is not affected by how many players participate (i.e. Co-Op Mode with 3 players will not provide triple the Companionship EXP).

After acquiring the [[Realm Dispatch]], Companionship EXP can be obtained by hosting characters as companions in the [[Serenitea Pot]]. The max companions a realm can host is 8 at [[Trust Rank]] 9. EXP accumulates at a max rate of 5 per hour at 12,000 Adeptal Energy, with a maximum storage of 500 EXP at Trust Rank 10.
