'''Companionship EXP''' is used to increase the [[Friendship Level]] of [[Character]]s in the player's current [[Party]].

All characters in the current party will each receive the full amount of Companionship EXP regardless if they are on the field or incapacitated. The [[Traveler]] is an exception as they cannot gain Companionship EXP.

The amount of Companionship EXP received by each character participating in [[Co-Op Mode]] is doubled. This bonus is not affected by how many players participate (i.e., Co-Op Mode with 3 players will not provide triple the Companionship EXP). Being in Co-Op Mode alone does not trigger this bonus, 2 or more players must be in the world or have entered a domain together. After entering a domain with a Co-Op teammate, the bonus will stay unaffected when claiming rewards even if the teammate has left the domain.

After acquiring the [[Realm Dispatch]], Companionship EXP can be obtained by hosting characters as companions in the [[Serenitea Pot]]. The max companions a realm can host is 8 at [[Trust Rank]] 9. EXP accumulates at a max rate of 5 per hour at 12,000 [[Adeptal Energy]], with a maximum storage of 500 EXP at Trust Rank 10.
