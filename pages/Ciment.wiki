:'''[[Ciment]]:''' Proceed according to the plan?
:'''[[Gacic]]:''' The instructions were clear, and the message you received should be the same as mine.
:'''Ciment:''' What were the orders you received? Let's double-check.
:'''Gacic:''' I don't want trouble. We'll each follow the instructions, do the job, and then leave with the [[Mora]].
:'''Ciment:''' Is your superior out at sea, or landside?
:'''Gacic:''' ...
:'''Gacic:''' What did I just say? No chit-chat. I don't want to end up sleeping with the fishes.
:'''Ciment:''' Please. For all I know, your orders might be to slap some cement shoes on me and toss me in the harbor.
:'''Gacic:''' If you stop asking questions, you won't have anything to worry about.
