|description    = A delicate "Launch Tube" with an exquisite design. It is indeed one of the best gifts for the people of [[Liyue]]. The "Launch Tube" is filled with firework beads carefully pre-made by craftsmen, and can be set off with a simple operation.<br>Some Liyue people believe that "there is no need to wait for a feast or a festival, you can set off fireworks when you feel like it, you don't have to be restricted by certain rules." After all, watching fireworks is a means of relaxation. It is said that the [[Beidou|captain]] of [[the Crux Fleet]] would occasionally set off fireworks with a specific pattern when the fleet was at anchor to boost the morale of the crew. If necessary, this Launch Tube can also be used as a flare launcher.
