|description    = A settlement comprised of various floating platforms, hot air balloons, and training grounds that recreates the character and style of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]. It's said that nearly every member of the Flower-Feather Clan dreams of joining the flying squad and setting off on a crusade to conquer the sky. For those with such aspirations, each day is a training session. A certain warrior once said: "Only the effort you put in will never betray you," and these words inspire many to work hard and strive to achieve their dreams.
