'''Grand Narukami Shrine Omamori''' is a Quest Item obtained during the [[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter II]]: Act III - [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]] quest "[[Wishes (Quest)|Wishes]]".

==Trivia==
* When the omamori is first given by [[Yae Miko]] in [[Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage]], it has a quality of 1★ [[Grand Narukami Shrine Omamori (Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage)|Grand Narukami Shrine Omamori]]. The Traveler uses the omamori in [[The Omnipresent God]], and upon completion of [[Wishes (Quest)|Wishes]], the quality increases to 4★ and the description changes.
* The characters on the item are written in the [[Inazuma Language]]. The text is deciphered to read "OMR," short for "omamori."
* {{w|Omamori}} (御守 or お守り) are Japanese amulets commonly sold at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, dedicated to particular Shinto kami as well as Buddhist figures, and are said to provide various forms of luck or protection.<ref>{{w|Omamori|Wikipedia page for Omamori}}</ref>
