==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Qushji:''' I guess my neck is going to snap before I even solve this.
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Qushji:''' My neck... It hurts...
::'''Qushji:''' This is probably the ordeal all astrologers must go through. The weight of the starry sky seems to crash down on the neck when you stargaze.
::'''Qushji:''' Worse yet, the hydromantic instruments in the academy fell into disrepair due to budget constraint.
::'''Qushji:''' Researchers like us who aren't part of big projects must resort to more primitive measures...
::'''Qushji:''' If only the new [[Grand Conservator]] knew the value of astrology...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Take care.
:::'''Qushji:''' Thanks for your concern.
:::'''Qushji:''' The only consolation is that now that the Akademiya has started to work on a much more important project, they have lowered their expectations on our research productivity.
:::'''Qushji:''' I'll also have more time to take better care of myself now.
:::'''Qushji:''' Neck pain may be difficult to cure, but a healthy diet is said to be able to improve one's vision. Well, there are worse things to suffer through for a good cause...
::;(Obtain {{Item|Carrot|20|x=10}})
::{{DIcon}} The new Grand Conservator?
:::'''Qushji:''' Yes... A youngster like you should be better informed than me.
:::'''Qushji:''' Everyone in Sumeru City is paying close attention to the matter, be it an ordinary researcher like myself or a barber in the downtown area.
:::'''Qushji:''' If the new Grand Conservator is interested in astrology, he might apply for some funding and restart the use of those hydromantic instruments.
:::'''Qushji:''' I can also benefit from his influence and no longer have to stick out my old neck again.
:::'''Qushji:''' So that means... I'd prefer to have [[Rifaet]] be the next Grand Conservator.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Qushji:''' Farewell. I'll have a break.
