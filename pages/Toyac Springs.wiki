==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*''Atoyac'' means "on the river" in the Nahuatl language.
*Toyac Springs appears to be inspired by the {{w|Pantanal}} (the largest wetland in the world) due to its geographical similarities and importance to the planet. Furthermore, in the Portuguese version it is directly called “Pantanal” instead of “Springs” which may be an indication that it is the inspiration.
