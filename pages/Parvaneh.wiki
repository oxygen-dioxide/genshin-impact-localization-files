==Profile==
Parvaneh is a young woman from Sumeru and a member of the Gourmet Supremos. She is a student of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]] and is seen consulting its field guide when looking for ways to cook different dishes.

===Personality===
Parvaneh is a serious and slightly short tempered woman. She is a devout student of the Akademiya and trusts its field guide more than the other Gourmet Supremos when it comes to cooking processes. She shows a distrust of Julie's survival skills and calls her an idiot, saying she has no idea what she's doing when she goes after [[Kamei Munehisa]].

===Appearance===
Parvaneh is a tall woman with fair skin, short brown hair, and brown eyes. She wears a green & yellow dress with black sandals, an outfit commonly worn by female NPCs from Sumeru. Her sleeves have golden details on them, and she has yellow and gray fabric tied around her waist.
