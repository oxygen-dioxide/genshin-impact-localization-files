{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hirotatsu:''' What can I help you with? If you are here to seek an audience with [[Kamisato Ayato|the Commissioner]] or [[Kamisato Ayaka|Miss Kamisato]], please go talk to [[Madarame Hyakubei|Mr. Madarame]].
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Hirotatsu:''' My name is Hirotatsu, a member of the [[Yashiro Commission]]. I am in charge of the security of both Miss Kamisato and this mansion.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the Yashiro Commission.
::'''Hirotatsu:''' Oh? Do you have business with the Commissioner?
::'''Hirotatsu:''' He is very busy. The various affairs at the Yashiro Commission have all but tied his hands, and he still has to deal with the other two Commissions...
::'''Hirotatsu:''' My master and I have been taken good care of by the Commissioner before, so I will try my best to help him out.
::'''Hirotatsu:''' Though all I can do now is be a good guard... Therefore, I will protect the mansion and Miss Kamisato with my life to repay the Commissioner!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hirotatsu:''' Yeah, you take care as well.
