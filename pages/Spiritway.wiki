'''Spiritways''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. 

They can be ridden on to move swiftly in the flow's direction using the [[Koholasaurus]] and [[People of the Springs]] ability, or with [[Mavuika]]'s Flamestrider. Playable characters must be in the [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state to board a spiritway, and riding one will not consume Nightsoul points, [[Phlogiston]], or [[Stamina]].

Spiritways can be one-way or bidirectional, as indicated by the presence or lack of portal-shaped ends. 
Both types can be entered anywhere along their route, but for bidirectional spiritways, the direction of entry determines the direction of travel. The player can exit the spiritway at any point by exiting the Nightsoul's Blessing state or ejecting themselves from the [[Saurian Indwelling|indwelled]] Koholosaur.

Modern humans are able to use [[Phlogiston Engraving]] to create [[Tutorial/Spiritdoors|Spiritdoors]], which can stabilize or create new spiritways. Interact with one to activate the corresponding spiritway.

==Trivia==
* The appearance of a Spiritway changes when the active character is a People of the Springs character, Mavuika, or indwelling a Koholasaur &mdash; it becomes brighter and more vibrant.
