'''Fishing''' is a [[Game System]] available after unlocking the [[Serenitea Pot]] and completing the {{Quest|Exploding Population}}.

It involves crafting [[bait]] to catch different types of fish, with each type only being attracted to one specific bait.

When fishing, players need to cast their line into a body of [[water]]. The exact casting spot can be adjusted by the player, and should not be too close to the fish to not scare it away, but close enough to grab its attention. Once the fish bites, the player has to time their reaction and control the line's tension to reel in the fish.

The ripple effect indicating available fishing spots will disappear once all its available fish have been caught, and will return once at least one fish has respawned. New fish will '''[[Reset|respawn every 72 hours]]'''.

Even though adjusting ingame-time does not influence the respawn rate, it should be noted that each fishing spot has a different set of fish for night and day. This means that players can fish twice the amount if a fish can be caught during both day times.

Fish caught can be processed in [[Cooking]] to produce [[Fish]] as a cooking item, and can also be exchanged for rewards in [[Fishing Association]]s of various regions, where the player can notably exchange new fishing rods with different effects.

The [[Map]] includes a {{Icon|Fishing Pin|20}} Pin that can be used to mark [[Fishing Points]].

The catching difficulty is based on several parameters, including the rate of increase in progress, the size of the Ideal Tension Zone, and the movement of the Ideal Tension Zone. Other factors include how long it takes the fish to take the bait (higher difficulty = higher duration) and how long the player has to begin reeling in a fish that bit the bait (higher difficulty = shorter duration).

==Ornamental Fish==
{{See also|Furnishing Subsystem#Ornamental Fish}}
Ornamental fish can be found in fishing spots that emit a blue glow when seen from a distance and can be easily spotted among the cluster as its movements are erratic, jumping up and down in the fishing spot while the other fish calmly swim about. They are also much harder to catch. (Thoma's Talent [[Snap and Swing]], which gives a chance to double catch in Inazuma, also affects Ornamental Fish.) After being caught, Ornamental Fish can be displayed in [[Furnishing Subsystem#Ornamental Fish|certain furnishings]] or in the realm [[Sublime Spicewood]]. The blueprints for those furnishings are available from the Fishing Association.

About Ornamental fish Spawn:
* Ornamental fish can be found at any fishing point.
* Ornamental fish at fishing points can be of any type.
* Ornamental fish can appear in either the day or night time.
* Ornamental fish appear regardless of the weather.
* Multiple Ornamental fish may appear at the same time in a fishing point.
* Like all other fish, Ornamental fish in a fishing point refresh every three real world days.

==Notes==
* Fishing forcibly switches the character to the [[Traveler]]. As such, if they are currently knocked out, the player will be unable to fish until they are revived.
* Entering a fishing spot (by [[swimming]], using an [[Alternate Sprint]] or using the [[Waverider]]) will scare all the fish away, replacing the ripple effect with a bubble effect until the fish return a few seconds after the player and Waverider left the spot.
** Additionally, gliding over a fishing spot will scare all the fish away, regardless of vertical distance.
* If there is bait in the proximity of an Ornamental fish, while it is in the jumping animation, the animation does not affect the rate of the fish taking the bait.
** Meaning, you don't have to wait for the fish to finish its animation for it to approach and take your bait. The animation cancels when it takes your bait.
* Although Ornamental fish can appear in either day or night time, the blue glow indicator will only be present at during the time period where the fish can be caught.
** For example, a Fishing Spot containing an [[Ornamental Dawncatcher]] will only display the indicator during 18:00 – 6:00, based on in-game time.
* Fishing cannot be started while the character is standing on frozen water, a [[Geo Construct]], performing an idle animation, or in combat.
* All worlds have fish, even worlds whose host has not completed ''Exploding Population''. Other players who have unlocked Fishing can catch their fish if they join their world.
* Extra fish obtained from Thoma's Talent [[Snap and Swing]] do not count towards the Achievement [[Ding Ding Ding!]]
