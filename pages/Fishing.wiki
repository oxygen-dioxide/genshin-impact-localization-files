{{Description|Recently, the Teyvat ecology has seen an increase in fish population, with many new fish species appearing in various waters. The grassroots Fishing Association has its hands full and had to put up a commission for help at the Adventurers' Guild...
Bring your fishing rod, choose the bait, find the spot, cast your rod, reel it in, and voila, a big catch!<br />The fish caught can not only be used to make dishes, but also can be exchanged for precious treasures at the Fishing Association. There's even a chance to catch vibrant ornamental fish to admire at your home!<br />What are you waiting for? Let's become anglers together!}}
'''Fishing''' is a [[Game System]] available after unlocking the [[Serenitea Pot]] and completing the quest "[[Exploding Population]]".

It involves crafting [[bait]] to catch different types of fish, with each type only being attracted to one specific bait.

When fishing, players need to cast their line into a body of [[water]]. The exact casting spot can be adjusted by the player, and should not be too close to the fish to not scare it away, but close enough to grab its attention. Once the fish bites, the player has to time their reaction and control the line's tension to reel in the fish.

The ripple effect indicating available fishing spots will disappear once all its available fish have been caught, and will return once at least one fish has respawned. New fish will '''[[Reset|respawn every 72 hours]]'''.

Even though adjusting ingame-time does not influence the respawn rate, it should be noted that each fishing spot has a different set of fish for night and day. This means that players can fish twice the amount if a fish can be caught during both day times.

Fish caught can be processed in [[Cooking]] to produce [[Fish]] as a cooking item, and can also be exchanged for rewards in [[Fishing Association]]s of various regions, where the player can notably exchange new fishing rods with different effects.

The [[Map]] includes a {{Icon|Fishing Pin|20}} Pin that can be used to mark [[Fishing Points]].

The catching difficulty is based on several parameters, including the rate of increase in progress, the size of the Ideal Tension Zone, and the movement of the Ideal Tension Zone. Other factors include how long it takes the fish to take the bait (higher difficulty = higher duration) and how long the player has to begin reeling in a fish that bit the bait (higher difficulty = shorter duration).

==Ornamental Fish==
Ornamental fish can be found in fishing spots that emit a blue glow when seen from a distance and can be easily spotted among the cluster as its movements are erratic, jumping up and down in the fishing spot while the other fish calmly swim about. They are also much harder to catch. (Thoma's Talent [[Snap and Swing]], which gives a chance to double catch in Inazuma, also affects Ornamental Fish.) After being caught, Ornamental Fish can be displayed in [[Furnishing Subsystem#Ornamental Fish|certain furnishings]] or in the realm [[Sublime Spicewood]]. The blueprints for those furnishings are available from the Fishing Association.

About Ornamental fish Spawn:

==Notes==
*Fishing forcibly switches the character to the [[Traveler]]. As such, if they are currently knocked out, the player will be unable to fish until they are revived.
*Entering a fishing spot (by [[swimming]], using an [[Alternate Sprint]] or using the [[Waverider]]) will scare all the fish away, replacing the ripple effect with a bubble effect until the fish return a few seconds after the player and Waverider left the spot.
**Additionally, gliding over a fishing spot will scare all the fish away, regardless of vertical distance.
*If there is bait in the proximity of an Ornamental fish, while it is in the jumping animation, the animation does not affect the rate of the fish taking the bait.
**Meaning, you don't have to wait for the fish to finish its animation for it to approach and take your bait. The animation cancels when it takes your bait.
*Fishing cannot be started while the character is standing on frozen water, a [[Geo Construct]], performing an idle animation, or in combat.
*All worlds have fish, even worlds where the host has not completed "[[Exploding Population]]." Other players who have unlocked Fishing can catch their fish if they join their world.
