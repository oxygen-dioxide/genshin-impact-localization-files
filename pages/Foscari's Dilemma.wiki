{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After defeating the Sternshield Crabs)
:'''Foscari:''' Thank you, my benefactor! [[Remus|God King]] be praised, I'm saved!
:'''Foscari:''' Are you one of the legionnaires who defend this city? Or a valiant soul who happened by?
:'''Foscari:''' In any case, allow me to introduce myself. Faustus am I, one of the Mercatores Exquisiti appointed by the God King himself.
:'''Foscari:''' I came here to transport spices from the southern realms... I did not think that those vile [[vishap]]s would surround me the instant I came ashore...
:{{DIcon}} Vishaps? I didn't see any vishaps.
:'''Foscari:''' Hmm? My word, you truly are a mighty warrior &mdash; those foes were simply beneath your notice, I see!
:'''Foscari:''' In any case, do take these. Yet I fear I must be short on pleasantries &mdash; these goods still need transporting into the city. Perhaps we shall meet again there.
