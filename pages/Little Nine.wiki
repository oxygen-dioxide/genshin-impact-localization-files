'''Little Nine''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] who appears in the {{Quest|Book in the Woods}}.

==Profile==
Little Nine used to be [[Chang the Ninth]]'s neighbor in [[Qingce Village]]. Growing up, she would pester Chang the Ninth &mdash; whom she nicknamed Big Nine &mdash; to read her his stories.<ref name="FOTS">{{Ref/Quest|For Old Time's Sake}}</ref>  She was so immersed in the story that was written specifically for her that she lost track of him and eventually fell into the river, with the book tight in her arms.<ref name="BitW">{{Ref/Quest|Book in the Woods}}</ref>

The river was so cold that it froze her hands stiff. After climbing out of the river bank, she put the book somewhere to dry and "fell asleep."<ref name="BitW" /> She awoke to the book missing, implying that she died from hypothermia. Chang the Ninth also claims she abruptly disappeared,<ref name="FOTS" /> and while Chang the Ninth has grown into an adult, Little Nine still retains her youthful appearance.

In ''Book in the Woods'', she asks the [[Traveler]] to help her find the book. Once the Traveler and [[Paimon]] return, she is nowhere to be found.

===Appearance===
Little Nine is a little girl with a singular black braid and black eyes. Her hair is parted to her right side of her face, and on the left she wears a pink flower. She wears a qipao with varying shades of teal, white, and minimal gold. Her shoes are pumps that match the dark turquoise linings of her qipao.
