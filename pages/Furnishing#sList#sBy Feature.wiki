==Floatable Furnishings==
These furnishings, or a component of the furnishings, have the ability to be freely floated. The "Switch" button in the placement menu allows the player to switch between which direction (vertical or horizontal) to move the item. The height of the furnishing will be shown during placement, and the maximum height is 30 units.

==Surface Furnishings==
These furnishings can have other furnishings placed on their surface. The height of the furnishing's surface is used when the "Snap Height" option in the placement menu is enabled. Furnishings with a surface cannot be placed if their surface is at an elevation above 30 units.

If an item is placed on the furnishing, then the surface furnishing is required when placing a [[Replica]].

Note that a large number of [[Interior Furnishing|interior furnishing]]s share this property, even those which do not resemble tables.
