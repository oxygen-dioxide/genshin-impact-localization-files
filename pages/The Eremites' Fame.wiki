|description    = The [[Eremites]]' flag flies proudly. It is woven from thick, red satin, and the golden-stitched crest is made with great care and precision. It is said that scattered Eremite mercenaries won't give up their will to fight as long as they can still see this flag. In fact, even snapping the flag wouldn't cause the mercenaries to give up their fight... The warriors will only flee in such a situation if they have encountered an extremely powerful enemy.
