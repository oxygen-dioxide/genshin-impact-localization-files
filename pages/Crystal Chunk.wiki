'''Crystal Chunks''' are turquoise crystals used in [[Forging]] and [[Alchemy]]. They are used primarily for forging [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]] and certain [[Weapons]].

==How to Obtain==
Crystal Ore are generally found inside caves or mines and near mountainous terrain. See the gallery or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=16 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

They can be harvested by attacking their destructible nodes, dropping 1–3 Crystal Chunks. Crystal Ore can be broken more quickly, like all [[Geo Constructs]], by using [[Blunt Attack]]s and {{Geo}} abilities. Their respawn rate is 72 hours. However, certain locations with [[Mining Outcrop]]s will spawn additional Crystal Ores alongside [[Magical Crystal Ore]]. To note, Mining Outcrops respawn daily, and respawn independently from the regular Crystal Ore.

In [[Co-Op Mode]], each nearby player will get their own drops with amounts randomized separately and players will not be able to see others' drops. Unlike most [[Materials]], they cannot be affected by {{Anemo}} abilities that may move them.

They can also be awarded upon completion of some [[Expedition]]s.
