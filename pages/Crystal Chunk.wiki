{{Description|An uncut crystal. Only professional craftsmanship can bring out its true value. This kind of limpid rock is a precious gift of the land, which can be utilized as a valuable weapon-making material.}}
'''Crystal Chunks''' are turquoise crystals used in [[Forging]] and [[Alchemy]]. They are used primarily for forging [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]] and certain [[Weapons]].

==How to Obtain==
Crystal Ore are generally found inside caves or mines and near mountainous terrain.

They can be harvested by attacking their destructible nodes, dropping 1–3 Crystal Chunks. Crystal Ore can be broken more quickly, like all [[Geo Constructs]], by using [[Blunt Attack]]s and {{Geo}} abilities. Their respawn rate is 72 hours. However, certain locations with [[Mining Outcrop]]s will spawn additional Crystal Ores alongside [[Magical Crystal Ore]]. To note, Mining Outcrops respawn daily, and respawn independently from the regular Crystal Ore.

In [[Co-Op Mode]], each nearby player will get their own drops with amounts randomized separately and players will not be able to see others' drops. Unlike most [[Materials]], they cannot be affected by {{Anemo}} abilities that may move them.

They can also be awarded upon completion of some [[Expedition]]s.

==Notes==
* Claiming Crystal Chunks from expeditions also grants [[Battle Pass]] Experience for "Mine 10 Items" under Daily Missions, similar to obtaining other ores from expeditions.
* Mining certain Crystal Chunks in [[The Chasm]] will restore [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]] energy.
