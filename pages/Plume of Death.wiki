'''Plume of Death''', most commonly referred to as "'''the Feather'''", or simply "'''the Plume'''", is an [[Artifact]] Piece in [[Genshin Impact]]. It increases a [[character]]'s ATK stat by adding flat +ATK and is one of the two Artifact Pieces to have a set main stat (along with the [[Flower of Life]]). Artifact Pieces can appear in all rarities (1-5 stars).

It is considered to be one of the easiest pieces to get "good stats" on because of its set main stat: the variance is therefore strict to the substats. Note that Artifacts cannot share the same main stat as substats, so Plumes of Death cannot have the flat +ATK substat. It is possible, however, to have +ATK% on a Feather, since it is considered a different type of substat.
