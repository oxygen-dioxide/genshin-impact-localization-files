The {{Lang|'''Guhua Clan'''|zh=古华派|zh_rm=Gǔhuá-pài|zh_tl=Sect of Ancient Splendor}}, formerly known as the '''Guhua Brotherhood''', is a martial arts school that has seen heavy decline in the past few centuries.

Established after the fighting style of the [[adeptus]] [[Guhua]] by one of his close associates,<ref name="RS">{{Ref/Weapon|Rainslasher}}</ref> their fighting style revolves around the use of swords or polearms, though Guhua himself used a [[Rainslasher|claymore]].

==Overview==
In its heyday, the Guhua Brotherhood was well known for performing chivalrous deeds throughout [[Liyue]], having hundreds of followers. However, over time, the group dwindled and underwent several name changes until it had a paltry handful of practitioners.

The Guhua Clan's three secret arts are "Light Piercer" for polearms, "Rain Cutter" for swords, and "Life Ender" for those who mastered both weapons.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xingqiu|Vision}}</ref>
