{{Quote|The noblest martial virtue is to pursue that which benefits other people.|The beliefs of the Guhua Clan<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chen the Sharp}}</ref>}}
The {{Lang|'''Guhua Clan'''|zh=古华派|zh_rm=Gǔhuá-pài|zh_tl=Sect of Ancient Splendor}}, formerly known as the '''Guhua Brotherhood''', is a martial arts school that has seen heavy decline in the past few centuries.

Established after the fighting style of the [[adeptus]] [[Guhua]] by one of his close associates,<ref name="RS">{{Ref/Weapon|Rainslasher}}</ref> their fighting style revolves around the use of swords or polearms, though Guhua himself used a [[Rainslasher|claymore]].

==Overview==
In its heyday, the Guhua Brotherhood was well known for performing chivalrous deeds throughout [[Liyue]], having hundreds of followers. However, over time, the group dwindled and underwent several name changes until it had a paltry handful of practitioners, most of whom try to maintain their primary training center, [[Wangshan Hall]], or try to restore the clan's name.

The Guhua Clan's three secret arts are "Light Piercer" for polearms, "Rain Cutter" for swords, and "Life Ender" for those who mastered both weapons.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xingqiu|Vision}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* After completing [[Shrouded Vale, Hidden Hero]], a [[Stonehide Lawachurl]] can be found in the Guhua training location and defeated three times to obtain the {{Achievement|"Wanna Learn? I'll Teach You!"}} The Lawachurl's titles call it an uninitiated Guhua disciple, while the achievement's description calls it "a special unofficial Guhua Clan disciple."
