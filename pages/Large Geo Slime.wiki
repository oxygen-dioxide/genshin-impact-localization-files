|name_3 = Jumping Slam
|desc_3 = <ul><!--
--><li>While the Geo Shield is intact, jumps high into the air before marking the impact area and slamming down at the player's location, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.</li><!--
--><li>If attacked while the Geo Shield is destroyed, performs a low jump with extremely limited range, dealing '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} upon landing.</li><!--
--><li>Certain enhanced Large Geo Slimes, found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges, have reduced [[Cooldown]] on this attack.</li><!--

==Strategy==
Their [[Shields|shield]] is weakest against [[Blunt Attack]]s such as {{Color|Geo}} attacks, [[Claymore]] attacks, [[Plunging Attack]]s, and [[explosion]]s such as the [[Overloaded]] Elemental Reaction.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Monsters created through the buildup of Geo within the earth.<br>They can harden the energy within their bodies into a carapace of stone that protects them and prevents damage. The legend of a "Golden Geo Slime King" once circulated among the Treasure Hoarders. They believed that since gemstones and ores have Geo energy in them, Geo Slimes, which also contain Geo energy, may also be a type of gemstone or ore.|[[Archive]]}}
