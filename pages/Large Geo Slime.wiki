{{Description|Monsters created through the buildup of Geo within the earth.<br />They can harden the energy within their bodies into a carapace of stone that protects them and prevents damage. The legend of a "Golden Geo Slime King" once circulated among the Treasure Hoarders. They believed that since gemstones and ores have Geo energy in them, Geo Slimes, which also contain Geo energy, may also be a type of gemstone or ore.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Geo Shield:''' The Geo Slime can generate a Geo [[Shields|shield]] to protect them from all incoming DMG. The shield takes [[Poise Damage]], and can withstand 600 Poise Damage from [[Blunt Attack]]s or 4000 Poise Damage from non-Blunt Attacks.
*'''Rock Spit:''' Spews a rock at the player which has a moderate range, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.
*'''Leap:'''
**While the Geo Shield is intact, jumps high into the air before marking the impact area and slamming down at the player's location, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.
**If attacked while the Geo Shield is destroyed, performs a low jump with extremely limited range, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}} upon landing.
** Certain enhanced Large Geo Slimes, found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges, have reduced [[Cooldown]] on this attack.
*'''Regeneration:''' If the '''Geo Shield''' is destroyed, retreats from the player. The shield will regenerate after a period of time.

==Strategy==
Their [[Shields|shield]] is weakest against [[Blunt Attack]]s such as {{Color|Geo}} attacks, [[Claymore]] attacks, [[Plunging Attack]]s, and [[explosion]]s such as the [[Overloaded]] Elemental Reaction.
