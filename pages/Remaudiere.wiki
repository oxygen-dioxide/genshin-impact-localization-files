:'''Keratry:''' C'mon, brother, be my magic assistant!
:'''Remaudiere:''' Hah, do you think it'll be that easy? I am so very mighty in magic &mdash; how could I be your assistant?
:'''Keratry:''' Oh, I know, I know! I'll pay you a general salary! How does that sound?
:'''Remaudiere:''' Don't you mean a "generous" salary? Also, who taught you those ideas about utility?
:'''Keratry:''' Just tell me if you agree or not, c'mon...
:'''Remaudiere:''' Well... That's a difficult question. See, I'm currently twice your age.
:'''Remaudiere:''' By the time you become an adult, I'll already be in my middle age and have started to lose hair &mdash; I shan't be able to be your partner then.
:'''Keratry:''' Can't I use magic to make you not grow up?
:'''Remaudiere:''' Dear sister, we're speaking of magic tricks, not magic...
