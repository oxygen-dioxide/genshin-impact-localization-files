'''Hunting Trap''' is a limited [[consumable]] obtained from the quest {{Quest|Wolves' Territory}}.

==Usage==
Place the hunting trap on the ground by using it in the inventory, and then frighten a boar in such a way that it runs over the trap. You will earn 4–5 [[Raw Meat]] by killing the boar this way, double the usual amount.

==Notes==
* It is not necessary to utilize this item to complete the quest [[Wolves' Territory]].
* Multiple boars may be killed with one hunting trap if done in quick succession. The player still acquires two Raw Meat for each boar killed.
* The hunting trap is not a craftable item, so it is only possible to obtain two traps.
