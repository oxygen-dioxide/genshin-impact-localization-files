{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Khayyam, optional)
:'''Khayyam:''' (What's that song again... "The pomegranate... the apples...")

;(Approach Khayyam)
:'''Khayyam:''' "The pomegranate sings, the apples clap..."
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, Mr. Khayyam! What are you doing here?
:'''Khayyam:''' Oh, hello, hello. Child in white, and... *sigh* Apologies, my children. My memories are getting blurry, and names just fade after a while.
:{{DIcon}} Just call me {{Traveler}}.
:'''Khayyam:''' Haha... Okay, so you were the...
:'''Paimon:''' Yes! We were the Javans &mdash; the brave young ones!
:'''Khayyam:''' Hmm... So, please tell me, do the Aranara still remember me? Do they remember us all?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, uh...
:{{DIcon}} They remember.
::'''Paimon:''' ...
::'''Khayyam:''' I see... But I can't see them anymore, nor can I know how much they miss me... What a pity.
:{{DIcon}} They forgot.
::'''Paimon:''' But... We can befriend them all over again!
:'''Khayyam:''' Hehe... I can't see them anymore. I am too old to see their faces or hear their voices... Gone, it's all gone.
:'''Khayyam:''' *cough*... Apologies, I have to take my leave now. Perhaps a miracle is my only hope...
:'''Khayyam:''' One cannot understand or chase after a miracle. The only thing one can do is wait.
:{{Black Screen|Khayyam unsteadily walks away...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Look! The three of them are here!

;(Talk to Aranara)
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranaga, {{MC|he|she}} is here, they're here!
:'''Aragaru:''' Yeah, here, they're here!
:'''Aranaga:''' Here you are, Nara {{Traveler}}, White Floaty. Welcome you, the three of us.
:'''Aranaga:''' Here comes the moon. Now, is the time to plant flowers. Are you ready?
:{{DIcon}} I am ready.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon too!
:'''Aranaga:''' So... Aranakin, Aragaru, let's start the ritual.
:'''Aranaga:''' "Be back home, be back home, dreams of the garden, memories of the forest..."
:'''Aranaga:''' "Embrace, let us:"
:'''Aranaga:''' "Deeper dreams, everlasting happiness."
:'''Aranaga:''' "Rejoice, let us:"
:'''Aranaga:''' "The pomegranate sings, the apples clap!"
:{{Black Screen|The Aranara plant the dried flowers. With the ballad echoing in the wind, the flowers come back to life magically...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... The three flowers are alive again!
:'''Aranaga:''' Yes, because benevolent, Mawtiyima is. So, she gives memories a chance to resurrect.
:'''Aranakin:''' Yeah! Even if we forget about you, the memories will... Hmm, be woven into the leaf veins and roots, turn into leaves, turn into tree rings!
:'''Aragaru:''' Or turn into fatty worms, eaten by other worms. Other worms make things that nourish the plants, and make us grow!
:'''Paimon:''' But... You still can't recall anything about us, right?
:'''Aranaga:''' Yes... Because, memories don't belong to you and me... The stories from the past, we have shared with all grass and trees in the forest...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:'''Aranakin:''' But, it doesn't matter. Because we are new friends now, right?
:'''Aragaru:''' Yeah! New friends!

;(Talk to Aragaru)
:'''Aragaru:''' Thank you, Nara {{Traveler}} and White Floaty!
:'''Aragaru:''' We must hang out like this in the future, too!

;(Talk to Aranaga)
:'''Aranaga:''' Hi, Golden Nara and White Floaty.
:'''Aranaga:''' Thank you. I can't remember the past, but trusty friends, you surely are.

;(Talk to Aranakin)
:'''Aranakin:''' Hello, new friends!
:'''Aranakin:''' Hope you'll always remember our song!

;(Observe flowers)
:'''Reborn Flower:''' (The dried flowers came back to life, as if the old times have come back again...)
