|description    = The individual constituents of this rock cluster seem to be distributed in an orderly manner &mdash; almost as if they were soldiers standing in formation. Hence, it has been given the name "Formation Rock." First discovered near a [[Millelith]] camp, over time it has come to stand for the awesome will of the Millelith, faced with which "even rocks are compelled to fall in line."
