{{Lang|'''Kagami Gozen'''|ja=鏡御前}} was a [[Tenryou Commission]] official in [[Tatarasuna]] and the leader of [[Mikage Furnace]] workers. She met with [[Alice]] before the outbreak of [[Vision Hunt Decree]] civil war and was subsequently described by her in ''[[Teyvat Travel Guide]]''. Her current status (following the war and [[Archon Quest]] consequences) is unknown.

==Profile==
According to Alice, Kagami "seems to be a leader amongst the workers there, and has an official Shogunate post." During that time, the workers of Tatarasuna "trust and love" her, and hold her and her commands in as high regards as [[Kujou Takayuki|Tenryou Commissioner]] and [[Raiden Shogun]].<ref name="TTG">[[Teyvat Travel Guide#Vol. 3|Teyvat Travel Guide, Vol. 3]]</ref>

Kagami "frowns often" and is "very unfriendly-looking," for unknown reasons. Her body "has scars from high-temperature burns from Tatarigami."<ref name="TTG"/>

It is unknown what happened to her after Alice's travel, but it is known that after the ceasefire between the Shogunate and resistance, the Shogunate temporarily halted all production in Tatarasuna,<ref>{{Ref/BB|Inazuma Commercial Street Bulletin Board|Shogunate Announcement - Jade Steel}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Hanamizaka Bulletin Board|Amenoma Smithy Notice II}}</ref> and that Tenryou Commission underwent several big changes,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Lonesome Euthymia}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Truth Is Also a Lie}}</ref> both possibly rendering Kagami out of work.
