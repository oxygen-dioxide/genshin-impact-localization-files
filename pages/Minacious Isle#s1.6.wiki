'''Minacious Isle''' in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]] during [[Version 1.6]] and the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event.

==Part 1==
Nearby the island with the Teleport Waypoint, there is a locked chest by a [[Pyro Monument]] and a [[Cryo Monument]]. To light, use Pyro and Cryo skills respectively. It suffices to use [[Amber]]'s [[Baron Bunny]] and [[Kaeya]]'s [[Frostgnaw|Elemental Skill]] to light them up to unlock the chest.

==Part 2==
===Main Island===
There are three [[Hymnal Rings]] challenges on the island. The first involves rotating two rings so that the Harpastum hits its target, located near the teleport waypoint. A second challenge is located directly south of the teleport waypoint, where a Harpastum needs to drop directly onto the target below near the base of the cliff. East of the Inverted Ruins area, the last Hymnal Rings challenge involves a reprise ring.

There is a [[Windmill Mechanism]] at the bottom of the Inverted Ruins area. Activating and riding it will bring the player to a [[Chest]] that rewards [[Primogems]].

At the top of the southwest part of the island there will be a [[Seelie]]. Following it will start the quest [[The Winding Homeward Way]], which involves lighting [[Elemental Monument]]s to activate a portal back to [[Mondstadt]], where one can obtain a chest.

Next to one of the Hymnal Rings challenges, there is a time challenge on top of a fallen pillar. To the far east on top of the small isle is the second time challenge.

There will also be a mural that the player can take a [[Photo Mode|photo]] of to obtain the [[Minacious Isle Mural]].

After completing [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait]], The Echoing Conch (An Archon's Deeds) can be collected at the northwest part of the main island. [[Albedo]] could also be found near the [[Teleport Waypoint]] at the top until the end of [[Midsummer Island Adventure]].

===Northwest Island===
[[File:Screenshot Broken Isle South Island Bubble.webp|right|200px|thumb|North West Island is wrapped in an energy shield (with the reflection of the island visible).]]
Most of the island will be covered by a giant energy shield. There will be 1 [[Teleport Waypoint]] and 1 [[Waverider Waypoint]] on this island.

After completing [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait]], [[Kaeya]], [[Jean]], and [[Klee]] could be found and spoken to on this island until the end of [[Midsummer Island Adventure]].

After completing the quest [[The Final Riddle: A Secret Uncovered]], the energy shield is gone. A special [[Crafting Bench]] also becomes available for players to craft [[Harpastum Bombs Loaded... Blow 'Em Away!|Harpastum Bombs]].

===Stray West Island===
[[File:Story Echoing Tales Fog and Exit.png|120px|right|alt=Map location of the west island]]
Located in the far west of the map (further west of the island with the energy shield) is a small island with a cave. Use the Harpastum to break the painted wall and then break a [[Rock Pile]] to access 1 Echoing Conch (Fog and Exit).

==Underwater Ruins==
Directly west of the main Minacious Isle, there is a small island next to a [[whirlpool]] surrounded by small bubbles. Approaching the whirlpool will transport you into a cave.

===Walkthrough===
# Observe the stone tablet
# Climb up the vines
# Activate the [[Pressure Plate]]
# Enter the room
# Destroy the [[Rock Pile]]
# Activate the pressure plate at the designated time (01:00 AM – 02:00 AM)
# Leave the ruins
#* There is a [[Luxurious Chest]] in the corner of the room
#* There is also a [[Ruins Torch]] required for the puzzle on the island which unlocks the [[Exquisite Chest]]

===Dialogue===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Enter the whirlpool nearby)
:'''Paimon:''' So, that whirlpool leads here. But it was a one-way trip...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's see if there's another way out.
----
;(Observe the first stone tablet)
:'''Eroded Stone Tablet:''' "...this observation point is perfect for conducting astronomical research..."
:'''Paimon:''' Astronomical observation, huh? It looked like just a regular cavern...
:'''Paimon:''' There's so much water around here. What is this place?
----
;(Observe the second stone tablet)
:'''Eroded Stone Tablet:''' "...the margin of error in my observations here is too large, it seems I must find another observation point..."
----
;(Enter the gated room)
:'''Paimon:''' What now...

;(Break the Large [[Rock Pile]])
:'''Paimon:''' Yikes! The ground's shaking, and the water's rising!

;(Observe the third stone tablet)
:'''Eroded Stone Tablet:''' "...perhaps around 01:00 AM would be the optimal window of time..."

;(Activate the pressure plate at the appropriate time)
:'''Paimon:''' That window opened! But we still need to find a way outta here.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Wait, that's it! If the water keeps rising, it'll take us up there!
----
;(Upon leaving the gated room)
:'''Paimon:''' We made it out... But the room in that cave is probably filled with water now.
:'''Paimon:''' Why would there be a place like that underwater? So strange.
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, we should probably think about all this after getting back to shore...

==Quests==
{{Quests by Category List|Minacious Isle Quests&World Quests&Released in Version 1.6|not=}}

==Notable Features==
* [[Anemograna]]

==Trivia==
* The island consists of architecture that has since been turned upside down. Deep within the caverns also mentions that this spot was perfect for astronomical research. This suggests that the building was originally at a very high point. Coupled with the facts that dandelions native only to Mondstadt exist here, a [[Seelie]] returning to its spot just north of the Falcon Coast, and [[Traveler/Voice-Overs|dialogue from earlier observations]] suggests that Minacious Isle was originally part of Mondstadt.
