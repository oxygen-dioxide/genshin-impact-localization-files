==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Alrani is a scholar at the [[Sumeru Akademiya]] who is attempting to write her term paper. As of the World Quest ''[[In Another Land]]'', she is currently on her third rewrite. She first wanted to write about [[Mondstadt]], especially the [[Four Winds]], but then learned that [[Dvalin]] had attacked Mondstadt. She then decided to go to [[Liyue]], and, after being rescued from some [[Treasure Hoarders]] in ''[[And This Treasure Goes To...]]'' by the [[Traveler]], decided to write her paper on the Traveler's ability to control the [[Elements]] without a [[Vision]] in [[Endless Research]]. After having that paper rejected by her tutor, she leaves for Inazuma to write her paper on life in Inazuma. She encounters the Traveler again in [[Ritou]], where she enlists their help to take photos around Ritou and ends up helping [[Vahid]] market the fertilisiers sold at [[Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe]] in exchange for Vahid's help during the quest ''In Another Land''.

She soon went to [[Watatsumi Island]] to get some more information for her thesis. Completely oblivious to the situation on the island, she is initially detained by [[Hiroyuki]] and [[Ookubo Daisuke]], only to be saved when the [[Traveler]] and fellow researcher [[Kaushik]] vouched her credibility as a Sumeru Akademiya researcher. Still helping Vahid with the fertiliser business, [[Gorou]] had her help [[Iwata]] with his fertiliser problem.

Once the Sakoku Decree was lifted, Alrani submitted her papers to her mentor, [[Niloofar]]. However, someone else had already submitted a paper with the same topic before her, causing her to become extremely depressed and run off to a group of [[Treasure Hoarders]] led by [[Narzam]], paying them to stay with the group and refusing to return to the Akademiya. Narzam accepted due to her principles and acknowledged that she had a bright future and could use her intellect. After writing a letter, she asked the Traveler to give it to her mentor.
