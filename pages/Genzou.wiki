:'''Genzou:''' Who are you? What is your business here?
:'''Genzou:''' If you're a commoner, you should leave now. If my superior comes in and finds you here, you'll be in deep trouble.
:{{DIcon}} Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
::'''Genzou:''' I'm just a soldier of the Shogunate. I am here on a mission with my superior.
::'''Genzou:''' I'm just a nobody compared to my superior, Sir Terada. No one really not worth mentioning, haha.
::{{DIcon}} Uh, so, about your boss...
::'''Genzou:''' What's with the suspicious tone? You think we're impostors?
::'''Genzou:''' I am a Shogunate officer, and this is my identification! Don't you dare be so rude!
::'''Genzou:''' As for Lord Terada, his status exceeds mine. How can the likes of you question his authority?
::'''Genzou:''' He is a humble man with many accomplishments, and he treats his subordinates with care and respect.
::'''Genzou:''' Ever since I started serving Lord Terada, I've never spent another day maintaining order, risking my life amidst the horrors of war, or going hungry.
::'''Genzou:''' There's no boss in the world who's better than him, so don't you dare make any trouble for him, you hear me?
:{{DIcon}} See you...
::'''Genzou:''' Leave now, and stay out of trouble.
