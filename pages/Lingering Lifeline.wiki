==Gameplay Notes==
* {{TalentNote|particles|4}}
* The Lifeline pulls opponents towards Yelan when it explodes.
* When Yelan's Breakthrough state is reset by this talent, a visual indicator will appear above her head.
* When Lingering Lifeline is held, the elemental skill icon changes.
* Yelan is still affected by [[Movement Speed]] when this skill is held.
* When Yelan's Lifeline marks an opponent, being [[stagger]]ed, jumping, sprinting, using a Normal Attack, or pressing the elemental skill button again will cause it to explode.
* Voice-overs for Lingering Lifeline will only play if at least one target is successfully marked.
