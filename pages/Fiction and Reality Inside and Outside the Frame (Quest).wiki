;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's finally time to meet up with everyone! Paimon even dreamt of making the film last night.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If Paimon remembers right, we're meeting at Hotel Debord. Let's get going!

;(Approach Hotel Debord)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Ayaka]]! [[Yoimiya]]! You're already here!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Good morning. [[Xavier]] said yesterday afternoon went well?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! And how about you, Ayaka? What were you up to yesterday?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' After we split up, [[Ayato]] went to see Iudex [[Neuvillette]] at the [[Palais Mermonia]].
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I was originally thinking of going with him, but he said he could manage it himself. He told me to go see the sights around Fontaine and to enjoy the local culture.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' So, I rode the aquabus with Yoimiya and visited the [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]] on Erinnyes island.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Yeah, you wouldn't believe what we saw there! [[Icewind Suite|Two mechanical puppets]] that were dancing together! You've already seen them, right?
:{{DIcon}} The Dirge of Coppelia...
:{{DIcon}} And the Nemesis of Coppelius...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Yeah, yeah, those two! Amazing, aren't they?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' We sat and watched for quite a while. It was mesmerizing, like we could keep watching them forever.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it was the same for us the first time we saw them, too.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Afterwards, we went swimming at the beach! Well, diving to be exact... It was the first time I ever breathed underwater!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I held Ayaka's hand and we counted down together... Three, two, one... And then, "splash!" we were beneath the waves.
:;(A flashback begins underwater)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' At first, I didn't dare to open my mouth. But once I couldn't hold my breath any longer, I decided to take a big breath in. Hehe, turns out the water wasn't as salty as I imagined... It didn't really taste like anything at all!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Before I knew it, I was breathing like normal down there! It was an amazing feeling! Ayaka said I was too nervous and needed to loosen my grip. She got used to everything way faster than I did!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I knew that {{Traveler}} could do it, so I had no doubt we could do it, too. That helped me feel at ease as soon as we dove in.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' The underwater world in Fontaine truly is beautiful. I loved seeing the [[Romaritime Flower]]s blossoming underwater, like little candles lighting up the streets at night.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Yeah, and there are so many creatures that we've never seen in [[Inazuma]]!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Like those fish that shimmer like a sword blade... Whoosh! Oh, and those big fish that call when they see people... "Woooo"!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean [[Hunter's Ray]]s and [[Blubberbeast]]s!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, I just love the name Blubberbeast. Just wait till pops and the others hear about this, they probably won't believe a word I say!
:;(Flashback ends)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Yoimiya was down there for quite a while. It was dark before we finally rode the aquabus back to the city. I figured she'd wanna sleep in today.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Yeah, even I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get up! I still felt like I was drifting in the waves when I went to sleep last night.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But as soon as I woke up today, I remembered that we'd all be shooting a film together, and I was ready to go!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of the film, where's everybody else?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 09.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' My brother and Xavier were speaking to the [[Vaneigem|restaurant owner]] about using the place as a filming location, they should be here soon.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' As for the others, they...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We're here.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Please excuse my tardiness. I just finished the Special Patrol's six-mile morning jog.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, six miles!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *yawn* I'm so tired... I heard you all chatting, so I decided to come down. I sure could use some of that endless energy everyone else has...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 11.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Good morning, everyone.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Morning... Can someone fetch me a cup of coffee? More milk, hold the sugar.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 12.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Sure, I'd be happy to do that for you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' {{sic|No. you}} can't go anywhere. Please have a seat over here so I can get started on your makeup. The last thing I want is coffee stains on my costumes.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 12.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I can get the coffee! It's the perfect job for an assistant!
:;(Yoimiya runs off, Ayaka goes to sit down, and Furina approaches the Traveler and Paimon)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So much energy... Seriously, what's her secret?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Yoimiya's always like that. But you sure look exhausted, Furina. It's because you're not used to waking up so early, huh?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Of course not! I spent the whole night reading the [[The Two Musketeers|novel]] from cover to cover, marking sections that either need to omitted or adapted.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Paimon didn't expect you to be so thorough!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Heh, well, I was the biggest star in all of Fontaine, after all. It takes more than just a pretty face to earn a reputation like that. I know how to get serious when the situation calls for it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I went all out when I was acting as an [[archon]], so why wouldn't I do the same for my own life?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 yoimiya 13.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Here's your coffee, Director Furina.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, thank you. Ah, the sound of being called "Director" and the aroma of coffee... feels almost as refreshing as hearing the birds chirping in the morning.
:;(Xavier, Ayato, and two other people arrive)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' It seems everyone has managed to arrive on time.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' We've reached an agreement with the restaurant owner. We are free to use the second floor to shoot our film.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? That's great!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' He is really looking forward to our film, and hopes that providing his restaurant as a filming location will attract more customers.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayato 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Well then, Mr. Xavier. I'll leave the rest to you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Okay, thanks!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' First, I'd like to introduce our new members...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' This is our prop manager, [[Veronique]]. She'll be in charge of all the film's props and items.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' And this is [[Bonnot]], our lighting technician. He'll be in charge of lighting and illumination to set up each scene's atmosphere.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, sure feels like we have some real professionals joining the crew now!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' First of all, please allow me to first express my sincerest gratitude to everyone in the crew.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 07.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' When my investor informed me yesterday that he wouldn't be able to provide the funds, I really thought that was the nail in the coffin for this film.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 08.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I had no idea that I'd find so many people willing to help me on such short notice. Thank you... Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayaka 13.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' No need to be so cordial, Mr. Xavier. We are all honored to be a part of this.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayato 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Your works made a profound impression on me when I saw them back in Inazuma.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 ayato 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' I am sure that someday, this film will be remembered as a prime example of cultural exchange between Fontaine and Inazuma.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Yes, the story is the reason I agreed to join. I can't bear to even imagine what this film would look like without the very best director.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 09.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Anyway, I would like to make a promise to everyone... That as the producer of this film, I'll do whatever I can to ensure that everything goes as smoothly as possible.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 10.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' This is not just my film. It also embodies the thoughts and feelings of every person here, as well as the endless effort we are about to pour into it!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 11.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' So, without further ado... "The Two Musketeers" will officially begin filming now!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 xavier 12.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' You may take it from here, Director Furina.
:;(The scene cuts to Furina seated on the sofa, with Yoimiya standing beside her and everyone else standing across her)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright. Listen up, everyone.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The first scene takes place when the two young musketeers are living at the baron's home, still unaware of all that is about to happen to them. We'll need props and lighting to set the scene. Our lead actors can go get their makeup done, and extras, please take this time to go over your positions...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, seems Furina's really kicking things into gear as the director.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Is everyone clear? I don't want anyone traipsing around the set like [[Finches|Umbrellafinches]].
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, Kameras will start rolling as soon as the set is ready! Let's make a film that'll make some serious waves in Fontaine!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Uh... not the kind of waves that drown everyone, I mean the good kind of waves...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, it seems like she's still a bit traumatized by [[Prophecy of Fontaine|that]]...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, let's go see if there's anything we can do to help!

;(Talk to Furina, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I don't need any help here, why don't you try asking someone else?

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayaka or Chevreuse, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Ah, so this is what a musket looks like.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Not exactly.

;(Talk to Chiori or Kamisato Ayato)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Ayaka has mentioned you to me before. She said that you two were great friends when you were kids.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No talking. I'm thinking about how to do your eyeshadow.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Ah yes, to help me really look the part.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' To achieve a more... young and naive look for this scene.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 ayato 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Are you saying the wrinkles around my eyes are too deep?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You just have too much of a calculating look in your eyes.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 ayato 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Hah, you sure don't mince your words. It seems you really haven't changed much.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 4 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Quiet.

;(Talk to Chiori or Kamisato Ayato again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...

;(Talk to Yoimiya)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' How about here?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 bonnot 01.ogg}} '''Bonnot:''' Hmm... A little more to the left.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' You got it!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Yoimiya, do you need a hand?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' No, no, I'm fine! Y'know, doing the lighting is kinda like designing a fireworks show. It's interesting to imagine what kind of atmosphere the lights will create!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I heard that {{Traveler}} will be operating the Kamera, and Paimon will be the clapper loader, right? Hehe, those roles are just perfect for the two of you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Is that because it'll be easy for Paimon to hold the clapperboard while flying?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Well, sure, there's that... But that's not exactly what I meant.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I just think that after all your journeys together, you two must have developed a super close bond, and just naturally know how to work with each other! If I'm not mistaken, the director will want the Kameras rolling as soon as the clapperboard goes "clack"!
:{{DIcon}} Actually, we start rolling before that.
:{{DIcon}} The clapperboard just gets edited out in post-production.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, I see! Haha, it's amazing to see the magic behind filmmaking!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 bonnot 02.ogg}} '''Bonnot:''' Yoimiya, we need lights over there, too!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh! On it!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I've gotta get back to work, chat with ya later. Oh, it's exciting to see so many people working together to bring the film to life!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like Yoimiya's really getting into it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But she was right, {{Traveler}}, we do have a super close bond, don't we?
:{{DIcon}} Of course!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's really happy to hear that!

;(Approach the group)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' So is this a real musket?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 veronique 01.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' No, it's just a prop weapon.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Not bad. Have you seen a real musket before?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 veronique 02.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' Only in books and newspapers. I made this one based on the relative shape and proportions I saw in reference images.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 veronique 03.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' When we're filming, some special gunpowder will be applied around the muzzle, which will help create the flash and smoke effects of a real gun being fired.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Which means it'll be up to the actors to portray the recoil.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 veronique 04.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' That's right. The sound effects for gunshots will also be added in post-production.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thank you, Veronique. I think I know where to start now.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' However, the muskets' gears and firing pin could still use some work. Adding some wear on the metallic components will make them appear more realistic.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Also, be sure to rub the muskets with some oil each time before we start shooting. That will give the impression that the firearms have been well-maintenanced.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 veronique 05.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' Good point!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' You seem to know a lot, Miss Chevreuse. I assume you use these types of firearms on a regular basis?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yes, I perform routine maintenance on my weapons every day. Just like we as people need to eat and sleep, muskets need to be cleaned and maintained.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I also perform similar care for my sword every day, and familiarize myself with its shape and weight... to the point where it feels like a natural extension of my body.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yes. This way, our weapons will never betray us in the heat of battle.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Yes, well said. It seems we have the same philosophy on this topic.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, sounds like they've found a common interest to talk about.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Though these props differ from the muskets I use, I can still give you some pointers.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Good, I look forward to your instruction.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' First and foremost, never point the weapon at anyone, regardless of whether it's a real or prop weapon, or whether you're holding it or it's on the table. This holds for any time when you're not actively engaging an enemy.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Okay, understood.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' When aiming the musket, extend your arm so that it is level with your shoulder, and use your eye to look down the weapon's sights.
:;(Ayaka holds the prop musket)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Like this?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 11.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Not bad. Now, try saying your lines.
:;(Ayaka strikes a dramatic pose with the prop musket)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...This is the end of the road for you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Good, now turn your body a little. That way, you will give your enemy less of a target to work with... And relax your shoulders. Here, allow me to demonstrate.
:;(Chevreuse demonstrates the pose)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 13.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...This is the end of the road for you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' ...
:;(Ayato, who has been watching Ayaka and Chevreuse, abruptly stands)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Excuse me, Miss Chiori.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Director Furina, there's something I wish to discuss with you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh? What is it?
:;(Meanwhile, Ayaka and Chevreuse continue practicing Ayaka's lines)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 09.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Like this?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 14.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yes, much better.
:;(The camera cuts back to Ayato and Furina)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' ...What do you think?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Mhm, I do see your point. But are you sure you wish to do this?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' I believe it would be most fitting.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, if you insist... Alright, I understand.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahem! Miss Ayaka, Miss Chevreuse, could the two of you please come over here?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What's going on? Are we gonna start filming now?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Let's go see.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 15.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' What is it?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I have a question for you, Miss Chevreuse. Would you be willing to play the role of a musketeer?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 16.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...What?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' To clarify, I would like to turn over my role to Miss Chevreuse.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 11.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But, brother...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Don't worry, Ayaka. I actually view this as a good thing.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' I was becoming troubled trying to set aside some time to speak to the staff at the Palais Mermonia. I would like to have some conversations about the cultural exchange between our two countries, and I've heard that the bureaucratic process here can get rather complicated.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 09.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Now, I will be able to focus on my work. Besides, you also know that I'm not really one for public performances.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 12.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...Are you really sure?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' From a director's point of view, I also felt like the relationship between the two musketeers in the original story could be improved.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The older brother in the story plays the lead role with his overbearing character. But this causes his character to overshadow that of his sister, and the theme of the two supporting and relying on each other isn't conveyed very well.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But if we were to change the siblings to two sisters of a similar age... then that aspect of the story might come through more clearly.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Also, I've seen you instructing Ayaka. That cold and dignified personality is exactly what we need for the older musketeer.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Of course, even with all of these insights, the decision should still be made by Miss Chevreuse.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 17.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chevreuse mentioned that she really likes this story, right? Paimon bets that she'll take the role.
:{{DIcon}} But she will still have to prioritize her work.
:{{DIcon}} But we still don't know if she's a big fan of acting.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 18.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Alright, I'll take the role.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Good, it's decided then. I'll get started on making edits to the script.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' We'll also need to make some immediate adjustments to the lighting, props, and costumes.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, I have a feeling that our adaption will be even better than the original story!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 11.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' You're doing a great favor for me, Miss Chevreuse. You have my gratitude.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 19.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Don't mention it. I like this character, so if anything, I should be the one thanking you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 13.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Well, since my brother is the one who brought up the idea, I suppose there's no need to worry.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayaka 14.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Let's go, Miss Chevreuse. I look forward to working with you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chevreuse 20.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Please, just call me Chevreuse.
:;(As Ayaka and Chevreuse talk, Chiori approaches Ayato)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Seems like you're really going out of your way to solve the problem I was having with your makeup.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 12.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Surely you jest, Chiori. I assure you that I was mostly motivated by a desire to spend more time on formal business.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh come on, you really think I'd buy that? According to what I've heard from Ayaka, her brother is someone who can juggle ten different matters at the same time. I'm sure you have other reasons for backing out.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 13.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Perhaps. Ayaka always said she wanted to go out and see more of the world, just like {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 14.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' But I feel that she needs not only to see other nations, but also to make some different kinds of friends. I think it would be harder for her to make new connections with me constantly by her side... I would like to give her some space.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Alright, go on, spoil her some more.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ayato! It's too bad you're stepping down from the role... Paimon really wanted to see you act as a musketeer.
:{{DIcon}} "This is the punishment you deserve!"
:{{DIcon}} "This is justice!"
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 15.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Heh, no need to poke fun at me. I'd wager that you also felt that I wasn't the best candidate for the role.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, it's a little hard for Paimon to imagine you saying those lines.
:{{DIcon}} So are you going to go back to work now?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 16.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Yes, I've made an appointment to meet some people from the Palais Mermonia. Now, I will have some more time to prepare.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' {{Traveler}}, get the Kamera ready! Paimon, get the clapperboard! Actors, to your positions! We're about to start shooting the first scene!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 17.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Go on, now. And please take good care of Ayaka.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, don't worry!
:{{DIcon}} You can count on us.
:{{DIcon}} Good luck with your work.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 7 ayato 18.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Thank you. I look forward to seeing the film when it's finished.

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 8 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The first scene takes place when our two main characters are still living at the baron's estate. They've been ostracized and verbally abused by others in the household, but they still have no idea why. We want to capture how naive and innocent they are, despite their pain.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 8 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Chevreuse will be playing the role of the older sister, Tulipe, and Ayaka will be the younger sister, Iris. Be sure to get close-ups of the main characters at the right moment.

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 8 elain 04.ogg}} '''"Rain":''' Then perhaps they're from when I accidentally tripped when I was out just now.

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 8 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''"Iris":''' And they even called us names... They said we were...

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 8 elain 10.ogg}} '''"Rain":''' You both have wonderful lives ahead of you. Just like your names... you will both blossom like beautiful flowers.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 8 elain 11.ogg}} '''"Rain":''' Maybe your time to blossom hasn't quite come yet, but one day, you two will bloom more beautifully than anything else.

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 8 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I felt fine, the lines weren't too difficult at all. Seems like Furina must have adapted the role nicely.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 8 elain 13.ogg}} '''Elain:''' Hehe, you two were great. I couldn't tell it was your first time acting in a film. You should have more confidence!

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 11 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Has anyone ever purchased components here as an individual, rather than on behalf of an organization?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 11 livre 05.ogg}} '''Livre:''' We have a lot of customers who buy toys, but those who buy components are all regular customers who buy in bulk on behalf of their organization.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 11 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Is that so? I understand. Thank you for your cooperation.

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 establet 03.ogg}} '''Estelle:''' I don't think so. Some people have requested that I make some prop guns for the Fontinalia Film Festival, but I refused all of those requests.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Why's that?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 establet 04.ogg}} '''Estelle:''' Because there's no profit! I only make things here that can do some real heavy lifting. I don't have the energy to make some new molds just for the festival.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Then, has anybody come specifically looking for mechanical components?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 establet 05.ogg}} '''Estelle:''' Well, I usually sell off my scrap to the [[Fleuve Cendre]]. I don't typically give them to one specific person.

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yeah, unfortunately. Alright, let's head to Fleuve Cendre next.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Are you sure? Uh, people might not be so thrilled to see the captain of the Special Patrol there.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You think so, huh? Then I guess you don't know...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Know what?

:{{A|vo dyjeq002 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, could it have been the killer!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 15 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Your guess is as good as mine. Although many people at Fleuve Cendre own guns, few hide the fact from others, and even fewer would go to such lengths to hide markings from practice shots.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 15 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Anyway, let's go. There might be more to this.

;(Observe the boxes again, optional)
:'''Observe:''' Some broken barrels and liquor bottles, some of which appear to have been shot with musket bullets.

;(Talk to Emerald)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Hello, I'd like to ask some questions.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 01.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' I don't know anything.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Don't worry, I'm not here to arrest anybody.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 02.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' You say that now...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' It's the truth. Here, take this as my guarantee.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, did Paimon just see what she thinks she saw? Is the captain of the Special Patrol bribing a citizen!?
:{{DIcon}} Shhh!
:{{DIcon}} Keep your lips sealed and no one will ever know.
:{{DIcon}} Besides, it's called "buying info."
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 03.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' Seems you're different from the other Gardes.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 04.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' What do you want to know?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Have you heard anything related to muskets in Fleuve Cendre lately? Anything at all...?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 05.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' Muskets, huh... All I know is that about two weeks ago, we started hearing some loud noises at night... So loud, that it's been waking me up.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Were they gunshots?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 06.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' Possibly, it's hard to tell around here.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 07.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' Someone's house collapsing, a pipe exploding somewhere... it's all the same. But the noises I'm talking about definitely happened after I fell asleep.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Do you know where the noises were coming from?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 08.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' I don't remember clearly...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Is it that you don't remember, or that you need to think about it some more?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 09.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' You tell me.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Then please, think about it some more.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? She's giving her even more Mora!
:{{DIcon}} I didn't see anything.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe she's just giving out some [[Pate de Fruit]].
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 10.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' The noises came from the end of the southern waterway. I came out and had a look for myself when I wasn't sleeping well, but I didn't dare to get too close.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 11.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' That's all I know.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Alright, I'll take your word for it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 emerald 12.ogg}} '''Emerald:''' Thanks for the Pate de Fruit.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' No need to be surprised. I grew up here, remember? I know how to get people around here to talk.
:{{DIcon}} What talk?
::{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 11a 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Seems you catch on pretty quick.
:{{DIcon}} I want some Pate de Fruit, too.
::{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 11b 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' My apologies. I'm all out of sweets.
::{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 11b 2.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Though, I do have some other tempting snacks in my custody &mdash; fries, fried chicken, and even onion rings.
::{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 11b 3.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But taking care of junk food is my responsibility. You're better off sticking to your normal, nutritious diet.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 14 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Now then, let's keep going.

;(Talk to Tetreaux)
:;(Chevreuse and the Traveler sit at the bar)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' It's been a while, Tetreaux.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 01.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' Please, just get on with your request.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I want to know if you've heard anybody talking about muskets lately.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 02.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' Information isn't free, you know.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I've heard that bandits have been extremely active in the countryside recently, and they've been affecting the delivery of goods to [[Poisson]]. I can allocate some more manpower to help out with that problem. What do you say?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 03.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' Hehe, you're still as helpful as ever.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 04.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' One of our men got drunk at dinner about a month ago, and lost his gun. Three days later, it turned up in the corner here.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's weird about that? He just forgot where he put it, right?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 05.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' This is Fleuve Cendre, my friend. Anything of value left in the tavern won't ever make it to the next day.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 06.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' But that gun turned out to be an exception. It didn't get any new wear and tear on it, and didn't even appear to have been fired. We were quite mystified as to what could have happened.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I suspect it came back because the weapon was already known to the Gardes.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 07.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' You mean, a criminal was afraid the Marechaussee Phantom would use the shot marks to track them down? Maybe... But if that's the case, the culprit really took great care to avoid getting caught.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I didn't say anything about a criminal.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 08.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' In Fleuve Cendre, knowing who was killed is as easy as knowing what clothes you're wearing today.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 09.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' It's the guy living in the east side, isn't it? I've never liked him. Every time he's here, he just orders a drink and sits there with a nasty look in his eyes.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So who was the one who lost the gun in the first place?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 10.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' Don't bother. Even if you ask, he wouldn't admit to owning a gun to some strangers, not to mention the captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...He's right.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 11.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' I know you grew up here, Chevreuse.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 12.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' Even though you're on good terms with the Spina, you've still been gone too long. Not many people know you here now, and a lot of people don't like the Special Patrol.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I know.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 13.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' So take my advice, and don't show your face too much around here. It's for your own safety.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I'll come and go as I please. And I'm afraid I'll be appearing more often due to my work.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 13 tetreaux 14.ogg}} '''Tetreaux:''' ...Alright, don't say I didn't warn ya.

;(After investigating all three locations)
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Seems like that's all we'll be able to uncover for today.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon feels like we managed to learn a lot more here than up on the surface!
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yes. Assuming that everything we found is indeed connected to our suspect, then their timeline was probably something like this...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' A month ago, our suspect found a gun and took it home to disassemble it. Once he'd figured out its mechanics, he brought it back.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' In the following weeks, he used some parts to create his own makeshift musket, and took it to the Fleuve Cendre for target practice.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Then, a few days ago, he found his target and carried out the murder. Once the deed was done, he left a Rainbow Rose on the body, just like the scene in the novel.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Hmm, that all makes sense to Paimon, but we're still no closer to figuring out the killer's identity!
:{{DIcon}} About the guy who died...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The deceased was a resident of Fleuve Cendre. It's said that he was a poor, solitary man.
:{{DIcon}} But if we're following the novel, shouldn't the guy have been a nobleman?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yeah... That's also something I'm trying to figure out.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' If we are indeed following the novel, and there's a story behind the murder, then his murder should be an act of vengeance. But according to our investigation, the deceased didn't have any enemies.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' He was no saint, but no one's heard of a rival who hated him enough to shoot him dead, much less care to leave a rose on his body.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' What message is the killer trying to convey, and to whom exactly?
:{{DIcon}} Could they be the novelist?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 11.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' We've thoroughly investigated that possibility.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' He claims to have spent the whole day at the opera house on the day of the murder, and the staff there have confirmed his account.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so he has an alibi...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 13.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Not only that, he lacks a credible motive as well.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 14.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' He has a family of his own and both of his parents are still alive. I've looked into his records... He was adopted at the age of six, and all the proper procedures were followed. There are also records of him at an {{sic|orphange}} before then.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 15.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' In the story, the mother of the two musketeers was murdered after the children turned ten. Of course, he could have changed the children's ages, but I don't want to assume anything without evidence.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 16.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' More importantly, I've also had a chat with him in person. He didn't seem like the kind of person who would pull the trigger to kill a man.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then what should we do now? We have all this new information, but it doesn't help us move forward...
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 17.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Investigations take time. I didn't expect us to catch the culprit in just a single day.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 18.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' How about this... Let's spend the next few days filming with the crew. We can continue the investigation once we're done with the film. I'm sure that given time, new leads will present themselves.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but weren't you saying intel is like "small, remote islands in the middle of the sea" just a moment ago? Wouldn't you just miss them if you were to stop looking?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 19.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Ah, but the book had more than one reference to the islands, Paimon.
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Oh? What else did it say then?
:{{A|vo dyjeq002 16 chevreuse 20.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' "As long as you spend enough time sailing through the fog, you'll eventually come across an island."

==Post-Quest Dialogue==
After completing this quest, Chevreuse can be found in the open world.
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Chevreuse in Fleuve Cendre)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' What? Never thought that the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol could come from the Fleuve Cendre?
:{{DIcon}} I have to say, I'm pretty shocked.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chevreuse 03a 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Honestly, I'm pretty shocked, too. There used to be a time when I thought I would never be able to join the Gardes.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure that wasn't easy...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chevreuse 03b 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You mean, rising through the ranks? It was a struggle, for sure.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But as long as you can distinguish yourself through your accomplishments and skills, you'll eventually be recognized for your worth.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' If you look at it another way, my life at Fleuve Cendre has actually taught me a lot of valuable skills.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Skills like... how to barter with criminals, or how to think in their shoes.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq002 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Of course, I'd appreciate it if you could keep this a secret between us.
