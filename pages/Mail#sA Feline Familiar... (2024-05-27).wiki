|text      = Hast thou ever borne witness to pink pads dancing amidst the softest of fluffy carpets, or to pupils beaming and gems alight with radiant gleam?

Swings plaited from twining vines of purple agate grapes, lamps of purest silver, candles set from sea salt scooped from the abyssal depths, platters branded with the seal of nighttide stars! All has been laid out, the symphony made ready to resound! Thine sound counsel has fallen upon the Prinzessin's appreciative ears — consider this summons the honor due unto thee for thine great deed.

Before the precious daylight fades like morning dew, hearken unto me, most trusted, blessed one, O newly elevated Cat Conjuror of Evernight — and hie unto mine palace and attend this banquet!
