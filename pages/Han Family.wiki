The '''Han Family''' was a notable family in [[Liyue]] that traces its roots back to the establishment of [[Liyue Harbor]]. Its first members were part of the [[Millelith]] and, alongside the Xing family, developed the [[Lithic Series]] weapons.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Lithic Blade|Description}}</ref>

Five hundred years ago, the Han Family still continued making weapons, and had their own forge. It is currently unknown if there are any descendants in the present day, but it is likely one of their descendants owns the [[Blackcliff Forge]].

==History==
===Archon War===
When Liyue Harbor was being built, a member of the Han family and Xing family were the first two to carve swords out of stone, carving [[Lithic Blade]]s out of the same bedrock Liyue Harbor was built on.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Lithic Blade}}</ref> These weapons were then used by the ancient Millelith, of which this Han ancestor was a member.
