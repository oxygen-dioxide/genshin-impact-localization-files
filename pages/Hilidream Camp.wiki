==Crafting Furnishings==
Combine any 3 materials out of a pool of 4 to craft a furnishing:
#The same material can be used more than once and the order in which you add the materials has no effect on the accuracy of the combination.
#The first furnishing of each day takes no time to make! But from the second furnishing onward, you will have to wait a set amount of time for crafting to complete: [[File:Hilidream Camp Crafting Attempts.png|400px|center]]
#*The timer will continue to count down as normal if you leave the event page.
#The only way to get materials is by completing event tasks. Select Get More Materials to open the task list.
#There is a set schematic combination for each type of furnishing. In a small number of cases, a schematic combination may result in a [[#Non-Furnishable Combinations|Strange Product...]]
#Once you start crafting a furnishing, the process cannot be canceled and the materials consumed cannot be retrieved. This is true regardless of the outcome of the process.
#*Struggling for inspiration? You can find some of the materials needed for locked furnishings in Crafting Notes.

==Loading Screen Tips==
*If you find yourself stuck, you can look through the Notes to see what materials you're missing for furnishings that have yet to be unlocked.
*Try new schematic combinations constantly and guide the hilichurls in making new furnishings!
*Adepti abodes are home to guardians known as teapot spirits, and each of these spirits comes with its own unique personality...
*Once furnishing crafting has begun, there is no stopping it, nor will the materials be refunded.
*Cumulatively unlock a certain number of furnishings to obtain the spirit's reward.
*When testing schematic combinations, the order in which materials are put in does not affect the schematic's accuracy.
*Click on some of the furnishings and see what happens...
*Careful work produces exquisite craft. The first furnishing of the day uses no time at all to craft, but each furnishing after that will require a little waiting.
*When testing schematic combinations, you can put in more than one of the same material.
*Each furnishing type corresponds to a fixed schematic combination, though some schematic combinations can produce something strange...
*You can customize the placement of unlocked furnishings to your liking on the Room Interior screen.
