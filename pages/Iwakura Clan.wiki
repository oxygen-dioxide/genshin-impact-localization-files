The '''Iwakura Clan''' is a large [[Martial Arts in Teyvat|martial arts]] (and potentially familial) clan in [[Inazuma]] founded by [[Iwakura Michihiro]] five hundred years ago, after he developed his unique sword technique known as the Tengu Sweeper.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Emblem of Severed Fate}}</ref>

The martial arts techniques passed down by the Iwakura Clan and those affiliated with the clan is known as the {{Lang|'''Iwakura Art'''|ja=岩蔵流}}. It is unclear whether there is a distinction between the Iwakura Clan and the Iwakura Art.

==Overview==
The Iwakura Clan is a group of martial artists that specialized in swordsmanship. Founded by [[Iwakura Michihiro]], the clan was particularly well known and is memorialized in an Inazuman folk song as "Iwakura the Successor."<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Mistsplitter Reforged}}</ref> Many of the members use the title "Iwakura Art" to show their affiliation to the clan dojo.

Like with other martial arts schools in Inazuma, there are several different proficiency levels in the Iwakura Art. The following are known proficiency levels:
# {{Lang|'''Soushu'''|ja=宗主|ja_tl=Clan Head}}: The highest rank within the Iwakura Art. Those at this rank who have also learned the clan's secret techniques affix their given name with {{Lang|"In" or "Tane"|ja=胤|ja_tl=lineage, descendant}};<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Iwakura Mitsunari|q=As a swordsman, they call me Iwakura Kouin.}}</ref><!--<ref> [[Eiin]]'s name ends with the -胤 suffix, but is translated as ''-tane'' in the English localization</ref> for example, {{Lang|''Doukei''|ja=道啓}} becomes {{Lang|''Douin''|ja=道胤}}. The sword {{Lang|"[[Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma]]"|ja=薄縁満光天目}} is passed down to each bearer of the "In" title.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Amenoma Kageuchi}}</ref>-->
# {{Lang|'''Menkyo Kaiden'''|ja=免許皆伝|ja_tl=Full Mastership}}: A high-level rank within the Iwakura Art.
# {{Lang|'''Okuden'''|ja=奥伝|ja_tl=Esoteric, Hidden}}: A mid-level rank within the Iwakura Art. Those at this rank can become {{Lang|Acting Instructors|ja=師範代|ja_tl=assistant instructor}}.
# {{Lang|'''Shoden'''|ja=初伝|ja_tl=Elementary, Basic}}: A low rank within the Iwakura Art.

==History==
The clan was founded by [[Iwakura Michihiro]] after redemption by [[Teruyo]] of the Yougou [[Tengu]]. He eventually developed a technique known as the "Tengu Sweeper," fast and powerful enough to catch even a Tengu. His techniques were noted by an unknown person(s) while he was still alive and they developed the [[Maguu Kenki]] series to imitate him, but they malfunctioned, went out of control, and were discarded. Two such puppets found their way onto [[Yashiori Island]], while another was stolen by members of [[Ako Domeki]]'s pirate crew and wound up in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] after they were separated from the rest.

In recent history, [[Eiin]] was the previous Soushu of the Iwakura Clan. He was its Master when [[Okazaki Toraemon]] and [[Okazaki Kunihiko]] were adopted, by which point [[Iwakura Mitsunari]], [[Shimada Shichirouji]], and [[Yanagiha Arashi]] were also members of the clan. Eiin was succeeded by Mitsunari, who learned the clan's secret techniques and took up the name "Iwakura Kouin," as well as the heirloom sword.<ref name="Iwakura Mitsunari">{{Ref/NPC|Iwakura Mitsunari}}</ref>

Since the war between the [[Watatsumi Army]] and the [[Shogunate]] broke out with the announcement of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], the Iwakura Clan has been scattered across Inazuma. Mitsunari had his [[Vision]] confiscated as part of the decree and chose to serve the Shogunate, seeing his decision as the "path of righteousness". Arashi and Toraemon were expelled from the clan, presumably for disagreeing with his decision. The rest of the clan's members, likewise, defected and went into hiding.<ref name="Iwakura Mitsunari" />

During the [[Traveler]]'s journey across [[Narukami Island|Narukami]], [[Kannazuka]] and [[Yashiori Island]], they encountered five Iwakura Clan practitioners. For various reasons of their own, these Iwakura Clan members attempt to kill them and are killed in self-defense. After slaying several Iwakura Clan members, speaking to Mitsunari at the [[Kujou Encampment]] has the Traveler reveal that they defeated them all. Seeing this as an offense towards the clan's reputation, and to avenge his fallen juniors, Mitsunari duels the Traveler, but is defeated and dies.

Arashi and Toraemon, who had been traveling across Inazuma, eventually learned of the Traveler killing Iwakura Art practitioners. They collected their fallen brethren's swords, apart from Mitsunari's, for a memorial in [[Byakko Plain]] at the same place where Kunihiko was killed. As they finished setting up the memorial, the Traveler encountered the two. After allowing the Traveler to listen into their conversation for a bit, the two rope the Traveler into a battle to avenge their fallen members, only to meet the same fate themselves. The Traveler then collects their swords and places them on the monument soon after.

With all its known practitioners dead and left without any known heirs, the Iwakura Clan has presumably died out. The Maguu Kenki, whose combat abilities were designed based on Doukei's techniques,<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Maguu Kenki}}</ref> are now the only remaining "practitioners" of the Iwakura Art.

==Notes==
*The ending of the last members of the clan is played out in "[[Iwakura Art's Downfall]]."

==Trivia==
*The ranks in the Iwakura Art are roughly based on the real-life ''{{w|menkyo}}'' martial arts license system. In real-life martial arts, the term {{Lang|''Soushu''|ja=宗主}} is relatively uncommon; {{Lang|''{{w|Sōke}}''|ja=宗家}} is typically used instead, although their meanings are ultimately the same.
*The clan may be inspired by the {{w|Yagyū Shinkage-ryū|Yagyuu Shinkage school}}, a Japanese martial art school officially patronized by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Notably the {{Lang|Tengu Sweeper|ja=天狗抄|ja_rm=Tengu-Shou|ja_tl=Tengu Raid}} is most likely a reference to a sword technique of the same name<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/u1ix3G95-QY Yagyu Shinkage Ryu: Tengu-Sho] (demonstration video)</ref> used by the school. See [[Iwakura Michihiro#Trivia]] for other details.
