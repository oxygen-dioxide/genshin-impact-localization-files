|text    = Hehe, it's Paimon's birthday again! Hmm... What should Paimon wish for this year?

Hey! Don't make fun of Paimon for waiting until now to think about it! Paimon actually secretly planned it all out when you weren't looking, okay! Eat delicious food, go somewhere fun... As long as Paimon's with you, it'll all come true! So no need to waste wishes on that.

Then the first wish is... to be together with you forever! No matter how tough the going gets, we'll make it through and be safe and sound at the end of it all!

The second wish... um, hey, if you make fewer wishes does the wishing effect get, like, concentrated or something? So it will definitely come true, right?

Then Paimon won't be greedy! It's enough to have you.

Okay, now stop teasing Paimon and bring out the cake, Paimon knows you've got one ready~!
