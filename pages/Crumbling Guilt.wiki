==Walkthrough==
# Jump down the hole in the floor and defeat the enemies in the room. {{Enemy List|Nobushi: Hitsukeban;Nobushi: Jintouban*2}}
# Activate the mechanism to head up the stairs. The Nobushi guarding it can be safely ignored. {{Enemy List|Nobushi: Hitsukeban*1}}
# Upon climbing to the top of the stairs, there is a [[Common Chest]] and a mechanism.
# Activate the mechanism and descend down the ladder back to the previous area.
# Go back up the stairs and glide down southwards to a platform to enter another room containing a visible locked chest. {{Enemy List|Nobushi: Hitsukeban*2;Nobushi: Jintouban*2;Nobushi: Kikouban}}
#* The statue at the back can be interacted with to remove the {{Color|Electro}} buff on the enemies.
# Defeat the enemies to unlock the [[Exquisite Chest]]. A set of doors will also open.
# Exit the room through the doors and climb up a ladder to obtain a '''Common Chest'''. Head back down the ladder.
# Activate a third mechanism to rotate the stairs. Then, open the nearby door to the left (as marked by the quest waypoint) and return to the first mechanism.
# Head up the stairs and keep going straight. Be careful not to fall through the gap.
# Open the Common Chest to the left and then head right down the hallway. Be careful of {{Electro}} arrows.
# Enter the room holding the hostages and defeat the enemies. {{Enemy List|Nobushi: Hitsukeban*2;Nobushi: Hitsukeban*2}}
# Open the [[Precious Chest]], and Common Chest in one of the holding cells.
# Next, head north to activate a fourth mechanism that lifts up the stairs.
# Return to the room, head west, and go down the ladder. Then, go to the left and activate both mechanisms.
#* One mechanism is below a hanging pot on fire.
#* Another mechanism is guarded by a Nobushi in Step 2.
# Turn around, climb up the ladder, and enter the room which previously held the hostages.
# Head up to the top of the stairs to the north. Jump across the gap to open an '''Exquisite Chest'''.
# Go back down the stairs, head right, and descend down the ladder again.
# Go left and activate the mechanism below the hanging pot on fire. This rotates a part of the stairs again.
# Return up the ladder and up the stairs. Enter the new room. {{Enemy List|Nobushi: Hitsukeban*2;Nobushi: Jintouban*3;Nobushi: Kikouban}}
#* The two statues can be interacted with to remove the {{Color|Electro}} buff on the enemies.
