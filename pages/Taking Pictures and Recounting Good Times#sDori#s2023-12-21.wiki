;Today is [[Dori]]'s birthday, let's go and celebrate with her!
:'''Paimon:''' It's already gotten so late. Dori sure works hard even on her birthday.
:'''Traveler:''' You should go rest if you're feeling tired.
:'''Dori:''' This is a precious opprtunity to expand my business! I'm feeling more energetic than ever.
:'''Dori:''' Look at all these contracts. These were all freshly signed tonight~
:'''Traveler:''' That's a lot of contracts! You're amazing.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa&mdash; Paimon thinks she can already see the mountains and mountains of Mora.
:'''Dori:''' If the two of you weren't going off to Fontaine, I definitely would've invited you to the upcoming banquet as well.
:'''Dori:''' The presence of the famed Traveler would definitely attract even more people to attend, which means more potential business deals for me, hehe~
