'''Formulas''' are one of the types of '''Crafting Blueprints''' and are similar to [[recipe]]s, but are used for [[alchemy]]. Once used, the player will learn to make the associated [[item]].

Formulas are earned through [[World Quest]] rewards or bought at [[Fishing Association]]s. The formula's quality is equal to the item's quality.
