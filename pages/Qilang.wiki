==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Qilang is an herbalist that spends his days picking herbs around the abode of [[Moon Carver]], the adeptus. In his youth, he spent many hours reading books from the [[Wanwen Bookhouse]], which is where he obtained his knowledge of herbs.
He has now made a business of it and even sells herbs to [[Bubu Pharmacy]].

This has taken a toll on his body however as he has spent so many hours bent over picking herbs, that he now suffers from severe lower-back pain, to the point that he can barely even bend down to pick said herbs anymore.

==Dialogue==
{{dialogue start}}
:'''Qilang:''' Hey there! Gee, you look as fit as a fiddle! Can't say I don't envy you...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Qilang:''' The name's Qilang. I'm nobody special, I just come here to pick herbs.
::'''Qilang:''' I used to spend all my time down at the [[Wanwen Bookhouse]], devouring every book on the natural world I could get my hands on.
::'''Qilang:''' I never thought that knowledge would actually come in useful for earning a living.
::'''Qilang:''' I know every herb and its use off by heart now. Even [[Bubu Pharmacy]] buys its medicinal herbs from me.
::'''Qilang:''' It's take its toll on me though... All this time spent bent over picking herbs has done my lower back in. Now it hurts every time I bend down... *grimace*
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Qilang:''' Bye then!
