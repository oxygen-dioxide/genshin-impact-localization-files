==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Qilang is an herbalist that spends his days picking herbs around the abode of [[Moon Carver]], the adeptus. In his youth, he spent many hours reading books from the [[Wanwen Bookhouse]], which is where he obtained his knowledge of herbs.
He has now made a business of it and even sells herbs to [[Bubu Pharmacy]].

This has taken a toll on his body however as he has spent so many hours bent over picking herbs, that he now suffers from severe lower-back pain, to the point that he can barely even bend down to pick said herbs anymore.
