'''Places of Essence Worship''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Enkanomiya]]. They have different states in [[Whitenight]] and [[Evernight]]; their state always matches the current "day-night" state.

Approaching one will imbue the player with an aura of Whitenight (yellow) or Evernight (blue), allowing them to temporarily interact with mechanisms of that state. Notably, during Whitenight, approaching broken [[Triangular Mechanism]]s or [[Daises of Day and Night]] while carrying the power of Evernight will restore them.

Places of Essence Worship will go into cooldown after each use. The aura will dissipate after 2 minutes or if the player moves too far away, at which point the cooldown will end.
