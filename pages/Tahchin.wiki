|description     = A classic staple served in large quantities.
|desc_suspicious = Its dark-colored shell looks rather suspicious. A bite into its hardened surface feels like a duel between the teeth and the food. For the sake of your poor teeth, you decide to only eat the fillings...
|desc_basic      = Cooked rice is mixed with meat that was marinated in yogurt, then baked until its surface turns crispy. Don't forget to add a handful of Padisarah petals before serving! Both the rice and meat are enough to keep one's stomach full for a long time, making it a very popular dish at the Grand Bazaar.
|desc_delicious  = With the first bite, the crispy outside cracks with delightful crunching sounds. The second bite combines the soft and moist rice with juicy meat in your mouth. Then, the third bite brings in the Padisarah's fragrance... The last bite, however, leaves your heart empty. What a pity it is, that you are too full to continue this wondrous experience. Well then, why not have another serving tomorrow?
