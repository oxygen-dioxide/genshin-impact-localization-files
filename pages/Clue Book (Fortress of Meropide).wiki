|The strange [[Welfare Meal]] received after violating the hidden rules of the production zone.

|The research notes said that the [[Melusine]] race perceives the world very differently from humans. As a result, the Melusines have also developed a sense of aesthetics that appears rather strange and alien to humans.

{{A|vo fdaq103 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Paimon wonders how she looks to a Melusine's eyes. Oh, Paimon's super curious now!

|width=150px|[[File:Clue Book The Supervisor, Sigewinne.png|100px]]<br>The Supervisor, Sigewinne
|We often see [[Sigewinne|Miss Sigewinne]] observing the prisoners at work near the production zone. It seems like she can perceive the general state of a person's health just by looking at them.

{{A|vo fdaq103 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we could replace that mean ol' foreman with Sigewinne, then productivity in the production zone would skyrocket, don't you think?

|I've been told that the infirmary is always empty for the half hour just before lunch. But what could Sigewinne be doing during that time?

{{A|vo fdaq103 20 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bet they couldn't wait for lunch to start so they stole some food from the cafeteria. Paimon totally gets that!

|width=150px|[[File:Clue Book Sponsor of the Pankration Tournament.png|100px]]<br>Sponsor of the Pankration Tournament
|According to [[Collins]], the pankration tournament only took place because the [[Fonta]] company sponsored it. The company must want a return on their investment as well.

{{A|vo fdaq103 20 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Fonta Co. is sponsoring events at the Pankration Ring. Sponsorships cost money, so they've gotta be making a profit somehow, right?
|-
|[[File:Clue Book New Products Under Development.png|100px]]<br>New Products Under Development
|Fonta's internal reports suggest that they're starting a new trial of an as-yet unnamed and unpackaged product. The product has to undergo a trial because even Fonta's own employees have a lot of reservations about it.

{{A|vo fdaq103 20 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There'll be a trial for the new drink. That means we'll be able to try it for free, right?
|-
|[[File:Clue Book Dissatisfaction with the Duke.png|100px]]<br>Dissatisfaction with the Duke
|The Fonta promoter has been struggling because he doesn't recognize the real value of coupons. [[Wriothesley|The Duke]] believes that only idiots who don't understand the value of coupons will spend them on Fonta.

{{A|vo fdaq103 20 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bet the Fonta promoter would get the value of [[Credit Coupons]] pretty quickly if he had to work every day like us...
