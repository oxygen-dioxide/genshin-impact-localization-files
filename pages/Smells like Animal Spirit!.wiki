'''Smells like Animal Spirit!''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat a [[Pyro Hypostasis]] after being hit by its mimetic 3-hit combo.

==Gameplay Notes==
*The third and final part of the combo can be deceptive: the Pyro Hypostasis will explode, and generate a swarm of butterflies. The explosion does not count for the achievement. In order to fulfill the conditions for the achievement, the player must be hit by the butterfly swarm after the explosion. Otherwise, the achievement cannot be completed.
