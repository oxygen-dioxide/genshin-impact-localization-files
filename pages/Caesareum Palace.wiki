{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Caesareum Palace|It|Caesareum Palace}} used to be a training area for the legions of [[Remuria]]. In addition, it was used as a place to store [[Scylla]]’s chains.</p>}}

In the conflict against Scylla, [[Boethius]] ordered Legio VI Rithimi Versi of the Legion Athanatoi to hold back the [[Vishap|Dragonborn]] forces at this site. According to ancient records, they defended it until the end &mdash; not a single member deserted, and not a single enemy made it through.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Symphony of Yore, Restored Once More}}</ref>
