==Description==
As the nights deepen, the pulsing of its gills translates as such:

"Well now, I was undoubtedly dead when I left the sea."<br />
"My heart ceased to beat, the whites of my eyes showed, I gave off a rank stench&mdash;"<br />
"I mean, for a fish, this had to be death, right?"

"Now, these old bones were the strongest among all mackerel."<br />
"I was also once the strongest being in all the shallow seas,"<br />
"And even sea beasts, whales, and sharks were no match for my might."<br />
"And yet, even I would meet my match!"<br />
"It was that kurage, or perhaps you might call them the jellyfish."<br />
"Why, they just float along with the tide,"<br />
"And yet, they can deflect any and all impacts."

"So then did I forsake the path of strength,"<br />
"Taking up the path of the jellyfish."<br />
"After a long, long life,"<br />
"I became able to control every organ in my body."<br />
"So I stopped my own heart,"<br />
"And was not mistaken for fresh fish and sliced open."<br />
"You may think that I am naught but a salted fish, 'tis true,"<br />
"But allow me to become your strength."

"Now then, you who wield this old one."<br />
"Hmm..."<br />
"When all the waters flow into the sea,"<br />
"When the final stars go out,"<br />
"When everything returns to the primordial ocean whence they came,"<br />
"Would you try yourself against me?"

==Trivia==
*The weapon seems to be a reference to the [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:One Salty Tuna|One Salty Tuna]] Katana seen in ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', another video game developed by [[MiHoYo]].
*Concerning the lord's species, the English version says they were a mackerel, which usually (but not always) refers to fish from the family ''{{w|Scombridae}}''. The original Chinese version is more specific in this regard, stating that the lord was a {{Lang|''chūnyú''|zh=䲠鱼}}, which is a common name for the genus ''{{w|Scomberomorus}}'' (a member of Spanish mackerels), especially the species ''{{w|Japanese Spanish mackerel|Scomberomorus niphonius}}'' (Japanese Spanish mackerel), popular fish in East Asian cuisine.
**Note that the lord and summoned fish by Oceanic Victory are from different species, as the lord is from the tribe ''{{w|Spanish mackerel|Scomberomorini}}'' (Spanish mackerel), whereas summoned fish are {{Lang|tunas|''wěi''|zh=鲔|zh_rm=wěi}}, or the tribe ''{{w|Tuna|Thunnini}}'' (though they both belong to the family ''Scombridae'').
*The original English description of {{Lang|titanic ''wei'' (tuna)|zh=大鲔|zh_rm=dà wěi|zh_tl=big tuna}} may be a pun on {{Lang|"Big Wei"|zh=大伟|zh_rm=Dà Wěi}}, that is, miHoYo's CEO Liu Wei.
