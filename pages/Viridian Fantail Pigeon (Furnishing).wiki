|description    = The beautiful Viridian Fantail Pigeon is a close relative of the pigeon. Although if properly trained they too can carry messages over long distances, few ever use them for that purpose.<br>These birds possess viridian plumage and fan-shaped tail feathers which bear a resemblance to the Jadeplume Terrorshroom, which acted as a powerful deterrence against animals from Sumeru while in the Realm Within. As the animals from Sumeru showed deference toward them, the others followed suit for no apparent reason, and so these birds inexplicably have become exceptionally well-respected...
