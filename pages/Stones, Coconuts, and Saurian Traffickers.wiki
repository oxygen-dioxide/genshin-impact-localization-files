;(Approach Qax)
:'''???:''' What do we do...
;({{Cx}}){{Verify}}
::'''???:''' My friend, please, just say something. Even a growl would be fine &mdash; I just need to know what's happened to you.
::'''Debilitated [[Tepetlisaurus]]:''' ...Hrrooh?
::'''???:''' ...Nope, don't get you at all.
::'''Paimon:''' Even if it were {{Little One}}, such a simple statement alone wouldn't be enough to get anything across to us right away.
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehrrr?
::{{DIcon}} ...So uh, what kind of trouble are you in, exactly?
::{{DIcon}} Do you need a hand?
::'''???:''' Ah, passing adventurers. We're saved!
::'''???:''' Thank you so much, kind souls! Here's the situation in a nutshell...
::'''Qax:''' I'm Qax, a traveling merchant. I was out fetching water today when I got separated from my Saurian, King Coconut.
::'''Qax:''' When I got back, my dear Saurian had been hurt somehow, and had fallen down on the side of the road, unable to walk...
::'''Qax:''' I thought maybe he'd set off a hunter's trap, but closer inspection didn't reveal any wounds on his leg or blood spatter on his body... Could it have been blunt trauma?
;({{Cx}})
::'''???:''' My friend, please, just say something. Even the slightest peep would be fine &mdash; I just need to know what's happened to you.
::'''Debilitated Tepetlisaurus:''' ...Grr?
::'''???:''' ...Nope, don't get you at all.
::'''Paimon:''' Even if it were {{Little One}}, such a simple noise wouldn't be enough to get anything across to us right away.
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Errh?
::{{DIcon}} ...So uh, what kind of trouble are you in, exactly?
::{{DIcon}} Do you need a hand?
::'''???:''' Ah, it's master {{Traveler}} and master Paimon. Saved at last!
::'''???:''' It's a pleasure to meet the pair of you! Here's the situation, in a nutshell...
::'''Qax:''' I'm Qax, a traveling merchant. I was out fetching water today when I got separated from my Saurian companion, King Coconut.
::'''Qax:''' When I got back, my dear Saurian had been hurt somehow, and had fallen down on the side of the road, unable to walk...
::'''Qax:''' I thought maybe he'd set off a hunter's trap, but closer inspection didn't reveal any wounds on his leg or blood spatter on his body... Could he have sprained his ankle or something?
:'''"King Coconut":''' Rroooh! Hroo! Rrooooh!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like your Saurian buddy's in great pain. Neither {{Traveler}} nor Paimon's a sauro-vet, though...
:{{DIcon}} Should I carry King Coconut back?
::'''Paimon:''' Well, you could certainly do it, given your strength.
::'''Paimon:''' But this place is kinda out of the way. If we carry him for too long and open up some unseen wounds while we're at it, we'd just make things worse...
;({{Cx}}){{Verify}}
::{{DIcon}} Should we track down a sauro-vet to help out?
:::'''Paimon:''' Sure, but we aren't exactly familiar with any vets...
:::'''Paimon:''' If we were to show up in front of a sauro-vet we don't know and ask him to come out to this remote spot, wouldn't we get suspected of being up to no good?
::'''Qax:''' Oh, I wouldn't ask you to do that. I know an [[Ifa|itinerant sauro-vet]] from the Flower-Feather Clan who heads out to fixed locations to make medical calls. I'll ask him to come over.
::'''Qax:''' Could you two please help me take care of King Coconut for a while? I'll be back real soon &mdash; one night, tops.
;({{Cx}})
::{{DIcon}} Should we track down a sauro-vet to help out?
:::'''Paimon:''' Sure, but we aren't exactly familiar with any vets...
:::'''Paimon:''' If we were to show up in front of a sauro-vet we don't know and ask him to come out to this remote spot, wouldn't he think he might be in for some kind of crazy challenge?
::'''Qax:''' Oh, I wouldn't ask you to do that. I know an itinerant sauro-vet from the Flower-Feather Clan who travels about often. I'll ask him to come over.
::'''Qax:''' Could you two please help me take care of King Coconut for a while? I'll be back real soon &mdash; in one night, tops.
:'''Paimon:''' Heh, you're pretty considerate, huh? Alright, guess we can just treat this like a camping trip &mdash; we'll have a good rest, and treat your Saurian buddy to some tasty grub while we're at it!
:'''Paimon:''' Eating some of {{Traveler}}'s food should take the edge off a bit.
:{{DIcon}} I just so happen to be tired right now, too...
:{{DIcon}} I just so happen to be starving right now, too...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, now that we've mentioned camp, we'll need a campsite. King Coconut's injured, so he'll need shelter from the elements. Staying here isn't an option.
:'''Paimon:''' We'll have to slowly shift King Coconut over to some flat ground, erect a tent, get a pot set up, and light a fire...
:'''Qax:''' That makes sense. You really are pro adventurers, huh?
:'''Qax:''' I'm good at woodwork, so let's split up and gather the required materials &mdash; just some common {{Color|buzzword|Flammabomb Wood|link=1}} or {{Color|buzzword|Ashen Aratiku Wood|link=1}} plus a little cloth oughta do it!
:'''Paimon:''' Would you mind keeping King Coconut company in the meantime, {{Little One}}?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:{{Black Screen|You carefully shift King Coconut over to a suitable area and start to build a camp...}}

;(Investigate the marked locations)
;(Obtain {{Item|Nearby Flammabomb Wood|x=5}} and {{Item|Nearby Ashen Aratiku Wood|x=2}})

;(Talk to "King Coconut", optional)
:'''"King Coconut:''' Wrooo...

;(Talk to "King Coconut" while [[indwelling]] a Saurian, optional)
:'''"King Coconut:''' It hurts... It hurts...

:'''Qax's Gear:''' (Rucksacks and boxes packed with various daily necessities. Looks like Qax is running a small business. Place the materials you've gathered here. You can start building a camp in a moment.)
:{{DIcon}} Place Materials
:;(Submit {{Item|Nearby Flammabomb Wood|x=5}})
::'''Paimon:''' Great &mdash; now we can put up a huge camp tent!
:{{DIcon}} We still need to gather more materials...

;(After submitting the wood)
:{{Black Screen|Qax returns after a while, carrying a few logs. He pulls out a pot and some fabric from his bag.<br>Paimon has picked up a bunch of branches and is using them to make a fire to cook with...}}
:{{Black Screen|Qax is very dexterous and, with your help, has soon built a hut. Paimon and {{Little One}} set up a pot, and ignite some kindling...}}
:'''Qax:''' Alright, that's our camp done and dusted. Thanks for all your hard work!
:'''Qax:''' It's pretty basic, so not the best accommodation. But please make do for now. I'll repay you all later for sure!
:{{DIcon}} You've also done quite a bit.
:{{DIcon}} You don't have to be so polite.
:'''Qax:''' Then I shan't ramble on. I'll get going and find a vet as soon as possible.
:'''Qax:''' Both so King Coconut can recover faster, but also so as not to keep you waiting!
:'''"King Coconut":''' *whimper*
:'''Paimon:''' This traveling merchant's quite the straight shooter, and practical, too... Let's hope he can find a vet soon.
:'''Paimon:''' Next up, time for us to get camping, cooking, and eating together!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:{{Black Screen|You prepare food by the fire with Paimon, and cook up several of your specialty dishes &mdash; including a sick meal that's easy on the stomach, made especially for King Coconut.<br>Afterwards, everyone enjoys a casual, filling meal together. Paimon and {{Little One}} feed the debilitated King Coconut.}}
:{{Black Screen|After the meal, {{Little One}} patiently stays with King Coconut, helping him relax, and his condition improves. <br>You chat with Paimon until midnight, and everyone in the camp falls into a peaceful slumber...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Mmm~ Paimon slept so well! Guess it was all that hard work yesterday, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, {{Traveler}} &mdash; King Coconut's turned into a [[Qucusaurus]]!
:{{DIcon}} You're still dreaming, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} King Coconut is inside the tent.
:{{DIcon}} This is clearly a different Saurian.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... Gee, that was freaky. For a moment there, Paimon thought that the food we made had some weird ability to change Saurians or something...
:'''[[Weakened Qucusaur]]:''' Arowr... *cough*... Aoowrr...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Errh?
:'''Paimon:''' It seems like this Qucusaurus is also in a lot of pain. Perhaps it's also been involved in an accident?
:{{DIcon}} It has no obvious wounds.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps it's taken some blunt trauma, just like King Coconut?
:'''Paimon:''' That's two Saurians collapsing near this place two days in a row now... Something's fishy about this for sure!
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, why don't you think up a way to communicate with them and ask what happened?

;(Talk to "King Coconut" or the Weakened Qucusaur, optional)
:'''"King Coconut":''' Wrooo...
:'''Weakened Qucusaur:''' Awrowr... *cough*!

;(Talk to the Weakened Qucusaur while indwelling a Saurian)
:'''Weakened Qucusaur:''' Bad guys... In the hills... Threw stones... It hurt...
:'''Weakened Qucusaur:''' I... ran...
:'''"King Coconut":''' Many... Bad guys... Beat me... Secretly...
:'''"King Coconut":''' Qax came back... And they left...
:'''Paimon:''' What's up? Any idea what's going on?
:{{DIcon}} They seem to have been attacked.
:{{DIcon}} The attackers were on the hill over there.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Attacked by bad guys? From the hill over there?
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has not been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' Were those bad guys just trying to hunt wild Saurians? But if it was an accident, we didn't see 'em apologizing to Qax or King Coconut...
::'''Paimon:''' Or... are they poachers, waiting to steal other people's Saurian buddies instead?
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, do you still remember? We've been around here before... We rescued tons of Saurians and other animals from some poachers.
::'''Paimon:''' Could it be the same people? And they're trying to steal Saurian companions... Are they seriously looking to resell them?
:'''Paimon:''' Never mind that... Anyone hiding behind the scenes and harming the Saurian companions of others is pure scum. We can't just let them go!
:{{DIcon}} Yup, they're just the worst sort of people.
:{{DIcon}} I sure won't be going easy on them.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Then let's get moving now, and scout the area.
:'''Paimon:''' If they don't have anyone particularly strong with them, we should just take action and round them up &mdash; just like how we've rounded up [[Treasure Hoarders]] in the past!
:'''Paimon:''' Not that we'd be scared even if they've got some capable members. We just can't show them our hand when it comes to our counterattack, or they'll escape!

;(Talk to "King Coconut" or the Weakened Qucusaur, optional)
:'''"King Coconut":''' Hrooo... Aoowrrr!
:'''Weakened Qucusaur:''' *cough* *hack*!

;(Talk to "King Coconut" or the Weakened Qucusaur while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''"King Coconut":''' Must be careful... Must be careful!
:'''Weakened Qucusaur:''' Don't get hit, or it's gonna hurt!

;(Approach the camp)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, are we close? Paimon can hear someone muttering away...
;(If the Treasure Hoarders and Oeno were not defeated in [[Friends of Fire and Water]] world quest) <!-- condition is NOT not-completing "Friends of Fire and Water"; might be reverse -->
::'''Sinister Voice From Above:''' It's a real shame that Qucusaurus got away. That quality would fetch top [[Mora]], no doubt about it...
::'''Sly Voice From Above:''' It's cool. The boss enhanced the frangible rounds. The new models could knock a [[Tatankasaurus]] out cold without even leaving a trace!
::'''Sly Voice From Above:''' Once those new rounds have been distributed amongst us, we'll be able to capture whichever Saurians we like. We'll strike it rich sooner or later!
::'''Paimon:''' Hear that? Those guys seem to wanna resell Saurian companions... Those low-down, no-good poachers!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Wow, {{Little One}}, you sounded a little different just then! Looks like those guys have really riled you up, huh?
;(If the Treasure Hoarders and [[Oeno]] were defeated in [[Friends of Fire and Water]] world quest) <!-- condition is NOT completing "Friends of Fire and Water"; might be reverse -->
::'''Sinister Voice From Above:''' Gah, what crappy luck! Last time, it was that blonde {{MC|m=boy|f=girl}} and the white-haired fairy who cost me a big paycheck, releasing all the animals I had on me like that. And just now, that Qucusaurus escaped yet again...
::'''Sly Voice From Above:''' *sigh* If nothing else, we've got the boss and his enhanced frangible rounds. They're guaranteed to knock even the strongest Tatankasaurus out without leaving a trace!
::'''Sly Voice From Above:''' Once the boss's new rounds are mass-produced, we'll put this one to bed in no time...
::'''Paimon:''' Hear that? It really is those nasty Saurian poachers and animal traffickers from back then. C'mon, let's round 'em all up this time!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Wow {{Little One}}, you sounded a little different just then! Don't worry, we'll get justice for your Blubberbeast friend this time!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrr...
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of that, {{Little One}} &mdash; do you think you could sneak up to their camp from below and check out what's going on?
:'''Paimon:''' If you find anything important of theirs in the camp, destroy it &mdash; let's create some chaos!
:'''Paimon:''' But if things aren't looking too good, just get out of there and leave things up to us. Always focus on your safety first!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hrrmm!

;(If the player approaches the camp)
:{{Black Screen|The cunning Saurian traffickers were on high alert. As soon as they saw someone attacking, they took to their hot air balloon and fled...}}

;(If Open the Saurian Cart was selected first)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' (First go, open, big carty door.)

;(If Open the iron cage was selected first)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' (Holey iron basket, bad! Free other Saurian!)

;(Abandoning the challenge)
:'''Paimon:''' Hang on a sec, Paimon just remembered something important! Come back for now, {{Little One}}!

;(After selecting the wrong order)
:;(If selected order starts with Blow up the Explosive Barrel(s))
::'''Panicked Calm Saurian Trafficker:''' Huh? What's a Tepetlisaur whelp charging over there for?
::'''Seemingly Calm Saurian Trafficker:''' First time I've seen a Saurian serving itself up on a platter!

:;(If selected order starts with Open the Saurian Cart)
::'''Seemingly Calm Saurian Trafficker:''' What's going on? I thought I heard a weird noise... Could a Tepetlisaurus have come back to rescue its friend?
::'''Seemingly Calm Saurian Trafficker:''' Haha, looks like you're one unlucky devil!
:{{Black Screen|Unfortunately, {{Little One}} was discovered by the Saurian traffickers...}}
;(Restart stealth section)

;(After selecting the correct order)
;(Correct order<nowiki>:</nowiki> Open the iron cage, Blow up the Explosive Barrel(s), Open the Saurian Cart)
:'''Panicked Saurian Trafficker:''' Tch, why's the cage door open..? Hey, you lot! Screw your heads on properly, yeah?
:'''Seemingly Calm Saurian Trafficker:''' What the... Don't even try to resist!
:'''Panicked Saurian Trafficker:''' What's going on!? Why did the propellant barrel for the frangible rounds explode!? ...And our transport hot air balloon is toast, too!
:'''Seemingly Calm Saurian Trafficker:''' No, isn't the new client checking out their goods tomorrow? What're we gonna do, Boss?
:'''The One They Called "Boss":''' What else can we do? First, we need to control these Saurians and animals! Otherwise, how else can we go get our backup balloon? What, you lot want to see my good name and reputation as "Oeno, the Gilded Dragonclaw" ruined in a day!?
:'''Panicked Saurian Trafficker:''' Another one of the big cages has a problem with the door! So many accidents, one after the other... This is nuts!
:'''Seemingly Calm Saurian Trafficker:''' Oh no oh no... I'm done for, who the hell can deal with this!?
:'''The One They Called "Boss":''' Wait, something's not right... there's something active underground... Could it be a Tepetlisaurus, come back for revenge?
;(Exit stealth section)

:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... That was scary. Great job, {{Little One}}!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like the camp is a real mess! Let's hit 'em now, and take them all out in one go!

;(After defeating the enemies)
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has not been completed)
::'''Saurian Trafficker Boss:''' Trying to stop us from making our fortune, are you!? Get ready to pay with your head!
::'''Paimon:''' Quit bragging! C'mon, {{Traveler}}, stop {{sic|him|expected=her}}!<!-- Iktomisaurus Warrior: Cryocrystal Cannons are feminine, and Paimon later refers to the boss as "her," so these male pronouns are likely incorrect -->
::'''Saurian Trafficker Boss:''' To think I almost lost everything due to a meddling kid like you... I'll get you next time!
::'''Paimon:''' {{sic|He|expected=She}} sure is quick to run!
::'''Paimon:''' And what does {{sic|he|expected=she}} mean by "next time"... "Next time," we'll beat {{sic|him|expected=her}} senseless!
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has been completed)
::'''Saurian Trafficker Boss:''' What? You again!? You're always getting in our way... But not this time! This time, I'm taking your head!

::'''Saurian Trafficker Boss:''' What the... Beaten by some kid... What a joke!
::'''Paimon:''' There's nothing funny about this!
::'''Paimon:''' You've hurt so many Saurians and animals just for profit &mdash; you're getting what you deserve!
----<!-- screen goes to black for a few seconds, then reappears) -->
;(Talk to Paimon)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew! Not only did we destroy their base... We also figured out what's going on! Let's get back to King Coconut first.
:'''Paimon:''' And then we can explain everything that happened to Qax.
----
;(Return to the camp)
:'''Qax:''' Welcome back!
:'''Qax:''' I guess you're going to collect some cooking ingredients and get breakfast ready.
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has not been completed)
::{{DIcon}} I picked up a few random fish... Do they count?
::{{DIcon}} Actually, we were going to do a little pre-breakfast workout.
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has been completed)
::{{DIcon}} I picked up a few random fish... Do they count?
::{{DIcon}} Actually, we ended up taking care of some old foes.
:'''Paimon:''' Did you bring the vet by already? That was super quick!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehrrr?
:'''"King Coconut":''' Hrroo, mrroo!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks as though King Coconut's made good progress &mdash; he's even able to stand up already. Nice!
:'''Paimon:''' Still, where's that vet?
:'''Qax:''' I didn't see any of you when I brought him here, so I took him to treat King Coconut first.
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has not been completed)
::'''Qax:''' He assessed that King Coconut was hit by a rock flying at high speed and suffered internal bruising... I can't put two and two together, though. There weren't any loose rocks around the spot where King Coconut collapsed.
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has been completed)
::'''Qax:''' He assessed that King Coconut was hit by a rock flying at high speed and suffered internal injuries... I can't put two and two together, though. There weren't any loose rocks around the spot where King Coconut collapsed.
:'''Qax:''' Luckily, the vet is experienced in dealing with this kind of injury, so he had a special medicine ready to treat King Coconut's internal bruising and greatly relieve the pain...
:'''Qax:''' Now that King Coconut can walk slowly, we can take him to the vet for more comprehensive treatment.
:'''Qax:''' We found another Qucusaurus near the camp bearing similar injuries &mdash; a lost Saurian companion from the Flower-Feather Clan, apparently.
:'''Qax:''' After treating it, the vet took it back to the tribe.
:'''Paimon:''' A "rock flying at high speed"... Would that be those frangible rounds that the Saurian poachers were talking about?
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, Paimon's getting peeved now...
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has not been completed)
::{{Black Screen|You and Paimon tell Qax the whole story...}}
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has been completed)
::{{Black Screen|You and Paimon tell Qax the whole story, plus its connections to your previous animal rescue...}}
:'''Qax:''' So, King Coconut was ambushed by those criminals, leading to those internal injuries... Good thing I came back early, or the consequences would've been too dreadful to contemplate!
:'''Qax:''' Those scum! I've a mind to give them a punch or two...
:'''Qax:''' No, that's too few. Let them pay it off in installments: Two thousand punches for every victim who had their Saurian companion kidnapped!
:'''"King Coconut":''' Awrrrh!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's true! Had we known, we would've tied a few of them up and brought them over to you and King Coconut. Might do you some good to give them a thorough drubbing and let off a little steam.
:'''Qax:''' Anyway, let's put venting to one side for now...
:'''Qax:''' So the two of you wiped out this criminal syndicate in the time it takes to make breakfast? That's beyond incredible!
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has not been completed)
::{{DIcon}} They haven't been wiped out completely just yet.
::{{DIcon}} There are still vestiges of that gang remaining.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. Their boss took off super quick and has probably made it to another of their bases...
::'''Paimon:''' We won't show her a lick of mercy next time!
;(If [[Friends of Fire and Water]] has been completed)
::{{DIcon}} We should've rooted them all out this time.
::{{DIcon}} But still, we should be wary of any who might remain.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. We might have taken their boss out this time, but there might still be more bad guys waiting to claim the top spot and rebuild in secret...
::'''Paimon:''' So we can't let our guard down!
:'''Qax:''' If that's the case, King Coconut and I will warn the Flower-Feather Clan patrol crews to keep vigilant and watch out for this criminal syndicate once we get back there.
:'''Qax:''' The campsite we built can be kept to serve as a rest area for their patrols, and we can use a bulletin board to warn passersby and help them avoid further ambushes.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, having the patrols spend more time in this area would help deter any bad guys. That's a real sensible suggestion, Qax!
:'''Qax:''' Please hold on a second while I get this bulletin board set up...
:{{Black Screen|Qax takes the remaining wood and effortlessly makes a standard bulletin board, using a spray paint can to create a rather conspicuous image...}}
:'''Qax:''' Voila! All done!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''"King Coconut":''' Hrrrh~
:'''Paimon:''' This bulletin board... Huh, is that us and {{Little One}}?
:{{DIcon}} Excellent likenesses.
::'''Qax:''' Thanks for the compliment. Time is of the essence, so I didn't get too hung up on the details...
:{{DIcon}} Could you make us look cooler?
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, don't be so demanding. Paimon thinks this style's real heart-warming!
:'''Qax:''' I'll try to draw a more formal poster for you two later, both in commemoration of your efforts in fighting the syndicate, but also to remind all of us what you look like.
:'''Paimon:''' In any case, this will be... The first base for the campaign against this syndicate of Saurian traffickers. We can come over and check things out if we find the time.
:'''Paimon:''' Hopefully, this place &mdash; no, all of Natlan &mdash; will be free of these gangs trafficking stolen Saurians and other animals!
;(Quest completes)

;(Read the bulletin board, optional)
:'''Read:''' "For those who just happen to be passing through, or if you've been active in this area for a long while: Eyes up, and stay sharp."
:'''Read:''' "There was a cunning criminal syndicate operating in this area who would use weapons that leave no trace to harm people's Saurian companions, then capture them and sell them off for a profit!"
:{{DIcon}} Read
::'''Read:''' "Fortunately, the brave and resourceful {{Traveler}}, {{MC|m=his|f=her}} companion Paimon, and {{Little One}} acted decisively..."
::'''Read:''' "They dealt a heavy blow to this syndicate, and rescued many of the captured animals!"
::{{DIcon}} Read
:::'''Read:''' "However, it is unclear if these villains still have accomplices at large, or when they will come out of the woodwork once again..."
:::'''Read:''' "Soon after, each tribe will take turns sending out patrols to keep the peace in this area, continue tracking down clues about said syndicate, and do their best to thoroughly wipe them out."
:::{{DIcon}} Read
::::'''Read:''' "As such, friends, please refrain from resting out in the open. It's safest if you go inside a camp &mdash; and more comfortable, too!"
