'''Prospect of the Brave''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Brave Heart]].

==Description==
To comfort his crybaby of a companion, the young hero gave his friend a bird's feather.<br />This was proof of their shared adventure, of the treasure they found together, and was meant to embolden his comrade.

Much later, one of them was named a "lion,"<br />And became a crownless king at the head of many knights.<br />The other became a "wolf,"<br />Supporting his friend from the shadows, and running affairs of state.

In those turbulent times, the two defended their home and each other like sword and dagger.<br />But this was a story from long ago.<br />So many were lost during the [[cataclysm]].
