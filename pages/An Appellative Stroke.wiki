==Trivia==
* It is possible to have two copies of An Appellative Stroke in the [[Inventory]] at the same time, as the [[Mail/"Eons Adrift" Wanderer (Anemo) Name Reset Notice|"Eons Adrift" Wanderer (Anemo) Name Reset Notice]] contains An Appellative Stroke as an attachment regardless of whether or not the player has already used the one they received from ''As Though Morning Dew''. However, it is ''not'' recommended to give the Wanderer a name that violates the Rules and Disclaimers for Name Modification in order to do this.
** Due to the [[Version 3.7#Post-patch Optimization & Fixes|erroneous resetting]] of the names given to some players' Wanderers and the additional copy of this item included in the [[Mail/Compensation for Abnormal Resetting of Wanderer's Name|Compensation for Abnormal Resetting of Wanderer's Name]], players who named their Wanderer during ''As Though Morning Dew'' with a name that was erroneously reset and who did not use either copy of An Appellative Stroke may have three copies of the item in their Inventory at the same time.
