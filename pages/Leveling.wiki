'''Leveling''' allows the player to level up their [[Character]]s, [[Weapon]]s, and [[Artifact]]s using the corresponding [[Experience]] and [[Item]]s. Characters and Weapons require Ascension to further level up at once it reaches certain levels.

==Characters==
{{Main|Character}}
Characters require {{Item|Character EXP}} to level up their level, which can be obtained from [[Character EXP Material]]s and defeating [[Monsters]] in the [[open world]]. When they reach a certain level, they must be ascended to the next [[Ascension Phase]] with [[Character Level-Up Material|Level-Up Materials]], [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material|Enhancement Materials]], and [[Local Specialties]] before they can be level up further.

Leveling also applies to character [[Combat Talent]]s, which require [[Character Talent Material|Talent]], [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material|Enhancement]], and [[Character Level-Up Material|Level-Up Materials]].

==Weapons==
{{Main|Weapon}}
Weapons require [[Weapon EXP]] to enhance their level, which can be obtained from [[Weapon Enhancement Material]]s and other Weapons. When they reach a certain level, they must be ascended to the next [[Ascension Phase]] with [[Weapon Ascension Material|Ascension]] and [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material|Enhancement Materials]] before they can be level up further.

Weapons can have their [[Refinement Rank]] increased by refining using a duplicate Weapon or their unique [[Refinement Material]].

==Artifacts==
{{Main|Artifact}}
Artifacts require [[Artifact EXP]] to enhance their level, which can be obtained from [[Artifact Enhancement Material]]s and other Artifacts.
