==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing ''Transient Dreams'')
:'''Yuzu:''' Hello! I heard from [[Furuya Noboru]] that you're an adventurer from afar. Oh, I'm so jealous... If only I could go on an adventure as well...
:'''Yuzu:''' Oh well... If it isn't too much trouble, could you tell me some stories about the outside world?
:{{DIcon}} You could take on some commissions from the Adventurers' Guild.
::'''Yuzu:''' You think I've never gone there before? Don't judge me by my age! I've completed the assignments from the guild at least once, twice... or three times!
::'''Yuzu:''' But because of the Sakoku Decree, they were all exclusively local assignments...
::'''Yuzu:''' I once told one of the higher-ups in the guild about this, but he just kicked the can down the road, making excuses like "there are many treasures in Inazuma too" and such.
::'''Yuzu:''' When I kept pushing, he just referred me to the Shogunate instead of the Guild.
::'''Yuzu:''' Hmph, this stupid Sakoku Decree has caused us, the adventurers of Inazuma, to be confined to such a limited space! I doubt that even the Almighty Shogun can pay the toll for getting in the way of my future adventuring career!
::'''Yuzu:''' ...Ah, Electro Archon have mercy. Electro Archon have mercy. You didn't hear me say anything at all...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I didn't hear anything.
:::'''Yuzu:''' Wah... Thank you...
:::'''Yuzu:''' *sigh* I wish I was a traveler like you. I want to go to the neighboring Liyue or even Mondstadt...
:::'''Yuzu:''' I heard that the people in Mondstadt are carefree and live as they please. When will I be able to experience something like that...
::;(Obtain [[Guide to Freedom]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Furuya Noboru's intel is actually pretty good.
::'''Yuzu:''' About him... if it weren't for me pushing hard on the issues about the Sakoku Decree, I wouldn't even have realized that he was a senior member of the Adventurers' Guild.
::'''Yuzu:''' But while he seems to be weak and unfit, he is actually a very seasoned adventurer. I've heard that many adventurers in the guild go to him for advice.
:;(Before completing [[The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna]])
:::'''Yuzu:''' He is not a bad fellow. But if only he could help me get out of Inazuma...
:;(After completing The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna)
:::'''Yuzu:''' He's not a bad person, but I just wish he'd let me go off to more places for adventure. I mean, we can't leave the country, sure, but couldn't we at least go to some mysterious place like Tsurumi Island?
:::'''Yuzu:''' It was covered in fog before, so I get that it wasn't allowed. But now that the fog's gone, he should just let us go!
:::'''Yuzu:''' But he's always like, "oh, new people should learn from the basics" this, and "don't just go after short-term gains recklessly" that...
:::'''Yuzu:''' He's so droll!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yuzu:''' Bye! And by the way, could you bring me along in secret when you leave Inazuma?

;(After completing ''[[Transient Dreams]]'')
:'''Yuzu:''' Hello! I heard from Furuya Noboru that you're an adventurer from afar.
:'''Yuzu:''' I mean, I'm getting read for something of an overseas adventure myself, you know?
:'''Yuzu:''' So, uh... If it isn't too much trouble, could you tell me some stories about your journeys?
:{{DIcon}} You'll need a sword.
::'''Yuzu:''' Eh? Does it really have to be a sword? I would have thought that a knife might be easier to use when surviving out in the wild.
::'''Yuzu:''' Oh, you mean mining? Hmm, that's true. An experienced adventurer should always bring materials with which to repair their tools!
::'''Yuzu:''' Looks like I'll need to make a trip to the blacksmith. Hold on, let me write this down on my list...
:{{DIcon}} You need to fish for a Paimon.
::'''Yuzu:''' Eh? What's a Paimon?
::'''Yuzu:''' Oh, you mean a guide... Hmm, that might be tough. Inazuma's been closed for so long, I haven't had the opportunity to make any friends from other lands...
::'''Yuzu:''' I doubt the people at the Adventurers' Guild will be much help there either. Why, I was just spinning my wheels here this entire time, and if it were up to them, I would keep doing that!
::'''Yuzu:''' But now that I'm free, I'm going to get prepped, and then I'll take my first step toward being a great adventurer!
:{{DIcon}} Furuya Noboru's intel is actually pretty good.
::'''Yuzu:''' About him... if it weren't for me pushing hard on the issues about the Sakoku Decree back then, I wouldn't even have realized that he was a senior member of the Adventurers' Guild.
::'''Yuzu:''' But while he seems to be weak and unfit, he is actually a very seasoned adventurer. I've heard that many adventurers in the guild go to him for advice.
:;(Before completing The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna)
<!-- Got this alternative dialogue without completing The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna -->
:::'''Yuzu:''' He is not a bad fellow. But he's been of little help when it comes to heading overseas.
:;(After completing The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna)
:::'''Yuzu:''' He's not a bad person, but I wish he'd help me out more in my attempts to leave the country. I mean, couldn't we at least go to some mysterious place like Tsurumi Island?
:::'''Yuzu:''' It was covered in fog before, so I get that it wasn't allowed. But now that the fog's gone, he should just let us go!
:::'''Yuzu:''' But he's always like, "oh, new people should learn from the basics" this, and "don't just go after short-term gains recklessly" that...
:::'''Yuzu:''' He's so droll!
:{{DIcon|Reward}} You might need to prepare a boat armed with a cannon.
:;(If Guide to Freedom is not yet obtained)
<!-- Obtained Guide to Freedom before Transient Dreams and this option didn't show up -->
::'''Yuzu:''' Oh, is that how it is? I get it, then!
::'''Yuzu:''' Huh... You're such a nice person...
::'''Yuzu:''' Looks like I still have a lot more to prepare. I wish I could go to Liyue across the sea or perhaps Mondstadt, even further away, sometime soon...
::'''Yuzu:''' I've heard that the people in Mondstadt are carefree and live as they please. When will I be able to experience something like that...
:;(Obtain [[Guide to Freedom]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yuzu:''' See you! Just you wait - I'll become a continent-trotting adventurer one day!
