:{{DIcon}} An adeptus?
::'''Little Luo:''' One day, when I was in the forest, I met a handsome, dashing adeptus &mdash; it was as if he had popped right out of a story book!
::'''Little Luo:''' I smiled at him, but he didn't smile back.
::'''Little Luo:''' He just returned the doll that the hilichurls stole back to me... Do you think he doesn't like me, by any chance?
::{{DIcon}} Maybe?
:::'''Little Luo:''' That... That's sad...
:::'''Little Luo:''' How do I get him to like me? ...Oh, I've never had this problem before...
::{{DIcon}} I'd say he actually likes you.
:::'''Little Luo:''' Really?
:::'''Little Luo:''' ...I did think about it as well, does he just not like smiling?
:::'''Little Luo:''' If I see him again, I'll definitely find a way to make him smile.
:{{DIcon}} Stay safe, then.
