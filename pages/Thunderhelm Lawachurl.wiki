==Strategy==
Its base stats are 50% Physical [[Resistance]], 70% Electro Resistance, and 10% Elemental Resistance to all other elements. The Thunderhelm Lawachurl's armor can be broken more easily with {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, and {{Dendro}}.

The armor grant the Lawachurl stronger attacks, but does not reduce DMG taken. See [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]] for more info on enemy elemental shields.

When the The Lawachurl performs '''Upa Shato''', the player should either avoid dodging towards the back of the Lawachurl, or prepare for a follow-up attack in the form of '''Surprise Dash''' if the Lawachurl uses '''Thunder Berserker'''.
