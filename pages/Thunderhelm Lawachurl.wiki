==Strategy==
Its base stats are 50% Physical [[Resistance]], 70% Electro Resistance, and 10% Elemental Resistance to all other elements. The Thunderhelm Lawachurl's armor can be broken more easily with {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, and {{Dendro}}.

The armor grant the Lawachurl stronger attacks, but does not reduce DMG taken. See [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]] for more info on enemy elemental shields.

When the The Lawachurl performs '''Jumping Slam''', the player should either avoid dodging towards the back of the Lawachurl, or prepare for a follow-up attack in the form of '''Surprise Dash''' if the Lawachurl uses '''Thunder Berserker'''.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A mysterious "lord" of hilichurls that strides through the thunderstorm.<br />This huge hilichurl is referred to as "Lawa" by its brethren. Its giant body is saturated with Electro energy, while the Elemental Energy seeps through the cracks in its body in the form of Electro Crystal growths.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
*The Thunderhelm Lawachurl north of the [[Pyro Hypostasis]] has the title "Storm-Sealed Lawachurl" when fought. The other Thunderhelm Lawachurls scattered elsewhere do not have any title.
*If '''Slime Throw''' is used when the Thunderhelm Lawachurl is not in its '''Electro Infused State''', the slime can appear as a Small [[Mutant Electro Slime]]. There are no Small Mutant Electro Slimes anywhere else in the game and this is its only appearance.
