==Abilities and Attacks==
* '''Punches:''' Roars and performs a punch with its left arm. It occasionally combos with both arms and slams the ground, dealing '''75% ATK''' and '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Electro Enhanced State:''' Generates an {{Electro}} shield, granting itself more powerful attacks. This shield will degrade over 90 seconds and can be further damaged using [[Elemental Reactions]]. {{Pyro}} and {{Cryo}} are most effective against the shield.

* '''Dash:''' Quickly charges at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} to players in its path. This attack is only performed when the Thunderhelm Lawachurl is in the '''Electro Enhanced State'''.

* '''Charged Dash:''' Quickly charges at the player after charging, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} to players in its path. This attack is only performed when the Thunderhelm Lawachurl is in the '''Electro Enhanced State'''.

* '''Charged Punch:''' Charges and swings its fist at the player with great force, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Thunderhelm Lawachurl is in the '''Electro Enhanced State'''.

* '''Shockwave:''' Roars and slams both hands into the ground twice, creating a shockwave and dealing '''100% ATK''' and '''125% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} with each slam. This attack is only performed when the Thunderhelm Lawachurl is in the '''Electro Enhanced State'''.

* '''Jumping Slam:''' Roars and jumps into the air, slamming down at the player's position, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Thunderhelm Lawachurl is in the '''Electro Enhanced State'''.

* '''Surprise Dash:''' The Thunderhelm Lawachurl suddenly charges at its target without any warning signs, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. This attack is performed as a follow-up to '''Jumping Slam''' if the player is behind the Lawachurl after said attack. This attack is only performed when the Thunderhelm Lawachurl is in the '''Electro Enhanced State'''.

* '''Slime Throw:''' If the player is at a higher elevation or too far away, the Lawachurl will roar and grab a [[Large Electro Slime]] or [[Mutant Electro Slime]] from the ground, throwing it at the player, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. If a Mutant Electro Slime is thrown, it will cause three subsequent explosions after the main one, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Thunderhelm Lawachurl is in the '''Electro Enhanced State'''.

* '''Electro Shards:''' While in the Electro Enhanced State, the Thunderhelm Lawachurl's attacks will leave Electro shards on the ground. These shards can be destroyed by Elemental Reactions and [[Blunt Attack|heavy attack]]s, and are particularly vulnerable to Pyro and Cryo attacks. If not destroyed after a certain period of time, the shards will explode, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

==Strategy==
Its base stats are 50% Physical [[Resistance]], 70% Electro Resistance, and 10% Elemental Resistance to all other elements. The Thunderhelm Lawachurl's armor can be broken more easily with {{Cryo}} and {{Pyro}}.

The armor will reduce the damage done to the Lawachurl but will not completely block it. See [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]] for more info on enemy elemental shields.

When the The Lawachurl performs '''Jumping Slam''', the player should either avoid dodging towards the back of the Lawachurl, or prepare for a follow-up attack in the form of '''Surprise Dash'''.
