:'''Siger:''' Financial compensation... That's all they can offer!
:'''Siger:''' Is this something that can be solved through paying money?
:{{DIcon}} What's going on?
::'''Siger:''' I came all the way from Fontaine to have a serious and rigorous academic discussion with the researchers about the ancient books in my collection.
::'''Siger:''' But as soon as my feet touched the shore, I was swarmed by researchers who made a huge mess of my books.
::'''Siger:''' They said it was out of love for knowledge, but I saw that they were all port staff, and no one was reading the books earnestly!
::'''Siger:''' They were flipping carelessly through my books while muttering, "no need to bother the great [[matra]] with these"...
::'''Siger:''' My books are rare antiques! How dare they call them "these"? This is an outrage!
::'''Siger:''' My books have now been devalued, and all they did was compensate me with money! How could I not be angry at them?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Siger:''' Argh, I'm so mad!
