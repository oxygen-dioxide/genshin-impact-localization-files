|text      = Just now, I found myself counting the years, thinking back on how many birthdays it's been since we first met...

Time really flies, huh? I still remember this time last year, when I was writing how I hoped you wouldn't run into any legal troubles in [[Fontaine]], as clearly as if it were yesterday. Who'd have thought that the next time I wrote to you, you'd be on the cusp of setting off for [[Natlan]]...

Oh, and by the way, that report in [[The Steambird]] was a real nail-biter! I'm just glad you managed to solve the case so perfectly in the end. Even as a legal expert, I take my hat off to you &mdash; that sure was brilliant!

It was just a shame that the article glossed over all the juicy legal details. Actually, umm, I wanted to ask... as one of the concerned parties, would you be able to elaborate on the ins and outs of how the trial went? I'd even consider it your birthday gift for me. How about that?

Of course, aside from legal agreements, "contracts" made through friendly favors should be abided by too. After all, courtesy demands reciprocity. So, as a gesture of my sincerity, please accept the return gift I've enclosed with this letter. This one's on me!
