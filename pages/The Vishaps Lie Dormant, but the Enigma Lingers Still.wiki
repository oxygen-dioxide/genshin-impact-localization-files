==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|After a sustained effort, you seem to have scared the [[Geovishap]]s into submission and the disturbances across the land seem to have subsided. However, the reason for their re-emergence and rampage remains a mystery...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Katheryne)
:'''Katheryne:''' Adventurer, thanks to your hard work, the Geovishap investigation can be brought to a close.
:{{DIcon}} So, we're finally done...
::'''Katheryne:''' Thank you for alleviating the pressure on the Guild.
:{{DIcon}} Aw, I was just getting started.
::'''Katheryne:''' Haha, it seems like you enjoyed yourself, then. That's wonderful.
:'''Katheryne:''' All the adventurers who took leave to visit their families have now returned and reported in at the Guild. You have already made a great contribution, so please, leave the remaining work to us.
:'''Katheryne:''' As for why these ancient creatures suddenly began appearing, we will continue to investigate.
:'''Katheryne:''' Oh, and don't forget to claim your investigation rewards.
:'''Katheryne:''' The Adventurers' Guild looks forward to your continued excellence! Ad astra abyssosque!
