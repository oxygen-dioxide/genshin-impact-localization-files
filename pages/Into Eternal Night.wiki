==Gameplay Notes==
* During step 6, a trial [[Kachina]] joins the party.
* During step 8, the active party is limited to a trial [[Mualani]] and [[Kachina]].
* During step 10, the active character will be restricted to the Traveler.
** The Abyssal energy visual effect at the edges of the screen is an indicator of how close the player is to escaping, not how close the Abyssal wall is.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continues from previous quest)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you don't have to drag Paimon. You're pulling too hard!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Looks like we made it. This is the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' It looks so different from what I imagined in the stories.
:{{DIcon}} There's [[Abyss]]al energy everywhere...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That overflow of energy is probably what trapped Kachina here in the first place.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' From this point forward, everything we know about the real world no longer applies. Anything can happen here.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's more worried about how we're gonna make it out... We obviously can't go back the way we came.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Do you see that patch of light on the ground? It's shining down from that fissure in the sky.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah, right in front of us. So, that's coming from up there... Whoa, it's so high up! Did we really fall that far down!?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Just like I said &mdash; our real-world knowledge doesn't apply here. We fell all this way, yet came out completely unscathed.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' If this was the real world, we'd have to climb our way back up to the entrance. But, here, all we have to do is stand underneath the light and offer a prayer.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That's it?
:{{DIcon}} Don't try it now.
::{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right, right... We've still got a job to do.
:{{DIcon}} Don't try to run away.
::{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You really think that little of Paimon? That's not even why Paimon asked!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So that means all we need to do is find Kachina and bring her to this location.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Exactly. This light is streaming in from the real world. It's a link between the two realms.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hmm, the terrain looks difficult to navigate, and the visibility's not great, either. How are we supposed to find Kachina in these conditions?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, these floating black things don't look super friendly, either.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Those are all manifestations of Abyssal power. Be careful.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' G&mdash;Ghost! A talking ghost!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Calm down, I'm here to help. You're the ones who helped [[Vichama]], right?
:{{DIcon}} Wait, does that mean you're...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 03.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Yes. I'm Vichama's friend, Mallko. I was completely lost to this realm until I sensed a mysterious power calling out to me.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 04.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' It's like it was seeking me out, attempting to reassemble the pieces of who I used to be. Of course, it could only do so much...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 05.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' I'm sorry I can only appear before you in this imperfect form.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' No, we should be the ones apologizing. If the Spiritspeaker Stone hadn't become corrupted by the Abyss, we could've done much more.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' But, we had to destroy it, otherwise Vichama and his tribe would have been in danger.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 06.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Of course. Thank you for protecting him. I never imagined that, even after all these years, he'd still take such a risk for me...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 07.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Under the power of the Stone, it felt like our souls were connected.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 08.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Turns out even our regrets were exactly the same...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Whether in triumph or death, you want your best friend by your side.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 09.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Exactly. That may not be in the cards for us, but... It's not too late for you.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 10.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' You're looking for a young girl from the [[Children of Echoes]], right? She's being chased by an embodiment of Abyssal power.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 11.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' I'd like to help her while I'm still in this form, so follow me.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 12.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Be careful. This place has been severely corroded by the Abyss.
{{Dialogue End}}

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't realize it had gotten this bad...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' It's like a seething volcano ready to engulf our world at any moment.

;(If the player is hit by a manifestation of Abyssal power for the first time)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ouch...!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 14.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Quick, get back here. You can't go wandering off, it's too dangerous!

;(While following Mallko)
:;(Mallko forms a shield)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 13.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Stick close to me. My power will be able to ward off attacks for the time being.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 15.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' We won't be able to keep this up. Let's try another route. This way.
:;(Mallko's shield disappears)

;(Approach Mallko in the area at the side)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 16.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Not good... More monsters...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We shouldn't waste our time on them.

;(Follow Mallko after defeating the monsters)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Paimon can't see anything...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 17.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' It's easy to get lost here. Just stick close.

;(Follow Mallko to the open area)
:;(Many floating black manifestations of Abyssal power surround the Traveler, who appears to be completely alone)
:;(The Traveler gets ready to fight, then suddenly the manifestations all vanish)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' D&mdash;Did you hear that?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' What!?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Never mind... It was probably just my imagination.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't scare Paimon like that!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I heard it too. It was a voice from the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eek!? W&mdash;What did it say?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Doesn't matter. It certainly doesn't harbor good intentions.

;(Follow Mallko)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 whisper 01.ogg}} '''Whisper:''' Journey... Lies...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahhh, Paimon just heard it too!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's keep going! Paimon wants to get out of this place!

;(Approach northeast instead of following Mallko northwest, optional)<!--1 tepetlisaur; 2 koholasaurs-->
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 18.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Hey, wrong way! Get back here!

;(Defeat the enemies on the path northeast until it crosses Mallko's path, optional)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mallko 19.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Wow, I'm impressed. You're an extremely skilled group of adventurers.

;(Approach Kachina)
:;(Rifthounds appear, then disappear, then many floating black manifestations of Abyssal power surround Kachina from her point of view)
:;(Kachina runs and falls, and the manifestations close in on her)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We're here, Kachina!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Mualani!? You made it!
;(Behind Kachina, there are Rifthounds but no manifestations)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Looks like our reunion will have to wait until we take care of these monsters!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 6 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Good idea. Let's go!

;(After defeating the Rifthounds)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' You're here, you're finally here! *sobbing* Thank you so much...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' That monster can appear from anywhere... It almost caught me a bunch of times.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' The Wayob's power helped keep me hidden, so I just tried to stay out of sight until you got here.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Attagirl! You did so well! And most importantly, you weren't hurt!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Should we start heading back, then?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Actually, I have a request. Will you come visit the Wayob with me?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I can't exactly put it into words, but something's wrong with the [[Ode of Resurrection]], and I know it has something to do with the contamination from the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That was the [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]]'s theory as well. Everything we've seen here certainly seems to back it up.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mallko 01.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' In the Night Kingdom, there are six main totem poles, representing the Wayob of each tribe.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mallko 02.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' You can think of them like the body of each Wayob. Additional totem poles, like the ones around here, serve as proxies to which the Wayob can extend their consciousness.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mallko 03.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' There are countless proxies scattered around the Night Kingdom. Through them, the Wayob can extend their consciousness over the entire realm and track down souls no matter where they roam.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mallko 04.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' But if a proxy were to become severely contaminated, then a soul could become lost within the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Judging by the current situation, I don't think we're dealing with just one contaminated proxy. Even if we could drive back the Abyssal power from one of them, that probably wouldn't even put a dent in the problem.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 06.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Still, we can't just leave the Wayob to suffer. It's protected me this whole time...
:{{DIcon}} Saving one is better than saving none at all.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I agree. We might even manage to draw out the monster that's been hunting Kachina.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Getting rid of the monster might help slow down the deterioration of the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 07.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Ugh, ugh... Argh...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Kachina? What's wrong?

:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe we really should leave... Kachina's already been here for too long.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 09.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' No, I... I'm fine. I don't plan on listening to that nonsense. I can hold on.
:{{DIcon}} Where's the totem pole?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 10.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Just up ahead. I'll lead the way. Besides, I can still fight, so please... help me out a little longer.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Listen to me, Kachina. We'll come with you, but that's because we want to help the Wayob, not because we have something to prove.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You don't have anything to prove, either. It's okay if you reach your limit. We'll be there for you.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Alright, the sooner we get this done the better.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We've already come all this way, so we might as well try to get to the bottom of this.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 kachina 11.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Let's go. This way.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mallko 05.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' I'll stay here and try to stall the Abyss monster.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' All by yourself!? That's too dangerous!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mallko 06.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' It's alright. I may not be as strong as that monster, but I'm definitely more familiar with the area. Besides...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mallko 07.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' I don't have much time left. If you're anything like my friend, I'm sure you're not particularly fond of goodbyes.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 mallko 08.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' So, go. Achieve your goal, and return to the world where you belong.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 7 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Thank you for everything.

:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Wayob? Wayob! I'm back! My friends and I are here to heal you!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Wayob! Can you hear me? Wayob!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 wayob 01.ogg}} '''{{tt|"The Great Spirit of This Land"|Agent of Night's Will}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So, we were right. The contamination is already too severe. It's preventing the Wayob from answering our calls.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, get ready, everyone. Time to purge the Abyssal energy from this place.
:{{DIcon}} I'll help, too.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Careful. We've got company.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Already!?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 01.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' You really think that puny soul could slow me down... Courage in the face of futility is pure folly.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 02.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' He tried to get in my way, so I disposed of him.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You... You killed Mallko!?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 03.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' He would have dispersed with or without me. Rather than worrying about him, I would urge you to focus on yourself.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 04.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' You may have defeated others of my kind in the past, but underestimate me now, and it will be to your peril.
:{{DIcon}} Are you the one behind all of this?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 05.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' No. The power of the Abyss is intoxicating. The destruction it seeks captivates like a masterful work of art. I strive only for the opportunity to see it up close.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 06.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' I thought this naive little girl was an exception, but it turns out... humanity is full of lambs willing to offer themselves up to the slaughter.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 07.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' That is the tragedy of your short lives. You understand nothing of all-encompassing power.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 08.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' [[Ancient Name]]s? Pride? Friendship? All empty ideas invented to give you a false sense of self-worth. They possess no power at all.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 09.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' The Pyro Archon created those grandiose ideals out of pure selfishness! Anything to avoid sharing power. Anything to avoid handing over the Primordial gift to ordinary people like you.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 10.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' Don't believe me? Then ask yourself &mdash; why is the Pyro Archon strong beyond measure, while you, Kachina, remain so pathetically weak?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I... I...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Kachina.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Give me your hand.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Feel that? I'm right here next to you.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Thanks, Mualani. You're right... I have nothing to fear.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Because I'm not alone anymore.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 11.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You're right... Maybe comforting ideals don't have any power.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But, you also couldn't be more wrong. You've never had to work for your own strength, so you will never understand the true source of our power.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 comonqui 12.ogg}} '''Comonqui:''' What!?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The courage we have to stand before you and not back down... It comes from our friendship.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The power lies not in the ideal itself...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But in our commitment to upholding that ideal, and in our decision to stand together and fight!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well said!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's go, Kachina. It shouldn't take more than two of us to handle an enemy like this.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 kachina 06.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Sorry in advance, but you... you deserve what's coming to you!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 8 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' There aren't many in Natlan who can beat us when we're together. It's time he got a taste of that kind of power.

:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' We won! We actually won!
:{{DIcon}} Nice job!
:{{DIcon}} Turns out, he wasn't any stronger than the ones we've fought in the past.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That's what he gets for underestimating you two.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Fantastic work, Kachina! Absolutely fantastic!

:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It's probably a projection from the real world, but that doesn't explain why it's glowing all of a sudden...

:;(A giant shadowy figure glowing gold with the same letters as Mualani's Ancient Name glowing on his chest emerges from Mualani's Ancient Name)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 01.ogg}} '''???:''' That was a bold move... diving head first into the fire to save your friend, especially in a place so overrun with Abyssal corruption.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Still, seeing you pull it off was really something.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Everything you said was exactly right. As isolated individuals, we stand no chance against the power of the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 04.ogg}} '''???:''' It took years' worth of scars and lots of unnecessary suffering for me to understand that for myself.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 05.ogg}} '''???:''' The Pyro Archon's plan will unite us as one. Everyone has a part to play.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Only then will we have the power to defeat the strongest of foes.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Wh&mdash;Who are you...?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 07.ogg}} '''{{tt|Tupac|"Giant"}}:''' [[Tupac]], a warrior from the [[People of the Springs]]. I fought against the Abyss during the invasion five hundred years ago.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I've heard that name before! You were the "Giant" who saved all of Natlan!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 08.ogg}} '''Tupac:''' Since you were able to awaken my words from your Ancient Name, that means you've fully embodied the aspirations of the Wayob.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 09.ogg}} '''Tupac:''' Under the Name "Umoja," you shall {{Rubi|unite|Umoja}} the tribes and save Natlan from its impending doom.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' M&mdash;Me...?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 10.ogg}} '''Tupac:''' "As long as blood still runs through your veins, even the tiniest spark of steel against stone can ignite a flame."
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 11.ogg}} '''Tupac:''' "Its blaze will become one with our vision for Natlan."
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 tupac 12.ogg}} '''Tupac:''' "Even amid everlasting darkness, our bonds remain eternal."
:;(Tupac and Mualani connect their fists, then Tupac disappears)
:;(Mualani glows with the visual effects of her Nightsoul's Blessing)

:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So many memories... My brain was just flooded with everything he once knew...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So that's what happened...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you mean? Did you just figure something out?
:;(Mualani stops glowing)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Five hundred years ago, they foresaw the very crisis we're facing now. Efforts to save Natlan started all the way back then...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' We can go over the details once we get back. We shouldn't linger here longer than we have to.
:{{DIcon}} Does that mean... you already know about this whole thing?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I know bits and pieces, but I had no idea Mualani was also part of the plan.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' This sounds like something that's going to need a lot of explaining. Let's focus on saving the Wayob first.
:;(The Traveler uses their power of purification while Paimon looks on and the rest send elemental energy to the stone)
:;(The Abyssal corruption is cleared from the stone, which now glows gold)
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 kachina 06.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Okay, that should be enough! Wayob... Wayob? Can you hear me?

:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 kachina 07.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Great... Well then, I'm afraid it's time to say goodbye. I just wanted to make sure you were okay before we leave, but we can't afford to stay here any longer.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 kachina 08.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I was going to ask why you bestowed an Ancient Name upon someone like me, but it's okay...
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 kachina 09.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I'll keep searching within myself for the answer. I'll never stop trying to improve my strength. One day, I'll live up to the hero you saw in me!
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 wayob 02.ogg}} '''"The Great Spirit of This Land":''' You are already an outstanding child in my eyes, Kachina, no matter what happens.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 kachina 10.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 wayob 03.ogg}} '''"The Great Spirit of This Land":''' You are all my most beloved children. It has always been my honor to protect and nurture you.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 wayob 04.ogg}} '''"The Great Spirit of This Land":''' Your Ancient Name is just that... a name. Much like your parents chose to name you, "Kachina," I also gave you a name, but it need not define you.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 wayob 05.ogg}} '''"The Great Spirit of This Land":''' Focus on who you want to be. You are already worthy of your Name. Now, you need only devote yourself to becoming a better "you."
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 wayob 06.ogg}} '''"The Great Spirit of This Land":''' The story of your Ancient Name is for you to continue. Just like your parents, my love for you will never change... no matter what the future holds.

:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 wayob 07.ogg}} '''"The Great Spirit of This Land":''' It gladdens me to see the Pyro Archon's plan move another step towards completion, but it is time for you to leave this place. The situation here is getting worse.

:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Thank you for encouraging Kachina... It was exactly what she needed to hear.
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Wh&mdash;What's going on? An earthquake!?
:{{A|vo ntaq007 9 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' We're out of time.
