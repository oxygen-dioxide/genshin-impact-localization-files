{{Description|A mask that covers the face, hiding one's expression from others.}}
'''Mocking Mask''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Pale Flame]].

==Description==
Since the stain of my [[Khaenri'ah|compatriots']] blood cannot be cleansed, I shall become The Jester, who laughs in the face of fate.<br>Since my level of learning could not compare with the sages, I failed to earn the favor of the [[Irmin|previous ruler]].<br>So too did I fail to stop them from tearing away the veil of sin, ushering in a tide of divine wrath, destruction, and foolishness...<br>Then I shall become instead a fool, a [[Fatui|Fatuus]], and devote myself to [[Tsaritsa|Her Majesty]], who understands my pain...

My name is [[Pierro]], The Jester. Please listen to the words I have to say:

Proud Fatui comrades, I know your hearts harbor both the fires of rage and the cold of eternal winter.<br>Each one of us has borne witness to the absurd callousness of the [[Heavenly Principles|foundational principles]] of this world.<br>So, let us don our masks in mockery of the world as we go forth and rewrite the rules of destiny.
