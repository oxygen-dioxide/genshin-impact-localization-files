#Talk to [[Hanachirusato]]

==Notes==
===Well Walkthrough===
Use [[Elemental Sight]] to see chests or objects more clearly.

#There is an Exquisite Chest in front of the spot after gliding down into the well.
# Use elemental reactions (e.g. Overloaded, Superconduct, Swirl) to destroy the [[Electro Rock Pile]].
# An Electro Seelie will lead to a Common Chest at its resting place.
# While you follow the Electro Seelie, there is another Common Chest on a platform along the way.
# Jump down from where the Electro Seelie rests, and destroy the crates to reveal a passage.
# Kill the 3 Electro Slimes in the passage and get the [[Electroculus]] before the fox statue.
# Go back to the Electro Seelie and climb up the nearby ladder.
# Use the [[Thunder Sakura Bough]] to summon [[Electrograna|Electrogranum]].
# Glide down through the [[Thunder Barrier]].
# Interact with the Electro lantern in front of the huge gate to purify it with the [[Ward (A Strange Story in Konda)|Ward]].
# Go to the other Electro lanterns in a counter-clockwise order. Interact with them to set the Electro petals to the following numbers: 2, 3, 5, 4. (This lines them up like the symbol on the huge gate.)
# Interact with the first Electro lantern again to "Pray".
# Defeat the [[Ochimusha]] (Phantom Warrior Beneath the Konda Village Well).
#* This completes this quest and gives you the next quest, [[Sacrificial Offering]].
# Use the Thunder Sakura Bough between Shrines "2" and "3" to summon Electrogranum.
# Climb up and go through the Electro barrier.
# Climb up again to a cavern leading to a door. Ignore the door for now.
# Climb up 2 ladders until you get to the gate leading to the surface.
# Turn around and face the 2nd Electroculus.
# There is a Common Chest on the ledge to the right of the Electroculus.
# Go to the edge of the ledge and glide down to get the Electroculus.
# After landing back in the cavern, open the door.
# There is a Luxurious Chest, [[Old Stone Slate]], and [[Rust-Worn Key]] inside the room along with many [[Investigation]] spots.
#* Paimon has the following dialogue:
#* '''Paimon:''' Looks like there's loads of stuff at the bottom of this well!
#* '''Paimon:''' (Traveler), let's see what other treasures we can find!
# Another door in the room leads back to the area with the Electro Seelie.

===Puzzle===
This is the puzzle for Well Walkthrough, Steps 10–12. There are 5 Electro lanterns surrounding the shrine. They can be dialed to have 1-5 petals. Starting with the lantern in front of the shrine as 1, dial the other lanterns with the corresponding number of petals in the order given by the shrine emblem. When all 5 lanterns have the right number of petals, "Pray" at the first lantern to initiate the light rays and complete the puzzle.

==Dialogue==
===Meeting Hanachirusato===
{{Quest Description|A mysterious, masked shrine maiden is by the strange fox statue, seemingly with something she means to ask of you...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to ???)
:'''???:''' Excuse me, busy Traveler, but I have a favor to ask.
:'''???:''' Please, look at the Sky Kitsune Statue over there.
:'''???:''' There is a ward within it that they say can only be removed by someone who has courage, values friendship, and who is favored by the might of {{Color|buzz|Electro}}.

;(Talk to ??? again)
:'''???:''' There is a ward within it that they say can only be removed by someone who has courage, values friendship, and who is favored by the might of {{Color|buzz|Electro}}.
----
;(After obtaining the ward)
:'''???:''' I was right. You are the "Destined One."
:'''???:''' With your skills and experience... Mm, this shouldn't be a problem.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Excuse my rudeness. My name is Hanachirusato, and I am a shrine maiden.
:'''Paimon:''' Do shrine maidens usually wear masks?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...I have my reasons for that.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The village in front of you is named Konda Village, and there is a... barrier within it that needs to be lifted.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That barrier is hidden behind a certain secret. I'd like to entrust you with a little investigation, and with lifting that barrier.
:{{DIcon}} Investigation?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Yes. It may take some time and trouble, but I'm sure that you will reveal the truth in the end.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, that sounds like a lot of work. Will there be payment?
:{{DIcon}} Will there be a reward for that?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Hehe... Of course.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "To those who seek shall just reward be given in proportion to their wisdom and work."
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...That's what she used to say. So no, there is no need to worry.
:{{DIcon}} "She"?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} I see. I'll get a move on, then.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I shall be counting on you for this investigation, Destined One.
----
;(Talk to Hanachirusato again)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Greetings.
:{{DIcon}} About Konda Village...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Konda Village has a long history. In the distant past, its people were once charged with the duty of guarding a certain barrier.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' But too many things have been lost to time, and this barrier has now become something that must be removed.
:{{DIcon}} About the barrier...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' There is a barrier under Konda Village. For the sake of Narukami Island, we must lift it.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' However, the path to the barrier is shrouded in Konda Village's secrets.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' I believe that you will see through the mystery of the villagers' words and reach the place appointed by destiny, just as you did with the ward...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I wish you all the best.

;(Arrive at Konda Village)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be Konda Village.
:'''Paimon:''' Secrets... Hmm, yes, Paimon smells something suspicious!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's nose is better than a dog's...
::'''Paimon:''' How rude! Paimon was just saying the obvious.
:{{DIcon}} Well done, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe. It might look very peaceful here, but Paimon's sure that there's gotta be something dark going on.
:{{DIcon}} Really?
:'''Paimon:''' There's gotta be some secrets here! Miss [[Hanachirusato|Masked Maiden]] said so.
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, let's talk to the locals first. Maybe we can find something out...
:{{DIcon}} Find out what?
::'''Paimon:''' Hehehe, the secret that the people of Konda Village are trying to hide!
:{{DIcon}} A dark secret?
::'''Paimon:''' That's right!
{{Dialogue end}}

===The Investigation===
{{Quest Description|update|Search for a secret hidden in Konda Village. The locals may be willing to say a thing or two.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Futaba)
:'''Futaba:''' Hello, strange big (bro/sis)! What's up?
:{{DIcon}} Have you encountered anything strange lately?
:'''Futaba:''' Strange? Uh... I don't get it. What kinds of things would you consider strange?
:{{DIcon}} Anything out of the ordinary.
:{{DIcon}} Like something that is hard to explain.
:'''Futaba:''' Hmm... Hmm...
:'''Futaba:''' I know!
:'''Paimon:''' Did something come to mind?
:'''Futaba:''' There's a weirdly dressed outlander and a floating white... thing talking to me!
:{{DIcon}} That is indeed strange.
:'''Futaba:''' I know, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! You two!
:'''Futaba:''' Okay, I'll be serious. One night, it suddenly started raining very heavily. Then, I heard a strange sound outside the house that accompanied the sound of the rain.
:{{DIcon}} Strange sound?
:'''Futaba:''' Yes, it was like an intermittent clicking, clacking sound!
:'''Futaba:''' The next day, I went to check it out! Then I saw some {{Color|buzz|floating bags}} in the village gully.
:'''Futaba:''' I left them alone because I didn't know who had put them there...
:'''Futaba:''' They might have washed away by now. You can take a look along the gully!
:{{DIcon}} Were there any other clues?
:'''Futaba:''' Other than that... I can't think of any.
:'''Futaba:''' You can go ask my dad! He knows a lot of things.
:{{DIcon}} Your dad?
:'''Futaba:''' {{Color|buzz|Konda Densuke}}, the chief of Konda Village.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That old man is your dad?
:'''Futaba:''' Actually, I was adopted. He adopted me, so now I'm his daughter.
:'''Futaba:''' Oh! You can also go ask my nephew, [[Takeru]].
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a second. Nephew...?
:{{DIcon}} I see. He is the village chief's grandson.
::'''Futaba:''' That's right. {{Color|buzz|Takeru likes high places}}, so maybe he's seen something from there...
:{{DIcon}} "Nephew"?
::'''Futaba:''' My dad's grandson. I'm my father's daughter, so he's my nephew.
:'''Paimon:''' This family's pretty complicated...
:{{DIcon}} I see. Thank you.
:'''Futaba:''' Hehe. Glad that I could help!
:'''Futaba:''' *Sigh* Why isn't Takeru here yet? We were supposed to hang out today.
:'''Futaba:''' Did he go up to the roof again...?

;(If Futaba was talked to before Konda Densuke)
:'''Paimon:''' Seems... kinda helpful, but also kinda unhelpful...
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), let's keep asking around! Starting with the head of the village!

;(Talk to Futaba again)
:'''Futaba:''' Are you looking for those bags, (big sis/big bro)? {{Color|buzz|If you follow the gully}}, you might find them!
----
;(Talk to Takeru)
:'''Takeru:''' Amazing, you climbed up so easily!
:'''Takeru:''' Hmmm...? Looking at you, (mister/lady), you should be an outlander, right?
:'''Takeru:''' It's been a super long time since I've seen an outlander!
:'''Takeru:''' Well then, speak: What can Konda Takeru do for you, O outlander from afar?
:'''Paimon:''' What an arrogant little kid...
:{{DIcon}} Have you noticed anything strange lately?
:'''Takeru:''' *shh* Keep your voice down... I can tell you, but promise me you won't get scared!
:'''Takeru:''' During thunderstorms...
:'''Takeru:''' ...things get spooky around here!
:'''Takeru:''' There's a strange spooky ghost lady!
:{{DIcon}} Ooh.
:{{DIcon}} I'll say hi to her when I see her...
:'''Takeru:''' Huh, how can you be so calm after I told you something like that?
:'''Takeru:''' When I told Grandpa Densuke, he didn't believe me either. He said that I must have been mistaken...
:{{DIcon}} Any other unusual things going on?
:'''Takeru:''' I guess that would be the {{Color|buzz|broken cart}} at the entrance of the village. I wonder who left it there?
:'''Takeru:''' See, that's it over there. There are hilichurls digging at it, too!

;(Talk to Takeru again)
:'''Takeru:''' How can I convince Grandpa Densuke that there really is a ghost...
:{{DIcon}} Tell him something weird...
:'''Takeru:''' Besides the ghost? That would be {{Color|buzz|the broken cart at the entrance of the village}}!
----
;(Talk to Saimon Eri)
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Hello, youngster. Are you here to listen to this old woman's stories?
:{{DIcon}} Have you encountered anything strange lately?
:'''Saimon Eri:''' The strangest thing is how we haven't heard from [[Saimon Jirou|Jirou]] for such a long time...
:'''Saimon Eri:''' My old husband's even put up a search notice in [[Inazuma City]].
:'''Saimon Eri:''' *sigh* Jirou used to hang out with the young gangsters in the village.
:'''Saimon Eri:''' We urged him to join the army because they were together from morning to night and were always up to no good.
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Maybe the kid's broken off contact because we pushed him too hard...
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Speaking of which, it seems like I haven't seen any of those punks for a while, either.
:{{DIcon}} Anything else out of the ordinary?
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Out of the ordinary... Let's see...
:'''Saimon Eri:''' In the past, traders and tourists from various countries would disembark at [[Ritou]], and they would pass through our village on their way to Inazuma City.
:'''Saimon Eri:''' The village was always busy and we would open our doors for outlanders. But that hasn't happened for a long time. That's unusual, isn't it?
:'''Saimon Eri:''' [[Imatani Saburou|Mr. Imatani]] never worried much about the kids in the past, nor would Jirou ever have fought any war no matter who told him to. This is also very abnormal.
:'''Saimon Eri:''' And the deserted shrine at the foot of the mountain would never have fallen into disrepair in the past like it has now. I've heard that the statue of the Great Fox occasionally sheds tears. That's not normal either, is it?
:'''Saimon Eri:''' The Konda family's well is always dry, even though there is plenty of water all around. Someone locked the well up the other night, and not a soul knows who did it. This kind of thing isn't normal either, right?
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Little Takeru even said that he saw a ghostly woman during a stormy night. But who or what would haunt such a peaceful village? This too is very abnormal, yes?
:'''Saimon Eri:''' ...
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Hehehe... There are just too many strange goings-on for an old woman like me. Are these what you wanted to know?
:{{DIcon}} So, about the punks you mentioned earlier...
:'''Paimon:''' Do you know where they are, Granny?
:'''Saimon Eri:''' They're a band of troublemaking brats. They most likely went somewhere new to make trouble.
:'''Saimon Eri:''' As long as Jirou isn't influenced by them, I couldn't care less.
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Still, you just reminded me of something...
:'''Saimon Eri:''' I've heard that for a while, there was a lot of Mora scattered inside {{Color|buzz|the dry well behind the village chief's house}}.
:'''Saimon Eri:''' But a group of ronin came to the village later and took almost all of it.
:'''Saimon Eri:''' That's all I know. If you want to know more, you can go ask our village chief.

;(Talk to Saimon Eri again)
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Ah, look at this old lady, only focusing on talking about her own son...
:'''Saimon Eri:''' Well, if you're interested in what's going on, go over to {{Color|buzz|the dried-up well}} and check it out.

;(Inspect the dry well)
:'''[[Well Lock]]:''' (The dry well is locked and looks like it could be opened with the corresponding key...)
----
;(Talk to Konda Densuke)
:'''Konda Densuke:''' What can I do for you, youngster?
:{{DIcon}} You are...?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' My name is Konda Densuke, and I am the village chief.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' From the way you dress, you must be an outsi&mdash; I mean, outlander, right? It's been a long time since an outlander has come to the village.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' How can I help you? Need a place to rest your feet? Or do you need help to find your way up the mountain?
:{{DIcon}} I'm looking for a place to rest.
:{{DIcon}} I want to go up the mountain.
:'''Paimon:''' No! We're here to ask about the secret of Konda Village!
:{{DIcon}} ...Oh boy.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Secret? Konda Village doesn't have any secrets.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Although the economy isn't good these days, all the taxes that should be paid to the police station are paid regularly, regardless.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' There are only a few families in our village, all with a long history. And we know each other's roots. How could we have any secrets?
:{{DIcon}} Calm down a little...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Konda Village is simple and peaceful. There are no secrets here.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' If you're looking for secrets, why don't you just go to the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] and learn the secrets of deciphering fortune slips? Or how about you go to [[Chinju Forest]] and see if you can hear the [[Bake-Danuki|"tanuki-bayashi,"]] huh!?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Phew... Sorry, I might have overreacted.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Konda Village is a peaceful place. Youngster, are you sure you don't have the wrong village?
:'''Paimon:''' But...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' If you don't believe me, {{Color|buzz|you can look around yourself}}. I, Konda Densuke, will not stand in your way.

{{Dialogue start}}

;(After talking to Konda Densuke)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh! That village head was so tight-lipped &mdash; how annoying!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go find some villagers and collect more clues. Then we'll see what he's got to say.

;(Talk to Konda Densuke again)
:'''Konda Densuke:''' I've told you, there's nothing wrong here.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' If you don't believe me, just check it out for yourself.
----
;(Talk to Konda Densuke again after collecting 1 or 2 pieces of evidence)
:'''Konda Densuke:''' *sigh* You again...
:{{DIcon}} The villagers have told us everything...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' They did? What did they say?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Don't you think you can fool an old man like me with these baseless accusations...

;(Obtain [[Cargo Bag Fished Out From Water]])

;(Investigate the broken cart at the village entrance after talking to Takeru<sup>[verification needed]</sup>)<!-- is this available before the "Look for clues" step? it's probably not available before talking to Takeru -->
:'''Paimon:''' This must be the broken cart Takeru mentioned!
:'''Paimon:''' But other than some tattered paper, Paimon doesn't see anything special here.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's see... The contents of this piece of paper are... a [[Shogunate]] ledger of goods and payments...
:'''Paimon:''' The goods are... "this book" blah blah blah... "participating in" blah blah... and the number is something-something volumes?
:'''Paimon:''' It says "volumes," which must refer to things made of paper, right?

:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? There seems to be something here...
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! It's a marked coin pouch!
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), are you thinking what Paimon's thinking?
:{{DIcon}} What's on your mind?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's thinking about buying lots and lots of snacks with this Mora!
:{{DIcon}} I'm thinking that there shouldn't be a coin pouch here.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! You mean that we should make it disappear, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Just kidding. Hmm, a coin pouch by the well... That means...
:{{DIcon}} Someone is hiding something.
:'''Paimon:''' ...And this well's in the village chief's yard.
;(Obtain [[Purse By the Dried-Up Well]])

;(After collecting all three pieces of evidence)
:'''Paimon:''' We've investigated all the suspicious places the villagers told us about, and we've found our fair share of weird stuff.

;(Talk to Konda Densuke)
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Well then. What can I do for you, youngster?
:{{DIcon}} We found the evidence.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Evidence? What evidence? I don't understand what you mean.
:'''Paimon:''' Evidence about the strange incidents in the village. Please stop pretending.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Nonsense! What kind of strange incidents could possibly happen in our village? Well, alright then, show me!
:'''Paimon:''' (Hey (Traveler), start with what was found near the well. Paimon's leaving it to you!)
:{{DIcon}} This was found at the dry well in your backyard.

:'''Konda Densuke:''' What is this? I can't read it.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Don't you try to fool me with some random things, youngster!

:'''Konda Densuke:''' A bag for carrying Mora?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' This...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' ...This belongs to our family. There is nothing suspicious about it. That's right, it's very normal!
:'''Paimon:''' He's so suspicious! Something's definitely off!
:{{DIcon}} Now then, please draw the marking that was on it.
:{{DIcon}} Please tell me how much Mora there was inside.
::'''Konda Densuke:''' Hahaha, what kind of question is that?
::'''Konda Densuke:''' There's no way you would know how much Mora was in there without opening it up either, right?
::{{DIcon}} Now then, please draw the marking that was on it.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' ...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Fine. This is indeed not my coin pouch.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' So many people have passed by my backyard, it's pretty normal for someone to have dropped it, right?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' It's...
:{{DIcon}} What's going on?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' *sigh* Aye, you've seen through me, alright. Now, I was really tempted to take the coin pouch for myself, you know?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Oh Densuke, how could an old man like you have such mischievous thoughts!
:{{DIcon}} Something's off here.
:{{DIcon}} You're hiding something else.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' I&mdash;I already admitted my desire to steal the Mora. What else could be the problem?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Come now, I will surrender this coin pouch to the Shogunate.
:'''Paimon:''' Something doesn't feel right here...
:{{DIcon}} Someone discarded this coin pouch intentionally.
:{{DIcon}} You must be overthinking things, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' (That can't be right! (Traveler), was Grandpa Densuke really just after the Mora?)
::'''Paimon:''' (He must be hiding something else, right?)
::{{DIcon}} Someone discarded this coin pouch intentionally.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Wh&mdash;What proof do you have for saying this?
:'''Paimon:''' The coin pouch is just one part of the mystery. We also found...
:'''Paimon:''' ...Found what? Hmm, your turn now, (Traveler)!
:'''Paimon:''' ((Traveler), what did we find in the gully earlier... ?)

::'''Konda Densuke:''' How could that be... You'll get nowhere, testing me like that.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' How can you prove that these two items are related?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, they're related alright.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Ridiculous! How can that be?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Unless... there's some kind of secret code on the Mora?
:'''Paimon:''' There's nothing on the Mora, but we did find something elsewhere.

:'''Paimon:''' Hey now, you finally admitted it!
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Since you have already gotten this far in your investigation, there's nothing for it. I can't hide it anymore.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' In that case, you should have a pretty good idea of what happened.
:'''Paimon:''' A very good idea indeed! Grandpa Densuke, you...
:'''Paimon:''' Tried to rob a Shogunate cart, didn't you? And in the midst of the struggle, you destroyed the cart with a single punch, causing the goods to go flying into the gully.
:'''Paimon:''' Hoping to save themselves, the Shogunate's people threw their coin pouches into the well to distract you! And then, you locked the well up to prevent others from stealing the Mora!
:'''Paimon:''' Is that right?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Ah? No, that's not what happened at all!
:'''Paimon:''' Really? Paimon was gonna ask for your key and to have that Mora at the bottom of the well...
:'''Paimon:''' ...Surrendered to the Shogunate! That's right! They were definitely going to be surrendered to the Shogunate!
:'''Konda Densuke:''' *sigh* Well, this is what actually happened...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' There was originally a group of young people in the village who got too bold after getting drunk, and actually robbed one of the Shogunate's cargo carts. These goods and the bag both belong to the Shogunate.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' I couldn't let others know that this shameful incident occurred in our village. That's why I tried to cover it up.
:'''Paimon:''' What about your confession regarding the coin pouch...
:{{DIcon}} He did that to cover up the truth.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' That's right. I thought that you would stop the investigation once I confessed.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' If it was just me... As long as no one else was affected...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Please don't report this to the Shogunate. This isn't about me saving face. I just don't want the entire village to be dragged down in the process.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not interested in reporting you.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's not why we came here!
::'''Konda Densuke:''' Oh, thank goodness! Thank goodness...
:{{DIcon}} I just want to know the truth...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, we didn't come here to report you!
::'''Konda Densuke:''' The truth? Hehe... You young people these days are so interesting.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' My conscience kept bothering me because of this cover-up, so I recorded everything in a diary.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' I threw the diary onto the roof. If you really want to read it, help yourself, but please don't ruin my recently renovated roof.
:{{DIcon}} About the lock on the well...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Yes, it was me who locked the well up. I also wrote down where I hid the key. Go read for yourself.
:'''Paimon:'''  Grandpa Densuke, do you know anything about the Konda Village barrier?
:'''Konda Densuke:''' Barrier? Oh, so people still know about that old legend...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' They say that in ancient times, underneath the ground we are standing on right now, lay the roots of the [[Thunder Sakura]]. Indeed, this was one of the five roots that protect the peace on Narukami Island.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' And guarding it and its barrier was said to be a responsibility assigned to us, the [[Konda Clan]], by the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] herself.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' But this was a long, long time ago. I hardly recall anything about the details.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|According to the village chief Densuke, he threw the notebook recording the events back then onto the roof. With any luck, the elements have yet to utterly destroy it.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Konda Densuke again)
:'''Konda Densuke:''' I wrote down all the events at that time and the location of the key before throwing the notes onto the roof. You can read it yourself.
:'''Konda Densuke:''' After entrusting the secret to a kind young person like you, I'm more relieved now...
:'''Konda Densuke:''' *sigh* Did Konda Village become like this because I couldn't fulfill my duty to the gods?
----
;(Read Konda Densuke's Notes on the rooftop above him)
:'''Konda Densuke's Notes:''' (Most of the notes are illegible due to their exposure to the elements.)
:'''Konda Densuke's Notes:''' "...But the lies and cover-up of this thievery weigh heavily on me. Therefore, I decide to leave these notes..."
:'''Konda Densuke's Notes:''' "...The group attacked the public drunkenly, stealing no small amount of goods and some pouches of Mora..."
:'''Konda Densuke's Notes:''' "...After much discussion, it was decided that this matter should be covered up... The cart was destroyed in the night. The goods and coin pouches were dumped down an empty well..."
:'''Konda Densuke's Notes:''' "...The well was sealed and locked, and the key was hidden in {{Color|buzz|a broken house across the gully on the east side of the village}}... Legend has it that it was built by [[Douin]]. Sadly, it's now so desolate that it proved a fitting choice to hide such a key..."
:'''Konda Densuke's Notes:''' "...Konda Village should've been prosperous. The Konda Clan should've thrived... I hope... for the sake of Takeru and Futaba... this village shall remain free of mishaps..."

===Into the Well===
{{Quest Description|update|The key to descending the well is {{sic|"within the wrecked house opposite the canal east of the village."}} You're getting closer to the heart of this mystery.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Head to the designated area)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. These people seem to be looking for something...
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe they're after the treasure, too?

;(After defeating the enemies, dig up the [[Old Key]])
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|You have obtained the key to descend the well. Since this is Hanachirusato's wish, find out what lies beneath in the greatest depths of Konda Village.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon:''' One dried well key successfully retrieved!
:'''Paimon:''' As long as it opens that dried-up well, that treasure's ours!
----
;(Open the [[Well Lock]] with the [[Old Key]])
:'''Well Lock:''' (The dry well is locked and looks like it could be opened with the corresponding key...)
:;(Opens Quest Item menu, use the [[Old Key]].)
:'''Paimon:''' It's open. C'mon, let's have at it. Carefully now...
----
;(Go into the well)
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|This space is much larger than first meets the eye. It looks like a good place to store some treasure, so you may as well take your time searching.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Pass through the Thunder Barrier at the bottom of the well)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, so this is the "underbelly"...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like something wild is sealed in here.
;(Approach the shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' This notch... Ah, that's right! Let's try putting the ward that we got from the shrine maiden in there!
;(After summoning the [[Ochimusha]])
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Who&mdash; No, what is that!?
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), be careful!
;(After defeating the [[Ochimusha]])
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Very impressive.
:'''Paimon:''' Eek! How did you... When did you... Why...
:{{DIcon}} Yikes!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I was right to have my eye on you. You are indeed qualified to perform the Cleansing.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you here...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' I was quite concerned as to your actions, and as to whether you could heal the roots or not, so I have been observing you a little. If I have offended you, please forgive me.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' I...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' As you can see, I am simply a shrine maiden who wishes to cleanse evil with your aid.
:'''Hanachirusato:'''  You have helped me greatly already by being able to undo the barrier.
:'''Paimon:'''  If she's been watching us all this time, that means...
:{{DIcon}} Are you reporting us to the authorities?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' The authorities? Who do you mean?
::'''Paimon:''' You know, the people in charge of the whole Konda Village thing.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Are you referring to the matter that the people of Konda Village have hidden away?
:{{DIcon}} Grandpa Densuke's secret...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I am loyal to Narukami Island, not some police station.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Besides, she... I have had dealings with Konda Village for a long time as well. If those families were to be cut off, I would not be able to face...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Please excuse me. Let us get back to business.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' As you may know, the Thunder Sakura trees symbolize the eternal watch of the Electro Archon, and they have the power to remove evil and purify the earth.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' However, the polluted tree roots will eventually be corroded, and these tainted sections will form tumors, one after another.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That is why we must perform the Cleansing Ritual.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Unfortunately, my... physical condition, shall we say, prevents me from accomplishing this deed.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' There are several more barriers of this kind. Can I ask you to aid me... No, to aid this land?
:{{DIcon}} What about your physical condition...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Do not fret... Our priority is the cleansing.
::{{DIcon}} I see. I'll help.
:{{DIcon}} Allow me to help.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Thank you, truly.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' As for the location of the next barrier, you can visit the abandoned shrine nearby. It's not far northeast of Konda Village.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Due to certain circumstances, I fear that I cannot go with you.
:{{DIcon}} How will we meet up, then?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "The sakura on the east and west banks differ in speed, and the flowers of the north and south branches vary their bloom."
:'''Hanachirusato:''' However, everything on this island is under her... Under the Sacred Sakura's shade. So long as petals still fall like snow upon this island, we will surely meet again.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I wish you all the best.

;(Talk to Hanachirusato)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' There should be no problem...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Ah, it's you. I wish you all the best.
