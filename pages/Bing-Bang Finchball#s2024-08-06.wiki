{{Description|While passing through [[Romaritime Harbor]] in [[Fontaine]], you encounter a cheery researcher named [[Basima the Fifth]]. At her most earnest entreaty, you begin to enjoy the relaxing tabletop game of "Bing-Bang Finchball"...}}
'''Bing-Bang Finchball''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 4.8]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2024/08/06 10:00 - 2024/08/19 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above
* Complete [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]]: Act III "[[Song of the Dragon and Freedom]]"

===Summary===
* During the event, launch the Finchballs according to the requirements, reach the designated number of points to complete the challenge and obtain Glittering Finch Coins. Accumulate a certain number of Glittering Finch Coins to obtain [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s, and other rewards.
* After the event begins, a total of 8 stages in the "Free & Easy Fun" mode and 7 stages in the "Hardly Even Hardball" mode will unlock over the course of the first 4 days.
* In the "Free & Easy Fun" mode, some stages will have Rival Finchballs in them. You must accurately launch Finchballs to knock Rival Finchballs out of the scoring area. When some stages start, the field will have friendly Normal Finchballs. You must accurately launch Finchballs so that more of them can land in the scoring area to score more points.
* In the "Hardly Even Hardball" mode, two players will square off against one another, taking turns to launch Finchballs. After the final round ends, the winner will be decided by tabulating the scores of the landing spots of each Finchball.
* After the event begins, the maximum number of Glittering Finch Coins obtainable will be increased by 500 for the first 4 days. Playing either the "Free & Easy Fun" mode or the "Hardly Even Hardball" mode will grant Glittering Finch Coins.

{{Description|Finches are often most active on sunny afternoons, when the blended scents of grass and soil are radiating upward.<br>They jump and play on the grass, and passing pinecones around using their heads is a popular pastime.<br>If one could procure some berry-and-wheat treats, why, this would be the perfect party!}}

===II - Huddled Warmth in Cool Conditions===
{{Description|Should the winds change direction, bringing the snowy mountain cold or desert night chill with them, solitary Finches will tremble at their touch.<br>The Finches will then sometimes seek out adventurers' bonfires and approach politely to warm themsevles, though that might prove a mistake should they encounter starving Treasure Hoarders!<br>As such, huddling tightly together is the more common method they use to keep the cold at bay.}}

===III - Hidden Base Behind a Tree Stump===
{{Description|Finches often nest in the treetops, but even they find it hard to carry heavy berries high up into the branches with their small bodies...<br>As such, some clever clogs amongst them will pick up withered branches and leaves to construct a "secret base" behind tree stumps where cats rarely come calling. Apart from storing delicious treats beloved amongst Finches, they also contain tools for Finch use.<br>For example, pinecone hats to protect one's head when picking berries, or dried mint leaves for polishing one's claws...}}

===IV - Forest Trail Etiquette===
{{Description|It is said that there is a small village in the forest depths whose inhabitants are Finches, and there dwell Finch laborers, Finch singers, and Finch architects.<br>Connecting the village and the outside world is but a single small path, one that may only be traversed by Finches.<br>And if a Finch mother should meet a returning Finch neighbor while sending her Finch children out, she will shift to the side a little to make space for her fellow Finch.<br>Thus it was that adventurers once unexpectedly discovered Finches to have knowledge of the polite etiquette of yielding the right of way...}}

===V - Mildly Ferocious Triangle Formation===
{{Description|Whether by injury or fatigue, Finches sometimes cannot fly freely.<br>If they should encounter hostile creatures while in this unfortunate state, other Finches will form a triangular formation, defending their fellow Finch with all their might.<br>If the other party should close with the vanguard, they shall peck them in the eyes, and if they should leap over the frontline, they shall peck at its paws... Or just peck, that works too!<br>Foes who are all bark and no bite can be overcome by small birdies with big courage (and ferocious beaks)!}}

===VI - A Surprise Celebration===
{{Description|Although Finches lack a precise sense of time and celebrate no birthdays, they do celebrate various happy occurrences!<br>If a certain Finch brings large amounts of food back multiple times, its companions will prepare a big surprise for it near its dwelling place.<br>When this Finch returns from its labors and turns a corner, it will be greeted by warm greetings from its companions.<br>And so they share precious delicacies they normally wouldn't indulge in, exchange ornamental gifts of broken shells or finely-crushed gems, and encourage one another, such that they may continue living out their gladsome days!}}
