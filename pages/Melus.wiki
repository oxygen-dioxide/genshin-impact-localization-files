==Profile==
Melus is the older of [[Navia]]'s two attendants.

During the events of ''[[Deluge of Wrathful Waters]]'', Melus was dissolved by the [[Primordial Sea]] while trying to save other people when the water began flooding Poisson. His consciousness was forged into an [[Oceanid]], where he and [[Silver]] protected Navia from the collective of other Poisson victims after she nearly fell into the water, who wanted to absorb her consciousness. The act was long enough for [[Neuvillette]] to save her from being completely dissolved, where he gave his final farewell to her.

===Appearance===
Melus wore a white shirt, a dark blue tie, a dark gray suit coat, black pants, white socks, black shoes, a black hat with a brown band, and dark sunglasses. He had short gray hair.
