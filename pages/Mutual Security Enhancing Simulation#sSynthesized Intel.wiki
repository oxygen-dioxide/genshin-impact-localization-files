|
{{MSES Attribute|Team}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 10s<br>
A Melee squad consisting of 3 Pyro Slimes. Immune to Pyro DMG.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Pyro Slimes.<br>A small monster created by the sedimentation of Pyro dispersed throughout nature, it is one of the most common dangers faced by adventurers and the security services of various nations alike.<br>For a human warrior with a given amount of training, a single slime poses a very limited threat. But when moving in groups, they become far more dangerous. They can be considered a standard unit for executing Elemental warfare, and discovering effective tactics for dealing with other Elemental creatures.}}
|-id="Electro Slime"

|
{{MSES Attribute|AoE}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 12s<br>
A standard frontline Melee unit. Swings its massive axe to deal Pyro DMG to nearby foes.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Blazing Axe Mitachurls.<br>Muscular hilichurls who wield large, two-handed axes. Strong enough to infuse their battle axes with remarkably destructive Pyro Elemental energy, they can seriously pressure a defensive line made up of ordinary humans.<br>In addition, Blazing Axe Mitachurls are widely distributed, and their numbers are nothing to sneeze at. They can be considered a "mainstay frontline unit" among monsters, and by focusing research on understanding the characteristics of their combat, generalized tactics for dealing with similar-sized monsters may be formulated.}}
|-id="Hilichurl Fighter"
|{{Card|Hilichurl Fighter|type=Enemy|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Team}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 9s<br>
A Melee squad consisting of 4 Hilichurl Fighters. While their attacks are ferocious, they are fragile.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Hilichurl Fighters.<br>The primitive wandering inhabitants of Teyvat's wildernesses, they are tribal warriors with a simple belief in the power of their physical prowess.<br>Compared to the massive Mitachurls, they are far nimbler. In battle, their club-wielding style of fighting is more similar to ordinary soldiers, and they can sometimes even cooperate well with their companions, making them an excellent sample for researching teamfighting tactics.}}
|-id="Kairagi: Dancing Thunder"
|{{Card|Kairagi: Dancing Thunder|type=Enemy|element=Electro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Single-Target}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 16s<br>
An elite frontline Melee unit with excellent staying power. Taking time to concentrate power into their katana, they deal massive Electro DMG to a single enemy unit.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Kairagi: Dancing Thunder.<br>Samurai who have fallen into banditry. They possess highly advanced martial arts skills, and can use the Kamuna art, which should have been lost, to infuse their blades with the power of Electro using talismans.<br>This type of foe has a robust physique, and are individually quite powerful. They are up to being used as the tip of the spear in assaults, breaking through defensive lines with evenly distributed forces. Researching their tactical tendencies is useful for resisting enemy units capable of rapidly penetrating defensive lines, or for setting up agile defense systems that allow for quickly concentrating forces to defend against dangerous foes before they can get through to the rear and cause a breakthrough.}}
|-id="Kairagi: Fiery Might"
|{{Card|Kairagi: Fiery Might|type=Enemy|element=Pyro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}

|
{{MSES Attribute|AoE}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 13s<br>
A standard frontline Melee unit. Concentrates power into dual blades, dealing AoE Cryo DMG.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Eremite Sunfrosts.<br>A professional mercenary who cares about nothing outside of work and the mission at hand.<br>As a warrior who has long wandered the harsh and unforgiving sands, they are formidable in combat even without unleashing the broken ominous spirits sealed within their weapons. Due to how their fighting style balances power and speed, the efficacy of a Sunfrost in battle is comparable to that of a squad. Using Cryo skills can provide significant control over the battlefield...}}
|-id="Eremite Desert Clearwater"
|{{Card|Eremite Desert Clearwater|type=Enemy|element=Hydro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Single-Target}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 13s<br>
A standard frontline Melee unit. Attacks multiple times with its blade, dealing Hydro DMG to a single enemy unit.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Eremite Desert Clearwaters.<br>A young lady lost in the ancient dream of the desert songs. To her, the thrill of bloody battle is her true reward.<br>The Desert Clearwater is the classic example of an agile yet deadly light unit that can use their mobility to take advantage of weak points while two sides are locked in combat to play a decisive role in deciding the outcome. The way she locks onto a single enemy and launches a continuous and ferocious assault is enough to make the soldiers of any army consider their tactics carefully before facing such a foe...}}
|-id="Geovishap Hatchling"
|{{Card|Geovishap Hatchling|type=Enemy|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|AoE}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Deploy Freely}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 12s<br>
A frontline Melee unit that can be deployed to enemy ranks. Uses spinning attacks to deal Physical DMG in an area around it.<br>Special: Deploy Freely. Can be deployed anywhere on the field.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Geovishap Hatchlings.<br>A young vishap with a hard Geo exoskeleton. Vishaps are exceptionally agile creatures that one would be wise not to underestimate in battle.<br>Thanks to their special way of moving, Geovishap Hatchlings have the ability to execute surprise attacks, covering distance quickly. The protection their armor offers against ordinary weapons is also an important part of their overall combat efficacy. Understanding the combat capabilities of such monsters is an effective way to increase the ability of each nation's military forces to deal with fast-moving, heavily armored units.}}
|-id="Hydro Mimic Finch"
|{{Card|Hydro Mimic Finch|type=Enemy|element=Hydro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|AoE}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Deploy Freely}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>

{{Description|A gamepiece based on Hydro Mimic Finches.<br>A Hydro Mimic creature created by the concentrated life force of Oceanids. Only a very small number of elite soldiers among the participating forces have seen such beings before.<br>Their pure Hydro-elemental body structure and area of effect Hydro attacks are both highly worthy of study, for any force that can effectively resist Hydro Mimic Finches can fend off other creatures with devastating offensive capabilities and maintain the integrity of their defensive line.}}
|-id="Nimble Harvester Mek - Pneuma"
|{{Card|Nimble Harvester Mek - Pneuma|type=Enemy|element=Anemo|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|AoE}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Deploy Freely}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 12s<br>
Assault-type Melee unit that will periodically charge, dealing Anemo DMG to enemies in a line.<br>Will normally stay in the same spot performing spinning attacks that deal Physical DMG.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Nimble Harvester Meks &mdash; Pneuma.<br>A clockwork meka designed to excavate and transport sand and soil that is powered by the energy produced from pneuma-ousia annihilation reactions. For this wargame simulation, it was designed as a unit that can only have the Pneuma alignment. Thanks to its unique appearance, it can quickly buzzsaw forward, striking targets along a straight line with considerable destructive force. Tactics developed to deal with this kind of meka can be adapted to defend against and respond to the attacks of catapults, rolling boulders, and all kinds of other tough monsters that make use of spinning movement.}}
|-id="Ruin Guard"
|{{Card|Ruin Guard|type=Enemy|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Siege}} {{MSES Attribute|Melee}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 12s<br>
A Siege Melee unit with strong staying power that will only attack Stronghold mechanisms and not attack any other enemy combat units.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Ruin Guards.<br>An ancient humanoid war machine armed with "explosive firepower" that can be found all over Teyvat. The armed services of various nations often use it as the default hypothetical enemy, and look for ways to destroy them from medium to long range. This is because the immense power they possess would utterly overwhelm ordinary people, and engaging in close combat with them is a very bad idea. Based on preliminary analysis, Ruin Guards are far more destructive towards buildings than to small, agile units, and so they have been designated as playing the role of the terrifyingly strong battering ram in this simulation.}}
|-id="Cryo Specter"
|{{Card|Cryo Specter|type=Enemy|element=Cryo|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Single-Target}} {{MSES Attribute|Flying}}<br>
CD: 13s<br>
A Flying unit that will take flight after being deployed. Launches Cryo energy projectiles at enemy units from the air. Immune to Cryo DMG.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Cryo Specters.<br>A monster born from highly-concentrated Cryo elements that can float in the air.<br>As a relatively compact and resilient flying monster, Specters have long been considered the touchstone for anti-aerial defensive capabilities by the armies of various nations. The results of attacking them with ordinary bows are far from ideal, and the mobility of more powerful ballistae and cannons is quite limited. Perhaps a highly mobile firing platform with significant firepower is required to deal with them...}}
|-id="Pyro Specter"
|{{Card|Pyro Specter|type=Enemy|element=Pyro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Single-Target}} {{MSES Attribute|Flying}}<br>

|{{Card|Electro Cicin|type=Enemy|element=Electro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Team}} {{MSES Attribute|Flying}}<br>
CD: 13s<br>
A flying squad consisting of 3 Electro Cicins that takes flight after being deployed and launches Electro projectiles at enemies from the air.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Electro Cicins.<br>A very small creature that can manipulate Electro a little bit. Its strength isn't anything to write home about, but under certain conditions, it can exert considerable power &mdash; Thanks to its compact dimensions and ability to fly beneath the treetops, it is difficult to detect Cicins, making early warning difficult. When conducting raids, they are often already nearly on top of their targets before they are discovered, by which point it is far too late to organize a defense. For this reason, using groups of Cicins as the hypothetical enemy is more than sufficient when training soldiers to deal with small, agile targets.}}
|-id="Hydro Cicin"
|{{Card|Hydro Cicin|type=Enemy|element=Hydro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Team}} {{MSES Attribute|Flying}}<br>

|-id="Floating Anemo Fungus"
|{{Card|Floating Anemo Fungus|type=Enemy|element=Anemo|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|AoE}} {{MSES Attribute|Flying}}<br>
CD: 13s<br>
A Flying unit that will take flight after being deployed. Launches Anemo energy projectiles at enemy units from the air that require a period of charging, dealing AoE Anemo DMG.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Floating Anemo Fungi.<br>A spore organism of some intelligence. It possesses extreme adaptability. Its hollow umbrella-like structure gives it excellent buoyancy, allowing it to float, suspended in midair. It is a classic small to mid-size Flying unit. When using the power of Anemo to attack, it can affect targets within a certain area of effect &mdash; a trait worthy of study. Its relatively moderate movement speed makes it an easy target for most soldiers, but its cuteness in both appearance and habit makes it difficult to pull the trigger...}}
|-id="Electro Hilichurl Shooter"
|{{Card|Electro Hilichurl Shooter|type=Enemy|element=Electro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Team}} {{MSES Attribute|Ranged}}<br>
CD: 10s<br>
A Ranged squad consisting of 2 Electro Hilichurl Shooters, well-suited to being deployed in the rear, attacking enemies from the back ranks.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Electro Hilichurl Shooters.<br>The primitive wandering inhabitants of Teyvat's wildernesses. These archers wield simple crossbows, and their arrowheads are crafted from carved Electro Crystals that will deliver an electric shock upon impact.<br>Based on field observations, Hilichurl Shooters will cooperate with their comrades who are better suited to close-quarters combat, forming the basic elements of combined arms combat tactics by coordinating ranged fire with melee attacks, and understand concentrating firepower on key targets. Hilichurl Shooters are therefore considered a standard ranged unit, useful for undertaking in-depth research that will produce easily applicable results...}}
|-id="Cryo Hilichurl Shooter"
|{{Card|Cryo Hilichurl Shooter|type=Enemy|element=Cryo|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}

{{Description|A gamepiece based on Cryo Hilichurl Shooters.<br>The primitive wandering inhabitants of Teyvat's wildernesses. These archers wield simple crossbows, and unmelting ice shrouds their arrowheads.<br>Based on field observations, Hilichurl Shooters will cooperate with their comrades who are better suited to close-quarters combat, forming the basic elements of combined arms combat tactics by coordinating ranged fire with melee attacks, and understand concentrating firepower on key targets. Hilichurl Shooters are therefore considered a standard ranged unit, useful for undertaking in-depth research that will produce easily applicable results...}}
|-id="Suppression Specialist Mek - Ousia"
|{{Card|Suppression Specialist Mek - Ousia|type=Enemy|element=Pyro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Single-Target}} {{MSES Attribute|Ranged}}<br>
CD: 14s<br>
An elite Ranged unit that fires multiple homing missiles, dealing Pyro DMG to a single enemy.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Suppression Specialist Meks.<br>A specialist clockwork meka adapted from the Cal. Scherbius type. They are primarily designed for offensive purposes. Outside of Fontaine, they can use pre-prepared Energy Blocks to move over short distances for short periods of time.<br>As an autonomous weapon of similar size to ordinary human soldiers, the dimensions and offensive capabilities of this meka have reached a certain balance, making it easier to deploy, move, and conceal. The combination of formidable ranged firepower and robust armor allows it to manifest significant offensive and defensive capabilities at the same time, and it is thus rated as a pillar of the battlefield.}}
|-id="Nobushi: Kikouban"
|{{Card|Nobushi: Kikouban|type=Enemy|element=Electro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Single-Target}} {{MSES Attribute|Ranged}}<br>
CD: 13s<br>
A unit with both Ranged and Melee capabilities. Periodically uses its Thunderbow to attack Ground or Flying units, dealing Electro DMG.<br>Normally uses its iai tachi to attack Ground units, dealing Physical DMG.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Nobushi: Kikouban.<br>Samurai who have fallen into banditry. They possess highly advanced sword skills and also use crossbows to ambush opponents, using any means to win.<br>Compared to ordinary bandits or Treasure Hoarders, this kind of foe has many more combat styles at their disposal. Their movements can be quite varied and difficult to predict, making them a subject worthy of detailed study. Using them as a unit during the wargame is conducive to training the thinking capabilities of soldiers, such that they might avoid suffering losses should they cross swords with such foes in the future.}}
|-id="Treasure Hoarder Pyro Potioneer"
|{{Card|Treasure Hoarders: Pyro Potioneer|type=Enemy|element=Pyro|show_caption=1|nolink=1|caption=Treasure Hoarder Pyro Potioneer}}

{{Description|A gamepiece based on Treasure Hoarder Pyro Potioneers.<br>A member of the decentralized criminal organization that has footprints all over the continent and even deep within unknown domains. Risk-takers who utilize their knowledge of chemistry to mix volatile and flammable brews that aid in their comrades' dastardly deeds.<br>Though as individuals, their combat skills are completely unremarkable, the Pyro Element reagent bottles they hurl create dangerous areas that continually burn, giving them the ability to effectively pin down their enemies. Learning about suppressive tactics and area denial from such a classic example is beneficial to soldiers of all stripes.}}
|-id="Hydro Samachurl"
|{{Card|Hydro Samachurl|type=Enemy|element=Hydro|show_caption=1|nolink=1}}
|
{{MSES Attribute|Single-Target}} {{MSES Attribute|Ranged}} {{MSES Attribute|Cannot Target Flying}}<br>
CD: 9s<br>
A Ranged unit that recites incantations, aiming at a single enemy Ground unit, dealing Hydro DMG after a short period.<br>Special: Surface-to-Surface. This unit's ranged attacks cannot attack flying units, and can only target Ground units.
{{Description|A gamepiece based on Hydro Samachurls.<br>A wizened, mumbling hilichurl, one that chants of the power of Hydro. For reasons unknown they have mastered the secret of summoning water and rain.<br>"Hydro" often plays a pivotal role on the battlefield, and effectively using the effects created by its power can yield considerable advantages. Using these commonly-found Hydro Samachurls as a starting point to research water-based tactics not only acts as a cost-saving measure, but allows for steady, incremental progress.}}
