'''Sourcewater Droplets''' are entities that can be used by the [[Hydro Traveler]], [[Neuvillette]], and [[Sigewinne]] for [[healing]] and enhancing combat abilities.

==Properties==
Droplets generated by characters can be used by other characters. For example, Neuvillette can absorb droplets created by Traveler and Sigewinne, and vice versa.

Droplets can be grouped together via [[Vacuum Field]] abilities, similar to bomblets and other entities generated by other character talents. 

A droplet can exist for 15 seconds at a time, after which it will expire. A max of 12 Sourcewater Droplets generated by Neuvillette can exist on field at a given time. If more Sourcewater Droplets are created while there are 12 on the field, the oldest Sourcewater Droplets will despawn. Droplets generated by the Traveler do not count towards this limit. 

In [[Co-Op Mode]], the player can only see droplets generated by themselves.
