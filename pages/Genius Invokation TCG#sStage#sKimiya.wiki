{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kimiya)
:'''Kimiya:''' Am I playing cards for research? I mean, some people do perform divination with cards, but that's not within the scope of my research...
:'''Kimiya:''' So the answer is no. I'm only playing it for fun's sake. Are you gonna play with me?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Let's play Genius Invokation TCG.
:;(Open Genius Invokation TCG challenge interface)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Kimiya:''' Cool. Maybe next time.

;(If the player loses the match)
:'''Kimiya:''' Haha, not your lucky day, eh?

;(If the player wins the match)
:'''Kimiya:''' Wait, you really did that? Was that even possible!?
