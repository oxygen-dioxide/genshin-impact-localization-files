:{{A|vo nteq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why are all these people gathered around? Did something happen?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go take a look!
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 01.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' How's it looking, doc? Is there... any hope for him?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Chill, bro. I'm thinking.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 02.ogg}} '''???:''' This dude's... [[Milray]], right? What a lil' champ... Barely made a noise, despite all the pain he must be in. Did he fight in the war?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 02.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' That's right. We'd never normally send such a young Tepetlisaur into battle, but we couldn't stop him. Developed a real knack for sneaking past us and running off to the frontline to fight the [[Abyss]].
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 03.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' He's a smart one, that's for sure. Might not be the strongest, but he ran rings around those Abyssal monsters.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 04.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' We even awarded him a Warrior's Medal after the war ended. But then he took a turn for the worse a few days ago. He's been having fainting spells ever since...
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Poor little guy... Already a battle-worn veteran, yet still so young.
:'''Milray:''' *whimper*
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, [[Kachina]], what's going on here?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, long time no see.
:{{Introductory Note|Kachina}}
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' So basically, there's this young Tepetlisaur in our tribe called Milray. We're not sure what's wrong with him, but he's been getting weaker and weaker by the day. [[Ifa]]'s taking a look at him.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' [[Naiyan]], who he grew up with, is here too. We're all really worried about him.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 tiyaca 01.ogg}} '''Tiyaca:''' When my daughter got lost in the mountains, it was Milray who helped bring her back.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 yolehua 01.ogg}} '''Yolehua:''' To think that he made it through the war, but now that peace has finally come... *sigh*
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 cacucu 01.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Steady there, bro. We'll find a way.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, you're that... Qucu-Thesaurus from the vet clinic!
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 cacucu 02.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Huh? What are you on about?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this "Ifa" you just mentioned is actually&mdash;
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 04.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Hey, yo, everyone, please chill! I think I've got this figured out.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 05.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' For a juvenile [[saurian]], he showed remarkable courage in the war, but he's too young to be using that much [[phlogiston]].
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 06.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' As a result, he developed a rare pathological change. The initial symptoms might not have been obvious, but he's gone untreated for so long that his condition is now very serious.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 05.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' You mean he originally got sick during the war, but the symptoms only just started to show up now?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 07.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' That's right. He may have just been acting tough this whole time... Didn't want his friends stressing out over him.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 naiyan 01.ogg}} '''Naiyan:''' Wooo... Rrrooo!
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 milray 01.ogg}} '''Milray:''' Rroooh...
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Ifa, there must be something you can do, right? Please, help him!
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 08.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Something this rare? I don't have anything on hand that can treat it.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 09.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Good news is that I read about a similar case back when I was still studying. The scroll mentioned two essential ingredients.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 10.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' First up, an herbaceous perennial known as an "Ocean Zephyr"... Though they can grow practically anywhere, they're exceedingly rare.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 11.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' The second... Honestly, I couldn't figure it out back then either. The name recorded was "Sacred Flame Crystal," but there wasn't much else to go on beyond that.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Sacred Flame]]... Like the one burning in the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame|Stadium]]?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' When Mualani and I took part in the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], we collected loads of [[Contending Spark]]s during the team stage.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 kachina 06.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Apparently they're sparks from the Sacred Flame itself. They even make you feel all warm and fuzzy while you carry them! Do you think these Crystals might be something similar?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 12.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' From the name, I'd say we're lookin' for a rarer, purer form of Sacred Flame.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure there's even such a thing? We've been in Natlan for ages now, but we've never come across anything like that.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 06.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' ...So it would seem, as it happens.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 together 01.ogg}} '''Kachina & Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 kachina 07.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' For real, Uncle [[Pacal]]?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 07.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' It's a coincidence that I've even heard of it. Apparently, the people of Natlan knew how to make a special kind of "Sacred Flame Crystal" way back when.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 08.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' I'm not sure exactly how they did it, but the other chiefs might know something... I'll go ask them.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 09.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' Thank you, Ifa, your diagnosis was a huge help. Mind if I keep you a little longer?
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 ifa 13.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Sure thing, dude. I'll stick around until we've got some results.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 10.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' Great. In that case, let's go our separate ways for now. Milray needs some proper rest, and he's not gonna get that with so many people gathered around.
:{{A|vo nteq001 1 pacal 11.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' I'll let you all know as soon as there's any news. Fingers crossed, he'll soon be on the mend.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 01.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' What up, my dudes?
:{{DIcon}} Umm... Hello?
::{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 02a 1.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Haha, hey, come on, chill.
:{{DIcon}} Your rep precedes you, bro. Respect.
::{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 02b 1.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Man, I can tell we're totally on the same wavelength.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 03.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' The name's Ifa, a vet from the Flower-Feather Clan. This here's my assistant, [[Cacucu]]. Dude's all about copying what others say.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're...
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 04.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' {{Traveler}} and Paimon, yeah? Everyone's heard all about you two &mdash; you're absolute legends!
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 05.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' The total package: Brave, wise, and strong... Best hero duo I've ever seen, no contest!
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, hehe, you're making Paimon blush!
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 06.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Truth is, I spent the war treating wounded saurians. Never got a chance to fight alongside you.
:{{DIcon}} You saved so many saurian lives. That was an amazing contribution too!
:{{DIcon}} A legend among vets.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 07.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Yo, thanks bro! I appreciate that!
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' There was always a long line outside Ifa's clinic back then. Even Cacucu was so busy he was running around like a headless chicken.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 cacucu 01.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Seriously! Seriously!
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 08.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' True that... more wounded were pilin' up by the day.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 09.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Dude, the Abyss is no joke, sneaky enough to hit us right where it hurts. Lots of docs have dropped at their posts over the last few years...
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 10.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' There's some fresh talent rolling in recently, I'm hoping they can step up quick. But vet med's no joke. There's a ton of challenges to overcome before you can be a qualified vet.
:{{DIcon}} That's rough...
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 11.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' No matter how hard you hit the books, you're still gonna run into all kinds of weird diseases that are hard to treat. Like Milray's &mdash; so rare it doesn't even have a name.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 12.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' If my old man hadn't forced me to read all kinds of different stuff when I was a kid, I'd probably only be able to suggest a more conservative treatment. It's true what they say, bro &mdash; there's always more to learn.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so your dad was a vet too?
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 13.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Yeah, totally. Our family's medical knowledge has been passed down over generations. My old man started steering me toward being a vet when I was a kid, schooling me on all kinds of herbs. And man, if I forgot anything, out came the broom.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 14.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' My family's been vets for generations now. No clue who it was that kicked off the tradition though, you know?
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 15.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Back when I was a kid, my dad said something about our skills being "medicine born of guilt"... But the reason we got into it doesn't really matter &mdash; what matters is that it's useful.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guilt? Sounds pretty strange to Paimon. Usually, you only feel guilty when you've done something wrong...
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 16.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Who knows? After he passed, there wasn't anybody else I could ask. I figure it's because guilt gnaws at anyone practicing medicine. When you fail to fix someone up... I've been there.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 17.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' So I'm gonna do my best to make sure that doesn't happen this time. I don't recall ever seeing a record of any patient with his malady who was successfully cured, so maybe Milray will be the first.
:{{DIcon}} You've got this, bro.
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 18.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Heck yeah, I do.
:{{Black Screen|You talk for a while longer...}}
:{{A|vo nteq001 2 ifa 19.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Oh? Looks like the chiefs are back. Let's go see what they have to say.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|While you were chatting, the tribal chiefs came back. Would they know anything about the Sacred Flame Crystals? Now's a good time to ask and see.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the chiefs)
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 01.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' The last time I was here, I remember seeing him happily rolling around with [[Ayo]]. This is so sudden..
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Well, as the saying goes, "illness strikes like a landslide." It's not uncommon for people and saurians to just collapse overnight.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Given that he first fell sick during the war, he's done well to make it this far.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 amina 01.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Hey, little guy, are you okay? Does it hurt?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' For one so young to risk life and limb on the field of battle... This, too, is a responsibility we adults must bear.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, all six tribal chiefs in one place! Not something you see every day...
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 02.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Haha, it's true that we used to hardly ever meet up like this. The affairs of our own tribes were usually enough to keep us all swamped.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 03.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' These days, though, group dinners on our days off have practically become the routine, so don't look too surprised.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 acatl 02.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Group dinners? More like group mooching! You guys always seem to end up at my place... So shameless.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 04.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Well, your cooking is too good to resist. You've seen how hopeless the rest of us are in that regard... *ahem* Anyway, let's get down to business.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 mutota 02.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Ifa, we've been informed about the situation. Once again, it's a good thing you were here to help out.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 mutota 03.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Milray and the other Tepetlisaurs have helped transport goods for the Flower-Feather Clan in the past. We won't just stand by and watch while he suffers.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 ifa 01.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' I just happened to come across a record of a case like his back home, but I don't know anything about this "Sacred Flame Crystal."
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 amina 02.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I haven't heard of it either. Can the Sacred Flame even take other forms?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 02.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It can indeed. While I've never seen this happen in the flesh, I have read references to it in woven scrolls.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 03.ogg}} '''Biram:''' In ancient Natlan, besides the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, there is said to have been another way to produce Sacred Flame, known as the "[[Bloomflower Trials]]."
:;(A [[Yumkasaurus Whelp]] is shown walking nearby)
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 04.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It was a combat exercise held jointly by the six tribes that was even more intense than the Pilgrimage, so they occasionally yielded an even purer form of Sacred Flame.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 together 01.ogg}} '''Kachina & Paimon:''' Sacred Flame Crystals!?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 ifa 02.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' For real? How have I never heard of that...?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 05.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Simple. The Bloomflower Trials haven't been held for centuries.
:{{DIcon}} Is there some hidden story behind this?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 06.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Something seems to have happened the last time they were held, but it was so long ago that I don't know the specifics.
:;(A [[Koholasaurus Whelp]] is secretly watching from a distance)
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 07.ogg}} '''Biram:''' The more reasonable explanation is this &mdash; that people once believed these Sacred Flame Crystals to be vessels of extraordinary power, and that warriors could use them to enhance their own strength.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 08.ogg}} '''Biram:''' In reality, they turned out to be far less miraculous than hoped for. In some rare, very specific circumstances, they proved irreplaceable, but they were not so different from the regular Sacred Flame in essence.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 09.ogg}} '''Biram:''' The Pilgrimage produced enough Sacred Flame, making the Bloomflower Trials obsolete. And thus, they were forgotten.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 ifa 03.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Ah, I get it. So to save Milray, we have to revive the Bloomflower Trials and get all six tribes to take part. That sounds rough...
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 05.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I'd say we'd be better off not treating it like some kind of hassle.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 06.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' All six tribes need to take part, sure, but not everyone has to show up. We can keep it voluntary, so warriors who happen to have time can sign up and fight it out of their own accord.
:;(A [[Tatankasaurus Whelp]] is shown watching from a distance, which Ifa notices)
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 07.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Since the war ended, the Pilgrimage has become more like a tournament for our warriors to compete in and keep themselves in shape, so why not let them hone their skills on a fresh new stage?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 mutota 04.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' We should never drop our guard completely, even in times of peace. Put like that, it seems high time we restarted the Bloomflower Trials.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 acatl 03.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' I'm with you on that. Nothing gets the blood pumping like a contest to see which tribe's the strongest, huh?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 10.ogg}} '''Biram:''' No objections on my part.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 amina 03.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I'll go discuss this with the others. I'm sure there'll be plenty of warriors who'll be itching to take part.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 amina 04.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I can't speak for everyone else, but I can guarantee that [[Mualani]] will be there &mdash; there's nothing she loves more than a lively occasion.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 08.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' And I guess your vote was a foregone conclusion, eh, Pacal? Great, we're all in agreement, then.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice!
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 pacal 01.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' ...Thanks, everyone, it really means a lot.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 09.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Let's head back to our tribes and see how many people are willing to sign up. If interest is high, we'll hold a big event, but if not, we'll keep it small.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 mutota 05.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Agreed. Rules will be crucial too. A competition without rules is just mindless violence, and that's not what we want.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 biram 11.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I'll draw up an outline. Let's meet up at the Speaker's Chamber later &mdash; after all, we'll still need the Pyro Archon's final approval.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 amina 05.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Oh yeah, and we'll also need some Ocean Zephyrs to cure Milray. Who'll go gather them while we're organizing the Trials?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 ifa 04.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' I've got that covered... I just noticed that some of Milray's friends have shown up.
:;(All the saurians hiding nearby revealed themselves)
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 mutota 06.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' You mean these saurians? You're right, there's all sorts. Seems like he's quite the popular little fella, huh...
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 ifa 05.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Cacucu, can you hit them up and ask if they'd be down to lend a claw?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 cacucu 01.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Sure thing, bro. I've got you, bro.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 wayna 10.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Hah, must be nice having a saurian companion who can talk...
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 acatl 04.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Well, if that's everything, how about we call it a day?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 mutota 07.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Alright. See you later.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 mutota 08.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Ifa, let's head back &mdash; and bring these saurians along too. We've gotta teach them how to identify Ocean Zephyrs.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 amina 06.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Seeya, little guy. We'll come visit you again soon.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, they sure are quick on their feet!
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess they're chiefs for a reason &mdash; when they decide on something, it gets done right away...
:{{DIcon}} More the "Let's sleep on it" type, are we, Paimon?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, but that's what you're here for, right? Whenever Paimon puts things off, even for just a while, you'll handle them straight away!
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 cacucu 02.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Oh wow... No way, bro!
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Even Cacucu's done with this conversation...
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 pacal 02.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' I'll go spread the word. Kachina, you gonna sign up?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' O&mdash;Of course!
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 pacal 03.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' In that case, let's head over together. {{Traveler}}, Paimon, see you at the Speaker's Chamber in a bit.
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See ya!
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So far, so good! At this rate, Milray will be better in no time.
:'''Milray:''' *whimper*...
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, you're awake? Wanna try getting a bit more sleep?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 milray 02.ogg}} '''Milray:''' Rrrrawrrr...
:{{DIcon}} I feel like...
:{{DIcon}} ...He has something to say?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You think so? Is he feeling hungry, then?
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Cacucu! Can you help us transl&mdash;
:{{A|vo nteq001 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, long gone! Oh no, he does seem pretty anxious... What are you trying to say, little guy?
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Plans have been made to hold the Bloomflower Trials, and the chiefs have returned to their tribes to make arrangements. As you prepare to leave, the little Tepetlisaur Milray suddenly looks very anxious. Does it have something it wants to say?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After competing the previous step)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It seems like the Bloomflower Trials are all set to take place, which means we've got the Sacred Flame Crystals covered, and Milray's saurian buddies are out collecting Ocean Zephyrs too. So, on paper at least, everything should be fine...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (But why does Milray look so anxious? Has his condition gotten worse? We'd better ask him, just in case.)

;(Talk to Milray or Naiyan, optional)
:'''Milray:''' ...
:'''Naiyan:''' ...

;(Talk to Milray or Naiyan while indwelling a Tepetlisaurus<!-- Yumkasaurus does not give any interaction options -->)
:'''Milray:''' *Rrraw* *cough* *cough*
:'''Naiyan:''' Everything okay, Milray? Do you wanna eat something?
:'''Naiyan:''' Wh&mdash;Why don't I go pick you some fruit?
:'''Milray:''' Thanks for looking after me, Naiyan. I'll be fine...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Hello, Milray and Naiyan.
:'''Naiyan:''' Oh? Who are you...?
:'''Naiyan:''' Haven't seen you around here before, hmm... Have you come to visit Milray, too?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Yeah! I just wanted to tell you that you have nothing to worry about, okay? Those nice humans have found a way to cure you.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' It won't be long before they've gathered enough Ocean Zephyrs and Sacred Flame Crystals, so hang in there &mdash; you'll be on the mend soon.
:'''Milray:''' Sacred Flame Crystals... *cough* *cough*
:'''Naiyan:''' Milray...
:'''Milray:''' That's exactly what I'm worried about. Those nice humans have no idea how dangerous Sacred Flame Crystals are...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ...Dangerous?
:'''Milray:''' Yes, very dangerous. They can beguile human hearts, turn friends into enemies... The humans must be very careful...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Milray struggles to say something else, but he soon falls unconscious once more.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ("Beguile human hearts"? The chiefs didn't mention anything about that before... Could there be unknown risks associated with using Sacred Flame Crystals?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (But, more importantly... If even the chiefs know nothing about this, despite all the knowledge they possess, then where did Milray and Naiyan come to hear of it?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Naiyan, who told you guys that Sacred Flame Crystals were dangerous?
:'''Naiyan:''' A mysterious [[Qucusaur]] we met while fighting those big monsters... He was the one who told us.
:;(Flashback begins)
:'''Naiyan:''' I still remember how our friends were all running around in a panic the first time Milray passed out...
:'''???:''' Not this disease, not again... We'll need to find Ocean Zephyrs and Sacred Flame Crystals...
:'''???:''' But Sacred Flame Crystals can beguile human hearts, turn friends into enemies... What should I do?
:;(Flashback ends)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Where did this Qucusaur find out, then?
:'''Naiyan:''' I don't know... He often said things we couldn't understand. Apart from us, no other little saurians wanted to play with him, and as far as I could tell, he didn't have any human companions either.
:'''Naiyan:''' But I'm sure he wouldn't have lied to us. He's saved us many times, and we're very close friends.
:'''Naiyan:''' I really, really hope that Milray recovers soon. But if Sacred Flame Crystals genuinely are that dangerous... I don't think that's the way he would want to be saved.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Don't worry, I'm here to help.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' I'll remind the humans to be careful. In the meantime, you take good care of Milray, alright? Just make sure he doesn't worry too much and gets lots of rest.
:'''Naiyan:''' You'd do that for him? Thank you so much!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (This is becoming more mysterious by the minute. With Mavuika and the six chiefs present, I'm sure everything will be alright &mdash; but still, I'd better find a chance to talk to Mavuika about it.)

;(Talk to Milray or Naiyan again while indwelling a saurian<!-- both Tepetlisaurus and Yumkasaurus confirmed -->, optional)
:'''Milray:''' ...
:'''Naiyan:''' You'd better get well soon, Milray. There are still so many things I want to say to you.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Who knew there would be such unfavorable rumors about Sacred Flame Crystals... It'd be good to also bring this up with Mavuika.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter the Speaker's Chamber)
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've read through your proposal, and it sounds like a great idea.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even if it wasn't for Milray's situation, there'd be many reasons to start holding the Bloomflower Trials again. How many warriors have been signing up?
:{{Introductory Note|Mavuika}}
: {{A|vo nteq001 5 wayna 01.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Far more than we anticipated.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Our warriors sure are fired up! The ones who came late even held a protest outside the signup booth, so we had to make an exception by adding a few more spots.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' So many people have signed up that we've had to divide the competition up into main matches and exhibition matches. Each main match will pit two different tribes against one another, while the exhibition matches will see three tribes going up against another three.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 biram 02.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I'm planning to limit the number of spots for the exhibition matches. Accidents are more likely in tangled melees, so with fewer contestants, we can ensure that any injuries will be attended to promptly.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, you've clearly thought this through with care. You have my approval &mdash; and don't worry, I'll find a way to fund it.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 together 01.ogg}} '''Chiefs:''' Thank you, Archon!
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Where will the Trials be held? I'll stop by later to see how things are going, but I won't be taking part. Wouldn't want to spoil everyone else's fun.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 pacal 01.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' The main venue will be near the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, with additional arenas set up around the various tribes.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Alright, I'm all out of questions. Keep at it, everyone, and thanks for your hard work.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 amina 01.ogg}} '''Amina:''' In that case, we'll be off. It's time we started organizing crews to set up the venues.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon... Good luck.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Good luck with... what, exactly?
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hey! It's been a while, you two. Are you here about the Bloomflower Trials too?
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, we sure are. Sounds like everything's going to plan!
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "Bloomflower Trials"... The name alone fills me with nostalgia. I first heard about it from my dad, who first heard about it from his dad, my old grandpa.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess that means they were last held at least 500 years ago...? Wait a sec, no, it must have been much earlier than that, then...
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, when you put it like that, it does feel kinda surreal that we're doing something that hasn't been done in such a long time!
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' True, but I've got a good feeling about this. We'll pull it off, rest assured.
:{{DIcon}} Do you know anything about Sacred Flame Crystals?
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything dangerous about them?
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hmm? What makes you ask?
:{{DIcon}} We've heard rumors that Sacred Flame Crystals can "beguile human hearts"...
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hmm... I've never heard such a rumor before. And rationally speaking, it just doesn't even seem possible.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The rules governing the [[Ode of Resurrection]] have protected Natlan for many long years, and these rules are themselves fueled by the Sacred Flame's power. We've been working with the Sacred Flame all this time, and we've never noticed anything unusual about it.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' In essence, Sacred Flame Crystals are just another form of the Sacred Flame. I can't imagine how they could possibly "beguile human hearts."
:{{DIcon}} That's very true.
:{{DIcon}} I find it hard to imagine too.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So please, be at ease. And besides, even if they did harbor some kind of evil power, it will not cause any real trouble in the Natlan we now live in &mdash; not if I have anything to say about it.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Our main priority right now is to hold the Bloomflower Trials so we can collect enough Sacred Flame Crystals to heal that little Tepetlisaurus.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, it's so reassuring to have you on our side, Mavuika.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, there are some things even I can't handle.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' For example... It just came to my attention that you've got some people waiting for you outside.
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Who could they be?
:{{A|vo nteq001 5 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You'll find out soon enough... Go on, now. Don't keep them waiting.

;(Talk to Mavuika again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog nteq001 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A new competition brings a new challenge... And who knows? Maybe even a whole new story.

:{{Introductory Note|Mualani}}
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon. So basically...
:{{Introductory Note|Iansan}}
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hold up, what happened to "first come, first served"? What I'm saying is, I get to go first!
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, what's going on? Why has everyone turned up all of a sudden?
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Umm, so...
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' *ahem* So, you know about the Bloomflower Trials, right? I&mdash; I mean we, were wondering... Have you decided which tribe you'll join? If not, how about the [[People of the Springs]]?
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhhh, what&mdash;!?
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're allowed to take part too!?
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Given that the Trials haven't been held in so long, we're creating a new set of rules for them, separate from the ones for the Pilgrimage.
:{{Introductory Note|Kinich}}
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' All of the chiefs have agreed. But whether or not you compete, or which tribe you support... Well, that's completely up to you.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' As the hero who saved Natlan, your participation would be a huge morale boost for whoever you choose to join. In other words, recruiting you is every tribe's top priority right now.
:{{Introductory Note|Chasca}}
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's what's going on! No wonder Chief [[Acatl]] wished us good luck just now... He must have known this was coming!
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe &mdash; and that's all for the chit-chat. I hope you're ready for some serious incentives.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' How do you like the sound of luxury hot spring vouchers? I'll even throw in a selection of fine gifts from the shop!
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Luxury hot springs... Sounds like Paimon's perfect vacation!
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' If you join the [[Scions of the Canopy]], we'll hold a great barbecue in your honor. The finest quality meat, all you can eat.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' And if you join right away, you'll even stand a chance of being taken on as a sidekick of the Almighty Dragonlord, [[K'uhul Ajaw]]!
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Yeah, no one wants that.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Kinich, you little&mdash;
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All you can eat barbecue... *salivating*...
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Join up with the Collective of Plenty, and I'll provide a year's worth of training sessions and a personalized nutrition plan to help you become stronger than you already are.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm... Paimon's not too keen on training, but getting stronger does sound tempting...
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' All I've got to offer are freshly picked vegetables. But I can guarantee they are really tasty.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooohh, could Paimon get some samples?
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Fancy some flying lessons? Or you could just hitch a ride. I'll take you soaring through the skies myself.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Flying's kinda what Paimon does for a living, but flying around with {{Traveler}} sounds like it could be a lot of fun too!
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I&mdash;I can bake [[Saurus Crackers]] and [[Grainfruit Chips]]!
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, Paimon loves those too... This is such a tough choice.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not just 'cause the freebies are tempting, but also because picking one tribe feels like we're betraying all the others...
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y'know what? Paimon's decided... to leave this one to you.
:{{DIcon}} How about I join you all, then?
:{{DIcon}} "Tumaini" belongs to all of Natlan, after all.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh, Paimon's pretty sure that isn't an option...
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Actually, it's not a bad idea... It could work for the exhibition matches, at least.
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 kinich 05a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo nteq001 6 kinich 05b.ogg}}--> '''Kinich:''' There'd be three tribes on each side. So, for the first half, you're on our side. Second half, theirs.

:{{A|vo nteq001 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What, really? Then as for those perks you mentioned earlier... Hehe...
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Don't worry, my offer still stands. Enjoying ourselves is the number one priority here!
:{{A|vo nteq001 6 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' So it's settled, then? For the first half of the exhibition match, you'll join the Scions of the Canopy, the People of the Springs, and the Children of Echoes, fighting against the other three tribes.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "So it's settled, then?

;(Start the competition)<!-- spacetime rift domain entrance -->
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, so this is our base. According to the rules, all we have to do is capture three of their bases in a row, and we win!
:{{DIcon}} Let's go over our game plan.
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Hehe, the Almighty Dragonlord K'uhul Ajaw needs only lift a claw, and... Poof! All that you behold shall be turned to ashes!
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Mess up our match, and I'll lock you up till it's all over.

:{{A|vo nteq001 7 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, we're a real dream team! Let's just charge right in!
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' We know each other pretty well, so working together should be a breeze. Still, let's not get careless.
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' There are a lot of cliffs nearby, so our vision will be obscured. They could ambush us from the high ground too.
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' In that case, let's follow the water instead!
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' See that flag over there &mdash; that's the Collective of Plenty's base, right?
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We'll approach swiftly on the water, sweep in and capture the base, then move up to the high ground!
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I like the way you think.
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I trust your judgment too, Mualani.
:{{DIcon}} They won't know what hit 'em.
:{{DIcon}} We'll catch them completely off guard.
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright then! Time for me and my Sharky Surfboard to strut our stuff!
:{{A|vo nteq001 7 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I'll take point! Everyone, follow me!

;(Approach [[Iansan]])
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Here by the water route, just as expected... Classic People of the Springs thinking.
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Huh...? They saw through our plan?
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' No choice but to face them head on now.
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I'm ready!
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Alright then, time for a real showdown!

;(After defeating the first wave of enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hey, no slacking! Give this everything you've got!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Not a bad training session. Let's call it a day.
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Whew, we won...
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, at this rate, we'll be invincible!
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Don't count your [[Yumkasaur]]s yet... Let's head over to the next spot.
:{{A|vo nteq001 8 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Wait a sec... Don't forget to plant our flag before we leave. This is proof of our victory!

;(Approach the foot of the cliff under the Masters of the Night-Wind's base)
:{{A|vo nteq001 9 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' See that, up above the cliffs? That's the Masters of the Night-Wind's base.
:{{A|vo nteq001 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhhh... The nearby mountainsides have all been blocked off by crystal clusters. Looks like they don't want us getting up there so easily.
:{{A|vo nteq001 9 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Don't worry, leave this to Turbo Twirly!
:{{A|vo nteq001 9 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You've got this, Kachina!

;(Approach [[Ororon]])

;(After defeating the first wave of enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq001 9 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Is that all you have?

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq001 9 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Chances are looking slim... Perhaps it's time I got going.

;(Switch the flag)
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, we've taken the Masters of the Night-Wind's base too.
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Look, up there on the mountain &mdash; the flag of the Flower-Feather Clan!
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, looks like they're already on high alert.
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Yeah. Not only do they have the high ground, but they're highly mobile, too. With our current forces, a frontal assault won't be easy.
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Looks like I showed up right on cue, huh?
:{{Introductory Note|Xilonen}}
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay, you're here too, [[Xilonen]]!
:{{DIcon}} They did mention reinforcements...
:{{DIcon}} ...But this is a formidable ally indeed.
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Let's save the small talk for when the flag's in the bag.
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Now that backup's arrived, let's split up into two teams.
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'll lead a frontal assault to draw their fire.
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The rest of you find another route up and strike directly at the heart of their base.
:{{A|vo nteq001 10 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, I can taste our victory already!

;(If the Flower-Feather Clan's base is approached from the front)
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold up, that's where Xilonen's headed. Let's find another way.

;(Approach the Flower-Feather Clan's base from the side or back)
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Okay, let's stop around here. We can use grappling hooks to climb up to the top.

;(Approach [[Chasca]])
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Well, would you look at that. You managed to find a gap in our defenses somehow.
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' But this is just the beginning, so stay on your feet... if you can.
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' We're not gonna lose!
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Well said. Let's do this.
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's have ourselves some fun!

;(After defeating the first wave of enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Still got plenty of bullets left with your names on 'em.

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq001 11 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Alright, how about we call it a day?

;(Switch the flag)
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Phew... Does that mean we've won?
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, told you we'd be unstoppable!
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Well that was pretty exhilarating, even as battles go.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You can say that again! I was still fighting off Qucusaur Riders halfway up the mountainside when I heard you'd already taken the base.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That was well played!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for covering us...
:{{DIcon}} ...We wouldn't have taken the base the way we did otherwise.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, the going would've been way tougher if we had fought our way up...
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' How about the Sacred Flame Crystals? Did anyone manage to get their hands on some?
:;([[Citlali]] is shown approaching the group)
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I found a few shards, but they were only about as big as Grainfruit Chips. I gave them to the marshals from the Masters of the Night-Wind on our way back.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Yes, and they gave them to me.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Granny Citlali! Are you here to take part in the Bloomflower Trials too?
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I devised the techniques for the main matches, so of course I would show up.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Those marshals handed the Sacred Flame Crystals over as soon as they saw me.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I did a quick tally. At this rate, we should have enough by the event's end.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's awesome!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Even Citlali didn't notice anything strange about the Sacred Flame Crystals. Am I just overthinking this?)
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, since everything's gone so smoothly, why don't we hit the hot springs tonight?
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'm all for it. There's nothing like letting our hair down after a hard day's work. And good food and drink wouldn't go down badly either.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' How about we head over there together? You can all hitch a ride on Turbo Twirly!
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Sorry, but I need to head back to the workshop to finish up some forging commissions first. Let's meet at the People of the Springs later this evening.
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I need to help at the shop anyway, so I'll pick up some snacks there. See you all tonight!
:{{A|vo nteq001 12 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I might be a bit late. If you're all there earlier, feel free to start without me.

:'''Charlotte:''' All that time, all that effort, coming all the way from [[Fontaine]]... It'll all be worth it! I only brought a single [[Kamera]], but that should be enough...
:'''Charlotte:''' Let me think... I still need to go interview some other contestants... Oh yeah, they're even saying the Pyro Archon herself will be appearing, aren't they?
:'''Charlotte:''' If I can get a picture of her... Hehe, won't that be a massive scoop?
