==Profile==
"The Qingce Kid" is a Treasure Hoarder Boss who sent [[Erge]] to find the Helm of Warding, one of six Millelith treasures left behind in [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]]. After Erge fails to find the helm, mistaking the worn-down Millelith headgear for common miner's gear, "The Qingce Kid" waits for someone else to find it in Erge's stead. When the [[Traveler]] ends up finding it, "The Qingce Kid" bangs on the door leading into the hut, demanding them to hand over the relic. Confronting him is entirely optional.

When the Traveler confronts him, "The Qingce Kid" divulges that he is searching for the Millelith treasures and picks a fight with the Traveler. After being defeated, "The Qingce Kid" flees the scene, with his parting dialogue revealing he mistook them for a miner that lived in the area.

===Appearance===
"The Qingce Kid" takes the appearance of [[Treasure Hoarders: Liuliu]] and fights the same way.
