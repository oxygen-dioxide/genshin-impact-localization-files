{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yingzhu:''' I'm sure we can figure this whole thing out...
::{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Yingzhu:''' Huh, so you weren't paying attention last time, then?
::'''Yingzhu:''' Basically, [[Sumeru Akademiya]] commissioned the Adventurers' Guild to investigate on their behalf, and we found an Irminsul Fruit.
::'''Yingzhu:''' Judging by the scholars' response, it seemed to be an object of major significance for their research.
::'''Yingzhu:''' Unfortunately, there was an incident while we were transporting the Irminsul Fruit, and it blew up. That's the long and short of it.
::'''Yingzhu:''' [[Hosseini]] hasn't stopped moaning and groaning about it ever since. It's giving me a real headache...
::{{DIcon}} What does this mean for the Guild's relations with the Akademiya?
::'''Yingzhu:''' Incidents like this are everyone's worst nightmare. It's damaging for the Guild's reputation, and it will affect our standing with the Akademiya...
::'''Yingzhu:''' *sigh* It's such a mess. We have to find some way of putting everything right...
::'''Yingzhu:''' Traveler, please do make the matter of the Irminsul Fruit fragments and the Energy Amplifier your top priority.
::{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yingzhu:''' We greatly appreciate your ongoing support in this matter, Traveler. Safe travels, and ad astra abyssosque!
