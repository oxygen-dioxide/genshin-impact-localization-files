{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Pinghai:''' Hmm? If you want to go out to sea or catch some fish and stuff, go find another sailor. This boat of mine receives guests bound for the Pearl Galley only.
:{{DIcon}} The Pearl Galley is where I'm bound.
::'''Pinghai:''' Ah, forgive me. So you are to be an honored guest. Come, this way, please.
:{{DIcon}} What's this Pearl Galley you speak of?
::'''Pinghai:''' Well, it's normal to not know.
::'''Pinghai:''' The Pearl Galley is where the wealthy bigwigs of Liyue pass their time. It's no place for plebeians.
::'''Pinghai:''' With the exception of honored guests, any ordinary person who goes onboard will just be there as an onlooker.
::'''Pinghai:''' Well, I've said quite a bit, haven't I? If there's anything else, don't waste more of my time.
:{{DIcon}} I've got nothing.
::'''Pinghai:''' Off with you, then. How dull...
