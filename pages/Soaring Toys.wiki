'''Soaring Toys''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Broken Sea]], [[Simulanka]]. These blocks function as jump pads, and when the player lands or jumps from them, they will be launched higher into the air.

However, only the green side of the Soaring Toy block will launch the player. Groups of multiple Soaring Toy blocks may have their top-facing side alternate between the green side and yellow side when the player jumps from one of them.
