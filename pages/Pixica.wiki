==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pixica:''' Fancy taking on the Floating Target Balloons? No advanced flying techniques required. Anyone can try it out!
:{{DIcon}} Don't I need some kind of flying license or anything?
::'''Pixica:''' No no no, even someone like me, who could never get his flying license, can still complete this with ease.
::'''Pixica:''' Rather than your flying skills, what this tests is your shooting ability.
::'''Pixica:''' The most important thing is to focus! Concentrate single-mindedly on your target.
::'''Pixica:''' Miss Zyanya will ensure your safety throughout your experience, and you'll sometimes even be able to see a [[Qucusaurus]] patrolling nearby!
::'''Pixica:''' Hot air balloons... What a magnificent invention, bringing humanity closer to the skies.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe next time.
::'''Pixica:''' No worries, you're welcome anytime!
