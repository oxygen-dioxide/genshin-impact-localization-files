Hmm, if only bags could walk by themselves."<br />"So Mom said that we could mount a Jumpy Dumpty bouncing pad beneath the bag."<br />"So all we'd need to do is to throw the bag, and it'll go bouncing away!"<br />...<br />Having heard this from [[Klee]], [[Barbara]] once took the bag out of curiosity, lifted it up, and hurled it forwards.<br />And it actually worked, more or less, as intended!<br />Unfortunately, this luggage would become very heavy indeed when filled with things. If allowed to bounce all around [[Mondstadt City]], it might just bust its way through tavern walls, flip dining tables, all the while being very hard for the [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]] to stop. So perhaps it is best left to rest in a room and used as a decoration.
