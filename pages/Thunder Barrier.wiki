'''Thunder Barriers''' are mysterious [[barrier]]s found in [[Inazuma]]. They can only be entered while carrying an [[Electrogranum]], but can be exited freely. Making contact with one while not [[shield]]ed or carrying an Electrogranum will result in the active character being knocked back. Some also contain [[Thunderstone]]s, which deal {{Color|Electro DMG}} over time to players not protected by a shield or Electrogranum. 

Thunder Barriers can have three levels of strength, which can be identified with the symbol on the barrier. Increase your Electrogranum level by increasing the level of [[Sacred Sakura's Favor]] to go through higher strength barriers. Certain mechanisms can also deactivate Thunder Barriers, temporarily or permanently, without needing to increase Electrogranum level.
