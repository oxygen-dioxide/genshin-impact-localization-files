'''Thunder Barriers''' are mysterious [[barrier]]s found in [[Inazuma]]. They can only be traveled through while carrying an [[Electrogranum]].

There are Thunder Barriers of different strengths that can be identified with the symbol on the barrier. Increase the level of the Electrogranum at the [[Sacred Sakura's Favor]] to go through higher strength barriers. Mechanisms can also deactivate Thunder Barriers, either temporarily or permanently, without needing to increase Electrogranum level.

Thunder Barriers can also contain [[Thunderstone]]s that deal {{Color|Electro DMG}} over time to the player if they are not carrying an Electrogranum.

==Barrier Levels==
The more complex the Thunder Barrier symbol, the more powerful Electrogranum you need.
