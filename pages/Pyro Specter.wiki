===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

{{Description|A monster born from highly-concentrated Pyro elements that can float in the air.<br />There was once an [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] student who conducted research into their behavior. He believed that Specters were a form of [[Crystalfly]]; since they both had powers of flight and both were birthed in areas saturated with elemental energy. He has not graduated yet.}}
