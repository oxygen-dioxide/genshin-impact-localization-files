{{Description|A monster born from highly-concentrated Pyro elements that can float in the air.<br />There was once an [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] student who conducted research into their behavior. He believed that Specters were a form of [[Crystalfly]]; since they both had powers of flight and both were birthed in areas saturated with elemental energy. He has not graduated yet.}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Fury:''' Taking high DMG from a single attack will charge Fury. The higher the DMG dealt, the more Fury will be accumulated. When they have a full Fury bar, they will grow bigger and gain access to enhanced attacks.<table class="fandom-table"><tr><th>DMG Taken (%Max HP)</th><th>Fury Accumulated (%)</th></tr><tr><td>18.75-31.25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>31.25-43.75</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>43.75-56.25</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>56.25+</td><td>100</td></tr></table>
*'''Fire Dance:''' Loops around in the air to conjure a fireball which it punts at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.
*'''Sneaky Spitfire:''' Disappears and reappears behind the player, then spits a spray of fire at them, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}.
*'''Pursuing Flamethrower:''' Slowly follows the player while periodically spraying fire at them, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}. This attack will only occur at max Fury and will be the only attack it uses in that state.
*'''Final Burst:''' Explodes after a short pause when defeated, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}. If at max Fury, DMG is increased to '''150% ATK''', and leaves behind a small fireball that explodes after another short pause, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}.

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet all of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.
