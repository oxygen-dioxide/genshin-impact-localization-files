'''Bolai''' {{Lang|zh=博来|zh_rm=Bólái}} is an [[NPC]] in [[Liyue Harbor]]. He can be found under the wharf. He is the owner of [[Wanyou Boutique]], a store that once saw [[Morax]]'s patronage.

His introductory dialogue changes slightly after completing [[Archon Quest]] Chapter 1, Act 2: [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]].

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player four [[Sunsettia]]s.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing Farewell, Archaic Lord)
:'''Bolai:''' Oi! Shhh! Keep your voice down!
;(After completing Farewell, Archaic Lord)
:'''Bolai:''' Shush! Keep your voice down. Now, what can I get you?
::'''Bolai:''' Oh, it's you! Let's get down to business then, what can I get you?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What are you selling?
::'''Bolai:''' *low voice* You're here to view the goods, are you? Hehehe... Good stuff, good stuff...
:;(Opens the Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Why are you acting so shady...
::'''Bolai:''' *low voice* I thought you were in the know... What's with all these questions?
::'''Bolai:''' *low voice* Discretion is key in this line of work...
::'''Bolai:''' *low voice* Come with me...
::'''Bolai:''' *low voice* Fresh sunsettias! Market rates guaranteed...
::{{DIcon}} ...These are all just everyday items, no?
:::'''Bolai:''' *low voice* You got that right! I sell everyday items. What else would I be selling?
:::'''Bolai:''' Haven't you heard the saying, "silence is golden"? Well, if silence is golden, quietness has to be silver at least?
:::'''Bolai:''' *whispering* So when you're doing business, you've got to talk in whispers so the Mora keeps rolling in!
:::'''Bolai:''' *whispering* But you youngsters wouldn't understand, you're easily led astray by wacky ideas...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Sunsettia?
:::'''Bolai:''' Tsk, look, I know they're not much to look at, but these here Sunsettias hold a profound and mysterious secret...
:::'''Bolai:''' ...If you were to try one, then you would know: they're much sweeter than most other Sunsettias.
:::'''Bolai:''' In fact, you can take these ones. Then you'll see I'm telling the truth...
::;(Obtain [[Sunsettia]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Bolai:''' *whispering* You're leaving? At least give me a few words of encouragement if you're not buying...

==Trivia==
*Completing Act I, Part II of Xingqiu's [[Story Quest]] [[Fabulae Textile Chapter]] adds a dialogue option to the Chapter I, Act II [[Archon Quest]] [[Three Poignant Perfumes]], while speaking to Bolai for [[Silk Flower]]s.
*Wanyou Boutique is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Intricately Carved Calligraphy Table]]."
*If you go to Liyue Harbor before starting the [[Rite of Descension]] Archon Quest, Bolai will exist simultaneously near the Main Plaza and beneath the Northern Wharf. The Bolai near the Main Plaza cannot be interacted with.
