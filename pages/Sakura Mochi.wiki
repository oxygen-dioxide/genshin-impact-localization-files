{{Lang|'''Sakura Mochi'''|ja={{Rubi|緋|ひ|櫻|おう|餅|もち}}|ja_rm=Hiou Mochi|ja_tl=Scarlet Sakura Mochi}} is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The recipe for Sakura Mochi can be acquired from Act I of [[Kamisato Ayaka]]'s [[Story Quest]]: [[The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit]], [[With You]].

Depending on the quality, Sakura Mochi revives and restores '''900'''/'''1,200'''/'''1,500''' HP to the target fallen character with a 120-second cooldown. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

When [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]] cooks Sakura Mochi, there is a chance [["Snow on the Hearth"]] will be created instead.

==Trivia==
*{{Lang|{{w|Sakuramochi|Sakura mochi}}|ja=桜餅|ja_lit=cherry rice cake}} is a traditional Japanese confectionary, which is roughly classified into two styles. The one adopted in this game is the Choumei-ji style, also known as the Kantou style ("Eastern Japanese style"), which was invented by the confectionery shop Choumei-ji Sakura Mochi (located in Tokyo) in 1717.
*During the [[Version 1.6]] web event [[Mysterious Voyage]], if the player completed [[Mysterious Voyage/Story#Dance of Sakura Petals|Dance of Sakura Petals]] or [[Mysterious Voyage/Story#What Has Been Entrusted Here?|What Has Been Entrusted Here?]], Sakura Mochi was delivered to the mailbox within the first three days of the [[Version 2.0]] update.
*The following birthday mails included Sakura Mochi:
