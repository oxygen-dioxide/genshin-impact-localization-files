==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List|Sakura Mochi;Suspicious Sakura Mochi;Delicious Sakura Mochi}}
* {{Lang|{{w|Sakuramochi|Sakura mochi}}|ja=桜餅|ja_lit=cherry rice cake}} is a traditional Japanese confectionary, which is roughly classified into two styles. The one adopted in this game is the Choumei-ji style, also known as the Kantou style ("Eastern Japanese style"), which was invented by the confectionery shop Choumei-ji Sakura Mochi (located in Tokyo) in 1717.
* During the [[Version 1.6]] web event [[Mysterious Voyage]], if the player completed [[Mysterious Voyage/Story#Dance of Sakura Petals|Dance of Sakura Petals]] or [[Mysterious Voyage/Story#What Has Been Entrusted Here?|What Has Been Entrusted Here?]], Sakura Mochi was delivered to the mailbox within the first three days of the [[Version 2.0]] update.
