==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Gummer:''' This is the security perimeter of Blackcliff Forge. Please watch what you do.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Blackcliff Forge.
::'''Gummer:''' Interested in the Forge? I'm quite the expert.
::'''Gummer:''' I used to work here, but my body eventually couldn't keep up with the work inside. With little luck, I was able to join the Millelith afterwards.
::'''Gummer:''' In broad strokes, Blackcliff Forge is staffed by miners who smelt ores as they dig tunnels.
::'''Gummer:''' Of course, we also reinforced the tunnels and built factories with safety considerations in mind.
::'''Gummer:''' The bounty that Rex Lapis has bestowed upon Liyue all resides in this mine, and building factories within the mountain itself is the most efficient method of extracting that bounty.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye, then.
::'''Gummer:''' While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
