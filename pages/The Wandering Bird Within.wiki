|description    = A lush Amur Maple crowned with brownish-red leaves, and whose extended branches and leaves very much resemble the migratory wild geese that come flying here from the lands of harsh winter. Though the Amur Maple is a native species to [[Liyue]] that was brought to [[Inazuma]], these trees have taken on unique characteristics due to the soil and water of their new home, as has unique culture grown up around them. The golden-red maple leaves of Liyue represent the harvest to be wealth, and are considered to be auspicious signs. In Inazuma, however, the maple leaves are a melancholy reminder of summer's passing and winter's arrival, and they have become symbols of sorrow often found in poems that tell of old friends missed.
