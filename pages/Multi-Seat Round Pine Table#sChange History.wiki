[[Version 1.6]]
*Outdoor Pine Round Table was renamed to Multi-Seat Round Pine Table
*Description was changed:
** {{Color|Old description:}} A common round table made from the wood of the pine. the people at Good Hunter and other restaurants use them as outdoor seating. Enjoying some fine food as the breeze blows is a most unique experience. The round pine table fears neither searing sun nor driving rain but is conversely terrified of cats that might use it as a scratching post.
** {{Color|New description:}} A Mondstadt-style round pine table that can often be found at restaurants such as Good Hunter. This sort of table fears neither dampness nor hard knocks, but is most afraid of cats that might use it as a scratching post.
