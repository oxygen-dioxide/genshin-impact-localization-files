|description    = A timepiece assemblage placed by the doors of some residences in the [[Vasari Passage]]. It often consists of a desk clock, boxes of parts, and solid lubricants.<br>The residents typically leave their clocks outside to schedule a house call with [[Lepaute Horlogerie]] to repair their broken timepieces while they themselves are busy at work. However, it is quite common for the residents to forget to retrieve their clocks even after they have been repaired...<br>This behavior has caused complaints from other residents who feel rushed and stressed when they encounter a clock while leisurely walking down the street.
