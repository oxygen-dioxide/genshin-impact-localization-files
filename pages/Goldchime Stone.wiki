|description    = A claim originating from the [[Blackcliff Forge]] holds that this giant stone contains a great quantity of gold inside, and that "If you hit it with a hammer, it chimes like a bell." Hence the name, "Goldchime Stone." The more ubiquitous theory is that it is no different from any other stone.<br />An investigation by the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] found that the source of the rumor was a work song written by miners to boost their morale. Somewhere along the line, the song's meaning was misconstrued and many people ended up believing the lyrics to be true.
