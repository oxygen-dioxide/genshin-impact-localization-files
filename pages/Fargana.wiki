{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Fargana:''' The clouds are like picture frames in the sky...
:'''Fargana:''' If I had wisdom to rival the gods, could I, too, draw pictures in the sky?
:{{DIcon}} Hello...?
::'''Fargana:''' Hmm... No, I doubt it.
::'''Fargana:''' The heavens are above the gods, and the stars are above the heavens...
::'''Fargana:''' ...Nothing is truly omnipotent.
:{{DIcon}} (There's no getting through to this person... Never mind.)
::'''Fargana:''' ...
{{Dialogue end}}
===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Fargana:''' Hello there. Did Setaria send you over?
:{{DIcon}} Setaria?
::'''Fargana:''' Huh?
::'''Fargana:''' ...Hmm, my bad. I've only recently returned to the Akademiya from Aaru Village, so very few people speak to me. I  subconsciously assumed that you're one of Setaria's friends.
::{{DIcon}} Aaru Village, you say...
::'''Fargana:''' That's right. I was previously one of the Village Keepers... That's what the villagers told me, anyway.
::'''Fargana:''' Village Keepers are researchers who have been exiled to Aaru Village. But in truth, I don't really remember what I did there.
::'''Fargana:''' It's almost like I had a dream that I no longer remembered once I awoke... and yet my mind is still quite clear.
::'''Fargana:''' Later, a lady named Setaria helped me settle some procedures that would let me return to the Akademiya. Honestly, it was a lot of procedures indeed, so I'm quite thankful for her help.
::'''Fargana:''' She should be busy here with her work as an educator at the moment. I plan on helping her to look for some necessary materials, such as books about basic infrastructure...
::'''Fargana:''' Once I've finished settling those things, I'll contact her again.
:{{DIcon}} I think you've got the wrong person.
::'''Fargana:''' Ah! Um, sorry about that! I presumed too much...
