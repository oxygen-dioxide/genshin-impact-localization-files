|desc_suspicious = There must have been some miscalculation in the amount of ingredients to use, as this just tastes like a bowl of overly sweet rice. Well, time to grab some plain drink and scarf it down...
|desc_basic      = After cooking the rice beforehand, it is placed into a pot together with the other ingredients, stirred evenly, and steamed. The mouthfeel is fragrant and soft, a perfect denouement to any meal.
|desc_delicious  = The soft, sticky rice and the sweet milk have melded together perfectly, their tastes complementing each other. If you eat it hot, you can enjoy the dense rice grains, and if you leave it till it's cold, you can savor the gentle fragrance of milk &mdash; each possessing its own beauty. People who eat such a dish cannot help but wonder: how many experiments led up to this moment?
