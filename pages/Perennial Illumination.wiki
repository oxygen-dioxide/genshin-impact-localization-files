|description    = Street lamps seen everywhere in [[Sumeru City]]. Using the Self-Modulating Light Source designed by [[Kshahrewar]] scholars, it can maintain optimal illumination for an extended period with minimal need for replenishing the luminescent materials. The lamp and the lamppost are metallic, supposedly made when the [[Akademiya]] was processing extra ores. Thankfully, most [[Sumeru]] residents won't be strongly repulsed by metallic items as long as they aren't carried around on their person.
