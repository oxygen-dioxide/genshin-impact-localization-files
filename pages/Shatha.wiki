{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shatha:''' Hello there. It's getting late, so I suggest that you return home to rest.
:{{DIcon}} What about you?
::'''Shatha:''' Me? Well, this might be the first time you've seen me on the night shift, so let me fill you in.
::'''Shatha:''' Previously, we had a series of incidents in which Village Keepers were kidnapped, so the village head has added a few additional people to our patrols. Guess who's one of the lucky people?
::{{DIcon}} So, about those kidnappings...
::'''Shatha:''' I heard that they had something to do with the [[Akademiya]]... Hmph, even when I was working in the city as a mercenary in the [[Corps of Thirty]], I had already seen right through them.
::'''Shatha:''' Those wretched scholars are even more disgusting than those [[Specters]] that blow up before disappearing. There's no end to their corrupt schemes.
::'''Shatha:''' Not that those idiots who think that "[[King Deshret]] has risen" or some nonsense like that are any better.
::'''Shatha:''' I can't believe I worked with some of those idiots back when I was a mercenary.
:{{DIcon}} Ah, I get it.
::'''Shatha:''' And it's good that you do. Take care of yourself now. You can't be sure what will happen to you at night.
