{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Gama)
:'''Gama:''' Just as I was leaving the place, I was caught by this machine. I mean, how unlucky can a person get?

;(Talk to Gama if the chests were not previously found)
:'''Gama:''' Help! Help me!
:'''Gama:''' I heard that our leaders were struggling to cope with Supada no Hiko's rebellion, and that the Dainichi Mikoshi was undefended, so I got to thinking a thought that I shouldn't have...
:'''Gama:''' Please, good warden, please spare my unworthy life! I have a sickly mother to feed and 12 orphans to bring up! Please have mercy, treat me as but a mere fart to be ignored!
:{{DIcon}} Ahem...
:'''Gama:''' Eh? Oh, so you're not one of the guards around the Dainichi Mikoshi.
:'''Gama:''' By the looks of your unusual garments... Might you be someone in the same line of work as me &mdash; you know, just from someplace else?
:'''Paimon:''' Who'd want to be in your line of work!?
:'''Gama:''' Oh, come now, there's no need to play pretend. *sigh* I must be the unluckiest person ever. It took me so much effort to get into the Dainichi Mikoshi, and just as I was planning to make a real fortune... I wound up being caught in a mechanical trap.
:'''Gama:''' I guess this just isn't the day for "robbing the rich to pay the poor."
:'''Paimon:''' Bah, call a spade a spade, call a thief a thief!
:'''Gama:''' And what would you know about that? The big shots listen to decadent music, eat well, and drink lavishly, while we bottom-dwellers work ourselves to the bone tossing out their chamber pots and warming their sandals! Where's the logic in that?
:'''Gama:''' Let me tell you a secret &mdash; consider it repayment for saving my life. I gave the artisans maintaining this place a little something to loosen their tongues, and they told me that there are two more rooms in this place that are used to store treasure.
:'''Paimon:''' Two more!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, uh, {{Traveler}}, what say you and Paimon do some "robbing the rich to pay the poor" ourselves, eh?
:'''Gama:''' However, I don't know where these rooms are. Those artisans didn't dare to tell me anything more.
:'''Gama:''' Consider that intel my gift to you!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, no one's in Enkanomiya right now, so let's go see what ancient relics we can find in those rooms, shall we?
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, {{Traveler}}, let's have a little sneaky look around!
