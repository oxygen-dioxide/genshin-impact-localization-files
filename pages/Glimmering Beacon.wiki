'''Glimmering Beacons''' are objects that appear on water in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]] that light up the area. They can be located on the map and will pulse when sailing near them on the [[Waverider]]. When reaching a beacon, they will be activated and light up.

They can be found at the {{Icon|Glimmering Beacon|30}} Glimmering Beacon on the [[minimap]].
