==Description==
In the distant past, when the gods and spirits walked the land,<br>
When all the land was in turmoil, people must have asked such questions...<br>
"Please tell me: where have my lover and children gone?"<br>
"When will those who have departed return to us?"<br>
"O great lord, how long will these horrific times persist?"

Even the hearts of people hewn from the hardest bedrock would crack and break from the pain.<br>
Even the eyes of those who remained silent, stoic in their unswerving faith in their gods, would begin to smolder.<br>
Even if they did not ask such questions, their hearts would make the sounds.

[[Morax|The ruler of Geo]] thus put forth his might and carved a long blade from a pure slab of golden [[Cor Lapis]].<br>
With a single slice, he cut a corner clean off a mountain, and upon it he swore a most solemn oath to the people&mdash;<br>
Those scattered, he would gather &mdash; and those who broke the contract, he would punish.<br>
Those who had lost their loved ones, those robbed of their possessions, those deprived of justice &mdash; they would receive recompense.

Perhaps this is but one of the many tales that shroud the ancient land of Liyue.<br>
But the solemn oath that Rex Lapis swore is nonetheless at work within it.<br>
To break a contract is to make an enemy of this land where gods once ruled,<br>
And sooner or later, the mountain Rex Lapis cut will fall upon those who break contracts&mdash;

A legend still circulates, saying that this weapon's true owner will one day return to walk among mortals.<br>
Then, this sword will once again gleam gold, and its light will cut through the greatest of this world's injustices...<br>
Just as it did when Rex Lapis made his solemn oath before the people.
