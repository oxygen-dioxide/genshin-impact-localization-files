==Lore==
According to legend, Hanan Pacha was created when [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]] and his disciple [[Chaac]] raised a tract of land into the sky. Upon this floating island, they shared the knowledge of [[Phlogiston]] with those who passed their trials. Eventually, these people formed the first human tribe.<ref name="RHP" />

In the present day, the Upper Sanctum is no longer a whole island, but a ring of smaller islands. It can only be accessed by activating a [[Spiritway]]. The mechanisms for the ancient trials, a series of Spiritways and Iridescent Inscriptions, are still intact. In ''[[Seeker No Finding]]'', the [[Traveler]] completed the trials, revealing a hidden center island with a Phlogiston hot spring. According to Chikya, a hero acknowledged by the trials could gain the power to wield Phlogiston by soaking in said spring. Since the Traveler could already manipulate Phlogiston, it had no effect on them.

==Trivia==
* According to Chikya, it is called the "Upper Sanctum" due to its inaccessibility by either humans or Saurians.<ref name="Tracer"/>
* [[Peach Palm Wood]] is found exclusively in the Upper Sanctum.
* It is also possible to reach the Upper Sanctum using a geyser pillar center south of the [[Toyac Springs]] area and a flying character like Xianyun, followed by a Natlan character like Kinich.
===Etymology===
* In {{W|Inca mythology}}, ''Hanan Pacha'' (lit. "upper ''pacha''") refers to the {{W|Pacha (Inca mythology)|realm}} that includes the sky, the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, and constellations. It is somewhat analogous to "heaven."
