''Available after completing ''Masquerade of the Guilty''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Rege:''' ...Hi, do you need any help?
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Rege:''' Haha... Guess I must look pretty bad, eh?
::'''Rege:''' There are too many things to do in town these days which require strenuous labor. I'm a little beat, so I'm just taking a rest.
::'''Rege:''' I used to have someone to talk to when taking a break, but now... Forget it, best not to think about that.
:{{DIcon}} I'm okay. You take care of yourself.
::'''Rege:''' Eh, fine.

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Rege:''' Hello. Would you like to chat?
:{{DIcon}} Sure. Anything you want to talk about?
::'''Rege:''' Hmm... I've been so caught up with the town's reconstruction work that I've been blind and deaf to everything else...
::'''Rege:''' But now that I'm free, I find myself disinterested in gossip and the like.
::'''Rege:''' I should find something to do and keep myself busy. It's the only way to keep my thoughts from running wild.
::'''Rege:''' It would be nice to sail across the ocean to somewhere else or get some other new hobby.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Rege:''' It's fine, go ahead.
