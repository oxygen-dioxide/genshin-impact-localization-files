:'''Manaia:''' You can't just drink this water whenever you want! It doesn't matter if you're a [[Saurian]], or very good at swimming!
:{{DIcon}} Hot spring water's not suitable for drinking.
::'''Manaia:''' See, the Traveler agrees!
::'''Manaia:''' I recorded my experiences here and sent them back by mail. In his reply, Monsieur [[Neuvillette]] urged me to wait for the hot spring water to cool before tasting it for myself.
::'''Manaia:''' But Monsieur Neuvillette... Why would anyone want to taste hot spring water at all?
:{{DIcon}} I'll keep that in mind.
::'''Manaia:''' Mhm! Not only is the water here too hot, it's also bad for your stomach.
