==Pre-Quest Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Touch the ancient mechanism by the entrance before obtaining [[Cocouik]]'s power, optional)
:'''Ancient Mechanism:''' (The ancient mechanism remains still. A strong odor of the [[Abyss]] lingers around it...)

;(Approach the golden barrier by the entrance before obtaining Cocouik's power, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Gah, {{Traveler}}! The Abyssal energy ahead is so strong! Let's think of some way to clear out the energy around here before we continue exploring.

;(Drop down one level, to the Winding Ancient Road)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, it's really cool down here! Paimon didn't think there'd be this much space either...

;(Drop down another level, to the Buried Underground Ruins)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, how deep does this place go? And what sorta person would dig all the way down here? Paimon's kinda curious...

;(While solving the puzzle at the west end of the Buried Underground Ruins)
:;(Start the mechanism)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, it’s one of those weird devices... It’s pulled up the chest from underwater...

:;(Release the mechanism before placing a board, optional)
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, it fell back down again... If only there was something to hold the chest in place...

:;(Start the mechanism while a board is in place, optional)
::'''Paimon:''' Uhh... That board is blocking the chest. Maybe we should try sucking up the chest first?

:;(Complete the puzzle)
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that’s right! Great job!

;(Reach the centre of the Buried Underground Ruins)
:'''{{Little One}}''': Rawr, rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, don’t run off, {{Little One}}! It’s really dark here!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait... It looks like these are marks left by someone...

;(Approach the [[Teleport Waypoint]] at the west end of the Buried Underground Ruins)
:'''???:''' ...Chosen of... Noble one...

;(Approach the central cavern)
:'''???:''' ...Ye... Honored... Pay respects...

;(Approach the small dragon statue)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, look, {{Traveler}}! This statue seems to have a weird groove on it...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr, rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh? Is there something that’s really caught your eye, {{Little One}}?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, it seems like he’s saying “Follow me!”... Maybe we should follow him and take a look?

;(Interact with the statue, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' What could this groove be for...? C’mon, {{Traveler}}, let’s follow {{Little One}} over there and have a look. Maybe there’s something good waiting for us there!

;(Approach the Ancient Flint Key)
:{{Tutorial|Strange Mechanism Components...}}

;(Pick up the Ancient Flint Key)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Ancient Flint Key}})
:'''Paimon:''' Careful! These Secret Source Automatons still work!

;(After defeating {{Enemy|Secret Source Automaton: Hunter-Seeker|x=2}})
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, that did it! Though, doesn’t this key that {{Little One}} found look like it matches that groove in the statue exactly?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, he sure looks happy! Anyway, let's find a way out of here first, starting by heading back to the statue!

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the giant statue)
:'''Paimon:''' What a strange statue. It looks like... a dragon?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr, rawr!

;(Interact with the investigation point)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, look, a shiny gem! Hang on. It doesn't look like a rock. More like a... shard of metal?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's take it with us anyway, {{Traveler}}. Never know if it'll turn out to be a valuable treasure, eh?
;(Obtain {{Item|Ancient Jadestone Fragment}})

;(Insert the key into the mechanism)
:'''Paimon:''' The water level's dropped again. Looks like we can keep going now!

;(Interact with the investigation point)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. This fragment's very similar to the one before... It doesn't look artificial, though. What could it have been used for?
;(Obtain {{Item|Ancient Jadestone Fragment}})

;(Enter the central cavern)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, didn't expect the statue to be this huge... Who carved this thing, anyway?
:'''???:''' ...O Noble one, Chosen of Dragons... Step forward...

;(Approach the strange crystal in front of the barrier)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, this place seems to have been locked down by the strange rock over there...
:{{Tutorial|Sealed Flamecrystals}}

;(Approach the mechanism)
:'''Paimon:''' Ohh, this isn't endless, is it...
:'''Paimon:''' I&mdash;It's so dark in here... R&mdash;Remember to stick close, {{Traveler}}!

;(Insert the key into the mechanism)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, guess we just need to insert the key into the statue, just like before, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, don't you think it's super quiet here? No strange mechanical monsters around the statue and stuff... This place is so different from other parts of Ochkanatlan...
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Abyssal monsters! Why'd they just pop out all of a sudden!?

;(Enter the central cavern)
:'''???:''' ...O Noble one, Chosen of Dragons... Step forward and hear my words...

;(Interact with the investigation point)
:'''Paimon:''' And another identical fragment... Ugh, come on, we can't put them together at all!
;(Obtain {{Item|Ancient Jadestone Fragment}})

;(Approach the center of the platform)
:'''???:''' The sovereign ruler of the Land of {{Rubi|Seven|Chichen Uctokah}} Flames extends salutations unto you, chosen one. May your path be one paved with flowers that shall never wither.
:'''Paimon:''' That voice... Sounds like it came from this... big statue.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:{{DIcon}} "Chosen one"? You mean me?
::'''???:''' Indeed. Chosen of Dragons you are, and noble elect of mine also.
:'''Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L:''' [[Dragonlord]] {{Rubi|Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L|Type-L Self-Regulating Overseer Array Integrated Processing Unit}} is my name, aforetime the ruler of Chichen Uctokah.

;({{Cx}})<!--After completing "Revelations From the Past"?-->
::'''Paimon:''' Ixu... What's your name now? Sure that's something you call yourself, and not some kind of mumbo-jumbo spell?
;({{Cx}})
::'''Paimon:''' Ixu... What's your name now? Sure that's something you call yourself, and not some crazy spell?
:'''Paimon:''' Whatever, Paimon's gonna call you "Ixlel." That'll do. Not like she'll remember the rest anyway!
:'''Ixlel:''' According to the sacred {{Rubi|destined|K'uhul}} path hath ye and those with ye... No, wait! What did you name me, you white, round, elemental floating object!?
:'''Paimon:''' And who are you calling a "white, round, elemental floating object"!? Paimon's the name, this is {{Traveler}}, and...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rraaar!
:{{DIcon}} And this is {{Little One}}.
:'''Paimon:''' Also, you're the one who called yourself "Ix-whachamacallitagain-lel," or whatever, didn't you?
:'''Ixlel:''' S&mdash;Such impertinence! This sacred name comes from the most glorious of rulers. How dare this white, round, elemental floating object speak thus, and vastly overstep its station!
:'''Ixlel:''' Noble {{Traveler}}! Forgive my blunt speech, but surely you grant your servant gross latitude, that it should address a sovereign ruler thusly!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon is not my servant.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmph, that's right! We're the best of friends!
::'''Ixlel:''' You... friends with an elemental floating object? A... unique choice, I must confess.
:{{DIcon}} Well said. Now then, Mini Pie, I must have words with thee...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey! Who's "Mini Pie," huh? Don't get ahead of yourself over some flattery, you hear?
:'''Ixlel:''' In any case, do accept my apologies, noble {{Traveler}}. You have sojourned far to reach this place, and yet this all-too-humiliating form is all I can display before you.
:'''Ixlel:''' Did this despicable statue not entrap me, I would surely have presented myself to you in a more elegant fashion, whether it be in a Dragonlord's form, or a mortal's guise...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, so you're stuck in there?
:'''Ixlel:''' Hmph. And you have reason to think otherwise? Think me a mere talking statue, do you?
:'''Paimon:''' But... this is the sorta place where "a mere talking statue" wouldn't be too out of place, don'cha think?
:'''Ixlel:''' Gah. You insolent creature! I am the sovereign ruler of Chichen Uctokah, a great and glorious Dragonlord... You dare... You dare...!
:'''Ixlel:''' If not for that most despised of betrayals, I would never have been trapped in this crude carving!
:'''Ixlel:''' B&mdash;But anyway! Noble {{Traveler}}, let me cut this long story short &mdash; I am in need of your aid.
:{{DIcon}} In what matter?
:{{DIcon}} For what reward?
::'''Ixlel:''' Haha. Fret not. Once I am done speaking, you shall know your reward's value.
:'''Ixlel:''' My heart was once ripped apart through betrayal, before being hidden in various devices. I would ask you to seek those shards for me. Once that is done...
:'''Ixlel:''' Cut my chest open as you would peel Grainfruit leaves, and dig my heart out.
:'''Paimon:''' Sure... Uh, wait a minute. You just said something super scary so casually...
:'''Ixlel:''' Scary? You mean the Grainfruit? How chicken-hearted you are, elemental floating object...
:'''Paimon:''' What? What are you talking about? Who'd be afraid of Grainfruit anyway? Paimon's talking about that last part, with the whole "dig out your heart" thing!
:'''Ixlel:''' Hmm? Is that not a more pedestrian thing than Grainfruit? Ah, Noble {{Traveler}}, do you not have your servants attend you as you partake in sacrifices?
:{{DIcon}} Why do you want your heart to be dug out?
:'''Ixlel:''' For you are the noble one, the Chosen of Dragons. Apart from our lost colleagues in {{Rubi|rulership|Ajaw}}, you alone have the right to give unto me release befitting of my rank.
:'''Ixlel:''' If you are familiar with the ancient ways, O Noble {{Traveler}}, surely you must know that my {{Rubi|heart|Clustered Storage Array}}, created as it was in great antiquity, holds all the memories that were once mine.
:'''Ixlel:''' The traitor &mdash; may his name be cast into the everlasting flames to burn for thirteen thousand years! &mdash; stole my authority, using memories to entrap me here.
:'''Paimon:''' What? Can memories be used to restrain peopl&mdash; Err, Dragons?
:'''Ixlel:''' Hmph. So ignorant are you that it is quite adorable, elemental floating object. Had my authority not been lost, I might yet have taken you in as a pet.
:'''Ixlel:''' For mayfly-races, memories are naturally as sweet and lovely as Quenepa Berries, but for long-lived species, memories are naught but curses and shackles.
:'''Paimon:''' That's... not easy to understand...
:'''Ixlel:''' Whatever the case may be, it was this means by which that wretched renegade forced me to sing for his empire, and for his delusions &mdash; for he did not know how to operate this city.
:'''Ixlel:''' His pitiful empire and his laughable delusions were both reduced to ash. Yet, here I remain still, imprisoned in this miserable effigy.
:'''Paimon:''' Um, even if you say so, it still feels strange to find your heart, only to dig it out again...
:'''Ixlel:''' Heh... Still you do not comprehend, you white, round, elemental floating object?
:'''Ixlel:''' My life's thread is all but spun out. And even were that not so, my consciousness shall also be utterly depleted in thirty winters.
:'''Ixlel:''' My dignity permits me not to die enslaved or confined! Therefore, noble {{Traveler}}, I beg of you, grant me release.
:'''Ixlel:''' I cannot destroy myself, but should you retrieve those fragments, I can pour what remains of my {{Rubi|life|Energy}} into them, restoring my broken heart to its original state.
:'''Ixlel:''' This is a step of {{Color|buzzword|self-protection}}, and only by this may I not violate the {{Rubi|destined|K'uhul}}, sacred law.
:'''Ixlel:''' After that, dig my heart out. It is this heart that binds me, that enslaves me, that has tormented me endlessly all these millennia.
:'''Ixlel:''' It is the true heart of a Dragonlord, before which all of humanity's gems must shy away in shame. And it shall be your reward &mdash; what say you?
;(If all 3 Ancient Jadestone Fragments have not been collected)
::{{DIcon}} I understand.
:::'''Ixlel:''' You have my thanks. Then, let me sing here, and wait for good tidings from you. Little else can I do now, I fear.
:::'''Ixlel:''' Please... find my heart, and grant me noble relief.
::{{DIcon}} Is there no other way?
:::'''Ixlel:''' Hehe... It seems you have yet to meet my colleagues of old.
:::'''Ixlel:''' Otherwise, they would have told you that destruction is our {{Rubi|destined|K'uhul}} path. There is no need for another, nor is it possible to find one.
:::'''Ixlel:''' Regardless, I will sing here and await your decision.

::;(Stand on the central platform)
:::'''Paimon:''' Aha, found it! Just one fragment left!

::;(Pick up the final fragment)
:::'''Paimon:''' This should be the last fragment! Shall we go back to Ixlel, {{Traveler}}?
<!--Any dialogue if the player picks up the first or second fragment at this point?-->

;(If all 3 Ancient Jadestone Fragments have been collected)
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, when you say "heart," you mean...
::{{Black Screen|You show Ixlel the peculiar fragments you found...}}
::'''Ixlel:''' Th&mdash;These are... Yes. Yes! These are the ones!
::'''Ixlel:''' To think that you have already collected all these fragments! Now then, noble {{Traveler}}, please dig my heart out, and let me perish at your hand!
::'''Ixlel:''' Rejoice also, white, round, elemental floating object! For I shall bestow upon you too the honor of witnessing the passing of Chichen Uctokah's ruler!
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa, don't get so excited about this stuff, would ya? Anyway, we just need to put these components in first, right?
::'''Ixlel:''' Indeed, indeed! Come now, I shall open my heart to you. Take it out, and this task shall be done!
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, do you really have to put it that way?
::{{DIcon}} (Insert the fragments.)
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, and then...
::;(Submit {{Item|Ancient Jadestone Fragment|x=3}})
:;(Continue to next section)

;(Talk to Ixlel again, if all fragments were not found or item submission was cancelled)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Ixlel! We've found the bits and bobs you need!
:'''Ixlel:''' Wh&mdash;Who do you name "Ixlel," you insolent whelp? I've told you, my name is...
:'''Ixlel:''' Alright, never mind! I tire of waiting to die! Come, noble {{Traveler}}, put ye these into my chest...
:'''Ixlel:''' And then dig out my heart, and allow me to perish by your noble hands!
:'''Ixlel:''' Rejoice thou also, O white, round, elemental floating object! For I shall bestow upon you too the honor of witnessing the passing of Chichen Uctokah's ruler!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, don't get so excited about this stuff, would ya? Anyway, we just need to put these components in first, right?
:'''Ixlel:''' Indeed, indeed! Come now, I shall open my heart to you. Take it out, and this task shall be done!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, do you really have to put it that way?
:{{DIcon}} (Insert the components.)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, and then...
:;(Submit {{Item|Ancient Jadestone Fragment|x=3}})
----
;(After inserting the fragments)
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What is this!?
:'''Ixlel:''' Och-Kan... Och-Kan! You despicable beast! You vicious viper! You filthy, traitorous insect! Will you not even let me pass on in peace, you mongrel!?
:'''Ixlel:''' ...Apologies, {{Traveler}}. Please, help me one last time and cut these chains that bind my consciousness, that prevent me from... opening my heart to you...

;(After destroying the chain on the first level)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew. That's the chains on the first floor severed! Let's keep on going and take care of the rest!
:'''Ixlel:''' O tides, I bid you hearken &mdash; hear now the final edict of the Land of Seven Flames' sovereign ruler...
:'''Ixlel:''' Topple these long-destroyed halls, for the sake of these puny humans, and for our honor also.

;(After destroying the chains on the second level)
:'''Paimon:''' One last floor left! Still, these seals seem pretty crude... is it because they're so old?
:'''Ixlel:''' {{Traveler}}... Please, be wary! From what I know of the traitor, such seals are far too simple &mdash; abnormally so, in fact...

;(While evading the attacks)
:'''Paimon:''' Agh! Where did these Secret Source platforms come from this time!?
:'''Ixlel:''' Be careful, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Ixlel:''' I understand. Since these are parasites upon my person and life, I merely need to accelerate consumption, and...
<!--If your indwelled Koholasaur dies at this point, the game just progresses anyway; is this true if you die earlier?-->

;(At the end of the attacks)
:'''Ixlel:''' Hmm. It would seem that these toys have run dry as well...

;(After destroying the chains on the third level)
:'''Ixlel:''' Next, {{Traveler}}... You need only... Take my... heart...
:'''Ixlel:''' Thank you... for granting me...

;(Interact with the heart)
:'''Paimon:''' Um, Ixlel? You there?
:'''Statue:''' (The will imprisoned within the statue has dissipated. Silence alone answers you.)
;(Obtain {{Item|Perfect Heart of the Sacred Dragon}})

;(After the water level falls)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That door over there... Why'd it suddenly open?
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* A Remarkable Chest containing the [[Furnishing Blueprint]] for [[Phlogiston Street Lamp: The Road Ahead]] is hidden beneath the rising Secret Source platform in the Ancient Ruins Walkway.
* It is actually quite difficult to die as an [[Saurian Indwelling|indwelled]] [[Koholasaurus]] during the Secret Sentinel attack phase.
