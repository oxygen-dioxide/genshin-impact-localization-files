{{Description|"Baizhu's familiarity with the medicinal effects of common herbs is useful knowledge during medical emergencies in the wild."|2=[[Dainsleif]] in [https://youtu.be/Av4gbEYYZmM Collected Miscellany - "Baizhu: Opportune Remedies"]}}
'''Herbal Nourishment''' is [[Baizhu]]'s [[Utility Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The healing effect will also trigger upon harvesting an item with [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]].
* The following actions do not trigger the healing effect:
** Activating [[Whopperflower]]s disguised as regular plants
** Picking up [[Quest Item]]s with an identical appearance to harvestable resources, such as [[Fresh Qingxin]]
** Picking up any items spawned by player activity, such as [[Mushroom]]s dropped by [[Shroomboar]]s, [[Apple]]s from [[Investigation]] points and crates, and flora [[Gardening|planted]] in fields in the [[Serenitea Pot]]
** Obtaining [[Gardening Materials]] via the [[Seed Dispensary]] gadget; the healing effect is only calculated for the open world resource that was harvested
** Harvesting [[Romaritime Flower]]s
