|description    = A [[Teleport Waypoint]] created using [[Sub-Space Creation]]. You can use this waypoint to travel from place to place in your Realm.<br />This kind of waypoint bathes in the Realm's [[Adeptal Energy|adeptal energy]], and will not lose function over time. However, [[Tubby]] says that putting too many of these waypoints in might throw adeptal energy in the realm into disarray, which can cause her massive insomnia. And if she gets insomnia, the following things could happen: buildings could end up in the wrong places, trees might go flying into the sky, the mountains and stones may twist and turn... Either way, it's best that you not put too many waypoints in your teapot.

'''Sub-Space Waypoint''' or '''Realm Waypoint''' is a purchasable [[Furnishing]] that can be used to like a [[Teleport Waypoint]] in the [[Serenitea Pot]]. A maximum of 10 can be purchased from the [[Realm Depot]] for {{Item|Realm Currency|30|x=100}} each.

==Note==
*Placing a Realm Waypoint in the Serenitea Pot for the first time grants the ''[[A Realm Beyond: Series III]]'' achievement "[[Just Like a Game of Chess]]."
*Payers can teleport to a Sub-Space Waypoint even from outside the Serenitea Pot, making them an alternative to placing down their Serenitea Pot from their inventory and interacting with it to enter the teapot.
*Once used, the empty gap in the hitbox is where the character will teleport to.
