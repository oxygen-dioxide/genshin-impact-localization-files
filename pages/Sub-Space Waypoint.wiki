|description    = A [[Teleport Waypoint]] created using [[Sub-Space Creation]]. You can use this waypoint to travel from place to place in your Realm.<br>This kind of waypoint bathes in the Realm's [[Adeptal Energy|adeptal energy]], and will not lose function over time. However, [[Tubby]] says that putting too many of these waypoints in might throw the adeptal energy in the realm into disarray, which can cause her massive insomnia. And if she gets insomnia, the following things could happen: buildings could end up in the wrong places, trees might go flying into the sky, the mountains and stones may twist and turn...<br>Either way, it's best that you not put too many waypoints in your teapot.

==Notes==
* Placing a Realm Waypoint in the Serenitea Pot for the first time grants the ''[[A Realm Beyond: Series III]]'' achievement ''[[Just Like a Game of Chess]]''.
* Players can teleport to a Sub-Space Waypoint even from outside the Serenitea Pot, making them an alternative to placing down their Serenitea Pot from their inventory and interacting with it to enter the teapot.
* Once used, the empty gap in the hitbox is where the character will teleport to.
