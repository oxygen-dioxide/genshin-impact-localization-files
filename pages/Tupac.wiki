'''Tupac''' was a historical figure from the [[People of the Springs]] in [[Natlan]], and was one of the [[Heroes of Natlan|six warriors]] who joined forces with [[Tenoch]] in a war against the Abyss.<ref name="TS">{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref> He makes his first appearance in the form of a spiritual projection in the {{Quest|Into Eternal Night}}.

Tupac bore the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name|UMJ|'''Umoja'''|bearer=1}}, which has since been inherited in the present-day by [[Mualani]]. Although it is unclear if Tupac possessed a vision, he was shown to have the ability to control the {{Hydro}} element.<ref name="Sunset">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/aGtkhL8gDYE "Sunset" Animated Short]</ref>

==Profile==
Tupac was a descendant of Uenuku and warrior of the People of the Springs.

Tupac was known to be skilled at a variety of weapons. He has been shown wielding a hammer in battle, and has been known to wield the [[Catalyst]] [[Waveriding Whirl]]. The Catalyst [[Ash-Graven Drinking Horn]] also belonged to him, but was not used in battle.

In the final battle against the [[Abyss]], where Tupac fought alongside [[Menilek]], [[Sundjatta]], [[Wanjiru]] and [[Mavuika]], he
suffered serious wounds, but clung to his life long enough after the battle to bring Mavuika to the [[Sacred Flame]] before succumbing to his wounds. The other three had already perished during that battle.<ref name="Sunset" />

===Appearance===
Befitting his title as '''Giant''', Tupac is an extremely tall individual, towering several times taller than most people, to the point where no Saurian was able to carry him. Only tables could act as chairs in order to comfortably seat him. He wears armor and carries a giant hammer on his back. He has been described as having many scars on his body from various people that had challenged him in combat, notably including his rival Tenoch.

When he manifested to Mualani in the Night Kingdom, he appeared as a dark form with a shining golden aura. The characters of his Ancient Name, '''Umoja''', glowed on his chest.

==Story==
Tupac was a heroic figure, said to have performed several great feats such as thrusting rocks into the earth to make hot springs bubble up and single-handedly doing battle with a giant two-tailed whale. Tupac also battled [[Tenoch]] in his youth, and the two formed a great rivalry.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Ash-Graven Drinking Horn}}</ref>

Many years later, after Tenoch's expulsion from the tribes, Tenoch would visit Tupac to ask for his assistance in combating the invasion of the Abyss, as the last member to join his party. The two would take a moment to observe their respective scars before bursting into laughter and joining hands and forces. He survived the battle against Abyss and lived long enough to bring [[Mavuika]] to the Sacred Flame before succumbing to his wounds.<ref name="Sunset" /> To his final breath, Tupac was said to have not betrayed his oath.<ref name="TS" />

500 years after his death, after [[Mualani]]'s party entered the Night Kingdom, found Kachina and fought off an Abyss Lector, Tupac manifested from a projection of her Ancient Name, which they shared and Mualani now bore. He noted Mualani must have fully embodied their Wayob's aspirations due to awakening his words, and informed her that, in line with her Ancient Name '''Umoja''', meaning 'Unity', she would unite the tribes and save Natlan. Following that, the two bumped fists and Tupac disappeared, his memories, especially those concerning [[Mavuika]]'s plan, transferred to Mualani.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Into Eternal Night}}</ref>
