===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available near the [[Pyro Regisvine]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ranjit:''' Shall we begin?
:{{DIcon|Specially-Shaped Saurian Search}} Let's.
:{{DIcon}} Just how are Pyro Regisvines and Natlan's [[Saurian]]s alike?
::'''Ranjit:''' ...Haha, I'm sure you didn't know this, but [[Natlan]] is home to [[Qucusaurus|fire-breathing Saurians]]! That excessive amount of Pyro on your skin... Now that's the flavor of Natlan for you!
::'''Ranjit:''' So that's the plan. I mean, the first step of any challenge should be starting on a lower difficulty, wouldn't you say?
::'''Ranjit:''' A Pyro Regisvine neither dodges nor hides, and you don't have to search for it or worry that it might escape. There could be no subject more suitable.
::'''Ranjit:''' And even if negotiations with it fall through, its fruit will still make for a good ingredient for some creative cooking...
:{{DIcon}} Now that you mention it, I haven't met a single person from Natlan...
::'''Ranjit:''' Well, about that... They have a lot of reservations about leaving their land... Which I don't feel comfortable talking about as a foreigner.
::'''Ranjit:''' I'm not too sure about their rules and taboos, but I doubt that it's the unfamiliar environments that are the problem, haha.
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to handle. See you around.
::'''Ranjit:''' No worries. I'll wait for you here.

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available near the [[Primo Geovishap]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ranjit:''' Shall we head down, then?
:{{DIcon|Specially-Shaped Saurian Search}} Let's go.
:{{DIcon}} By the way, how exactly are we going to eat the Pyro Regisvine fruit?
::'''Ranjit:''' Well, we're out in the wild, so simple works best. First, we'll need to trim the fruit's shape without getting burned.
::'''Ranjit:''' Next, we cut off a small piece, dig a groove into the middle of the fruit, then put in a couple chunks of butter, [[Whopperflower]] Nectar, and your preferred spices. Then we roast &mdash; all done.
::'''Ranjit:''' I'd say that Pyro Regisvine's fruit has a more striking flavor than that of apples. Really sears itself into your memories...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the [[Tepetlisauri]]...
::'''Ranjit:''' Oh, the little ones are awfully cute! What with their big round eyes and roly-poly bellies...
::'''Ranjit:''' As I said before, they're probably the first things you'll meet if you travel to Natlan through Sumeru. The [["Children of Echoes"|mines]] in eastern Natlan are their stomping grounds.
::'''Ranjit:''' Those mines are also home to the {{Rubi|[[Nanatzcayan]]|Children of Echoes|center=1}} people. Fine miners and excavators, they are, and skilled appraisers of gems.
::'''Ranjit:''' Sound boring to you, right? But they're a happy lot, especially their chief...
::'''Ranjit:''' Whatever the case, be sure to pay them a visit if you find yourself heading to Natlan in the future... Those little Tepetlisauri, I mean. You'll love 'em, I can already tell.
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to handle. See you around.
::'''Ranjit:''' No worries. I'll wait for you here.

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available near the [[Jadeplume Terrorshroom]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ranjit:''' Are you ready?
:{{DIcon|Specially-Shaped Saurian Search}} Yep, let's go.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me the tale of [[Kuntur]]...
::'''Ranjit:''' I've gotta admit that my friend only told me the back half. I wonder, what did his father do to warrant such hate from the sun?
::'''Ranjit:''' If it wasn't enough to punish the poor fellow by blinding his father with its golden arrows, the sun would hide itself behind a layer of clouds wherever he went.
::'''Ranjit:''' I hear that there are murals that record the tale, though I have never seen them myself.
::'''Ranjit:''' Speaking of which, Natlan's murals are very unique, and they're as lovely as they are fascinating. Sometimes I wonder if I should be bringing my [[Kamera]] to Natlan instead of my pots...
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to handle. See you around.
::'''Ranjit:''' No worries. I'll wait for you here.

=== Dialogue Set #4 ===
''Available near the [[Millennial Pearl Seahorse]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ranjit:''' Want to head out now?
:{{DIcon|Specially-Shaped Saurian Search}} Let's go.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the flying companion...
::'''Ranjit:''' Right. Going back to the story about Kuntur, his companion, [[Iktomisaurus]], was a Saurian with great powers of flight.
::'''Ranjit:''' You could even say that without Iktomisaurus's help, Kuntur would've found his success much harder to win.
::'''Ranjit:''' A flying companion's pretty convenient... and come to think of it, [[Paimon|yours]] flies, too. So, she have any special skills?
::'''{{DIcon}}''' She can make terrifying amounts of food disappear nigh-instantaneously.
:::'''Ranjit:''' Amazing! Any chef worth their salt would be overjoyed to hear of such a skill.
:::'''Ranjit:''' Let me cook for her next time, alright? My friends from Natlan all told me that I should stay and cook for the Saurians &mdash; said I'd be a smash hit. 
:::'''Ranjit:''' So yeah, I'm sure your companion would enjoy my food too!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the hot springs...
::'''Ranjit:''' Ah, I've seen a few in [[Fontaine]], hot enough to scald you! I hear that wherever the [[Emperor of Fire and Iron]] dwells, the waters there are exceptionally hot...
::'''Ranjit:''' But Natlan's hot springs are different. Now, how should I put it... they can heal wounds of body and spirit both.
::'''Ranjit:''' That's what makes them so addictive, in fact...
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to handle. See you around.
::'''Ranjit:''' No worries. I'll wait for you here.
