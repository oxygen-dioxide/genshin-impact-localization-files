{{Description|A vibrant plant that has also been named "lycoris" by the poets. It was once thought extinct in the Inazuman archipelago, only to re-emerge now upon the battlefields. It is said that it blooms most enchantingly where much blood was spilled.<br />Though it is very rare and expensive, this plant is regarded as ominous, and thus is little purchased. Rumor has it that these plants are watered using blood. The bloodier and more brutal the battlefield, the more lovely the dendrobium blooms shall be. Inazumans believe that the souls of the fallen shall follow the winding paths of the bloodied dendrobiums into the next life, thus rejoining the eternal elemental cycle.<br />But as for those who doubt or are perplexed by "eternity," they shall be shackled to the earth, becoming another enchantingly red flower amid the vermillion fields.}}

==Trivia==
* The properties of the plant may be a reference to the {{w|Lycoris radiata|red spider lily}}, also known as the {{Lang|higanbana|ja=彼岸花|ja_tl=distant-shore flower}}. They are associated with death and the afterlife in East Asian mythology, and are said to grow along the path to the {{w|Yomi|underworld}}.
** The in-game description of the Dendrobium mentions that the flower is also called "lycoris" in poetry. The higanbana is known as ''Lycoris radiata'' in binomial nomenclature.
