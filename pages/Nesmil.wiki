{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nesmil:''' We have a new wine today. A glass for you?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Nesmil:''' This is Djafar Tavern, the best in Port Ormos! Our boss here can get hold of any good wine!
::'''Nesmil:''' Nearby merchants, tourists, sailors... and my old friends from [[the Eremites]] all come here to indulge in drinking from time to time.
::'''Nesmil:''' And there's also the tasty appetizers. Personally, I think you can have them as meals, even without drinks!
::{{DIcon}} Old friend of the Eremites?
::'''Nesmil:''' Hehe, sorry, I don't look like someone who's been in the Eremites, do I?
::'''Nesmil:''' But I was a veritable mercernary there! I could punch sea monsters in the face!
::'''Nesmil:''' Well, that was a joke. It's hard to beat a sea monster. But to deal with a couple of drunks, it's as easy as pie.
::'''Nesmil:''' Even when there's something I can't handle, I have the gorgeous, gentle and powerful [[Roshana]] here.
::'''Nesmil:''' Anyone who annoys her will come to a bad end.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Gorgeous... and gentle...
:::'''Nesmil:''' Shh, quiet, don't let her hear you!
:::'''Nesmil:''' Every time I say something like that, she thinks I'm nagging and gives me the cold shoulder. I don't want that.
:::'''Nesmil:''' To be honest, I left the Eremites for here because of Roshana.
:::'''Nesmil:''' She is such a visionary! I enjoy much more freedom here than freelancing for the [[Akademiya]].
:::'''Nesmil:''' But don't tell her I said that. I'll bribe you with some nice cooking!
::;(Obtain [[Fish With Cream Sauce]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Nesmil:''' Take care, and please do come again!
