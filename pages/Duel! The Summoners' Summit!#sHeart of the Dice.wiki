'''Heart of the Dice''' is a part of the [[Duel! The Summoners' Summit!]] event in [[Version 3.7]].

==Tutorial==
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Duel! The Summoners' Summit! Heart of the Dice 1.png
|text1  = In "Heart of the Dice" challenge stages, you will obtain Invokation Dice randomly upon defeating opponents. These will include {{Color|help|dice that correspond to the seven elements}} and a form of {{Color|help|Omni Dice}}. Putting characters of certain Elemental Types into your party will {{Color|help|increase the odds}} of that same type of dice appearing. Each character of a specific element will increase the odds of that type of dice appearing, but this increase will experience diminishing returns as the number of characters of that type increases
|image2 = Tutorial Duel! The Summoners' Summit! Heart of the Dice 2.png
|text2  = You can {{Color|help|store 4 dice}} at maximum during challenges. Upon storing 4 dice, if any of those stored dice are {{Color|help|not of the same Elemental Type}} as all your party members, then the next time you obtain a die, it will be {{Color|help|changed}} to a die that {{Color|help|matches}} a party member's Elemental Type.
|image3 = Tutorial Duel! The Summoners' Summit! Heart of the Dice 3.png
|text3  = You can use a Suppressive Roll during the challenge every {{Color|help|20s}}. After using this, you will {{Color|help|consume all}} the Invokation Dice you currently possess and unleash a shockwave that deals AoE DMG to nearby opponents. The {{Color|help|Elemental Type}} of the shockwave DMG is determined by that of the current active character.
|image4 = Tutorial Duel! The Summoners' Summit! Heart of the Dice 4.png
|text4  = {{Color|help|The more}} Invokation Dice of the same Elemental Type as your current active character you consume in Suppressive Roll, the {{Color|help|more DMG}} the resultant shockwave will deal when unleashed, and the more easily you can obtain more buffs.<br>The Elemental Type of Omni Invokation Dice will always be considered the same as that of your current active character.
|image5 = Tutorial Duel! The Summoners' Summit! Heart of the Dice 5.png
|text5  = During this challenge, you must defeat opponents that constantly emerge to obtain points within the allotted time. Of those opponents, Elites will provide more points. Once the challenge ends, you will gain different ratings based on the number of points you gained.
