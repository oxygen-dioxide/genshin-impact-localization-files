Because the suffix "神" can be translated as either "Archon" or "God" (for example, when Barbatos is referred to as the {{Lang|mini=1|zh=风神|zh_tl=Wind God}}, the term has been translated as both "Anemo Archon" and "Anemo God"), it is unclear how the term "花神" would officially be translated.</ref> is the current [[Dendro]] [[Archon]] among [[The Seven]] and presides over [[Sumeru]].<ref name="C2A3P9">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref><ref group="Note">In the Chinese version of [[Wishes (Quest)|Wishes]], Yae Miko says: {{Lang|"Oh, so it wasn't clear to you guys yet?

Text-related fixes for English are as follows:<br />The original reference to the personal pronoun was: "He." It will now be corrected to "She." Original description: "Lesser Lord Kusanali (He/Him)." Revised description: "Lesser Lord Kusanali (She/Her)."''<br />This was the first time a change to a character's pronouns was both publicly announced and changed over a large number of localizations at once, which indicates that these localizations incorrectly assumed male pronouns for the God of Wisdom and were directed to switch to female pronouns. A similar situation has previously occurred in the English localization: [[Breeze Amidst the Forest]] originally used male pronouns for [[Gold]], then quietly changed to gender-neutral (they/them) pronouns with revelations in [[Version 1.2]] that suggested Albedo's master, the female alchemist [[Rhinedottir]], may be linked to Gold.</ref>

==Profile==
===Introduction===
{{Quote|These markings of tree and leaf pay due honor to wisdom and the passage of time. All this, on a single kite &mdash; truly astonishing.|[[Zhongli]], in reference to the kite constructed for the God of Wisdom.}}
[[Zhongli]] first mentions the God of Wisdom while purchasing kites for the Rite of Parting in "[[Downtown]]." [[Ganyu]] later mentions her in "[[Solitary Fragrance]]," remarking that she is the youngest of the current Seven at five hundred years old, as opposed to [[Morax]] who was over 6000 years old at the time of his supposed death.

===Personality===
{{Quote|The God of Wisdom's enemy is wisdom itself, and the oasis of knowledge is a mirage in the desert of ignorance. In the city of scholars there is a push for folly, yet the God of Wisdom makes no argument against it.|[[Dainsleif]]<ref name="teyvat trailer">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]</ref>}}

Little is known about the God of Wisdom's personality. However, [[Dainsleif]]'s line about her in the Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview criticizes her for allowing a "push for folly" through her own inaction.<ref name="teyvat trailer" /> Over the course of [[Lisa]]'s two years of study at the [[Sumeru Akademiya]], she grew disillusioned by the "uninhibited erudition" she witnessed; despite being acknowledged as a student without equal in 200 years, she chose to return to Mondstadt and become a librarian.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Lisa|5}}</ref> [[Yae Miko]] similarly calls Sumeru's treatment of knowledge as a resource "truly inexplicable," before wondering whether this was developed by Lesser Lord Kusanali or the sages.<ref name="C2A3P9"/>

On the other hand, the people of Sumeru seem to adore her. Her title, "Lesser Lord Kusanali," is their term of endearment for her.<ref name="C2A3P9" />

===Appearance===

In her depiction in Sumeru Statues of the Seven, she is shown to be wearing a similar cloak and draping clothing similar to the other known Archon statues. Her small frame is also shown sitting on a huge leaf, an attribute owing to her mantle as the Dendro Archon.

==Story==
===History===
During the [[cataclysm]] five hundred years ago, the previous Dendro Archon, the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], perished in [[Khaenri'ah]].<ref name="VV" /><ref group="Note">The original Chinese description for Viridescent Venerer's Determination states that the disaster "descended upon the ancient kingdom" and that "the God of the Woods died together with the disaster."</ref> Some time afterwards, Lesser Lord Kusanali ascended to the position of Archon.<ref name="C1A3P3" />

The day of Lesser Lord Kusanali's birth is celebrated in Sumeru as the [[Sabzeruz Festival]].<ref name="Windblume Research Report" />

===Archon Quests===
Lesser Lord Kusanali is first mentioned in [[Chapter I]] by Zhongli and Ganyu as the God of Dendro, where the [[Traveler]] learns that she is the youngest of The Seven. After the events of [[Chapter II]], Yae Miko suggests that the Traveler venture to Sumeru next and seek Lesser Lord Kusanali out.<ref name="C2A3P9" />

Lesser Lord Kusanali will appear in [[Chapter III]] of the Teyvat Chapter Storyline, which focuses on Sumeru.<ref name="teyvat trailer" />

===Event Quests===
It is heavily implied that Lesser Lord Kusanali talked to [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] during [[Summertime Odyssey]], first by intercepting the Dodoco Communication signal and then by speaking directly into the Traveler's mind.<ref group="Note">See [[#Trivia|Trivia]] for details.</ref> She says she is curious about the Traveler and that they may meet in the future.

==Trivia==
* Following the current naming convention for the Archons' elemental titles, the title of Dendro Archon should be {{Lang|mini=1|zh=草神|zh_tl=Grass God}} rather than Lesser Lord Kusanali's {{Lang|mini=1|zh=花神|zh_tl=Flower God}}. It is unknown whether this is to distinguish her from the previous Dendro Archon, if it is simply part of the people of Sumeru's term of endearment for her, or if it may be because the Dendro Archon is a different entity from Lesser Lord Kusanali.
** Both Lesser Lord Kusanali and her predecessor, the [[God of the Woods]], are associated with plant life beyond solely grass (Dendro). The Chinese title for the God of the Woods means the God of (All) Plants, with the term {{Lang|mini=1|zh=草木|zh_tl=plants}} being comprised of {{Lang|mini=1|zh=草|zh_tl=grass}} and {{Lang|mini=1|zh=木|zh_tl=tree; wood}}. Lesser Lord Kusanali, meanwhile, is associated with both grass and flowers. The exact significance of this has yet to be revealed.
* In [[Ritou]], the NPC [[Vahid]] mentions that Lesser Lord Kusanali is the giver of the Anahitian Blessing, which is said to be a type of fertilizer infused with elemental energy that grants vitality to the land no matter how barren it is. In {{w|Zoroastrianism}}, {{w|Anahita}} is the deity most associated with water, healing, fertility and wisdom. That said, Zoroastrianism has a separate deity over wisdom called {{w|Ahura Mazda}}, whose name literally translates to "Lord of Wisdom." In different time periods, Ahura Mazda was either worshipped alone, or in a triad alongside Anahita and {{w|Mithra}}, the deity of contracts and light.

===Etymology===
* The name Kusanali likely refers to the Kusanali-Jātaka, one of the poems within the [https://www.jatland.com/home/Jataka Jātaka], a series of 547 Buddhist poems detailing the previous births of Buddha. The Kusanali-Jātaka specifically details the encounter with a tree sprite.
** "Kusanali" itself is derived from the Pali words ''kusa'' ("{{w|Desmostachya bipinnata|kusa-grass}}," a sacred plant) and ''nāḷi'' ("a hollow stalk or tube").
** In Chinese, "Lesser Lord Kusanali" is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=小吉祥草王|zh_rm=Xiǎo Jíxiángcǎo Wáng|zh_tl=Little Lucky-Grass Monarch}}. The word {{Lang|mini=1|zh=吉祥草}} may be derived from the Jātaka verse {{Lang|"''Yathā ahaṁ Kusanāḷī rucāyaṁ''"|en=Just as (the reed-god) Kusanāḷi did to this tree|zh=于此鲁伽树，吉祥草助我|zh_tl=As to the ruca-tree will the lucky-grass help me}}. The word is also used to refer to the kusa-grass.
** In Korean, the name is {{Lang|mini=1|ko=쿠사나리 데비|ko_rm=Kusanari Debi}}. The word {{Lang|mini=1|ko=데비|ko_rm=Debi}} derived from the Sanskrit word ''devī'' ("goddess" or "queen").
** In Japanese, the name is {{Lang|mini=1|ja=クラクサナリデビ|ja_rm=Kura Kusanari Debi}}, where {{Lang|mini=1|ja=デビ|ja_rm=Debi}} may be of the same derivation as above, and {{Lang|mini=1|ja=クラ|ja_rm=Kura}} may be derived from the Pali word ''khudda'' ("small", "inferior" or "low"). ''Kura'' may also be derived from the Persian word {{Lang|mini=1|fa=خدا|fa_rm=Khuda}} ("Lord" or "God").
