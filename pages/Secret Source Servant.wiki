'''Secret Source Servants''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. Most behave like [[Hydro Eidolon]]s; they communicate through gestures and reward the player for helping them with small tasks.

The ancient [[dragon]]s created these [[Secret Source Automaton]]s to assist with day-to-day life. They are able to control other Secret Source technologies, which allows them to dispel barriers, create [[Spiritway]]s, and communicate with other Secret Source Automatons. Some highly intelligent models have advanced speech and memory capabilities &mdash; these were typically assigned to a particular master.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|In Search of a Hidden Heart|quote=I am the only intelligent Secret Source Servant without a master. Even after Lord Xiuhcoatl fell, I was still in charge of ... The most basic city maintenance and information recording functions.}}</ref>

Secret Source Servants resemble small mammals with long, thin tails and dragon-like faces. When active, their body glows with a golden light resembling [[Iridescent Inscription]]s, and the Secret Source Core on their tail spins continuously. When inactive, they curl up in a fetal position.
