Digging up her treasure, located on the shoreline opposite of [[Erinnyes Forest]], grants an Exquisite Chest. Opening the chests from all 8 treasure maps allows the player to form [[Rainbow Rose's Ideals]].

[[File:Parker's Hopes Map.png|300px]]

Parker and her husband swore to travel around Fontaine and spent their entire lives on the road.<br>
They had a daughter, [[Penny]], a lovely girl who loved swimming and fish.<br>
They left her with their best friend, [[Rouge]], to spare her the disruption and rootlessness.<br>
Despite the lack of a fixed abode, Parker's life is full of joy and surprises, and she hopes her child will share that same happiness.

Parker also wishes the reader of this letter that happiness. Why not go and find the surprise she has hidden for you?<br>
Hint: The "surprise" is in the belly of the "fish." {{color|buzzword|The key to finding the surprise is in the eye of that "fish."}}
