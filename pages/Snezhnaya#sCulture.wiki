{{RegionTabs}}
Snezhnayan culture is often very cutthroat, relating to the harsh environment of the frozen nation. The [[Tsaritsa]] extends her sphere of influence to the other seven nations of [[Teyvat]] through the [[Fatui]].

==Life in Snezhnaya==
Due to Snezhnaya's harsh climate, people spend most of their time indoors and consider being alive to be a blessing in itself. There also seems to be a large emphasis on familial relations, as the Snezhnayans who have mentioned their family have been shown to be very close to them.<ref name="MCC1-1">{{Ref/Quest|Across the Sea}}</ref>

Camaraderie, cooperation and straightforwardness generally appear to be valued in Snezhnaya. The [[Adventurers' Guild]], a mutual help organization for adventurers, was established in Snezhnaya,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Lan}}</ref> while the [[Archive]] descriptions for [[Fatui Skirmishers]] remark that despite leaving their families to enter a dangerous profession, they have "gained allies to stick through thick and thin with". Tartaglia states that while Fire-Water is loved by most, those who drink it and chat together out in the cold gain the other's complete trust.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Tartaglia}}</ref> Drinking an entire glass of Fire-Water in one go is the norm and considered to be very respectful.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Vile}}</ref>

Snezhnayans also display remarkable devotion to their [[Archon]], the Tsaritsa. Those who have been dispatched overseas and grown fond of their new country state that no matter the circumstances, they would never betray her.<ref name="Andrei">{{Ref/NPC|Andrei}}</ref>

{{Quote|You make a pinkie promise, you keep it all your life. You break a pinkie promise, I throw you on the ice. The cold will kill the pinkie that once betrayed your friend, the frost will freeze your tongue off so you never lie again.|A Snezhnayan nursery rhyme}}

On the other hand, the strong sense of kinship and emphasis on loyalty makes them view any kind of disloyalty, betrayal, or "debt" as a deeply personal affront. This appears to be the most well-known aspect of Snezhnayan culture, as Paimon remarks that the above nursery rhyme "kinda says all you need to know about Snezhnayan culture,"<ref name="MCC1-1" /> The Fatui have an entire "debt collection" division that hunts down those who owe any "debt" to the Fatui, whether monetarily or from somehow offending the organization.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Fatui Pyro Agent}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
Seaside regions of Snezhnaya primarily eat seafood.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|3}}</ref> It is unknown whether this is true for all of Snezhnaya, or if this is largely limited to coastal towns. Snezhnaya is also known for its Fire-Water, an extremely powerful alcoholic blend.

According to Tartaglia, one authentic Snezhnayan dish is {{w|borscht}}, which typically refers to a sour soup made with beetroots.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Tartaglia|note=Friendship Level 7}}</ref>

===Technology===
[[File:Domain_The_Wonderful_World_Of_Mr._Cyclops.png|thumb|Snezhnayan boilers powering mechanical gear drives]]
Snezhnayan technology is undoubtedly superior to that of the other six nations. This is particularly true of their military, as [[Venti]], the mortal vessel of [[Barbatos]], states that they far surpass the other nations' military. The Fatui military is notably the only known human faction in which all of its members are capable of elemental attacks, further highlighting their strength. The [[Fatui Skirmishers]] cover both ranged and melee departments, with their ranged fighters using guns or staves, while the [[Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard]] wields a massive hammer and the [[Fatui Skirmisher - Anemoboxer Vanguard]] wields a pair of boxing gloves. The Skirmishers are also capable of imbuing their equipment, enhancing both offensive and defensive power at the same time, but it can be shorted out with enough dangerous reactions, which temporarily dazes its user, but groups with Anemoboxers are able to overcome this situation.

The knives used by [[Fatui Pyro Agent|Fatui Agents]] are made with superior technology and meant to take advantage of human weaknesses.

Harbinger [[Il Dottore]]'s former Ruin Guard research facility requires no human personnel to operate, saving on manpower costs. [[Alice]] also remarks that when she visited Snezhnaya, there were massive factories pumping out a wide assortment of items, which have yet to be seen in any other nation so far.

==Designs, Motifs, and Symbols==
{{See also|Symbols in Teyvat}}
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are typically seen on Snezhnaya-related parties.

===Character Cards===
[[File:Character_Tartaglia_Card.png|thumb|Tartaglia's Character Card]]
Because the only playable Snezhnayan so far is [[Tartaglia]], who is one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]], it is unknown whether non-Fatui characters will have a different Character Card. (For example, there are two different [[Liyue/Culture#Character Cards|Liyue Character Cards]] depending on whether the character is affiliated with the [[adepti]] or not.)

Tartaglia's Character Card depicts eleven emblems, each representing a Harbinger, arranged in the negative space between the larger and smaller circles. It is assumed that the emblems are also their Constellations, as Tartaglia's (the bottommost one) is the same symbol used for his in-game Constellation, Monoceros Caeli.

===Fatui Emblem===
[[File:Fatui Banner.png|thumb]]
The Fatui emblem ''(unofficial name)'' is the logo of the Fatui that is typically seen on their masks and/or clothing and designate the person's affiliation with them. It depicts a stylized, filled-in [[Solomon's knot]] on top of another circular emblem.

==Economy==
Snezhnaya is the second-wealthiest nation in Teyvat after [[Liyue]]. This is primarily the result of Harbinger [[Pantalone]], who determines Snezhnaya's economic policies<ref name="Andrei" /> and is particularly driven to make Snezhnaya the wealthiest nation in all Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Pale Flame}}</ref>

Using their factories to mass-produce household wares,<ref>{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|1|Mondstadt Chapter|quote=[...] we might just build ourselves a perpetual motion machine that can support a huge factory like in Snezhnaya!}}</ref> Snezhnaya exports their goods to other nations in Teyvat.<ref name="Ivanovich">{{Ref/NPC|Ivanovich}}</ref>

Snezhnayan merchants had hoped to trade their Fire-Water with [[Mondstadt]], but this was cut short when [[Diluc]] refused the offer, having been put out cold for three days after drinking it and realizing that it was too strong for Mondstadt's tastes.

==Festivals and Holidays==
===Krsnik Noc===
{{main|Krsnik Noc}}

Little is currently known about Krsnik Noc beyond the fact that it is celebrated in Snezhnaya.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Ivanovich|c=during Lantern Rite}}</ref> Ivanovich likens the festival mood during [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]] to Krsnik Noc celebrations.

==Politics==
Currently, it appears that Snezhnaya is directly governed by the [[Tsaritsa]] and the Fatui. Some of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] also play vital roles in Snezhnayan politics, and sometimes become personally involved in matters regarding foreign relations.<ref name="Ivanovich" /><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Goth}}</ref>

Most of Snezhnaya's foreign relations are handled by the Fatui, though their aggressive negotiation style and constant political and economic encroachment have given them a negative reputation. However, this does not seem to have greatly affected merchants who are not directly linked to the Fatui like [[Ivanovich]] and [[Maksim]], who have not faced any explicit prejudice from natives. The Adventurers' Guild, despite hailing from Snezhnaya, also does not appear to have any negative reputation linked to it; however, it is also possible that its nation of origin is not common knowledge.

Domestically, little is known about the Fatui's reputation within Snezhnaya. However, it is hinted that ordinary citizens have little dealings with the Fatui on a day-to-day basis and see them largely as a military organization. [[Tartaglia]] claims he doesn't want his family "to have anything to do with the Fatui's... or should I say, Snezhnaya's... darker side."<ref name="MCC1-1" />

===Military===
The Fatui conscript Snezhnayans into military training, but the qualifications for conscription are currently unknown and it seems that not all who enter military training necessarily join the Fatui.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|5}}</ref>

Members of the Fatui military consist of Skirmishers and more advanced groups, sent to a region based on their higher-ups' orders. They are also divided by military rank, with the known ranks being recruit, sergeant and lieutenant. While powerful, Skirmishers do not operate on their own, but instead work with their comrades to surround and overwhelm enemies. The more higher-ranked members, such as Agents, Cicin Mages and [[Mirror Maiden]]s typically operate on their own.

Agents, Cicin Mages and Mirror Maidens also rely on a [[Delusion]] rather than the elemental equipment that the Skirmishers are given.
