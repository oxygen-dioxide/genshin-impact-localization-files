'''Phantom in Boots''' is a 4-Star [[Character Outfit]] for [[Kirara]]. 

During [[Version 4.8]], Phantom in Boots was obtainable for free as a reward from [[Summertide Scales and Tales]], after finding 125 [[Excerpts of Bliss]] in [[Simulanka]]. In [[Version 5.0]], it became purchasable in the Character Outfit Shop for the cost of {{Item|Genesis Crystal|25|x=1,680}}.

==Appearance==
Kirara's hair is styled into choppy waist-length tufts, with two thin strands tied into pigtails. She sports various pins in her hair, wearing one green fish-shaped pin on a front strand, and two green star pins fastening her pigtails. 

Kirara wears a white collared button-up top with ruffled detached sleeves, the left one fastened by a brown arm band and the right with a teal sleeve overlapping it. She wears black shorts with teal frills and four golden rhombuses over the front. Over her top, she wears a brown to dark blue open vest with golden accents, held together by a teal clasp with two belt buckles that extends into two long pieces of ornate fabric. She also sports a green bow tie with brown accents and a paw charm in the center. On the left of her shorts is a teal and brown striped bow completed with a black mask ornament, attached to her {{Dendro}} [[Vision]]. 

She accessorizes using a pair of brown gloves with rhombus cut-outs and white ruffles, a black, teal and golden top hat, and a brown cross-shaped leg garter on her right thigh. For footwear, she sports thigh-length brown lace up boots, decorated with flower and cat-shaped ornaments and teal ribbons. The bottom of her boots are hollow, leaving her paws bare.

==Description==
[[Simulanka]]'s rules dictate that the essence of all life in it must conform to the image created by the [[Goddess of Fate]].<br><!--
-->In other words, Kirara's intrepid manner corresponds to a certain character in the fairy tale that the goddess penned.<br><!--
-->However, despite her &mdash; and your &mdash; travels all across Simulanka, you never heard the tale of any such itinerant hero.<br><!--
-->Confused, you asked the [[detective]], for you knew that he had heard the goddess's voice, and was the keeper of a great many secrets.<br><br><!--
-->And so, from his lips you drew this tale&mdash;<br><!--
-->Amongst the multitude of creatures, the cat was favored of the goddess, such that she even tried to create a realm just for them within Simulanka.<br><!--
-->As in her great plan, this new realm would be filled with feline residents of all sizes and fur colors.<br><!--
-->Here, happiness would be distributed according to principles of balance, and every resident's happy smile would be perfectly calibrated.<br><!--
-->The cats would never feel sad, and the worst their mood could be was similar to "as if a furball was tickling their throat."<br><!--
-->However, they would never be able to cough it out no matter how hard they tried, for that would be a negative emotion that they could never make manifest.<br><!--
-->With eternal, unchanging joy, and sorrow unable to be birthed, the scales of the heart were not balanced &mdash; nor was this setting.<br><!--
-->Yet the goddess's attention was divided amongst her other manuscripts, and so this story was put on hold even as it waited to unfold.<br><!--
-->"Stories, at their heart, yearn to make sense," or so the goddess is rumored to have said to herself after the fact.<br><!--
-->When internal contradictions are not resolved, the pattern of the plot's progression can become perverted, seeking to resolve these absurdities itself.<br><!--
-->Thus did an itinerant feline heroine appear in the corner of the draft manuscript and, while the goddess was distracted, escape between the margins.<br><!--
-->She stole wrath, tears, and sorrowful sighs from other pages in the manuscript, and she distributed them in every street throughout the country of cats.<br><!--
-->The residents' smiling iron masks began to melt, and they began to diverge from the predetermined paths fate had written for them.<br><!--
-->"A cat's true nature is to be willful and free," the crafty heroine declared.<br><!--
-->The goddess was not displeased at this interdiction by one of her creations. If anything, the heroine's defiance caused her to make a decision.<br><!--
-->She would leave this imperfect idea, now put to paper, be. The realm of cats should indeed be a freer place.<br><br><!--
-->No wonder, then, that you could find no trace of this gallant cat, for that rebellious figure never slipped out from the paper folds, but could only exist in the world's blueprint memory.<br><!--
-->As you were deep in thought, you caught a glimpse of Kirara's bright eyes. She seemed truly taken with this tale.<br><!--
-->"Heh, guess I know why I'm dressed like that itinerant heroine now!"<br><!--
-->"Isn't that just because you happen to be a cat?" So you thought, but you did not voice it.<br><!--
-->"The heroine brought everyone's missing desires back to them &mdash; don't you think that's a lot like what a courier does?"<br><!--
-->"Delivering everything your customers need to them, and making sure they're satisfied..."<br><!--
-->"At their core, both jobs are pretty much the same!"<br><!--
-->Kirara's tail stood up proudly as she said these words.<br><!--
-->Her passion for delivering goods moved even you, and so you accepted the proposed equivalence, even though it remained unclear if Simulanka's rules would uphold such a statement.<br><!--
-->"That's right. Delivery is an amazing vocation!"

==Trivia ==
===Etymology===
*The English outfit name, Phantom in Boots, is a play on {{w|Puss in Boots}}, a European fairy tale about Puss, a clever, anthropomorphic cat which helps his owner become wealthy and famous.
**While swashbuckling is not a part of the original fairy tale, it was added to several different {{w|Adaptations of Puss in Boots|adaptations of Puss' character}}, which likely inspired the outfit's theme.
