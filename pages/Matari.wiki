:'''Matari:''' Yes, ma'am.
:'''Mahshid:''' You [[Eremites]] are too used to idling in the desert to know the importance of rules!
:'''Mahshid:''' If everyone switched shifts at will and didn't follow schedule, it would turn into a big mess!
:'''Matari:''' Yes, you are right.
:'''Mahshid:''' Even though you're a mercenary hired by the [[Akademiya]], your job of keeping law and order on the docks is as crucial as the researchers', got it?
