'''Goulash''' is a [[Food]] item that the player can cook. The [[recipe]] for Goulash is obtainable by completing the [[Dragonspine]] quest ''[[Ah, Fresh Meat!]]''.<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/7398 Version 1.2 Update Notes]</ref>

Goulash reduces the rate of [[Sheer Cold]] accumulation under normal conditions but has no effect on accelerated accumulation when swimming or in [[Snowstorm]] weather. Sheer Cold accumulation is reduced by '''50%''' with a Delicious quality dish, '''40%''' with a Normal quality dish, and '''30%''' with a Suspicious quality dish. This effect stacks additively with other Sheer Cold [[Sheer Cold#Modifiers|modifiers]].

Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].
