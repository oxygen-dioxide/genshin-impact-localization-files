:'''Keshen:''' Powerful opponent...
:: {{A|VO Keshen 01.ogg}} "I still need to test myself against a powerful opponent!"
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Keshen:''' Real battles are the foundation of military training. Fights against powerful foes are necessary!
:{{DIcon}} Opponents?
::'''Keshen:''' That's right! There are many types of foe...
::'''Keshen:''' Charge forward during missions and take the lead in fighting bandits. Treat them as your opponents and use all your abilities against them.
::'''Keshen:''' During drills, I fight against Sergeant Lin with real weapons as if I'm fighting a real opponent, practicing to fight against enemy leaders...
::'''Keshen:''' Of course, the Sergeant has at least ten more years of training than me, so I usually get knocked down, but he's always careful not to hurt me.
::'''Keshen:''' You can also have friendly spars with the hired guards during break time to hone your hand-to-hand combat skills.
::'''Keshen:''' Those will definitely come in handy when you're fighting at close range and can't use your spear.
::'''Keshen:''' In short, fighting against different opponents will teach you how to fight in different environments.
:{{DIcon}} Is your normal training not enough?
::'''Keshen:''' No, no, no. Our routine training covers dozens of different items, such as basic marksmanship, defensive formation basics, moving in offensive formation, and more...
::'''Keshen:''' There's nothing to complain about in terms of variety. Unfortunately, the target audience of the training is the majority. That is to say, ordinary soldiers.
::'''Keshen:''' You'll need to find other ways if you want to become stronger after learning and mastering everything taught by this training.
::'''Keshen:''' My goal in life is to defeat monsters like [[Xuanwen Beast]]s alone, but I have yet to receive [[Rex Lapis]]'s approval and don't have a [[Vision]].
::'''Keshen:''' Therefore, I can only keep honing my martial arts and challenging my physical limits.
::{{DIcon}} So, the strength of a Xuanwen Beast...
::'''Keshen:''' That's difficult to quantify.
::'''Keshen:''' Just like how some people are completely hopeless at martial arts and some are talented geniuses, there are large weak men and slender youths who have extraordinary sword skills...
::'''Keshen:''' I'm sure some Xuanwen Beasts might be extremely weak to the point that even poorly-equipped hired guards can manage them.
::'''Keshen:''' We currently have very little information about the strongest Xuanwen Beasts.
::'''Keshen:''' I'm just estimating here, albeit assuming that they're on the stronger side... But a single paw swipe may be equal to a direct hit from the [[Guizhong Ballista]].
::'''Keshen:''' *sigh* Can a mortal really block such a mighty blow?
::'''Keshen:''' ...No, I can't let this discourage me. I need to train harder!
:{{DIcon}} Great point! Talk to you next time!
::'''Keshen:''' Hmm? Thanks for the recognition. If you have a chance, why don't we have a friendly spar next time?
