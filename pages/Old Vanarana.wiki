Until the [[Aranyaka]]: Part III - [[Nursery of Lost Dreams]] quest ''[[For All Children Who Long for Life]]'' is completed, Old Vanarana is completely engulfed in [[The Withering]], which has a stronger effect than in most other locations.

==Lore==
After the Cataclysm, the Aranara imprisoned [[Marana's Avatar]] deep within Old Vanarana with four layers of seals, the first of which was the "Door of Vana," or the gate that connects the [[Fane of Ashvattha]] to Old Vanarana. The second seal was bound with three Inscriptions of Remembrance created by [[Aramaha]], [[Arayama]], and [[Araji]], who later became [[Vasara Tree]]s in [[Ashvattha's Concourse]]s to further defend against Marana. The third seal was made with numerous Aranara's [[Mystic Arts in Teyvat#Ararakalari|Ararakalari]], including [[Aramaha]]'s [[Dendrogranum#Healthy Dendrograna|Healthy Dendrograna]], [[Arayama]]'s [[Claustroflora]], and [[Aradasha]]'s [[Stone Pillar Seal]]s. The final seal was located at [[Sand-Embraced Home]], and was guarded by [[Aramuhukunda]] himself.

Unfortunately, over time, [[The Withering|Marana]]'s corrosion had gradually leaked out despite the seals. In ''[[Nursery of Lost Dreams]]'', the [[Traveler]] and [[Arama]] undid all four seals and entered the [[Land of Grounded Dreams]], where they defeated Marana's Avatar, and Arama became the new [[Ashvattha Tree]]. Afterwards, Old Vanarana finally began to rejuvenate.
