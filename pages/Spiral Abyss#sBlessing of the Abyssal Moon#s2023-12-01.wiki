|details    = <li>When off-field characters deal Elemental Skill DMG to an opponent, an Uncanny Mark will be placed upon that opponent. When another active character hits a marked opponent with an attack of the same Elemental Type, a {{Color|bp|shockwave will be unleashed}} at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. The Uncanny Mark lasts 5s, and Marks created through different attacks with different Elemental Types can exist independently. 1 such shockwave can be unleashed every 2s. When a character enters the field, the Uncanny Marks placed by that character on opponents will be removed.</li>
