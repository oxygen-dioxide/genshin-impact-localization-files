'''Waypoints''' (''unofficial term'') are markers placed at specific locations used in puzzles and exploration. They can be found in [[City of Mondstadt|Mondstadt]], [[Dragonspine]], and [[The Chasm]], in addition to certain [[Time Trial Challenge]]s.

==Types==
===Destination Waypoint===
Destination waypoints mark the specific location of the end of a time trial challenge. Reaching this waypoint will result in the challenge succeeding.
===Intermediate Waypoint===
Intermediate waypoints mark individual locations that must be touched in order to proceed on with a time trial challenge or with a puzzle. After reaching all intermediate waypoints in the correct order a [[Chest]] or the destination waypoint may spawn.
