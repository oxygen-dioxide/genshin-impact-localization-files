'''Waypoints''' (''unofficial term'') are markers placed at specific locations used in puzzles and exploration. They can be found throughout Teyvat, sometimes appearing as part of [[Time Trial Challenge]]s or [[Commission]]s.

When found in the open world outside of a Time Trial or Commission, they appear as a series of vertical rings with an arrow marker in the middle, with each ring appearing as the previous ring is passed through. They most often are placed alongside narrow and precarious trails, such as at the tip of mountain ranges, on cables, atop railings or atop ruined walls.

==Types==
===Start and Intermediate Waypoint===
Intermediate waypoints mark individual locations that must be touched in order to proceed on with a time trial challenge or with a puzzle. After reaching all intermediate waypoints in the correct order a [[Chest]] or the destination waypoint may spawn.

===Destination Waypoint===
Destination waypoints mark the specific location of the end of a time trial challenge. Reaching this waypoint will result in the challenge succeeding and a chest spawning.

===Mondstadt Special Waypoint Challenge===
A special waypoint-like time trial is available in [[Mondstadt City]], around the [[Anemo Archon Statue]]. The challenge requires players to approach the northern end of the plaza's railing, on top of which sits an [[Investigation]] spot-like sparkle. Stepping onto the railing starts a time challenge where the player must run along the plaza's railing and pass through custom dandelion-themed rings as a [[An Interesting Labour|special soundtrack]] plays. Upon reaching the other end of the railing without falling, a [[Luxurious Chest]] is rewarded.
