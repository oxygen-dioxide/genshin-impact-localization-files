The nation of [[Khaenri'ah]] is marked by being a "pride of humankind" which "never had a [[god]] to begin with".

==Life in Khaenri'ah==
===Agriculture===
Khaenri'ah is dark underground and mostly barren of natural life. This led Khaenri'ahns to focus on artificial creation of life itself by developing the [[Art of Khemia]].

===Architecture===
According to [[Dainsleif]], the [[Inverted City|ruins]] in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] look somewhat similar to those of Khaenri'ah, and their civilization had ties to the one of Khaenri'ah.<ref name="grave of guarded">{{Ref/Quest|The Grave of the Guarded}}</ref>

The remnants of ancient Khaenri'ah like the [[Ruins of Dahri]], giant [[Ruin Golem]]s in Sumeru or an [[Viewpoint/Forge of the Abandoned Foundry|Azosite factory]] located in the [[Girdle of the Sands]] all share a grandiose scale. Furthermore, the Golems, the Azosite factory and the [[Madinat al-Nuhas]] testing facility share the same industrial, brass feel on the inside.

===Education===
Khaenri'ah possessed a Royal Library, to which nobles (no information about others) such as [[Chlothar]] had access. They were still forbidden from accessing the banned texts which the library held, among which were those that involved recipes that required the power and blessings from the [[The Seven|Seven]], as they were considered taboo.<ref name="FMP">{{Ref/Quest|Fortune-Mocking Pedigree}}</ref>

===Technology===
Khaenri'ahn technology before the [[cataclysm]] was advanced enough to allow production of [[automatons]] known as [[Ruin Machine]]s, which were considered weapons of war. These machines could remain active for hundreds of years, mostly due in part to a self-repair system. They took on the forms of various wildlife on the surface and could even imitate some of their functions.

Khaenri'ahns used [[Azosite]] as a form of energy, drawn from pure elemental energy from [[Ley Lines]],<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Sumeru|Azosite}}</ref> formed into [[Energy Block]]s for use and produced in the factory located in the [[Girdle of the Sands]].<ref name="Rene Notes">{{Ref/Item|Rene's Investigation Notes}}</ref> This workshop was the last in the entire kingdom to use an Azosite-powered system.<ref>Interactable: [[Gavireh Lajavard#Ragged Engineering Notes|Ragged Engineering Notes]]</ref>

Khemia was also an advanced art, compared to widespread [[alchemy]].

==Designs, Motifs, and Symbols==
{{See also|Symbols in Teyvat}}
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are largely exclusive to the Khaenri'ah or Khaenri'ah-affiliated parties.

===Four-Pointed Star===
[[File:Talent Homuncular Nature.png|thumb|The four-pointed star in [[Albedo]]'s talent, [[Homuncular Nature]].]]
The '''four-pointed star''' (unofficial name), is a recurring {{w|{{Not a Typo|astroid}}}} star. It is a recurring symbol on Khaenri'ah-adjacent characters' clothing and design. Notably, pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns have pupils that take the shape of a four-pointed star. The shape can be found on [[Albedo]]'s neck between his collarbones. This symbol is also prominently used in association with the [[Traveler]].

===Eight-Pointed Star===
[[File:Item Chaos Oculus.png|thumb|150x150px|The eight-pointed star on a [[Chaos Oculus]]]]
This motif is a recurring symbol tied to Khaenri'ah, present on [[Chlothar]]'s and [[Halfdan]]'s clothes, [[The Black Serpents]]' armors and on [[Gate of Zulqarnain]]. The eight-pointed star shape also appears on or around the 'eyes' of Ruin Machines.

==Languages==
Little is known about Khaenri'ah's native language. [[The Black Serpents|Black Serpent Knight]]s attempt to speak it while guarding [[hilichurl]]s in the Chasm, but Dainsleif is only able to make out one word, "run."<ref name="grave of guarded" />

With the influx of the immigrants, Khaenri'ah likely used the [[Teyvat Language|common language]]. It is also likely that the nation used a version of now-associated with the Abyss [[Latin-Based Language]].

==Politics==
Before the cataclysm, Khaenri'ah had been a monarchy with a stratified society, by class and likely by nationality (native Khaenri'ahns contrasted with the immigrants). Around the time of the cataclysm, the political power of the [[Eclipse Dynasty]] waned, allowing the noble [[Alberich Clan]] to usurp power with [[Anfortas]] as the regent.

Following the gods' invasion of Khaenri'ah, the current leadership is unknown, but people still continue to live in the nation and struggle against the curse inflicted by them. [[Kaeya]] was intentionally abandoned in [[Mondstadt]] near the [[Dawn Winery]] for the sake of an "ancient plot".
