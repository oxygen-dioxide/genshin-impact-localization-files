{{Description|The flow of experience and gold within the ley lines has been notable of late...<br>Use the power of Original Resin to make Blossoms of Wealth and Blossoms of Revelation bloom brilliantly, and bring forth shining [[Mora]] and forerunners' experiences into the world.}}
'''Ley Line Overflow''' is a [[Event]] in [[Version 4.0]].

==Duration==
2023/09/18 04:00 - 2023/09/25 03:59

==Requirements==
Revitalize a [[Blossom of Wealth]] or a [[Blossom of Revelation]]

==Event Details==
During the event, Travelers who successfully complete a Blossom of Wealth or Blossom of Revelation and claim the rewards by using [[Original Resin]] will receive double the rewards. A total of 3 such bonuses will be available each day.

{{Item|Condensed Resin|30}} cannot be used to claim double rewards. However, claiming the double rewards have the same output as one: doubling everything including {{Item|Companionship EXP|30}} and {{Item|Adventure EXP|30}}.

After claiming rewards from a Ley Line Outcrop, the following message appears:

"1 multiplied Ley Line Overflow reward consumed. Attempts remaining today: X/3"

If the Reunion Blessing bonus from the [[Stellar Reunion]] permanent event is active, then the Reunion Blessing bonus will be consumed first.

Event subtraction rules are as follows: Improved reward instances are first subtracted from the event with the highest Multiplier. If the Multiplier is equal for both events, then double reward instances are first subtracted  from the "Stellar Reunion" event.
