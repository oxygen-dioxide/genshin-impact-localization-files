'''Rouran''' {{Lang|zh=柔然|zh_rm=Róurán}} is the master of the [[Pearl Galley]], mentioned by [[Luoxia]] during "[[The Ocean Pearl]]" and in her regular dialogue.

Little is known about him besides the fact that he has taken great interest in the [[Traveler]] &mdash; and Luoxia indicates that the Traveler has unknowingly met him, too.

''(To be added.)''

===Personality===
Rouran has taken a great interest in the Traveler, even writing an invitation and giving it to Luoxia &mdash; only to give her instructions not to give it to them until they have finished going around trying to get an invitation from the unwilling guests.

===Appearance===
Based on Luoxia's description of him, Rouran appears to be rather physically frail.
