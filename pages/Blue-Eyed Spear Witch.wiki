'''Blue-Eyed Spear Witch''' is a notable person from the time of the Late Aristocracy about 1000 years ago. While her name is currently unrevealed, she's recognizable for her sapphire-blue eyes, being a sorceress, wielding a [[Crescent Pike|spear]] of her own design, and her noticeable scar from when the aristocrats branded her.

==History==
Her origin is currently unknown, but the earliest mention of her is when [[Parsifal]] encounters her when robbing a mansion. He gives her a sapphire gem from a silver cup that he stole since the gem matches her eyes.<ref name="Wine and Song">{{Ref/Weapon|Wine and Song}}</ref> However, it appears she's a slave in the noble house, as she gets punished by her master when the gem is discovered in her possession since the noble family crest is visible within the gem that proves it was stolen. She is branded on her face with a criminal's brand as punishment.<ref name="Alley Hunter">{{Ref/Weapon|Alley Hunter}}</ref> Her relationship with Parsifal became rather complicated after this point, as she reasonably blamed him for her injuries but still harbored feelings for him.

It's currently unclear at what point in her life she learned magic and when she mastered the spear, but at some point she was able to visualize the fatal flaws in anyone she encountered and designed a spear to be able to target and strike those fatal flaws.<ref name="Crescent Pike">{{Ref/Weapon|Crescent Pike}}</ref>

Sometime later in her life she trades the sapphire gem that caused her misfortune for the silver cup that used to hold the gem for reasons unknown.<ref name="Heart's Desire">{{Ref/Book|Heart's Desire}}</ref>

At some point she took on [[Eberhart]] as a disciple and he learned her method of fighting with a spear. But when eventually she missed Parsifal greatly, Eberhart noticed the opportunity and killed her while she was distracted, perhaps to keep his prowess with the spear a secret.<ref name="Crescent Pike" /><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Lance}}</ref>
