;(Talk to Xiao)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' So, is the matter resolved?
:{{DIcon}} We took care of it, but&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' &mdash;Good.
:{{DIcon}} Are you really not going to see the Mingxiao Lantern?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' No. As I said, I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year.
:{{DIcon}} The Mingxiao Lantern this year is [[Skybracer]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it's a super impressive-looking giant deer, let's go take a look together!
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' "Skybracer..."
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Huh, a Mingxiao Lantern nonetheless. A fleeting creation of human hand. It means nothing to me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' If this short-lived spectacle is one you wish to witness, I suggest you go to the city.

;(Talk to Xiao again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj003 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' If this short-lived spectacle is one you wish to witness, I suggest you go to the city. I, for one, have no interest in the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]].

;(After talking to Xiao)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, he really won't go, unless... Let's go find the boss.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She might have a few tricks up her sleeve...
----
;(Talk to Verr Goldet)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 verrgoldet 01.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' Sounds like you and Xiao took care of business again.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 huaian 01.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Word certainly got around, the news even reached us here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 verrgoldet 02.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' *sigh* And yet, another year's Lantern Rite will soon be over, and he still won't go and take a look...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 huaian 02.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' *sigh* ...All these long years and I've never seen him attend the Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 huaian 03.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' I'd go as far as to say, it'd be easier bringing the festival to him than the other way around...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bring the festival to him... Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} Nice idea.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! If Xiao won't go to the Lantern Rite, then let's bring the Lantern Rite to him!
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 huaian 04.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' ...Sorry? Surely you realize I was joking... How would you "bring the Lantern Rite to him," exactly?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When we were in the city checking out the festivities, we learned how to make Xiao Lanterns. We even found a food stall serving local delicacies...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So much tasty food, so many pretty Xiao Lanterns, not to mention... um... what else... Oh, the bygone heroes, his old friends.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aren't those the heart and soul of the Lantern Rite?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 verrgoldet 03.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' You're not wrong, but where would we set all that up...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 huaian 05.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Now that you mention it, I wonder... We'd need enough space to set up our own stall. Hmm... There might just be enough room below the inn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 huaian 06.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Let's take a look and choose a space. I believe I know the kind of stall you're after...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 2 huaian 07.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Hmm, there should be a few styles we can reference, let me think...
----
;(Observe the first suitable spot)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 3 huaian 01.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Uh... This is too close to the elevator entrance. I think we can do better...

;(Observe the second suitable spot)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 4 huaian 01.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' No, here we'd be constantly interrupted by the foot traffic.

;(Observe the third, and final suitable spot)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 5 huaian 01.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Here's not too bad... and it's safely away from all the foot traffic. A fitting choice.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 01.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' We've got ourselves a nice spot, now we need to build a proper stall. I've thought about it, and I believe I know roughly how to go about it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 02.ogg}} '''Huai'an:'''  If you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll try to figure out where to start...

:'''''Hui'an starts putting up a simple stall...'''''

:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 03.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' And voila! A little rough around the edges, but it should serve us well. What do you think?
:{{DIcon}} I think you've missed your true calling! Such expert carpentry...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 04.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' It was no big deal! Just a little bit of DIY that I picked up years ago. I've forgotten most of it, actually.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 05.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Well, we can check the stall off our to-do list. It looks quite festive decorated with that Xiao Lantern, wouldn't you say?
:{{DIcon}} You know how to make Xiao Lanterns too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 06.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Well yes, but in my generation, it's just the norm for everyone who grew up in Liyue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 07.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Anyway, speaking of festivities... No celebration is complete without a feast. Do you know what you would like on the menu?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Almond Tofu, that's for sure! We've made it for Xiao before.
:{{DIcon}} And Grilled Tiger Fish.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 08.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Almond Tofu and Grilled Tiger Fish, hmm... What an interesting combination of flavors! I'll have a word with Smiley Yanxiao.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 09.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' He should be able to rustle those up in no time. Luckily, the inn's pantry contains all the necessary ingredients.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 10.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Oh, it's about time to summon our honored guest. Could you fetch him? The food should be ready by the time you come down.

;(Talk to Huai'an again)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 6 huaian 10.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Oh, it's about time to summon our honored guest. Could you fetch him? The food should be ready by the time you come down.

;(Talk to Xiao)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 7 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' What now?
:{{DIcon}} We'd like you to come to Lantern Rite with us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 7 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...We've had the talk about crowded places. Do not make me repeat myself. Best you go alone.
:{{DIcon}} I didn't say you have to go to Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 7 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...What is that supposed to mean?
:{{DIcon}} You wouldn't go to the festival, so we brought the festival to you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 7 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You "brought the festival to me"?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so there's a bunch of delicious snacks just laid out below the inn, and a bunch of Xiao lanterns, and there's practically no one else around to have to worry about.
:{{DIcon}} There's even Almond Tofu and Grilled Tiger Fish...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Better hurry up of the food's gonna go cold. Come on down!
----
;(Upon reaching the seating area)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ta-da! Your very own, miniature Lantern Rite festival! Well if it doesn't look mouth-watering...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' So this is what you meant by bringing the festival to me... *sigh* Is there no end to the peculiarities of human behavior?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Does this serve any grander purpose?
:{{DIcon}} This way you can take part in Lantern Rite.
:{{DIcon}} Lantern Rite is meant to include everyone.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Is that so? Hmph, human motives defy my attempts to fathom them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Less fathoming, more eating! Come on, dig in, before it gets cold!
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mmm-mmm, okay, Paimon's gonna concentrate on eating now.

:'''''Everyone has a nice, leisurely time over the holiday meal...'''''

:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh... Now that we're done with the most important part of the celebration, we should be heading out to see the Mingxiao Lantern.
:{{DIcon}} Come with us, Xiao.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You may take your leave. There's nothing for me over there.
:{{DIcon}} You might as well keep us company on the way there.
:{{DIcon}} O Vigilant Yaksha, please escort us safely to the city.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, the Mingxiao Lantern may not be your thing, but... surely, there's no harm in taking a walk with us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The road from here to Liyue Harbor is long and full of dangers... We need someone to ensure our safety!
:;(Paimon turns to the Traveler, who nods)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nobody says you have to enter the city... You can just see us off at the outskirts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Hmph.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' So be it. I shall accept your proposal.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There you go! Alright, time to hit the road!

;(Talk to Hui'an and Verr Goldet again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj003 huaian 02.ogg}} '''Huai'an:''' Heh, Smiley Yanxiao's no run-of-the-mill chef, huh? Oh, you should visit the city after our meal. You'll just make it in time to see the Mingxiao Lantern being released.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj003 verrgoldet 01.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' I can't believe you managed to talk him into dining with us. That's a first! And I've known him for years...
----
;(Upon arriving at the teleporter nearest to Liyue Harbor)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' This is as far as I will go. Please see yourselves into the city.
:{{DIcon}} Wait a second.
::{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 02a.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' What now?
:{{DIcon}} (...Never mind, he can see it from here.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You are obviously one of the heroes this festival is all about... Why don't you wanna get involved?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I... detest the rabble.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' No cares in the world, so peaceful, so joyful... They are nothing like me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Too long have I spent slaughtering, accompanied by the burden of suffering that follows in its wake. Crossing paths with all those jubilant people will only make me...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...That's all I have to say.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Farewell.
:{{DIcon}} Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Are you really so enamored with such trivial amusements?
:{{DIcon}} What do you think?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! This is a legitimate festival, not some trivial amusement!
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Legitimate...
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Enough. Go watch your lanterns.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' But stay vigilant. Keep your eyes open for any menace. If you find yourself in trouble... speak my name.
:{{DIcon}} Sure you'd make it into the city in time to come to the rescue?
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 12.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Anywhere. Anytime.
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 13.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Whether yours or Liyue's, I hear all cries for help, all prayers for peace, and all the wishes carried by the lanterns.

;(Talk to Xiao again)
:{{A|vo eqhdj003 9 xiao 13.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Whether yours or Liyue's, I hear all cries for help, all prayers for peace, and all the wishes carried by the lanterns.
