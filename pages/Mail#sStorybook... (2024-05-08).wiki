|text      = The storybook that [[Amber]] sent me arrived early! It got here yesterday evening, so I stayed up all night to finish reading it!

The plot was simple enough and easy to understand, and there wasn't any new vocabulary either. The main character, Mr. Fox, has big ears and a long tail, and he lives in a huge forest far, far away. It's a series of funny stories about him and his friends.

I have to admit that I could practically see Master [[Tighnari]] as the protagonist! Or would have, if Mr. Fox wasn't such a sly character who lies at the drop of the hat... I'm not sure how well I hid it when I saw him this morning...

Oh, look how much I've written already! I've gotten a little carried away...

The thing I want to say is... thanks to everyone's help, I've gradually been getting better and better, and I'm starting to feel like I've made a lot of progress!

So, I guess I want to share my gratitude with you, too!
