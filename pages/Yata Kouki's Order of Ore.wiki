'''''Yata Kouki's Order of Ore''''' is a weekly [[Reputation Request]] that occurs in [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
#Give [[Yata Kouki]] five [[White Iron Chunk]]s

==Request Details==
Help Needed:<br />
I can't help but feel that my spear has grown dull.<br />
If it is not sharp enough, I might not be able to unleash my full strength at the key moment.<br />
That will not do, of course: I will not shame the good name of the Tenryou Commission's warriors.<br />
As such, please help me find {{Color|buzzword|5 White Iron Chunks}}. I'll take them to the Amenoma Art's master and get my spear reforged.

:'''Yata Kouki:''' Hello! Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting...
:'''Yata Kouki:''' Wait, who are you? What is your business here?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} You wanted some White Iron Chunks?
::'''Yata Kouki:''' You can't sharpen your blade if it goes blunt in battle. So, best to have Mr. Amenoma make me a shiny new one well in advance.
::'''Yata Kouki:''' Have you taken on my commission? If so, I guess you've got those 5 White Iron Chunks.
::{{DIcon|Quest}} Got 'em.
:::'''Yata Kouki:''' Thanks a million. Please take this as a small token of my gratitude.
