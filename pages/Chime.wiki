'''Chime''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Guns and Wings}}.

She is the daughter of [[Coya]] and granddaughter of [[Chimpu]].                                                                                                                                                               

==Profile==
Chime is the daughter of the [[Qucusaurus]] Coya, who raised her on a remote island near [[Ochkanatlan]], due to Coya's disdain for humans after getting into a quarrel with [[Chasca]]. At some point, Chime was abducted by the merchants led by [[Isidore]], who were hired by [[Allpa]] (under the identity [[Tepal]]) to catch qucusaurs for her experiments. This act enraged Coya and she pursued the merchants to the Flower-Feather village. Coya worked with Chasca to help rescue her daughter, and when confronted by Allpa at Tepal's floating workshop, she revealed an encaged Chime to the group, threatening to harm her if they did not surrender and enter the cages as she attempted her coup.

When Coya expressed a concern that she would do something "unmotherly" to her, Chime was supportive of her action and told her to do it. Coya rammed Allpa and the two reunited after safely removing the relic from Ochkanatlan, before the former collapsed from old injuries acting up. Chasca took the two back to the village so she could get a check-up, while Chime and Chimpu arrived to check in on her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Time for the Showdown}}</ref>

Chime later interacted and played with the tribe's children while watched over by Chasca, who was reminded of how she and Coya would do the same when they were young.

===Appearance===
Chime is a [[Qucusaurus Chick]].
