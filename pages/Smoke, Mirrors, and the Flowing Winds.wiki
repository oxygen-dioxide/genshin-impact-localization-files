|info          = While in an area with [[Phlogiston]] Mechanics within [[Natlan]], can use [[Nightsoul Transmission]]: Citlali. When the active character is currently high enough in the air, the following will trigger when switching to Citlali: Citlali will leap up high, and will deploy "White Obsidian Tzitzimitl: Citlalin" to float in the air. Nightsoul Transmission can be triggered once every 10s by your party.<br><br>Holding [[Aiming Mode]] will cause Citlali to enter the "Spiritspeaker" state, which will allow her to interact with "[[Nightspirit Graffiti]]" and "[[Nightspirit Sigil]]s," extracting information and power from them. The rules for interacting with these objects follow the same rules as those governing [[Iktomisaurus]] interactions.<br><br>Additionally, holding the jump button will cause Citlali to consume 75 [[Stamina]] and leap. In areas within Natlan where Phlogiston mechanics are present, Citlali will prioritize consuming 5 Phlogiston to leap to a height higher still.<br><br>When in the air, Citlali can Hold her [[Shadow-Stealing Spirit Vessel|Normal Attack]] to consume Phlogiston or Stamina and enter Aiming Mode and trigger Charged Attacks. When initiating Charged Attacks in mid-air, Citlali will prioritize consuming 20 Phlogiston.
