{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Baishu:''' May everyone enjoy good health, booming businesses, rewarding careers, wealth, and success!
:{{DIcon}} Truly refined! May wealth find you, too!
::'''Baishu:''' Thank you!
::'''Baishu:''' Judging by your appearance... You must be a noble! Maybe one who's achieved extreme wealth a long time ago!
::'''Baishu:''' If you ever decide to expand in Yilong Wharf, you can count on me to help with anything you may need!
:{{DIcon}} You are?
::'''Baishu:''' I'm Baishu, the owner of [[Jiulue Teahouse]].
::'''Baishu:''' Many of the nearby inns are under my name as well. Rest assured, you can leave your food and accommodation in Yilong Wharf to my staff.
::{{DIcon}} Your business is really prospering!
::'''Baishu:''' You're too kind! I was merely lucky to ride the wave of industrial upgrading.
::'''Baishu:''' Once upon a time, I was a very ordinary tea farmer who grew mediocre tea.
::'''Baishu:''' It's all thanks to the inspiration I received from Master [[Jiuguan]] that my fortunes took a drastic change for the better!
::'''Baishu:''' When the primary tea-making equipment in Chenyu Vale was being upgraded from classic tea cauldrons to machinery, I caught wind and took advantage of that early adoption to accumulate a substantial amount of funds.
::'''Baishu:''' I started a teahouse with those funds and soon expanded to inns and restaurants.
::'''Baishu:''' After visiting my teahouses, restaurants, and inns, foreign guests often purchase some tea leaves to try back at home or as a gift.
::'''Baishu:''' I failed to be an outstanding tea farmer, but I fully intend to provide financial support and publicity to my former colleagues...
::'''Baishu:''' I'm quite satisfied with where my career's gone now, so my next goal is to help more business people, just like Master Jiuguan!
:{{DIcon}} (Nod and leave)
::'''Baishu:''' Your presence is unfathomable! I look forward to meeting you again!
