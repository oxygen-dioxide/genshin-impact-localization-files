'''Stamen of Khvarena's Origin''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Vourukasha's Glow]].

==Description==
"My innocent daughter, my Khvarena..."<br>
"[[Nabu Malikata|I]] shall give you unto [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|another mother]]. Love her, and be loyal to her."<br>
"She is no less than I, and her light is yet more radiant than mine."<br>
"I once encountered a [[Cataclysm|faceless nightmare]] in my dreams, and it frightened me to no end."<br>
"And so I separated you from my body, and I ask you now to prevent that nightmare's coming."

"My Khvarena, the light of my eyes..."<br>
"I once warned her of the coming of the dark tide, and it is from this that your destiny arises."<br>
"Please do not be afraid, and do not flee, do not let your Khvarena dim, and do not disgrace your mother."<br>
"Just as it is my fate to sacrifice myself for mortals, so too is sacrifice the beautiful prelude to new life..."<br>
"Go now, into your verdant mother's embrace. You shall find your destiny in her realm."

"My Khvarena, my pure daughter..."<br>
"You shall change utterly. You shall face the trial of division and death."<br>
"And after that, you shall become immortal — and yet that shall be a harder road still..."<br>
"The [[Egeria|lord of sweet dew]] and the lord of grass and trees shall precede you in losing their divine forms..."<br>
"They shall be forgotten, and only the memory of your sacrifice will be remembered."

"My Khvarena, daughter of flowers..."<br>
"If you are resolved to not retreat out of fear..."<br>
"Then throw yourself into the embrace of your new mistress."
