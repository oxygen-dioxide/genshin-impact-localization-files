|description = A peculiar bird that can walk on two feet yet cannot spread its wings to fly. Lively and friendly, they are often found in habitats close to water in groups, or floating on their backs in the water without a care in the world.<br>Flowcurrent Birds are shaped like a thin-necked bottle, swaying unsteadily as they walk, its wings fluttering clumsily. Due to their relative friendliness towards all other creatures, their lack of aggression even when angry, and the fact that even adult Flowcurrent Birds are no taller or heavier than a human child, the [[People of the Springs]] are quite happy to let their children play with them...
}}
