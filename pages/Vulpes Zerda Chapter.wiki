'''Vulpes Zerda Chapter''' is [[Tighnari]]'s [[Story Quest]].

==Act I: The Unanswerable Problems==
{{Description|A contaminated area that seems to differ from the Withering Zone is spreading through Avidya Forest, disturbing the thoughts of many who pass through the area.<br />You take great pains to be fully prepared before you delve into this area, but your hard-come-by guide turns out to be a mechanical crab who cannot communicate with you.<br />Yet, is any one life greater than another? Perhaps its cold outer shield may yet hide thoughts that shall coalesce into a beating heart.}}
