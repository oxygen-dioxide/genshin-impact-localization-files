:{{DIcon|Shop}} Yes.
::'''Jut:''' No problem, just let me know when you've made your decision.
:;(Opens the Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Jut:''' I'm a spice merchant. I mainly provide locals with spices for their daily needs, but I also sell some spiced-up side dishes.
::'''Jut:''' Some researchers even come personally to gather the spices.
::'''Jut:''' I even got a source for rare Padisarahs through a friend in [[the Eremites]]. Come to me if you need some.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I see someone's pretty well connected.
:::'''Jut:''' Hehe, you flatter me... It's just that I often sent gifts to my guests when I first started out, so they were willing to tell others about my store to help my business.
:::'''Jut:''' Business is all about treating people with sincerity, you know.
:::'''Jut:''' Is this your first time here? Here, take these. I hope they can bring a different flavor to your table.
::;(Obtain [[Padisarah]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Maybe next time.
::'''Jut:''' No problem, come back any time.
