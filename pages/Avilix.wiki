==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Avilix:''' All rocks are precious, even if they might trip you when you're out on a walk.
:{{DIcon}} Mind telling me about your tribe?
::'''Avilix:''' The Children of Echoes? Ah, this is the tribe right here.
::'''Avilix:''' Pretty cozy, right? This is the home where we grew up. We've always been surrounded by music, dance, and incredibly chubby Tepetlisaurs.
::'''Avilix:''' The only problem is that we've dug too deep into the mountains, so sometimes, it's hard to get a good amount of sun. But that's fine &mdash; the people here are rowdy enough that you'll never feel lonely.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about "rocks"...
::'''Avilix:''' The Tepetlisaurs are great at digging, so by living alongside them, we're basically living alongside rocks and ore.
::'''Avilix:''' Oh, and besides those, we've also got solid phlogiston! You know what phlogiston is, right? You're already been here a while, after all.
::'''Avilix:''' That's especially true for the Children of Echoes. Gems are really important to us &mdash; we see them almost like a second layer of our skin.
::'''Avilix:''' If you want to live and work in Natlan, know this: the more gems someone is wearing, the harder they are to deal with.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Looks like I'll have to go get some.
::'''Avilix:''' Haha, don't you worry. We're not the type to look down on anyone who doesn't come bedecked in gems.
::'''Avilix:''' Here, take this. This is a Crystal Fruit common to these parts &mdash; hope it brings you good luck.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Spinel Fruit|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} About the aftermath of the war...
:;(Available after completing ''[[No One Fights Alone]]''){{Verify}}
::'''Avilix:''' Ah, thank you for your concern. The reconstruction work is progressing at a steady pace, and our stockpile of gemstones and equipment is finally being put to good use.
::'''Avilix:''' Some of our warriors were injured, while others are now gone... It is a great pity. You may notice that some familiar faces in Natlan are no longer to be seen.
::'''Avilix:''' But you needn't look sad. They fought for the glory of Natlan, and their sacrifice was not in vain.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Avilix:''' See you around, and watch your step.
