;(Talk to Quilla and [[Paran]] prior to completing ''From One Case to Another'')
:'''Paran:''' Sorry, Ms. Quilla. Carrewoof didn't hurt you, did he? He isn't usually nearly that enthusiastic towards strangers.
:'''Quilla:''' Haha, I'm fine. I love interacting with animals. If anything, the affection makes me happy.
:'''Quilla:''' By the way, [[Hawka]] misses you a lot. When he heard that I would be coming here soon, he had me ask about how you've been doing.
:'''Paran:''' ...Uncle Hawka? Why would be{{sic}} care about me? Ugh, I'm sorry, we've had some clashes, but they aren't worth mentioning...
