==Profile==
Fietena was a member of the [[Collective of Plenty]] who later got married into the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]. She contributed to uniting and protecting the tribes of [[Natlan]] after their [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]] had gone into the [[Sacred Flame]] and the council went on quarreling over control.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Vivid Notions}}</ref>

Fietena had followed [[Wanjiru]] when she was little, listening to the latter recounting heroic legends. She had never received an [[Ancient Name]] either, but together with other warriors of her generation such as [[Traore]] and [[Nzambe]], she bravely safeguarded Natlan during the decade following their Pyro Archon's departure, until the calamity waned and the [[Abyss]]al contamination from battles took a heavy toll on her body as she aged. By then, she passed the torch to [[Taika]], who was likewise a follower of her and would become the mightiest warrior of the Flower-Feather Clan, with the [[Demon-Warrior's Feather Mask]] given to him as her token.

She was a renowned wrestler, with stories circulating that she could send lightning bolts back into the sky and in the worst days of the war, she managed to fight off the enemy while eating moldy [[Tatacos]] and meat that was practically charcoal.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Varesa|When Thunder Strikes}}<br/>{{Ref/VO|Varesa|Least Favorite Food}}</ref> According to [[Varesa]], Fietena's most iconic feature was her mask, though she is implied to have changed its design at least once.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Varesa|Something to Share|quote=My intuition told me to base it on the mask that Fietena wore on her second time fighting in the Night Warden Wars.}}</ref>
