{{Lang|'''Teppei'''|ja=哲平}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that played a major role in the [[Chapter II]] Archon Quests. He first appeared in Act II: [[Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow]].

In Act III: [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], he died due to the life-draining effects of a [[Delusion|Fatui Delusion]].

==Profile==
Teppei is a member of the [[Watatsumi Army]] that fought against the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s oppressive rule and [[Vision Hunt Decree]]. He first served in the logistics division before being sent to the front lines and assigned to the Gobius Platoon.

===Story===
While Teppei is at [[Nazuchi Beach]], [[Yoriki Samurai]] attack him. The [[Traveler]] arrives in time to save him. Surprised by their ability to control the elements without a [[Vision]], Teppei decides to bring the Traveler to the resistance camp at [[Fort Fujitou]] and introduce them to [[Gorou|General Gorou]]. After a tour around the camp, Teppei joins the Traveler in a battle against the Shogunate forces led by [[Kujou Sara]]. The resistance is victorious with the arrival of [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] and hired mercenaries, upon which she asks the Traveler to meet her at [[Sangonomiya Shrine]]. Teppei offers to continue being a guide for the Traveler. The Traveler and Teppei later rendezvous with each other and set off to Watatsumi Island by sea.

During the meeting with Kokomi at the Sangonomiya Shrine, Teppei is shocked when she appoints the Traveler as the new captain of the Swordfish II unit. Wishing to show his worth in battle, Kokomi grants his request by allowing him to participate in a battle against the Shogun's Navy. Teppei's achievements during the battle land him a position as the captain of the newly formed Herring I unit.

At one point, Teppei meets some [[Fatui|mysterious people]] claiming to be supporters who then give him a "secret weapon" and is unaware that it is a [[Delusion]]. As he continues using the "weapon", he grows inexplicably weak. Teppei believes he is only exhausted from battle. After realizing that the Fatui had been supporting the resistance with Delusions, the Traveler rushes to Teppei to see that he had significantly aged. He soon succumbs to the Delusion's effects and dies.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Delusion (Quest)}}</ref>

===Personality===
Teppei, like all other members of the resistance, opposed the Raiden Shogun's Vision Hunt Decree. Despite the dangers at the front lines, Teppei voluntarily chose to move from logistics so he could show his worth in battle, although like many of his comrades, he was not particularly skilled. He envied the Traveler's progress and wishes to surpass them by any means possible, although this and his desire to prove himself would eventually prove fatal.

===Appearance===
Teppei wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it.

When Teppei aged from the Delusion's effects, he has light gray hair and wrinkles on his face.
