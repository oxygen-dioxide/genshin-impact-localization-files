'''Wildlife''' are a type of [[NPC]] that function similarly to [[Enemies]] encountered throughout [[Teyvat]]. Most Wildlife will be [[startled]] and flee when a player approaches them.

Wildlife can be categorized into three sub-types by their interactability: uninteractable pets (cats and dogs), wildlife that drop items (birds and beasts), and wildlife that act as an interactable item pick-up (material sources). Creatures which function as interactables will not drop their loot upon death, but instead just disappear with a cloud of smoke. Fish are an exception, as they can be both killed to drop items and directly picked up.

Wildlife that drop items, besides fish, trigger weapon passives on hit, e.g., [[Sacrificial Series|Composed]], [[The Flute|Chord]]. Artifact passives will not be triggered, e.g., [[Pale Flame]]'s 4-Piece bonus, [[Tenacity of the Millelith]]'s 4-Piece bonus. Some character talent passives will trigger, e.g., [[Sparkling Scatter]]. Some character talent passives will not trigger, e.g., [[Cold-Blooded Strike]].
