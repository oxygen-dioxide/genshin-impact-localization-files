|text    = This is the final day of the year.

Thinking back upon the years past at this time never fails to make me sigh. Mortal lives are like fish swimming amidst the rapids, or like vegetation growing beneath boulders.

They are weak yet strong, transient yet timeless... truly inscrutable.

This year has been one of many more changes than usual.

Of these variables, meeting you was the most memorable.

How will someone as unique as yourself spend days of birth?

I am well-apprised of the more common practices, but I am curious as to your method of celebration.

I am still getting used to a simple life such as this. It is a shame, but idle days do not seem to pass more easily than hectic ones.

Would you happen to have a day free? I would like to take a stroll.

With your companionship, perhaps even familiar sights may yet appear new once more.
