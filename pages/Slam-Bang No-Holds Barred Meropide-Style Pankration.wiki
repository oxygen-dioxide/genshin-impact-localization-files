'''''Slam-Bang No-Holds Barred Meropide-Style Pankration''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player must complete the {{Quest|Both Brains and Brawn}}.

==Trivia==
*The achievement's name is a reference to the history of professional wrestling. The term "No-Holds Barred" originated as a disclaimer for legitimate {{W|catch wrestling}} contests in the late 1800s, whilst "Slam-Bang Western-Style" was the term coined by the {{W|Gold Dust Trio}} in the early 1900s when they reinvented the sport into a predetermined performance art.
*This duality is reflected in the quest; {{W|Pankration}} itself was a notoriously violent real-world combat sport in Ancient Greece, yet [[Roussimoff]] emphasizes the importance of entertaining the audience like in modern wrestling.
