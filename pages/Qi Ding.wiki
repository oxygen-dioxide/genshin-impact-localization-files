{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Qi Ding)
:'''Qi Ding:''' Oh? If it isn't (Traveler) and Paimon!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... What's with him? He smells of gunpowder!
:'''Qi Ding:''' Huh? Do I really smell that much? Oh well, guess I'll have to take a bath when I return home. My [[Qi Nan|daughter]] will give me an earful if I don't...
