|text      = The new tea I had someone bring from [[Chenyu Vale]] in [[Liyue]] the other day has finally arrived.

The buds and leaves are just unfurling, and they are of a deep, emerald hue &mdash; naturally, such fine tea should be savored with equally fine friends.

I've also often heard that new tea is best enjoyed with old friends, and that you, old friend, are quite knowledgeable about fine teas from various regions... If it is convenient for you, why not come visit the [[Kamisato Estate]] for a small gathering?

Don't worry, tonight's affair is a family dinner, bereft of tedious formalities. [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]] and [[Thoma]] are already prepared and awaiting your arrival.

Come to think of it, we've played that hotpot game far too many times. If you'd like to try something novel, why don't we base our entertainment around tea this time?
