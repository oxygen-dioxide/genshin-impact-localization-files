{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon entering the area)
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Is Fischl waiting for us?
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' The time has finally come. Though it brings mein Fräulein no joy to do so, there is something she must announce to the assembled populous.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' My loyal servants, one must bid you adieu till such time as I beckon you once more. Though we have faced many trials and tribulations together, you have all shown commendable courage in the course of duty. I feel a breeze now blows upon this place... and I feel that it blows in your honor.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whaaaat? You're just gonna bail on us!?
:{{DIcon}} Fischl, are you leaving?
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 oz 02.ogg}} '''Oz:''' With the arrival of this giant meteorite, many more people have succumbed to the slumber. Strong as the soldiers may be, they are struggling to cope, and there is demand for volunteers everywhere we turn.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 oz 03.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein and I shall tend to the victims on the soldiers' behalf. The rest of this investigation we place in your capable hands.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 fischl 02.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' ...Goodbye, (Traveler).
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 fischl 03.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' You are a good listener. ...I enjoy chatting with you.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 fischl 04.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' To be honest, most of the other adventurers in the Guild only ever talk to me when they wanna hear Oz's reconnaissance reports...
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 fischl 05.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' This little journey we had... it was a great adventure. I'm just sorry that it has to end so abruptly...
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You're talking a little weirder than you normally do...
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 fischl 06.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' !!!
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 fischl 07.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' (Yikes!!! What am I doing? I totally broke form...)
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 oz 04.ogg}} '''Oz:''' What mein Fräulein means to say, is... is... is that the mystical mysteries that vex and perplex are bound to be effortlessly extinguished by the advent of your commendable courage and wondrous wisdom.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... And now Oz's translation is the one that sounds all kooky.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 oz 05.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Ahem... Mein Fräulein simply wishes to say that she has every confidence that you will arrive at the truth of this matter.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 fischl 08.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Ahem! Most indeed... My dear attendants, I hereby charge the Ritter der Verurteilung with leading you out from the darkness, back into the realm of light.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Who are you calling your "attendant..."
:{{DIcon}} Thank you Oz, and thank you Fischl.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 oz 06.ogg}} '''Oz:''' We will meet again. Once this matter is concluded, I propose that we all get a drink together.
:;(Oz and Fischl leave the scene)
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Well, now we're two people short.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But let's not get hung up about that. The good news is, I've found something else out.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I shaved some dust off the meteorite and used it to do another reading. It was actually really effective!
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' These rocks have been around for hundreds, maybe even thousands of years. Leonard must have lived a very long time ago.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The meteorites carry his will, and can pass it on others. In other words, centuries on from Leonard's life, and the strength of his will has not diminished one bit.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' A guy from the distant past with a burning ambition to scale the highest mountain... I'd be willing to bet that he was an adventurer, just like you.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An adventurer? That does explain his obsession with mountain climbing!
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Our approach so far has been too passive, and time has been against us every step of the way. We need to change our strategy, and we need to attack this problem at its source.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon agrees! From now on, we need to put Leonard at the center of everything we do.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Yes... Because if the meteorites carry Leonard's will with them, then it's precisely as Fischl said: the rocks are, in a sense, a curse...
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I'm a little incredulous, but it turns out her blind guess was actually spot on... Ugh, no, I'm a respectable astrologist, and I shouldn't stoop to that kind of criticism.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 mona 11.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Anyway. All we need to do now is remove the curse.
:{{DIcon}} Come on Paimon, let's go.
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okie-dokie!
:{{A|vo eqast004 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Since we've got a historical adventurer on our hands, Paimon thinks we should pay a visit to the {{Color|buzzword|[[Adventurers' Guild]]}}.
----
;(Talk to Katheryne)
:{{A|vo eqast004 2 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Our records show that there have been many adventurers by that name over the years, it is impossible to know which one you refer to.
:{{A|vo eqast004 2 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' However, I do recall that there is a book in the library authored by someone called [[Leonard]]. Perhaps you should take a look?
----
;(Upon checking Lisa's desk)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Library Index
:{{A|vo eqast004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Author, Leonard... Where are you, Leonard... Aha! Gotcha!
:{{A|vo eqast004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The index says that Leonard's book should be in the {{Color|buzzword|north-west corner}} on the {{Color|buzzword|top floor}} of the library.
:{{A|vo eqast004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' North-west corner... Should be right over there.
----
;(Upon collecting [[Of Mountains and Seas]] book)
:{{A|vo eqast004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Found it! [["Of Mountains and Seas"]], A Guide for Adventurers, written by Leonard!
;(Observing the book of unreadable texts)
:{{A|vo eqast004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the words have faded and there are even pages missing... Paimon's got no hope of reading this.
:{{A|vo eqast004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Darn... Maybe we're just wasting our time on this one?
:{{DIcon}} Don't give up. Let's see what Mona says.
:{{A|vo eqast004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right, yeah! Mona! She might have a better idea.
----
;(Talk to Mona)
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look what we found, Leonard wrote a book!
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Ooh! Let me see!
:{{DIcon}} It's quite incoherent as there is lots missing.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Hm! I could have predicted as much...
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Your average astrologist would definitely give up at this point.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But I am Mona, progenitor of the future of astrology. Nothing can stand in my way.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I simply need to deduce the missing portions with my astrolabe, write them in, and then decipher the text...
:'''''Mona studies the book intently...'''''
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Phew! Finished at last...
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what does it say?
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Just as I thought, Leonard was an adventurer who lived two thousand years ago.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' His lifelong dream was to reach the summit of a mountain called [[Musk Reef|Pilos Peak]].
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Two thousand years? So the constellation that caused the meteorites is from two thousand years ago!?
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Somehow, for some reason, this constellation was summoned down from the sky. I suspect that the [[Fatui]] have something to do with that part.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too. Whenever something shady happens, you can bet the Fatui are involved.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The meteorites harbor elemental energy, which radiates out and lulls people to sleep by some means akin to hypnosis.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 11.ogg}} '''Mona:''' And if I'm guessing correctly, there should be some sort of core meteorite among the bunch, within which is a crystal that harbors Leonard's spirit.
:{{DIcon}} How will we find it?
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 12.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Well, if I were Leonard, I would want to make sure the core lands right on the snowy summit that I never made it to while I was alive.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the core should be at the top of Pilos Peak? Where is that? Paimon's never heard of it before.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 13.ogg}} '''Mona:''' It's the first I'd heard of it too, so I compared the map from the book against the current topography of Mondstadt. Apparently, Pilos Peak no longer exists.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you trying to say that the tallest mountain Paimon's never heard of just... disappeared!?
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 14.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I once read somewhere that the Anemo [[Archon]], [[Barbatos]], once used his divine power to mobilize the winds and blow the ice and snow from the face of the earth. The whole landscape of Mondstadt was changed in the process.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 15.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The mountains of that age were replaced by the vast stretch of ocean we see today. Still, a mountain that high? Drop it into the ocean and it'll still leave a trace.
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 16.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The summit still reaches just above the water's surface. So, the place known as Pilos Peak in Leonard's day is today known...
:{{A|vo eqast004 6 mona 17.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...as {{Color|buzzword|"Musk Reef."}}
----
;(Upon entering the area)
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Ho? So this is Pilos Peak? Not much to show for itself now, eh?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like someone beat us here.. Is this, like, a popular tourist spot, or...
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! It's you!
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Ugh... Huh? You again?
:{{DIcon}} How did you find this place?
:{{DIcon}} Have you just woken up?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look at the state he's in... Was he in that dream just now?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' He managed to extricate himself from the dream on his own strength? How is that possible?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Hah! Just because you are powerless to do something does not mean that I am.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' You're too late, anyway. I've finished my research.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We knew it! This was all a dirty trick by the [[Fatui]]!
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Save it. No more fun and games for me today. I'll come for you when I'm good and ready.
:{{DIcon}} Wait! What are you trying to achieve?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' You entered the dream they've all been having, didn't you? How much do you know about Leonard?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 05.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Leonard? Who's Leonard? ...Ugh, whatever! I have bigger fish to fry!
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 06.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' I've discovered something far more important... and far more terrifying.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What?
:{{DIcon}} What is it?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 07.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The stars are a lie? What are you talking about?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this some kind of astrological debate between you and Mona? Because if so, surely you can come up with a better argument than "The stars are a lie."
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously, who's gonna fall for that one when you can just lift your head up at night and see them up there, twinkling away?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 08.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Hah... Hahahahaha! Oh, you are so naive, it kills me!
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 09.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Still... Can't really blame you. After all, I used to believe the same thing myself &mdash; up until a few moments ago, that is...
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' A few moments ago? You mean...
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 10.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Look &mdash; I really don't have the time to do this right now.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 11.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' What was [[Pierro|the Jester]] thinking? He must have had some inkling of what we might discover on this mission... Would it really have been so difficult to give me a little forewarning? Hmph, or maybe he just wanted to give me a fright...
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 scaramouche 12.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Time for me to go out and find the truth. So long, suckers!
----
;(Traveler enters into combat with Mona alongside against two Pyroslinger Bracers)
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Ugh, can you believe that guy? He calls us suckers, and then he just trots off!
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' No one disrespects me, no one! Agh! Time to show them what you get when you cross world-class genius with pure, unadulterated rage!
----
;(After defeating the Fatui agents)
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, you fought so fiercely!
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Told you! That's what happens when you disrespect me!
:{{DIcon}} Mona, you are a force to be reckoned with.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' You bet I am! Paimon, you agree too, right? Did I show those Fatui who's boss or what?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure did! Without you here, those guys would have caused us a whole lot more trouble!
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' See! How do you like that, [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Harbinger]]! Scumbag...
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 11.ogg}} '''Mona:''' He seemed genuinely shaken, though. I don't think he was lying. I was always taught to talk about the "false sky" during astrological readings... Could there be more to such phrases than I have been led to believe?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 12.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...Ahem. I digress. Come on, let's finish the job we came to do.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The core has gotta be round here somewhere!
----
;(Upon approaching the meteorite core)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Destroy the meteorite core
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this must be the core... It looks totally different from all the other meteorites! It's way more... shiny.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 13.ogg}} '''Mona:''' This stone harbors an unbelievable amount of elemental energy, and human desire. It's the core alright.
:{{DIcon}} Should we... destroy it?
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 mona 14.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Yes. Otherwise, the victims will never wake up... This core is the root cause of everything that has happened.
:{{A|vo eqast004 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do it, (Traveler)!
;([[#Cutscene|Cutscene]] plays, Leonard narrates)
:'''Leonard:''' With ropes, we can scale mountains.
:'''Leonard:''' With boats, we can sail the seas.
:'''Leonard:''' By age 40, I had conquered every last domain
:'''Leonard:''' Pilos Peak alone defeated me... as an adventurer, and well, maybe in other ways too.
:'''Leonard:''' Now, I am approaching the end of my life.
:'''Leonard:''' Many times I have sat and stared up at that peak as the boundless snow slowly engulfed me.
:'''Leonard:''' It is a beast without weakness, the merciless face of the world.
:'''Leonard:''' It fills me with fear... and when an adventurer loses courage, they can no longer climb mountains.
:'''Leonard:''' My mountaineering days may be over, but I have a greater ambition now.
:'''Leonard:''' Humans create tools to conquer nature, and when nature conquers them in return, they create better tools.
:'''Leonard:''' Where our legs cannot take us, maybe our tools can. And when tools fail us, perhaps wings can carry us instead.
:'''Leonard:''' My dear friend, I leave you my designs for the "Wings of Incompletion".
:'''Leonard:''' Against the unknown, humanity stands as one.
:'''Leonard:''' To be alive is to seek, to set foot in every place that the eye can see.
:'''Leonard:''' I have little time remaining, though the wind has not yet come for my soul.
:'''Leonard:''' But between us and your children, students, and friends, I believe someone will reach that place at last.
;(Cutscene ends)
----
:{{A|Vo eqast004 11 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Wow. Well, that was unexpected...
:{{DIcon}} A climber, determined to reach the highest peak.
:{{DIcon}} Determination so strong, he wished to pass it on to others.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Who would have thought that human will can survive in the skies for millennia on end...
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Astrology really is an incredible thing!
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...What makes you say that?
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The ability to communicate with the stars can give you access to all the secrets from throughout human history... Though of course, very few astrologists ever reach that level.
:{{DIcon}} Mona, thank you ever so much for all of your assistance.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Uh... What's with the formal tone all of a sudden?
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' And speaking of formal tone... What is the deal with that girl, Fischl? She's a curious one.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so, too! She's soooo... How to put this...
:{{DIcon}} She's full of weird and wonderful thoughts.
:{{DIcon}} She has a wild imagination.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Although, if you think about it... Seems she was right all along.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is she one of these people who uses the wrong method but still gets the right answer?
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' You may well be right.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even so, Paimon thinks that the most surprising thing of all was how Pilos Peak turned into a teeny-tiny little island!
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' A mountain of yesteryear now sits as an island in the sea. Almost anyone from Mondstadt could reach it now, just by jumping in a boat.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In other words, everyone can climb Pilos Peak now.
:{{DIcon}} Everyone can stand on top of the mountain.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' D'you think Leonard would be happy about it? The situation with Pilos Peak might be a bit of a shock... but now, with the help of the Anemo Archon, the people of Mondstadt are able to glide.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With wings, people can travel further and higher than ever beforem and explore new and unknown places.
:{{DIcon}} (Leonard, is your wish now fulfilled?)
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The victims should finally start waking up now that we've dealt with the core.
:{{A|vo eqast004 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And we have finally finished our commission from the Adventurers' Guilds!
:{{DIcon}} I wish everyone a speedy recovery.

*In the Japanese dub, Oz first proposes to drink ''{{w|Sake}}'', an alcoholic beverage, before correcting himself to go for tea once the events of the meteorites conclude.
