:'''Fodil:''' Hello.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Fodil/Visit Denied|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Fodil:''' It's alright. I play pretty often in my downtime. Losing to me is no big deal.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Fodil:''' Not bad! I'd say you're one of the best players out here in the desert!
:{{DIcon}} So, what's up ahead?
::'''Fodil:''' It depends what you mean by "up ahead."
::'''Fodil:''' On one side, you have Aaru Village. As you can see, it is a village bordering the desert, and is home to us, the people of the desert.
::'''Fodil:''' Though we are cut off by the [[Wall of Samiel]], this is still a safe place that welcomes those who wish for rest.
::'''Fodil:''' Travel can be exhausting, and the desert is perilous. If you wish to stop for rest during your journey, this is the place to be.
::{{DIcon}} What about the other side?
::'''Fodil:''' That place is unfamiliar to me.
::'''Fodil:''' When I was still working with [[the Eremites]], I did go to [[Port Ormos]] several times, but all the work we got usually involved... kicking people while they were down.
::'''Fodil:''' I decided it wasn't for me, so I left. I've never left the village since then.
::'''Fodil:''' The only things I learned there that are worth mentioning are things I learned from the school of hard knocks.
::'''Fodil:''' And well, now I use them to protect the village. That suits me just fine.
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me more about yourself?
::'''Fodil:''' If you're looking to get some intel on the pretext of small talk, then you've come to the wrong person.
::'''Fodil:''' In any case, Aaru Village has never been home to any secrets.
::'''Fodil:''' This is a place of exile for the [[Akademiya]]. Most people struggle to even make ends meet &mdash; never mind have any manner of strange thoughts.
::'''Fodil:''' Secondly, we, the desert people, consider this place our final home. We will defend it no matter the cost.
::'''Fodil:''' So it doesn't matter what your reasons are &mdash; if you threaten the stability of the village, we, the Aaru Village guards, will take action against you without a second thought.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah.
::'''Fodil:''' Good. Safe travels, then.
