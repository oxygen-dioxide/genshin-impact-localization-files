'''Decarabian's Mondstadt''', commonly referred to as '''Old Mondstadt''', was the original location of the nation of [[Mondstadt]]. It was created by the [[God]] of Storms, [[Decarabian]], who built his capital city within a deep valley and created a large tower from which he ruled. His reign ended 2,600 years ago, when his people rebelled against him and ultimately slew him.<ref name="Venti4"/><ref name="AB">{{Ref/Weapon|Amos' Bow}}</ref> Afterwards, the newly crowned Anemo Archon, [[Barbatos]], moved the people of Mondstadt to [[Cider Lake]], where the current-day [[City of Mondstadt]] was built.

During the [[cataclysm]] five hundred years ago, [[Dvalin]] took up residence in Decarabian's tower to recover from the injuries incurred during his battle against [[Durin]]. In subsequent years, after the people of Mondstadt forgot about Dvalin, the area of Old Mondstadt became known as [[Stormterror's Lair]].

==History==
Little is known about the initial creation of Mondstadt, but Decarabian's City is described as a "dream of prosperity" which was "created entirely by his divine might."<ref>{{Ref/Item|Tile of Decarabian's Tower}}</ref> His territory spread to the [[Brightcrown Mountains]] and [[Windwail Highland]] areas to the east and south, as evidenced by the ornamentation on some of the ruins in the area. Besides Decarabian's City, notable cloisters of ruins in its ornamentation style include the ruins in [[Brightcrown Canyon]] leading into the city, and the ruins around [[Cecilia Garden]].

When the region of Mondstadt was blanketed in snow and ice as a result of [[Boreas]]' powers,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Spirit Locket of Boreas}}</ref> Decarabian created an impenetrable storm wall around his capital city to protect those dwelling within from the bitter cold.<ref name="Venti4">{{Ref/CS|Venti|4}}</ref>

===Architecture and Design===
The architectural style of the ruins in Decarabian's Mondstadt is quite distinct from those found in the rest of modern-day Mondstadt, making it easy to identify ruins outside of the Stormterror's Lair area that are related to it.

Tall bridges are a distinctive feature within Decarabian's City and in the surrounding area.

Notably, the ruins associated with Decarabian's style lack [[Symbols in Teyvat|symbols]] otherwise commonly seen in Teyvat, such as the [[triquetra]]. Instead, a symbol seen on ruins of Decarabian's Mondstadt is a {{w|cercelée}}, a type of cross with curled-in ends. The ornamental designs seen on bridges, pillars, and walls are {{w|margent}}s, or plant-like motifs, rather than the Celtic knots commonly seen on ruins throughout Teyvat. (In a similar vein, the [[Wolf of the North]] arena in [[Wolvendom]] is decorated with {{w|Arabesque}}s, another type of plant-like design, rather than Celtic knots.)

The structural integrity of Decarabian's ruins are apparently quite sturdy despite their age, remaining in rather good condition in the 2,600 years since its fall. [[Alice]] destroyed several arcades inside the tower to make it easier to climb, and the tower has remained stable despite that.<ref name="TTG">{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|1}}</ref>

===Organization===
Decarabian micromanaged his city, to the point of arranging who lived where.<ref name="TTG" /> Even in the present, the residential area of the city is clearly delineated, suggesting that the city's layout was also something Decarabian determined.

===Music===
Under Decarabian's rule, certain tunes and chords were banned due to their association with dissent and rebellion.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Song of Broken Pines}}</ref>

==Geography==
Based on the similarity between ruin structures as well as in-game documentation, the original scope of Old Mondstadt's territory encompassed the Brightcrown Mountains and Windwail Highland areas, and went as far south as the [[Teleport Waypoint]] between Liyue and Dawn Winery. It is currently unknown how far north or west it covered.

The most well-known settlement of Decarabian's Mondstadt was his capital city, located in the area now known as Stormterror's Lair.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Debris of Decarabian's City}}</ref> It is located within an extremely deep, possibly manmade valley; it is currently one of the deepest locations on the explorable part of the [[Teyvat]] map.
