'''Cherries Snow-Laden''' is a 4-Star [[Character Outfit]] for [[Hu Tao]]. It is purchasable from the [[Character Outfit Shop]].

During [[Version 5.3]], Cherries Snow-Laden was available at a [[Cherries Snow-Laden Discount|limited-time discount]] of {{Item|Genesis Crystal|30|x=1,350}}. In [[Version 5.4]], its cost was increased to {{Item|Genesis Crystal|30|x=1,680}}.

==Appearance==
Hu Tao's hair is styled into long twin tails looped at the roots with curly ends. Her bangs are side-swept to her left, with two shoulder-length locks of hair in front of her ears left loose. She wears a white beret hat and round glasses with red lens.

Hu Tao wears a white halterneck hanfu dress, with a front slit fastened by [[wikipedia:Frog (fastening)|frogs]], which reveals a pleated skirt in red with plum flower embellishment. She wears a pair of detached bishop sleeves in matching color, covered by a red overcoat with gold trim, split at the back where her {{Pyro}} [[Vision]] is fixated. She also wears a loose shawl in dark brown, tied around the mandarin collar with a tasseled cherry blossom. Her look is completed with sheer thigh-highs, red ombre nails, multiple rings, and roll-top boots in white and red.

==Description==
The seasons turned, the days grew chill, and winter lay thick on [[Liyue Harbor]]'s streets, burying all too many things that Hu Tao could go and do each day.<br><!--
-->She'd counted, of course &mdash; and apart from assigning [[Zhongli]] to make purchases, partaking in poetic collaborations with [[Xingqiu]], and going out for meals with [[Yun Jin]], who was on a diet, there wasn't much fun to be had at all.<br><!--
-->Oh, the boredom. The boredom! It was like someone had swaddled her in blankets. Or frozen her mind in ice!<br><!--
-->Ever the enemy of ennui, tedium, and torpor, Director Hu of the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]] had to salvage this languid, lachrymose outlook somehow! And so, she met with the [[Chef Mao|great chef]] of [[Wanmin Restaurant]], and together they conferred.<br><!--
-->Two to zero, it was unanimously agreed &mdash; only delicious mutton hotpot could solve this problem!<br><!--
-->[[Xiangling]] would take charge of the cooking, and the purchase of ingredients would Hu Tao shoulder.<br><br><!--
-->In the chef's professional opinion, [[Chenyu Vale]]'s [[Fluff-Fleece Goat]]s were the ideal choice for the meat involved.<br><!--
-->And so Hu Tao tramped up and down in the winter wear Xiangling had gifted her, from [[Chihu Rock]] to [[Yujing Terrace]], until she found fresh mutton at [[Wanyou Boutique]].<br><!--
-->After some back and forth, [[Bolai]] agreed to give her a discount.<br><!--
-->How he muttered and murmured as he sliced two marbled hunks of mutton off, like one enduring great financial loss. But as he prepared to wrap them up in oil paper&mdash;<br><!--
-->"One moment," Director Hu said, raising a hand to stop him.<br><!--
-->"This living creature has given its life to satisfy human appetites. It deserves a burial."<br><!--
-->"We lack time to prepare the full rites, which is a shame &mdash; but let me speak a brief eulogy instead."<br><!--
-->Then, taking her sunglasses off and straightening her clothes, she spoke thus in solemnity:<br><!--
-->"O little goat, born you were in Chenyu Vale. From springs you drank, on grass you fed.<br><!--
-->"Surely you ran oft over the hills, for your meat is springy and firm.<br><!--
-->"Yet surely you ate and slept your fill, as the wealth of oil and fat attest.<br><!--
-->"You ate and slept well, living free of worry and regret.<br><!--
-->"Now, go well with my thanks, for kindly helping to fill my tummy."<br><!--
-->The ceremony concluded, Hu Tao wrapped the meat with care, before asking Bolai for some greens and frozen tofu.<br><!--
-->It occurred to her then, as she walked off. This was quite a bit more meat than expected... So why not call in a few extra people? That's what hot pot was all about, right?<br><!--
-->Right, then. Best get Xingqiu, [[Chongyun]], not to mention Yun Jin and [[Xinyan]].<br><!--
-->[[Qiqi]] too, should they meet along the way. And if Dr. [[Baizhu]] was interested, why, he was welcome too!<br><!--
-->Well, then. Who said that cold days were without their charm? Time to go, time to go. A happy hotpot party awaits!
