|description    = A simple rack crafted from [[Adhigama Wood]] and [[Brightwood]]. Different animal hides were sewn together before being stretched out on this tool to be dried together. This method allows hunters to make use of small hides effectively.<br>However, some say that this is not what the tool was originally designed for &mdash; one used to hang fishing nets on the rack to clear the fish they had caught of sand and mud.<br>Today, no one cares about its original purpose. The locals have a simple philosophy: Anything can be used anyway, it's all a matter of convenience!
