{{Description|This is Collei's go-to gadget for dealing with unruly wild beasts. A few good thwacks from this tool will generally improve their bahvaior. This same principle works just as well on evildoers.}}
'''Floral Brush''' is [[Collei]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|2.5}}
* The Floral Ring will fly back to the player even if the player moves away from their original position.
* The period of time in which the Floral Ring stays on-field can be greatly extended if the player can exceed the speed in which the Floral Ring returns to the player. Characters with fast movement speed (e.g., [[Sayu]]) can achieve this easily. However, only two instances of damage can be dealt even if the Floral Ring makes contact with the enemy hitbox multiple times in its duration. The Floral Ring will disappear if it fails to return to the player within 10 seconds, and will not be able to trigger her 1st Ascension Passive.

;<big>Passive Effects</big>
* {{Talent Note|character=Collei|talent=Floral Brush|ascension|1|Floral Sidewinder|If any party member triggers an [[elemental reaction]] involving {{Dendro}} before the Floral Ring returns, then it grants the Sprout effect upon return, which continuously deals {{Color|Dendro DMG}} equivalent to 40% of Collei's ATK to nearby opponents for 3s.}}
** Floral Sidewinder is also affected by Collei's {{Talent Note|constellation|2|Through Hill and Copse|If Floral Sidewinder is unlocked, then the Sprout effect becomes guaranteed on return of the Floral Ring, and triggering an elemental reaction involving {{Dendro}} before it returns now extends the duration of the Sprout effect by 3 seconds.}}

;<big>Constellation Effects</big>
* {{Talent Note|constellation|3|Scent of Summer}}
* {{Talent Note|constellation|6|Forest of Falling Arrows}}
