==Steps==
Start the quest by talking to [[Clymene]].

# Offer a [[Sango Pearl]] to the seven royal tombs (0/7)
# Go to where Clymene is
# Go to the Soul Guide's Locus
# Talk to Clymene
# Obtain the [[Divine Bridle]]
# Place the Divine Bridle within the waters
#Talk to Clymene

==Notes==
* Obtaining the Divine Bridle requires completion of the ''[[Hyperion's Dirge]]'' quest line.

==Post-Quest==
* After completing the quest, the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[Sunchildren Hide and Seek]]'' will become available. Complete this hidden objective by finding and interacting with all seven [[Sinshades]] of the [[Sunchildren]], which will grant the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "The Children of God Shall Dance."

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You help Clymene pay respects at seven royal tombs to lay the souls of the Sunchildren to rest...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to ???)
:'''???:''' Hmm? How strange. I have not seen someone in your garb for a many long years...
:'''???:''' From your mannerisms, you are not from Byakuyakoku either.
:'''???:''' Are you some guest from afar who fell into this place?
:{{DIcon}} That's more or less correct...
:'''???:''' To think that there were ways to access Byakuyakoku from the outside world... Shocking news indeed.
:'''???:''' I was born here, and I have never seen anyone from the outside world.
:'''???:''' Someone once told me that he wanted to catch a glimpse of the world outside. I took his words for a jest...
:'''???:''' *sigh*
:'''???:''' Traveler. In truth, I have a humble request for you.
:'''???:''' There are seven royal tombs scattered throughout Byakuyakoku, in which the remains of our "{{Rubi|[[Sunchildren]]|Phaethons}}" have been interred.
:'''Paimon:''' The Sunchildren...
:'''???:''' Indeed. Here, we worship the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]].
:'''???:''' After a certain number of years, an infant will be chosen as the Sunchild, gaining control over the nation.
:'''???:''' We had... a total of seven Sunchildren.
:'''???:''' O rare Traveler from another land, please, kindly pay respects at their tombs.
:'''Paimon:''' Um, why would you need us outsiders to do that?
:'''Paimon:''' Isn't it usually up to their family and friends to pay respects to them?
:'''???:''' Indeed, that would normally be the case.
:'''???:''' Unfortunately, I fear that no one in this nation would want to do so.
:'''???:''' In fact, it is likely that these royal tombs have not been visited in a long time.
:'''Paimon:''' But why's that?
:'''Paimon:''' Do the people of this nation dislike the Sunchildren?
:'''???:''' "Dislike" is perhaps too kind a word. "Detest" might be more fitting.
:'''???:''' As I said earlier, the Sunchildren were born into their role.
:'''???:''' But how could mere children rule a nation? The ones who truly controlled everything were powerful people behind the scenes.
:'''???:''' The Sunchildren were mere puppets, their every move manipulated by these people.
:'''???:''' And yet there was no end to the greed of those powerful people. They grew fat off the toil of the people, compelling the Sunchildren to perform heinous deeds.
:'''???:''' And so, the peoples' ire rose, and many of those sins were laid at the feet of the Sunchildren.
:'''Paimon:''' That's awful...
:'''Paimon:''' The Sunchildren were innocent!
:'''???:''' Innocent? Oh no, they were not.
:'''???:''' As far as the people of Byakuyakoku were concerned, their ignorance was the greatest sin of all.
:'''???:''' A sin, even committed in ignorance, can hurt others. Can a person who commits such transgressions truly be called innocent?
:'''???:''' It would be difficult, no? The damage is already done, and it cannot be undone.
:{{DIcon}} But if that's what you think...
:{{DIcon}} Why do you still want us to pay our respects to them?
:'''???:''' Well, you can consider this... my personal sentimentality speaking.
:'''Clymene:''' My name is Clymene. I was a female official in charge of taking care of the Sunchildren's daily lives within the Dainichi Mikoshi.
:'''Clymene:''' Though I knew that they did wrong, and though I was aware that they were being manipulated...
:'''Clymene:''' They were still children that I watched grow up. I pitied them, and I grieved for them...
:'''Clymene:''' In the end, I could not hate them....
:'''Clymene:''' Though my work involved being around them every day, I was under heavy surveillance.
:'''Clymene:''' I was not permitted to say a single word when I was around those children.
:'''Clymene:''' But when no one was around, when they were helpless and afraid, they would say so, so many things to me...
:'''Clymene:''' ...And I could not offer them a single word in reply.
:'''Clymene:''' If I had possessed but a little self-sacrificial courage to say something, anything to them...
:'''Clymene:''' Perhaps everything might have gone differently...
:'''Clymene:''' So please, I beg you. I cannot face them as I am, so this is the only way I can honor them.
:'''Clymene:''' Please, good Traveler, lend me your aid just this once.
:'''Clymene:''' A single Sango Pearl is all I ask, to be laid before their tombs.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:'''Clymene:''' Thank you. This task is in your hands, then.

;(Talk to Clymene again)
:'''Clyemene:''' There were seven Sunchildren in all. Traveler, please take my place and pay respects before their tombs.

{{Anchor|Royal Tomb}}

:'''Royal Tomb:''' The second row is in the common script, and it goes as follows:
:'''Royal Tomb:''' "Here lies [[Orupeusu]] no Mikoto, who was skilled in music as a youth, specializing in playing the lyre. His voice was so lovely that even the very earth would be moved."

;(Tombstone - North of Evernight Temple)
:'''Royal Tomb:''' There are two rows of text on this headstone. The first row is in the script of Byakuyakoku and is unintelligible.
:'''Royal Tomb:''' The second row is in the common script, and it goes as follows:

;(Tombstone - South of Evernight Temple)

:'''Royal Tomb:''' The second row is in the common script, and it goes as follows:

:'''Royal Tomb:''' The second row is in the common script, and it goes as follows:

:'''Royal Tomb:''' "Here lies [[Piramumon]] no Mikoto. Oft did he insist that there must be a world beyond our skies, but they were just wild claims."

----
;(After offering the Sango Pearl at all 7 tombstones)
:'''Paimon:''' One, two, three... Looks like we've finished paying respects at all seven tombs!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go back to the stone shrine and tell the spirit there about this.

;(Talk to Clymene)
:'''Clymene:''' Ah, the seven Soul Lamps are lit...
:'''Clymene:''' It seems that you have completed your task. I will always remember how you have aided me.
:'''Clymene:''' Now come, allow me to open it for you... The path to the Soul Guide's Locus.
:'''Clymene:''' Traveler from a foreign land, I know that I have caused you much trouble... But please, bear witness as they are laid to rest.
:'''Clymene:''' Follow this path. I will meet you on its far side.

;(Approach the Soul Guide's Locus)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon didn't think we could get up here at all!

;(Talk to Clymene)
:'''Clymene:''' Ah, Traveler, you have arrived.
:'''Clymene:''' This is the Soul Guide's Locus, and this is where my final thoughts remain.
:'''Clymene:''' When the Sunchildren reached a certain age, they would follow a ceremony and enter the Dainichi Mikoshi on their birth date.
:{{DIcon}} They would enter it?
::'''Clymene:''' Yes, and that process was known as the Rite of Solar Return.
::'''Clymene:''' The Sunchildren were birthed from the Dainichi Mikoshi, and they would again return to the seat of the sun before the mortal world could taint them.
::'''Clymene:''' ...The temperature of the Dainichi Mikoshi was such that its light could warm all of Byakuyakoku.
::'''Clymene:''' Of the Sunchildren, naught but shreds of the souls that once were returned at last to the Locus.
::'''Clymene:''' But I still believe that, perhaps...
::{{DIcon}} Perhaps...?
::'''Clymene:''' If I was the one who opened the Locus, I might be able to use my memories to supplement what remains of their souls.
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't that mean...
:'''Clymene:''' Allow me to try.
:'''Clymene:''' Piramumon... Orupeusu... I am here. Will you not return?
:'''Clymene:''' ...
:'''(Traveler):''' How did it go?
:'''Clymene:''' *sigh* Of the seven Sunchildren, Piramumon and Orupeusu were raised by mine own hand. If even they will not return...
:'''Clymene:''' It seems that my memories alone are insufficient...
:'''Clymene:''' If only there was something I could use as a medium... If I had the Divine Bridle, perhaps, the badge of the Sunchild's office, it might just work.
:'''Clymene:''' But alas! It was lost to us long ago.
:'''Clymene:''' *sigh* This nation, Byakuyakoku, still hates those children.
:'''Clymene:''' Perhaps my desire to free their souls is but a forlorn hope.
:'''Clymene:''' ...But still, Traveler, if you would consider this my final request — could you help to find the Divine Bridle?
:'''Clymene:''' I know that the chances of finding it are quite slim, and indeed, it is rude of me to ask yet more of you.
:'''Clymene:''' But...
:{{DIcon}} I understand.
:{{DIcon}} I'll do my best.
:'''Clymene:''' I... Thank you...
:'''Clymene:''' Still, the bridle has been lost for many long years. You need not rush.
:'''Clymene:''' If you should hear of it, please, tell me.

----
;(Talk to Clymene)
:'''Clymene:''' Traveler... Have you... found the bridle?
:'''Clymene:''' Could you... let me have a look at it?
;(After submitting the bridle)
:'''Clymene:''' Ahhh... This is the Divine Bridle. The genuine article indeed!
:'''Clymene:''' I never thought that the day would come when I might lay eyes on it once more. Traveler, tell me — whence did you get this?
:{{DIcon}} From Aberaku...
:'''Clymene:''' From Aberaku no Mikoto himself?
:'''Clymene:''' How strange. I remember clearly that he was a great figure from the days when our nation had just been founded.
:'''Clymene:''' But it was said that he planned to usurp the seat of the Sunchild, and was branded with the crime of treason.
:'''Clymene:''' But since you say that you obtained it from his hands, perhaps there are hidden things at work that I do not understand.
:'''Clymene:''' So, fate has decreed the bridle should resurface here... Ah, I can recall the faces of those children already...
:'''Clymene:''' This way, I might finally atone for my failings...
:'''Clymene:''' Traveler, place the bridle within the pool at the Locus. With it, we can surely revivify their souls.
:'''Clymene:''' Yes, that they may be made whole, and that they may walk the path to the next life hale!

;(Talk to Clymene after putting the stone in water)
:'''Clymene:''' Ah, Piramumon. You did so love books, saying that there must be a world outside our knowledge, though I did not believe you then...
:'''Clymene:''' I always smiled and shook my head at your wild pronouncements. Alas, alas! I should have believed you!
:'''Clymene:''' You said that one day you would escape the Dainichi Mikoshi and venture into paths beyond...
:'''Clymene:''' Go now, Piramumon. Let no one shackle you again. Go, be free!
:'''Clymene:''' And you, Orupeusu, Orupeusu. What would I give to hear you sing again?
:'''Clymene:''' There was no one who could hear your clear, pure voice, and did not wish to sing along in their hearts.
:'''Clymene:''' The night before the Rite of Solar Return, you suddenly wished to hear my voice. No matter what, you desired to hear me sing.
:'''Clymene:''' You told me that no matter how terribly I sang, you would not laugh.
:'''Clymene:''' You knew, didn't you? You knew that this Solar Return would be your last.
:'''Clymene:''' And yet I... To the end, I...
:{{DIcon}} Clymene?
:'''Clymene:''' ...I apologize, Traveler. That was unsightly of me.
:'''Clymene:''' The female official who serves the Sunchildren is meant to maintain her purity... She shall never marry.
:'''Clymene:''' Thus, I had no children of my own all my life.
:'''Clymene:''' These children, whom I served and watched grow older... At some point, they became closer to me than blood.
:'''Clymene:''' Thank you, Traveler. Thank you for finding the bridle.
:'''Clymene:''' It has passed through the hands of every Sunchild, and the memories it has inherited are enough to fill the gaps in their souls.
:'''Clymene:''' ...Even though these memories are double-sided.
:{{DIcon}} Double-sided?
:{{DIcon}} Memories have sides?
:'''Clymene:''' Of course. In this case, the memories are two-fold. On one hand, you have your own memories, and on the other, you have others' memories of you.
:'''Clymene:''' Thus the gaps are being filled by both the Sunchildren's own memories, imprinted upon the bridle...
:'''Clymene:''' As well as the memories of them as the children who were blamed by Byakuyakoku, of those who became children of sin.
:'''Clymene:''' My own memories are insufficient, and so I had to supplement them with those of the people of our nation.
:'''Clymene:''' And it is thanks to these transgressions that have been laid upon them that they have now been remembered by Byakuyakoku, and can now leave their afterimages behind.
:'''Clymene:''' Thank you, Traveler. My greatest wish now lies fulfilled.
:'''Clymene:''' Yes, I... can finally be with those children again...
:'''Clymene:''' I can finally... be at ease.

==Trivia==
* In Greek mythology, {{w|Phaethon}} was the son of Helios, god of the sun, while {{w|syrtos}} was a traditional Greek dance in which the dancers linked hands to form a chain. Thus "The Phaethons' Syrtos" can be interpreted as "the dance of the children of the sun god," connecting with the name of the [[Achievement]] gained from completing the Hidden Exploration Objective after this quest, "[[The Children of God Shall Dance]]."
