* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 4.2, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:
** Phase I: Tidal Moon
*** When a character's HP increases or decreases, it will be counted. When it reaches a total of 12, a shockwave will be unleashed at the character's position, dealing True DMG to nearby opponents and clearing the count. 1 such shockwave can be unleashed every 4s.
** Phase II: Uncanny Moon
*** When off-field characters deal Elemental Skill DMG to an opponent, an Uncanny Mark will be placed upon that opponent. When another active character hits a marked opponent with an attack of the same Elemental Type, a shockwave will be unleashed at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. The Uncanny Mark lasts 5s, and Marks created through different attacks with different Elemental Types can exist independently. 1 such shockwave can be unleashed every 2s. When a character enters the field, the Uncanny Marks placed by that character on opponents will be removed.

A character with 3 stacks will unleash a shockwave at an opponent's position when they deal DMG to that opponent, dealing True DMG. This effect will be cleared when the character leaves the field. 1 such shockwave can be unleashed every 1s.
