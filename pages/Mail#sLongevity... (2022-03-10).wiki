In the past, my [[Cloud Retainer|master]] knew that I didn't need material possessions, so she would only send me a blessing on this day. Thus, I've only recently learned of the custom of eating longevity noodles on one's birthday.

However, longevity in of itself is not something I want to pursue. Rather, I would like to spend that longevity with the people I have formed a bond with.

I asked my master who excels in cooking for advice on how to prepare it well, but she wanted me to figure it out by myself.

I don't know how much I've figured out. I guess that will be for you to judge.

I'll be waiting.
