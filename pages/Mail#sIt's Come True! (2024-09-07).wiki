|text      = Another birthday has arrived. Could it be that the wish I made in past years — to "see evil spirits soon" &mdash; was fulfilled in last night's dream? As soon as I woke up, I hurriedly sketched what I had seen in said dream, but the details faded even as I drew. In the end, I captured nothing more than a few faint hints of a "long tail" and "finned back"...

I took the drawing around, asking anyone who might know, and finally learned from [[Xingqiu]] that such evil spirits originate from [[Natlan]], and can only be fully vanquished in hot springs or magma. Quite a tricky business indeed...

I've heard, dear friend, that you're traveling in Natlan. If you encounter these spirits, please take pictures of them, so that we can discuss them in detail when we meet again. A fierce battle seems inevitable, so I'm sending you some local delicacies from here to boost your spirits!
