==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Alhaitham wears a dark half-off coat-like garment with a green front and lapels. The coat's color fades from dark green to black and has numerous golden details and numerous trinkets, as well as a black mini cape with a golden underside. The "sleeve" of this garment that he wears is his left sleeve, leaving his right arm exposed. He sports a tight black top with a split high collar and detached sleeves, also decorated with golden details and a green ornament on his chest. His arm sleeves partially cover his hands, leaving certain fingers exposed. These are held together with numerous gold-patterned green fabrics around his waist from which a number of trinkets dangle including two light blue leaf-shaped charms, and three teardrop-like trinkets. He wears tight dark green pants and black and gold knee-high boots with a colorful top. His {{Dendro}} [[Vision]] is attached to his coat on his left shoulder.
