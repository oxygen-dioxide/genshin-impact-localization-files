|description  = A very commonly-seen bait made from mashing, fermenting, and kneading Sunsettias and Wheat together. It atomizes very quickly upon hitting the water and exerts an incredible attraction on small fish. Due to the ease of its making, cheap price, and its excellent efficacy, it has also been jokingly called the "Fisher's Trusty Treasure".<br />Suitable for catching [[Medaka]]s, [[Dawncatcher]]s, and [[Crystalfish]].
