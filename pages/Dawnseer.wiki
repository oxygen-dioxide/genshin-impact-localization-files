|description  = Citlali's outfit. Shamans are seers, diviners of forgotten past and untold future. In their world, the eye holds a special symbolic meaning. This is why Citlali's robe, worn half-draped around her waist, is adorned with the "Eye of Revelation" &mdash; a pattern that encapsulates both its bearer's identity and her aesthetic tastes.

Two strands of her hair is tied into braids with black gold-edged rings at the end. Her head with two black circles attached to purple and pink feather .

Citlali wears a sleeveless black bodysuit with a small diamond chest cutouts and back cutouts, a dark blue, purple and pink fabric that acts as a miniskirt, held in place to her hip by an indigo and pink ribbon on which her {{Cryo}} [[Vision]] sits. And a black, cyan, and pink neck decoration and black fingerless gloves of two different lengths: her left glove goes from her upper arm to her hand. In contrast, her right glove only covers her hand. Citlali sports a large number of golden bracelets and black gladiator sandals. Her face, arms, and legs are painted with pastel purple triangles. She additionally has purple nail polish fading black adorning her fingers and toes.
