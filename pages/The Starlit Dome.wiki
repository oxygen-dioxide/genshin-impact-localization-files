==Trivia==
* The Chinese title 山瞑星河稀 can be translated as "The mountains are dusky, the river of stars (Milky Way) is scarce." 山瞑 may be a reference to the first four lines of the poem ''宿桐庐江寄广陵旧游'' by Tang Dynasty poet {{w|Meng Haoran}} (孟浩然).<ref>exam58.com: [http://www.exam58.com/tsmj/3975.html “山暝听猿愁，沧江急夜流。”--孟浩然《宿桐庐江寄广陵旧游》翻]</ref> The poem speaks of the loneliness of being away from one's homeland, and so it may be a reference to the Millelith soldiers who fought and died or were trapped in The Chasm.<br /><br />山瞑听猿愁，沧江急夜流 。 ''Within the dusky mountains can be heard the sorrow of monkeys, the rushing river flows in the night.''<br />风鸣两岸叶，月照一孤舟。 ''The wind blows the leaves of both shores, the moon shines upon a lone boat.''<br />建德非吾土，维扬忆旧游。 ''Jiande is not my home, I remember my old journeys in Yangzhou.''<br />还将两行泪，遥寄海西头。 ''Allow me these two rows of tears, distantly sent to the western sea.''
