==Trivia==
* {{Transclude|On a Cold Night|ChasmSurfaceTheme3|section=1}}
* The Chinese title {{zh|山瞑星河稀}} can be translated as "The mountains are dusky, the river of stars (Milky Way) is scarce." {{zh|山瞑}} may be a reference to the first four lines of the poem [http://www.exam58.com/tsmj/3975.html {{zh|宿桐庐江寄广陵旧游}}] by Tang Dynasty poet {{w|Meng Haoran}} ({{zh|孟浩然}}). The poem speaks of the loneliness of being away from one's homeland, and so it may be a reference to the Millelith soldiers who fought and died or were trapped in The Chasm.
*:{{zh|山瞑听猿愁，沧江急夜流 。|tl=Within the dusky mountains can be heard the sorrow of monkeys, the rushing river flows in the night.}}
*:{{zh|风鸣两岸叶，月照一孤舟。|tl=The wind blows the leaves of both shores, the moon shines upon a lone boat.}}
*:{{zh|建德非吾土，维扬忆旧游。|tl=Jiande is not my home, I remember my old journeys in Yangzhou.}}
*:{{zh|还将两行泪，遥寄海西头。|tl=Allow me these two rows of tears, distantly sent to the western sea.}}
