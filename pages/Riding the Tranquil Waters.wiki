|description    = A towering mask that can be found for sale at stalls in the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]'s [[Chuwen Fair]]. Its unique shape and blue patterns are said to be inspired by waterborne boats, providing a distinct sense of tranquility. Consequently, beyond its decorative use, some vacationers and those suffering from insomnia wear this mask in the hope of benefiting from its "calming" effects.
