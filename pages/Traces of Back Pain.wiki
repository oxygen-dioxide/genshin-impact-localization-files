{{Quest Description|It seems that Chalmet is having some trouble organizing files...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Chalmet)
:'''Chalmet:''' Ow... Why is that box so heavy...
:{{DIcon}} Are you okay?
:'''Chalmet:''' We meet again, Honorary Senior Researcher. I apologize... My... my lower back seems to have been injured, it hurts so badly...
:'''Chalmet:''' I was planning to move a box over here and organize the materials inside.
:'''Chalmet:''' I... I never imagined the box would be so heavy, and I couldn't quite keep my footing when I lifted it, so all the strain went straight to my waist...
:'''Chalmet:''' Now I... It feels like my waist is broken, ow...
:{{DIcon}} Need me to carry you to a doctor?
:{{DIcon}} I can call someone for you.
:'''Chalmet:''' No, no need... I've hurt my lower back before, I just need to rest a bit...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders just how many files are inside, for it to be this heavy...
:'''Chalmet:''' There must be... Well, a ton of files. After all, the Institute once promoted a style of work called "Document Everything" for some time.
:'''Chalmet:''' Basically, it meant that absolutely a single thing at the Institute had to be physically documented.
:'''Chalmet:''' After they began promoting this policy, the Institute's paper usage increased 5 times...
:'''Chalmet:''' And because there were so many documents, every single office was forced to create a "document management" post just to categorize and sort all the documentation...
:'''Paimon:''' So everything had to be written down? That sounds really annoying...
:'''Chalmet:''' It was! Later, that style was slowly phased out, and only implemented to a limited extent.
:'''Chalmet:''' But let's not discuss that now... Honorary Senior Researcher, can you help me handle the file box? Though my waist hurts, I still need to organize the files inside...
:{{DIcon}} Sure...
:{{DIcon}} You just recuperate.
::'''Chalmet:''' No need to worry, I only need my hands to organize documents, I won't hurt my lower back further.
;(If version A)
::'''Chalmet:''' Could I trouble you to bring me the file box on the {{color|buzzword|table to the left}} just inside the door?
::'''Chalmet:''' Thank you! It's really heavy, so be careful, and don't injure yourself... like me...
;(If version B)
::'''Chalmet:''' Could I trouble you to bring me the file box on the {{color|buzzword|table to the right}} just inside the door?
::'''Chalmet:''' Thank you! It's really heavy, so be careful, don't injure yourself... like me...
----
;(Talk to Chalmet again)
:'''Chalmet:''' Well? Did you get me that box?
:;(Opens submission menu)

;(If the player retrieved and submitted only the correct box)
::'''Chalmet:''' Excellent! This is the one, thank you so much! You've been such a big help.
::'''Chalmet:''' Please take these. And once I... Ow! Once I'm... a bit better, I can keep working...
::'''Chalmet:''' *sigh* When will the Institute finally assign me an assistant...
;(If the player retrieved and submitted only the incorrect box)
::'''Chalmet:''' Huh? I think you got the wrong box, but... it's fine, there's plenty of files in this one that need organizing too.
::'''Chalmet:''' Please take these. And once I... Ow! Once I'm... a bit better, I can keep working...
::'''Chalmet:''' *sigh* When will the Institute finally assign me an assistant...
;(If player retrieved both boxes and submits either)
::'''Chalmet:''' You... Why did you bring both boxes of files over?
::{{DIcon}} I forgot which one it was!
:::'''Chalmet:''' Pffft... I guess that's just how you roll. Thanks! Both boxes have files I need to organize, anyway.
::{{DIcon}} I thought you would need them both.
:::'''Chalmet:''' Your instincts are accurate as ever. Both boxes do indeed contain files I need to organize.
::'''Chalmet:''' Since you've brought them both over, I should get going now. This is going to be a huge task!
::'''Chalmet:''' Please, take these, and thank you again for your help, Honorary Senior Researcher.
::'''Chalmet:''' *sigh* When will the Institute finally assign me an assistant...
