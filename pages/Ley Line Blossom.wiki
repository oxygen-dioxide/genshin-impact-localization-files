{{Description|Brilliant flower buds that sprout from elements seeping out from Ley Lines, using someone's will as its fertile soil in which to grow. Touch it to receive its extravagant treasures.}}
'''Ley Line Blossoms''' spawn after completing [[Ley Line Outcrops]] and defeating [[Bosses]].

All Ley Lines cost various amounts of [[Original Resin]] to claim their rewards.

==Blossoms of Revelation & Wealth==
{{Main|Ley Line Outcrops}}
These are spawned by completing Ley Line Outcrops.

They will provide [[Adventure EXP]] and either [[Character EXP Materials]] (Blossom of Revelation) or [[Mora]] (Blossom of Wealth).

In each [[region]], only one of each type of Ley Line Blossom can spawn at a time.

==Trounce Blossom==
{{Main|Bosses}}
{{Quote|Trounce Blossoms are Ley Line Blossoms that symbolize mighty beings. The flowers that bloom from these livings {{sic}} souls of extraordinary power usually require 60 Original Resin to revitalize and thus obtain their treasure from the ley lines.<br><br>
Three opportunities shall arise every week to halve the cost of revitalizing Trounce Blossoms.<br><br>These rewards and the opportunities to halve the cost of claiming them will refresh every Monday at 4{{colon}}00 AM.|Official description for Trounce Ley Line Blossoms}}

Trounce Blossoms are Ley Line Blossoms that spawn after defeating [[Normal Bosses]] like the [[Electro Hypostasis]] and [[Weekly Bosses]] like [[Wolf of the North Challenge]].

The rewards will be based on which boss was defeated and their level.
