===Initial Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Anna or Anthony)
:'''Anna:''' Traveler, come have a look! What do you think? Does this look good on me?
:{{DIcon}} Oh, this uniform...!
:'''Anna:''' That's right! I passed the [[Adventurers' Guild]] exam. That makes me an officially-recognized adventurer!
:{{DIcon}} You look awesome!
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations!
:'''Anna:''' Hehe, thanks. I tried to persuade my brother to give the exam a go too, but he refused no matter what I said...
:'''Anthony:''' I've got no interest in adventures... And anyway, who'll take care of our parents if we both become adventurers?
:'''Anna:''' Well, then we can bring them along! We can travel the whole world together!
:'''Anthony:''' You... Alright, alright. You're an adventurer now, so do your best. Leave matters at home to me.
:'''Anthony:''' But remember, don't get yourself injured, and don't overtax yourself...
:'''Anna:''' Oh, fine, fine, I get it! Heading out now, I've got a commission to finish!
:'''Anna:''' Traveler, do you mind coming with me? I've got so many things I want to ask you about being an adventurer!
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:{{DIcon}} Okay. Let's go!
:'''Anna:''' Now let me see. This commission is...
:'''Anna:''' Transport Balloon Escort!

;(Talk to Anthony again, optional)
:'''Anthony:''' Please take care of Anna, Traveler. Her excitement might have gotten to her head lately...
:{{DIcon}} Do you not want her to become an adventurer?
:'''Anthony:''' ...
:'''Anthony:''' I respect my sister's wishes.
:'''Anthony:''' Now that she's well again after such a long struggle with her illness, she deserves a chance to pursue her dreams.
:'''Anthony:''' As her brother, I'll support her... all the way.
:'''Anthony:''' That's all I have to say.

----
;(Approach the Transport Balloon)
:'''Anna:''' Huh, so this is the transport balloon we're escorting. It's packed to capacity with so much stuff!
:'''Anna:''' Now we're supposed to activate it... like this?

;(After selecting "Start")
:'''Anna:''' Alright, here we go! Let's follow it.
:'''Anna:''' Traveler, do you ever have trouble keeping up with the balloon you're supposed to be escorting?
:'''Paimon:''' We usually stay in front of the balloon to clear obstacles or monsters outta the way.
:'''Anna:''' I see, I see... I'll note that down.
:'''Anna:''' This balloon's following a really strange path. How are we supposed to guard it like this?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, if escort commissions were that easy, they wouldn't have to be commissioned in the first place.
:'''Anna:''' Ah. So that's how it is...
:'''Anna:''' Our destination is right up ahead. Let's put in a little extra effort, shall we?
:'''Paimon:''' Anna's really getting into this...

;(After destroying the wooden barrier)
:'''Anna:''' And we're done! Thanks, Traveler. This went pretty well, I think.
:'''Anna:''' But is this the usual fare for adventurers?
:{{DIcon}} There will be others.
::'''Paimon:''' What's with that hapless tone...
:{{DIcon}} You'll understand in time...
::'''Anna:''' Hey, not that tired look...
:'''Anna:''' Is that so... Nice! I'll keep working at it, then!
:'''Anna:''' Once I've saved up enough Mora, I'll bring my brother and our parents out on a trip!
:'''Anna:''' My brother always wanted to travel... But I fell ill, and he had to stay back to take care of me.
:'''Anna:''' But I'm well now, and I've even become an adventurer.
:'''Anna:''' Hehe. When the time comes, I'll help my brother fulfill some of his dreams too!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Subsequent Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Anna:''' Alright. Let's work hard today, too!
:{{DIcon}} Haha, you're all fired up.
::'''Anna:''' Of course! Being an adventurer is really interesting!
::'''Anna:''' Well... I still am a bit unfamiliar with what to do while undertaking commissions, though.
::'''Anna:''' Traveler, would you mind coming with me again? I still have things I'd like to ask you.
:{{DIcon}} Want me to come along?
::'''Anna:''' Would you? Hehe, sure! There's still so much I could learn from you.
:'''Anna:''' Then let's set out. Today's commission is...
:'''Anna:''' Huh... So we're escorting... another transport balloon.

;(Talk to Anthony, optional)
:'''Anthony:''' Please take care of Anna, Traveler. Her excitement might have gotten to her head lately...
:{{DIcon}} Do you not want her to become an adventurer?
:'''Anthony:''' ...
:'''Anthony:''' I respect my sister's wishes.
:'''Anthony:''' Now that she's well again after such a long struggle with her illness, she deserves a chance to pursue her dreams.
:'''Anthony:''' As her brother, I'll support her... all the way.
:'''Anthony:''' That's all I have to say.

;(After reaching the location)
:'''Anna:''' Huh, so this is the transport balloon we're escorting. It's packed to capacity with so much stuff!
:'''Anna:''' Now we're supposed to activate it... like this?

;(After pressing start)
:'''Anna:''' Alright, here we go! Let's follow it.
:'''Anna:''' Traveler, do you ever have trouble keeping up with the balloon you're supposed to be escorting?
:'''Paimon:''' We usually stay in front of the balloon to clear obstacles or monsters outta the way.
:'''Anna:''' I see, I see... I'll note that down.
:'''Anna:''' This balloon's following a really strange path. How are we supposed to guard it like this?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, if escort commissions were that easy, they wouldn't have to be commissioned in the first place.
:'''Anna:''' Ah. So that's how it is...

====Treasure Hoarders Ending====
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''???:''' By royal decree!
:'''Treasure Hoarder:''' Uh, Boss? What on earth is she saying?
:'''Treasure Hoarder:''' I, ah, didn't get it either...? Whatever the case, let's split!

;(Upon encountering the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Anna:''' Yikes! Where did these Treasure Hoarders pop out from?
:'''Anna:''' T&mdash;Traveler! Guess it's you and me together, then!

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Bennett:''' Fischl. You ran off too quickly! That was really risky...
:'''Fischl:''' Hah! Mine thundering retribution spares not any evildoers...
:'''Anna:''' Oh, it's Fischl and Bennett! Hello there!
:'''Bennett:''' Oh, it's you, Anna. And the Traveler, too! Are you on a commission?
:'''Fischl:''' Ah, you have arrived, O you who art blessed by the Prinzessin! Surely were you led here by the weft of fate.
:'''Oz:''' Mein Fr√§ulein wishes to say that she is pleased to have met you by chance.
:{{DIcon}} I'm accompanying Anna on her commission.
:'''Anna:''' That's right. The Traveler and I were just escorting this transport balloon.
:'''Anna:''' But all of a sudden, a whole bunch of Treasure Hoarders came charging at us...
:'''Bennett:''' Uh, I'm terribly sorry about that. That was my fault.
:'''Bennett:''' Fischl and I accepted a commission to investigate the whereabouts of a certain band of Treasure Hoarders.
:'''Bennett:''' Oz managed to catch their trail, and we were about to capture them... And then I tripped over a branch and fell over.
:'''Bennett:''' The noise startled those Treasure Hoarders, who turned and fled. We had no choice but to keep chasing them...
:'''Fischl:''' There was never any reason to fret. The violet light of conviction was ever fated to sever the destinies of those foul rogues.
:'''Oz:''' But Mein Fr√§ulein, was it not the Traveler who ultimately apprehended them?
:'''Fischl:''' O&mdash;Oz!
:'''Bennett:''' W&mdash;Well, anyway, thanks for your help this time. It really was fortunate that you were there to bar their path.
:'''Bennett:''' Looks like my luck's pretty good today, huh!
:{{DIcon}} Glad I could help.
:'''Bennett:''' Hehe. Well then, guess we'll haul these Treasure Hoarders back to the Guild. Be careful now &mdash; and don't forget to watch your step.

:'''Anna:''' Bennett's as reliable as ever, I see.
:'''Anna:''' And Fischl... Her words are as impressive as ever!
:{{DIcon}} What's your impression of Bennett so far?
::'''Anna:''' My impression of him?
::'''Anna:''' When I first joined the Guild, he answered a lot of my questions and gave me lots of assistance.
::'''Anna:''' But I've heard that he has especially bad luck.
::'''Anna:''' That's just not fair. He's such a nice person...
:{{DIcon}} How's Fischl been?
::'''Anna:''' Fischl? Well, um...
::'''Anna:''' Sh&mdash;She's really awesome as well! Her archery is great, and she's cleared lots of commissions.
::'''Anna:''' I don't really understand the things that she says...
::'''Anna:''' But she's still a very experienced adventurer. W&mdash;Wait, no, she's an investigator!
:'''Anna:''' Well, guess we've finished this commission either way. Thank you, Traveler. I'm going to report back to the Guild now.
:'''Anna:''' Still, why did I get transport balloon escort a few days in a row? Doesn't the Guild have any other commissions?
