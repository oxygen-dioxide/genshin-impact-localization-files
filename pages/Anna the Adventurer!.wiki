{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Anna:''' Alright. Let's work hard today, too!
:{{DIcon}} Haha, you're all fired up.
::'''Anna:''' Of course! Being an adventurer is really interesting!
::'''Anna:''' Well... I still am a bit unfamiliar with what to do while undertaking commissions, though.
::'''Anna:''' Traveler, would you mind coming with me again? I still have things I'd like to ask you.
::'''Anna:''' Then let's set out. Today's commission is...
::'''Anna:''' Huh... So we're escorting... another transport balloon.
:{{DIcon}} Want me to come along?
::'''Anna:''' Would you? Hehe, sure! There's still so much I could learn from you.
::'''Anna:''' Then let's set out. Today's commission is...
::'''Anna:''' Huh... So we're escorting... another transport balloon.
:'''Anthony:''' Please take care of Anna, Traveler. Her excitement might have gotten to her head lately...
:{{DIcon}} Do you not want her to become an adventurer?
:'''Anthony:''' ...
:'''Anthony:''' I respect my sister's wishes.
:'''Anthony:''' Now that she's well again after such a long struggle with her illness, she deserves a chance to pursue her dreams
:'''Anthony:''' As her brother, I'll support her... all the way.
:'''Anthony:''' That's all I have to say.
;(After completing the commission)
::'''Anna:''' And we're done! Thanks, Traveler. This went pretty well, I think.
::'''Anna:''' But is this the usual fare for adventurers?
:{{DIcon}} There will be others.
::'''Anna:''' What's with that hapless tone...
::'''Anna:''' Is that so... Nice! I'll keep working at it, then!
::'''Anna:''' Once I've saved up enough Mora, I'll bring my brother and our parents out on a trip!
::'''Anna:''' My brother always wanted to travel... But I fell ill, and he had to stay back to take care of me.
::'''Anna:''' But I'm well now, and I've even become an adventurer.
::'''Anna:''' Hehe. When the time comes, I'll help my brother fulfill some of his dreams too!
:{{DIcon}} You'll understand in time...
::'''Anna:''' Hey, stop giving me that tired look...
::'''Anna:''' Is that so... Nice! I'll keep working at it, then!
::'''Anna:''' Once I've saved up enough Mora, I'll bring my brother and our parents out on a trip!
::'''Anna:''' My brother always wanted to travel... But I fell ill, and he had to stay back to take care of me.
