==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Mallko and Vichama were childhood friends who promised each other that they would fight together to the very end. However, five years ago, an injury Vichama sustained led him to be taken off the Night Warden Wars team that he was in with Mallko. Mallko and the rest of the team faced far more enemies than expected during the Night Warden War, and they made a fatal miscalculation that led the entire team to perish.

Vichama deeply regretted this turn of events all the way to the present, and the slim chance of resurrecting Mallko during the Natlan Archon Quests motivates him to help [[Kachina]]'s rescue team find their [[Ancient Name]]s. While Mallko's {{Ancient Name|bearer=1}} Ancient Name was impossible to recover due to the amount of time that had passed, the attempt temporarily reassembles parts of Mallko's soul in the [[Night Kingdom]]. Making good of the time that he has, he assists the rescue team as repayment for helping Vichama.

==Story==
===History===
Mallko's parents died when he was young.<ref name="Into Eternal Night">{{Ref/Quest|Into Eternal Night}}</ref> He grew up together with Vichama, and the two made a name for themselves by combining Mallko's strength with Vichama's talents for scouting and assessing the battlefield. At some point, they promised each other that even if they never vanquished the [[Abyss]] in their lifetimes, they would at least fight together until the very end. They were also friends with [[Atea]] and were among her "hot spring buddies."<ref name="Ancient Name">{{Ref/Quest|To Reclaim an Ancient Name}}</ref>

Five years ago, Mallko, Vichama, and another fellow tribesman named [[Pisac]] were among those who won the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]] and were selected to participate in the Night Warden Wars. However, on the eve before their departure, the Abyss attacked the Scions of the Canopy and Vichama was injured while rescuing someone. The team agreed that Vichama was unfit for battle as a result, and [[Mavuika]] agreed to allow him to stay behind. Unfortunately, the rest of the group ended up facing more enemies than anyone expected. They had a lapse of judgement which led them to be overwhelmed,<ref name="Ancient Name" /> and as they awaited their inevitable doom, Mallko and Pisac shared a few last words with each other. Pisac died before the [[Riftwolves]] reached them, while Mallko was slain by the monsters.<ref name="Into Eternal Night" />

Because nobody from the team returned alive, the [[Ode of Resurrection]] could not be used. Vichama believed his presence could have prevented them from making their fatal miscalculation and blamed himself for Mallko's death, deeply regretting his inability to make good on their promise to fight together to the very end. Mallko's soul eventually corroded in the Night Kingdom, and his [[Ancient Name]] was lost.<ref name="Ancient Name" />

===Present Day===
During the Natlan Archon Quests, Vichama is approached by Kachina's rescue team to help them use the Spiritspeaker Stone and find her lost Ancient Name. Realizing that he has a chance &mdash; however slim &mdash; to make up for his past failures by retrieving Mallko's Ancient Name, he agrees. He succeeds in finding Kachina's name, but Mallko's was lost with the passage of time. Nevertheless, his efforts are not entirely in vain, as the group is able to witness Mallko's last moments.<ref name="Ancient Name" />

The act of trying to piece Mallko's Ancient Name back together later turns out to have temporarily reassembled portions of Mallko's soul and reawakened his consciousness, which Mallko describes as feeling "like [his and Vichama's] souls were connected." Mallko approaches Kachina's rescue team and guides them to her, protecting them from the Abyssal manifestations infesting the Night Kingdom and explaining the situation with the [[Wayob]]s. His last act is to stay behind and stall the [[Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames|Abyss Lector]] Comonqui while the others go to purify the [[Children of Echoes]]' Wayob. However, given that Mallko's form is only temporary, Comonqui easily disperses his soul off-screen and catches up to the party.<ref name="Into Eternal Night" />

Mallko's soul is revitalized when the Night Kingdom regains strength after the Abyss invasion of Natlan is repelled. He and Vichama later assist the Traveler in battle in the Night Kingdom.

===Legacy===
After returning from the Night Kingdom, the [[Traveler]] can inform Vichama about their encounter with Mallko. Hearing about Mallko's actions and final sacrifice brings Vichama peace of mind, and he promises Mallko that they will be reunited one day.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Vichama}}</ref> That day ends up coming sooner rather than later, as Vichama perishes during the Abyss' invasion of Natlan during ''[[The Rainbow Destined to Burn]]''.<ref>Interactable: [[Record Penned by All]]</ref>
