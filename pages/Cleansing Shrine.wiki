|description    = A shrine in the style of the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]], made using [[Yumemiru Wood]]. It is much taller and more solemn than your average shrine. Just standing next to it, you can feel the errant thoughts in your heart start to fade away.<br />Of Course, the weight of a shrine in the peoples' hearts has nothing to do with size. This type of shrine is far older than the ones that can be seen in [[Inazuma City]] today. It is said that the latter type, which is simpler to make, was created as the [[Shogunate]]'s response to the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s order to rationalize material usage, but this narrative has never been sanctioned or endorsed by the authorities.
