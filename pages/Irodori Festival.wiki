{{Lang|'''Irodori Festival'''|ja=容彩祭|ja_rm=Sugata no Irodori Sai}} is a festival in [[Inazuma]] that celebrates the works done by [[The Five Kasen]].

==History==
The Irodori Festival originated from the legend of [[The Five Kasen]] who were gifted singers and poetry writers of ancient Inazuma.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Festive Elegance}}</ref> The Five Kasen brought a cultural revolution to the nation. As a sign of the people's appreciation towards the works of the The Five Kasen, the Irodori Festival was developed.

However, the tales of the Five Kasen were gradually forgotten and the related Iridori Festival also faded from Inazuma's customs over time.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Festive Elegance}}</ref> After the abolition of the [[Sakoku Decree]], [[Yae Miko]] decided to revive the festival by holding an international cultural convention featuring light novels, which she considers a representation of the modern Inazuman culture, as opposed to how poems represented ancient Inazuman culture.

During this renewed version of the festival, the small plaza in front of the [[International Trade Association]] was called "The Five Kasen Plaza." Nearby shops also sold special light novel merchandise.

==Trivia==
*The fan fiction stalls outside the [[Outlander Affairs Agency]] seem to take inspiration from Japanese doujin conventions such as {{w|Comiket}}, where the practice of self-publishing fan works known as ''doujinshi'' is common in Japan.
