==History==
The Irodori Festival originated from the legend of [[The Five Kasen]] who were gifted singers and poetry writers of ancient Inazuma.<ref name="Festive Elegance">{{Ref/Quest|Festive Elegance}}</ref> The Five Kasen brought a cultural revolution to the nation. As a sign of the people's appreciation towards the works of the The Five Kasen, the Irodori Festival was developed.

However, the tales of the Five Kasen were gradually forgotten and the related Iridori Festival also faded from Inazuma's customs over time.<ref name="Festive Elegance" /> After the abolition of the [[Sakoku Decree]], [[Yae Miko]] decided to revive the festival by holding an international cultural convention featuring light novels, which she considers a representation of the modern Inazuman culture, as opposed to how poems represented ancient Inazuman culture.

During this renewed version of the festival, the small plaza in front of the [[International Trade Association]] was called "The Five Kasen Plaza." Nearby shops also sold special light novel merchandise.

==Trivia==
* The name "Irodori Festival" (Japanese: 光華姿の彩り祭 ''Kouka Sugata no Irodori Sai'') may be taken from the {{w|kabuki}} [https://www.kabuki21.com/rsi.php Rokkasen Sugata no Irodori] (Japanese: 六歌仙容彩), which its content is about the {{w|Rokkasen}}. Coincidentally, this is also a basis for the topic of the festival: [[The Five Kasen]], which based on the Rokkasen.
* The fan fiction stalls outside the [[Outlander Affairs Agency]] seem to take inspiration from Japanese doujin conventions such as {{w|Comiket}}, where the practice of self-publishing fan works known as ''doujinshi'' is common in Japan.
