{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Try to enter [[Chioriya Boutique]])
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Chiori said that she needs all the time she can get to make the clothes for the fashion show. Best not to disturb her for now...)

;(Pass time)
;(Talk to Chiori)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, you're here.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chiori! How are the new outfits coming along? Uh, you look kinda tired.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Just a few steps left, now. I've handed the rest over to Eloffe. We should be able to make tonight's show.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's cutting it real close... Are you sure she'll be okay without you?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Don't worry, I have no intention of giving ground on either front. With the fashion show scheduled for tonight, Uther has closed his factory &mdash; this is our only chance to secure any incriminating evidence.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, Paimon totally gets that this is all his fault and he totally deserves it, but wouldn't we technically be trespassing on his property if we just barge in like this?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' His factory is usually open to the public. It may not be open for business right now, but that doesn't mean visitors can't stop by for a tour.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We're just curious customers after all, aren't we?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, when you put it that way...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Anyway, Uther's factory is right over there. Let's hurry up and get moving.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Why would he open a factory over... there?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We have different marketing strategies. While I specialize in high-end, custom garments, he prefers low prices and large sales volumes. I dunno... Maybe the rent here is cheap.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright... It's really creepy. Paimon would never choose to buy anything from a place like that.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 1 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You make a good point. Let's all be on our guard.
----
;(Enter the factory)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're in! There really is nobody here.

;(Approach the guide)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 shoprobot 01.ogg}} '''Mechanical Guide:''' Welcome, dear visitors.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' AHHHH! Paimon nearly fell out of the air! What is that thing?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' A mechanical guide. They usually use a recorded tape to give you a tour of the factory.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 shoprobot 02.ogg}} '''Mechanical Guide:''' Please follow me, dear guests.

;(Stop at the guide's first location)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 shoprobot 03.ogg}} '''Mechanical Guide:''' First stop on our tour is a look at the gradual evolution of our clothing brand.

;(Stop at the guide's second location)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 shoprobot 04.ogg}} '''Mechanical Guide:''' After that, we welcome you to peruse our most popular styles.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Uther seems to be doing pretty well for himself, doesn't he? Why would he feel a need to bother you, when he could just focus on improving his own brand?

;(Stop at the guide's third location)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 shoprobot 05.ogg}} '''Mechanical Guide:''' This is the studio where our designs are made. Please take a look around at your leisure.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep... This seems like Uther's workspace, alright. Let's see what we can find!

;(Investigate the Notes on the Table)
:'''Notes on the Table:''' (The courier... shall arrive at the city... in the morning, via...)

;(Investigate the Paper on the Bookshelf)
:'''Paper on the Bookshelf:''' (Some examples of Uther's old designs. There's nothing strange about them.)

;(Investigate the Notebook Memorandum)
:'''Notebook Memorandum:''' (Marketing expenses: 100,000 Mora. Employment expenses: 200,000 Mora. Material expenses...)

;(After investigating the three locations)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 shoprobot 06.ogg}} '''Mechanical Guide:''' These are the fitting rooms. Please use them at your leisure.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? There seems to be something in this fitting room...

;(Investigate the fitting room)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? Why did the door just close?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hold on tight, Paimon!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Argh! Why... Why is it moving!?

:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...It seems to have stopped.

;(Exit the fitting room)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where did this thing take us?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It seems like... we're someplace deeper inside the factory.

;(Approach the meka guarding the chest)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look out! There are guards here!

;(Enter deeper into the factory)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This place is filthy... Are the clothes from Uther's shop seriously made here?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Look over there.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... That water looks super nasty. Paimon can smell the stench from all the way over here...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmph... And I was the one using unsafe materials, Uther?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So he was actually the one who opened an underground factory...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No wonder his clothes always felt weird to the touch...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' He's been using all manner of tricks here in a bid to cut costs.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Should... Should the clothes made here even be worn?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Never mind issues with shrinking and fading... These materials can give you skin problems if you wear them too often.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's terrifying... Let's take some photos right away as evidence!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This way, he won't be able to try and deny anything in court! Alright, let's keep going.

;(After Chiori's Elemental Skill tutorial)<!-- using the skill isn't required for this -->
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, doesn't look like there's a path here.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 3 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Follow me. Let's go up.

;(Pass through the door)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This place seems like some kind of warehouse. Blech... And it stinks, too.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? What's going on? Our way in's been blocked!
:{{DIcon}} He wants to trap us in the factory...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Seems like he knew we'd be coming.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You did say he knew you really well, didn't you?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yes. And that's because... we used to be partners.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' B&mdash;But you're practically at each other's throats! Now you're telling us you used to work together!?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' When I first came to Fontaine, we were both fledging designers who longed to gain a foothold in the world of fashion. We shared the same goal, so we decided to work together.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' In the beginning, we both wanted to make clothes that would stand out from the crowd and shatter tradition &mdash; the kind of clothes that would turn heads and leave people in awe.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But with every criticism we received, and every sponsor that rejected us... Uther's confidence disappeared little by little.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Finally, right before Fashion Week, he came to the conclusion that we wouldn't be able to make the designs we always dreamed of, and we parted ways.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' For my part, I gambled it all and devoted everything I had to that one week... I came out the other side with something that really made me proud. I was nervous to present it, of course, but I knew it was my chance to show the industry what I was made of. In the end, well...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You received the acclaim of all Fontaine, while Uther gave up on his dream and turned to making this dodgy stuff?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I don't know the exact details of what happened after that. All I know is, after I opened Chioriya Boutique, he's harassed me every year since.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph! He's just jealous of what you've accomplished. A guy like that doesn't deserve your sympathy.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, let's focus on getting out of here first.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Missing the show is as good as letting him win.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, there are some control panels over there! Let's see if any of those buttons do anything!

;(Interact with the first console)<!-- interacting order seems to not matter. -->
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That doesn't seem to have done anything... Maybe try the next one?

;(Interact with the second console)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That didn't do anything either...

;(Interact with the third console, repeats every 15 seconds)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 factoryreminder 01.ogg}} '''Factory Broadcast:''' Warning! Warning! Unauthorized intruders! Entering expulsion mode!

;(After defeating the meka)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Look over there. Seems like there's a way out.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Maybe we can use these mechanisms to get higher.

;(After leaving the room)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... We finally made it out...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why does it feel like the movement patterns of those meks have changed?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 factoryreminder 02.ogg}} '''Factory Broadcast:''' Warning! Warning! Unauthorized intruders! Initiating shutdown procedure!

;(Repeats every 18 seconds)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 factoryreminder 02.ogg}} '''Factory Broadcast:''' Warning! Warning! Unauthorized intruders! Initiating shutdown procedure!

;(Exit the water current)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew! We're finally out of that stinky place...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's take this evidence and get out of here.

;(Leave the factory)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Finally! The entrance... at last...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 01.ogg}} '''Uther:''' ...Oh? Those chambers couldn't hold you, I see. What a surprise.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've collected a bunch of evidence on all the nasty stuff happening at your factory! You're not getting away this time, Uther!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 02.ogg}} '''Uther:''' The evidence on your person, you mean? Hah, what makes you think I have any intention of letting it get past these walls?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...More mechanical guards? Really? Ever thought about using these funds for a legitimate purpose?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 03.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Oh, but this is a legitimate purpose.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' What? Destroying Chioriya Boutique? Or continuing to make your rotten rags?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 04.ogg}} '''Uther:''' &mdash;Proving that "fashion" is merely a laughable farce, a carnival of ignorance!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...You know what your problem is, Uther? You've become so obsessed with the concept of "fashion" itself, that you let it paralyze you. Stop trying to cater to it. Focus on your own work, and you get to decide what "fashion" means!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 05.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Spare me the lecture, why don't you. Sooner or later, you'll cater to all the voices too, you know. After all, what is "fashion" but another form of public opinion?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Fashion is about aspiring towards a certain ideal, but it's up to you to decide what it is. My brand caters to no one but myself and my vision &mdash; that's my ideal, and it's not going to change.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 06.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Hmph. Well, once the people witness their former darling's spectacular fall, they'll understand how laughable that ideal truly is.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That's what you've been trying to prove all this time? Your jaded understanding of the industry is the reason you've had it out for my brand for so long?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...You weren't like this before, Uther. What happened to the man who wanted to make something that would bring the entire world to its knees?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 08.ogg}} '''Uther:''' He realized long ago how utterly naive and ridiculous that dream was!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...You gave up on your dream, but that wasn't enough, was it? You had to find a way to prove to yourself that it could never have been possible at all.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You think you understand... but you're just a bitter man who let his regrets dictate his choices. You regret giving up on your dream, so you stopped at nothing to prove to yourself that it wasn't the wrong choice.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' This whole thing, Uther &mdash; It's pathetic.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 09.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Pathetic? Why don't you take a look in the mirror? You're a fool daydreaming about "taking all of Teyvat by storm." Well, good luck doing that when even Fontaine doesn't have a place for you anymore!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...You're right. Maybe all those who pursue their dreams are fools.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But more pitiful still are cowards who are too afraid to even attempt what the fool is brave enough to try.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 10.ogg}} '''Uther:''' You...!
:{{DIcon}} ...Chiori, you go first.
:{{DIcon}} ...You've got a show to catch.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, just leave this guy to us!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No, you go instead.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... He has a gun...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It'll be fine. Just go to the venue and tell everyone to proceed with the plan.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I'll deal with him. Some lessons... are best delivered in person.
:{{DIcon}} ...Alright.
:{{DIcon}} ...Stay safe.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Catch up with us soon!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 11.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Trying to leave, are we?
:{{Color|menu|The sound of clashing metal is heard.}}
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I've held back all this time because of our past partnership, Uther...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 12.ogg}} '''Uther:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 17.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But all that changed after our "tour" of your factory.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 13.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Hmph... Still trying to talk tough, I see.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 18.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No matter what you've been through, no matter why you've become like this...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 19.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' If I may borrow the words of a friend &mdash; a guy like you doesn't deserve my sympathy.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 uther 14.ogg}} '''Uther:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 5 chiori 20.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Allow me to show you... the true meaning of the Chioriya brand.

:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Perfect.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Phew!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ooh! That looks great! Miss Chiori, can I take a picture?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Of course.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I didn't know you'd made a brand-new signboard!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I made it before Fashion Week. I figured it'd be best to put it up after the success of the show.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, how can you become renowned through all of Teyvat without a fancy signboard of your own? The [[Spina di Rosula|Spina]]'s way ahead of you in that regard!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Now that you mention it, perhaps our magic troupe could use one of those.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Our signatures are the Grin-Malkin Cat and the Bogglecat Box. Oh, and we'd need to add [[Pers]] as well.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Pers would need an alias, of course. Hmm, how about... the "Hangry Bird"?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Pfft... Hahaha!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' So does that mean your signboard is going to be... two cats and a penguin stuffed into a single hat?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ooh, that sounds super snuggly and warm!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' And a bit cramped...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Miss Chiori! I'm done taking pictures. You can expect the article in tomorrow's Steambird, along with the evidence {{Traveler}} gathered!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Thank you, Charlotte.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It's my pleasure! Bringing the truth to light is a journalist's duty.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Going forward, feel free to custom-order any accessories you need for Monsieur Verite. It's on the house.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Huh!? Y&mdash;You really mean it?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Of course. The same goes for you too, Lyney, Lynette. If you have need of any costumes in future, just drop me a note.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' What about something other than a costume?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Thank you, Chiori. It's much appreciated.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, I don't really need anything! Just don't be a stranger, alright?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I don't need anything, either! So long as you continue to request my international courier services from Komaniya Express, we're golden!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Actually, that reminds me... When will you be leaving, Kirara?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh!? Erm... About that...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The Spina di Rosula has prepared a special vehicle for you, so you can just get in, and we'll push it all the way out of Fontaine!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Glad to hear you've toned it down this time...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, do we get something nice too, Chiori?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Of course. Just hold on a second...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Disrupting public order at the show, appropriating venue lighting equipment without authorization, using weaponry in public, hosting a dangerous performance without notifying the authorities...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, Chevreuse, we can explain...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...If you come across anyone who matches those descriptions, please report them to the Special Patrol at your earliest convenience.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Enjoyed that, didn't you? You nearly scared me half to death!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Says the one who pulled that stunt earlier. How about you do me a favor and tell me in advance next time you're planning something like that?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And if I had, would you have approved?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' No, but it would've at least spared me a whole lot of anxiety.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, I would say I've more than made it up to you, have I not? A whole underground workshop in the Fleuve Cendre, and the man responsible all tied up and handed to you on a silver platter! Sounds pretty thoughtful, if you ask me.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...Alright, I won't argue with you. You can have this one.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, friends, I would say we've earned ourselves a nice meal for our efforts! Let's go! Spina's treat!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I'll have to take a raincheck. I've still got a lot of paperwork to take care of, so you all go have fun.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' By the way, Chiori, I ran into [[Wenger]] on the way here. He had a message for you.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I don't need to hear it &mdash; I'm sure the old fool used pretty much every apology in the book. I'll just visit him some other day and give him a hard time about everything.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Hah, you know him well.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Thanks again, Chevreuse.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' My pleasure. Oh, and one last thing&mdash;
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' That was really quite an amazing show.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You don't say?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, alright, follow me if you want in on the celebration feast! Come on, we're leaving!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, could you go wait for me at that place with the view? I'll let Navia know that we'll be a little late. There's something I'd like to give you.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A place with a view? Ooh! Paimon knows where you mean! Sure, no problem!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 6 chiori 17.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Perfect. I'll be right there.
----
;(Approach the cliffside)
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Sorry to keep you waiting.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We didn't wait long at all! But what did you wanna give us that you couldn't share right in front of everyone else?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Here. Take this.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh wow... a brooch! And in the style of Chioriya Boutique, too! Wait, Paimon gets one as well?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I've only made two for now. After much consideration, I decided to give them to you two.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you...
:{{DIcon}} I'll take good care of it.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You've been a great help. Even when things were looking bleak, you stayed by my side.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' There were even times when I felt like I had to fight back and win, even if it was just to honor the trust that you had in me.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we may have helped a little, but Paimon would say you deserve most of the credit. This result... It was all you, Chiori!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I know for certain that was not the case.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I've chased my dream for so long that I've come to understand something...
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Apart from conviction and persistence, the thing that matters the most is having friends who believe in you even when you don't believe in yourself.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' A single person can only do so much. Without all your help, Chioriya Boutique could have easily fallen to ruin.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon doesn't think it would have ever gotten to that point... Not if you had anything to say about it. But, um, about the stuff you said at the show... You aren't worried it'll rub some people the wrong way?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Perhaps my words were a little pretentious, but they do reflect how I truly feel. I won't bow or scrape before any force in this world, much less any individual.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I'm confident in the quality of my work. Create something beautiful, and there will always be people who appreciate it.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, guess there's nothing to worry about, then!
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Should we go back and join them at the victory feast?
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh yes, of course. But before that, I'd like to admire the view for just a little while longer.
:{{A|vo qzlq003 7 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You know? Of all the nights I've spent in Fontaine, I'd say this is the loveliest by far.
