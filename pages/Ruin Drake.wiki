'''Ruin Drakes''' are an enemy group found in [[Sumeru]]. As their name indicates, their appearance and abilities of these [[Ruin Machine]]s are inspired by [[dragon]]s and [[vishap]]s.

In combat, Ruin Drakes mainly use [[Physical]] attacks and have high [[Physical RES]]. Ruin Drakes have the unique special ability to adapt to use and counteract elements, which occurs every time after using their special attack, Confetti, where they absorb element that they have taken the most DMG from, gaining [[Resistance]] to that element and converting the next Confetti's damage type to that of absorbed element. The absorbed element is reflected by the color of [[Chaos Storage]] embedded in their neck. Ruin Drakes expose weak points at their noses, thrusters and bellies during certain attacks, which the player can hit to paralyze them.
