'''Ruin Drakes''' are an enemy group found in [[Sumeru]] and [[Fontaine]]. As their name indicates, their appearance and abilities of these [[Ruin Machine]]s are inspired by [[dragon]]s and [[vishap]]s.

In combat, Ruin Drakes mainly use [[Physical]] attacks and have high [[Physical RES]]. Ruin Drakes have the unique special ability to adapt to use and counteract elements, which occurs every time after using their special attack, Energy Surge, where they absorb element that they have taken the most DMG from, gaining [[Resistance]] to that element and converting the next surge damage type to that of absorbed element. The absorbed element is reflected by the color of [[Chaos Storage]] embedded in their neck. 

While using specific attacks, Ruin Drakes will expose their weak spots. Like [[Ruin Sentinel]]s, Ruin Drakes expose their weak spot(s) specific attacks. Attacking it once will paralyze the Ruin Drake, removing any absorbed element if applicable. Airborne Ruin Drakes additionally have two weak spots on their thrusters which are always active, and attacking both in quick succession will likewise paralyze them.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A war machine that is said to be left behind by [[Khaenri'ah|a now-destroyed nation]]. It mimics the appearance of the beings known as [[Vishap]]s. As an ancient life form, Vishaps have the ability to "absorb" &mdash; or perhaps the right word is "counteract" &mdash; elemental powers. To enhance that ability, the Ruin Drakes were built with some structural and functional enhancements, and its energy system has a unique design.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
