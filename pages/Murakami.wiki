==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Murakami:''' Greetings, we sell festival snacks here. Would you like to try some?
:{{DIcon}} Festival snacks...
::'''Murakami:''' Ha, though we called them festival snacks, they really are no different from ordinary dishes. The difference lies in the wrappings.
::'''Murakami:''' It's just as delicious, though! Besides, food you eat at festivals always feel a little more special somehow, don't they?
::'''Murakami:''' Either way, my shop is always open whether there's an event on or not. You're welcome to come and stuff your face if you ever get hungry.
:{{DIcon}} Long time no see! ''(available after completing [[With You]])''
::'''Murakami:''' My, my, if it isn't Miss Kamisato's friend. Welcome!
::'''Murakami:''' Ever since you brought Miss Kamisato here last time, we've been having more and more people come to try our Sakura Mochi and Egg Rolls!
::'''Murakami:''' I'll definitely take good care of you and Miss Kamisato the next time you two come again.
::'''Murakami:''' Say, have you mastered the Sakura Mochi recipe yet?
::{{DIcon}} I've almost got it down.
::'''Murakami:''' I like that confidence!
::'''Murakami:''' I was about to say that you can come and ask me if you have any issues with the recipe, but it seems like you've got it all under control!
::'''Murakami:''' Ah, it'd be wonderful if everyone was able to enjoy delicious food that they made by themselves.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Murakami:''' Remember to come back again if you're ever hungry!
