'''Genius Invokation TCG''' is a trading card game originating from [[Sumeru]].

==History==
The game was invented by [[Garvipidam]] and [[Gulab]] as a means of spending time while the latter was afflicted with [[Eleazar]]. The game became popular in the hospital that Gulab was staying in, but he died before the card game could become famous outside of the hospital.<ref name="King of Invokations Q">{{Ref/Quest|King of Invokations}}</ref><ref name="culminate">{{Ref/Quest|Culminate! Chatter of Joyous Dreams}}</ref>

Garvipidam became depressed after Gulab's death,<ref name="culminate"/> and he never appeared in public since then and lived in seclusion.<ref name="commence">{{Ref/Quest|Commence! A Suspect Genesis}}</ref> He likely yielded the copyright to another group of researchers, who went on to flesh out the rules and even wanted to create a new version of the TCG.<ref name="King of Invokations Q" />

It was an unspecified Sumeru researcher who commissioned [[Liben]] to bring the prototype TCG to [[Yae Publishing House]] in [[Inazuma]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Liben|condition=during [[Marvelous Merchandise/2021-12-27]]}}</ref> Since then, the TCG has quickly spread through Inazuma and become popular all over Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Iris (Sumeru City)}}</ref> [[Puspa Café]] in [[Sumeru City]] is a common spot for players of the TCG to play.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Nayab}}</ref> In [[Mondstadt City]], players gravitated to [[The Cat's Tail]] tavern to play, so much that owner [[Margaret]] decided to have dedicated staff for catering to her new clients.<ref name="Come Try"/>

Genius Invokation TCG has become quite fashionable among those that would play [[Ningguang]]'s Liyue Millennial chess game with her. This has made it far more difficult for her to get a game going.<ref>[[Birthday/Ningguang#Mail]]</ref>

==Genius Invokation TCG Society==
The Genius Invokation TCG Society is the society that keeps a register of official players, manages [[Lucky Coin]]s, and creates cards.<ref name="Come Try">{{Ref/Quest|Come Try Genius Invokation TCG!}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Casket of Tomes}}</ref> They also invite qualified players to complete [[Ascension Challenge]]s once they deem those players ready.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ascension Challenge I}}</ref>

==King of Invokations==

===Development===
The book series ''King of Invokations'' was written by the Inazuman author [[Fukumoto (King of Invokations)|Fukumoto]] at the request of Sumeru Akademiya researchers in order to promote Genius Invokation TCG. [[Asagiri]] provided the illustrations for the series. Pose references were provided by the [[Traveler]] for the second book<ref name="King of Invokations Q"/> and [[Cyno]] for the third book.<ref name="Next Time">{{Ref/Quest|Next Time, On King of Invokations...}}</ref>

When he first began work on the book, the rules of the game had not been finalized, and since communication between Sumeru and Inazuma was slow, he struggled with the writing process.<ref name="King of Invokations Q" /> After he finished the first novel and published it through [[Yae Publishing House]], it drove the sales of Genius Invokation TCG. The Akademiya researchers came up with a new version of the game, and Fukumoto was asked to write a sequel based on this. After attending a meeting with the researchers at the Akademiya, he stayed in Sumeru to work on the sequel and gather inspiration.<ref name="King of Invokations Q" />

Even after finishing the first novel and learning the rules of the TCG, Fukumoto still struggled to find ways to make the novel more exciting, especially as it was centered around a card game.<ref name="King of Invokations Q" /> While working on the third novel in the series, Fukumoto became frustrated with the development process of the game and the behavior of the researchers; he came up with new mechanics entirely instead of writing about traditional TCG gameplay.<ref name="Next Time" />

The bow [[Ibis Piercer]] was created to promote the final volume of ''King of Invokations'', though the Yae Publishing House had only intended to order a sample bow, not a real weapon. Even though the weapon's existence was a mistake, Fukumoto was inspired by it, and added an excerpt to the book explaining the story behind the bow.<ref name="Ibis Piercer">{{Ref/Weapon|Ibis Piercer}}</ref>

===Story===
{{See Also|King of Invokations (Book)}}
The premise of the story is that a young man from Sumeru named Abu<ref name="King of Invokations B">{{Ref/Book|King of Invokations (Book)}}</ref> discovers an ancient [[Casket of Tomes]] in his attic. Inside, he finds the soul of the Crocodile King, the viceroy of [[King Deshret]] and a player of Genius Invokation TCG. The Crocodile King was sealed inside the Casket of Tomes by an opponent called the Ibis King due to his desire for war.<ref name="Come Try" />

Abu is possessed by the Crocodile King, who transforms him into a legendary Genius Invokation TCG player.<ref name="Come Try" /> At some point, the Crocodile King stopped possessing Abu and got his own body.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Ibis Piercer|q=He heard the sound of the table being activated again in the "Room of Duels", and guessed that the young man whose his remnant soul had once possessed was eagerly waiting for a duel.}}</ref> King of Invokations #1 concludes with Abu defeating the Crocodile King in a duel with all of Abu's allies watching from afar. However, at the end of the duel when the Crocodile King was on the verge of death, Abu reflected on how boring the world would be without him, and made an uncharacteristic wish for a bloody war, allowing the Crocodile King to continue to live.<ref name="King of Invokations B" />

The protagonist of the game is said to use a slower deck that continuously accumulates resources, rather than a deck that quickly eliminates other characters.<ref name="Next Time" /> The opponent used [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Kuroda/Duel: Kuroda|a powerful deck]] featuring [[Mirror Maiden (Character Card)|Mirror Maiden]], [[Mona (Character Card)|Mona]], and [[Bennett (Character Card)|Bennett]].

Due to a desire to make the story more exciting, various elements were included in the story which are not present in typical Genius Invokation TCG gameplay:
* In the second novel, the characters play cards while riding on horses.<ref name="King of Invokations Q" />
* In the first two novels, the main character often wins only because he somehow gets a card that wasn't originally in his deck.<ref name="Next Time" />
* In the third book, actual Genius Invokation TCG gameplay is not included; rather, the characters collect cards that are suspended in midair.<ref name="Next Time" />

==Trivia==
* Dragon-themed decks exist in the TCG.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/HHm6QptfeYU?t=275 Collected Miscellany - "Cyno: Path of the Lone Wolf"]</ref>
