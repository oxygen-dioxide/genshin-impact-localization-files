|text    = Today is the birthday of The Great Astrologist Mona! This special day only comes once a year, so we should go all out and have a big celebration!

But alas... upon closer inspection of the shopping list, there are too many things to buy. If I bought it all, I wouldn't be able to pay my rent next month. Oh well, I'll just have to think about it later.

I've been looking for more ways to make a living, so I got a few volumes of [[Teachings of Gold]]... but I don't know if I didn't read them well enough or if they actually had nothing to do with earning [[Mora]] at all. They didn't work for me, but maybe they might work for you. If you find them useful, do keep them.

If you have time, let's meet up. It'll be the end of the month soon, so with the month's expenses out of the way, Mora shouldn't be a problem! Anyway, let's have a nice meal together!
