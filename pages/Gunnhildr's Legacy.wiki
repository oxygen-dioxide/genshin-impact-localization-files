'''Gunnhildr's Legacy''' is [[Jean]]'s Alternate [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Jean's hair is tied back into a high ponytail with a black bow. On her ears, she wears a pair of gold cross earrings.

She wears a sleeveless black button-up under a white vest with a long blue tailcoat attached to it, a pair of separate black sleeves, a short blue and gold cloak attached to a white collar, white tights embroidered with a gold diamond-dot pattern, a pair of white high-heeled knee-high boots, and a pair of white gauntlets. There is a golden [[Knights of Favonius]] crest on the front of her vest. Her [[Vision]] hangs off her belt at her back on her left.

===Glowing Ornaments===
{{Glowing Ornament Info|outfit=Gunnhildr's Legacy|ornaments=the green gem on her collar and the two green gems on her belt}}

==Description==
"Big Sis, these clothes are yours, right? I found them while sorting things out in the room..."<br>
The folded ceremonial clothes in {{sic|[[Barbara]]}} hands had the [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]]' crest on it, which shone with a golden light as it caught the sun's rays.<br>
It looked familiar, true, but Jean was very sure that she had never owned such a set of clothes before.<br>
Come to think of it, the uniform she usually wore was hand-sewn by [[Frederica Gunnhildr|her mother]].<br>
"Wait... could that be yours, Mother?"

Frederica smiled as her daughter asked this question &mdash; a rare sight to see on her face.<br>
"Ah, it's been so long. So, [[Seamus Pegg|Seamus]] still kept it, huh?"<br>
"Those were the clothes I wore when they granted me the title of 'Alder Knight.' You can take them, if you don't mind."<br>
The seedlings of yesteryear have grown strong, and with their shade they shelter the land they know so well.<br>
The glories of the past have been passed on, and they shine every brighter for it.<br>
They saluted each other first as knights would &mdash; then immediately embraced as only family long-overdue for a reunion might.
