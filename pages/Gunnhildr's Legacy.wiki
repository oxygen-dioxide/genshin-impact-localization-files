'''Gunnhildr's Legacy''' is [[Jean]]'s Alternate [[Character Outfit]].

==Lore==
"Big Sis, these clothes are yours, right? I found them while sorting things out in the room..."<br />
The folded ceremonial clothes in {{sic|[[Barbara]]}} hands had the [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]]' crest on it, which shone with a golden light as it caught the sun's rays.<br />
It looked familiar, true, but Jean was very sure that she had never owned such a set of clothes before.<br />
Come to think of it, the uniform she usually wore was hand-sewn by [[Frederica Gunnhildr|her mother]].<br />
"Wait... could that be yours, Mother?"

Frederica smiled as her daughter asked this question &mdash; a rare sight to see on her face.<br />
"Ah, it's been so long. So, [[Seamus Pegg|Seamus]] still kept it, huh?"<br />
"Those were the clothes I wore when they granted me the title of 'Alder Knight.' You can take them, if you don't mind."<br />
The seedlings of yesteryear have grown strong, and with their shade they shelter the land they know so well.<br />
The glories of the past have been passed on, and they shine every brighter for it.<br />
They saluted each other first as knights would &mdash; then immediately embraced as only family long-overdue for a reunion might.
