==Personality==
{{Quote|The secretary at [[Yuehai Pavilion]]. The blood of the qilin, an illuminated beast, flows within her veins.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Ganyu is usually very meek, mild-mannered, and reserved due to her half-qilin heritage, and is easily flustered. She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Keqing|About Ganyu: Skepticism}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chef Mao}}</ref> Privately, she tends to snap whenever people speak ill of [[Beidou]]<ref>{{Ref/VO|Ganyu|About Beidou}}</ref> or the Geo Archon. She greatly respects her fellow adepti, especially [[Xiao]] and [[Cloud Retainer]], seeing them as a mentor and a maternal figure respectively, although she becomes extremely anxious in the latter's presence due to her tendency to unintentionally ramble.

Ganyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|2}}</ref>

She has a huge work schedule, often working overtime and is prone to falling asleep. As a result, Ganyu has very few friends outside of work. Due to her age, she is very forgetful, and she often forgets important details which causes her much embarrassment. She is very sensitive about her horns, weight and childhood, becoming visibly flustered when any of these three are mentioned in front of her.

==Appearance==
{{See also|Frostdew Trail|Twilight Blossom}}
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Ganyu uses the [[:Category:Medium Female Characters|medium female]] model. She has fair skin and cerulean blue hair that naturally bunches in the middle and fades into a darker shade at the ends. She has black-red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. She has eyes that appear to exhibit {{w|Heterochromia_iridum#Sectoral|sectoral heterochromia}}, fading from purple at the top to pinkish-gold at the bottom.

{{Quote|It is said that the qilin carry an auspicious grace, yet who knows of the loneliness of a benevolent being among the sea of people?|Tianshu of the Liyue Qixing}}

For the Liyue Qixing of the lofty Yujing Terrace, Ganyu is not merely a companion to serve them, but is instead coordinator of the web of information that moves across Liyue Harbor, and the architect of administrative efficiency.

Complex meeting minutes, disorderly report data... Every day piles of documents flow by like water, each one personally compiled by her into clear and concise words in order to assist the Qixing's every decision and negotiation as they flow through various organizational departments.

In the eons that have gone by, the Qixing have changed with each succession of their posts, while only Ganyu has lived to see the flourishing of Liyue Harbor from beginning to the modern day.

The human blood that runs through her veins makes her reluctant to leave the splendor of the city lights, while her adeptus side leads her to yearn for the gentle serenity of her adeptal homeland.

For the half-human, half-adeptus Ganyu, between the bustling sea of people and the ethereal clustered peaks, which is more fitting to call home?

|text2         = <p>Ganyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. "What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished."</p>

Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.</p><p>One such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.</p><p>Ganyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.</p><p>Later on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.</p><p>Her colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.</p><p>Those who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.</p><p>Those closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused.</p><p>"I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite..."</p><p>Needless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!</p>

They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved &mdash; a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a [[Vision]] appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty.</p>

==Trivia==
* According to [[Xiangling]], Ganyu has a surprisingly large appetite &mdash; Xiangling and [[Chef Mao]] give her an extra-large portion of food on the occasions she eats at Wanmin Restaurant, but she always manages to finish it.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiangling|About Ganyu}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chef Mao}}</ref>
** According to [[Yaoyao]]'s message on the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board#Yaoyao's Message|Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]], Ganyu has a sensitive stomach and cannot handle spicy food.
** Ganyu's [[#Character Story 5|Character Story 5]] suggests that at the time of the Archon War, Ganyu was not as slim as she is today as her waistline "easily" choked a monster to death when it tried to swallow her whole, to her embarrassment. She has since taken efforts to watch her figure.
* Although Ganyu and her Character Stories say she is {{w|vegetarian}}, she may actually be {{w|vegan}}: She says she will decline vegetable fritters that have been fried in animal fat,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Ganyu|Least Favorite Food}}</ref> and during [[Spices From the West]], she declines meatless dishes that include [[Bird Egg]]s or [[Milk]], such as [[Fragrant Almond Tofu]], [[Fragrant Satisfying Salad]], and [[Fragrant Fisherman's Toast]].
** However, the canonicity of playable characters' preferences during Spices From the West is questionable.
*** In the corresponding voice-over (Receiving a Gift: III), Ganyu declines solely on the basis of the dish containing meat, which does not make sense when she declines meatless dishes.
*** [[Zhongli]] politely declines all seafood, including [[Fragrant Grilled Tiger Fish]] and [[Fragrant Mondstadt Grilled Fish]], but his Character Story [[Zhongli/Lore#That Which Rises From the Sea|''That Which Rises From the Sea'']] indicates that he only dislikes tentacled seafood and will happily eat even tentacled seafood that has been cut into small pieces. Zhongli's [[Zhongli/Lore#Character Story 1|''Character Story 1'']] also heavily implies that he has eaten [[Fullmoon Egg]], which uses both cut and whole [[Shrimp]]. It therefore does not make sense that Zhongli declines even Grilled Tiger Fish and Mondstadt Grilled Fish, which are small portions<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Bottomless Appetite}}</ref> of cut fish.
* Ganyu can be seen using [[Amos' Bow]] in a cutscene of the {{Quest|Where the Heart Finds Rest}} in the battle against [[Beisht]].
* Ganyu leaves [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board#Ganyu's Message|her own message]] on the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board, albeit anonymously.
* [[Cloud Retainer]] said that when Ganyu was young, she loved it when her horns were caressed.<ref name="unicorn">{{Ref/Quest|The Illuminated Beast of the Sea of Clouds}}</ref> She also reveals that Ganyu's first encounter with a human was bumping into a pilgrim while falling down a mountain. The experience scared her so much that she hid in a rock's cleft for two days.
* Looking at her character for a period of time causes her to blush.
* Ganyu got to meet [[Guizhong]], the God of Dust, a few times.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul}}</ref>
* There are contradictions regarding when Ganyu signed her contract with Rex Lapis:
** Ganyu tells the Traveler she signed her contract with Rex Lapis shortly after the [[Archon War]] ended around two thousand years ago.<ref name="SF">{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref>
** Her character profile states she signed the contract three thousand years ago, during the Archon War.<ref name="GanyuStoryCD">{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|Character Details}}</ref>
** Zhongli says Ganyu has served the longest of those who honor a contract with Rex Lapis.<ref name="ZL VO">{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|About Ganyu}}</ref> However, there are other adepti whose contracts pre-date the two times given for Ganyu's:
*** Rex Lapis founded Liyue Harbor and signed the first contracts to defend it with the adepti 3,700 years ago,<ref name="TFF">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> after relocating the people from the destroyed [[Guili Assembly]]. [[Cloud Retainer]], [[Moon Carver]], [[Mountain Shaper]], and a qilin, who may be Ganyu herself or another individual, were among those who made that journey.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go}}</ref>
* It has not been stated what happened to Ganyu's parents to cause her to fall under Cloud Retainer's care, as she was already doing so when Ganyu was a child.
* Ganyu's Chinese voice actress ({{zh|林簌}}) is one of the directors of ''Genshin Impact''{{'}}s Chinese voice actors.<ref group="Note">Bilibili: In the [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18Z4y1V7rB CN 1.1 livestream (~ 1:28)], Paimon's VA notes that this is the first time with two of the voice acting directors in one livestream. Jean/Ganyu's VA then proceeds to ask her if she feels pressured by that.</ref> She is also the Chinese voice actress of [[Jean]].
* In the Chinese translation of her Story Quest, [[Uncle Tian]] refers to her as "older sister Ganyu" citing it a childhood name, despite the former looking much more advanced in age, which showcases how much Ganyu has remained unchanged over the years.
* Ganyu is known by these aliases or titles:
** Little Miss Ganyu (CN: older sister Ganyu) (by [[Uncle Tian]])
* In her voice-over ''Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion'', Ganyu mentions a quote from an ancient text saying "Only when days be darker than the darkest night, may a qilin be compelled to fight." In the Chinese version, the corresponding quotation is "{{zh|麟斗则日无光}}," which translates to "The term ''líndǒu'' (lit. "the battle of a female qilin") refers to no light in the sun (that is, eclipse)." The text is from a Chinese esoteric book called {{Lang|''Kǒngyǎntú''|zh=孔演图}} (also known as {{Lang|''Chūnqiū-Yǎnkǒngtú''|zh=春秋演孔图}}) written during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD).<ref>Wikisource: [https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/欽定古今圖書集成/博物彙編/禽蟲典/第056卷 {{zh|欽定古今圖書集成 博物彙編 禽蟲典 第056卷}}]</ref>

===Etymology===
* Ganyu's name ({{zh|甘雨|Gānyǔ}}) literally means "sweet rain," but as a phrase, it refers to "timely rainfall" such as rain after a long drought.
* Her Constellation, "{{wt|Sinae}} {{wt|unicornis|Unicornis}}," is Latin for "Chinese Unicorn," another western name/descriptor for the Qilin.
