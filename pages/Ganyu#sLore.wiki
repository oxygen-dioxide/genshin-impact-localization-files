{{Quote|The secretary to the Liyue Qixing. The blood of both human and illuminated beast flows within her veins.<br />
Graceful and quiet by nature, yet the gentle disposition of qilin sees not even the slightest conflict with even the most arduous of workloads.<br />After all, Ganyu firmly believes that all the work she does is in honor of her contract with Rex Lapis, seeking the well-being of all living things within Liyue.|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/liyue?char=11 Ganyu]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|The secretary at [[Yuehai Pavilion]]. The blood of the qilin, an illuminated beast, flows within her veins.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Ganyu is usually very quiet and reserved due to her half-qilin heritage. She also completes whatever is given to her, whether it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Keqing|About Ganyu – Skepticism}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chef Mao}}</ref> Privately, she tends to snap whenever people speak ill of [[Beidou]]<ref>{{Ref/VO|Ganyu|About Beidou}}</ref> or the Geo Archon.

Ganyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|2}}</ref>

She has a huge work schedule, often working overtime and is prone to falling asleep. As a result, Ganyu has very few friends outside of work. Due to her age, she is very forgetful, and she often forgets important details which causes her much embarrassment. She is very sensitive about her horns, weight and childhood, becoming visibly flustered when any of these three are mentioned in front of her.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
As a half-human, half-adeptus hybrid, Ganyu has characteristics of both regular mortals and features found only in the gods.

Ganyu takes the appearance of a young woman with pale blue hair, fading into a darker shade at the ends. Though she mostly resembles a human, she has black-red horns that bend back along her hair, similar to how a goat's horns look, with brighter red markings on them. Many people confuse it as a headdress, a misconception that Ganyu actively encourages. She has purple multicolored heterochromatic eyes that fade into pink then gold.

Her outfit consists of a black bodysuit with gold accents on the legs underneath a white and purple bodice with long ends similar to a tailcoat, with a separated pair of sleeves to match. Her Cryo [[Vision]] rests on her left hip with a red cloverleaf knot. Her outfit, [[Frostdew Trail]], is described to be as elegant clothing blessed by the mighty and illuminated adepti. Additionally, she wears a golden bell around her neck.

{{Quote|It is said that the qilin carry an auspicious grace, yet who knows of the loneliness of a benevolent being among the sea of people?|Tianshu of the Liyue Qixing}}

For the Liyue Qixing of the lofty Yujing Terrace, Ganyu is not merely a companion to serve them, but is instead coordinator of the web of information that moves across Liyue Harbor, and the architect of administrative efficiency.

Complex meeting minutes, disorderly report data... Every day piles of documents flow by like water, each one personally compiled by her into clear and concise words in order to assist the Qixing's every decision and negotiation as they flow through various organizational departments.

In the eons that have gone by, the Qixing have changed with each succession of their posts, while only Ganyu has lived to see the flourishing of Liyue Harbor from beginning to the modern day.

The human blood that runs through her veins makes her reluctant to leave the splendor of the city lights, while her adeptus side leads her to yearn for the gentle serenity of her adeptal homeland.

For the half-human, half-adeptus Ganyu, between the bustling sea of people and the ethereal clustered peaks, which is more fitting to call home?

|text2         = <p>Ganyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. "What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished."</p>

They do not travel in groups, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved &mdash; a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, they did not stand idle or choose peace when there was none. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a new polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a [[Vision]] appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty.</p>

===In-game===
* According to [[Xiangling]], Ganyu is vegetarian with a surprisingly large appetite &mdash; Xiangling and [[Chef Mao]] give her an extra-large portion of food on the occasions she eats at Wanmin Restaurant, but she always manages to finish it.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiangling|About Ganyu}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chef Mao}}</ref>
** According to [[Yaoyao]]'s message on the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board#Yaoyao's Message|Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]], Ganyu has a sensitive stomach and cannot handle spicy food.
* Ganyu leaves [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board#Ganyu's Message|her own message]] on the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board, albeit anonymously.
*[[Cloud Retainer]] said that when Ganyu was young, she loved it when her horns were caressed.<ref name="unicorn">{{Ref/Quest|Sea of Clouds, Sea of People}}</ref>
* Looking at her character for a period of time causes her to blush.
* Ganyu's Chinese voice actress (林簌) is one of the directors of ''Genshin Impact's'' Chinese voice actors.<ref group="Note">Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18Z4y1V7rB In the CN 1.1 livestream (~ 1:28) Paimon's VA notes that this is the first time with two of the voice acting directors in one livestream. Jean/Ganyu's VA then proceeds to ask her if she feels pressured by that.]</ref> She is also the Chinese voice actress of [[Jean]].
* There are contradictions regarding when Ganyu signed her contract with Rex Lapis:
** Ganyu tells the Traveler she signed her contract with Rex Lapis shortly after the [[Archon War]] ended around two thousand years ago.<ref name="SF">{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref>
** Her character profile states she signed the contract three thousand years ago, during the Archon War.<ref name="GanyuStoryCD">{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|Character Details}}</ref>
** Zhongli says Ganyu has served the longest of those who honor a contract with Rex Lapis.<ref name="ZL VO">{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|About Ganyu}}</ref> However, there are other adepti whose contracts pre-date the two times given for Ganyu's:
*** Rex Lapis founded Liyue Harbor and signed the first contracts to defend it with the adepti 3,700 years ago,<ref name="TFF">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> after relocating the people from the destroyed [[Guili Assembly]]. [[Cloud Retainer]], [[Moon Carver]], [[Mountain Shaper]], and a qilin, who may be Ganyu herself or another individual, were among those who made that journey.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go}}</ref>

*She has trouble working with [[Keqing]] due to her controversial comments about Morax.
*In the Chinese translation of her Story Quest, [[Uncle Tian]] refers to her as "older sister Ganyu" citing it a childhood name, despite the former looking much more advanced in age, which showcases how much Ganyu has remained unchanged over the years.
*Ganyu is known by these aliases or titles:
** Little Miss Ganyu (CN: older sister Ganyu) (by [[Uncle Tian]])
*Ganyu is acquainted with [[Yae Miko]].<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17y4y147fa Version 1.5 Chinese Special Program]</ref>

===Etymology===
*Ganyu's name is likely a reference to {{Lang|'''{{w|Amrita|''Ganlu''}}'''|zh=甘露|zh_tl=Sweet Dew}}, or ''Amrita'' in Sanskrit, a term to describe holy frozen mist in Hinduist-Buddhist legends in South, East, and Southeast Asia. It is said to give immortality or sacred power to those who drink it (roughly equivalent to nectar and ambrosia in the Greek mythology).
*Her Constellation, "{{wt|Sinae}} {{wt|unicornis|Unicornis}}," is Latin for "Chinese Unicorn," another western name/descriptor for the Qilin.
*In her voice-over ''Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion'', Ganyu mentions a quote from an ancient text saying "Only when days be darker than the darkest night, may a qilin be compelled to fight." In the Chinese version, the corresponding quotation is "麟斗则日无光," which translates to "The term ''líndǒu'' (lit. ''the battle of a female qilin'') refers to no light in the sun (that is, eclipse)." The text is from a Chinese esoteric book called {{Lang|''Kǒngyǎntú''|zh=孔演图}} (also known as {{Lang|''Chūnqiū-Yǎnkǒngtú''|zh=春秋演孔图}}) written during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD).<ref>Wikisource: [https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/欽定古今圖書集成/博物彙編/禽蟲典/第056卷 欽定古今圖書集成 博物彙編 禽蟲典 第056卷]</ref>
