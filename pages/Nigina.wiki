::'''Nigina:''' So that leaves my old bones here.
::'''Nigina:''' They have a great future ahead of them, so no complaints from me. I just want to know how they're doing.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Kids will grow up.
:::'''Nigina:''' Right, you're right. I trust them to take care of themselves.
:::'''Nigina:''' It's just that I always cook too much when cooking for myself. How about you take some if you don't mind?
:::'''Nigina:''' It's just some common Sumeru dishes. Hope you'll like it.
::;(Obtain [[Delicious Butter Chicken]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
