==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with Ancient {{sic|Fatui}} Records)
:'''Ancient Fatui Records:''' (An ancient stone carving, with rough patterns cut into it by what appears to be a knife...)
:'''Ancient Fatui Records:''' "[[Chaac|I]] will leave the first knife mark here, to engrave the halls of this darkened world for those that come after me."
:'''Ancient Fatui Records:''' "This is where I make my first call to the night, that those who come after may summon from this departed world the glory of our ancestral spirits."
:'''Ancient Fatui Records:''' "Reach out, those who would follow in my footsteps..."
:'''Ancient Fatui Records:''' "And leave here your mark on history!"
:{{DIcon}} (Reach out to the obsidian pillar...)
:{{Black Screen|You see, appearing before your eyes... the figures of heroes who have come before.<br>[[Xbalanque|A man]] with flaming hair whose smile beams brightly, [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|a travel-worn youth]] whose eyes smolder like the sunset, [[Sanhaj|a child]] with an [[Iktomisaurus]] whose brow is furrowed in thought...<br>And there, a [[Mavuika|familiar silhouette]]. She pauses but for the briefest of moments, then plunges resolutely into five hundred years of solitude.<br>Some faces appear solemn, others mournful, while some still carry a flicker of anger, despite arriving at this place.<br>Yet without exception, they all stand there. Without exception, they have all ended up leaving "themselves" in this place...}}
:{{Black Screen|Countless hands stretch out from the darkness, each clutching [[Ancient Name|glowing stone feathers]], passing them one by one into the distance.<br>Some are swallowed by the darkness, but some still remain as unquenchable flames that adorn the curtain of night like stars.}}
:{{Black Screen|You know that these are "names." And [[Obsidian Ancient Name|one of them]] belongs to you.}}
:'''Ancient Fatui Records:''' (The stone tablet remains as dark as ever, but you know that, somewhere on its surface, you have left an indelible mark...)
