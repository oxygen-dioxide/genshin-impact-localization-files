==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|What secret does the set of archaic admonishments hold?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Soraya:''' Guizhong's Four Commandments... What are they really trying to tell us...
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready.
::'''Soraya:''' Haha, raring to go! That's what I like to see. Then let's begin our reading of Guizhong's Four Commandments.
:{{DIcon}} Let's go find that treasure!!!
::'''Soraya:''' Whew, the slightest mention of treasure and you're suddenly beside yourself with excitement... Hmm so be it &mdash; let's begin our reading of Guizhong's Four Commandments.
:'''Soraya:''' "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition &mdash; the convergence of these four shall be known as the 'Guili Assembly.'"
:'''Soraya:''' On the surface, it does read like a set of commandments. Golden rules for life.
:'''Soraya:''' But it's also supposed to contain some sort of clues to a hidden treasure...
:'''Soraya:''' ...I can't decipher it, though. It seems we'll have to approach this in what academics like to call the old-fashioned way...
:'''Soraya:''' Those seven passages we found previously, they were all located in ruins of some sort.
:'''Soraya:''' Since we're not sure where to start this time, perhaps keep searching in ruins for now.
:{{DIcon}} ...Where exactly?
::'''Soraya:''' Hmm... For now, let's limit the search area to Guili Plains.
::'''Soraya:''' However... as I'm just a scholar, there's no way I'd be able to keep up with you out in the field.
::'''Soraya:''' So I will leave the actual ruin-searching to you. Just let me know what you find.
:{{DIcon}} ...ALL the ruins?
::'''Soraya:''' Obviously not... We'd never be able to cover all the ruins in Liyue just between the two of us.
::'''Soraya:''' So let's limit the search area. Since the treasure has to do with the Guili Assembly from the Guili Plains...
::'''Soraya:''' ...Let's restrict our search to the Guili Plains area for now.
::'''Soraya:''' Oh, and one other thing. There's no way a scholar like me could keep up with you out in the field.
::'''Soraya:''' So I will leave the actual ruin-searching to you. Just let me know what you find.
:{{DIcon}} Ruins of Liyue, here I come!
::'''Soraya:''' Wait! Hold on a second! ...How exactly do you propose to cover every single ruin in Liyue!? It'll take you forever!
::'''Soraya:''' You can't afford to get so excited every time you hear the word treasure, you know.
::'''Soraya:''' How about this &mdash; since we know the treasure comes from the Guili Assembly in the Guili Plains, let's restrict the search area.
::'''Soraya:''' Okay... to start with, let's limit the search to inside Guili Plains...
::'''Soraya:''' Hold on! I'm not finished yet! ...Don't forget to search the ruins thoroughly. And if you find anything of interest, come back and let me know.
::'''Soraya:''' Remember, stick to the Guili Plains! Don't let you boundless enthusiasm lead you further afield.
:'''Soraya:''' While we're on the subject &mdash; I once came across a strange plate with some writing on in one of the ruins around here.
:'''Soraya:''' I only looked at it in isolation though. Didn't do any sort of holistic analysis.
:'''Soraya:''' Now I think about it, it might be connected to Guizhong's Four Commandments.
:'''Soraya:''' How about I mark the location on your map? You should go check it out, maybe it'll lead somewhere.

;(Talk to Soraya again)<section begin="TLTF" />
:'''Soraya:''' I wonder how the Guili Assembly met its demise...
:{{DIcon}} Remind me of Guizhong's Four Commandments.
::'''Soraya:''' Having trouble memorizing them? I understand, most people would. Fortunately, I have a rather good memory for this sort of thing.
::'''Soraya:''' Guizhong's Four Commandments are as follows: "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition &mdash; the convergence of these four shall be known as the 'Guili Assembly.'"
:;(Takes you back to the first line)
:{{DIcon}} A battle for territory between the gods?
::'''Soraya:''' A territorial challenge, you say? Hmm... but the Guili Assembly is said to have existed peacefully under Guizhong's rule for a very long time.
::'''Soraya:''' Not that Guizhong was a particularly powerful god... At least, that's my impression...
::'''Soraya:''' But there seems to have been another god with the Guizhong Assembly besides Guizhong. I highly doubt anyone would have been foolish enough to try and take on two gods at once...
:;(Takes you back to the first line)
:{{DIcon}} Someone wanted the treasure? ''(Unlock requirements unknown)''
::'''Soraya:''' Unlikely. The great gods would not have waged an all-out war over a bit of treasure that took their fancy.
::'''Soraya:''' Or if they did, then you have to ask yourself... What kind of treasure would it take to drive the gods into war with each other?
::'''Soraya:''' ...Haha, I for one cannot imagine such a treasure.
:;(Takes you back to the first line)
:{{DIcon}} Maybe Guizhong and one of the other gods... ''(Unlock requirements unknown)''
::'''Soraya:''' Wh&mdash;What are you suggesting? ...You shouldn't pay any heed to those tall tales you hear in Liyue Harbor.
::'''Soraya:''' Guizhong was a god, a deity... Not a mere mortal...
::'''Soraya:''' ...S&mdash;Surely a god wouldn't... Surely not...
:;(Takes you back to the first line)
:{{DIcon}} I also wonder...
::'''Soraya:''' Maybe it's to do with the Archon War.
::'''Soraya:''' A protracted war erupted between the gods, each of whom coveted a seat at one of the seven divine thrones in [[Celestia]].
::'''Soraya:''' It seems that none in Teyvat escaped the reach of that all-consuming war.
:;(Takes you back to the first line)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Soraya:''' Goodbye. Don't forget to come back and tell me if you find anything.<section end="TLTF" />

;(After investigating first jade plate)
:'''Paimon:''' This looks like the kind of place Soraya was hoping to find.
:'''Paimon:''' If she's right, there should be three more of these around here.
:'''Paimon:''' We'd better keep looking.
;(After investigating second jade plate)
:'''Paimon:''' It's one of the lines from the four commandments.
:'''Paimon:''' Two down, two to go!
;(After investigating third jade plate)
:'''Paimon:''' Another line from those four commandments. This must be one of the places we need to find.
:'''Paimon:''' Just one more to find now. What do you think we'll discover?
;(After investigating fourth jade plate)
:'''Paimon:''' Four ruins, four commandments...
:'''Paimon:''' That's gotta be all of them. Feels like we didn't make any huge discoveries though...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh well, let's get back to Soraya. Maybe she'll see something we don't.
----
;(Return to Soraya)
:'''Soraya:''' Sometimes fate is inescapable, even for a god...
:{{DIcon}} I found four clues in four ruins.
:'''Soraya:''' Four ruins, four clues... And there are Four Commandments.
:'''Soraya:''' Each of these clues expounds upon the meaning of one of the Four Commandments.
:'''Soraya:''' To get to the correct interpretation, the original text of Guizhong's Commandments is key. These four are helpful, but peripheral to our enquiry.
:'''Soraya:''' These five passages are all linked &mdash; but how?
:{{DIcon}} "Convergence..."
:'''Soraya:''' Hmm... Could "convergence" mean that... these four things all link up in some way?
:'''Soraya:''' Wait &mdash; I remember, each of Guizhong's Four Commandments can be found in a specific ruin...
:'''Soraya:''' Hmmm... I am speculating here, but perhaps the four {{Color|buzzword|ruins}} are relevant to deciphering the true meaning of Guizhong's Four Commandments...
:'''Soraya:''' How exactly, I don't know. I need to mull it over. Maybe you could have a think too &mdash; or better still, go and investigate it firsthand.
:'''Soraya:''' I'm just a skinny little scholar after all, I tire out completely after a few seconds on the run... Wish I had your stamina!
:'''Soraya:''' Anyways, I'm going to keep thinking about it for a while. If you think of anything, or if you find anything, you know where I am.
{{Quest Description|update|According to Soraya's deductions, the ruins that contain the four commandment passages may be the key to deciphering Guizhong's Four Commandments and obtaining the treasure.}}
;(Talk to Soraya again)
:'''Soraya:''' It's a speculative hypothesis, but I believe the four ruins corresponding to each of Guizhong's Four Commandments may be relevant to deciphering their true meaning...
:'''Soraya:''' Exactly what role the ruins are supposed to play, well, that's another question. And... I don't think I have the physical strength to test out each of my hypotheses in full...
:'''Soraya:''' It's also possible that I just have a one-track mind, and this idea is leading me nowhere...
----
;(After obtaining treasure)
:'''Paimon:''' Is this the treasure? We should go tell {{Color|buzzword|Soraya}}.
;(Talk to Soraya again)
:'''Soraya:''' How is the search going? Found the treasure yet?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, it was about where they "converge" after all.
:'''Soraya:''' Really... So it's just like Guizhong's Four Commandments says. The treasure was located at "the convergence of these four..."
:'''Soraya:''' Whoever designed this riddle must have truly revered Guizhong.
:'''Soraya:''' So much so that they preserved Guizhong's Four Commandments for future generations, even though the Guili Assembly was wiped out.
:'''Soraya:''' And as for Guizhong herself, who established the commandments &mdash; she must have been adored by her people.
:'''Soraya:''' Clearly, she wished for her people to be wise, to  hold themselves to a moral code, to be strong and healthy, and to find solidarity in the shared enterprise of protecting their home &mdash; the Guili Assembly...
:{{DIcon}} But she failed.
::'''Soraya:''' Failed? I suppose you're right, she died in the end... and when the Guili Assembly was wiped out, her people no longer has a place to call home.
::'''Soraya:''' And yet, today, Guizhong's Four Commandments have seen the light of day once more.
::'''Soraya:''' These were the words penned by Guizhong herself to serve both as maxims and blessing for her people.
::'''Soraya:''' Once there was a time when she led her people to go forth and take this very land, guided by these commandments.
::'''Soraya:''' She may no longer be with us, but her beliefs, the things she stood for &mdash; they will endure.
::'''Soraya:''' Whoever it was that revered her so much was very clever indeed. They used the allure of hidden treasure to ensure Guizhong's Four Commandments would be passed down.
::'''Soraya:''' Though for that person, I wonder whether the treasure they held dear was the rare metals and precious stones, or Guizhong's Four Commandments themselves.
::'''Soraya:''' Haha, well, to me at least, it's clear that the commandments are the real treasures here. A chest full of gold or gems can't compare.
::'''Soraya:''' ...But if you made people choose, how many would really pick a list of commandments over material wealth?
:{{DIcon}} Seems like a gentle-natured god.
::'''Soraya:''' I'm not sure "gentle-natured" is a particularly common trait of gods...
::'''Soraya:''' But maybe it was once. Maybe a long, long time ago, among the gods who led the peoples of the world, there were those gentle by nature.
::'''Soraya:''' Those who protected their people... walked among them... stood by them as they went forth into the world...
::'''Soraya:''' But it was the gentle gods who were ultimately powerless to protect their people. Look at Guizhong &mdash; it took an elaborate treasure hunt just to preserve the four commandments that were once the lifeblood of a whole civilization.
::'''Soraya:''' Haha, well, to me at least, it's clear that the commandments are the real treasures here. A chest full of gold or gems can't compare.
::'''Soraya:''' ...But if you made people choose, how many would really pick a list of commandments over material wealth?
:{{DIcon}} I wish I could meet her...
::'''Soraya:''' You want to meet a god? You do entertain some wild thoughts.
::'''Soraya:''' But I'm curious, what would you say to Guizhong if you actually got to meet her?
::'''Soraya:''' "...Cheer up, Guizhong, you did your best"?
::'''Soraya:''' If it were me... I'd recite Guizhong's Four Commandments flawlessly from memory.
::'''Soraya:''' And I'd tell her that her vision and her ideals were alive and well, that the people of this land still remember the things she taught to their ancestors.
::'''Soraya:''' I think that for someone like Guizhong, who lost everything... That would be the only thing that could lift her spirits.
