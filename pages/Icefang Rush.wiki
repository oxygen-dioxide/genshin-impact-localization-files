==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|a Normal Attack during the Chilling Penalty state while above 50% HP|1}}
** Hitting non-enemy objects will also generate particles.
** This particle generation has a cooldown of 2 seconds, which is shared with the particle generation from {{Talent|There Shall Be a Plea for Justice|text=Rebuke: Vaulting Fist|nobr=1|20}}.
** Charged and Plunging Attacks during Chilling Penalty do ''not'' generate particles.

==Trivia==
* The flavor text "defy your fate, or else this glutton be, to pay your fate's due, by the crime and thee" is a reference to Sonnet 1 from William Shakespeare's {{w|Shakespeare's sonnets|Sonnets}} "from fairest creatures we desire increase." The original line is "pity the world, or else this glutton be / to eat the world's due, by the grave and thee," which is an exhortation by the writer to encourage the reader to bear children or else deny the world the beauty they are due. Rewritten, it now exhorts the reader to defy their fate or else be a glutton that, like crime, consumes the fate that they are due.
