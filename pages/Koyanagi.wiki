In the past, Koyanagi was searching for Bunkaku's Treasure with his friend. They found the secret chamber beneath the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], however it was guarded by [[Sunfire Phantasm]]s and vengeful spirits summoned by Bunkoku.<ref name="enigma">{{Ref/Quest|The Bunkoku Enigma}}</ref> When they entered, Koyanagi was possessed by the vengeful spirit,<ref name="enigma" /> causing him to kill his friend by his own hands. Years later, the [[Traveler]] finds the same chamber and defeats a Vengeful spirit. After defeating it, they free Koyanagi who is now a [[Sinshade]] filled with regret.
