==Profile==
Ross the Quick earned his name for his nimble speed in running away from his chasers. He is likely a member of the [[Treasure Hoarders]], as he dons the attire of a [[Treasure Hoarders: Scout|Treasure Hoarder Scout]] and is from a gang of thieves. Ross had been assigned by his gang to find a place known as the Abandoned City, but did not make any progress and stopped reporting to them. During his search, he was pursued by monsters and ran until he noticed the nearby lake, and now ponders over how he spent his whole life running without any goal.

===Personality===

Ross takes the appearance of a [[Treasure Hoarders: Scout|Treasure Hoarder Scout]].

:'''Ross the Quick:''' Is that a passing traveler I see?
:'''Ross the Quick:''' Sit with me, the view from here is incredible.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Ross the Quick:''' Me...?
::'''Ross the Quick:''' They call me Ross &mdash; Ross the Quick!
::'''Ross the Quick:''' Especially the ones who are always trying to catch me.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Ross the Quick:''' That's a good question... What AM I doing here...
::'''Ross the Quick:''' I lost my way, then I got chased by a boar, then the [[hilichurls]] joined the chase...
::'''Ross the Quick:''' I ran until my legs gave out and my energy was gone &mdash; then I suddenly noticed this lake...
::'''Ross the Quick:''' Then I had this realization that I've spent my whole life running... running for no reason.
::'''Ross the Quick:''' No matter what, right now I am going to give myself a proper rest. Screw missions and all that.
::'''Ross the Quick:''' Although... There is the fact that if I don't report back to the gang soon, they'll fine me something like eight hundred thousand [[Mora]]... I forget how much exactly.
::'''Ross the Quick:''' ...Whatever, screw the gang of thieves too!
::{{DIcon}} ...Y&mdash;you're from a gang of th&mdash;thieves!?
::'''Ross the Quick:''' ...Hmm. Now that you mention it, yes I am.
::'''Ross the Quick:''' Originally my mission was to find this place called the Abandoned City.
::'''Ross the Quick:''' ...But since I haven't reported back on my progress in so long, I've probably technically been kicked out of the gang by now.
::'''Ross the Quick:''' That said, if you're gonna report me, I won't run away...
::'''Ross the Quick:''' ...Either way, let me enjoy this view just a bit longer, won't you?
:{{DIcon}} ...Bye.
::'''Ross the Quick:''' *sigh* Bye then.
