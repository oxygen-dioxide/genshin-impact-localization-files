==Profile==
Intrepid Valberry was originally one of the Five Great Operatives of the [[Fruity Order]], but got kicked out after protesting against the punishment of fellow operative [["Tricky Bulle Fruit"]]. At some point in time he joined the Elegant Tableware Confrerie and became Director 42. After [[The Steambird]] exposed their organization, Intrepid Valberry sent them a warning sign in revenge. He initially planned to stab [[Sir Arthur]] with a table knife, but seeing that Sir Arthur was gone, he stabbed the knife into the pedestal and left.<ref name="red">{{Ref/Quest|The Red and the Black}}</ref>

Intrepid Valberry's first mission was to collect money from [[Rocher]], a man who had been scammed by the Elegant Tableware Confrerie. After one unsuccessful attempt, he and his men searched for Rocher by the pier, but instead ran into [[Talochard]], [["Curve"]], and the [[Traveler]], and were chased off by them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vagrants and Scamps}}</ref> He encountered them again when they investigated the organization's hideout. When [[Boss (The Red and the Black)|Boss]] betrayed him, he fought back against Boss and agreed to assist the group with their investigation.<ref name="red"/>

Later, Intrepid Valberry intercepted Boss in his search for the "treasure" mentioned in the Mysterious Threat Letter and turned him over to the [[Marechaussee Phantom]]. Intrepid Valberry himself was sent to the Fortress of Meropide after the investigation ended.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Questions and Answers}}</ref>

:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Uh... Huh? My eyes aren't playing tricks on me, are they? Since I can actually see you here... Have you also broken the law?
:{{DIcon}} I haven't done anything wrong.
::'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Ha! Done nothing wrong... I know you young'uns all like to save face.
::'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Eh, forget it. I won't ask. Though it seems we're somewhat bound together by fate, so if anyone gives you any trouble, you come tell me, and I'll help you out.
:{{DIcon}} How's life in the Fortress of Meropide?
::'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Do you really need to ask that? You'll know for yourself in a couple days, right?
:{{DIcon}} What orange Bulle Fruit?
::'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' I used to have [["Tricky Bulle Fruit"|a buddy who really liked Bulle Fruit]], and recently I saw that someone had drawn one on the noticeboard. It made me miss him all of a sudden.
::'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Never mind. Poor guy's probably long since left this world. Forget it. Remember to treasure those around you, eh?
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Don't be as arrogant here as you are out there. That's my advice.
