==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Little Zuo:''' Excuse me, have you seen my frog?
:{{DIcon}} What frog?
::'''Little Zuo:''' I just caught a frog, and his back was really slippy, and then I let him get away by accident.
::'''Little Zuo:''' He's a lively little froggie, I was lucky to catch him the first time...
::{{DIcon}} What do you want the frog for?
:::'''Little Zuo:''' I wanna give him to my [[Little You|little sister]] to play with.
:::'''Little Zuo:''' My sister is that girl over there, the one who is always trying to catch her shadow... even though you can't catch your shadow. I don't get why she likes to do that...
:::'''Little Zuo:''' Maybe she just feels bored. At least if I catch her a frog, cashing him will be more fun than chasing her shadow.
:::{{DIcon}} Why don't you play with her?
:::'''Little Zuo:''' I think she doesn't like me very much. She doesn't wanna listen to anything I say, let alone play with me.
:::'''Little Zuo:''' I don't get it, I'm always trying my bestest to find her things she wants, so why won't she be happy with me?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Best of luck to you.
:::'''Little Zuo:''' Thank you! Frogs are super hard to catch, though...
:::'''Little Zuo:''' So far all I've managed to grab is a few lizards, and even then only the tails...
:::'''Little Zuo:''' Maybe you could take them? I've gotta keep trying to catch a frog, and I definitely can't do it with my hands full of lizard tails.
::;(Obtain [[Lizard Tail]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Little Zuo:''' Byeee!

===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Little Zuo:''' Those two weirdos are up to it again...
:'''Little Zuo:''' I often see them coming here to read, but I never expected to encounter them during Lantern Rite as well.
:'''Little Zuo:''' All I hear them talking about is "evil spirits" or somesuch, though. Are they writing a story, by any chance?
;(Continue non-event dialogue)
