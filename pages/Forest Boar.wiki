|description = One of the most energetic residents in [[Teyvat]], boars are found active throughout the wild.<br>This wild animal is characterized by rapid reproduction and a stubborn personality. Able to survive in various conditions, it can be encountered in all sorts of forests and wild terrain. Forest Boar meat is tasty and chewy, making it a prime ingredient for many dishes. In addition, Forest Boars are even central characters in many legends told across Teyvat.<br>The [[Musk family]] ecologists have observed some [[hilichurl]] tribes attempting to domesticate Forest Boars, presumably hoping to train them as riding animals.

'''Forest Boar''' is a type of boar that can be found in the wild.

In the wild, the boar simply wanders around grazing. When it senses or spots a player nearby, the boar will scatter, either running away or charging towards the player before fading away as they flee.
