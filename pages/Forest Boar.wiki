{{Description|One of the most energetic residents in Teyvat, boars are found active throughout the wild.<br />This wild animal is characterized by rapid reproduction and a stubborn personality. Able to survive in various conditions, it can be encountered in all sorts of forests and wild terrain. Forest Boar meat is tasty and chewy, making it a prime ingredient for many dishes. In addition, Forest Boars are even central characters in many legends told across Teyvat.<br />The Musk family ecologists have observed some hilichurl tribes attempting to domesticate Forest Boars, presumably hoping to train them as riding animals.|[[Archive]]}}
'''Forest Boar''' is a type of boar. It can be found both as [[Wildlife]] and as a pet in the [[Serenitea Pot]].

In the wild, the boar simply wanders around grazing. When it senses or spots a player nearby, the boar will scatter, either running away or charging towards the player before fading away as they "flee" the map.

In the Serenitea Pot, boars will not be startled when you approach them, but will scatter when you try to hit them. If they run too far from where they were placed or fall off the map, they will respawn at their original location.

Outdoor animals can only be placed in outdoor spaces within the Serenitea Pot.
