|description    = Fruits and vegetables have been tightly piled together here without any care for how they might affect one another. Perhaps the merchant in question was far too tired to quibble about such details.<br />Placing a [[Mist Flower]] within a sack is an easy solution to the problem, but the price of one Mist Flower may exceed several days' worth of a merchant's income, which makes it an unprofitable proposition.
