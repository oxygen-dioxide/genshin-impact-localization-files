After reaching a total of 1 million participants, all participating Travelers will receive all reward packs (each reward pack is limited to 3 million in quantity).
# When the number of participants reach 1 million, an official waypoint lighting ceremony will be held in the Alps. Players can watch the lighting ceremony online in mid-January 2022 through the Genshin Impact official accounts on Twitch, YouTube, and VK. Please refer to our social media and website announcements for the specific date.
# Take part in the Hang Your Wishes Event (up to 50 characters), as lucky players' wishes will be collected and made into wish cards, which will be hung on the Genshin Impact Tree of Wishes atop the Alps.
