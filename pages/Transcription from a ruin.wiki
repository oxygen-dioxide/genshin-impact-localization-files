'''Transcription from a ruin''' is a quest item obtained during [[Treasure Lost, Treasure Found]].

==Description==
''"...and there they fought upon the Guili Plains, where black dust choked the heavens and a thousand rocks splintered..." The transcript seems to be a record of a terrible war...''

''Guizhong's Four Commandments are: "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition &mdash; the convergence of these four shall be known as the '[[Guili Assembly]].'"...One can bear not to leave one's native land. A treasure lies in Guili, and Guizhong's Four Commandments shall guide those in generations to come who aspire to find it, if they would test themselves against the Four." This transcript seems to be a letter that was left behind by someone...''
