==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ngahue:''' Hello, friend! Where are you off to then? Need some help with directions?
:{{DIcon}} Anything of note nearby?
::'''Ngahue:''' If you head west along this main road by the edge, you'll end up at the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]].
::'''Ngahue:''' People go there to either watch or take part in the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], as well as do a bit of business on the side. You have something I want, I have something you want, type of thing.
::'''Ngahue:''' If you came over from the east, you've probably already run into the [[Children of Echoes]]. Did you buy any gemstones while you were there?
::'''Ngahue:''' If you go south from here, you'll reach the edge of a great cliff where you can test your bravery against that lot from the [[Scions of the Canopy]].
::'''Ngahue:''' Each of their hobbies seems to be more dangerous than the last...
::'''Ngahue:''' And then if you keep heading to the place where there's water, you'll reach my home, the [[People of the Springs]].
::'''Ngahue:''' If you're tired from the journey, you can gaze out to sea, or take a bath in the hot springs.
:{{DIcon}} Any recommendations?
::'''Ngahue:''' And as they say, things don't always pan out as you expected. If you don't have a clear destination, you might as well go with the flow &mdash; or leave your fate in someone else's hands.
::'''Ngahue:''' Are there many other wayfinders like me over at my tribe, you ask?
::'''Ngahue:''' We're not picky about our destination. When we can't decide where to go next, we'll pick up a stick, head over to a [[Statue of the Seven|Statue of the Pyro Archon]], then spin it around on the ground &mdash; and whichever way it points is where we go.
::'''Ngahue:''' Praise be to Lady [[Mavuika|Haborym]]! Whenever I follow her guidance, I always learn something new.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Let's leave the path ahead to fate...
:::'''Ngahue:''' Indeed! Well said! Now that sounds like something the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] might say!
:::'''Ngahue:''' Still, doesn't the saying itself effectively just mean "let's go with the flow"?
:::'''Ngahue:''' Well, not that living that way would be bad. Sometimes things come to you even when you don't take the initiative!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Conflict|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} Not right now.
::'''Ngahue:''' Well then, all that's left is to say &mdash; may your travels be smooth, and may you emerge victorious from every battle!
