Even the fiercest of monsters think twice before trying to hunt them...<br>After being relocated to The Realm Within, these birds, owing to their fierce appearance, assumed a new role &mdash; alongside the teacup lid, they became both spear and shield for [[Tubby]], keeping pastries safe from the greedy beaks of certain avians...
