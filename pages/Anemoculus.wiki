The '''Anemoculus''' is an Adventure Item that can be found scattered across [[Mondstadt]]. Anemoculi can be offered to any [[Statue of The Seven|Statue of the Seven]] in Mondstadt for rewards. Anemoculi can only be found in the overworld, and will not appear in [[chests]]. Anemoculi are also limited and do not respawn.

When an overworld Anemoculus is within close proximity of a player, an icon will appear on their minimap along with a sound effect. Players can also use an [[Anemoculus Resonance Stone]] to be directed to the location of nearby Anemoculi.

66 Anemoculi can be found in the overworld, allowing a player to fully level up the Statues of the Seven in Mondstadt with one Anemoculus to spare.

==Lore==
Anemoculi are consolidated winds found in Teyvat that can only be seen by [[Allogenes]] and the Traveler. It got its name from the words "Anemo" and "Oculi." Since people believe that the original Statues of the Seven had gem eyes that were taken by swallows, Allogenes collect and offer these consolidated winds to receive [[The Seven]]'s blessings.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Blessings of The Seven}}</ref>
