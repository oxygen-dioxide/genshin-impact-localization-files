==Event Details==
===Duration===
2021-06-25 10:00:00 – 2021-07-08 03:59:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above

===Summary===
During the event, Travelers can venture into the event Domain and challenge an all-new, powerful boss to attain points. Once your total score reaches a certain amount, you can claim the [[namecard]] style "[[Celebration: Battlesong]]." The first time you clear each challenge, you will also be rewarded with 60 [[Primogems]].
* Starting on the first day of the event, a new challenge will unlock each day until the seventh day, by which all the challenges will have been unlocked.
* Before you begin the challenge in earnest, you can choose from different difficulty levels and special combat effects known as Flairs. The amount of points you obtain for completing the challenge is based on the difficulty and Flairs selected.
* Travelers can attempt the challenge in either Single Player or Co-Op Mode.
* During the event, Travelers can challenge the same challenge stage multiple times. Try to obtain the highest score that you can for each stage. Your total combined score is the sum of your high scores on all challenge stages. When your total combined score reaches a certain amount, you can claim the corresponding rewards.
* After the event ends, your accumulated points will be lost and you will be unable to claim any more rewards. Remember to claim your rewards in time!

===Special Combat Effects &mdash; Flairs===
Before the challenge begins, you can select the difficulty level as well as special combat effects known as "Flairs." Upon completing the challenge, you will receive points according to the selected difficulty and Flairs used.

Additionally, certain characters will deal 20% increased DMG upon entering the challenge. Each challenge will provide boosts for different characters.

===Points & Rewards Details===
During the event, you can challenge each stage as many times as you wish to get the highest score that you can. Primogems are awarded the first time you complete a given challenge at any difficulty level.

Your total score is the sum of your high scores from each stage. Your high score would not be affected if you attempt the stage again and score lower. If you score higher, that would become your new high score for that stage. Reaching a certain total score will grant you an opportunity to claim the event-exclusive namecard "Celebration: Battlesong" and other rewards.

After the event ends, all points will be cleared and no further rewards can be claimed. Don't forget to claim your rewards in time!
