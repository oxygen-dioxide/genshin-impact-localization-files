<!-- Misc. gameplay things (will add to page proper later): Yellow slimes are worth 100 points, blue slimes are worth 200 points, and double green slimes are worth 100 points. Despite appearances, You don't need to start charging swings at the signposts, so long as a swing it charged, it'll work. Also, green slimes are treated like singular notes. Hitting one at once won't work, and hitting both gives 1 combo and 100 points. -->
