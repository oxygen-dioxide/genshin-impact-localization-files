==Trivia==
* As to his name, each of its characters ''per se'' has positive meanings: {{Lang|"will, determination, and ambition"|zh=志|zh_rm=zhì}} and {{Lang|"splendor, brilliance, fame, and beauty"|zh=华|zh_rm=huá}}. However, the combination of these characters may imply he is merely seeking vanity,<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv8715157/ {{Lang|zh=【原神】璃月里的名字考据|mini=1}}]</ref> and it is the opposite of the Confucian virtue {{Lang|''zhixue''|zh={{wt|志學|志学}}|zh_rm=zhìxué|zh_tl=to devote oneself to the pursuit of learning}}. Note that the name of [[Qiming]], a fortune-teller on whom he has a crush, likely means "beautiful destiny".
* He shares his English VA Alejandro Saab with [[Cyno]].
