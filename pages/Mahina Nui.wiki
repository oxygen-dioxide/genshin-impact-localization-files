{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mahina Nui:''' Hello, and welcome! If you need anything, just let me know.
:{{DIcon}} Any recommendations?
::'''Mahina Nui:''' A chilled drink. I made it myself!
::'''Mahina Nui:''' We don't have as many varieties as the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], but it's still refreshing and cool.
::'''Mahina Nui:''' See those folks over there? We've got so many people in the hot springs, their faces are always flushed when they finally step out of the pool.
::'''Mahina Nui:''' A glass of iced milk or a mint drink would hit just the spot!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Wouldn't be bad to drink it on a regular basis, either.
:::'''Mahina Nui:''' Ah, yeah, good point!
:::'''Mahina Nui:''' It's always sweltering around these parts, so people get dizzy fast &mdash; and that's where the [[Mint]] comes in as a pep-me-up!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Berry & Mint Burst|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} I don't need anything at the moment.
::'''Mahina Nui:''' Anyway, please hit me up if you ever want something cold!
