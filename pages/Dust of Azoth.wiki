==Trivia==
* The word {{wt|azoth}} is derived from Arabic {{Lang|az-zūq|ar=الزوق}}, meaning quicksilver or mercury. In the medieval ages, azoth was believed to be a universal substance in alchemy that was sought after for its chemical properties.
* {{Lang|Dust of Azoth|zh=嬗变之尘|ja=変転の塵|sort=zh,ja}} is also translated as "conversion dust" in Chinese and Japanese.
