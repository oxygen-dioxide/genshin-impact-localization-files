==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Ying'er is a shop assistant for the Scent of Spring at [[Liyue Harbor|Chihu Rock]], a shop for fine vases. She also makes perfumes as a side job.

During the events of [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]], [[Zhongli]] tasked the [[Traveler]] with converting the flowers he had bought from [[Bolai]] into perfume as part of the [[Rite of Parting]] over [[Morax]]'s death. The Traveler found Ying'er and she helped them create the needed perfume, taking them through step by step.

Later on, [[Timaeus]] discovered a "Smoldersleet Elixir" and with the Traveler's help, tracked its origins to Ying'er, who told them that it was just a popular perfume. Ying'er offered to teach him how to make perfume, seeing that it could help him out with his alchemical work. With her guidance, Timaeus was able to make an improved agent and the two began talking about essential oils and perfumes while the Traveler tested Timaeus' new potion.

===Personality===
Ying'er has a romantic personality and a soft voice. She uses a lot of double entendres while speaking, causing the Traveler to mistake the Scent of Spring for a brothel before realizing she was talking about porcelain. She is also an effective teacher as she gives step-by-step instructions to both the Traveler and Timaeus during their respective procedures.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Prior to completing [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]])
:'''Ying'er:''' Well hello, you're looking rather fetching today. Care to take a look inside Scent of Spring? I'm sure you'll find something unforgettable~!

;(After completing [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]])
:'''Ying'er:''' Well hello there, stranger... Did you come all this way just to see me?
:'''Ying'er:''' Shame &mdash; this girl's still got to work. If only it were after hours...
:'''Ying'er:''' Why don't you come feast your eyes on what we've got in store? I'm just a slab of lipstick and a dab of makeup compared to these beauties.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, is this a...
::'''Ying'er:''' Of course! As you would expect. The real deal.
::'''Ying'er:''' You didn't know? They let us open our own little hideaways, nothing to worry about.
::'''Ying'er:''' Just imagine, the warmth of their bodies, the smoothness of their curves under your hands...
::'''Ying'er:''' Pretty as they are, you can't have them out and about, it's not appropriate. I have to get them baked for twelve hours before I can even open shop...
::{{DIcon}} Wait, did you just say "baked"?
::'''Ying'er:''' Of course! I mean, not as intensely as those other places, but once I've got them ready, they're just as good as anywhere else.
::'''Ying'er:''' All our very best are as I described: full and elegant bodies, thinner up top, but curvaceous further down. It's what everybody is asking for these days...
::'''Ying'er:''' The clients that I have come and pick their favorite and then off they go! They're always so glowing and satisfied when they're done.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, ahh, I'll... I'll pass.
::'''Ying'er:''' Oh come now, why so stuffy? No one likes someone who can't appreciate and enjoy true beauty!

::'''Ying'er:''' Oh my~ If it isn't my old acquaintance. Did you come all this way during Lantern Rite to see me?
::'''Ying'er:'''  Of course, you look as lovely as ever.
::'''Ying'er:'''  It's just a shame that we're so busy, even though it's the festival period...
::'''Ying'er:''' But either way, why don't you feast your eyes on what we've got in store? Who knows, you might chance upon some extra benefits.
::'''Ying'er:'''  I mean, I'm just a slap of lipstick and a dab of makeup compared to these beauties.

==Trivia==
* In modern Mandarin Chinese, {{Lang|''yīng''|zh=莺}} primarily refers to {{w|warbler}}s, potentially influenced by the Japanese word {{Lang|''uguisu''|ja=鶯|ja_tl={{w|Japanese bush warbler}}}}, whose kanji derives from the traditional form of ''yīng''.<ref name="sibagu">Sibagu: [http://sibagu.com/notes/orioles.html Of Orioles and Warblers]</ref> However, in pre-modern times, ''yīng'' solely signified {{w|Old World oriole|orioles}}, specifically the {{w|black-naped oriole}}.<ref name="sibagu" />
** The black-naped oriole is an important bird and a popular theme in traditional Chinese literature due to its beautiful song and role as a harbinger of spring.<ref name="sibagu" />
* Her name could be inspired by the character also by the name of {{Lang|Ying'er|zh=莺儿}} from the romantic fiction ''{{w|Dream of the Red Chamber}}'', one of the Four Greatest Classical Novels of China.
** For the character in the novel, Ying'er ("Little Oriole") is a diminutive of her true name {{Lang|mini=1|zh=黄金莺|zh_rm=Huángjīn Yīng|zh_tl=Golden Oriole}}.<ref>Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%8E%BA%E5%84%BF {{zh|莺儿}}]</ref>
* The Chinese name for Scent of Spring is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=春香窑|zh_rm=Chūnxiāng-yáo|zh_tl=Spring-Scent Kiln}}. It matches China's cultural idea that a black-naped oriole (''yīng'') is an elegant harbinger of spring. {{Lang|"Kiln"|zh=窑|zh_rm=yáo}} is also a common suffix for orthodox porcelain producers, such as the {{Lang|{{w|Jingdezhen porcelain|Jingdezhen}}-yao|zh=景德镇窑}}.
* There are many double-entendres associated with Ying'er.
** In {{Lang|Scent of Spring|zh=春香窑|zh_rm=Chūnxiāng-yáo}}, {{Lang|spring|zh=春|zh_rm=chūn}} may connote amorous or lustful feelings.<ref>Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%98%A5/22241 {{zh|春 (汉字)}}]</ref> Also, {{Lang|kiln|zh=窑|zh_rm=yáo}} is colloquially used to refer to brothels.<ref>Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%AA%91 {{zh|窑}}]</ref>
** The term {{Lang|mini=1|zh=流莺|zh_rm=liúyīng}} (lit. "wandering warbler/oriole") is a euphemistic way of referring to a {{w|streetwalker}}.
** These may explain why the Traveler was confused about Ying'er's behaviors.
* She is one of the few people from Liyue whose Japanese name is read using the ''{{w|kun'yomi}}'' instead of the ''{{w|on'yomi}}.''
* Ying'er is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Red Cedar Curio Stand]]."
