'''Movement Speed''', abbreviated as '''Movement SPD''' in in-game descriptions is a modifier that alters the speed of a character. It affects a character's animation speed while walking, running, [[sprinting]], dashing, jumping, or using alternative means of movement such as [[Alternate Sprint]]s, [[Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash|Sayu's Elemental Skill]] and [[Lingering Lifeline|Yelan's Elemental Skill]].

Movement Speed bonuses come from both characters and weapons and can be triggered by a variety of effects.
*The {{Anemo}} [[Elemental Resonance]] can increase Movement SPD by 10%.
