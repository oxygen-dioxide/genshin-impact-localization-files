==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''[[Canticles of Harmony]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Este:''' I'm counting on you, then. *sigh* How could something like this happen...
:'''Este:''' I can't just leave everyone else in town to fend for themselves, or I'd be up a gander back to the ruins to investigate... Still, it's a good thing I ran into you!
:'''Este:''' Please be extra careful.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''[[Canticles of Harmony]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Este:''' Hello. We meet again. To be honest, seeing you once more makes me wonder if I'm still in a dream...
:{{DIcon}} What have you been busy with lately?
::'''Este:''' Since that incident, I've discovered that hypnosis is indeed a most promising research direction. 
::'''Este:''' Just think about it! In a dream, all your fantasies could easily come true, could they not?
::'''Este:''' As such, I've read the notes [[Grispan]] left behind. I'm not sure I'll do better than him, but I can at least add to the field. 
::'''Este:''' He's sure to be impressed when he returns!
:{{DIcon}} Is [[Osse]] doing well?
::'''Este:''' Most definitely. Despite his tender age, he's a brave little kitty. Shockingly bold, even. 
::'''Este:''' He's utterly unafraid of strangers. I'm sure he'd get along with everyone in town smashingly. 
:{{DIcon}} See you next time! 
::'''Este:''' See you. Do come around and see Osse more often. I'm sure he misses you. 
{{Dialogue End}}

== Trivia ==
* Este is presumably less affected by the dysphoric [[Symphony]] due to his Remurian descendancy via [[Este (Golem)|his ancestor of the same name]]. 
===Etymology===
* The name Este is a reference to European dynasty of North Italian origin {{w|House of Este}}.
