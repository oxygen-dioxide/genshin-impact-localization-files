'''The Tree who Stands Alone''' is a [[World Quest]] that occurs in [[Liyue]].
==Steps==
Start the quest by talking to [[Yuan Hong]] in [[Mingyun Village]].
#Look around Mingyun Village
##Go to the house facing the billboard (Image in Gallery) and read the "Lost Notes".

It is required to read the notes as the first step, as it triggers the spawning of the four parts of the fathers will and the matching four markers on the map. If you don't read the notes at first, you have to go all the ways twice or more.
#Look for a will (0/4) (Map in Gallery)
##The will to the '''south''' is in a cave, guarded by a hilichurl standing in front of an explosive barrel.
###Noctilucous Jade can be mined.
##The will to the '''east''' is in a cave, with three hilichurls outside the entrance. If you already unlocked the nearby Exquisite Chest they were guarding, no hilichurls will appear.
###White Iron Chunk, Noctilucous Jade, and Cor Lapis can be mined. An Exquisite Chest can be opened.
##The will to the '''north''' is in a cave, with a hilichurl and three Geo slimes inside. You can skip this battle by swimming past them.
###Iron Chunk, White Iron Chunk, and Noctilucous Jade can be mined.
##The will to the '''west''' is in a cave with two entrances. The southern entrance has three Electro Cicins guarding an Exquisite Chest. The northern entrance has a Blazing Axe Mitachurl and three hilichurls guarding an Exquisite Chest. If you already unlocked these chests, no enemies will appear.
###Iron Chunk, White Iron Chunk, Cor Lapis, and Noctilucous Jade can be mined. A Geoculus can be collected.
#Find the treasure (Map in Gallery)
##The treasure is at the base of a large tree. (Image in Gallery) When you approach the tree, four Treasure Hoarders will spawn.
#Collect the treasure
##A dig option becomes available at the base of the tree.
##After digging, a Precious Chest will spawn.

==Notes==
* Upon quest completion, this quest grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Trees Should Blend Their Roots and Shade, for That Is Where the Home Is Made]]."

{{Quest Description|In Mingyun Village you discover a very strangely written will...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Entering Mingyun Village)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... That village up ahead seems kinda spooky...
:'''Paimon:''' D–Do we have to go in? Maybe there's a way around...?
----
;(Talking to Yuan Hong)
:'''Yuan Hong:''' The tree who stands alone has no forest to call his home...
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:'''Yuan Hong:''' The splendid red autumnal leaves, parted ways though there be no breeze...
:{{DIcon}} Hello! Excuse me!
:'''Yuan Hong:''' The glorious red autumnal leaves, parted ways on a passing breeze...
:'''Paimon:''' Why are they ignoring us?
:'''Yuan Hong:''' Money... riches... It's all a farce. A farce, I say!
:'''Yuan Hong:''' The further away from this village... the better...
:'''Yuan Hong:''' If only we could start all over again... From the beginning...
----
;(Reading the Lost Notes)
:'''Exhortations of a dying man:''' "...The tree who stands alone has no forest to call his home... But the sturdy rock has a heart of gold, unite and you shall share in its blessings... This fortune hereby made known unto you, I say: honor the will of your father..."
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, isn't the first half of this what that old guy was saying?
:'''Paimon:''' "The sturdy rock has a heart of gold, unite and you shall share in its blessings..." So the gold and silver is inside a rock?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... If that's the case, we should check in the mine. But, um, there seems to be way more than one mine in this area...
:'''Paimon:''' We'll just have to check each one in turn. There's no other way.
----
;(Investigating the scroll at the south mine)
:'''Yuan Cheng:''' Hmph, lousy older brothers! All they care about is taking the best finds for themselves.
:'''Yuan Cheng:''' And dad's losing it in his old age... either completely oblivious, or just happy to turn a blind eye...
:'''Yuan Cheng:''' I don't think they've realized yet that the treasure's in the mine.
:'''Yuan Cheng:''' I've gotta get my hands on it... and then get as far away from here as possible!
----
;(Investigating the scroll at the east mine)
:'''Yuan Qing:''' Oh no! What did I do to deserve this...
:'''Yuan Qing:''' I finally managed to slip away while they weren't watching so that I could be first to get to the mine and find the treasure... But where did all these monsters come from!?
:'''Yuan Qing:''' I'm done for...
----
;(Investigating the scroll at the north mine)
:'''Yuan Liang:''' Hehehe... The treasure will be mine!
:'''Yuan Liang:''' My brothers are such morons... They ran off after grasping a couple of lines thinking they'd figured it out. Hehehe...
:'''Yuan Liang:''' Honor father's will? Bah! There was one line worth reading in that thing, and that was the part about the treasure being in the mine. Speaking of mine... Soon it will all be mine! Hehehe...
----
;(Investigating the scroll at the west mine)
:'''Yuan Hong:''' They've left... They've all left...
:'''Yuan Hong:''' Yuan Qing, Yuan Liang, Yuan Cheng... You foolish children. You'll have to think a bit more carefully and look harder than you are doing now...
----
;(After looking at each of the four mines)
:'''Paimon:''' Let's look out for any trees that stand out around here, then.
;(When approaching the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go and look for clues.
;(Near the tree)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, behind you! It's the Treasure Hoarders!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh. We seem to run into these guys every single time there's treasure involved...
----
;(Upon digging up the Precious Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, look! It's those guys from earlier.
:'''Yuan Qing:''' The tree who stands alone has no forest to call his home... Haha, it's true, you can't achieve anything by yourself...
:'''Yuan Cheng:''' The splendid red autumnal leaves, part ways though there be no breeze... If I could take my brothers and father at their word...
:'''Yuan Liang:''' The glorious red autumnal leaves, part ways on a passing breeze... The treasure... Lost everything, all because of the treasure...
:'''Yuan Hong:''' Trees should blend their roots and shade, for that is where the home is made... Children, we're supposed to be a family...
:'''Yuan Hong:''' You seriously thought I hid treasure in the mine? ... *sigh*
:'''Yuan Hong:''' There is a treasure, though... Do you still remember the tree we planted together as a family when you were children?
:'''Yuan Hong:''' I come here every year and put a little something inside, hoping that when you're older we can dig it out together.
:'''Yuan Hong:''' And then use it to buy some treats and a bottle of wine... celebrate together, as a family... talk about the old times...
:'''Yuan Hong:''' Oh children, my dear children...
----
;(Afterwards)
:'''Paimon:''' ...Is this that old man's treasure?
:'''Paimon:''' If they could come back here many years from now, dig out this treasure, and talk about the old days together, Paimon bets they'd be so happy.
:'''Paimon:''' But the way things are now... they'll never be able to be a family again, or look back on happy memories of the past...
:'''Paimon:''' We won't ever leave each other though, right? We've still got a long journey ahead of us, we'll be together for a looooong time yet...
:'''Paimon:''' When we find your family, we should get all our friends together and share all our stories.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes that day isn't too far away...
