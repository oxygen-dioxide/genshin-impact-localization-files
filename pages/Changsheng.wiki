{{Lang|'''Changsheng'''|zh=长生|zh_rm=Chángshēng|zh_tl=Longevity}} is [[Baizhu]]'s pet snake, often seen wrapped around his neck. She first appears in the quest ''[[Guizhong (Archon Quest)|Guizhong]]''.

==Profile==
===Personality===
Changsheng is a clever but blunt snake who frequently insults those around her. She describes [[Qiqi]] as a "simpleton" and calls [[Paimon]] a mascot. Despite this, Changsheng seems to care about the safety of those around her, advising that the [[Traveler]] and Paimon not to trust [[Childe]].

She is also terrified of [[Xinyan]] due to her sensitivity to vibrations; after their first encounter, in which she fainted from listening to her music, whenever Xinyan comes to meet Baizhu for medications, she instinctively ducks up his sleeve.

===Appearance===
Changsheng is a white snake with red eyes. She has round pupils as opposed to slitted ones (which could mean that she is diurnal). She is often seen wrapped around Baizhu's neck.
