==Descriptions==
{{Description|The toy shop run by Granny Shan. No matter the time or situation, people always want to enjoy themselves. Perhaps it is this sentiment that has led her to continue manning this nameless little store year after year. Apart from spinning tops, wooden swords, kites, and other knick-knacks, you can also sometimes find some rarer toys here...|[[Map]] description}}
