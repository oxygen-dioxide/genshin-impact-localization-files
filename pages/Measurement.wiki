'''Measurement''' refers to the quantification of physical features such as length, [[time]], and mass within Genshin Impact.

The unit of measurement for distances is meters, abbreviated as ''m'' in-game. The world of [[Teyvat]] appears to take place in 3-dimensional Euclidean space (flat space).

==Mass==
All playable characters so far have a mass of 10 (units unspecified).<ref name="poise" group="Note">See [[Interruption Resistance/Data]] and references therein</ref>

In real life, mass can be used to compute the [[weight]] of objects under the influence of [[gravity]]. However, within the game, it appears that for various entities (such as enemies), the mass and weight are considered as separate, independent quantities. Moreover, within the game, even the acceleration due to gravity can vary for different entities.<ref name="poise" group="Note" /><ref group="Note">Also see [[Weight]] data</ref>

==Character Heights==
The values are taken from in-game measurements based on in game scale, rounded to the nearest 0.1 centimeter.<ref name="poise" group="Note" />

Note that all characters use one of a limited number of character models in-game (tall, medium, and short for male and female, though no short male characters exist yet). These measurements are for their in-game models.<!--

==Area of Effect==
{{Main|Area of Effect|Vacuum Field}}
Numerous [[Area of Effect]] skills have a measurable radius. These data are detailed in the above articles.

==Time==
{{Main|Time}}
[[Time]] is measured in seconds. Time passes faster in Teyvat than in the real world.

==Trivia==
The tallest playable characters in the game are:
# Arataki Itto (193.4&nbsp;cm)
# Zhongli (188.9&nbsp;cm)
# Tartaglia (188.8&nbsp;cm)
# Ayato (188.4&nbsp;cm)
# Thoma (187.5&nbsp;cm)
The first and second place have a fairly large margin of 4.5&nbsp;cm, but the second to fifth place only have a margin of 1.4&nbsp;cm.

According to a [https://twitter.com/guerrilla/status/818780529709477888?lang=en tweet] from the developers of ''Horizon Zero Dawn'', Aloy is canonically 168&nbsp;cm tall, but (unless the in game scale is inaccurate to the intended heights) was shrunken down due to using the medium model. It is unknown whether the rest of the characters' canon heights can be determined from this measurement, but if so, characters will likely have a 6–10&nbsp;cm increase.

These heights are based off the character's default skins and may vary between skins.

Beidou has been described as 6&nbsp;ft tall in Tea Master Liu Su's story, but this (unless Aloy's height intended to be accurate) is likely an exaggeration.

Heights listed from models include shoes and hair due to their being no reliable way of getting all characters heights without them. Another thing to note is that most female characters and some male characters wear height extending shoes (Yoimiya, Xingqiu, Heizou, Itto, all tall female characters, etc.). This could lead up to a 5–12&nbsp;cm decrease in height for the characters with high shoes. However, it does appear that accessories such as hats are omitted.
