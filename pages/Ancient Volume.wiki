==Text==
"When demons sought the world in shadow to submerge, in time of need the Khvarena did emerge.<br>
From the plane of light eternal, down to the darkness of death infernal.<br>
The living deity first let the waters of Amrita flow, the merciful god replanted the tree of life to grow.<br>
From two were Khvarena's children birthed, by holy three was all life delivered.<br>
All knowledge from its flowers blooms,<br>
All good spirits from its fruit are seeded.<br>
Five kinds of songbirds by it be nourished, five kinds of poison roots by it be purged.<br>
By it do we escape delusions and achieve purity, here we shall be its guardians in perpetuity.<br>
Unto the magnificent eternal tree all our praises render, without equal is its glorious splendor!"
