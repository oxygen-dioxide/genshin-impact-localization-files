{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Mt. Tianheng'''|zh=天衡山|zh_rm=Tiānhéng-shān}}|description=<p></p>}}

Despite the map displaying the name "Mt. Tianheng" over the peaks west of [[Liyue Harbor]], the mountain range north of the Harbor through which passes the road leading to [[Guili Plains]] is also part of Mt. Tianheng, as the author of ''[[Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I]]'' says that [[Morax]] lead his people south of Mt. Tianheng to found Liyue Harbor, therefore placing Mt. Tianheng north of the city.

==Puzzles==
===Anemo Monument Puzzle===
Near the Teleport Waypoint south of [[Guili Plains]] exists a puzzle that involves two Anemo Monuments and a [[Pressure Plate]]. Activating both [[Anemo Monument]]s before they deactivate spawns a [[Chests|Precious Chest]].

One monument is located on the upper floor of the ruin, while another is located underneath. The pressure plate opens a gate that allows players to quickly move between floors. It is possible to complete this puzzle in Co-Op Mode or, for solo players, use a character whose construct can activate large sensors ([[Pressure Plate#Activating Large Sensors|see list]]), run upstairs, activate the Anemo Monument, jump down from the opening in the floor, and activate the lower Monument.

===Geo Monument Puzzle===
Southeast of the ruin are six [[Geo Monument]]s arranged in a circle, five of them surrounding one more in the center. Activate the monuments according to the spiral of flowers surrounding the area. When this happens, an [[Eye of the Storm]] will spawn and attack the player. Defeating the monster will spawn a precious chest.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|The pride of the mountain range that shelters Liyue Harbor from the west, acting as a natural shield against any enemies that may come that way.<br />There are uncountable records of wars both big and small whereby enemies have been blocked by this barrier. As such you can still see ancient ruins of city walls, forts, and defensive structures.<br />Liyue's earliest mining operations are also believed to have started in this area.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}

==Lore==
[[Morax]] raised Mt. Tianheng when he first descended upon Liyue, and there people congregated to mine ore from the mountains. These people then established {{Lang|Shanhui Fort|zh=山辉砦}}. [[Guizhong]] and her people would eventually move to the [[Guili Plains|plains]] north of Mt. Tianheng, allying with Morax<ref>{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref> and [[Marchosius]] to create the [[Guili Assembly]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go}}</ref> Guizhong and some [[adepti]] built the [[Guizhong Ballista]] to defend Tianheng Pass from external threats.

It is said that during the [[Archon War]], a clash between Morax and another [[god]] nearly toppled Mt. Tianheng. The adeptus [[Skybracer]] sacrificed his antlers &mdash; bestowed on him by Morax's power and containing divine power &mdash; to prop up the mountain, making it even taller than before, then continued to fight until he died of blood loss and exhaustion.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Madame Ping|c=during [[Lantern Rite]]}}</ref>

==Trivia==
===Developer Insight===
'''[https://youtu.be/mfUSO0DlAwc "Travels Afar" Scenic Spot Collaboration Documentary - Zhangjiajie Chapter]'''

'''Yan Jiang, Level Artist:''' The sole path to Liyue Harbor is the entrance of Mt. Tianheng, which was inspired by {{w|Tianmen Mountain}}. Therefore, there is a certain sense of ceremony while you make your way up there. After entering Mt. Tianheng, you unexpectedly find yourself in the trade capital that is Liyue Harbor; such a strong visual and spatial contrast allows Liyue's rich natural and man-made elements to stand out even more.
