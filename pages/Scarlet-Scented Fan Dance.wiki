|description    = A water plant that can sometimes be found in shallow seas. It resembles a folding fan, and its pinkish-red color remains exceedingly rich even after it has been dried, much like the flowing locks of the [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|Divine Priestess]]. As such, some Watatsumi islanders and soldiers almost worship these plants and give them a wide berth. The Divine Priestess herself, however, personally considers such beliefs to be completely unnecessary.
