==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Decembre is found in the [[Fortress of Meropide]]. He asks the Traveler to help send a birthday letter to his son on the surface. He had been unlucky before with waiting in the mail line. However, it turns out the letter sent to the surface was somebody else's letter.

Later it is revealed that Decembre asks newcomers to help do assignments. He pays them in [[Credit Coupons]] and pockets a portion of the commission fee income. [[Maupoil]] sent him to solitary confinement as he attempted to defraud the Traveler and Paimon again.
