{{Description|A prosperous commercial port across the sea from Fontaine. Business is booming as people and goods come and go.|[[Loading Screen]]}}
{{Description|Most believe that the "Yilong" here refers to "the jade left behind," but some scholars also hold that "Yilong" was once a result of miscopying of the word "dragon remnants," referring to the perilous nature of the mountains, something that has nothing to do with jade at all.|[[Loading Screen]]}}

==Lore==
The artisans of Yilong Wharf still make simple jade ornaments like the [[Symbol of Felicitation]].

The people of [[Chenyu Vale]] have a ceremony of going to Yilong Wharf to worship their ancestors and the dead. They also had a tradition of tossing jade into the water. This tradition continued even after the ancient god who ruled over the vale perished and [[Morax]] arrived.<ref name='sj'>{{Ref/Weapon|Sacrificial Jade}}</ref>

Yilong jade is known for its blue-green color and shine. To this day, it can still be found in ruins, mountains, and valleys of Liyue.<ref name='sj' />
