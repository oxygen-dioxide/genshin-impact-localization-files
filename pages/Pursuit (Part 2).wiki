{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with the Book of Revealing)
:'''Book of Revealing:''' (The content on the pages still consists of incomprehensible symbols, letters, ancient languages, and geometric figures. But a period of focus seems to gradually render their meaning comprehensible.)
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, are you still going to meditate?
:{{DIcon}} We haven't found Canotila yet.
::{{DIcon}} I'm going to need you to give me another moment, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Okay then! It's just a blink of an eye anyway. Paimon's not worried at all!
:'''Paimon:''' Still, be careful, {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Don't worry.
::'''Book of Revealing:''' (The edges of the pages blur gradually. A profoundly unfamiliar yet familiar world enters your field of vision. Here...)
:;(Enter [[??? (Fontaine)|???]])
:{{DIcon}} Let me get ready first.
::'''Paimon:''' Okay!

;(Interact with the Book of Revealing, if "let me prepare" was chosen)
:'''Book of Revealing:''' (The content on the pages still consists of incomprehensible symbols, letters, ancient languages, and geometric figures. But a period of focus seems to gradually render their meaning comprehensible.)
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, are you ready? Paimon will wait here for you!
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Alright.
::'''Book of Revealing:''' (The edges of the pages blur gradually. A profoundly unfamiliar yet familiar world enters your field of vision. Here...)
:{{DIcon}} Not right now.
::'''Book of Revealing:''' ...

;(Enter ???)
:'''Traveler:''' ...

;(Talk to Canotila at the starting location)
:'''Canotila:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}? Didn't we just see each other?
:{{DIcon}} When did we last meet?
:'''Canotila:''' Hmm, I'm not sure. After all, it's hard to keep track of time in a place like this.
:{{DIcon}} Come with me, Canotila.
::{{DIcon}} Something about this place doesn't feel right.
:'''Canotila:''' Hmm, but don't we get to decide what feels right or not?
:'''Canotila:''' Um, I didn't mean to be so deep. But I really like this place. It's full of life and colors, things I've never seen on the other side.
:{{DIcon}} I only saw a sunflower...
:'''Canotila:''' Really? Wow! Where?
:{{DIcon}} Where we saw the puppy.
:'''Canotila:''' Okay! I'm going there now!
:{{DIcon}} Wait...

;(Talk to Canotila on the floating rubble to the right of the staring location, optional)
:'''Canotila:''' *sob*
:{{DIcon}} Canotila...
:'''Canotila:''' Huh? {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}... Who are you? I thought no one could get in here besides me.
:'''Canotila:''' Wait, how do you know my name?
:{{DIcon}} We know each other.
::'''Canotila:''' Liar! You must be just like those monsters...
:{{DIcon}} (Lie) Serene sent me to find you.
::'''Canotila:''' Oh... Always making her worry like this, I'm such a bad child...
::{{DIcon}} I'm {{Traveler}}. Do you still remember me?
::'''Canotila:''' Right, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}... I remember now... Even though you're a giant monster who could swallow the world in one gulp, you are very kind.
::{{DIcon}} Heh, how rude.
:::{{DIcon}} What's happened?
::{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:::{{DIcon}} What's happened?
::'''Canotila:''' I saw a few people, but then they slowly melted and turned into monsters...
::'''Canotila:''' Uh, that's kinda scary.

;(Talk to Canotila on the floating rubble to the left of the staring location, optional)
:'''Canotila:''' I see: The flames on the throne have been extinguished, and the burnt ashes have once again turned into trees.
:'''Canotila:''' Flowers bloom with your every step, bringing change to an otherwise inevitable decay in the future.
:{{DIcon}} Canotila?
:'''Canotila:''' Huh? {{sic|it's}} {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}! What brings you here?
:'''Canotila:''' Um, right! The golden butterfly has returned. I need to go and see it! Goodbye!

;(Talk to Canotila on the floating bridge in front of the staring location, optional)
:'''Canotila:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Canotila?
:'''Canotila:''' Huh? You're finally back! I was so worried. I don't know what I would've done if you never came back...
:'''Canotila:''' After you went inside, I waited outside for a very, very long time. I even tried to get help from the other Melusines, but no one knew what to do...
:{{DIcon}} (It seems like I've been here for quite a while, then.)
::{{DIcon}} Well, I've got to go.
:'''Canotila:''' What? {{Traveler}}, where are you going...
:{{DIcon}}Don't worry. I'll come back once I find you, Canotila.
::{{DIcon}} Just wait for me a little longer, okay?
:::{{DIcon}} I know that saying this to you won't change much.
::::{{DIcon}} But still, trust me.
::::{{DIcon}} Don't worry.
:'''Canotila:''' {{Traveler}}...

;(Talk to Canotila on the floating bridge above the previous location, optional)
:'''Canotila:''' Since memories can be made into a book, if we reverse that logic, the contents of the book can also be written directly into memories...
:{{DIcon}} Canotila?
:'''Canotila:''' Ah, it's you, the strange {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}. What is it? Do you need something from me? 
:{{DIcon}} What were you talking about...
:'''Canotila:''' Hmm. No matter how I think about this, converting memories into a book is quite an incredible deed...
:'''Canotila:''' The creator of this book must've only been able to do this because they viewed the emotions in their {{Rubi|memories|delusions}} as the most precious thing in the world.
:'''Canotila:''' That doesn't change how difficult it is to read, though...
:'''Canotila:''' ..And I'm not sure what kind of impact it will have on its readers. This is quite...

;(Approach Caterpillar under the floating bridge, defeat the Anemo Hilichurl Rogue, then talk to Canotila in front of the rift)
:'''Canotila:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}! Wait, why isn't Paimon with you?
:{{DIcon}} That rift... What are you looking at?
:'''Canotila:''' What rift? Isn't this a mirror?
:'''Canotila:''' Well, speaking of that, there is something that I've been looking for.
:'''Canotila:''' I'm trying to find clues to the Looking Glass. It looks like a painting, and lets people meditate in a similar manner to the Book of Revealing.
:{{DIcon}} About the four orthants and the painting in the Tower of Gestalt...
:'''Canotila:''' ...Really? So it's in a place like that? Okay! Thank you, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}.

;(Approach Caterpillar and once the Anemo Hilichurl Rogue is at 50% HP or less)
:'''Canotila:''' Argh... Please, help...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It's coming from over there. Gotta be quick.)

;(Approach Canotila on a floating platform high above)
:'''Canotila:''' Here {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, help me!

;(Approach Caterpillar and after defeating the Anemo Hilichurl Rogue)
:'''Canotila:''' Thanks, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:'''Canotila:''' I don't know. I just wanted to see the blooming sunflowers and the cute puppy...
:'''Canotila:''' But a monster came after me, and the sky got darker. I heard many voices talking about things that I didn't understand.
:'''Canotila:''' I was scared, so I followed the golden light and ran forward.
:'''Canotila:''' The world got a little darker whenever the monster came near. The garden, the palace, the great trees, and the flowers all disappeared. It was very gloomy, and I only saw ruins...
:'''Canotila:''' And then the monster caught up to me...
:{{DIcon}} You don't have to worry now.
::{{DIcon}} Puppy, please send her back.
:'''Puppy:''' Don't come around here anymore, little one. There's nothing here, but there's a whole world waiting for you out there.
:'''Canotila:''' Huh? Are you the puppy? But...
:'''Canotila:''' ...Will I see you again? Will this world become a beautiful garden again?
:'''Puppy:''' No. Goodbye.
:'''Puppy:''' And you, let me ask you one more time. What am I in your eyes?
:{{DIcon}} A dog.
:'''Puppy:''' That's good. You just got rid of someone who shouldn't be here, and thanks to you, this world's collapse has stopped.
:'''Puppy:''' But it is unwise for any of you to stay all the same.
:{{DIcon}} I figured as much. Please send me back.
::'''Puppy:''' A wise choice. Farewell.
:{{DIcon}} What's going on?
::'''Puppy:''' This world was going to disintegrate, because someone who shouldn't be here arrived, shaking the foundations of this world.
::{{DIcon}} Is that why I saw what I saw?
::'''Puppy:''' I don't know what you experienced. I am not you, after all.
::{{DIcon}} And who are you then?
::'''Puppy:''' ...That is not important. What's important is the masters of this imaginary world.
::'''Puppy:''' They believed that they could save the world, but they didn't know if this world actually needed to be saved. Maybe the world in their memories was but an afternoon forever bereft of blooming sunflowers.
::'''Puppy:''' But those are their stories and not mine. I'm just a memory that they have of their friend. They once believed that they could save me, but ultimately...
::'''Puppy:''' The butterfly became a cocoon, and a larva emerged from the cocoon. Then, the larva returned to the void that was never born.
::'''Puppy:''' But none of these things matter. I have nothing left. I am just a shadow in their memories, left behind by their obsession to save me.
::'''Puppy:''' I don't hate them, though. Even if they changed after losing me, my existence in this world of memories and delusions is proof of their persistence.
::'''Puppy:''' As someone who was once their friend, I am more than satisfied. No matter what I become, I am forever grateful for the friendship we once had.
::'''Puppy:''' Anyway, let's end it here. You can feel the influence this place has on you, can't you?
::'''Puppy:''' Farewell. We won't see each other again.

;(After entering the rift on the same platform)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, I...
:'''Paimon:''' That was super fast! Paimon didn't even have time to blink...
:{{DIcon}} ...That's a relief.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! Our little troublemaker's back! Canotila, you made {{Traveler}} really worried, you know?
:'''Canotila:''' I...
:'''Canotila:''' *sob* I'm sorry...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon's not blaming you! Don't cry, Canotila. Come on, Paimon will give you something delicious to eat...
:'''Paimon:''' (What happened?)
:{{DIcon}} (We encountered some danger inside.)
:'''Paimon:''' (Oh...)
:'''Paimon:''' Don't cry, Canotila, you're a brave, brave Melusine! Here, this is Paimon's favorite Chicken-Mushroom Skewer. Take it, it's all yours!
:'''Canotila:''' *sob* Thank you so much, Paimon...
:'''Canotila:''' *chewing*
:'''Canotila:''' Whoa, such a strange taste! So this is what humans eat for their meals...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! If you don't want it, you can just give it back to Paimon!
:'''Canotila:''' But... Thank you. And thank you for saving me, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}!
:{{DIcon}} What do you plan to do next?
:'''Canotila:''' I don't know, but I don't want to read books anymore.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Canotila, isn't that a bit extreme?
:'''Canotila:''' Well, um... The Book of Revealing is really scary...
:'''Paimon:''' (So, what exactly happened?)
:{{DIcon}} (It's a long story...)
::{{DIcon}} (You'd only understand if you were there.)
::{{DIcon}} (It's a good thing you didn't go.)
:'''Paimon:''' (What do you mean? Ugh, Paimon's getting annoyed...)
:'''Canotila:''' ...Anyway, I don't want to stay here anymore. I want to live with everyone in Merusea Village.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! The other Melusines will take good care of you!
:'''Canotila:''' Thank you, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Paimon.
