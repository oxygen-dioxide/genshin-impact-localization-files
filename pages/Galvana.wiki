==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Galvana:''' Huh? Is something wrong?
:{{DIcon|Reward}} There's someone who looks just like you...
::'''Galvana:''' You've met [[Galvaryet]]? She's my younger sister. We're twins. *ahem* She's too old to keep calling me Sis all the time...
::'''Galvana:''' Oh, please don't take it the wrong way. I don't dislike her at all, it's just... This is our workplace, and we should be more serious when it's work hours!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Order|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} About the Rift of Erosion...
::'''Galvana:''' Hmm. Yes, it is definitely a potential danger. Would you also agree it would be better to seal it off?
::{{DIcon}} That's not what I said.
:::'''Galvana:''' Hmm. Now that I think about it, it's not that small a space. It would be great if we could put it to good use...
::{{DIcon}} I'm in favor of sealing up all entrances and exits.
:::'''Galvana:''' Seal up all the entrances and exits? That's a little extreme... I never thought you would advocate doing something like that. You really can't judge a book by its cover...
:{{DIcon}} About the searchlights...
::'''Galvana:''' The searchlights seem to break frequently. It might be because of the energy storage devices installed inside them.
::'''Galvana:''' Or maybe they break so often because people don't follow the instructions when they use them?
:{{DIcon}} Nothing.
::'''Galvana:''' That's good then. Bye.
