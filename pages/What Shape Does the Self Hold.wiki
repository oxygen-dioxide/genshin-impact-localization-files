{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area in [[The Chasm]])
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that elemental life-form came all the way here on its own and spent a long time by itself?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wouldn't it already have become [[The Withering]] like the others...?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' There is a chance that it could avoid that end, using the power of something here...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm referring to what was used to fight against the [[Abyss]]. It once repaired the rifts of Teyvat long ago.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It has the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in Teyvat.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Forbidden knowledge that its light has shone upon is kept here forever in a different form...
:{{DIcon}} You mean... the [[Oozing Filth]]?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yup. It's just like soap bubbles that rise to the water's surface.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, another strange metaphor... But Paimon somehow gets this one.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 hydrofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' What the Lord of Dendro means is that the apocalypse was altered by the power of the [[Spiritstone|giant spike]] and hidden within the Oozing Filth.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, and it shouldn't be far from here. Let's go and take a look.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look! It's over there!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Looks like we'll have to clear out the Oozing Filth in this area. You two should be able to take care of it, right?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, we know what to do. We'll just use the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant|Lumenstone]] on the Oozing Concretion!

;(Destroy the [[Oozing Concretion]] and defeat the enemies)
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We finally managed to rescue it...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It should be the life-form from the prophecy.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That light...
:{{color|menu|Nahida seems to find the light that faded from the Fungus before her quite familiar...}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' !
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, something dark is coming out... Something's not right!
:{{DIcon}} Everyone, back up.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's going on? Didn't Nahida say it was purified?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Maybe it's because such a long amount of time has passed.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Although the power of the Oozing Filth is more stable than that of the apocalypse, it is still a form of dangerous power.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It might have lost its mind after being soaked in it for such a long time.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... but we still have tons of questions we need to ask.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I should be able to purge it with my elemental power.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, don't do it!
:{{DIcon}} This is definitely connected to forbidden knowledge.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But this is our only chance.
:{{DIcon}} I said no, and I mean it.
::{{DIcon}} We can't go through that again.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}...
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, I got a little anxious.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's okay... I trust your judgment. I was being a little hasty myself. Let's see if we can think of another way.
:{{DIcon}} What about the crystal...?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah! You said that the elemental power in the crystal was identical to theirs.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You want to use its power? But...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The Lord of Dendro seems hesitant. I too, would advise caution.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It's risky to use its power without fully understanding its intended use.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 anemofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus:''' Don't understand. This no good... That no good... Save life... important.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes, I understand, but this is our only chance to return home. We cannot afford to be careless.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's okay, there's no need to argue. I'll think of something to do about the elemental power that will be used.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm, how about this... {{Traveler}}, you could try using it.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I understand that you have an amazing resistance to forbidden knowledge.
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't overdo it, {{Traveler}}. Paimon will be worried!
:{{color|menu|You walk forward and use the power of the crystal to heal the anomalous elemental creature...}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' ...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Ugh...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Lord of Dendro... and you others... How long... How long have I been waiting here?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Looks like it worked!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' The Lord of Dendro, here in person... Does that mean... the apocalypse has come to an end?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Wait, did you... get smaller again?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm sorry, that portion of my memory is highly unreliable at the moment... I can't seem to remember who you are...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Hmm, that sounds about right. After all, the purpose of my existence is precisely for those "unreliable" memories you speak of.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 08.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' You once said that the apocalypse will be completely eradicated and that relevant memories will become unstable.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 09.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Even you couldn't promise that you'd remember our agreement after those events take place.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 10.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' However, you are definitely someone who stays true to your word. My sacrifice is nothing compared to your resolve.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You and I made the agreement?
:[[File:What Shape Does the Self Hold Graphic 1.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 11.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Yes. You used your power to protect me. That is the reason why I was able to survive here.{{clr}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 12.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' To be honest, I'm nearing my end... I had thought I'd be stronger than this.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 08.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' No one can withstand the power of the apocalypse.
:[[File:What Shape Does the Self Hold Graphic 2.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 13.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' In order to preserve a somewhat stable memory, I had to change the power of the apocalypse into a different form.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 14.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Only the giant spike that fell from the sky was capable of doing something like that. But the moment I chose to go through with it...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 15.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Is the moment I lost my chance of being rescued by the Lord of Dendro...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 16.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' But enough about me. Lord of Dendro, let's get to the important matter at hand. As you can see... I won't last much longer...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I understand, and I'm sorry. But...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Can you please tell me what this is?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 17.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' This... is a Fire Seed. It's an essential item for saving the Dendro Dragon. Thankfully, it appears to be in good condition.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 18.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' The Lord of Dendro and our people created this item together. It mimics how the Dendro Dragon's "Heart of Oasis" operates.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 19.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' The Dendro Dragon has been tormented by the apocalypse for far too long. It too is nearing the end of its power.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 20.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' However, if you are able to reactivate its Heart of Oasis using the Fire Seed, then the Dendro Dragon will begin to recover.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 21.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' And as a result, our homeland will return to the way it once was.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So the Heart of Oasis is Apep's source of power...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder the crystal was able to heal this Fungus just now. That's what it's used for.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 22.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' What?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 23.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' You used... the Fire Seed to save me?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm. Why? What's wrong?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 24.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' That's... Uh, never mind, it's not your fault. You didn't know.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 25.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' The Fire Seed contains a high concentration of elemental power inside of it. It's very powerful yet fragile at the same time.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 26.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' It is not stable in its current form. To prevent any accidents, please don't use it again.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Since I am its creator, I will take responsibility for it. I assure you there's no need to worry.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 27.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Alright. Aside from being able to heal the Dendro Dragon, the Fire Seed can also resonate with the Heart of Oasis.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 28.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' In other words, you'll be able to find the Dendro Dragon by following the guidance of the Fire Seed.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 29.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' But you should hurry, there is little time to waste.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 anemofunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus:''' What... about you?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 30.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Forget about me. You should hurry home now.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 09.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Everyone is returning home, including you.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 31.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' As I told you, I've already lost my chance to be saved by the Lord of Dendro.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 32.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Lord of Dendro, I thank you for coming to find me and for being willing to save the Dendro Dragon.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 33.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' Our past has been saved, and our future has been ensured.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 geoshroomfunguslifeform 34.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom:''' It's enough for me just knowing that they will return home.
:{{color|menu|With its mission accomplished, its life also reaches its end...}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey... wait!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It turned into... Oozing Filth.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 10.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Can you use the Lumenstone once more? I can still feel its elemental power.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 11.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Please... Of all of us, it deserves the chance to return home the most.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:{{color|menu|You use the Lumenstone once again...}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This is a small ball of light that it left behind...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 12.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' I can feel it... I can feel its knowledge and emotions... It has all returned to its original elemental form and is becoming one with the other family members.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 13.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Do not be sad, my friends. Its wish has come true and it's very happy right now.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Because its external form doesn't matter, right?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 hydrofunguslifeform 14.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes, because our external form does not matter, and our home has been saved. There is nothing more important than being together with family.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 anemofunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus:''' Let's go. Home.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 2 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Home...

{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|The elemental life-form spoke of past events and used Nahida's crystal to discover the truth. Next, you must use the crystal's directions to find Apep.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area near the outdoor [[Bayt Al-Sukr]] Teleport Waypoint)
:{{color|menu|You come to the desert depths to seek out Apep the Dendro Dragon...}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's not much further. Follow me, we're close now.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I can feel its power lingering and shifting around us. Sometimes it feels distant, but other times it seems close. This is its way of warning us.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It has already noticed our presence.

;(Approach the smaller marked area)
:;(A cinematic begins)
::{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We won't be able to see anything if we keep going that way.
::{{color|menu|The sky-enveloping sandstorms obscure your sight. You can only sometimes see a gigantic form that blots out the sun in the distance...}}
::{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! Something's over there!
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We've found it... Apep, the Dendro Dragon.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knew it would be big, but... not THAT big!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 01.ogg}} '''Apep:''' Puny god, puny human... Leave my domain.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 02.ogg}} '''Apep:''' Frail life-forms like you cannot survive in the endless sands of the desert.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Apep, we're here to save you.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 03.ogg}} '''Apep:''' I do not need saving. Especially not by you, Buer.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 04.ogg}} '''Apep:''' You are no different from [[Amun]]. Both of you have only existed for a fraction of what you know as time, yet you call yourselves lords of this land by leaning on the heavens' glow.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 05.ogg}} '''Apep:''' You're better off paying attention to your path ahead, as you will fall where you've fallen before.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I know that you hate both gods and humans, but you've grown too weak now. Can't you let go of your hatred, even for only a moment?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 06.ogg}} '''Apep:''' Let go... for only a moment?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 07.ogg}} '''Apep:''' Foolish Buer. You will find no gratefulness from me, even if you heal me.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 08.ogg}} '''Apep:''' You will only be reviving the dragon that will destroy Sumeru and the seven nations!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No. You're ill, that's all.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 09.ogg}} '''Apep:''' That I am. Time will bring death to all, it's unavoidable. Although I am gravely ill, my mind remains clear.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 10.ogg}} '''Apep:''' I am different from the ancient dragons that came to terms with you!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' There's no need for this. There is no point in fighting, what we need is the truth.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 11.ogg}} '''Apep:''' Hmph. "The truth"... the shackles that the God of Wisdom cannot escape from.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 apep 12.ogg}} '''Apep:''' I have paid dearly for the truth, and you shall do the same soon enough.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, don't leave!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Careful! Something's coming!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wahh! What is that? Paimon's never seen that before!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 hydrofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It's our family.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? They're your family too!? But they don't look anything like Fungi!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 anemofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus:''' External form... not important. Inner nature... same.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 hydrofunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The composition of their elemental power is identical to ours. In other words, they're residents of our homeland.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Is this what they've become after experiencing the apocalypse?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 hydrofunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' This is also a form of adaptation, although a most gruesome and pitiful one. Many of our family members never made it out of the Dendro Dragon...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 hydrofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' They've gradually taken this form in order to survive the apocalypse.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Is there any way to avoid fighting them?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, can you guys talk? We're here to rescue you!
:'''Strange Elemental Life-forms:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} They're not responding.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' They've given it their all just to survive.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 hydrofunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' They're being drawn by the Fire Seed. Only its power can temporarily free them from their pain.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 hydrofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' All that remains are the instincts to survive and search for energy needed to do so. Everything else has been discarded in the process of adaptation.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is the result of forbidden knowledge...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Would our world become the same if the forbidden knowledge was allowed to rampage across Teyvat...?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Like fish struggling on land... unable to find a single puddle of fresh water in the entire world...
:{{DIcon}} We can talk about this later.
:{{DIcon}} Let's deal with them first.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 3 hydrofunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes. But please, try to be gentle with them. They are not evil in nature... All they want to do is survive.

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks they've used up all their strength! They don't seem aggressive anymore...

:{{A|vo nhdlq102 4 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It won't require much elemental power. I'm just worried that it'll become unstable.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 4 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But as long as I use my elemental power to stabilize it a little, it shouldn't be a problem.

:{{A|vo nhdlq102 5 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I don't care about what you believe in, who you hate, or what you've done in the name of hatred... Nor do I expect you to be grateful.

:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm not sure. Perhaps the Fire Seed was only capable of protecting one person...?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But if I didn't use its power on everyone, there's no way of knowing where you could have been sucked into.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' And even if that's the case... There's no reason for it to simply shatter... Unless...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Unless what?

:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I... *sigh*
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Don't worry, Paimon. This is my responsibility. The Fire Seed is technically just a ball of highly concentrated elemental power.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Although my elemental power is slightly different than that of elemental life-forms, I gained a better understanding of it when I turned into a Fungus.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So, all I have to do is imitate that power while adding some of my own, and I'll be able to do what the Fire Seed was supposed to...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're... gonna become the Fire Seed?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. It'll take a lot of power from me, but it still won't be anything compared to when I was in the desert...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I might, however... become even smaller.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happens if you keep getting smaller?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'll become a blade of grass or a twig. Basically, I'll return to how I was first born.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I will be able to unleash power beyond my limits if I can reverse the process of growth.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But you'll lose everything! You'll not only lose your appearance, but you'll lose your emotions, memories, and who knows what else!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's alright. None of that matters compared to the dangers that Apep is facing right now.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no, wait! There has to be another way! Besides, what will Sumeru do if you turn into a twig!?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Maybe you and {{Traveler}} can plant me in the soil of Sumeru once it is all over.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I can still communicate with the world through the forest. It's just that you won't be able to see me for some time...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can't be serious...!
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 7 paimon 15a.ogg}} {{A|vo nhdlq102 7 paimon 15b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If {{Traveler}} were here, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} definitely wouldn't let you go through with it!

:{{A|vo nhdlq102 9 apep 25.ogg}} '''Apep:''' When Al-Ahmar's proud kingdom collapsed, I swallowed him whole as I agreed and absorbed his elemental power.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 9 apep 26.ogg}} '''Apep:''' However, what I gained was no benefit... No, I gained the apocalypse.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 9 apep 27.ogg}} '''Apep:''' I used up all my strength just trying to keep the pain under control... I had no energy to analyze the knowledge he had accumulated...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 9 apep 28.ogg}} '''Apep:''' But even then, I still believe that his insanity was far greater than that of my own.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's how the apocalypse started...
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 9 apep 29.ogg}} '''Apep:''' I admit that I fell for his trap. I was like a final fail-safe in his plan.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 9 apep 30.ogg}} '''Apep:''' Tiny Buer, and the rest of you... continue forward. I shall keep a watchful eye.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 9 apep 31.ogg}} '''Apep:''' How far will the life so dear and precious to the Heavenly Principles be able to go? I wonder...

:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The dragon will need to rest for a very long time before it is fully healthy again.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's not as ruthless as it was before. Curing the dragon of its illness has seemingly made it more open to reason.

:{{DIcon}} Bringing everyone home was supposed to be a happy occasion.
:{{DIcon}} But it seems to have lost some of its meaning.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Indeed, although they'll still have the chance to be born again, they've lost their memories of their journey and their feelings for their homeland.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Each opportunity for growth is unique in its own way.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Perhaps the immense power we released was the pouring out of all these irreplaceable emotions that had built up over time.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can you really call a place with no family your home...?
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Family... Right! The Hydro Fungus left behind its family.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Those two Fungi might be waiting for it to return.
:{{A|vo nhdlq102 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah! Let's hurry and go take a look. How are we going to explain all the complicated things that happened...?

==Trivia==
* While fighting the Warden of the Last Oasis, different voices are heard that are referred to as the "Voice in the Memories." The voice heard in Phase 2 sounds the same as that of the [[Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom]]. During the fight, it attempts to say something, but its voice is distorted incomprehensibly, and the caption simply reads "███████████████." Based on the story shared earlier in the quest, it was likely saying "[[Rukkhadevata]]," whose name would be blotted out due to her removal from [[Irminsul]].
