|text      = As I passed by the square today, I heard a little girl humming a song with her friends. To my surprise, it was a tune that I once performed... I greeted them and we sang a part of the song together.

It dawned on me that my songs have reached many people, and nothing would fill me with more pride than seeing others draw strength from them.

Hehe, do you ever find yourself humming songs? Do you sing along when you're happy? If you come across any lovely melodies, please do share them with me!
