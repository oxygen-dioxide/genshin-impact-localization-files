==Story==
Nabu Malikata, the Goddess of Flowers lived during the time when the [[Second Who Came]] arrived from beyond the firmament and brought war to her kin, though she acknowledges that they "brought about illusions that could break through shackles to the land." She was later "cast aside by the heavens" along with the rest of her kin, who were punished for an unknown sin by becoming stripped of their minds and becoming husks of their former selves. Somehow, Nabu Malikata was able to maintain her original form. According to legend, she wandered the barren wastes for seventy-two days. Springs gushed from her wounds, becoming streams that flowed into gardens. Water lilies grew in these gardens, and the [[Jinn]] were born from them. The first jinn begged her to stay with them, and she relented. Purple flowers resembling the moon bloomed wherever she stopped, and they were called [[Padisarah|Padisarahs]].<ref name=":0">Artifact Set: [[Flower of Paradise Lost]]</ref>

Some time later, she met Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and King Deshret, who shared his throne with them, even though most of Teyvat's gods were warring against each other for power during the [[Archon War]]. They were known as the God-Kings of Sumeru and were good friends. Nabu Malikata and King Deshret built the ancient civilization of [[Ay-Khanoum]] in the desert as an earthly paradise.<ref name="OAM">{{Ref/Item|Oasis Garden's Mourning}}</ref> The Goddess of Flowers was the originator and namesake of the {{lang|[[Sabzeruz Festival]]|zh=花神诞日|zh_tl=Birthday of the Goddess of Flowers}}, which originally commemorated Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthday.<ref name="TTGW">{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref> After Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, the Sabzeruz Festival became a celebration for her successor [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s birthday.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Philby}}</ref>

King Deshret was ambitious and rejected "the gift granted by the divine throne," wanting to seek his own path for his people. Nabu Malikata warns him not to seek out forbidden knowledge, telling him not to seek the [[Primordial One|Master]] of the [[Four Shades]] and inquire the mysteries of the stars and [[abyss]]. She tells him about the [[Divine Nail|divine nails]] and the calamities they caused. However, King Deshret remained undeterred and told her about his own ambitions. Nabu Malikata admired his rebellious spirit and decided to assist him in seeking the hidden knowledge, all the while knowing that she would die.<ref name=":0" />

According to legend, Nabu Malikata died "due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand."<ref name="OAM" /> While the actual cause of her death is currently unknown, it has been suggested that she had planned her death so that the bitterness of her death would preserve her legacy forever. King Deshret, who was enamored with her, never realized her intentions.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Oasis Garden's Truth}}</ref>

The original [[Padisarah]] flower went extinct with her death,<ref name="OAM" /> and although Greater Lord Rukkhadevata attempted to recreate the flowers, she was unable to recreate its original shade of purple.

Following Nabu Malikata's death, King Deshret eventually descended into madness and was further deceived by his counsels.<ref>{{Ref/Item|The Lay of Al-Ahmar}}</ref> Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, for her part, decided to leave King Deshret's side and create an oasis in a corner of the desert.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Olden Days of Scorching Might}}</ref>

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*''{{W|Nabu}}'' is an {{W|Ancient Mesopotamian religion|ancient Mesopotamian}} god of literacy, the rational arts, scribes, and wisdom. {{Lang|His name|akk=𒀭𒀝|akk_rm=Nabû}} means "announcer" or "authorized person" and is a cognate with several other Semitic languages, such as Arabic {{Lang|mini=1|ar=نبي|ar_rm=nabiyy}} and Hebrew {{Lang|mini=1|he=נביא|he_rm=naví}}, meaning "enlightened" or "prophet."
*''Malikata'' may be derived from Arabic {{lang|mini=1|ar=ملكة|ar_rm=malika|ar_tl=queen}} or from the ideogram of the Middle Persian word for queen, {{Lang|MLKTA|pal={{wt|𐭬𐭫𐭪𐭲𐭠|}}|pal_rm=bāmbišn}}.
**In the Eternal Oasis, her name is written as "NABU MLKTA" in [[Deshret Script]], the same as the ideogram of the Middle Persian word.
