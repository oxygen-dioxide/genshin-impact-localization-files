'''Nabu Malikata''',<ref name="TTWSFLT"/> the '''Goddess of Flowers''', also known by various names such as the Lord of Joy and Happiness and the Mistress of Dreams, is a deceased [[god]] who was a close friend of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], the previous [[Dendro]] Archon of [[Sumeru]].<ref name="sumeru teaser 3">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03: Prelude to Wisdom]</ref> The two were considered among the three God-Kings of Sumeru alongside [[King Deshret]], and were friends who each pursued their own paths towards "wisdom."<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Deepwood Memories}}</ref>

She was the creator of the [[Jinn]] and [[Khvarena]], and a survivor of the [[Angel|Angelic]] race.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For the Children of the Past|quote='''Arama:''' There was once a survivor of that race deep within the golden desert who was friends with [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Queen Aranyani]] and the [[King Deshret|ruler of Valuka]].}}</ref><ref name="FOPL">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Flower of Paradise Lost}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|Scroll of Streaming Song|quote=I am a spirit created at the beginning}}</ref>

==Profile==
===Appearance===
According to legend, Nabu Malikata was said to have "beautiful" horns on her head. The horns of [[Nilou]]'s crown in her default outfit, [[Neither Flower Nor Mist]], were made to reflect this trait.<ref name="TTGW">{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref> Nabu Malikata also wore an amethyst crown, which became traditional headgear for her priests.<ref name="amethyst">{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref>

When the [[Traveler]] sees Nabu Malikata in [[Liloupar]]'s memories, her appearance is described as being "ineffably beautiful," comparable to "the totality of her Jinn." However, when they meet her gaze, they are faced with "nothingness."<ref name="TEDEL"/>

Based on depictions of angels found in [[Dragonspine]]'s [[Mural Room]] and during the [[World Quest]] ''[[Revelations from the Past]]'', it can be surmised that like her sisters, Nabu Malikata had a winged body and long horns extending behind her head. It is also possible that she once stood several times taller than a human, though this may have simply been artistic license, as her throne is sized correctly for a human.

==Story==
Nabu Malikata was alive when the [[Second Who Came]] arrived from "beyond the firmament" and brought war to her kin, using [[forbidden knowledge]] to overturn the [[Heavenly Principles]]' rules. Forbidden knowledge devastated the land and forced the Heavenly Principles to cast down the [[Celestial Nail]]s to save it, at the expense of the human civilizations living there.<ref name="amethyst" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref> Due to some unconfirmed sin they committed, the Angels were "cast aside by the heavens" and punished by being stripped of their minds, becoming husks of their former selves. While Nabu Malikata was able to maintain her original form, most of the others became Seelies.<ref name="amethyst" /> According to legend, she wandered the barren wastes for 72 days. Springs gushed from her wounds, becoming streams that flowed into gardens. Water lilies grew in these gardens, and the [[Jinn]] were born from them. The first jinn begged her to stay with them, and she relented. Purple flowers resembling the moon bloomed wherever she stopped, and they were called [[Padisarah]]s.<ref name="FOPL" />

Sometime during the [[Archon War]], she met Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and King Deshret, who shared his throne with the other two. The three were known as the God-Kings of Sumeru and were good friends. Nabu Malikata was the originator and namesake of the {{lang|[[Sabzeruz Festival]]|zh=花神诞日|zh_tl=Birthday of the Goddess of Flowers}}, which originally commemorated Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthday.<ref name="TTGW"/> After Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, the Sabzeruz Festival became a celebration for her successor [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s birthday.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Philby}}</ref>

Nabu Malikata and King Deshret built the ancient civilization of [[Ay-Khanoum]] in the desert as an earthly paradise.<ref name="OGM"/> While Nabu Malikata was aware of King Deshret's affections for her, it is unknown if the feeling was mutual or not.<ref name="OGT">{{Ref/Item|Oasis Garden's Truth}}</ref>

At some point in time, Nabu Malikata foresaw the coming of the [[cataclysm]], so she created a shard of [[Khvarena]], whom she referred to as her daughter. This shard would eventually transform into the divine bird [[Simurgh]]. The divine bird would be destined to sacrifice itself during the cataclysm in order to save the [[Amrita Pool|Amrita]] from its [[abyss]]al corruption. Nabu Malikata gave the shard to Rukkhadevata, as she believed that Rukkhadevata's "light" was more radiant than hers.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Vourukasha's Glow}}</ref>

At some point, Nabu Malikata warned King Deshret against pursuing forbidden knowledge, the Heavenly Principles, or the "mysteries of the stars and abyss," relating her past experiences and the fate of the Angels to him.<ref name="amethyst"/> However, he remained undeterred and told her about his ambitions. Nabu Malikata was persuaded by the thought of rebellion and decided to assist him in seeking the hidden knowledge.<ref name="secret">{{Ref/Arti|Secret-Keeper's Magic Bottle}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Wilting Feast}}</ref> Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was heartbroken by her fellow God-Kings' plans, so she shepherded her own people away to create an oasis in a corner of the desert, leaving Nabu Malikata to wait for a return that never came.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Olden Days of Scorching Might}}</ref>

===Death===
According to legend, Nabu Malikata died from the "malice of the burning sun and yellow sand."<ref name="OGM" /> She used her body as a "conduit" for the "dazzling radiance" and may have deliberately caused a presumably Celestial Nail<ref group="Assumption">The basis for the existence of a nail involved in Nabu Malikata's death is based on her warning about the 'crystalline sapphire nail' and the environmental-altering capabilities associated with such objects. However, even if a divine nail was responsible for the sandstorm in the Desert of Hadramaveth, that could still have been the same one that used to strike Apep in the further past. Given that there is no mention of two nails exist at the same time in the desert's history, and judging how all other nails were casted down roughly around the time of the war with the Dragon King [[Nibelung]].</ref> to fall upon the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]] which created the endless sandstorms of [[Mt. Damavand]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Secret-Keeper's Magic Bottle|quote="I shall fashion you a bridge to allow you to slake your deepest wants. But you must fear not the crystalline sapphire nail..." [...] Using her body as a conduit and offering the oasis in trade, she let the dazzling radiance consume her to see his deepest desires be made manifest... Sandstorms swept in revelrous havoc across the paradise that was now missing one of its gods, folding the skies with yellow sand, swallowing all in calamity...}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Dream of Scorching Might|quote=But as the Lord of Flowers faded in the darkening sandstorm, so was the worriless golden paradise submerged by death.}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Honeyed Final Feast|quote=The gentle moonlight sank into the quicksand.}}</ref><ref group="Note">"The gentle moonlight" likely refers to Nabu Malikata, as this artifact description also compares her, Deshret, and Rukkhadevata to the "bright silver moon," "blazing golden sun," and "emerald fields" respectively.</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin|quote=At that time, the promised land of "Valivija" was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had fallen.}}</ref> She did this to help fulfill King Deshret's ambition and guide him to higher knowledge.<ref name="secret"/> Though her cause of death is not directly specified, she was likely killed in the destruction wrought by the allegedly Celestial Nail. It is suggested that she planned to die so that the bitterness of her death would preserve her legacy forever. King Deshret, who was enamored with her, never realized this intention.<ref name="OGT"/>

The original Padisarah flower went extinct with her death,<ref name="OGM" /> and although Greater Lord Rukkhadevata attempted to recreate the flowers in her friend's memory, she was unable to replicate its original shade of purple.

Following her death, King Deshret deceived the Jinn into becoming his servants by telling them the Goddess of Flowers was merely in a deep slumber, and in exchange for the Jinn's power, he would help them find her.<ref name="TTWSFLT"/> He created [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]] as a cemetery for her.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|A Moment Congealed}}</ref>


==Character Mentions==
{{Character Mentions|alias=Goddess of Flowers}}

==Trivia==
* Bilqis, used in the World Quest Series name [[The Dirge of Bilqis]], could be Nabu Malikata's personal name:
** A dirge is a mourning song performed at funerals, while Nabu Malikata's resting place, The Orchard of Pairidaeza, is unlocked during The Dirge of Bilqis. This suggests that the dirge is for someone named Bilqis, who in this case would logically only be Nabu Malikata.
** In Biblical accounts, Bilqis is the name of the {{w|Queen of Sheba}}, who travels to {{w|King Solomon}} bearing him great gifts and, in many variations of the story, whom she eventually marries. King Deshret's lore [[King Deshret#Trivia|draws inspiration]] from several parts of King Solomon's mythos, which suggests Nabu Malikata could be an analogue for Bilqis.
** The Orchard of Pairidaeza is located within the Desert of Hadramaveth, a name derived from the region of {{w|Hadhramaut}}. This area is often associated to be a part of the ancient kingdom of {{w|Sheba}}.

===Etymology===
* ''{{W|Nabu}}'' is an {{W|Ancient Mesopotamian religion|ancient Mesopotamian}} god of literacy, the rational arts, scribes, and wisdom. {{Lang|His name|akk=𒀭𒀝|akk_rm=Nabû}} means "announcer" or "authorized person" and is a cognate with words in several other Semitic languages, such as Arabic {{Lang|mini=1|ar=نبي|ar_rm=nabiyy}} and Hebrew {{Lang|mini=1|he=נביא|he_rm=naví}}, meaning "enlightened" or "prophet."
** Paralleling the horns atop Nabu Malikata's head, ''Nabu'' is described as wearing a horned cap.
** ''Nabu'' and his father ''{{w|Marduk}}'' also rode the winged dragon ''{{w|Mušḫuššu|Sirrush}}'' (more accurately rendered with modern knowledge of cuneiform as “Mušḫuššu”), a name which bears great similarity to one of Nabu Malikata's indirect descendants, [[Sorush]].
*** Note that this connection is highly tentative, as Sorush's name is likely derived instead from the Zoroastrian {{w|yazata}} ''{{w|Sraosha|Soroush}}''.
* ''Malikata'' is one of many forms of the Arabic word {{lang|mini=1|ar=مَلِكَة|ar_rm=Malika|ar_tl=queen}} (modern form) or alternatively {{lang|mini=1|ar=مَلَكَة|ar_rm=Malaka|ar_tl=queen}} (archaic form), or from the ideogram of the Middle Persian word for queen, {{Lang|MLKTA|pal={{wt|𐭬𐭫𐭪𐭲𐭠|}}|pal_rm=bāmbišn}}. 
** In the Eternal Oasis, her name is written as "NABU MLKTA" in [[Deshret Script]], the same as the ideogram of the Middle Persian word.
** ''Malikat''{{Lang|ar=ملكة|ar_tl=Queen of}} is {{w|construct state}} of the word ''Malika'', while ''Malikata'' is its accusative form with the same meaning. This is similar to how 'Queen of Sheba' is written in Arabic: {{Lang|mini=1|ar=ملكة سبأ|ar_rm=Malikat Saba}}.
** The use of {{Lang|mini=1|ar=ملكة}} in 'Queen of Sheba' allows it to be in either archaic or modern form depending on the context, with the common romanization is 'Malika'.
