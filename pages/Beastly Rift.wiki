A '''Beastly Rift''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Beryl Region]], [[Fontaine]]. It is a challenge in which the player is required to protect several crystals within an arcane formation from waves of [[Riftwolf|Riftwolves]]. The riftwolves will prioritize attacking the crystals over the player.

The formation will disappear after the challenge is completed.

==Lore==
"Beastly Rifts," a term coined by [[Rene]], refer to portals to the [[Abyss]]. At some point in their research, Rene and [[Jakob]] figured out how to successfully open these rifts using arcane formations. Their first attempts were short-lived and only spawned [[Rifthound]]s.<ref name="Page3">{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (III)}}</ref>

The formations that the [[Traveler]] encounters on [[Elynas]] were likely activated by Jakob in order to reverse the crystallization around [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]]' heart.<ref name="LDR">{{Ref/Quest|Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog|quote=Well, in theory, the arrays I activated in those ruins to reverse the crystallization would indeed have temporarily opened the way into the realm of beasts... I suppose that's how the monsters you mentioned were attracted here...}}</ref>

Similar formations can be seen in other locations related to Rene and Jakob's research, including at the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]] and the [[Book of Revealing]].

In order to conduct "uninterrupted" historical research during his stay in [[Natlan]], [[Enjou]] helped [[Kinich]] summon a Beastly Rift, which the latter would use to put [[Kongamato]] inside to prevent him from hurting the tribe. The Traveler would run into Kinich and they purged the rift of its inhabitants, though Kinich's plan eventually ended in failure when [[Trinidad]] destroyed the rift, believing that they were sending Kongamato to die in the Abyss.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Last Turnfire Night}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*Once a Beastly Rift is cleared, [[Breacher Primus]]es will appear the next time the place is visited.
**This may be a reference to how Breacher Primuses essentially act as [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]]' immune cells, driving harmful things away from his body.<ref name="LDR" />
