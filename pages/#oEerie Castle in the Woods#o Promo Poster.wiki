|description    = A promotional poster from the "[[Daiya's Three-Day Reverie]]" attraction in the [[Veluriyam Mirage]], depicting the central ideas and themes behind "[[Petrifying Gaze]]." The main image shows a sinister castle illuminated only by moonlight. From the towering trees beside the castle, perhaps the ghosts were originally intended to be related to demonic trees. But as owls also roost in said trees, perhaps their final choice of antagonist was a good one.
