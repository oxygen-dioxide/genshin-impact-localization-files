==Profile==
Temur is a soldier of the Ninth Company, sent to [[The Chasm]] to fight the darkness underneath, bringing a device along with them. The device brought in by the company failed and the group scattered. Temur remained with Anton and fellow soldiers Danila and Radomir. Temur was displeased with Anton taking charge and challenged his course of action. After finding out that they were no longer welcome in Liyue, Temur was concerned that the people of Liyue had betrayed them, but nonetheless agreed to retreat from the Chasm. He thanked the Traveler for their food and hoped that they wouldn't meet as enemies in the future.

===Personality===
Temur is a loyal soldier of the Fatui. He disapproves of Anton's actions and doubts his capability as Acting CO.

===Appearance===
Temur takes on the appearance of a [[Fatui Skirmisher - Pyroslinger Bracer]].
