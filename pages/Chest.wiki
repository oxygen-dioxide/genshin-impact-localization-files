'''Chests''' in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' are objects that can be found around the world of [[Teyvat]] and as rewards for completing certain [[domains]].

Opening chests usually rewards the player with [[Primogem]]s, [[Adventure EXP]], [[Sigils]] and [[Mora]] that are sent straight into the player's [[Inventory]], and a random assortment of [[Weapons]], [[Artifacts]], and [[Character EXP Materials]] that either pour out of the chest, or are occasionally sent straight to the player's inventory when the chest is in a precarious location. There are also [[Achievements]] that are granted upon opening a certain number of chests within a region.

[[Treasure Compass]] [[gadgets]] can be used to search for chests within their respective regions, with some exceptions. (For example, [[Anemo Treasure Compass]]es cannot be used within the [[Dragonspine]] region.) The blueprints for these gadgets are obtained as a reward for reaching [[Reputation]] level 6 in [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]] and level 9 in [[Inazuma]], [[Sumeru]], and [[Fontaine]] and at max Reputation level with [[Tribe Reputation#Gifts from the Speaker's Chamber|3 different tribes]] in [[Natlan]].

==Types of Chests==
There are five types of chests: Common, Exquisite, Precious, Luxurious, and Remarkable.

They can reward various items, including {{Item|Primogem|25|text=Primogems}}, {{Icon/AR EXP|25}} [[Adventure EXP]], {{Item|Mora|25}}, {{Item|Anemo Sigil|25|text=Sigils|link=Sigils}}, [[Character EXP Materials]], [[Weapon Enhancement Materials]], [[Weapons]], and [[Artifacts]]. For more information, see the [[#Chest Rewards|Chest Rewards]] section.

Additionally, some chests are hidden and have to be dug up from the ground. There is often an object that marks the location of a chest (e.g. sign, shovel, pile of rocks). The presence of [[Treasure Hoarders]] may also indicate that a hidden chest is nearby. When walking near its location, the option to "Dig" will appear; selecting this option will cause the chest to appear.

Some chests are encased in [[Dendro Vines]], ice, or rocks, which have to be destroyed before the chests can be opened. Dendro Vines and ice are destroyed with Pyro, while rocks are destroyed with [[Blunt Attack]]s or melee attacks that deal [[Poise Damage]].

Common, Exquisite and Precious Chests found in most Mondstadt and Liyue areas give the minimum number of primogems (0 for Commons, 2 for Exquisite and 5 for Precious). Exceptions to this are the areas of these regions with the highest Zone Level scaling, e.g. with the highest environmental damage multiplier: [[Dragonspine]] and [[Stormbearer Mountains]] in Mondstadt and [[Guyun Stone Forest]], [[Lisha]] and [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] in Liyue.<ref>KQM Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/general-mechanics/overworld#zone-levels Zone Level maps]</ref><ref>[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y2LJvgPb0BZF3k2fuEb7VqgM5oE1TTC34hAvgaqPuq8/edit#gid=1332283071 Chest rewards across zone levels]</ref> Chests in the aforementioned areas, as well as all nations other than Mondstadt and Liyue, give the maximum number of primogems (2 for Commons, 5 for Exquisite and 10 for Precious).

==Additional Information==
*Certain daily commissions will despawn chests. The chests will then spawn back when re-exploring the area.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jokxcb/daily_commission_quests_in_some_areas_will/ Daily Commissions Will Cause Some Chests to Despawn Temporarily]</ref>
*All chests are present in Teyvat the moment the game starts, although some chests may disappear and reappear on certain days.<ref>[https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1d54y1y7fG?p=1 Bilibili Video: Collecting Chests in Mondstadt]</ref>
* Some Common Chests are covered in rock or thorns, which require Heavy attacks (from Claymore hits, Geo attacks, or explosive abilities) and Pyro attacks respectively to become accessible.
* Chests that are unlocked by defeating enemies that respawn will be locked again when the enemies respawn. Chests that are unlocked by defeating one-time enemies that spawn on approach as well as through any other mechanism, such as completing a puzzle or digging at a spot, will remain unlocked permanently.
*All chests spawn with a sound, regardless of whether they have a prerequisite for appearing or not. Chests that are already located in the open world normally spawn when the player is too far away to hear the sound. However, for players who experience lag, chests may not spawn until the player is close enough to hear the sound.

===Discovering Hidden Chests===
While many chests are exposed, and can be located through the usage of a [[Treasure Compass]], certain chests will be hidden from the player and must be revealed through various methods.

*Guiding [[Seelie]] or [[Monetoo]]
*Killing [[monsters]]
*[[Time Trial Challenge|Time Trials Challenges]]
*Popping [[Floating Anemo Slime]]s
*Popping [[Bloatty Floatty|Bloatty Floatties]]
* Standing on specific spots
*Digging at specific spots (often marked with a shovel or a sign)
*Picking up [[Carrot]]s from the ground in [[Mondstadt]]
*Picking up [[Sunsettia]] from top of a tile in [[Mondstadt]]
*Lighting torches, campfires, etc.
*Activating [[Windmill Mechanism]]s and [[Elemental Monument]]s
*Creating Geo constructs in certain locations and on top of [[Pressure Plate]]s
*Destroying piled rock monuments
*Destroying pillars of rocks in [[Liyue]]
*Using Pyro or Anemo to clear away piles of dirt (leaves)/Dendro elements
*Defeating disguised [[Whopperflowers]]
*The 10 large ambers found on [[Mt. Hulao]] can all spawn 1 chest each. They appear to spawn randomly, so players must return to the location once the ambers reset.

== Achievements Counters== 
Within the game's [[achievements]], some of them contain information on the amount of chests opened by region. The highest known numbers for those achievements are: '''523''' in [[Mondstadt]], '''1149''' in [[Liyue]], '''234''' in [[Dragonspine]], '''731''' in [[Inazuma]], '''185''' in [[Enkanomiya]], '''248''' in [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]], '''1475''' in [[Sumeru]], '''945''' in [[Fontaine]], '''333''' in [[Chenyu Vale]] and '''830''' in [[Natlan]]. The chests counted on the counters are only those found in the open world in [[Teyvat]]. Chests that can be found in temporary quest locations, such as the Cathedral in [[Venti's New Plan]], or in [[Domains]] are not counted for the chest opening Achievements.

=== Bugs===
Over the course of updates, many bugs were found and fixed regarding chest counters: 

*Before the 1.1 update, some chests encrusted with ice, rock or vines did not count towards the counters. Those who collected chests at this time have affected [[Rock-Steady Treasure Hunter|Rock-Steady Treasure Hunter [Liyue]]] counters, with values ​​between 1055/1117 (excluding chest values ​​obtained from events).
*Before the 1.2 Update, some chests were randomly counted in both regions, [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]], causing an inconsistency in the count between the values ​​discovered by the players. This happened between the [[Bishui Plain]] and [[Windwail Highland]] regions. Whoever collected all the chests at this time have their counters between 518/1117 and 521/1114 (excluding chest values ​​obtained from events). '''It is not possible to get the maximum values ​​of chests in Mondstadt and Liyue counters at the same time due to this bug.'''
*There are still some chests from one region that count for another (Liyue chests that count for Mondstadt), And some chests that don't count for any region. However, doing all chests routes will guarantee the current count of exploration chests values.

==HoYoLAB Chests==
It is possible to track the amount of chests collected during the game through HoYoverse's official forum: [https://www.hoyolab.com/ HoYoLAB].
These are the highest values of each type of chests found until this moment. 7,552 unique chests counted to HoYoverse's official forum.

It is important to remember that:  
*Chest count in the forum includes all chests in the game, be they from open world [[Teyvat]], from [[World Quests]], [[Domains]] and limited duration [[Events]].
*The chests of some domains cannot be collected after the quest that grants access to this domain is completed.
*There are some profiles with values above the number of Luxurious Chests mentioned. This is due to a bug in Bennett's hangout mission, where players can repeat the mission as many times as they want and the counter will count each time the chest is opened. (This bug is already fixed and the Luxurious Chest no longer counts in HoYoLAB.)<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/3763261 Chest Bugs for Battle Chronicle]</ref>

===Time-Limited Chests===
Some chests are available for a certain time limit within the game. After this time, they could no longer be collected. These chests counted towards HoYoLAB records in its Summary section.

* 15 chests (3 Luxurious, 9 Precious, 3 Exquisite) from [[Lantern Rite]] event in the mission [[Beneath Splendent Lanterns]]. These chests were only available during [[Version 1.3]].
* 138 chests (6 Luxurious, 10 Precious, 58 Exquisite, 64 Common) from [[Midsummer Island Adventure]]. These chests were only available during [[Version 1.6]].
* 48 chests (16 Exquisite, 32 Common) from [[Labyrinth Warriors]] event. These chests were only available during [[Version 2.2]].
* 4 chests (4 Exquisite) from [[Shadow of the Ancients]] event. These chests were only available during [[Version 2.2]].
* 125 chests (6 Luxurious, 15 Precious, 32 Exquisite, 72 Common) from [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]]. Only 3 Precious Chests counted towards the HoYoLAB records. These chests were only available during [[Version 2.5]].
* 253 chests (8 Luxurious, 21 Precious, 94 Exquisite, 130 Common) from [[Summertime Odyssey]], of which 182 chests will also be counted in the Event Review section. Only 12 Exquisite and 14 Common chests did '''NOT''' count towards the HoYoLAB records. These chests were only available during [[Version/2.8|Version 2.8]].
* 175 chests (7 Luxurious, 24 Precious, 74 Exquisite, 70 Common) from [[Secret Summer Paradise]], of which 177 chests (including [[Preprint]] Chests) will also be counted in the Event Review Section. Only 2 Luxurious, 1 Precious, 6 Exquisite and 1 Common Chests counted towards HoYoLAB records. These chests were only available during [[Version/3.8|Version 3.8]].
* 147 chests (7 Luxurious, 23 Precious, 60 Exquisite, 57 Common) from [[Summertide Scales and Tales]], of which 143 chests will also be counted in the Event Review section. All chests counted towards HoYoLAB records. These chests were only available during [[Version/4.8|Version 4.8]].
* 2 chests (1 Precious, 1 Common) from [[Springtime Charms]] event inside a domain during [[The Funeral Parlor Has No Master, Yujing Terrace Calls the Troops]] mission. These chests were only available during [[Version/5.3|Version 5.3]].

==Investigation Points==
{{Main|Investigation}}
Investigation points can be found throughout villages, Treasure Hoarder encampments, and in other places throughout the world attached to objects such as barrels or abandoned carts.

They drop low value items, including a small amount of [[Mora]] {{Icon/Mora}} and relevant items (for example, barrels often drop [[Cooking Ingredients]], while Treasure Hoarder caches drop low-value [[Artifacts]]). Unlike chests, investigation points will respawn, tied to the [[Reset|server reset time]].

While not technically chests, these investigation points do trigger the healing effect of the [[Adventurer]] [[Artifact Set]], and therefore bear mention here.

==Trivia==
* Crude Chests were a type of chest only found in the [[Favonius Cathedral]]'s basement (accessed during the quest ''[[Venti's New Plan]]''), but they were replaced with Common Chests in [[Version 1.2]] or prior. They dropped 500 [[Mora]] and 1 [[Wanderer's Advice]].
*If a player opens a chest that normally sends its items straight into the inventory while they are not able to store all of its contents because of the inventory limit, the entirety of its contents are dropped to the ground instead of being sent to the inventory, even if part of the contents could have been picked up without hitting the limit.
