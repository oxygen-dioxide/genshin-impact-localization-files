The '''Dressing Room''' allows players to customize their characters after completing the first step of the {{Quest|Dragon Storm}}. The Dressing Room can be opened by selecting the {{Icon|customfile=Dressing Room Icon.png}} icon in the [[Character Menu]]. Once a [[Character]] has reached Level 90, the icon expands to a larger button and includes the text "Dressing Room."

This customization is purely aesthetic and has no impact on the gameplay.
