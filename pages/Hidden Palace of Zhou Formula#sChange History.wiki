* The English description for the domain entrance was updated (differences boldfaced):
** '''{{Color|Old description}}:''' There is a secret ritual that can conceal one gate out of eight '''meant to seal evil, in order to cut off its escape'''. This ritual was performed here long ago, sealing demons within this labyrinth. Rumor has it that the Method to fit Pillars with Zhou Formula presently seals an evil '''serpent'''.
** '''{{Color|New description}}:''' There is a secret ritual that can conceal one gate out of eight''', cutting off the route for evil to escape'''. This ritual was performed here long ago, sealing demons within this labyrinth. Rumor has it that the Method to fit Pillars with Zhou Formula presently seals an evil '''Chi'''.
