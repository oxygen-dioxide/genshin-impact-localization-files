|text    = I recently caught wind that the troops are planning a birthday celebration for me. Though I don't want to trouble everyone, I also don't want to disappoint them. After some consideration, I've decided to host a tournament. The format will require participants to register in teams of two, which will allow each person to demonstrate their individual skill on top of promoting teamwork and trust!

I've sent letters to [[Captain Beidou]] and [[Kazuha]], and I hope they can make it here on time. As for [[Narukami Island]], [[Arataki Itto]] was the first to reply, saying: "Don't you worry, 'cause victory belongs to Arataki 'No Doubt About It-to'!" [[Thoma]] has also responded that he intends to participate alongside [[Taroumaru]].

Such a gathering of masters and experts &mdash; ah, I can barely contain my excitement... Um, I mean&mdash; would you come join the tournament as my partner? That is, if you have the time, of course. With you by me side, we'd be invincible!
