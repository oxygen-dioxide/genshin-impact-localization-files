|description    = A tall, straight, lavender-colored Sakura Tree with a graceful posture. The trunk is exceptionally sturdy, and the blossoms and leaves are known for their "indecisive" color, sometimes appearing redder, other times appearing bluer.<br>The Sakura Tree is known as a tree of limitless inspiration. A common motif in [[Inazuma]]'s folk stories is that whenever a writer suffers from writer's block, they will walk around a tall Sakura Tree, with whose hues they share an affinity in their moment of creative indecision. In just nine steps, a creative idea will drop into their mind like a falling Sakura blossom. This is how the tall Sakura Tree earned its name of "Between Nine Steps."
