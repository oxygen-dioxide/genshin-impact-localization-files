Everything has been going well in the [[Fortress of Meropide]], so you don't have to worry about me.

Although our resources are limited underwater, everyone still enthusiastically celebrated my birthday. I really enjoy my birthdays, it's a good opportunity to observe the changes in everyone's facial muscles: the nervousness before giving a gift, the sigh of relief when I accept it, and the joy after receiving compliments... I can't wait to draw it all down as a memento!

By the way, would you like to see your sticker? A nice, round skull, pearly white teeth, firm orbicularis oculi muscles, bright and clear eyes... To me, these things are what make you adorable.

It's been a while since you went to [[Natlan]], hasn't it? Have you gotten any bumps or bruises? Why don't we meet today? I'll give you a thorough check-up to make sure you're healthy so I can rest easy!
