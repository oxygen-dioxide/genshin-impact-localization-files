{{Dialogue Start}}
;While indwelling a saurian
:'''Dingonek:''' Those two are fighting again...
:'''Dingonek:''' Or maybe they aren't? The [[Xican|older fellow]] looks to be in good enough spirits, but the [[Kabnal|younger one]] seems downcast.
:'''Dingonek:''' Really, I've never seen such passionless conversation. No wonder they can't reach any conclusion.
:'''Dingonek:''' Without the slightest passion, not even the strongest of [[Saurian]]s can fly!
