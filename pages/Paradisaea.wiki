==Trivia==
* The term bird-of-paradise and the Paradisaeidae species in particular are associated with the {{w|Huma bird}}, a mythical creature said never to alight on the ground. It is both male and female in nature, has the power to bestow kingship on any it flies over, and is unable to be caught alive, with any who kill it being doomed to die in 40 days. It is also described as phoenix-like, being reborn in flames every 500 years, a feature which is further referenced in Kaveh's default outfit style, [[Gold Pinions in Flames Bathed]]. The Huma bird is also stated to be a benevolent bird of fortune, with an auspicious shadow that grants life-long happiness to those who catch a glimpse of it.
