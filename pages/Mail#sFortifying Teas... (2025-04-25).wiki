Are you there? Ugh, could you talk some sense into Baizhu for me? He just finished seeing his patients and jumped right back into testing medicines. No sense of proportion or self-preservation, I tell you...

(Followed by elegant handwriting)

Ahaha... Sorry about that &mdash; as you can see, [[Changsheng]] has grown quite adept at writing with her tail. While her account isn't wrong, allow me to append it with a second opinion.

With spring turning to summer, it's normal for fatigue to set in. Even [[Herbalist Gui|Gui]] has fallen ill from delivering medicines, leaving [[Bubu Pharmacy]] busier than usual. I believe fortifying herbal teas can help improve one's health, hence my post-consultation efforts to refine the ingredients. Fortunately, after a few days of testing, the flavor and efficacy of the tea are now balanced. I've enclosed both the recipe and the ingredients in this letter. Feel free to brew a cup when time permits.

With that, I wish you both wellness and a safe journey ahead.
