|"There is time for you and me, enough to hesitate a hundred times.<br>Dally and daydream a hundred times, before one eats one's bread and tea.<br>Shake one's head and give up a hundred times, as the wrinkles climb to your eyes and no teeth remain to adorn your mouth."<br>&mdash; [[Breeze Amidst the Forest]]: Spins-In-Circles Simon<br><br>If you fall to stagnation, the way forward and back will be obscured.<br>At such times, any rash decision is merely an opportunity for future misfortune to ambush you.<br>Know that stopping to think things over is no sign of weakness, but always remember that your body is subject to the ticking clock.<br>And when the timepiece rings, you must make your move.

|-
|"The newly built holy place was vast and elegant. The artisans had poured all their talent and imagination into its construction.<br>The believers, overcome by euphoria, could not know that a single brick was missing from beneath the freshly painted altar.<br>Even the lead artisan had forgotten about this.<br>But in a mere three years, the whole structure would collapse in a storm for want of that single missing brick."<br>&mdash; Tales of the Holy Place<br><br>What we wish in our hearts to make reality, we pour all our soul into making perfect.<br>But beware the flaws that lie beneath a shining surface.<br>The surface of the sea is often calmest just before a tidal wave, and disaster needs but an instant to strike.<br>The flight of birds signals the coming tempest, and the mountains roar before an avalanche.<br>All evils have their portents, so be sure to keep your eyes wide open.

|-
|"All I have said above is based on daily experience, but what of things beyond that basis?<br>Just as the wise have said, once intelligence departs the borders of experience, it enters the realm of flighty fantasy,<br>And thus, this tome can provide no answers to such questions."<br>&mdash; Along with Divinity (IX)<br><br>It is futile to agonize over things that have yet to come to pass.<br>Rather than hesitate, why not take the first step, boldly pushing forward?<br>The path ahead may be fraught with unknown difficulties, but it matters not.<br>In this, your past experiences shall be your greatest teacher.
|-

|-
|"Don't fret, my friend."<br>Said the sly fox with a chuckle,<br><br>"Just stay in that tree hollow first.

|-
|"Once, I quarreled much with this world,<br>But the flame of my rage has since been quelled by life.<br>That was the epitaph I once wrote for myself,<br>But those are all empty words now,<br>For the good doctor has plucked that terrible, harmful button from my throat."<br>&mdash; Breeze Amidst the Forest: Anecdotal Anthology Part VI<br><br>When unfortunate incidents occur, good luck waves at you from secret places.<br>You will find an opportunity for a "turnaround" hidden in the most unexpected of corners.<br>What comes after can only be "better and best."<br>Perhaps taking the opportunity to sort things out at home will result in unexpected gains?
|-
|"Just yesterday he was a high and mighty tyrant, claiming to hold the peoples' fate in his hands.<br>Yet today, he has transformed into an earnest believer, begging for the [[Anemo Archon]]'s forgiveness.<br>Let us throw him into the dungeons!<br>For did he not spend his life before in opulent luxury, nothing more than a prisoner to desire?"<br>&mdash; History of Kings and Clans: Tyrants, Heirs, and Rebels (XII)<br><br>{{sic|Dissatifaction}} with present circumstances is suffocating, leading to much inward lamentation.<br>Fortune favors those who reach out early, so make preparations to make that stitch in time.<br>If you wait until sunset's final rays shine upon the treetops and the springwater beneath your feet is but parched riverbed...<br>At that point, no amount of inspired action will salvage the situation.
|-
|"[[Slime]]s can indeed be eaten. Not directly, of course, but in the form of thick, chewy ramen &mdash; after stretching one out multiple times, of course.<br>[[Consecrated Scorpion]]s from a distant nation, deprived of head and tail and generously sprinkled with numbing [[Mist Grass Pollen]], can be as delicious as crabs.<br>And have you seen the cross-cut atop a [[Stretchy Geo Fungus|Geo Fungus]]'s head? That's the surest sign of edibility!"<br>&mdash; Monstrous Gastronomy: Preface<br><br>People often say that you should not eat mushrooms you find growing by the road.<br>Yet how often they forget the basic principles of how to survive in dire circumstances.<br>Open your mind! Use what is before you to cut a path forward.<br>Surely, something preferable to being forced to eat monsters will happen to you.
|-
|"'I love everyone. Youths brown- or golden-eyed, overbearing friends, and even those considered mediocre.<br>Why, for these many loving gazes to slip away from my side like fine [[Dandelion Wine]] spilled to the ground undrunk... Such a thing would be completely intolerable!<br>How could you, then, accuse me of being fickle in my affections?'<br>'No, my friend. If you love all people, that just means that you have never learned what it means to truly love.'"<br>&mdash; Breeze Upon the Lake: Anecdotal Anthology Part VII<br><br>Overflowing synonymity often proves shallow and thin-spread, while experiences born of purity cut deeper.<br>Focus on what you're looking forward to most, and you'll be rewarded far more than you imagine.<br>Embrace sincere hope in your heart, and see the future of your dreams run toward you.
|-
|"Pike the Fox stole an apple pie and a bottle of grape wine.<br>A masterful digger was Pike.<br>Pike got a new necktie and woolen stockings.<br>These were secured on account of a cute little friend.<br>Now, Pike's friend suggested that they stop their hole-digging. Instead, they should move into a tall, impressive building, and there make acquaintance with refined company.<br>No problem, Pike said. One last job, and we'll retire.<br>Ker-thunk! The metal cage descended from on high, trapping Pike and his friend, and the howl of hunting hounds set them a-trembling.<br>What should they do? Pike looked this way and that frantically.<br>Quick, his friend shouted, quick! Dig a hole! Our way out is underground! Come on!"<br>&mdash; Mondstadt Fables Omnibus (IV): Pike the Fox<br><br>Though you may hold sweet, mellow wine in your hand, the wine in another's cup seems finer still.<br>Still, do not forget the fundamental differences that exist between yourself and others.<br>Polish the dust-lined pearl in your heart, for that is a precious thing.<br>And just like that fox's fine friend, be a fine "you."
|-

|"The child was about to depart, and his destitute mother could only bring a hand-drawn likeness of the god as a votive offering.<br>So simple and crude was the portrait that it would be worth nothing on the market.<br>Still, O Anemo Archon, please protect him. Protect that child,<br>For even in so meager a gift is held a mother's true heart."<br>&mdash; Breeze Amidst the Forest: Ode to the Thousand Winds<br><br>Wealth can add color to your life,<br>But it cannot add true happiness.<br>The value of an item lies not in its appearance,<br>For love and sincerity are the truest treasures.
|-
|"[[Vennessa|She]] once threw down the tyrant's tall tower, and she once broke the chains of slavery,<br>Countless other great deeds did she perform, but she has departed.<br>For the sake of our freedom and future, forget not her story!"<br>&mdash; History of Kings and Clans: Tyrants, Heirs, and Rebels (V)<br><br>History's mighty heroes have forged the lives we lead today,<br>And their stories give us the courage to face our struggles.<br>When such difficulties bog us down, it may behoove us to think upon our forebears!<br>Perhaps their sagas can be to us a font of wisdom and strength.
|-
|"When you hear the gentle breeze blowing over the fields, that is my voice calling you, brother.<br>Take my hand and journey with me, for to wander alone in distant lands is lonely indeed.<br>Let us pass through forests and long nights together, until we return to the homeland we've yearned for."<br>&mdash; Breeze Upon the Lake: The Wayfarer's Song<br><br>Refreshing springs and flowers, the summer breeze, familiar streets...<br>Every person has a "homeland" in their hearts that belongs only to them.<br>When you feel exhausted, slow down a little and look to the past.<br>It is the past, after all, that grants us the strength to move forward.
|-
|"The Seneschal called upon all his oratory powers in his appeal to the people to repair the holy sanctuary.<br>He would speak differently to different congregations.<br>To the old, he spoke of the divine might and saving grace. To the young, he painted a picture of prospective prosperity that would be purchased by the planned procurement of the property.<br>Till at last, the repairs were agreed upon by all."<br>&mdash; Tales of the Holy Place<br><br>The road ahead is a tangle of unexpected circumstances.<br>Sticking to dusty old strictures will only lead to further difficulties.<br>As such, be adaptable &mdash; use different strategies tailored to your situation to achieve victory.
|-
|"It thought that its time had come, and so put the heavy purse down.<br>Pretending to forget its master's command, it looked for a brief, sweet dream, or perhaps an eternal peace.<br>But as it lay down, it realized that the food for which it had been searching, the key to surviving this great snowfall...<br>Had at some point been hung upon its own tail."<br>&mdash; [[Wolfhook]] and [[Weasel Thief]]'s 200-Step Winter<br><br>Ill fortune often brings anxiety, and it will whisper ceaselessly in your ear.<br>It will tell you that you must keep your eyes on the prize, that you should keep moving toward it.<br>But rushing forward in a panic may instead make your wish impossible to realize.<br>Perhaps you lacked the needed calm or ignored vital help that might have been close to hand&mdash;<br>Like a wolfhook that got caught on your coat at some unknown point, becoming the perfect sustenance in time of dire need.
|-
|"The walls circling the tower were too grand, too majestic, and so the bricks and tiles needed were as numerous as grains of sand upon a beach.<br>Surely, who would notice if a few sand grains were missing? So thinking, the artisan tarried.<br>He would do a little every day, note the work he had done, and leave the rest for tomorrow.<br>Yet, the 'tomorrows' left to him were numbered.<br>The warriors who lifted high rebellion's song would enter through those gaps, saving them seven-tenths of the losses they might have otherwise suffered storming the walls...<br>The artisan watched this from afar, the secret delight in his heart mixed with fear and apprehension.<br>Fortune had smiled upon him this time, for his laxity had inadvertently birthed great beneficence.<br>But what about next time?"<br>&mdash; The Ones the Wind Forgot: [[Decarabian]]'s People<br><br>To cast one's hopes upon tomorrow in exchange for a brief moment of peace...<br>That something is tried and true is an intoxicating thought.<br>But what if the "you" of tomorrow is also waiting on opportunities created in the past?<br>Waiting for all the previously invested effort that has been built up for this moment to bring about some transformation?<br>This test of promise-keeping could only ever be approached one way.<br>Know that delay and regret are inseparable twins.<br>Perhaps it is best to take action immediately, both today and tomorrow.
|-
|"All is silent,<br>Upon [[Starsnatch Cliff]].<br>No winds are heard,<br>On the treetops,<br>No shape of birds,<br>So swiftly stop and rest,<br>Hurry not to press on."<br>&mdash; Breeze Amidst the Forest: Traveler's Night-Song<br><br>To persevere is no doubt important, but only rest can fight one's fatigue.<br>Though your labors shall bear fruit, do not overlook the beauty that lies before you.<br>Rest as needed. Do not miss out on such joys near at hand.
|-
|"That the people of [[Sal Vindagnyr|Vindagnyr]] revered the gods thusly is beyond doubt. Yet they were just as surely duped and deceived if they believed their duty to the gods beneficial to their lives in this world. The end that fate had decreed for them could not be called 'beautiful,' no matter how you look at it."<br>&mdash; Along with Divinity (III)<br><br>You go forward with dreams and hope in your heart, but not without an indistinct sense of unease.<br>If you desire guidance or answers, rely not on that which is external and illusory.<br>The world is filled with a cacophony of views, but among them, your inner voice alone can know that which is truest.
|-
|"Cover the flatbread with delicious mushrooms, cheese, and vegetables, and then roast it. The heated cheese can be pulled into long, thin threads, which makes for addictive bites. The fresh 'shrooms and crisp vegetables shall tread upon the path of cheese, hand in hand, and dance on the tip of your tongue."<br>&mdash; Mondstadt Gourmet Anthology (I): [[Mushroom Pizza]]<br><br>To hold regret and sorrow within oneself is unspeakable agony, to roast your very soul.<br>But just as Mushroom Pizza must go through the flames,<br>To become as fragrant as it is, persist, persist resolutely in your path.<br>One day, that hard work shall become something worthy of dance and song.
|-
|"This plain bathes in an everlasting breeze. An [[Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero|ancient, monumental tree]] left behind by a heroine from a bygone era speaks softly amidst the winds."<br>&mdash; Mondstadt Travel Guide: [[Windrise]]<br><br>As our ancestors said, in barren soil are the seeds of tomorrow buried.<br>Dreams and hope will eventually penetrate that dark, hardened earth, growing into a tree that touches the skies.<br>Enjoy the present moment, for this journey shall nourish the future.
|-
|"In amongst the darkness of the trees, soft patches of white could be seen weaving between the shadows.<br>With unfaltering trust, I followed the fox round and about, soon emerging from the dark forest in a seemingly faraway land.<br>There, in the moonlight, a sea of dandelions lay before me, stretching as far as the eye could see."<br>&mdash; [[The Fox in the Dandelion Sea (IV)]]<br><br>Everyone has moments where they feel trapped by doubt.<br>Believe in your heart and where it leads you, and go forth even amidst uncertainty.<br>Someday, you too will become like a [[dandelion]],<br>Unfettered, floating and flying free toward your distant dream.<br>The path to the future is not paved with only tears and moonlight.
|-
|"As things are I can no longer say,<br>Which is night and which is day.<br>If the dawn wind shall sing no more,<br>What shall we pray or sing hymns for?<br><br>O mine heart, you must like [[Ragnvindr]] be,<br>Exorcise the night and light the morn,<br>And let freedom's flowers bloom brilliantly,<br>Their torch across the plains by the west wind borne."<br>&mdash; Breeze Upon the Lake: Songs of Dawnlight Part VI<br><br>Any choice you make will change the present situation.<br>Do not be troubled by this, however, and step out ahead boldly onto the road ahead.<br>Carry hope in your heart and press on resolutely, just as the legendary knights once did.<br>And where the sun sets, the morning wind shall bring about a new day.
|-
|"You witch, you who ensnares human hearts, now let me atone for my sin.<br>Let me fall along with you, should you go to the Anemo Archon's punishment,<br>For the destruction reflected in your eyes is greater than all the hymns in this world."<br>&mdash; [[The Mondstadt Tower]] (III)<br><br>In pursuing a beautiful dream, one may find it as elusive as Inès's enchanting song.<br>Know that obstinate is not derogatory by any means, for it is only another way of saying "conviction."<br>But remember that the meaning of such a pursuit lies in the journey itself.<br>Do not forget the beautiful vision you beheld at the beginning amidst your chase.
|-
|"The mellifluous sound of the lyre and the sweet dawn dreams,<br>Bar my love's homeward steps, it seems.<br>Dandelion, dandelion, bear my song to her ears,<br>And should this sigh, this evening breeze she hear,<br>Might the form I yearn for yet return?"<br>&mdash; Breeze Upon the Lake: Song of Spring and Rose<br><br>Circumstances may not match your expectations, but in them also lurk new opportunities.<br>As long as you hold hope for the future in your heart, joyful days shall come again, right on schedule.
|-
|"Of these, [[Sweet Madame]] was a delicacy greatly loved by the early people of Mondstadt. All a family would need after a hard day's work was a little honey-marinated, roasted [[Fowl]] accompanied by a gentle evening breeze, and they could enjoy a delicious meal together. The [[Sweet Flower]] juices would seep into the tender meat, making for a dish most delectable."<br>&mdash; History of Kings and Clans: The Cultivation of Mondstadt (V)<br><br>Your long labors shall at last be rewarded, and days of relaxation shall soon arrive.<br>Go, enjoy song and merriment with the friends who accompanied you.<br>After all, neither fine treasure nor food can surpass the wondrous time you spent together.
|-
|"Hear you now these words I speak unto you. You are highborn. A ruling scion. Fresh leaves on a laurel crown. Nobility. Speak slowly, think deeply, and do not shout, lest you be taken for a shameless ignoramus."<br>&mdash; History of Kings and Clans: Tyrants, Heirs, and Rebels (III)<br><br>The days of the aristocracy are long dead and gone, but the instructive words from those days remain incisive.<br>Do not pride yourself on trivial achievements, or indulge yourself on impoverished benefits.<br>Arrogance blinds you in both eyes, such that you cannot see disaster staring you in the face.<br>Remain humble and maintain control &mdash; that is how you will achieve still greater things.
|-
|"There is a row of lush grape fields, astride that yonder lake.<br>The wind upon that land lies still, sweet fragrance to awake.<br><br>Yet darkened dusk is soon to fall, the storm shall shred the vines.<br>Harvest now, come one, come all, lest we drink the bitter wines."<br>&mdash; Breeze Amidst the Forest: Harvest Song<br><br>Just as flowers do not spring from the soil without cause, so too is it with how all and sundry denounce any gains made without putting in the work.<br>No amount of sighs will free you from a muck of trouble, and fields watered with negativity bear harvests of disaster.<br>Do not revel in indolence's sweet stupor, for it forges the shackles of defeat and lures people to terrible downfall.
|-
|"The keen blade that pierced him was forged from the [[Gladiator Shackle|gladiator's shackles]]. All that the nobility leaned upon became the root of their downfall."<br>&mdash; History of Kings and Clans: Tyrants, Heirs, and Rebels (XI)<br><br>The problem before you is complex and unusual, as impregnable as a tower.<br>But do not lose your way, for the answer is hidden within nonetheless.<br>Just as a blade can be forged from chains, so are your surroundings your secret strength.
|-
|"No wisdom in this world is set in stone and squirreled away. All knowledge should be discovered by those who come after. In this search, phenomena shall present propositions, while experimentation and induction shall birth the conclusion to said proposition."<br>&mdash; Alchemy 101: Preface<br><br>Knowledge stored in books does not wisdom make, no more than the reflection in a lake is the real thing.<br>Fools drink themselves into hypothetical stupors, while the sagacious seek truth earnestly.<br>Do not be deceived by false paralysis, but do not make reckless decisions either.<br>Cool rationality is the font of hope within chaos.
|-
|"The gentle breeze arrives, as grass and tree slowly revive.<br>Birds in chorus, flowers bloom, nature springs alive.<br>Ah, my love, listen now as to you my innermost feelings I confide."<br>&mdash; Breeze Amidst the Forest: Early Spring Series Part III<br><br>Spring sneaks up silently, and all things are renewed.<br>If you wish to gain something from it, then set out on your journey immediately.<br>Fortune favors the bold, so fear not the road ahead. Do not tarry for too long, or you may regret it.

!Unnamed slips
|-
|(The handwriting here is exquisite, to the point of seeming like some sort of printout. This doesn't look like a fortune slip...)<br>To be honest, we weren't the most familiar of people in the [[Hexenzirkel|organization]] [[Alice]] founded. But [[Barbeloth|I]] find that things and people around me have changed much in the many years that followed... and now, you are amongst the few I am most acquainted with.<br>I must confess that I did not initially understand what Alice saw in you. Being "interesting" was the measuring stick, said she, and being the "most interesting" was the only criterion for being invited to join. Later, I realized that I had only thought that I had understood your stories. That your acuity for the world's operating principles could perhaps sometimes surpass that of astrology. Sometimes, that is!<br>I, too, have grown old, and I do not know how long I have left. So yes, I admit that I really do miss you, just a little. Not that I would actually go over to keep you company or anything, though.
|-
|(Cutesy-looking handwriting. This seems nothing like a fortune slip...)<br>[[Alice|I]] travel around [[Teyvat]] every so often to see if any landscape-altering changes have happened in the meantime, rewriting my [[Teyvat Travel Guide|seven-nation travel guide]] once sufficiently few people remember my name.<br>But I've been feeling tired of late for some reason. Might be the coming of spring.<br>In Mondstadt, I met a girl who looked very much like you when you were little. I walked with her for a bit out of boredom, and as it turned out, she just so happened to be returning a book to the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters|library]]. [[The Boar Princess|One of yours]], in fact.<br>So I got it in my head to brag a little &mdash; I do have signed copies in my possession, after all! Didn't expect her to say that she didn't like your stories.<br>Thinking that she hadn't understood, I explained that the boar, the wolf, and the forest were all symbols. That they were each stand-ins, making the story a most deep mystery indeed.<br>You know what she said? "I know that. But the world has changed."<br>Ah, how I wish you were there at that moment! You'd have it out with her right there and then, and you'd end off by saying: "Well who's the author here, you or me?" But for some reason, I said nothing at all.<br>She looked askance at me for a few moments before pulling a hanky out and wiping the sweat born from the sweltering spring off my face. Then she waved, and disappeared completely into the crowd, bouncing pigtails and all.<br>I was so furious, you know &mdash; why, it almost brought me to tears! Really, what's a little girl's word on the state of the wider world, anyway? And so I must go see for myself. On that note, I shan't tarry here thinking about you too much. Today is a good day for traveling, after all.
|-
|(Messy handwriting. This doesn't seem much like a fortune slip...)<br>In truth, [[Mage "N"|I]] said all I wished to say to you in the end, but Alice still advised me to write a little, saying that what I cannot say aloud, I can always write, surely. That is the case, though I have spoken directly into peoples' minds for so long... that I never practiced my penmanship anyway.<br>No need to worry if I've pried into any of your innermost thoughts, I've never done anything like that. If that does not reassure you, let me share one of my secrets with you. Having been suffocated by my inability to speak, I wound up being an incredibly talkative person at first. Alice noted that those who used their real mouths to blather on with had far fewer problems than I, since I would set my head abuzz and give myself quite a headache whenever I spoke. She advised me to speak more steadily and present an air of mystery and nobility &mdash; which is how I wound up speaking the way you remember.<br>I'm off, in any case. There's not much to worry about here with you &mdash; so why don't you watch over me instead?
|-
|(Neat handwriting. This does not look like a fortune-telling slip...)<br>Barbie's gotten old, letting her emotions get in the way of proper writing. Not so [[I. Ivanovna N.|I]] &mdash; as the first Mayor, I requested Alice to help me settle various trifling matters in [[Snezhnaya]]. And in exchange, she asked that I pen a passage in here.<br>I do not believe in any world after death, so we must live our best while we still draw breath. As such, I do not think you will read a word I write here &mdash; I write to myself alone.<br>Neither of us ever had any magic or combat training. We are simply ordinary. As such, we might be able to come to an understanding, though I believe otherwise. Alice was too ██ing good to you. Back in the day, she dragged me through waterways, blowing furnaces up, catching a cat within a [[Domain]]... The process was complicated and far from straightforward, but in any case, it was meant to protect the people around us.<br>You might have wondered, is this the price of getting along with this gaggle of mad women? I doubt you would agree with that assessment, nor would I. Those were, after all, the most precious days of our time together, were they not?
