==Summary==
After handing over the [[Bloodbranch Coral]] to [[Tsuyuko]], the Traveler continues their adventures across [[Enkanomiya]] and come across a [[Sinshade]] named [[Eboshi]], who introduces herself as an auxiliary of Sangonomiya and one of the shrine maidens of Enkanomiya. She offers the Traveler a trial path that, if passed, would lead to more knowledge of Enkanomiya's secrets. The Traveler agrees to this trial and a cutscene plays in which three new subareas rise out of the fog below. In order to get to these new trial locations, Eboshi tells the Traveler to use the [[The Emanant Skylight|Emanant Skylights]] to transport themselves to each area where a [[Jibashiri]] will await.

After being recognized by the Jibashiri at all three of the trials, the Traveler returns to Eboshi who confers knowledge about the [[Bathysmal Vishaps]], the [[Watatsumi Omikami]], the time before the sun and moon, and the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]].

==Lore==
The people of Enkanomiya built the ''Towers of the Three Realms'' at the borders of Byakuyakoku. Because Byakuyakoku was on the border between three different realms, the Human realm, the Elemental (Vishaps) realm, and the Abyssal (Void) realm, they built these towers to stabilize the tendencies of Byakuyakoku and maintain harmony between the three realms. Since these towers are so important, they are hidden using secret arts and can only be summoned by shrine maidens, such as [[Eboshi]], and the Vassals of Watatsumi.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|3}}</ref> The ancient names of these towers have been long forgotten, but have been renamed to [[Yachimatahiko's Locus]], [[Yachimatahime's Locus]], and [[Kunado's Locus]].
