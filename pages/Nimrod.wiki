==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nimrod:''' Oh, hi. What's the matter?
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Nimrod:''' That... was... terrifying! If i hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would have sworn that someone was talking out the back of their drunk little heads!
::'''Nimrod:''' I never want to feel something like Stormterror passing overhead ever again!
::'''Nimrod:''' Please, Knights of Favonius, do something!
:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Nimrod:''' While the concrete losses weren't heavy, I'm still shaking right now.
::'''Nimrod:''' You can laugh if you want, but I really thought we were done for back there.
::'''Nimrod:''' Never mind not being able to drink. As long as my wife [[Eury]] was safe, I thought then, I would be alright even if I never drank another drop again in my life!
::'''Nimrod:''' Ahem... But since all's well now, I suppose we shouldn't take such rash words too seriously, eh? Hahaha...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Nimrod:''' Is that a trick question? I'm on my way to have a drink.
::'''Nimrod:''' Ooh, er... Oh it's fine, I don't think my wife will have overheard that.
::'''Nimrod:''' So I actually had to sneak out to buy some wine... *sigh* How can you deny a Mondstadter the right to drink...
::'''Nimrod:''' When even one of the [[Four Drunkards]] is a woman, how can my wife be so narrow-minded.
::{{DIcon}} Who are the Four Drunkards?
::'''Nimrod:''' You wanna know more about them, eh? Hehehe... Why, they are nothing short of legends in Mondstadt, on a par with the Knights of Favonius' Grand Master [[Varka]]...
::'''Nimrod:''' ...I can see you're only pretending to follow. Are you from out of town? No wonder you haven't heard.
::'''Nimrod:''' There's no point giving you their real names then, but I'll give you their nicknames and see if you can figure it out...
::'''Nimrod:''' They are [[Quinn|Sir Dullwits the Oblivious Merchant]], [[Margaret|Dame Workshy the Absentee Boss]], [[Draff|Oddears the Incredible Hunter]] and [[Jack|Rookie McSchoolboy the Inexperienced Adventurer]].
::'''Nimrod:''' Should be pretty obvious by now, huh? Hehehe, talk to you later!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nimrod:''' Bye-bye! May your glass forever flow with the fine wine of good fortune!
{{Dialogue end}}
