|text1    = An apex predator deep in the desert that can use the power of Anemo to a certain extent, which allows it to leave the ground when in combat and enter a floating state. While floating, it can fire Windbite Bullets. If these bullets are not destroyed in time, they will be converted into a high-density curtain of such bullets. {{Color|help|Attacks from elements that may react with Anemo}} can destroy Windbite Bullets, which temporarily decrease the corresponding Elemental RES of the Setekh Wenut. After 2 Windbite Bullets are destroyed in succession, the Setekh Wenut will be brought down from its floating state.
