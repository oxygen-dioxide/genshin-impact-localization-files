;今天是甘雨的生日哦，我们快去为她庆祝吧！
:'''瑶瑶：'''没想到在这里碰到了甘雨姐姐。
:'''甘雨：'''唔，原本是因为工作外出的，不小心就在这里睡着了…
:'''旅行者：'''不着急回去的话，要不要坐一会儿？
:'''派蒙：'''今天的阳光很舒服，气温也正好，我和旅行者就出来闲逛啦。
:'''瑶瑶：'''我晒了一些清心叶子，要不要泡茶试试？喜欢的话可以带回去哦，对身体好的。
:'''甘雨：'''之前瑶瑶给我送过，旅行者和派蒙多拿一些吧。
:'''派蒙：'''这个真的好吃嘛？甘雨提过好几次，要不要试试呢…
:'''旅行者：'''等等，不是直接吃呀。

;Today is [[Ganyu]]'s birthday, let's go and celebrate with her!
:'''[[Yaoyao]]:''' I didn't expect to bump into Ganyu here.
:'''Ganyu:''' Ah, I initially had to travel for work today, but I accidentally fell asleep...
:'''Traveler:''' If you're not in a rush to get back, would you like to join us for a while?
:'''Paimon:''' The sun is beautiful today, and the weather's just nice, so we both came out for a stroll.
:'''Yaoyao:''' I have some [[Qingxin]] leaves I dried myself. Should we try to brew some tea? If you like it, you can bring it home! It's very nutritious.
:'''Ganyu:''' Yaoyao already gave me some last time, so you two can have as much as you want.
:'''Paimon:''' Are these leaves really that tasty? Ganyu's mentioned them a few times before. Paimon kinda wants to try them now...
:'''Traveler:''' Hold on, you can't just eat that on its own.
