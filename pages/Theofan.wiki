'''Theofan''' was a [[Fatui]] delegate to [[Liyue]] and [[Yusupov]]'s second-in-command. While he has not been seen in-person, he plays a crucial role at the end of [[Yelan]]'s Story Quest, Act I: [[Calculated Gambit]].

==Profile==
Despite serving as Yusupov's subordinate, Theofan coveted Yusupov's position for himself. When [[Zhiyi]], whom Yusupov saw as a mere pawn for getting a Fatui collaborator within the [[Liyue Qixing]]'s ranks, sought to shake off the Fatui's control over him by assassinating Yusupov and then covering up any evidence of their collaboration, Theofan assisted by providing Zhiyi with extra poison to use on his superior.

Zhiyi and Yusupov's plots were foiled by [[Yelan]] and the [[Traveler]]. Yelan attempted to use the information she gathered to get Theofan in her clutches and use him against the Fatui, but by the time she attempted to apprehend him, she discovered that the [[Harbinger]] "Regrator" [[Pantalone]] had already recalled Theofan to safety.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Foregone Conclusion}}</ref>
