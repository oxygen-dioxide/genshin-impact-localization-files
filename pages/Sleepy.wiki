==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sleepy:''' Hold on a second, I don't know you... Why would you come up and start making conversation with me? It's bad manners!
:{{DIcon}} ...Is it?
::'''Sleepy:''' Can't you see I'm at my post? If you want to make conversation, you should tell me first!
::{{DIcon}} Doesn't telling you count as part of the conversation?
::'''Sleepy:''' If that were the case, you should at least know to give me a heads up before telling me you want to make conversation... Honestly...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for inconveniencing you.
::'''Sleepy:''' Apology accepted! I appreciate it! Have a wonderful day!
