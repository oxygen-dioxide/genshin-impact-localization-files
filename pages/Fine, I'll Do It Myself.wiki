'''''Fine, I'll Do It Myself''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat a [[Primo Geovishap]] without reflecting its Primordial Shower.

==Trivia==
* The name of the achievement is likely a reference to the movie {{w|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}, in which Thanos says [https://youtu.be/L_WoOkDAqbM "Fine, I'll do it myself"] while retrieving the Infinity Gauntlet. This could be due to either the Primo Geovishap's bulky physique & craggy jawline resembling Thanos', its "Elemental-Infused Stones" gimmick's similarity to the Infinity Stones, or both.
