'''''A Gentleman Strikes in Broad Daylight''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] that can occur in various parts of [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|Some scoundrels are plotting ill, threatening the safety of the surrounding area. If you can sneak into their encampment and filch their supplies, you are sure to greatly reduce their strength.}}
#Complete the quest by filching the supplies (0/1)
##Take 2 supplies (0/2 supplies collected)
#*While Step 1 says (0/1), the sub-objective "Take 2 supplies" will be displayed on the [[screen]] after approaching the area.
#*This step is completed after stealing the supplies. It is possible to stealthily snatch the supplies without the enemies' notice, or by defeating all enemies first and then taking the supplies after they are defeated.
#Withdraw to a safe area after taking the supplies

==Gameplay Notes==
* After being spotted, more enemies will spawn and the game will display a message stating "You have been discovered by the enemy!"
** It is not possible to steal the supplies while fighting enemies.
** Being spotted after obtaining the supplies will still cause reinforcements to spawn, but the enemies do not need to be defeated before finishing the commission.
* Despawning enemies by teleporting or walking very far away during the commission will reset it completely, despawning any reinforcements and resetting supplies obtained.
** It is also possible to walk far enough away to lose aggro '''without''' resetting the commission or respawning enemies; afterwards, it will be possible to return to the commission area and stealthily take any remaining supplies. (There is little practical benefit to doing this, though; it will usually be easier to either defeat all the enemies or simply reset the commission.)
* Enemies from this commission do not drop EXP, items, or Mora.
