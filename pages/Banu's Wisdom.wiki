|description  = In some cosmological settings, this is a staff filled with mystical power. It can resonate with the Future Stars and show the way to them.<br />Of course, in some other settings, it might be an object kept in storage by an organization known as the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]], and perhaps its recorded name might even be [[Ayesha's Chaos Prospector]]. There is a thin layer of dust over this object due to a long period of disuse.
