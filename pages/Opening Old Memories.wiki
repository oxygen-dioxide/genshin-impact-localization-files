'''Opening Old Memories''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Tsurumi Island]]. It requires the [[Peculiar Pinion (Gadget)]] obtained from Step 3 of the {{Quest|Octave of the Maushiro}}.

==Steps==
Use the Peculiar Pinion near the following walls with a carving of [[Kanna Kapatcir]] on them, in any order:

# Drop down to the bottom of [[Shirikoro Peak]]. Head to the tunnel to the northeast. The tunnel will turn to the right and into an open space, with the mural on the right. The room behind the mural has a guarded chest containing a [[Star-Shaped Gem]].

# From the room above, go through the circular door (solve the puzzle for this to open.) The next mural is on the left wall of the lower lever directly in front of the circular door. Run through and drop down. The mural is on the left. There is an [[Electroculus]] inside. There are a couple of [[Ruin Machines]] in the area as well.

# This mural is in the same room as #1 above. It is on the wall directly opposite of the circular door. There is a chest inside with a [[Star-Shaped Gem]]. Opening the chest will activate the mechanical opponent near the mural.

# When leaving mural room #3, turn to the left and move into the next room. A set of stairs will lead down to the left. Go through the circular doorway. The mural is on the wall directly in front. Once the wall is opened, go through and turn right. This will lead into an area with a puzzle. Look up and a hole can be seen in the ceiling. A chest with a [[Star-Shaped Gem]] is up there.
