:'''Huatli:''' Hello there. Um... What time is it now? Noon? Or evening?
:{{DIcon}} Err, are you alright?
::'''Huatli:''' Sorry, sorry, let me have a look around first. Oh, boy. So it's this late, huh?
::'''Huatli:''' *cough* Don't worry, I'm fully awake now! I&mdash;I was just meditating back there, that's all!
::'''Huatli:''' I love the sky. The positions of the sun, the moon, and the stars... They aren't just randomly scattered like [[Grainfruit]] in soup.
::'''Huatli:''' Of course, I've also heard that some people like to divine fortunes with leftover tea leaves or coffee residue, but... Hehe, well, sounds like child's play to me.
::{{DIcon}} At least tea and coffee taste good, right?
::'''Huatli:''' Oh sure, that they do, and I love them too. Great way to jolt yourself awake.
::'''Huatli:''' Ah... *yawn* Speaking of which, I'm getting sleepy again...
::'''Huatli:''' Wait, no. I mean, I should go meditate again. Let's chat again when we get the chance, alright? See you!
:{{DIcon}} Look up at the sky.
::'''Huatli:''' Ah, right, yes. The skies tell all.
