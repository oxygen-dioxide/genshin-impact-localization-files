==Puzzles==
===Three Cranes Puzzle===
From Qingyun Peak's waypoint, walk up the stone steps to reach the monument at the top. The description reads:

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Read:''' "The one who may ascend is the one who {{Color|buzzword|kowtows atop the three mountains}}. The sun, moon, and stars shall each shine, and auspicious signs shall be sent by the {{Color|buzzword|three divine birds}}."
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... It's a real headache trying to make sense of the adepti and all this other stuff in Liyue.
:'''Paimon:''' This must mean we have to find three shining birds on top of three mountains right?
{{Dialogue End}}

#If you "Observe Strange Light", light trails will appear, directing you to the crane statue. From the peak, the crane statues will also visibly sparkle.
#:{{Dialogue Start}}'''Paimon:''' Paimon can tell something happened here, but not sure what exactly... Let's make use of the great view here and look around.{{Dialogue End}}
#At each crane statue, "Rotate" them until they are facing the monument. When the statues are in their correct positions, a cutscene will occur.
#After all three cranes are correctly positioned, return to the monument and "Activate" it. This creates a wind current; jumping up reveals three plaustrite platform steps and another wind current, which then reveals another four steps before reaching the Dwelling in the Clouds.

Reaching the "[[Dwelling in the Clouds]]" grants the {{Achievement|Overlooking View}} as well as two Precious Chests amd one Luxurious Chest.
