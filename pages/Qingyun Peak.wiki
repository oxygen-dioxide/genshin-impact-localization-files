{{Dialogue end}}
:*Another stone tablet can be found near the Plaustrite steps leading up to the Three Cranes Puzzle. It reads:
{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Read:''' Moon Carver, disciple of [[Rex Lapis]]. The kindest adeptus amongst all, in the manifestation of a stag.
{{Dialogue end}}
:*Another stone tablet can be found along the winding path east of Qingyun Peak where the [[No Honor Among Thieves#Qingyun Peak|Qingyun Peak version]] of No Honor Among Thieves takes place. It reads:
{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Read:''' "At the southernmost point is a shortcut, a meandering mountain road. Those who seek mysteries hidden in the clouds, watch the seas' tides above and below."
{{Dialogue end}}

*Mysterious Barrier
:*An Unknown Adeptis' Abode can be found located in the region as well, interacting with it reads:
{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Mysterious Barrier:''' Jueyun Karst is where the adepti dwell, so perhaps this is the abode of one. But there seems to be no way to enter...

==Puzzles==
===Three Cranes Puzzle===
From Qingyun Peak's waypoint, walk up the stone steps to reach the monument at the top. The description reads:

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Read:''' "The one who may ascend is the one who {{Color|buzzword|kowtows atop the three mountains}}. The sun, moon, and stars shall each shine, and auspicious signs shall be sent by the {{Color|buzzword|three divine birds}}."
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... It's a real headache trying to make sense of the adepti and all this other stuff in Liyue.
:'''Paimon:''' This must mean we have to find three shining birds on top of three mountains right?
{{Dialogue end}}

#If you "Observe Strange Light", light trails will appear, directing you to the crane statue. From the peak, the crane statues will also visibly sparkle.
#:{{Dialogue start}}'''Paimon:''' Paimon can tell something happened here, but not sure what exactly... Let's make use of the great view here and look around.{{Dialogue end}}
#At each crane statue, "Rotate" them until they are facing the monument. When the statues are in their correct positions, a cutscene will occur.
#After all three cranes are correctly positioned, return to the monument and "Activate" it. This creates a wind current; jumping up reveals three plaustrite platform steps and another wind current, which then reveals another four steps before reaching the Dwelling in the Clouds.

====Dwelling in the Clouds====
Above the Qingyun Peak's waypoint, activated by the Three Cranes Puzzle, is a floating island on a nest of stone clouds. Reaching this island will give the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Overlooking View]]." The description of the island is as follows:

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Read:''' "This place above the clouds is built on a foundation of Plaustrite, one of the marvels of the world. Its original purpose was to serve as my private sanctuary, somewhere where I could get away from the world and escape the highs and lows of normal life.
:'''Read:''' Then the adepti took over the place as somewhere they could focus on seeking ultimate truth in seclusion. Now that [[Taishan Mansion]] is sealed off, they finally returned the place to me.
:'''Read:''' It's great to have it back, but I'm over it now. I want to go back to the world for a bit &mdash; I'll probably start with [[Guili Plains]]. Fitting, really &mdash; a round trip to the Plains of Returning and Departing, as they're also known... Hover around for a while, then hover away on a hovering stone... Heh."
{{Dialogue end}}

During the World Quest [[An Adeptal Summons]], Cloud Retainer reveals that she created this floating island. The [["Dwelling in the Clouds" Blueprints]] will be found on the ground during the quest.
