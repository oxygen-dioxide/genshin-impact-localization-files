==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bhai:''' Are all [[Mondstadt]]ers so sentimental?
:'''Bhai:''' If you ask me, it's better to focus on what's going on around you. That's how you should live!
:{{DIcon}} Mondstadter?
::'''Bhai:''' The old man over there, who is constantly murmuring, "May the [[Anemo Archon]] bless us."
::'''Bhai:''' I don't have anything against the Anemo Archon but I think the old man is trapped in the wind, he's going nowhere.
::'''Bhai:''' His wife was a smart and capable captain of a merchant fleet, and I was her chief mate.
::'''Bhai:''' *sigh* If she saw that old guy behaving like this, she'd rise from the ground and slap him right on the head!
::{{DIcon}} You don't like him?
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
::'''Bhai:''' Honestly, I don't hate him at all. When he was young, he was passionate and talkative. He knew a great deal about poetry and singing, which was quite enviable.
::'''Bhai:''' But now, his attitude is really driving me nuts. He could've done so much better than this!
::'''Bhai:''' While you're alive, you could cherish what you have and live in the present instead of trapping yourself in the past.
::'''Bhai:''' Old memories should be the nutrient of new life, not shackles keeping you in the endless loop of pain.
::'''Bhai:''' The Greater Lord is a perfect example of this. She might have passed away, but what she left behind will nourish Sumeru for generations.
::'''Bhai:''' This old thing has lived in Sumeru for so long yet still doesn't understand this. He hasn't learned a thing from her!
::{{DIcon}} So you don't like him?
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::'''Bhai:''' Honestly, I don't hate him at all. When he was young, he was passionate and talkative. He knew a great deal about poetry and singing, and I found that quite enviable.
::'''Bhai:''' But now, his attitude is really driving me nuts. He could've done so much better than this!
::'''Bhai:''' Shouldn't we who are alive cherish what we have and live in the present instead of trapping ourselves in the past?
::'''Bhai:''' Old memories should nourish new life instead of becoming shackles that keep you in an endless loop of pain.
::'''Bhai:''' I mean, the Dendro Archon may have lost much of her power, but that lost power became the nutrients required to save the world!
::'''Bhai:''' That crusty old fellow has lived in Sumeru for so long, and yet, he doesn't understand this. He hasn't learned a thing from her at all!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Cherish what I have...
:::'''Bhai:''' When I was young, I used to travel around with the fleet, which taught me to cherish every drop of water and every flower.
:::'''Bhai:''' The surging waves, the soaring seagulls, or the swaying seaweed on the shores are all testaments to life.
:::'''Bhai:''' You'll understand that when you get to see as much as I have. Don't follow in that old fogey's footsteps!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Adventurer's Experience|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Bhai:''' Never let any beautiful moments go amiss!
