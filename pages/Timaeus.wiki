==Profile==
Timaeus is a scholar of alchemy. While [[Albedo]] has a somewhat low opinion on his skills, he nonetheless continues to help him advance in the art. Timaeus is well aware that his skill pales in comparison to him and [[Sucrose]], but nonetheless dedicates himself to spreading the knowledge of alchemy in Mondstadt.

Timaeus eventually came upon what was called a "Smoldersleet Elixir" and asked the Traveler and Paimon to help him find the formula for it. They were taken to [[Liyue]], where Timaeus met [[Ying'er]], who was responsible for its creation. However, he was dismayed to find that it was only used for cosmetic purposes, although Ying'er helped him out in the creation process and made the "Smoldersleet Potion." He then tasked the Traveler with testing it on his behalf as he continued to talk with Ying'er. Timaeus later published a paper on the Smoldersleet Potion titled "Combat Environment Changes Made by the Spread of Aerolized Liquid Potions."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Cliffside Weirdo and a Risky Study?}}</ref>

===Personality===
Timaeus has a tendency to take sentences thoroughly, word by word, especially when reading instructions. He also wishes to prove his own skills and make something unique, expressing admiration towards Albedo's skills and envy towards Sucrose gaining his appreciation. While he is aware that Sucrose is more skilled than him, he questions the practical use of the creations she makes.

===Appearance===
A Brown haired man wearing leathered vest and leathered boots.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Timaeus:''' Hi there, are you also interested in alchemy?
:{{DIcon|Alchemy}} I'd like to use the Crafting Bench.
::'''Timaeus:''' Sure, please go ahead.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge

:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Timaeus:''' A victory, just as I expected.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Timaeus:''' Oh no. Where did I go wrong?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Timaeus:''' I am Timaeus, an alchemy scholar. You may not have heard that name before...
::'''Timaeus:''' But I'll bet you'll have heard the names [[Albedo]] and [[Sucrose]] before.
::'''Timaeus:''' Albedo is nothing short of a genius in the field of alchemy. And his assistant, Sucrose, is extremely talented for her age.
::'''Timaeus:''' I'm a total amateur compared to them.
::{{DIcon}} About Albedo...
:::'''Timaeus:''' Albedo is an alchemy prodigy. A lot of people call him the Kreideprinz. He's the top alchemical talent in Mondstadt.
:::'''Timaeus:''' They say he's an outlander who just showed up in Mondstadt one day and was instantly taken on as Chief Alchemist by the [[Knights of Favonius]]. He's also Captain of the Investigation Team.
:::'''Timaeus:''' His alchemical theory is refreshingly unbridled in comparison to conventional theories. In practice it all works out too.
:::'''Timaeus:''' In my eyes my work must seem like child's play... *sigh*
::{{DIcon}} About Sucrose...
:::'''Timaeus:''' Sucrose is Albedo's only assistant. She's so lucky to have gained Albedo's appreciation.
:::'''Timaeus:''' As a born and bred child of Mondstadt, we should be proud of Sucrose's contributions to alchemy.
:::'''Timaeus:''' But her research and interests are a little... antiquated, to the point that they rarely render any practical application.
:::'''Timaeus:''' *sigh* If I had access to such a plethora of resources, who knows what I could accomplish.
:{{DIcon}} Alchemy?
::'''Timaeus:''' Alchemy is a craft that has been passed down since ancient times, but it is barely understood in the present.
::'''Timaeus:''' Its mechanisms are magical and mysterious, completely unlike the principles that shape our understanding of the physical world.
::'''Timaeus:''' If I can get the hang of it, I should be able to create some pretty awesome stuff, and contribute to our knowledge of ancient civilization.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds complicated.
:::'''Timaeus:''' Its not that bad, the procedure is actually very simple. If you're interested, I can show you the basics?
:::'''Timaeus:''' Much as one who uses a [[Wind Glider|wind glider]] needs not understand how it was built in order to glide.
:::'''Timaeus:''' The process is mesmerizing to witness. I'm confident you'll be singling the praise of ancient civilizations and their ingenuity after you've tried it for yourself.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} How's your research coming along?
:::'''Timaeus:''' Not too bad, although I haven't had the best of luck recently... My clock is a few minutes too slow, and thanks to that, a whole load of experiments have failed dismally...
:::'''Timaeus:''' It's not much use for keeping time anymore, that's for sure...
:::'''Timaeus:''' But after being sued in so many alchemical experiments, it seems to have gained some understanding of the basic makeup and functional principles of the world... Maybe it's undergone some sort of miraculous transformation.
:::'''Timaeus:''' Why don't you take it? Maybe it'll come in handy in your adventures.
::;(Obtain [[Scholar]]'s Clock ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Timaeus:''' Bye then, I'll carry on with my research.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Archive]] description for [[Cryo Specter]]s, Timaeus is the "certain alchemist" who studied them and came to the conclusion that they were related to either Slimes or the Traveler, only to be reprimanded by his teacher, Albedo. This is a reference to the quest ''[[The First Experiment: Elements]]'', where Timaeus hypothesized that the Traveler was a type of Slime, only for the notion to be quickly rejected by Albedo.

===Etymology===
* Timaeus' name likely derives from {{w|Timaeus of Locri}}, a character in Plato's dialogues who, in his {{w|Timaeus (dialogue)|dialogue}}, speculates on the nature of the physical world and human beings.
** Albedo pronounces Timaeus as "Timayus" while Timaeus of Locri is pronounced "Tyemeeus."
