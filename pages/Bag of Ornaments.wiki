|description  = A bag of decorations that [[Old Chou]] gave you as compensation for [[Tang Wuchou]]'s misfortunes. They are very roughly made, owing to having been manufactured by the [[Treasure Hoarders]] within [[The Chasm]] using smuggled ore, and can barely be considered to possess any aesthetic qualities at all. As such, there is no hope at all of them selling well in Liyue. The only thing good you could say about these ornaments is that they are at least made using the right materials...
