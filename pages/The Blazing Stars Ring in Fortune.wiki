{{Dialogue start}}
;(Enter Liyue Harbor)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who would've guessed that rebuilding the [[Jade Chamber]] would draw out such a massive monster!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For a second there, Paimon really thought the Jade Chamber was gonna be ruined again...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, but it's all over now... who knows if the Lantern Rite can still go on after an incident like that, though.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's ask Lady Ningguang how things are shaping up for the festival this year, (Traveler).

----

;(Approach Ningguang at the Yujing Terrace)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' ...Send this report to the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] and have them delegate each of the tasks on the list to the appropriate departments.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Also, be sure to tell them that though the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]] may be complicated, everything must be done properly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello, Lady Ningguang! It's us again!
:{{DIcon}} We're not disturbing you, are we?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' No, of course not. You are my honored guests.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' And given the looks of you two, I presume that you are here to celebrate the Lantern Rite?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! So what's on the agenda for the festival this year?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' As always, there will be a variety of activities taking place. Oh, but there is one of particular interest... The Ministry of Civil Affairs is planning a fireworks show this year. It should certainly be worth your time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 14.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Releasing Mingxiao Lanterns has always been at the heart of the Lantern Rite, but with all that has occurred in Liyue as of late, I think the people of the city need something to warm their hearts, a feeling of everyone coming together in solidarity.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 15.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' So, I believe that this year calls for a celebration of particular magnificence, something that would be closer to the hearts of every citizen.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 16.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' We are currently in the process of placing fireworks at various locations all throughout Liyue. We shall choose a timely moment during the festival to set off all the fireworks in unison, allowing the sparkling lights and excitement to resonate with the hearts of the people.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fireworks? But we've already seen fireworks in other places before.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is there something special about the fireworks in Liyue?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Fireworks were originally developed alongside many other inventions here in Liyue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' When our ancestors first created fireworks, they were originally known as "firecrackers." Their bright flashes and loud sounds were often used for warding off beasts or as warning signals to other people.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 08.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' In those days, it was difficult for people to contact one another while out farming the land, so they would carry firecrackers with them to give signals when necessary.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 09.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' But people's lifestyles began to change after [[Liyue Harbor]] was founded. They no longer had to travel out of town to tend the fields anymore, so the use of firecrackers for emergencies also began to dwindle.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 10.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' But through our local customs, the pioneering spirit of the firecrackers has been passed down to this very day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 11.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' We made improvements to firecrackers and began setting them off during the Lantern Rite to commemorate the tenacious spirit of our ancestors.
:{{DIcon}} Classic Liyue...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, everything has so much history in Liyue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 12.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' As I am sure you already know, everything on this land accumulates history and value as time passes. That is the nature of Liyue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 2 ningguang 13.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I've left [[Keqing]] in charge of the fireworks show. If you're interested, why don't we pay her a visit together?

----
;(Approach the fireworks stall)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm, we need to add a few more locations for launching fireworks. The show has to be visible all across Liyue, not just in the city. They celebrate Lantern Rite in [[Qingce Village]] too, you know.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 01.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' B&mdash;But Lady Keqing, what about our budget...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The budget is exactly what it's meant to be. It's the necessary amount of funds to properly carry out a task.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If you think the current budget will not suffice, then we'll simply have to apply for more funding from the Ministry of Civil Affairs and wait for their approval.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Our aim is to organize a memorable Lantern Rite. The budget is there just to facilitate planning, we mustn't lose sight of our goal.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 02.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Yes, Lady Keqing. I understand.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Good, and please remember, safety first.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh, it's Ningguang and the Traveler! Good to see you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Are you here for the Lantern Rite? Your timing couldn't be any better, the preparations are almost complete.
:{{DIcon}} What are you working on, Keqing?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'm reviewing the positioning of the fireworks and double-checking the relevant facilities... It's all in a day's work.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Forgive my directness, but if I'm not mistaken, you could just as easily leave these tasks to your subordinates. You've already been working around the clock these past few days, I'm sure a break would not be amiss.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' No, it's fine. Really, I can handle it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' [[Pengyi]], please redraft our plans, make a summary report, and send it to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'm going into town to check the progress of the fireworks setup. I'll return shortly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' As for you, Traveler, you're our esteemed guest. Please take the opportunity to stay in Liyue Harbor and enjoy the festivities.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Pengyi, is everything clear? Please remember the tasks I've given you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 03.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Yes, Lady Keqing! Don't worry.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Good. Ningguang, Traveler, goodbye for now.
;(Keqing leaves)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 04.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Please excuse me, Lady Ningguang, and uh... Traveler, I must get going.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 05.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Lady Keqing told me a great deal of information, and I have to write up the plans from scratch again, so time is of the essence.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 06.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Ooh! One moment, I almost forgot!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 07.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Here, Traveler, this is a [[Launch Tube]]. Lady Keqing said you may be interested, so she had me keep one to give to you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 pengyi 08.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Someone with good handicraft skills should be able to use this to design their very own fireworks. You should try it when you have the chance!
;(Pengyi leaves)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, Paimon couldn't get a single word in just now...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, well, more like Paimon didn't dare open her mouth while they were talking, but still!
:{{DIcon}} Keqing definitely had an imposing presence...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you notice it too? Lady Keqing is a lot more outspoken than she used to be!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And she seems a whole lot busier, too. Wonder why...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Ever since the adepti left Liyue Harbor in the hands of mortals, we [[Qixing]] have taken up the responsibility of leading the people.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' We have taken charge of many vital tasks in various sectors, and we are responsible for planning and organizing all sorts of affairs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' That said, being in charge of everything inevitably takes its toll. It's exhausting at times.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' [[Jiangzhou]] was responsible for planning the Lantern Rite in former years, but her father is getting quite old now, so she transferred to another department this year.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' In the end, the Lantern Rite planning was left to Keqing and myself. I am the head organizer, while Keqing is responsible for the highly anticipated fireworks show.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Such an important event should be entrusted to the most qualified candidate. Keqing is disciplined, yet passionate about her work, so she's naturally the best fit for the job.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's definitely disciplined... no doubt about that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 08.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Absolutely. She is strict with both herself and others, to the point that she can even become overly involved at times. She's worked several days without a break now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 09.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I'm concerned about the effects it may have in the long run.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 10.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Finding balance is an essential concept in Liyue culture.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 11.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I've tried talking to her, but you know how she is... She uses her wit to talk circles around anyone...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 12.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Traveler, you are quite close to Keqing, why don't you try talking to her? Maybe she'd listen to someone as experienced as you.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} I'll think of something.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 13.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Thank you, Traveler. I am glad you are able to help. Keqing can be a tough nut to crack, sometimes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 ningguang 14.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I still have other business to attend to at the Jade Chamber. I'll leave Keqing in your capable hands.

:'''Ningguang leaves.'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, are you sure you can really persuade Keqing to take a break? Even Ningguang herself couldn't manage to convince her...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Besides, before you can persuade someone, you have to at least understand how they feel at the moment.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Keqing has been working non-stop without a break.
:{{DIcon}} So she must feel... very tired?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Duh! C'mon, everyone knows that! Think harder, how does she feel deep, deep down inside?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm, or maybe... we could ask a friend. You know, someone more knowledgeable about these things?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go talk to Zhongli, then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Zhongli?
:{{DIcon}} He's really knowledgeable about the people of Liyue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, there's no arguing that! Zhongli it is, then!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks he's still a consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Let's go see if he's there!

;(Talk to the Ferrylady)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 01.ogg}} '''Ferrylady:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 02.ogg}} '''Ferrylady:''' Hello, how may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} We're looking for your consultant, Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 03.ogg}} '''Ferrylady:''' Ah, yes... Well, I'm afraid he is currently out with the director.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Out with the director? You mean, for work?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 04.ogg}} '''Ferrylady:''' The director said that they were going for a walk.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 05.ogg}} '''Ferrylady:''' If you'd prefer, you could go look for them at Third-Round Knockout.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 4 ferrylady 06.ogg}} '''Ferrylady:''' I've heard the director often goes there to do... uh, promotion.

;(Talk to the Ferrylady again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj101 ferrylady 01.ogg}} '''Ferrylady:''' If you're looking for the director and our consultant, you can go look for them at Third-Round Knockout. I've heard the director often goes there to do... uh, promotion.

;(Approach Third-Round Knockout)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Yum... Whew, I'm so full, not another bite!
:{{Introductory Note|character=Hu Tao}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 gooba 03.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hats off to you, Xiangling, serving the grilled fish with a dipping sauce is quite an innovative approach, the flavor is just to die for!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee, that's my signature dipping sauce. I knew it would taste great!
:{{Introductory Note|character=Xiangling}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hmm. Tempered [[Jueyun Chili]] powder mixed with garlic paste and chopped scallions... Then seasoned with salt, vinegar, and soy sauce, before finally sizzling in hot oil.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This recipe may seem a bit crude, but is entirely hinged on the precise balancing of flavors and seasonings by the chef. Everything must be balanced just right.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It is the consummate mastery of this balance that turns a humble dish into an exquisite one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 10.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oooh! That's quite the compliment, don't you think?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee... I am flattered. Thank you, Mr. Zhongli!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 11.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' And I thought I have a way with words, but you certainly take the prize, Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 23.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You are too kind, Director. Your eloquence is *ahem* infamous in Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 gooba 01.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪~♪~
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 12.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' What's that? Would you like to order something, Guoba? Please, by all means, it's my treat! I'll just open a tab under "Xiangling"!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 gooba 02.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, are you guys talking about tasty food again?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh! It's the Traveler and Paimon! What brings you to this side of town?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hold on! Let me take a wild guess. Hmm, yes... Oh, you must be here for the Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, isn't that pretty obvious? Anybody could have guessed that!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Aiya, c'mon! Can't you take a joke!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' You came at the perfect time, I was just letting everyone try my latest dish!

:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't have to ask Paimon twice! Or once, even!
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, but we're here to see Mr. Zhongli.

:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' We meet again, Traveler. I trust your journey is going well?
:{{DIcon}} Not bad, we've learned a lot along the way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Splendid, therein lies the value of a journey.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' So, c'mon! Why are you looking for our good consultant? Do enlighten us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' And just in case you were wondering, we are on business, too! We only tried Xiangling's dish since we just happened to be here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Business? What kind of business would the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor possibly have during a festival?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Even during the most joyous of holidays, life still follows its natural course, does it not? Is that really so surprising? But there isn't need to be alarmed, it's just a nice day today and I thought we could go for a walk while doing a little promotion for our business.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' You can go ahead and chat away. Xiangling and I will go have some tea with the boss over there. Zhongli, please come get me when you're through here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Of course, I'll see you later, Director.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Now then, Traveler, what brings you to see me today?
:{{DIcon}} Well, long story short...

:'''''You explain Keqing's situation to Zhongli.'''''

:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hmm, yes. The Yuheng is honest, intelligent, and most diligent. She is capable of shouldering responsibilities that few others could, but everything has a balance, and one's health must certainly weigh in.
:{{DIcon}} Is there any way we can help her?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. Everyone knows you're super knowledgeable, Paimon bets she would listen to someone like you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If I were still the mighty Rex Lapis, I might be able to help her see reason. But alas, I'm now nobody but an ordinary consultant. My words no longer carry the same weight as they once did.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Besides, I am by no means close to the Yuheng. Taking the liberty to lecture her may just as easily produce the opposite of the desired effect.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you're right... Then what should we do?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' We could take a more subtle, indirect approach to the matter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Such as telling a story that resonates with her, containing your message conveyed within it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Such a story can be achieved by referencing topics from her daily life. The story could prove even more effective if you weave in something about someone close to her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm, Paimon doesn't really get it...
:{{DIcon}} Let's go speak with others who are familiar with Keqing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I knew you'd understand what to do, haha. Well done, Traveler.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Go collect some source materials for your story. Of course, I can always provide you with my advice, if needed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Once we have formulated the plot, you can tell the story to the Yuheng.
:{{DIcon}} Huh? Me?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You are on amiable terms with the Yuheng, which makes you the natural candidate.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it! So we need to talk with people who know Keqing, right? Hmm, so who should we start with?
;(Keqing arrives)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Greetings everyone, I hope I'm not intruding.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh, L&mdash;Lady Keqing!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Mr. Zhongli, I didn't expect to see you here. Thank you for all your assistance during the [[Rite of Parting]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You are most welcome, Yuheng. It was the least I could do.
:{{DIcon}} Erm, what are you doing here, Keqing?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm, why? And what's with your strange expression?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh, I see, my apologies, I appear to have interrupted your conversation with Mr. Zhongli.
:{{DIcon}} No, no, not at all.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Keqing, are you here looking for us?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes, I was going to ask you to introduce me to the adepti. I thought that it would be fitting to send them some festive gifts on behalf of the Liyue Qixing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But didn't you meet them when we were fighting to defend Liyue Harbor together?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You could just as easily go and find them in [[Jueyun Karst]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes, but we only met briefly on that single occasion. The adepti may have already forgotten about me, and I'm concerned it would be imprudent to show up so suddenly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Which is why I thought it would be more appropriate to ask you to introduce me first.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, no problem.
:{{DIcon}} Did you try asking [[Ganyu]]?
::{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 08b 1.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Unfortunately, Ganyu is on leave at the moment, so I'm unable to get in touch with her.
::{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 08b 2.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'm afraid I'll still require your assistance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you even have to run around delivering gifts in person... It sure doesn't seem easy to be a Qixing.
:{{DIcon}} We'll gladly help you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Thank you, Traveler. Let me go and prepare the gifts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'm sorry to make you run errands with me during our big festival. I promise to make this quick, and I'll be sure to get you back in time to enjoy the fireworks show.
:{{DIcon}} Great, then we go watch the fireworks together!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Huh? T&mdash;Together?
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm, alright. I'll go to see the fireworks with you once I've finished my work.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Speaking of which, Mr. Zhongli, the Fireworks Show will be particularly exciting this year. Please, don't miss it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, yes. Thank you for your kind reminder.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I should be going now. Traveler, please come find me at the Jade Chamber once you're ready.
;(Keqing leaves)
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And there she goes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That's the Yuheng, efficient and reliable as ever.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're really reliable too, Zhongli!
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 21.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Why, thank you, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj101 6 zhongli 22.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Please don't forget our earlier conversation. Once you've collected enough story material, we can meet here again and discuss things further.

:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh! Hey, (Traveler)! Happy Lantern Rite!
:{{DIcon}} ...Are you alright?
::{{A|vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 03a.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Could be worse, could be worse! Festivals are always a little busy, you know how it is.
:{{DIcon}} How's Guoba these days?
::{{A|vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 03b.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hehe, aw, thanks for asking! Well, neither the stove nor the atmosphere are dying down any time soon, so Guoba's as happy as can be.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 5 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' If you're craving anything off the Wanmin menu, don't worry about being a burden. However busy it gets, I'll always make time to cook for you.

:{{DIcon}} Just came here to see you.
:{{DIcon}} Just here to chat with you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 4 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, I see! So you just missed me all of a sudden? Oh, you &mdash; why'd you have to go and be so thoughtful, hmm? I couldn't possibly bring myself to scare you with a ghost story now!
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 4 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' To tell the truth, this Lantern Rite's been a busy one for me. I got Xiangling to give me a few recipes and I've been trying my hand at them. Since you're here, why don't you have a taste...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 4 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Wh&mdash;What's that look for!? ... You're not leaving already are you? C'mon, don't go &mdash; I promise they don't taste that bad! And I promise, it's not a prank!

:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Traveler, it seems Liyue has a way of drawing you back every once in a while. Do you miss it here?

::{{A|vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 03a.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Is that so? I am delighted to hear it.

:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 1 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' The preparations were very lengthy this time. I don't know if it is to everyone's tastes, but I, for one, am most satisfied with the way it has turned out.
