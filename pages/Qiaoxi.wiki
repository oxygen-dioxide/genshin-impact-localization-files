==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Qiaoxi:''' Normally, everyone who wishes to cross this bridge is subject to interrogation.
:'''Qiaoxi:''' I spy a traveler in exotic attire... What are you doing here?
:{{DIcon}} Exotic attire?
::'''Qiaoxi:''' Yes. You're dressed very ostentatiously indeed... So you're definitely not someone to worry about.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' Think about it. Criminals would want to dress as discreetly as possible, no?
::'''Qiaoxi:''' That's based on my experience guarding this bridge, in any case.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your work.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' As long as this bridge is here, someone needs to guard it! We can't afford to let our guard down, not for one second.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' The bridge is a major thoroughfare. So to be handed the job of guarding it is the highest recognition I could ask for.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' I will never let our enemies have their way, even if it costs me my life!
:{{DIcon}} Still only you stationed here?
::'''Qiaoxi:''' Yeah, the higher-ups said there's no one else they could free up...
::'''Qiaoxi:''' But never mind. As long as this bridge stands, I'll be here guarding it.
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen someone who looks a lot like me?
::'''Qiaoxi:''' Does the person you want to find dress as... uniquely as you?
::'''Qiaoxi:''' In that case, I've never seen anyone like that. But if they do, that should definitely leave an impression.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' I remember everyone who crosses this bridge, never mind someone with such an unusual appearance.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' I'll keep a look out on your behalf. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Qiaoxi:''' Alright, off you go. Tread gently on the bridge, now. Don't step on anything.
