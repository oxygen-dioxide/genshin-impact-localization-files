|description     = A large serving of filling staple food.
|desc_suspicious = In your hurry, you did not mix the various ingredients well before eating, resulting in a ridiculously thick tomato flavor on one side of the rice, and an utter blandness on the other... Best you mix it a bit better next time.
|desc_basic      = In this dish that combines rice, noodles, and beans together, the secret of great taste lies in the sweet and sour flavor imparted by tomatoes. Owing to its common nature and low price, this dish is a great choice for sating one's hunger &mdash; which is one of the key reasons why this recipe has spread from Aaru Village to the rest of Sumeru.
|desc_delicious  = Each grain of rice is distinct and evenly coated in flavorful sauce as you spoon them into your mouth. No oily meats were used to make this dish, and yet its flavor is more alluring still. This dish stacks flavor like the endless dunes themselves, bringing a most unique satisfaction.
