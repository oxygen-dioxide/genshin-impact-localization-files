<section begin="Description" />The '''Inazuman Script''' (''unofficial name'') refers to the writing system of [[Inazuma]].

The script is based on the Teyvat alphabet<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv12239728 {{zh|【原神考据】稻妻文破解初步}}]</ref> and appears to be inspired by {{w|Japanese}} {{w|hiragana}}. It can be found written vertically from top-to-bottom, right-to-left, as with various traditional East Asian scripts, or it can be written horizontally. The glyphs used in the Inazuma script correspond to letters of the [[Latin]] alphabet instead of Japanese ''{{w|kana}}''. The texts written in this script are based on {{w|romaji|romanized}} Japanese.<section end="Description" />

==Deciphering==
While the Inazuman alphabet is used to represent romanized Japanese, in most cases, the Inazuman text does not correspond directly to each letter of the romaji. Typically, only the first letter of each syllable<!--or mora--> is rendered in Inazuman. Therefore, all syllables that start with the same consonant are typically rendered the same. For example, {{ja|か}}, {{ja|き}}, {{ja|く}}, {{ja|け}}, and {{ja|こ}} (''ka'', ''ki'', ''ku'', ''ke'', and ''ko'') would all be written as the Inazuman symbol for "K"<span class="hidden"> (よ<span style="position:relative; bottom:.3em; font-size:100%; margin-left:-0.9em;">⇁</span>)</span>. There is a large variation in which other letters are rendered. Voicing is sometimes ignored, such that {{ja|て}} (''te'') may be written with the symbol of "D" instead. Long vowels and {{ja|ん}} (''n'') are sometimes omitted. The letters in consonant digraphs such as ''sh'', ''ch'', and ''ts'' are sometimes both written. Further complicating matters, in longer texts which correspond to Japanese, some Inazuman symbols which would normally not be expected in romanized Japanese such as "L," "V," or "X" show up and may actually represent other sounds instead. This ambiguity and variation makes it difficult to decipher Inazuman texts, especially without context.
