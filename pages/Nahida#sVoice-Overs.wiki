I might look like a child, but don't be fooled: I understand this world much better than any grown-up. So... can we trade knowledge? I want to hear all about your travel stories.

|vo_05_02_tx         = The gods gave humans barely enough knowledge for them to fill their stomachs. Yet, they used it to craft tools, write books, and build cities, and now they've set their sights on the stars and the abyss...

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = [[Celestia|The heavens]] grew eyes to behold the true beauty of the world below, but humans already have eyes to begin with. So, what is it they see when they look at the world not with their eyes, but their vision? You're very smart. Can you figure out what the answer is?

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = Very often, only once we get hurt badly are we finally forced to face our own laziness, ignorance, recklessness, or arrogance. There's nothing to regret, though. We have no way of seeing all the possibilities that lie ahead in the future, so we have to rely on clumsy trial-and-error to gain knowledge. Just think of pain as the tuition you have to pay.

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things: A Flower Yet to Blossom
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things - A Flower Yet to Blossom.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = [[Sumeru]]'s desert looks more desolate than the rainforest, but it's also home to an ancient civilization, and supports its own stable ecosystem. One day, when it finally stops arguing with the rainforest, I'm sure that flowers will blossom there, the likes of which I've never seen before.

|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Cyno - Duty.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Not every General Mahamatra would take such a clear-cut and decisive stance when faced with a conflict between order and justice. He must know only too well that compromise is a path that leads to a dead end, so it's extremely fortunate for all of Sumeru that he's now been able to return to his rightful post.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Cyno

|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Tighnari.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = The [[Forest Watchers]] played an essential role in helping the rainforest to withstand the [[Withering]] and continue to flourish, and Tighnari is the best of them all. Still... I do hope he learns to be a little gentler with people. Otherwise, it's gonna be difficult for the Forest Rangers to attract new top talent.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Tighnari

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Collei]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Collei.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = When I heard her story for the first time, her tenacity shone through like a dazzling gemstone. She's been through so much... I hope that just as the rainforest supports all kinds of life, Sumeru will always provide a safe and nurturing environment for her, so that she can grow up healthy and strong.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Collei

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Alhaitham]]
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Alhaitham.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = He holds a body of knowledge more advanced than most could imagine, and his mind is constantly thinking, so maybe nothing in this world could ever fool him. But is the wise man truly wise to view the mediocre majority as defective? Because without them, there is no us.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Alhaitham

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Nilou]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Nilou.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = I once borrowed someone else's body to ask her if she'd mind allowing [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] to watch her dance... Actually, I had already watched her lots of times before in secret, but I wanted to attend her dance at the [[Sabzeruz Festival]] properly, in person, as a sign of respect. Anyway, it turned out that she gently declined the offer... I was a little sad about that.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Nilou

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Dori]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_quest      = Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Dori.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = The first thing she said when she saw me was "Nice palace. How much?" Of course, I couldn't possibly sell her the Sanctuary of Surasthana. But still, her question had me stumped. I thought about it long and hard, but I still can't figure out how much Mora it's worth...
|vo_08_07_mention    = Dori

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Kaveh]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kaveh.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = He has an almost-perfect grasp of what it truly means for Sumeru to be a Nation of Wisdom. Sadly, the truth as he understands it will never be accepted as the mainstream. Hmm? He's roommates with Alhaitham? Wow... the world really is full of surprises...
|vo_08_08_mention    = Kaveh,Alhaitham

|vo_08_09_title      = About [[Faruzan]]

|vo_08_09_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Faruzan.ogg
|vo_08_09_tx         = She is suffering from exposure to remnants of [[King Deshret]]'s power. It's as if the great tortoise of time accidentally threw her off its back and left her suspended in the past. If you're interested, you should be able to catch a glimpse of Sumeru from a bygone age through her.
|vo_08_09_mention    = Faruzan

|vo_08_10_title      = About [[The Seven]]: Introduction
|vo_08_10_friendship = 4
|vo_08_10_quest      = Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises
|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About The Seven - Introduction.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = I'm led to believe that long, long ago, the Seven [[Archons]] used to stay in regular contact with each other. I'm a bit of a special case though, so I don't have any memory of that time... Now that things have settled down in Sumeru, I think it's about time I made contact with them again. You're on familiar terms with some of them, right? Would you mind introducing me?

|vo_08_11_title      = About The Seven: Games
|vo_08_11_friendship = 4
|vo_08_11_quest      = Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises
|vo_08_11_file       = VO_{language}{character} About The Seven - Games.ogg
|vo_08_11_tx         = I hear that playing games is a good way to quickly bring people closer together. I'm sure it must work for gods, too. How about once everyone meets up, I suggest we play hopscotch together? ...Hmm, on second thought, maybe not. If I draw the squares, It would look like I made them really small on purpose just so I could win. That wouldn't be fair on the others.

|vo_08_12_title      = About [[Scaramouche|The Balladeer]]
|vo_08_12_friendship = 4
|vo_08_12_quest      = Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises
|vo_08_12_file       = VO_{language}{character} About The Balladeer.ogg
|vo_08_12_tx         = When he finally achieved the ambition he thought he'd been pursuing all along, was he content at last, or only emptier still? We only yearn for the skies because we cannot fly... Hmm, perhaps he should reflect on this once he has held the sheer emptiness of the skies in his grasp.
|vo_08_12_mention    = Scaramouche

|vo_08_13_title      = About [[Furina]]
|vo_08_13_friendship = 4
|vo_08_13_quest      = Masquerade of the Guilty
|vo_08_13_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Furina.ogg
|vo_08_13_tx         = People often say that wisdom isn't about what you know, but knowing what you can change. It is beyond question that the "[[prophecy]]" was carved into [[Irminsul]] long ago... and while it may look like nothing has changed, it also seems like everything has. I think we both know her to be smart enough to turn the fate of the world around.
|vo_08_13_mention    = Furina

|vo_08_14_title      = About [[Mavuika|Haborym]]
|vo_08_14_friendship = 4

|vo_08_14_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Haborym.ogg
|vo_08_14_tx         = The [[Abyss]] manifests its power in a manner that is most devastating to the place in question. In Sumeru, it was [[forbidden knowledge]]. In [[Natlan]], it was monstrous creatures. Our experience combatting the Abyss is inapplicable to Natlan for that very reason, but I still regret that I was unable to offer aid. Thankfully, the crisis has now been resolved, and Mavuika said many Natlanese are planning to visit Sumeru. I plan to welcome them with own arms!
|vo_08_14_mention    = Mavuika

|vo_09_01_tx         = My past is quite monotonous. I could tell you about it, but it wouldn't be long before you let out a great, big yawn, like a [[Pufferfish]] taking in a big gulp of water. But curiosity is worth its weight in gold, and I wouldn't want yours to go to waste... I know &mdash; let me tell you about all the dreams I've had.

Can you still enjoy the process of growing flowers when you already know the exact outcome in advance? Hehe, well, for me, I'm glad that at least after the flower has blossomed, it attracts different colored butterflies each time, and sometimes even bees.

Then, I shake it up, and time how long it takes to settle, and see if there's any difference from the last time. There's no reasoning behind it and nothing to gain out of it, but somehow it seems to relieve the exhaustion in my brain. I think that the fact that it's for nothing is what makes it fun for me.

|vo_09_04_tx         = In my dreams, there's often an empty space. No matter how the scenery changes around it, the emptiness always occupies the most important place. Strange, isn't it? I think there used to be something there, but for all the power I have over dreams, I still can't find the answer as to what it was.
