==Overview==
===Specters===
Specters have a rage bar that fills based on the amount of damage inflicted from a single hit, this amount varying based on the Specter's level. As it fills, the specter becomes larger and angrier. When completely filled, they begin using new attacks and have their Final Burst attack enhanced.

===Riftwolves===
Riftwolves have a rage bar that fills when they are struck with an elemental attack of their affinity &mdash; e.g., hitting a [[Rockfond Rifthound]] with {{Geo}} causes it to accumulate rage. If the bar is completely filled, the meter completely disappears and the Riftwolf enters its Devourer state. This can be easily seen with their elementally colored parts glowing brighter. In this state, the Riftwolf's attacks are enhanced but their elemental resistance of their affinity significantly drops.

===Pyro Hypostasis===
The Pyro Hypostasis has a rage bar that appears whenever it is extinguished. At periodic intervals during the fight, it will conjure three Flame Seeds to reaccumulate rage. Destroying these seeds lowers the amount of rage it can accumulate. If the rage bar fills, the Pyro Hypostasis returns into its ignited state.

===Thunder Manifestation===
The Thunder Manifestation has a rage bar present at all times during the fight. It possesses two simple attacks in its non-enraged state &mdash; thunder pylons and a burst attack. If the player steps within range of an active pylon, the manifestation slowly gains rage stacks, but these will dissipate if the player steps out of their radius. Getting hit by the burst attack will immediately fill the bar to full. The bar automatically fills to full if it reaches 75% of its health and has not been enraged yet.

The enrage state lasts permanently and a lock-on icon will appear on the player's characters as an indicator it is fully enraged. In this state, the Thunder Manifestation uses devastating attacks that deal rapid or massive damage (or a combination of both) if not dodged.

===Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto===
The boss fight with [[the Shogun]] involves a form of Fury named "Ominous Destiny." She gains Ominous Destiny over time and will gain more upon landing hits on player characters. If the meter becomes completely full, the Shogun will immediately enter her "Baleful Shadowlord" state, using a different set of attacks and gains an {{Electro}} shield that significantly reduces incoming damage.

===Jadeplume Terrorshroom===
The Jadeplume Terrorshrom has a rage bar present at all times during the fight. Hitting the Terrorshroom with an {{Electro}} attack will cause it to fill up by 2%, inflicting [[Quicken]], [[Spread]], or [[Aggravate]] will cause it to fill by 15%. When the bar fills, the Terrorshroom will perform one of three empowered attacks before collapsing with reduced resistances. Hitting the Terrorshroom with a {{Pyro}} attack will reduce the bar by 34%, and scorching it completely will cause it to attempt to summon several scorched [[Floating Dendro Fungus]] instead.

===All-Devouring Narwhal===
The boss fight against the All-Devouring Narwhal has a rage bar present, named "Hostility". It gains rage throughout the fight, whenever it takes damage and when the Eye of the Maelstrom is destroyed. When the rage bar is completely full, the Narwhal will devour the player, sending them into its belly to initiate the other half of the fight. Once the Narwhal's health falls below 20%, the rage bar is removed.

===Secret Source Automatons===
Both the [[Secret Source Automaton: Hunter-Seeker]] and [[Secret Source Automaton: Configuration Device]] make use of a rage bar that fills when they are in combat against an active party member with [[Nightsoul's Blessing]].

For the normal automatons, they will fill their bar at a rate of 15 units while a Nightsoul's Blessing state is active. Upon reaching 100 units, the automaton will enter an adaptive countermeasure mode, using a more powerful attack at the cost of lowering its RES by 40%.

For the boss, they will fill their bar at a rate of 15 units while a Nightsoul's Blessing state is active. Upon reaching 200 units, the automaton will enter an adaptive countermeasure mode, sweeping the area with minor attacks before charging up its cannon. Unlike the normal automatons, its RES is not lowered until the cannon attack is interrupted.

===Eroding Avatar of Lava===
The [[Eroding Avatar of Lava]] has a rage bar present. Whenever it is hit with {{Pyro}}, the bar is slowly filled. After reaching 20%, 40% and 60% Fury, it will take {{Color|True Physical DMG}} equal to 25%, 20% and 15% of its Max HP respectively. If this bar fills completely, the avatar will automatically be defeated.

The [[Local Legend]] variant has a different rage bar. Like its base variant, the bar fills when hit with {{Pyro}}. While the fury bar is not filled, it will gain increased RES, which is lifted once the fury bar is filled.

===Cocijo===
[[Cocijo]] has a fury bar that accumulates by 3% for every instance of DMG taken. Upon reaching a full bar, it will form a Thunderthorn Shield, becoming immune to DMG until the shield is removed. While shielded, its attacks are further enhanced.

===Lava Dragon Statue===
The [[Lava Dragon Statue]] has a rage bar present.

The statue initially spawns in its Geohuman state with a rage bar that fills when hit with {{Pyro}}. Once the first bar is filled, it will transform into the Molten Dragon state, decreasing its RES to all non-Pyro attacks. This second bar also fills when hit with {{Pyro}}; however, applying {{Cryo}} or {{Hydro}} will cause it to deplete. If the bar completely empties in this state, it will revert back to the Geohuman form. If the bar is instead filled, it will enter the Overburn state, stunning it and significantly decreasing its RES to all attacks.

==Trivia==
* Fury was also featured in the event [[Kaboomball Kombat]].
* The icon for Fury is the same as the icon for [[Stamina]].
