==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cipac:''' Hello there! Looking for something to eat? You can grab a bite to have while you stroll through the market, or take it with you to watch a match &mdash; it's completely up to you!
:{{DIcon|Restaurant}} I am indeed somewhat hungry.
::'''Cipac:''' Hehe, here's the menu.
:{{DIcon}} How's business been?
::'''Cipac:''' Not bad, but not the best.
::'''Cipac:''' After all, there's no matches on right this moment. Of course, we're busiest during the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], when everyone rushes over to the Stadium with a snack or drink in hand.
::'''Cipac:''' And if you get hungry while you're watching a match, go find that young man Agemo.
::'''Cipac:''' He's from the [[Scions of the Canopy]], about... This tall. Agh, speaking of which, where's he gotten off to now?
::'''Cipac:''' Anyway, he's quick on his feet, that one. Whatever you want, he'll bring you it exactly how it's meant to taste, be it piping hot or ice cold!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Cipac:''' Come again next time!
