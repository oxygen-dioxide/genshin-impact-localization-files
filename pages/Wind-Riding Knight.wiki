:{{A|vo mdaq015 1 cs ambor 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hey, you! Stop right there!
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 01.ogg}} '''???:''' May the Anemo God protect you, stranger!
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I am Amber, Outrider for the Knights of Favonius.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You don't look like citizens of Mondstadt. Explain yourselves!
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're not looking for trouble.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' That's what all the troublemakers say.
:{{DIcon}} Hello, I'm (Traveler).
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' ...Doesn't sound like a local name to me.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' And this... mascot, what's the deal with it?
:{{DIcon}} We're friends.
::{{A|vo mdaq016 2 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've only been traveling partners for two months, but...
::{{A|vo mdaq016 2 paimon 02a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've already become the very best of friends!
:{{DIcon}} Emergency food.
::{{A|vo mdaq016 2 paimon 02b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! That's even worse than being a mascot!
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' So to sum it up, you're traveling partners, right?
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Well look, there's been a large dragon sighted around Mondstadt recently. Best you get inside the city as soon as possible.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 09.ogg}} '''Amber:''' It's not far from here, I'll escort you there.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Aren't you out here for some other reason?
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 10.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I am. But not to worry, I can keep you both safe while doing that too.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 11.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Besides... I'm still not sure if I can trust you two just yet!
:{{DIcon}} Why so suspicious?
:{{DIcon}} That's a rather rude way to speak to guests.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 12.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Oh, ahh... I'm sorry. Probably not something I should say as a knight.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 13.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I give you my apologies, uh... strange yet... respectable travelers.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounded so fake!
:{{A|vo mdaq016 2 ambor 14.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Do you have something against the type of language usage prescribed by the [[Knights of Favonius Handbook - 5th Edition|Knights of Favonius Handbook]]!?

;(As the player goes to the designated location)
:{{A|vo mdaq016 4 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' So, suspicious travelers, what are you doing in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo mdaq016 4 paimon 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo mdaq016 4 paimon 01b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler) got separated from {{MC|his sister|her brother|mc=1}} during a really, really long journey.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 4 paimon 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo mdaq016 4 paimon 02b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon is {{MC|his|her|mc=1}} travel buddy, helping {{MC|him|her|mc=1}} to find {{MC|his sister|her brother|mc=1}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 4 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Oh, looking for your family... Huh.
:{{A|vo mdaq016 4 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo mdaq016 4 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Okay! Let me finish my other stuff first, and then I can help you put up posters around the city...
:{{A|vo mdaq016 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What exactly is it you need to finish doing first?
:{{A|vo mdaq016 4 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' It's simple. You'll understand in a bit.
