<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->

:'''Heihachi:''' Who're you, and what're you looking at, huh?
:{{DIcon}} ...
::'''Heihachi:''' What are you staring at me for?
::'''Heihachi:''' This tea's absolutely disgusting, by the way! Give me a crow's spittle any day!
::'''Heihachi:''' Pfah. Never mind the tea, even the scenery is bad, what with all these outlanders skulking about in an Inazuman shop.
::'''Heihachi:''' And they say that this is some high-end pad that only serves an upper class clientele... Hmph. This place might as well be a straw hut as far as I'm concerned.
::'''Heihachi:''' If it weren't for an official assignment, I wouldn't have wanted to be here.
::{{DIcon}} Official assignment, you say?
::'''Heihachi:''' Oh, if isn't all thanks to you outlanders. You sit and enjoy the fruits of others' hard work, and you always cause trouble.
::'''Heihachi:''' Take that guy from Snezhnaya for example. He's been good for nothing all this time. He just wanders around asking about things, and he's been around forever.
::'''Heihachi:''' If it weren't for the fact that he's been staying in that lame old tea house, I would have...
::'''Heihachi:''' Bah, why am I telling you this? Who are you anyway?
::'''Heihachi:''' You'd better watch it! Don't let me catch you doing anything bad. I won't be so nice if you get in my way.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Heihachi:''' Aye, off you get. Ugh, this crappy place with its crap tea and lack of cleanliness...
