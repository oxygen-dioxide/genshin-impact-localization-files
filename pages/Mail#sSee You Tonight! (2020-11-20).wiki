|text    = I've put a few more hours in these last two days to finish all the work I might have in the near future.

Since it's my birthday, I'll show you around [[Liyue Harbor]].

The night markets here are full of places to go. Between the shops that sell artisan handicrafts and those who hawk little gadgets and trinkets, even a light stroll is well worth your time.

I'll change into more ordinary clothes, and disguise myself a little, so I don't get recognized by the citizenry.

That way, we can spend some leisure time shopping together &mdash; just the two of us.
