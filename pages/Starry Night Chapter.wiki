;(If ''Risen Moon Chapter'' has not been completed)
{{Quest Description|A group of Eremites are wandering through the forest, looking like they are up to no good. Approach them and inquire about their intentions.}}
;(If ''Risen Moon Chapter'' was completed first)
{{Quest Description|Look for Aranakin upon [[Aragaru]]'s request.}}

;(Approach the Eremites)
:'''Paimon:''' What are these guys doing here?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders what scheme they're up to...

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Lunja, optional)
:'''???:''' (Ugh... It's so humid here. Feels awful.)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on [[Minum]], optional)
:'''???:''' (Ugh, I've got water in my shoes...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on [[Ziri]], optional)
:'''???:''' (*sigh* If the boss hadn't lost all our Mora in [[Genius Invokation TCG|card games]]...)

;(Talk to the Eremites)
:'''???:''' Ha, friends! How nice to see someone alive in this dump!
:'''Lunja:''' Hi, call me Lunja, of [[Farrokhzadan|The Farrokhzadan]], even though technically, I'm a Farrokhdokht, haha! These are my boys...
:'''Minum:''' ...Minum.
:'''Ziri:''' Ziri.
:'''Lunja:''' Very good, very upbeat! As you can see, me and the boys welcome you here. Please help yourself to a hot meal!
:'''Lunja:''' Ahem, right, Minum, Ziri?
:'''Minum:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Ms. Lunja, they don't look very enthusiastic...
:'''Lunja:''' Ahem, show some enthusiasm, boys!
:'''Minum:''' *sigh*...
:'''Ziri:''' Welcome, strangers.
:'''Lunja:''' My apologies! They're from the desert and haven't gotten used to the rainforest.
:'''Lunja:''' It's humid and stuffy. You can wring water out of your shirt, pants, and bandana. It's such a mess after every fight...
:'''Lunja:''' You probably know we have three thousand terms to classify sand, and tens of thousands of ways to deal with it.
:'''Lunja:''' But moisture and plants? I'm out. They make me uncomfortable the whole time, and I feel like I'll never be able to deal with them.
:'''Lunja:''' That's enough of my nagging. Job comes first... And too much complaining hurts morale! After all, life is life, but business is still business, right?
:'''Paimon:''' (Hey, {{Traveler}}, Paimon thinks we just ran into a bunch of weirdos.)
:{{DIcon}} (They are weird.)
:{{DIcon}} (We should leave as soon as we can.)
:'''Lunja:''' Ahem, excuse me, but I didn't get your names. Where did you come from and what are you doing here?
:{{DIcon}} Just call me {{Traveler}}.
;(If ''Risen Moon Chapter'' has not been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's name is Paimon! We're here to...
;(If ''Risen Moon Chapter'' was completed first)
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's name is Paimon! Ara...
::'''Lunja:''' Ara...?
:{{DIcon}} We're adventurers just passing by.
::'''Lunja:''' Is that so? What could be in this rainforest that is worth risking your lives for?
::{{DIcon}} That is classified information.
::{{DIcon}} It depends on what we'll find.
::'''Lunja:''' Haha! You adventurers are such interesting people. May the gale and sand never blind you and may you find what you seek!
:{{DIcon}} Someone sent us here.
::'''Lunja:''' Someone sent you? It must be someone of high standing, or at least someone very rich, right?
::{{DIcon}} Well... I wouldn't exactly say that.
::{{DIcon}} It's not what you think.
::'''Lunja:''' Is that so...
::'''Lunja:''' So, if, and I mean if, you're rival bounty hunters, what should I do with you?
::'''Paimon:''' Eh?
::'''Lunja:''' Freaked you out, didn't I? Minum, Ziri, did you see that? They freaked out!
::'''Minum:''' ...Yeah.
::'''Ziri:''' They freaked out, obviously.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, no, not at all! Grow up, people!
::'''Lunja:''' Sorry, don't mind that, it was just a joke!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, it wasn't funny at all!
::'''Lunja:''' Relax. To us Eremites, daring to harm our guests is to court the wrath of the merciless desert.
:'''Minum:''' We don't mean to interrupt, boss, but...
:'''Ziri:''' It's time we get going.
:'''Lunja:''' ...
:'''Lunja:''' All right. We've got to run, my friends. Sorry we can't extend our hospitality.
:'''Lunja:''' Once we part, you're on your own. Without the desert folk watching your back, you'd better keep an eye out for wild beasts...
:'''Lunja:''' The savage jungle is just like desert. In the desert, when you leave your tribe, you're on your own. You will be an easy prey for the hungry beasts.
:{{DIcon}} Is that a threat?
:'''Lunja:''' A threat? Why would I threaten my friends? It's just a kind reminder! Who do you think I am?
:'''Lunja:''' How irritating... Come, Minum and Ziri, let's go!
:'''Minum:''' Wait...
:'''Ziri:''' The pot...!
:'''Lunja:''' Just leave it there for our new friends! Let's go!
;(A scene transition occurs)
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|After Lunja and her group left, a little Aranara pops his head out, looking desperate for help. see what he needs help with.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Paimon:''' These guys are weird, so eager to get chummy...
:{{DIcon}} We'd better be careful.
:'''???:''' Yes, yes, you should be careful.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, since you both say so...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:'''???:''' Huh!?
:'''???:''' Hey! You startled me!!
:'''Paimon:''' That's Paimon's line!
:'''Paimon:''' Hm... Speaking of which, little one, who are you?
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin isn't a "little one," Aranakin is Aranakin!
:'''Aranakin:''' You can't listen to those sand grains. They're liars with bad minds who are here for the Aranara!
:{{DIcon}} Bad minds...?
::'''Aranakin:''' Bad minds, bad bad minds!
:{{DIcon}} What are the "sand grains" you are talking about?
::'''Aranakin:''' Sand is Valuka, and those sand grains are a group of bad Nara Valuka. I don't like sand, it's coarse, rough, and irritating. And it gets everywhere...
:'''Paimon:''' What...? Paimon didn't get that at all...
:'''Aranakin:''' White Floaty is silly, so White Floaty didn't get it.
:'''Paimon:''' Wha&mdash; Hey!
:{{DIcon}} He's talking about those people from just now.
:{{DIcon}} They must have some sort of a scheme.
:'''Aranakin:''' Nara {{Traveler}} smart, that's what Aranakin means.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? You know our names?
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin smart. When you talked to them, I listened. I heard that Nara's name is "{{Traveler}}" and that your name is "Paimon."
:'''Aranakin:''' But Floaty Paimon is silly and doesn't understand Aranakin.
;(If ''Risen Moon Chapter'' has not been completed)
::{{DIcon}} Floaty Paimon is like that, it's true.
:::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Paimon's not silly!
::{{DIcon}} Is there something we can do for you?
:::'''Aranakin:''' Yes, something very important! So very important! [[Mawtiyima]] is in great danger, the grass and trees in the forest... Everyone is worried! She asked us to find you. We waited for so long.
::'''Aranakin:''' First, we need to find Zohrah Mushroom. Zohrah Mushroom, is little shiny spots, just like my songs!
::'''Aranakin:''' But to find Zohrah Mushroom, you need "Kusava."
::'''Aranakin:''' Um, that's fine. You guys are great. Aranakin can entrust Kusava to you.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... it comes again, things Paimon can't understand. Kusawan? What is that?
::'''Aranakin:''' Fatty fruit, bitter fruit. Temporary home of Aranara memories. Kusava makes Aranara strong.
;(If ''Risen Moon Chapter'' was completed first)
::{{DIcon}} Floaty Paimon is like that, it's true.
:::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Paimon's not silly!
::{{DIcon}} Aragaru sent us here.
:::'''Aranakin:''' I know. All the grass and trees, one by one, were passing the message, and it got to me. So I knew I would see you here!
:'''Aranakin:''' Mawtiyima is feeling sick, [[Marana]] is getting bigger. We must go quickly. Quickly!
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Wait a second, we don't even know where we're going!
:'''Aranakin:''' Zohrah Mushroom! We need Zohrah Mushroom, to prepare [[Arahaoma]]. We need Arahaoma, to help Mawtiyima be lively again!
:'''Aranakin:''' I know where Zohrah Mushroom is, I take you there!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright... Hey, wait for us!
;(Obtain "Kusava" if not already acquired)

{{Quest Description|update|A little one named Aranakin entrusts you with the "Kusava," which is said to have the power to repair broken stones. Use it to get rid of obstacles and solve puzzles along your way.}}

:'''Aranakin:''' This is it... Quick, let's put it together!

{{Quest Description|update|Use the Kusava to repair the ancient stones, and let the water drain away... Well, at least Aranakin says so.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area in the cave)
:'''Aranakin:''' Over here, Nara {{Traveler}}, Floaty Paimon!
:'''Paimon:''' There's water everywhere. That "Zohrah Mushroom" you mentioned... Is it really here?
:'''Aranakin:''' Here, underwater. Rocks and vines protect and cover him, so he's safe in water.
:'''Aranakin:''' Rocks blessed by [[Nara Varuna]] broke apart by themselves after many many moonsets.
:'''Aranakin:''' Broken rocks sealed off the path to Zohrah Mushroom and protected him.
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin can repair the rocks and make the water leave, so we can find Zohrah Mushroom.
:'''Aranakin:''' Use the Kusava to summon Aranakin's power. Aranakin... trusts you will treat the Kusava well?
:'''Paimon:''' Of course. We'll cherish anything you entrust us with!
:'''Aranakin:''' *humming* Kusava~ Kusava~♪
:'''Paimon:''' Cool~seek~wan~♪
:{{DIcon}} Ko~se~han~♪
::'''Aranakin:''' Wow, that was terrible.
:{{DIcon}} Why the singing all of a sudden?
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin sings happy songs because there's hope for Mawtiyima, because Nara is willing to help!

;(After activating the broken elemental monument)
:'''Aranakin:''' The water level has lowered... Look, there's another broken stone over there! Use the Kusava to piece it together!

;(Approaching the next broken elemental monument)
:'''Aranakin:''' There's the last one. Let's use the Kusava on it!

{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|According to Aranakin, the plants and Shroom-Kin in the cave know where the Zohrah Mushroom is.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]])
:'''Paimon:''' Is this the Zohrah Mushroom? It looks so... mundane.
:'''Aranakin:''' Mm, this is...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Aranakin:''' It is just an ordinary mushroom, very cunning. Very clever.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? So we wasted all that effort?
:{{DIcon}} But where is the Zohrah Mushroom?
:{{DIcon}} Is the Zohrah Mushroom not here?
:'''Aranakin:''' Zohrah Mushroom is no ordinary mushroom, thus more cunning and clever. He's probably escaped by now.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Mushrooms can run away too?
:'''Aranakin:''' Of course! They don't have roots but can absorb nutrients in rocks. They don't have legs but can run, for they are mushrooms, not plants! But don't fret, Nara {{Traveler}}, let me ask this fellow.
:{{Black Screen|Aranakin and the mushroom speak in whispers.}}
:'''Aranakin:''' It said, Zohrah Mushroom went to a cave that has Marana, which has dissolved in the water. It's very dangerous.
:'''Paimon:''' But why would the Zohrah Mushroom go there?
:'''Aranakin:''' Because Marana moves too fast and must be stopped. Zohrah Mushroom can stop Marana, but won't hold up for long.
:'''Paimon:''' Mmm... Then we better get going and save the mushroom!
:'''Aranakin:''' Yes, we must hurry!

{{Quest Description|update|You arrived at the cave containing the Zohrah Mushroom. However, the entrance to the cave seems to be blocked by some familiar &mdash; but unpleasant &mdash; people...}}

;(Approach the Eremites)
:'''Minum:''' Stop.
:'''Ziri:''' You can't enter.
:'''Paimon:''' Why are you people here again? Come on! What are you doing here?
:{{DIcon}} Out on a date, perchance?
:{{DIcon}} Guarding something important, perhaps?
:'''Minum:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, you can't even come up with an answer, that's so suspicious!
:'''Minum:''' You can't enter.
:'''Ziri:''' You can't enter, and that's that.
:{{DIcon}} Are you two serious?
:{{DIcon}} You two think you can stop me?
:'''Minum:''' ...
:'''Lunja:''' ...It's three. Three at least.
:'''Lunja:''' Pardon my boys, they're not good with words. I've already made it clear that I'd never threaten friends. It was just a warning, that's all.
:'''Lunja:''' Whatever you want is not in this cave, unless it's death. Everything dies in there, no matter what it is.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't try to scare us. We've experienced all kinds of danger!
:'''Lunja:''' Why would I try to scare you when I'm elated to see you again? I'm just worried about your safety.
:'''Lunja:''' We discovered a [[Withering Zone]] inside. That's why we've drawn a circle at the entrance to warn commoners from wandering in.
:'''Paimon:''' Where's the circle then?
:'''Lunja:''' ...
:'''Lunja:''' Where's the circle?
:'''Minum:''' ...
:'''Lunja:''' Tell me now, where's the circle!
:'''Minum:''' I, uh, he, uh...
:'''Ziri:''' You're the boss, so there's one if you say so.
:'''Lunja:''' Ahem. Regardless, my friends, the cave is treacherous and unpredictable. I suggest you leave right now.
:{{DIcon}} How come it's you again?
::'''Lunja:''' "Again"? Well, I guess fate works in mysterious ways. It's got plans for us.
:{{DIcon}} I'm no commoner.
:'''Lunja:''' That's what we all thought when we picked up our first sword! Until we saw blood for the first time.
:'''Lunja:''' Alright, alright... Don't listen to me, then. Like I said, I warned you out of the goodness of my heart. Go in if you insist... It's not like you're hiring us to be your bodyguards, right?
:'''Lunja:''' Come on, boys. We're out of here.
:'''Minum:''' ...
:'''Lunja:''' Ahem, let's go!

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Lunja, optional)
:'''Lunja:''' (Who threw a frog into the pot? ...Uh, does it taste good?)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Minum, optional)
:'''Minum:''' (There is a... frog in the pot. Should I remind the boss of it...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Ziri, optional)
:'''Ziri:''' (Little do they know that... I was to blame for the frog in the pot...)

;(Talk to Lunja)
:'''Lunja:''' You're our guests. Make yourselves at home.

;(Talk to Minum)
:'''Minum:''' ...

;(Talk to Ziri)
:'''Ziri:''' Be careful in the cave.

;(Talk to Lunja again after talking to each of the Farrokhzadan)
:'''Lunja:''' Come, my friends, sit down and have some tea! So, did whatever it was in the cave scare you away?
:'''Lunja:''' Haha, it's fine, really! You're still alive, aren't you? Nothing matters more than that. Some things you just have to let go.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not done yet.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not giving up yet.
:'''Lunja:''' Is that so? That's great. Minum, Ziri, you guys heard that? Let's make a toast to this great adventurer!
:'''Minum:''' To courage...
:'''Ziri:''' To health.
:'''Lunja:''' To the bleak paths ahead and the treacherous exits to come! Cheers!

{{Quest Description|update|After having a not-so-pleasant talk with Lunja and her gang, you finally resume your search for the Zohrah Mushroom. The target you're after should be in the cave.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the cave)
:'''Aranakin:''' I'm here! Nara {{Traveler}}, and White Floaty!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, where have you been?
:'''Aranakin:''' Some bad "sand grains" were here. They were up to no good, so I didn't want to come out.
:'''Paimon:''' Are you referring to those Eremite mercenaries? Are you afraid of them?
:'''Aranakin:''' White Floaty wrong! I'm not afraid! They're weak, I'm strong!
:{{DIcon}} Strong to the point of hiding?
::'''Aranakin:''' No, no! Hmph! Nara {{Traveler}} only says irritating things!
:{{DIcon}} We have to be careful from now on.
::'''Aranakin:''' Nara {{Traveler}} is right. Be careful of those bad "sand grains" and their wicked thoughts.
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, the water here... It's showing some strange colors. Do you think it's because of...
:{{DIcon}} The Withering.
:{{DIcon}} Marana.
:'''Aranakin:''' Correct, it is Marana. It permeates the water and dances like mist... So you can't drink the water, and it makes the plants sick.
:'''Aranakin:''' Thanks to Zohrah Mushroom, Marana has withdrawn a little. But Marana is still too much around. Zohrah Mushroom is not feeling well. He's in danger.
:'''Paimon:''' But the place is all affected by The Withering. How are we supposed to get close?
:'''Aranakin:''' Hmm... Look at that odd old rock over there! Repair it and the crack in the pond should open big enough... to drain the water away.
:'''Paimon:''' But... even if we can drain the water, what are we going to do with The Withering here?
:'''Aranakin:''' Well... We'll worry about that later! We also have to break the seal protecting Zohrah Mushroom to let him join us!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, got it. Let's get to work then!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Use the Kusava to repair the ancient broken stone to drain the water... Looks like you'll have to repeat the process again.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aranakin:''' The Kusava can temporarily wake up plants tainted by Marana... And also let them sprout new vines, but very painful, very uncomfortable...
:'''Aranakin:''' It's okay, though, I can take it...!

;(After activating the elemental monument)
:'''Aranakin:''' The water level has been lowered! There's the Zohrah Mushroom!

;(Approach the mushroom)
:'''Aranakin:''' Hmm... It's sealed. We need to look around for the stones that can lift the seal. Use the Kusava!

:'''Lunja:''' Minum, Ziri, I got it! Find a messenger to inform the client! And we're leaving now!
:'''Lunja:''' Those were tough opponents. The Withering couldn't stop them, Anqa and Isan got hurt too. So before they catch up with us...
:'''Minum:''' Boss...
:'''Lunja:''' Didn't you hear what I said? What are you waiting for?
:'''Ziri:''' {{MC|m=He|f=She}} is here already.
:'''Lunja:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} I'm all ears. Please continue.
:{{DIcon}} Is this how you treat your "friends"?
:'''Lunja:''' *sigh* I just can't get rid of you, can I...
:'''Lunja:''' Sorry, my "friends," we just wanted the Zohrah Mushroom for our client. Just business, nothing personal.
:'''Paimon:''' Friends? We're not friends! How can you still call us that?
:'''Lunja:''' What do you mean, little one? I already apologized. Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
:'''Paimon:''' Aaahh!! You...!
:'''Lunja:''' Seriously, you've proven you're extraordinary by giving Anqa and Isan a good thrashing.
:'''Lunja:''' I admire warriors like you. It's my honor to be your friend. But... business is business. I'm sure you understand, right? I hate to break our friendship.
:'''Lunja:''' It would be such a shame to let some boring business get in between us friends!
:{{DIcon}} Just get to the point.
:{{DIcon}} Hand over the Zohrah Mushroom.
:'''Lunja:''' Take it easy, my friend. You're the ones who are cornered in this cave. You wanna risk your life for it? Not a problem.
:'''Lunja:''' But I'd rather not see more of my people get hurt over a lousy mushroom. The pay's just not worth it. So, let's make a deal...
:'''Paimon:''' Who would trust a scammer like you?
:'''Lunja:''' Well, that depends on how much you're willing to pay.
:{{DIcon}} Let's hear your offer first.
::'''Paimon:''' Are you serious about doing business with her?
::'''Lunja:''' I'll make it short, then. A rich old man in the Akademiya hired us, the Eremites, to find the Zohrah Mushroom in the forest.
::'''Lunja:''' The pay's very good, but the deadline's very tight. And as you can see, a young and charming woman like me really needed Mora.
::'''Paimon:''' ...
::'''Lunja:''' You know the rest. Sorry for using you to get this Zo... and almost killing... Uh, almost stopping you from pursuing me.
::'''Lunja:''' But since you're alive and kicking, we'll still be friends and let bygones be bygones, right?
::'''Paimon:''' No! That's attempted murder. Let bygones be bygones!? Someone could have gotten killed!
::'''Lunja:''' Well, that's exactly what I'm worried about. They're all my family. I don't want to endanger anyone, or it's a bad deal.
::'''Lunja:''' Therefore, it seems that a peaceful resolution is the way to go. But what do you want the mushroom for, anyway?
::{{DIcon}} We need it to save the forest.
:::'''Lunja:''' Hmph... That old man did mention the Zohrah Mushroom is the key to eradicating The Withering, and that was why he wanted us to get it at all cost.
:::'''Lunja:''' But it ain't anything valuable, and The Withering in these blasted woods have nothing to do with us desert dwellers.
:::'''Lunja:''' The intrinsic value of the mushroom, plus labor, medical expenses for Anqa and Isan, fines for breach of contract, and... a little extra to compensate a friend.
:::'''Lunja:''' That comes out to 450,000 Mora and not a penny less. How's that? You're getting off cheap.
:::'''Paimon:''' What!? That's robbery!
:::'''Lunja:''' 500,000 Mora for calling me a robber and hurting my feelings! We're traders, so watch your words.
:::{{DIcon}} I accept your offer.
::::'''Paimon:''' What!?
::::'''Lunja:''' Haha, all right! 550,000 Mora it is!
::::'''Paimon:''' What the heck!?
::::'''Lunja:''' Because that's how I like it!
::::{{DIcon}} But I don't have that much Mora on me right now.
::::'''Lunja:''' Sorry, no IOU! Perhaps you can give me that squawking flying pet of yours as collateral?
::::'''Paimon:''' Eh!? Don't do that!
::::{{DIcon}} That's not what I meant...
::::{{DIcon}} Please hear me out...
::::'''Lunja:''' You're kinda cute when you bargain. I'm listening.
::::{{DIcon}} Give me the mushroom and I promise you'll get your money later.
::::'''Lunja:''' I didn't think a promise could be worth that much. But what are you going to do if I don't believe you?
::::{{DIcon}} Minum's kneecaps look brittle to me.
::::{{DIcon}} It will be interesting to see how I smash Ziri's nose in.
::::{{DIcon}} How much more do you think you can afford Anqa and Isan's medical bills?
::::'''Lunja:''' ...
::::'''Lunja:''' Don't be full of yourself. They're The Farrokhzadan and also my boys.
::::{{DIcon}} I've already taken down two of you. What's a few more?
::::{{DIcon}} Now just think about how much Mora you will lose if you tick me off.
::::'''Lunja:''' Hmph... Interesting offer you have there. I'll believe you... this time. Let's go, boys.
::::{{DIcon}} Not so fast.
::::'''Lunja:''' Why? You changed your mind?
::::{{DIcon}} I'm pondering how you're going to compensate us.
::::'''Lunja:''' Interesting. And why would we do that?
::::'''Paimon:''' Because you laid the trap and tricked us! Plus... ahem, Ziri's nose, Minum's kneecaps, Anqa and Isan's injuries...
::::'''Lunja:''' Tsk, name your price.
::::{{DIcon}} Mora is the best compensation.
:::::'''Paimon:''' That's right, Mora!
::::{{DIcon}} It's more sincere when it's something precious.
:::::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Got to be valuable, at least!
:::::'''Lunja:''' I see. If this would prevent my boys from getting hurt...
::::'''Paimon:''' Well, you should've seen it coming!
::::'''Lunja:''' ...That's not a good way to do business. Agha Farrokh will never forget your offense, and you will get it when the table is turned.
::::'''Lunja:''' Let's go, boys, and remember their faces!
::::'''Lunja:''' Final advice: Keep one eye open when you sleep at night. Don't forget, my "friends," you haven't paid for what you bought yet.
:::;(Lunja and the Eremites leave without engaging in combat)
:::{{DIcon}} Giving you guys a good thrashing seems to be the better deal here.
::::'''Lunja:''' Ha! Is that the so-called buyer's pride? I like it!
::::'''Lunja:''' Take everything valuable from them!
:::;(Engage in combat)
::{{DIcon}} (Ready for combat) Your losses aren't my problem.
:::'''Lunja:''' ...Don't want to do business, eh?
:::'''Lunja:''' *sigh* Get them, boys!
::;(Engage in combat)
:{{DIcon}} (Ready for combat) I can offer you a lesson.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, you're extorting the wrong people!
::'''Lunja:''' I see. I respect your proposal.
::'''Lunja:''' Hmph... Your tenacity is so infuriating! We're deep in the red for this one! All right, boys, get ready to fight!

;(After defeating the Eremites, if the player engaged in combat)
::'''Paimon:''' Well, you picked on the wrong person! The Zohrah Mushroom is ours now!
::'''Aranakin:''' Impressive! Nara {{Traveler}} made those bad "sand grains" run off in a couple of moves! Pow! Smash!
::'''Paimon:''' That's super fighter Nara {{Traveler}} for you!

;(If the player negotiated with Lunja)
::'''Paimon:''' They're gone... They better not try to scam us again next time. Anyway, we got the Zohrah Mushroom!
::'''Aranakin:''' The bad "sand grains" are terrifying, but Nara {{Traveler}} is even more so sometimes... Scaring people away with strange words.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, yeah, {{Traveler}} is like that sometimes.
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin's right to trust you. Nara {{Traveler}} is no sand grain but a mighty seed! Aranakin must sing about it and let everyone in the woods know!
:'''Aranakin:''' Yay~ Kusava~ Kusava~♪
:'''Paimon:''' Cool~seek~wan~♪
:{{DIcon}} Ko~se~han~♪
:'''Aranakin:''' Ku! Sa! Va! Happy!
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin is going to the Mawtiyima Forest and meet up with friends. You must come see us and join the ritual coming up!
;(If ''Risen Moon Chapter'' has not been completed)
::'''Aranakin:''' Oh yeah, friend Aragaru is waiting for you too. I'll tell the plants along the way to inform him that you're coming.
::'''Aranakin:''' He'll be waiting for you in the cave where the moon falls. He'll guide you to the dead Nara's old home. The walking Shroom-Kin now live there. Be careful.
;(If ''Risen Moon Chapter'' was completed first)
::'''Aranakin:''' Speaking of the Mawtiyima Forest, Aranaga is waiting for you there. He presides over the Arahaoma ritual. Go see him!
:{{DIcon}} I'll bear that in mind.
:'''Aranakin:''' Oh, and... Uh, don't go yet...
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin loves to sing and share songs with friends. But Aranakin doesn't know if Nara could hear Aranara's songs.
:'''Paimon:''' Yes, we can! Paimon loves to sing too!
:'''Aranakin:''' Then Aranakin will give you this song. Please take the songleaf. Follow its veins with Nara's voice and the song will come out.
:'''Paimon:''' So you mean that, uh, we can follow the score and learn your song?
:'''Aranakin:''' Yes, yes! Paimon the White Floaty can be smart sometimes!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, that probably came out wrong, but thanks!
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, I'll cherish it.
:{{DIcon}} We can sing it together sometime.
:'''Aranakin:''' Yes, together!
