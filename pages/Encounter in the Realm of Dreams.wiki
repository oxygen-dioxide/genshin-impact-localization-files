{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On accepting quest)
:{{A|vo mzklq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know where we haven't been in a while? Inazuma.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Might be nice to get a change of scenery. Come on, let's go!

;(Approach the teleport waypoint)
:;(The time turns to night)
:{{A|vo mzklq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, remember when we chased that [[tanuki]] down this way? Good times!
:{{A|vo mzklq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What's that?
:{{DIcon}} A tanuki?
:{{DIcon}} A piglet?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't think they look anything like that... Oh, maybe there's a new kind of youkai in town?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm.... Is it trying to get us to follow it?

;(Approach the cliffside)
:{{A|vo mzklq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's that girl doing over there?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She doesn't look well... Let's go check on her.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What just happened? All we did was lock eyes with her for a split-second, and then...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, where did all these people come from? And what are they here for?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like they're waiting in line for some reason.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' True... Oh, and there's that girl! She's still here. Hmm, maybe she knows what happened?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 tejima 01.ogg}} '''Tejima:''' If I leave now, will I have enough time?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 shigeru 01.ogg}} '''Shigeru:''' How many times do I have to explain?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 sanada 01.ogg}} '''Sanada:''' There's no going back if I report him. But still...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hmm... anxiety over a lack of creative inspiration... Well, inspiration tends to give anxious minds a wide berth, so I hope our treatment will help you relax.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 wakamurasa 01.ogg}} '''Wakamurasaki:''' ...Thank you.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Remorse for the misdeeds of the past, and despair over the sorry state of the present... I can help you face your troubles with a more positive mindset, but you'll need to work through things in your own time, too.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 nishiguchi 01.ogg}} '''Nishiguchi:''' ...Many thanks.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Next please! *cough*...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's wrong with her?
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''???:''' I'm fine. Next, please...
<!-- A good dream emerges from the Traveler -->
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Mmm! Delicious!
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, that was unexpected...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Huh? What do we have here... *burp*! Oh no, I'm so sorry...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry for what? We have no idea what's going on here, let alone what you're sorry for. Would you mind bringing us up to speed?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''???:''' It looks like you entered my dream by mistake. Let me wake you up, then I'll explain everything.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dream? When did that&mdash;
<!-- They gaze deep into Mizuki's eyes -->
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hi! Feeling more awake now? Heh, I never expected {{Traveler}} to literally come to me in a dream.
:{{DIcon}} How do you know who I am?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh, someone I know talks about you all the time. Plus... I'm pretty good at profiling people based on their reputation.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So who are you?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Right, of course. It's our first time meeting each other, so I should introduce myself properly.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' My name is Yumemizuki Mizuki &mdash; or just "Mizuki" for short. I'm a yumekui-baku, which is a kind of youkai here in Inazuma.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yumekui-baku?
:'''Little Baku:''' *hum*
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, it's that little critter from before...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That's what we look like in our original form. I'm guessing that's the one that led you into my dream earlier?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Baku feast on the bad dreams of human beings &mdash; but we need to be in a dream of our own to digest them. The place where you met me earlier was where I go to digest bad dreams.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I must have swallowed one too many bad dreams, because they were causing me some digestive trouble... It's actually a good thing you showed up when you did.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Call it a happy accident, I guess. Thanks to your help, I'm now able to digest all these dreams properly.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we thought you looked a little uncomfortable. That's why we came over. We didn't know what it was, we just thought maybe you could use some help.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And Paimon really hates bad dreams, so Paimon's even more happy to help knowing that you can eat them!
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Thank you... but I still owe you an apology...
:{{DIcon}} For what?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' While you were inside my dream... I ate one of your dreams, but it wasn't a bad one. It was a nice one.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 11.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I've eaten so many bad dreams today that I just scarfed it down without noticing...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So yumekui-baku can eat good dreams too, huh... Still, is that really such a big deal?
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 12.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Of course it is. Dreams are some of the most precious things a person can have, and I just went and gobbled it down...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 13.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' It's the unwritten rule of my kind: Never eat someone else's good dreams without permission. I can't believe I was so careless.
:{{DIcon}} Don't beat yourself up.
:{{DIcon}} I feel fine.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 14.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' But... Don't you feel horribly depressed? Isn't your mind suddenly flooded with distressing memories?
:{{DIcon}} Nope.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 15.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Remarkable... I've never heard of someone remaining so mentally stable after having a good dream of theirs devoured...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm... It's probably because {{Traveler}} has too many good dreams to count!
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 16.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Maybe, but I still owe you something for your trouble... Ah! Here, take this.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a VIP pass for the Aisa Bathhouse...
::{{Readable|title=Aisa Bathhouse VIP Pass
|text=<!--
-->[[File:Item Aisa Bathhouse VIP Pass Image.png|200px]]}}
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Staffed by clinical psychologists and offering spa and fine dining services, we invite you to bring us your troubles and leave refreshed and renewed"...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 17.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That's where I work. You'll find the address on there, too.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 18.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' This invitation letter entitles you to enjoy our highest-tier service, free of charge... Oh, and speaking of work &mdash; I'd better get back before I'm missed.
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 mizuki 19.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Hope to see you as customers soon!
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So she's a yumekui-baku that eats bad dreams and a clinical psychologist, too?
:{{DIcon}} It adds up.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah. Kinda cool...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's never considered therapy before. Then again, Paimon never really gets that stressed out. Except when she's trying to decide what to eat...
:{{A|vo mzklq001 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of eating &mdash; that bathhouse place does fine dining, and we have a VIP pass. That means we can eat as much as we want, right? This is the opportunity of a lifetime! We can't let it go to waste!
