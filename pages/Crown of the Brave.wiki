{{Description|A rough-and-ready laurel wreath that seems as precious as a king's golden crown.}}
'''Crown of the Brave''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Brave Heart]].

==Description==
The little hero entered the deep, mysterious forest, and henceforth walked the path of resistance.<br />His best playmate played the role of the champion knight of the aristocracy.

"Like a lion I stride the battlefield, like she did a thousand years before."<br />"Songs I will inspire with my sword, to give to generations to come."

Their toy greatswords and tree branches clashed in their fierce duel—<br />Till at last the hero won the day, and seized the aristocrats' crowns from their heads.

Many years later, this wreath of flowers, though crudely made,<br />Would seem more precious still than the power a master of knights held...
