==Profile==
It is a [[Secret Source Servant]] prototype that was created by [[Xiuhcoatl]] to assist with information recording. It initially describes itself as "unnamed," as well as the only intelligent Secret Source Servant without a designated master.

Once its data is fully retrieved, it recalls being named after the kinsman that Xiuhcoatl cherished most and had accompanied him since birth: [[Kukulkan]].

===Appearance===
It is slightly larger than other Secret Source Servants, apparently because subsequent models were purposefully made smaller in order to not "usurp" its "magnificence."

;(Talk to the Secret Source Servant)
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Greetings. New data recovery category detected.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Thank you... for your help. I have... recalled my name from the retrieved data.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' At the time, my creator, Lord Xiuhcoatl, was exhibiting signs of memory degradation and distortion, and the kinsman he cherished most had already severed ties with him...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Perhaps he meant to fill the void left by one who had accompanied him since birth, and thus, on the day I was created...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' "Then, you shall be 'Kukulkan'. I imagine that fellow could hardly care less about that name by now..."
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' As such, I am not a nameless Secret Source Servant. Rather, my name is...
:'''Kukulkan:''' "Kukulkan."
;(Subsequent interactions start from here)
:'''"Kukulkan":''' Do you have any queries?
:{{DIcon}} Let's access the data we've recovered...
::'''"Kukulkan":''' Reading corresponding content... What records do you need to access?
::{{DIcon}} Read me the entries marked "Creating the Secret Source Servants..."
:::'''"Kukulkan":''' Of course. Now reading, please wait.

-->Moreover, my pitiable brother, lost to delusions... Know that your descendants merely copying your prototype blindly, having no comprehension of its significance.<br><!--

-->Yes... The city itself is built of data sectors made manifest... so if the sector containing the prototype's data has been corrupted, the name cannot be read, and therefore cannot be changed.<br><!--
-->I wonder... What name did you give this machine?<br><!--
-->Or have names themselves lost all meaning in this place? Perhaps you never gave it a name to begin with...}}
