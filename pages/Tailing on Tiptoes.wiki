'''Tailing on Tiptoes''' is [[Yaoyao]]'s [[Utility Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* When a character interacts with any Wildlife, nearby Crystalflies and Loaches will become [[startle]]d and start to flee, while other types of Wildlife will not become startled. Crabs may still flee under certain conditions, such as if they are near other wildlife that is startled, like birds.
