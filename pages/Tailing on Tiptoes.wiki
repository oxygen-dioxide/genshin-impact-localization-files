{{Description|"Even though the sound of bells follows Yaoyao wherever she goes, the wildlife is never disturbed by her presence."|2=[[Dainsleif]] in [https://youtu.be/g5fw5RAtl34 Collected Miscellany - "Yaoyao: Sweet Clouds of Osmanthus"]}}
'''Tailing on Tiptoes''' is [[Yaoyao]]'s [[Utility Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* When a character interacts with any Wildlife, nearby Crystalflies and Loaches will become [[startle]]d and start to flee, while other types of Wildlife will not become startled. Crabs may still flee under certain conditions, such as if they are near other wildlife that is startled, like birds.
