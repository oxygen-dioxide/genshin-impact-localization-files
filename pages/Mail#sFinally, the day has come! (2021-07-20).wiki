|text    = Hey, pal! How have you been? You must have traveled far and wide since we last saw each other, right?

For me, I can only seek out some entertainment for myself.

These past couple of days, I've used a work opportunity to explore [[Dragonspine]] and seek out some local specialties. I hope they will be of use to you.

The harsh cold of the snow-capped mountains is reminiscent to the scenery of my [[Morepesok|hometown]]...

Sigh, I've had many mundane days that makes me nostalgic of our time together. Whether it's a fight or a challenge, I always feel that having you around is what makes life really interesting.

Haha, to be honest, I've been planning a special day to meet up with you, today could be that chance!

If you have no special plans, how about you swing by my place?
