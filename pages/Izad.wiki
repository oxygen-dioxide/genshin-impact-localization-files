:'''Izad:''' An unusual floral fragrance permeates the air... I really would love to stay a little longer.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Izad knows; Version 1)
:::'''Izad:''' I heard from some students passing by that some ores appeared in a place nearby. They were so absorbed in discussing a problem that they didn't watch where they were going and tripped over some Magical Crystal Ores.
:::'''Izad:''' I could help clean them up if I had my tools with me... I can tell you the location if you want to check it out.
:::'''Izad:''' Ores are pretty useful. You need them too, right?

:::'''Izad:''' If you like flora and fauna, there are plenty of things to see.
:::'''Izad:''' But it's impossible for me to name every one of them... Hehe, best to ask a Forest Watcher for that.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Izad:''' I'm a Forest Ranger of [[Avidya Forest]]. I'm in charge of liaison between the Forest Rangers and Pardis Dhyai.
::'''Izad:''' We send regular reports on the ecological situation in Avidya Forest to Pardis Dhyai, and Pardis Dhyai provides us with all kinds of assistance.
::'''Izad:''' For example, we recently received quite a bit of seeds and nutrients that Pardis Dhyai supplied for free.
::'''Izad:''' The Forest Rangers are in charge of selecting suitable planting areas or distributing the seeds to the nearby villagers, so that we can all add a little more green to the rainforest.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Izad:''' Slow down and appreciate the flowers and plants here.
