====AI Logic====
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.
* '''Spirit Combo: Triple Quake''' is controlled by the Spirit of Omen's AI. For more information, see [[Spirit of Omen: Stone Drake#AI Logic]].

===Warrior's Spirit===
In the [[Warrior's Spirit]] event, the event exclusive character [[Younan]] is fought on Round 3. His moveset are as follows:
{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Eremite Stone Enchanter Event

|name_1      = Tremors
|desc_1      = Causes two trails of explosions. Each explosion deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

|name_2      = Melee Combo
|desc_2      = Performs two melee strikes, dealing '''75% ATK''', '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. The 2nd strike will not be used in Normal and Hard difficulties.

|file_3      = Eremite Stone Enchanter Event Jumping Slam
|desc_3      = Jumps into the air and slams down at the player's location, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. This attack is only used in Hard difficulty.

|name_4      = Ultimate Technique: Spinning Charge
|desc_4      = The Eremite Stone Enchanter has a [[Fury]] meter that fills by '''1''' point when hit by the player's attacks.
* The Fury meter's maximum will change depending on the difficulty:
** Normal: '''10''' points
** Hard: '''15''' points
** Pro: '''20''' points
* If the player stops hitting the Eremite Stone Enchanter for 3 seconds, the Fury meter will deplete by '''3''' points every '''3s'''.
* When the Fury meter reaches its maximum, spins his weapon wildly and charges at the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} with each spin. At the end of the charge, performs an additional slash, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. [[Parry]]ing this attack will trigger a counterattack.

Will work for anyone as long as the pay is good.<br>In ancient days, these heavily-equipped warriors were the domain of the personal, trusted guards of the [[King Deshret|Lord of the Blazing Sun]]. It is perhaps on this account that they gleam like the golden sun itself to this day.<br>Ominous, fragmented spirits are sealed within the weapons they use, awakening in moments of peril.
