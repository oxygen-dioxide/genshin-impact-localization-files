'''Millelith Soldiers''' can be encountered in certain [[Archon Quests]] as enemies. All of them attack the Traveler with their trademark spear. Despite appearing as enemies, [[Millelith]] cannot be found in the "Living Beings / Enemies and Monsters" section of the [[Archive]], likely due to the fact that there is no way to fight them outside of specific Archon Quests.
