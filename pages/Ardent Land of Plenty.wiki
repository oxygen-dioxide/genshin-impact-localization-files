:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello there! Um...
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hm?
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh, are you lost? Need some help?
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not lost... exactly. We're on our way to the Collective of Plenty. Is this the right direction?
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Yep! That's my home tribe, actually. I can take you the rest of the way, if you want.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Score! Another local guide! We really lucked out!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 04.ogg}} '''???:''' A guide, huh... Yeah, sure! Why not? Hehe, from now on, I'll be your guide!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 05.ogg}} '''???:''' There's a lot of cool scenery around here, actually. I can point it out along the way. It always leaves people in awe!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's so nice! But, um... We're not keeping you from anything, are we? You really don't have to go out of your way...
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh no, not at all! I was just doing some training, but I'm all done for the day. So, I'm heading in that direction, too.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 07.ogg}} '''???:''' Plus, I can teach you all about the tribe. Besides, learning new things is always fun, right?
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 08.ogg}} '''???:''' As long as you're happy, I'm happy. That's how Uncle Acatl teaches us to treat our guests.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A&mdash;Alright...
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She seems super friendly and welcoming.
:::{{DIcon}} Yeah, we lucked out.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Definitely! Paimon really likes her.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 09.ogg}} '''???:''' All good over there? Then, let's head out!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, wait! We still don't know your name.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Ah, right! The name's Varesa. Nice to meet you!
::;(If the player has completed [[All Fires Fuel the Flame]]){{Verify}}
::::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we know that name! So, that's you!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 10b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, this is {{Traveler}}, and Paimon's Paimon, {{MC|m=his|f=her}} awesome travel companion.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' {{Traveler}} and Paimon... Now, that has a nice ring to it!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Let's get going!
:;(If the player has completed Incandescent Ode of Resurrection)
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello there! Um...
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hm?
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Wait, you're... {{Traveler}} and Paimon! I've been waiting for you!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! You know us? Huh, we've really made a name for ourselves...
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but... Did we even tell anyone we were coming to the Collective of Plenty?
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh, you didn't know? Coach [[Iansan]] said she invited you to our tribe, so I came out here to wait for you while I did some training.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 04.ogg}} '''???:''' And now, you're actually here... Hehe, I can't believe it! This is great!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' S&mdash;Surely we're not THAT big of a deal...
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 05.ogg}} '''???:''' You're the heroes who defeated the [[Abyss]]! You're a huge deal to everyone in Natlan! I've heard the story of "{{Rubi|Tumaini|Hope}}!"{{Sic|expected=no "!"}} so many times, I can practically recite it by heart!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I've been so excited to meet you ever since Coach Iansan told me you might be coming. Oh, my name's Varesa, by the way. Not sure if Coach mentioned me before...
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, the name sounds familiar!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' During the Abyss invasion, we asked Iansan if the Collective of Plenty needed any help, but she said that Varesa had it all under control.
:::{{DIcon}} Which means, you must be an impressive warrior yourself.
:::{{DIcon}} And a hero in your own right.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Not really. It was all Uncle [[Acatl]]! All I did was clear out a few monsters.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Just thinking about the invasion gives me chills even now...
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' But, that's in the past, the Collective of Plenty fared pretty well, all things considered. We finished our repairs, so now it's just a matter of helping out the other tribes.
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, c'mon! I'll take you to our camp!
:::{{A|vo vrslq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Let's go!

;(While following Varesa)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 3 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, just a heads up &mdash; the volcano sometimes sends rocks crashing into this area. We call them "[[Pulverite]]."
:{{A|vo vrslq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... You seem way too calm about that! It sounds super dangerous!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 3 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, you think so? Well, we're used to it. If we see one, all we need to do is smash it to pieces.

;(Follow Varesa to a pile of Pulverite)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 4 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, here's one! Wanna give it a try?
:{{A|vo vrslq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not in a million years!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 4 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You can use your shoulders, if you want. Or your feet. Or even your head!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That doesn't change anything!

;(Break the Pulverite, optional)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 5 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' See? There's nothing to it!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, there's treasure inside these rocks...
:{{A|vo vrslq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so maybe a little pain isn't too bad...

;(Follow Varesa to another pile of Pulverite)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 6 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hey, there's another one over there. Wanna give it a try?

;(Approach Varesa)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... What's this wooden plank doing here?
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, it's a piece of training equipment! I use it all the time.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Training equipment?
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah! It's kinda hard to explain... Lemme show you instead. Here goes nothin'!
:;(Varesa launches herself off the ramp)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' And she sticks the landing!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you jumped over that huge gap just like that? Incredible!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, no, no! Anyone can do it with a bit of practice.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You made it across without any training at all. That's a lot more incredible than anything I can do.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, well, Paimon can fly, but... You've got a point!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, about what you told us earlier... You're saying, a gigantic rock could crush us at any moment?
:{{A|vo vrslq001 8 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Well, not "at any moment"! It's a pretty rare phenomenon. Many adventurers come here and never even get to see it. So, I wouldn't worry too much.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;Yeah, okay... It's not like we're THAT unlucky...

;(Approach the marked location)
:;(A boulder rolls down the mountain towards them)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, come on! SERIOUSLY!?
:{{A|vo vrslq001 9 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, don't be scared! Just charge straight at it!!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What!?
:;(Varesa smashes the boulder)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew! Thanks for that... Paimon can't believe you smashed something that big in a single hit...
:{{A|vo vrslq001 10 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' It was nothing! All it takes is a bit of training.

;(Approach the [[hilichurls]])
:{{A|vo vrslq001 11 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hilichurls? Hmm, it's too much of a hassle to deal with them. Let's just ram straight through!

;(Defeat the hilichurls, optional)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 13 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hey, you guys are good! Color me impressed!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 13 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Looks like they're blocking the road in and out of the tribe, so we'll have to get rid of them sooner or later. Alright, let's hurry &mdash; we're almost there.

;(Approach the Collective of Plenty)
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Ah, home sweet home! We made it! Welcome to the Collective of Plenty!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this place is so cool! That platform shaped like the head of a bull is awesome!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, that's the [[Resonating Arena]]! It's where we hold all our competitions.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for bringing us here.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Don't mention it! It was no trouble at all.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I wish I could show you around, but I need to get home.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, did you remember something important? You really hit the ground running when we ran into those hilichurls back there...
:{{DIcon}} Hope we didn't hold you up.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh no, not at all! We made it in time! There's just something important I have to do... The most important thing after training &mdash; the post-workout meal!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Otherwise, I'll be a lethargic, dizzy, hunger-addled mess. The perils of an empty stomach... It's terrible.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Anyway, I'm sorry, but I've gotta get some food in me... like yesterday! You should grab something, too!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' We can meet back up at the arena! See you soon!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And, she's off...
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, talk about whiplash... One second she's chill and laid-back, and the next she's charging head-first into danger... literally!
:{{DIcon}} It's the spirit of youth.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The spirit of youth? Sure, whatever you say, old-timer... Paimon thinks we're still young!
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, why don't we take a look around in the meantime? We can head to the arena in a little bit.
:{{A|vo vrslq001 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The view must be amazing from up there!
