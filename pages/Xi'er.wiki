==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Xi'er:''' This'd be so much better with some chilis added, I wonder if I should say something...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Xi'er:''' Oh, hello. You're visiting here, too?
::'''Xi'er:''' I'm Xi'er, from Chihu Rock in Liyue. My job is eating! Wait, no, there's a word for it... Gourmet! I'm a professional gourmet.
::'''Xi'er:''' I'm in Mondstadt specially to try the food. Mostly because I heard that Chef Xiangling from Wanmin Restaurant gets some of her ingredients from here.
::'''Xi'er:''' I like that there's a focus on fresh, quality produce...
::'''Xi'er:''' But in terms of presentation and seasoning, I gotta say Liyue is a cut above, regardless of whether you're talking about Li or Yue cuisine.
::{{DIcon}} Li cuisine?
:::'''Xi'er:''' Yep, one of the two big culinary traditions in Liyue!
:::'''Xi'er:''' Li-style cooking is all about rich, indulgent dishes packed with flavor. It uses a lot of ingredients from up in the mountains.
:::'''Xi'er:''' The place you should go to try it is Liuli Pavilion in Liyue Harbor. They have the best Li-trained chef working for them.
::{{DIcon}} Yue cuisine?
:::'''Xi'er:''' One of the two major culinary traditions in Liyue, the other being Li.
:::'''Xi'er:''' Yue-style cooking puts emphasis on lighter, brighter flavors. It's heavily seafood-based, so if that's your thing you have to try it!
:::'''Xi'er:''' If you do want to try it, the most authentic Yue-style cooking is at the Xinyue Kiosk in Liyue.
:::'''Xi'er:''' Only thing is, for both the Xinyue Kisok and Liuli Pavilion, you have to book about half a year in advance...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Surely you're exaggerating...
:::'''Xi'er:''' Exaggerating? I'm just saying the plain old truth.
:::'''Xi'er:''' I am a native of Liyue, but as a gourmet, I am nothing if not fair and impartial!
:::'''Xi'er:''' It's just as well that I made some Black-Back Perch Stew this morning. Have a taste &mdash; you should be able to tell the difference right away.
::;(Obtain [[Black-Back Perch Stew]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Xi'er:''' Getting hungry yourself now too, huh?
