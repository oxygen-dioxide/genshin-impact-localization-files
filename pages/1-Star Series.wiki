The '''1-Star Series''' ''(unofficial name)'', as the name suggests, is a 1-star [[Weapon]] series. It is the only 1-star weapon series in the game. No other 1-star weapons exist except the weapons in this series.

This series does not have a shared [[Weapon#Passive|passive]], because 1-star weapons do not have passives at all. However, all weapons in this series have a shared base [[Attributes#Attack|ATK]] of 23 at Level 1.

Likewise, the weapons in this series cannot be [[Weapon#Refining|refined]]. This is a feature exclusive to 3-star weapons and above.
