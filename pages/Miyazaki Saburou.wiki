==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Hello there, Traveler from afar. If you are here to see me, does that mean you are interested in the swords and blades of Inazuma?
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Miyazaki Saburou knows; Version 1)
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Earlier, when I was gathering materials, I heard that there were some ore veins nearby that even contained some Magical Crystal Ore. Those are some sort of mutation of ordinary Crystal Ore, though they are very difficult to process...
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' If I remember right, they should be around here. I've marked them on your map now, so if you do need them, go have a look.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Miyazaki Saburou knows; Version 2)
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' When I was out gathering materials previously, I heard that some purple, crystalline ores were discovered nearby.
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' I wouldn't call them equal to Jade Steel, but they have their uses, I think.
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' If I remember right, they should be around here. I've marked them on your map now, so if you do need them, go have a look.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Miyazaki Saburou knows)
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Well, you'd be hard-pressed to find something that isn't noteworthy in a military encampment, I reckon.
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' My only concern now is to forge the weapons I am charged with well. I care little for the rest.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you, again?
::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' I am a swordsmith from [[Tatarasuna]] and a successor of the Miyazaki Art.
::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' I have been under the protection of the Sangonomiya troops ever since the war broke out. Therefore, I decided to join them and offer them support in terms of weapons and equipments.
::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' If you want to ask about the forging secrets of the Miyazaki Art, I'm afraid that I can't tell you. But if you want to learn about the history around here on the other hand, I have some tales to tell.
::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' I have been around for long enough, after all, to know a little more than others. Hahaha.
::{{DIcon}} Could you tell me more about [[Kannazuka]]?
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Kannazuka is disputed territory between the Shogunate and Sangonomiya. Actually that place belongs neither to the Shogunate who worship the Raiden Shogun, nor to Sangonomiya, who worships [[Orobaxi]].
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' That's why this place is called Kannazuka, which means "the hill where no gods reside."
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' At Kannazuka, if you walk past the camp in the east and head southwest, you will find yourself in Tatarasuna.
::: {{DIcon}} Who's this Orobaxi I've been hearing about...
::::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' The residents of Watatsumi Island worship Orobaxi, a dragon-like serpent god who guided them back in the day.
::::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Orobaxi taught them how to farm and how to smelt. Therefore, the people of Watatsumi Island are very grateful towards Orobaxi, worshiping it as their guardian deity.
::::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Later on, a great battle broke out between Orobaxi and the Electro Archon, and Orobaxi was slain in that conflict.
::::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Fort Mumei was left in the ruined state we see today because of that battle. And the [[Musoujin Gorge]] next to it was a scar left by the Electro Archon when she delivered a blow from her Musou no Hitotachi, slaying the serpent.
::::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Until now, Orobaxi's remains can still be seen on Yashiori Island. Those giant snake bones are the remnants of that god.
::: {{DIcon}} I'd like to hear about Tatarasuna...
::::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' The [[Mikage Furnace]] there is infused with technology from Fontaine. It is the smelting center of Inazuma. Before the incident happened, I worked over there.
::::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' There is an island called [[Nazuchi Beach]] to the west of Tatarasuna. It is part of [[Yashiori Island]].
::::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Nazuchi Beach is also a chaotic place plagued by war. There are even some pirates who managed to set up their lair over there during the tumult. If you can't handle yourself well, it is very dangerous to go that way.
:;(Before completing Orobashi's Legacy)
::{{DIcon}} Is there anything you can tell me about Yashiori Island?
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' You have probably already been to the places around the Sangonomiya camp, right? If you go further south, there are some place of interest on the other side of Musoujin Gorge. I wouldn't recommend going there though.
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Inside [[Higi Village]] across the valley, I hear that the villagers have caught some strange illness. Those who could flee already have. The remaining bunch have gone quite mad.
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' It's probably because the village lies too close to the remains of gods and demons, so they were haunted by the [[Tatarigami]].
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' I've heard a god's power will still linger around even if they have already been slain... So for your own sake, don't go further south.
:;(After completing Orobashi's Legacy)
::{{DIcon}} About the situation on Yashiori Island...
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Hmph. I'd only recently heard of that myself.
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Although I don't know the exact details...
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' But I do know a thing or ten about those young idiots on Watatsumi Island!
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' They learned nothing of Watatsumi's legacy, even going out and doing such a disgraceful thing!
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' *sigh* If the Watatsumi Omikami praised in our songs heard of their terrible deeds, surely he too would weep in anger and grief...
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Watatsumi has suffered great humiliation under the rule of the Shogunate, yes... But paying back blood with blood was not Omikami's way.
:::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Thankfully, Her Excellency stopped those radicals in time. I only hope that they will learn their lesson and grow up...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Miyazaki Saburou:''' Goodbye. Watch out for your safety around here.
