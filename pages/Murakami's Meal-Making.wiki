'''Murakami's Meal-Making''' is a weekly [[Reputation Request]] that occurs in [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
#Give fifteen [[Mint]]s to [[Murakami]]

==Request Details==
Help Needed:<br />
I'll bet that everyone's sick of [[Tonkotsu Ramen]] or [[Mixed Yakisoba]] by now, eh?<br />
It's time for some new flavors! Like... uh, has anyone tried putting [[Mint]]s in those?<br />
No? Well, I'll do it then. Please help me find {{Color|buzzword|15 Mints}}, and I'll use 'em to experiment on my new dish.<br />
If it's popular, you can come have a try. I'll even give you a 50% discount!
