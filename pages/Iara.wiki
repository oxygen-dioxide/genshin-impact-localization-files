==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Iara:''' Ooh, it's you, my teacher! Are you going to teach me some of your brilliant fishing techniques today too?
:{{DIcon}} How have things gone for you, recently?
::'''Iara:''' Yup. After learning what you taught me and scattering lots of bait, I learned how to attract fish.
::'''Iara:''' But catching them can still be pretty tough. Haven't caught too many, but the fish in the surrounding waters sure did get plumper &mdash; that's something, I guess?
;(After Step 3 of ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Iara:''' Argh, it was so intense that all the fish got scared off!
::'''Iara:''' Hmm, speaking of that... Did it happen just as [[Delaroche]] said it might? Did a whole school of Linebreakers strong enough to shake Merusea Village appear?
::'''Iara:''' If that's the case, all the more reason for me to guard this fishing spot. I'll show them the strength of my will!
:{{DIcon}} Just passing through today...
::'''Iara:''' Oh, no worries then, but please do come fishing with me next time. That way, I'll be able to learn more techniques, and also share in the fish you catch.{{Dialogue End}}
