==Lore==
The Underground Lava River is the true location of the "Mysterious Island" in the legends of the [[People of the Springs]]. That is, it is the only known location of '''Vulcanite''', a rare type of glowing golden crystal formed by quickly cooled Liquid Phlogiston. This crystal is seemingly impossible to obtain, as it only forms at the start of fierce volcanic activity, and is thus quickly swallowed up by the ensuing lava flow.<ref name="MIT"/>

==Trivia==
* [[Koholasaurus|Koholasaurs]], including [[Koholasaur Whelp]]s, live in this cave. It is unclear what they do when the cave periodically fills with lava.
