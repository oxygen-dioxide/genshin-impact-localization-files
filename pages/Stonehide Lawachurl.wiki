{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Geo Lawachurl

The ground-slam will cause two trails of explosions, dealing '''33.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} if the Stonehide Lawachurl is in its '''Stone Force State'''.
|file_1 = Geo Lawachurl Punches

|name_2 = Infused Stonehide
|desc_2 = Generates a {{Geo}} shield and enters the '''Stone Force State''' for as long as the shield is active. Under this state, it will use more powerful attacks. This shield will degrade over 90 seconds and can be further damaged with [[Poise Damage]]. [[Blunt Attack]]s are most effective against the shield.

|file_2 = Geo Lawachurl Geo Enhanced State

|name_3 = Dash

|file_3 = Geo Lawachurl Dash

|name_4 = Shockwave
|desc_4 = Roars and slams both hands into the ground, causing 3 trails of explosions, dealing '''33.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

The third consecutive attack in the 3-hit combo has its explosion AoE increased.

|name_5 = Jumping Slam
|desc_5 = Roars and jumps into the air, slamming down at the player's position, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. If the Stonehide Lawachurl is in the '''Stone Force State''', the attack can be done up to 3 times and the impact causes 4 trails of explosions around the Lawachurl, dealing '''33.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.
|file_5 = Geo Lawachurl Jumping Slam

|name_6 = Slime Throw
|desc_6 = If the player is at a higher elevation or too far away, the Lawachurl will roar and grab a [[Large Geo Slime]] from the ground, throwing it at the player to deal '''83.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. If the Stonehide Lawachurl is not in the '''Stone Force State''', throws 3 [[Geo Slime]]s toward the player, each dealing '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A mysterious "lord" of hilichurls that walks between a thousand peaks.<br>This huge hilichurl is referred to as a "lawa" by its brethren. The abundant Geo energies in the environment have become part of their flesh, blood, and skin, which look as if they were chiseled out of mountain rock.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==

*The Stonehide Lawachurl has the most voiceline variety out of all of the other Lawachurls.
*The Stonehide Lawachurl is currently the only Lawachurl without a Berserker combo.
