==Description==
The life of a Hilichurl is brutal and short, a maxim that holds true even for Mitachurls. Only the most powerful and cunning Mitachurls survive long enough to reach their full potential. As the years pass by, Mitachurls skilled enough to survive their harsh conditions attune with the land and grow a carapace of Geo armor. Revered for their wisdom and immense strength, Stonehide Lawachurl are role models for every young Hilichurl.

==Abilities and Attacks==
* '''Punches:''' Roars and performs a punch with its left arm. It occasionally combos with both arms and slams the ground, dealing '''75% ATK''' and '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. The ground-slam will cause two trails of explosions, each dealing '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', or '''5% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.

* '''Geo Enhanced State:''' The Stonehide Lawachurl can generate a {{Geo}} shield, enabling it to use more powerful attacks. This shield will degrade over 90 seconds and can be further damaged with [[Poise Damage]]. [[Blunt Attack]]s are most effective against the shield.

* '''Dash:''' The Stonehide Lawachurl quickly charges at its target after a roar, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Stonehide Lawachurl is in the '''Geo Enhanced State'''.

* '''Shockwave:''' Roars and slams both hands into the ground, causing 3 trails of explosions, each dealing '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', or '''5% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Stonehide Lawachurl is in the '''Geo Enhanced State'''.

* '''Jumping Slam:''' Roars and jumps into the air, slamming down at the player's position, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. If the Stonehide Lawachurl is in the '''Geo Enhanced State''', the impact causes two trails of explosions, each dealing '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', or '''5% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.

* '''Slime Throw:''' If the player is at a higher elevation or too far away, the Lawachurl will roar and grab a [[Large Geo Slime]] from the ground, throwing it at the player to deal '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. If the Stonehide Lawachurl is <u>not</u> in the '''Geo Enhanced State''', throws 3 [[Geo Slime]]s toward the player, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.

==Strategy==
The Stonehide Lawachurl does even more damage and has more health than a Mitachurl of the same level. It can charge at the player or jump onto the player to deal heavy impact damage. It generally does not use elemental attacks. When it encounters a target, it will enhance itself by making it much more stronger and resilient. At this stage, the Lawachurl may plunge the ground, causing multiple blasts to erupt from the ground which can be very devastating if left unchecked. They may also sometimes dig into the ground and throw a Large Geo Slime in front of it.

As with all other [[Geo Constructs]] and Geo shields made by enemies, the Stonehide Lawachurl's armor is weak to [[Interruption Resistance#Poise Damage|Poise Damage]]. Attacks that deal high Poise Damage can help break it efficiently.

==Trivia==
*Stonehide Lawachurls, alongside their other Lawachurl brethren, used to be exclusive to one nation, that being Liyue. However, the addition of [[Enkanomiya]] added one spawn inside, making them the only Lawachurl type to exist in multiple nations.
**A Stonehide Lawachurl appears in [[Mondstadt]] during [[Noelle]]'s [[Hangout Events|Hangout Event]] "[[Strength Training]]" but is quest-exclusive.
**Some Stonehide Lawachurls were also found in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]], but it was event-exclusive.
