{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xingxi:''' [[Mingxing Jewelry]] is well established within the industry, even if we are only taking advance orders on gems right now. We do have some other items in stock however.
:{{DIcon|Souvenir}} What do you have on offer?
::'''Xingxi:''' Other than gems, a few odds and ends. Are you a traveler? Perhaps I have something that could be of use to you.
:;(Opens [[Souvenir Shop]])
:{{DIcon}} You're only taking advance orders on gems?
::'''Xingxi:''' I apologize for the inconvenience. We often find ourselves unable to meet the demand for our goods here at Mingxing Jewelry...
::'''Xingxi:''' As you will already know, Liyue is famed for its ceramics &mdash; they can only be fired locally due to the unique properties of the soil here.
::'''Xingxi:''' Some would go so far as to say that Mingxing Jewelry is in a league of its own in the trade. Wealthy merchants will travel from all corners of Teyvat just to purchase a single Lucent Crescent from us. It is the quintessential Liyue ornament.
::'''Xingxi:''' We were caught by surprise when the mines at [[The Chasm (Area)|the Chasm]] were closed. All of a sudden, we had no suppliers.
::'''Xingxi:''' As you can see, only a few display items remain in stock. Though if you were to insist on buying one, the price would be... Hmm, forget it. Hearing the figure would only upset you.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about Mingxing Jewelry.
::'''Xingxi:''' Mingxing Jewelry is a Liyue trader of precious stones and gems that has been around for hundreds of years.
::'''Xingxi:''' You could say it is the Rex Lapis of the market for precious stones. It is the only store of its kind, and it has been in business continuously since the day it was founded.
::'''Xingxi:''' Have you ever heard anyone mention our Lucent Crescent ornaments? They are especially popular with young people.
::'''Xingxi:''' We produce a very limited quantity of Lucent Crescent &mdash; only ten per month. People say that if you manage to purchase one of them, you are sure to win the heart of your beloved...
::'''Xingxi:''' Interested? Heh... Whether what they say is true or not I don't know, but I do know that I, personally, would be won over if someone was to buy one for me...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Xingxi:''' Take care. Once our stocks recover I will be sure to inform our regular customers.

==Event Dialogue==
===Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} {{Color|help|We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.}}
::'''Xingxi:''' A music festival, you say? Thank you. I do confess to being in the habit of collecting Radiant Spincrystals...
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, then you must have music you really enjoy, right? We could play it for you &mdash; we're serious musical types!
::'''Xingxi:''' Oh? really? Well, there is this one tune... What say I hum it for you, and you play it for me in turn?
::{{DIcon}} Sure, I'll give it a go.
::'''Xingxi:''' Thanks for your trouble.

;(After performing)
:'''Xingxi:''' Ah, now that brings back memories! It reminds me of how when I was young, I would wake up very early to attend calligraphy classes at my teacher's place. It was so early, that it was still dark out, and it was terribly frightening.
:'''Xingxi:''' Fortunately, I would pass by the house of an old granny, and I could often hear this song drifting out from her home. It would give me a sense of peace.
:'''Xingxi:''' That dear old lady probably isn't with us anymore, but I've also grown, and I'm no longer as afraid of the dark, haha...
:'''Xingxi:''' In any case, I've given it some serious consideration, and while I'd love to agree, it's going to be tough finding someone to watch a time-honored store like ours on such short notice.
:'''Xingxi:''' So let me recommend someone else to you who might attend instead &mdash; [[Xigu Antiques]]'s boss, [[Linlang]].
:'''Xingxi:''' She doesn't even open in the daytime, and you can either find her sleeping or wandering the streets &mdash; I reckon she'd have the free time to help.
:'''Xingxi:''' Regardless, thank you so much for letting me hear that song again. I hope your musical venture goes well!

;(Talk to Xingxi again, optional)
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} How was that?
:;(Same as ''After performing'')
