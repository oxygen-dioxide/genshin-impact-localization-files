The '''Illegible Notes''' is a Quest Item that initiates the Event [[World Quest]] "[[A Trip Through Fog and Wind]]." It can be found in the cave in [[Twinning Isle]] by the [[Twinning Isle Mural]].

==Text==
"If we wish to leave this place, we have to find a way to break through this fog, somehow..."<br />
"Who knew that such a sight could be seen on that rock to the northwest. I'd love to bring her to see it too. I think it happened at... around 11{{colon}}00?"<br />
"A short-lived gap sometimes appears in the fog over the northeasterly island. Who knows, we might be able to use this to leave these islands..."<br />
"...The wind, that's right! If we could use the wind, we might be able to charge through. But the wind direction in this part of the sea is very strange. We have to get the timing right. Perhaps the wind at around 12{{colon}}00 might be more suitable..."
