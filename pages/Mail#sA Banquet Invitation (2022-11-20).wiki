|text    = I didn't plan to organize something big for my birthday this year, yet my friends have already prepared a banquet for me in secret.

I can hardly refuse their passionate offer, and it's a rare opportunity to chat with people in a relaxing atmosphere.
They've also asked me if I have any wishes. Well, I can't think of anything at the moment. After all, it's always been my motto to "act without hesitation and leave no regrets behind."

That's why I thought of you. A birthday without you would be such a regret. That's why I'm writing this brief invitation
on short notice. I do hope you can show up.
I look forward to meeting you at the banquet.
