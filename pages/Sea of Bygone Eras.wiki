==Descriptions==
{{Description|The wide waters that lie south of the Great Terrestrial Lake were also once an integral part of that high sea. Beneath the abyssal depths untouched by sunlight, the first of dreams and hopes lie buried.<br>The long-forgotten symphony sounds once more amidst the stronghold of dimmed glories and the sea-sunken ruins. A new chapter in a tale long-ended is about to be written...|The Undersea Capital, the Lost Homeland}}
{{Description|The citizens of Remuria, who once prided themselves on their civilization and glory, firmly believed their empire would rule eternal. As long as the God King's melody continued to play upon the golden throne, their flourishing laws would stand unshaken, like a fortress of white stone and bronze. Yet, all that ancient pride and hatred eventually sank below the towering waves, leaving only a tranquil, salty breeze, as gentle as it had ever been in days long past.|[[Map]] marker description}}
