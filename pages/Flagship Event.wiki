==Trivia==
* Flagship Events typically alternate between giving the player a free 4-star [[character]] or [[weapon]]. An exception to this are [[Version 3.0]] and [[Version 4.0]], both of which gave out a free 4-star [[character]] after the preceding Flagship Event had done the same.
* [[Iridescent Arataki Rockin' For Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness]] in [[Version 4.6]] is the first Flagship Event to give an [[Inazuma]] character even though Inazuma was released in [[Version 2.0]].
