==Trivia==
* Flagship events typically alternate between rewarding a character and rewarding a weapon. The only exception is the [[Summertime Odyssey]] and [[Graven Innocence]] events in [[Version 2.8]] and [[Version 3.0]], respectively, which were back-to-back events that both rewarded characters.
