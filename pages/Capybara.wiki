|description = These herbivores, which often dwell close to the water, are famous for their steely, stoic "won't even twitch if lightning strikes right next to their toes" disposition. Tourists consider them to be the paragon of animal friends.<br>Capybaras like to zone out while having a soak in the water, or sun themselves on the shore, and it's quite common for them to barely move for most of the day, as though not a single thing in the world could possibly perturb their calm demeanor and make them anxious. Despite their fluffy appearance, their hairs are actually quite hard and tough. If you pet them in the same direction as their coat of hair, it feels relatively smooth, but should you pet them in the opposite direction, you may end up with a scratched hand. Perhaps that is the reason even famished predators do not regard these completely harmless and quite defenseless little friends as prey...
