|text      = The [[Court of Fontaine]] has been quite quiet lately, nearly without any incidents major enough to require the [[Special Patrol]]'s involvement. Perhaps it's because we recently solved a series of serious cases in such rapid succession? As a result, I'm planning on giving the squad members a little R&R.

But just as I was scheduling shifts, someone in the squad managed to magic up some mousse out of nowhere... And I suddenly remembered that today is my birthday. After so long in the Special Patrol, I'd nearly completely forgotten about it.

The cake tastes great! You should have a bite, too.

But cakes like this are calorie bombs, and it's best if you don't eat too much. If you don't mind, you can join the squad and me for some drills. Nothing too intense, we'll just do a quick 10km run and a few dozen sets of endurance exercises first to burn off the extra calories.
