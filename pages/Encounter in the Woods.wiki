{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Arakavi)
:'''Arakavi:''' It's [[Arama]] and the Golden Nara. You are so tall. But the silver one by your side...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? What about the silver one?
:'''Arakavi:''' How should I put it... You must be able to squeeze into the narrowest tree hollows. How convenient!
:'''Arama:''' Well, based on Nara customs, we should do introductions first. This is Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon. This is [[Arakavi]]. You guys shake hands.
:{{Black Screen|You are a little lost, but you shake hands with Arakavi anyway...<br>You try not to use too much strength.<br>Arakavi's hand feels... interesting to the touch.}}
:'''Arakavi:''' How fascinating. I've heard a lot about Nara before, but this is the first time I've ever touched one. It's a very special feeling!
:'''Arakavi:''' It's been a long time since we last hosted a Nara here. Many seeds have grown into trees, and many stories have become legends. That Nara was a good Nara &mdash; or so we've heard.
:'''Arama:''' Nara {{Traveler}} is good, too. Strong and brave, like a sapling sprouting out of a rock wall. And they are here to help Arana.
:'''Arakavi:''' Ah, Arana... It's been a while since we last met. I hope all is well, and that the little Nara at Vimara Village are well, too.
:{{DIcon}} You know the kids of Vimara Village?
:'''Arakavi:''' Of course I do!
:'''Arama:''' We all do! Arana came back and told us stories about the little Nara. Nara [[Iotham]], Nara [[Bahram]], and [[Rana|Narana]] are our friends.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's not sure that counts as "knowing someone"...
:'''Arakavi:''' What counts, then? Do we need to "shake hands" after the "introduction" like Nara do?
:'''Arama:''' I know what Paimon means. Nara eat and look for "treasures" together. Then they know each other, right?
:{{DIcon}} It's not quite that simple, either...
:{{DIcon}} How should I explain this...
:{{DIcon}} I eat and search for treasures with Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Yes! And we're not just "people who know each other," but the best of companions!
::'''Arama:''' Good for you, Nara {{Traveler}}, Paimon!
:'''Arakavi:''' As long as we know each other's stories, we know each other. This is because the Aranara's world is a place for songs and dreams.
:'''Arama:''' Arakavi is right. As long as we hear about Nara {{Traveler}} through songs and see what Nara {{Traveler}} looks like through dreams, it'll count as knowing you.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks that we can leave this aside for now... After all, we're already friends!
:'''Arama and Arakavi:''' Good friends!
:{{DIcon}} Good friends!
:{{DIcon}} Now let's talk about business...
:'''Paimon:''' Yes. Since we're going to celebrate [[Festival Utsava]], Arakavi needs to make some preparations!
:'''Arakavi:''' That's true. We need the [[Bija]], right? I've sent [[Arayasa]], [[Aradasa]], and [[Arasudraka]] to look for [[Ashvattha's Concourses]].
:'''Paimon:''' Spot on! But Paimon's wondering... Why don't you guys know where these concourses are?
:'''Arama:''' Ashvattha's Concourses are very, very sacred places. We don't usually go there. We would prefer to let the [[Vasara Tree]]s sleep and dream, until all memories come together in [[Sarva]].
:'''Arakavi:''' The forest will remember. No good thing will ever fade away, and all suffering will come to nourish something beautiful...
:'''Arakavi:''' Anyway, you can find Arayasa, Aradasa, and Arasudraka looking for Ashvattha's Concourses out there. Arama, you go and help them.
:'''Arama:''' I will. If Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon run into us in the forest, we can go adventuring together!
:'''Arakavi:''' Very well. Nice to have met you, Nara {{Traveler}} and Paimon!

;(Talk to Arakavi again)
:'''Arakavi:''' Nice to meet you! When Festival Utsava comes, we shall sing together in happiness!
