{{Dialogue Start}}
::(A piece of paper that has been well-preserved due to the closed-off environment. The words look half-written, half-drawn...)
::How many days has it been since the rockfall trapped me here?
::Real shame I couldn't have caught another eye-full of that ancient excavation site. Why, if I had, the drawing on this wall would definitely...
::Haha, I'm incorrigible, thinking about those paintings even now.
::My old friends and elders just didn't get why I wouldn't simply practice the art of Phlogiston Engraving. Why I just had to turn it into these pictures and graffiti... but of course they wouldn't. How could those rigid lines ever compare to the soft touch of light and wind? How could those stiff turns compare to the traces of flowing water or falling leaves?
::I have exhausted all the phlogiston available to me for engraving, and I know that in truth, I should have my work more beautiful and moving still.
::Some believe that Phlogiston Engraving is just a tool. That beauty is superfluous to a tool.
::But some... So I hope, so I hope, that some will, in the future, enjoy this art form I have devised, that the ink I have spilled these past ten-odd years will not have been spilled in vain.
::There is, of course, a high chance that the paintings on these stone walls will disappear with the wind and rain.
::But &mdash; and work with me here &mdash; what if this art form could be understood &mdash; popularized, even?
::Or perhaps the tales the storytellers tell are true, that stones can indeed speak... and that hundreds, thousands of years from now, new life could be born from these pictures!
::"Ah, what a shame!" &mdash; Can't help feeling like that right now. But first, let's figure out how to finish these wall paintings, eh?
::&nbsp;
::A graffiti maker, who accomplished nothing&mdash;
::Bah, my name's not worth mentioning
