'''Tonia''' is one of [[Tartaglia]]'s younger siblings, alongside [[Anthon]] and [[Teucer]].<ref name="Tartaglia Intro">HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/75641 Secrets From the Depths of Winter]</ref>

==Profile==
Tonia is the third-youngest child in her large family, only older than Teucer and Anthon. She is extremely close with Tartaglia and holds him in high regard.<ref name="Tartaglia Intro" /> He, in turn, is deeply fond of her and always writes to her when he sends letters home, in which he addresses her as "Dearest Sister" and himself as her "loyal knight."<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/3f2-EANyrNM Character Demo - "Childe: A Letter to Snezhnaya"]</ref><ref name="Tartaglia CS Bonus">{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|Tartaglia's Letters to Home}}</ref>

During [[Labyrinth Warriors]], Tartaglia takes fondly to Xinyan's form of address for him &mdash; Brother &mdash; as it reminds him of Tonia.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Tricky Situation}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* In the original Chinese dialogue for [[Labyrinth Warriors]], [[Xinyan]] calls Tartaglia {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|小哥||Chinese}}|zh_rm=xiǎogē|zh_lit=young big brother}}, which is a form of address for young men who are slightly older than the addresser, regardless of familial relation. When referring to a family member, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=小哥}} refers to the youngest of one's older brothers &mdash; which Tartaglia is to Tonia &mdash; although she typically uses {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|哥哥||Chinese}}|zh_rm=gēgē|zh_tl=big brother}} to refer to him.

===Etymology===
* Anthon and Tonia are both names derived from {{w|Anthony}}, itself derived from the surname ''Antony'' which is said to have been named after the descendants of Anton, a son of {{w|Heracles}}.
