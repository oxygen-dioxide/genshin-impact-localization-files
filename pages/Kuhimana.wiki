==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kuhimana:''' Hello... Have we met before?
:'''Kuhimana:''' Apologies, recognizing people isn't my forte...
:{{DIcon}} Is it your eyes?
::'''Kuhimana:''' It's not exactly a problem with my eyesight. I'm just bad at remembering people's faces.
::'''Kuhimana:''' Sometimes, I meet people who I've met many times before, even chatted with, yet I still can't remember their faces...
::'''Kuhimana:''' I find it even harder when they're wearing different clothes or accessories.
::'''Kuhimana:''' But then when it comes to animals, I'm sensitive enough to always tell them apart.
::'''Kuhimana:''' Hehe, I've done a lot of sketches of them, and I've given each one a special label of their own!
::{{DIcon}} Have you tried doing sketches of people?
::'''Kuhimana:''' In all honesty, I've tried. But I couldn't even sort the labels out correctly, let alone still recognize them the second time we met...
::'''Kuhimana:''' Sometimes, there'll be two people who were wearing hats of a similar color, and I'll accidentally sort them into the same book.
::'''Kuhimana:''' As time has gone by, everyone who knows me knows I have this issue, so they don't take it personally when I fail to recognize them.
::'''Kuhimana:''' On the contrary, they're all quite happy to have someone like me around who's good at telling animals apart.
::'''Kuhimana:''' In their eyes, all animals of any given species look exactly the same! Boggles the mind, doesn't it?
:{{DIcon}} It's fine.
::'''Kuhimana:''' Well, I shall look forward to seeing you again next time. I just hope I'll still be able to recognize you.
