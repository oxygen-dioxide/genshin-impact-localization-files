==The Old World==
{{main|Timeline#The Old World}}

==The New World==
{{main|Timeline#The New World}}
* '''400 years after the Primordial One appeared''' ― The region of [[Enkanomiya]] was part of the single, unified human civilization which spanned the whole world.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref><ref name="SubterraTrials">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref>
* '''Second Throne of the Heavens''' ― The war between the [[Primordial One]] and the [[Second Who Came]] ravages the heavens and earth. Enkanomiya falls into the depths of the ocean and is severed from the surface world.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/><ref name="3 Martial Trials">{{Ref/Quest|The Three Great Martial Trials}}</ref>

==Divine Envoy Era==
''Note: It is currently assumed that the Divine Envoy Era occurred after the Second Throne of the Heavens since Enkanomiya, which fell during that conflict, is said to have minimal influence from divine envoys.''<ref name="SubterraTrials"/>

===Enkanomiya===
* The people of Enkanomiya clash with the [[Dragonheir of the Depths]], vishaps who fled into the ocean depths after the Primordial One defeated the [[Seven Sovereigns]] of the old world. Because there was no light in the ocean depths, the vishaps had a great advantage.<ref name= "Before Sun and Moon">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref>
** [[Istaroth]], the undying wind and presumably one of the Primordial One's four shining shades, is the only one who does not forsake the people of Enkanomiya,<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/> as they are able to detect her undying wind from the depths of the ocean.
* The sage [[Aberaku]] (originally known as Abrax) builds the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] (which he dubbed "Helios"), creating artificial light to drive away the vishaps. It is believed that Istaroth granted Abrax wisdom.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/><ref name="Tokoyokoku">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|1|The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku}}</ref>
* '''1 year after the Dainichi Mikoshi's construction''' ― People attempt to find the way back to the surface, but are unable to. They interpret this as a ban from the Primordial One, and that meant the Primordial One had defeated the [[Second Who Came]].<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/><ref name="Tokoyokoku"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― A cabal of corrupt nobles<ref name="Lotus">{{Ref/Quest|Lotus Eater}}</ref> manipulates the people of Enkanomiya into worshipping the Dainichi Mikoshi as a god, and chose a child to be the [[Sunchild]] and rule over the land.<ref name="Hyperion">{{Ref/Quest|Hyperion's Dirge (Quest)}}</ref> The Sunchildren were puppet rulers controlled by these nobles. Abrax, and later Spartacus ([[Supada no Hiko]]), opposed the corrupted nobles only to be imprisoned by the Sunchildren.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/><ref name="Lotus"/>

===Other Islands of Inazuma===
''Note: It is unclear when the following civilizations existed, so they have been tentatively placed under the Divine Envoy Era.''
* A civilization in [[Tsurumi Island]] was built and had connection with [[Celestia]]. A similar civilization was found beneath [[Seirai Island]].
* '''? years ago''' ― In the area that is now north of [[Mt. Yougou]], [[Narukami Island]], a kingdom built on sand had a foolish ruler who wanted to build a high garden in honor of the white sakura tree. The kingdom was swept away by floods.<ref name="SandCourt">{{Ref/Domain|Court of Flowing Sand}}</ref>
* '''? years ago''' ― A great flood ravaged the land, leaving only a few islands left.<ref name="ViolCourt">{{Ref/Domain|Violet Court}}</ref> These islands are likely [[Narukami Island]], [[Kannazuka]], [[Yashiori Island]], [[Seirai Island]], and [[Tsurumi Island]]. ([[Watatsumi Island]] was created by [[Orobashi]] towards the end of the Archon War, and therefore does not exist yet.<ref name="SangoChron">{{Ref/Book|Sangonomiya Chronicles}}</ref>)

==Pre-Archon War==
* '''? years ago''' ― The [[Tanuki]], creatures native to Inazuma, evolve and gain sentience. The [[Kitsune]] immigrate from mainland [[Teyvat]] and attempt to colonize the islands, instigating a war between the Tanuki and Kitsune over control of Inazuma.<ref name="Toki Alley Tales">{{Ref/Book|Toki Alley Tales}}</ref><ref group="Note">''Toki Alley Tales'' is a relatively unreliable source that has little information that can be cross-checked. As a result, while its account of Inazuma's history has been recorded, its veracity is highly questionable.</ref>
** '''1600 years later''' ― The Tanuki-Kitsune War finally comes to an end after 1600 years of fighting after negotiating a truce. The Tanuki refuse to admit a loss in the war but cede the "giant [[Thunder Sakura]]" (likely the [[Sacred Sakura]]) to the Kitsune. Over the course of the war, the tanuki and kitsune's constant transformations and trickery lead members of both groups to become confused on their original identities and allegiances; this resulted in the emergence of humans.<ref name="Toki Alley Tales"/>

===Tsurumi Island===
* '''? years ago''' ― The civilization on Tsurumi Island comes to an end through unknown means.
* '''? years ago''' ― An eagle known as the [[Kanna Kapatcir|Thunderbird]] spots a fog-covered Tsurumi Island and decides to make its home there. At some point, objects fall from the heavens &mdash; possibly the [[Divine Nail]]<ref group="Assumption">[[Celestia]] is depicted in one of the murals below the island, and the object fits the description of the nail.</ref> &mdash;, one of which lands on Tsurumi Island. This temporarily clears up the fog, only for the fog to return in even greater force later.<ref name="SunwheelKanna">{{Ref/Quest|The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna}}</ref>
**Humans on the island begin gathering the Thunderbird's shed feathers and worship it, but the bird does not think much of them. The people learned to use [[Maushiro]] to locate each other amidst the fog, and they feared and worshipped the eagle. However, the Thunderbird paid them no heed, seeing them as no different from other animals.<ref name="SunwheelKanna" />

==The Archon War (?–2000 years ago)==
* '''~2000 years ago''' ― The twin gods [[Raiden Makoto]] (Baal) and [[Raiden Ei]] (Beelzebul) slay all other gods in the Inazuma region. Ei, although the stronger fighter, believed Makoto to be better-suited for the role of Archon and sacrifices her body so Makoto can ascend to [[Celestia]]. Makoto becomes the first Electro Archon, the God of Transience.<ref name="Treasured Tales 1">{{Ref/Book|Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi|1}}</ref><ref group="Lore Discrepancy">According to Yae Miko in [[Wishes (Quest)|''Wishes'']], Makoto and Ei "won the Archon War together," whereas Treasured Tales indicates that Ei technically "lost" the Archon War by sacrificing her body so Makoto could ascend. Based on current prevailing in-universe sentiment that the Archon War had a "last man standing" rule, and lore about [[Andrius]] choosing death so he would not become the Anemo Archon, the wiki assumes Treasured Tales' account is correct.</ref>
** Makoto uses her new powers to recall Ei's divine will and reforge her body. Ei becomes her ''kagemusha'' (body double),<ref name="Treasured Tales 1" /><ref name="AQ2-3-8">{{Ref/Quest|The Omnipresent God}}</ref> and most people in Teyvat gain the impression that there was only one god, Baal (also referred to as the Narukami Ogosho, Raiden Shogun).<ref group="Note">While Baal is Makoto's Goetic name and Ei's is Beelzebul, Zhongli refers to Ei as "Baal" in ''[[The Fond Farewell]]'' and [[Venti]] and [[Zhongli]]'s Voice-Overs about Ei are both titled "About Baal." Given that they are aware of the distinction between Makoto and Ei, it is presumed that they continue to use Makoto's title for Ei out of respect for the twins' decision.</ref>
* '''~2000 years ago'''<ref group="Assumption" name="OroFlees">It is unclear when exactly Orobashi fled to the Dark Sea and later created Watatsumi Island, or when it was defeated. Orobashi peacefully lived under Baal's rule for a while, which means it was alive after Makoto ascended to Electro Archon, but it was stated to have died ''during'' the Archon War. This indicates that both Makoto's rise to Electro Archon ''and'' Orobashi's death occurred before the official end of the Archon War 2000 years ago.</ref> ― [[Orobashi]] flees from an unknown region to the nation of [[Enkanomiya|Byakuyakoku]], specifically [[The Serpent's Bowels]]. It stayed there for a while until a child from the underground nation found it and asked it to become their gods. Together they fought the Sunchild's reign and came out victorious,<ref name="Tokoyokoku"/><ref name="The Moon-Bathed Deep">{{Ref/Quest|The Moon-Bathed Deep}}</ref> after which it became known as "Orobashi no Mikoto" and the "Watatsumi Omikami" (Great God of the Oceans).<ref name="Jade Branch">{{Ref/Item|Jade Branch of a Distant Sea}}</ref>
** It is supposed that the ban placed by the [[Primordial One]] must have been weakened to allow Orobashi to fall to Byakuyakoku.<ref name="3 Martial Trials">{{Ref/Quest|The Three Great Martial Trials}}</ref>
** Orobashi supposedly stayed with the people for a while before leading them back to the surface. It used its power to bolster the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] to have stronger light, and eliminate the threat of the [[Dragonheir of the Depths]].<ref name="Tokoyokoku"/><ref name="PS2021-12-26">PlayStation Blog: [https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/26/genshin-impact-version-2-4-brings-grand-celebrations-and-a-mysterious-new-area-to-teyvat/ Genshin Impact version 2.4 brings grand celebrations and a mysterious new area to Teyvat]</ref> It also supervised the research of the Dragonheirs, now called [[Bathysmal Vishaps]].<ref name="BathVishap Records">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records}}</ref>
** The Divine Priestess was chosen among the sea-daughters who collected pearls,<ref name="heal">{{Ref/Arti|Deep Palace's Plume}}</ref> and was likely the origin of the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]. Other clans like the [[Yuna Clan]] also originated from Enkanomiya.
** Orobashi had its people adapted to [[Narukami Island|Narukami]]'s language and culture to be prepared for a new life above the sea.<ref name="BathVishap Records"/>
** Orobashi creates [[Watatsumi Island]] out of the coral that grew from its body, allowing them to live above the surface once more as part of the Inazuma archipelago.<ref name="SangoChron">{{Ref/Book|Sangonomiya Chronicles}}</ref><!--duplicated named ref to allow for transclusion, do not remove-->
*** On the last day of Enkanomiya before the people relocated above the sea, envoys from [[Khaenri'ah]] along with a [[Ruin Guard]] came and stole the book [[Before Sun and Moon]], a book that Orobashi personally placed a ban. [[Antei]] fought them and prevented the loss of the book, but was also critical injured.<ref name="Antigonus">{{Ref/Quest|Antigonus}}</ref>
** Orobashi's people call this land Sangonomiya, and themselves the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]. They begin calling Byakuyakoku, "Enkanomiya," to contrast it with Sangonomiya.<ref name="The Moon-Bathed Deep" />
* '''? years ago''' ― The [[Kitsune Saiguu]] is born in the Hakushin Lands.<ref name="NCotSK5">{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|5}}</ref><ref group="Assumption">Ei, Chiyo, the Kitsune Saiguu, and Sasayuri are depicted together in [https://youtu.be/ydPqFAEgHzs ''Character Teaser - "Raiden Shogun: Nightmare"''], which indicates they were all alive before the war against Orobashi, during which Sasayuri lost his life.</ref>
** The Kitsune Saiguu and the [[bake-danuki]] [[Ioroi]] often compete with each other. One day, Saiguu decides to trick both Ioroi ''and'' Baal at the same time: she challenges Ioroi to pluck a [[Naku Weed]] from the [[Tenshukaku]] gardens. When Baal catches him in the act and nearly kills him for it, Saiguu comes to his rescue and persuades Baal into not only sparing him, but also putting him under her command as the Hidden Protector of the Grove, the protector of [[Chinju Forest]].<ref name="Hakushin Ring">{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring}}</ref><ref name="Ioroi">{{Ref/NPC|Ioroi}}</ref>
* '''? years ago''' ― The [[Sacred Sakura]] grows from "her" body after "her" death;<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|Interesting Things}}</ref> at this point, the tree does not have a fox-like appearance.<ref name="Promise of a People's Dream">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/hQ5GEOlwLUQ Story Teaser: Promise of a People's Dream]</ref>
** Above is the knowledge of people (excluded [[Ei]]) who lived before and in the cataclysm. The true Sacred Sakura was not planted until the present.<ref name="RadiantSakura">{{Ref/Quest|Radiant Sakura}}</ref>
** A ritual involving the worship of both the Raiden Shogun and [[Orobashi]] is developed. This ritual must be performed before starting any other ritual. The Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is also developed at some point, presumably after the aforementioned ritual.<ref name="Cleansing Summary">{{Ref/Book|Sacred Sakura Cleansing Summary}}</ref>
** The [[Thunder Sakura]] are planted across [[Narukami Island]], using branches of the Sacred Sakura and parts of the Electro Archon's own spirit, to absorb filth from the land.<ref name="Cleansing Summary" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Strange Story in Konda}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sakura Arborism}}</ref>
* '''~2000 years ago'''<ref group="Assumption" name="OroFlees" /> ― After Watatsumi Island's infertile land leads to years of famine and disease, Orobashi reluctantly agrees to the Watatsumi people's plan to invade and conquer part of [[Yashiori Island]]. A brutal war erupts between Watatsumi and the Narukami Shogunate, led by [[Ei]], which ends with Orobashi slain and Watatsumi's major figures either dead or Missing in Action.<ref name="APSSFB">{{Ref/Book|A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief}}</ref>
** Major figures on the Narukami side, not including Ei:
*** The Great [[Tengu]] [[Sasayuri]], Ei's lieutenant. He is slain during battle, likely against [[Akuou]], who had sought a "joyful" duel against him.
** Major figures on the Watatsumi side, not including Orobashi:
*** The shrine maiden [[Mouun]] was particularly skilled in the [[Yuna Clan]]'s whale-songs and employed the aid of a massive whale. She taught [[Akuou]] and was close to him. During the war, she and her whales were ambushed and killed by Sasayuri's subordinates, and their bodies were taken away by the Shogunate.<ref name="Life of Mouun">{{Ref/Book|The Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden}}</ref>
*** "Umigozen" [[Ayame]], Mouun's twin sister. She was the general of the Watatsumi navy, and disappeared in the midst of battle with her fate left unconfirmed.<ref name="Life of Mouun" />
*** The "Viceroy of the East" [[Akuou]], also known as Touzannou. Was found as an orphan and taken in by Orobashi, and later trained under Mouun. He conquered one of the mountains on Yashiori Island, which the Watatsumi people called "Touzan" (Eastern Mountain), and built the [[Formation Estate]] on top of it. He was ultimately slain alongside Orobashi when Ei used her ultimate technique, [[Musou no Hitotachi]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Debates on the "Viceroy of the East"}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Akuoumaru}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Domain|Formation Estate}}</ref>
** Some believe that Orobashi participated in this war, despite oracles of its inevitable failure, due to an order from [[Celestia]].<ref name="APSSFB" />
*** It was revealed that since Orobashi had contacted with the people of Enkanomiya, both Orobashi and Watatsumi as a whole were found guilty of four counts of profanity and eight counts of deceiving living souls. Orobashi was allowed to take all of their transgressions on itself and sacrifice itself so its people would be spared and taken under the rule of Celestia once again.<ref name="SubterraTrials"/>
* The [[Tatarigami]] supposedly spawned after the death of Orobashi in [[Yashiori Island]]. [[Ei]] created wards called [[Narukami Pillar]] to suppress the soul of Orobashi, hence subduing the Tatarigami, while the Yashiori Guardians led by the Kitain Clan also took up the mantle of suppressing the Tatarigami.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|3}} </ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Orobashi's Legacy: Part V}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Kitain Cross Spear}}</ref>

===Tsurumi Island===
*'''<2,600 years ago'''<ref group="Assumption">Kanna Kapatcir tells Ruu that she heard "the melodies sung by the blue flying dragon of the far north." This dragon is currently believed to be [[Dvalin]], who descended onto Mondstadt after [[Barbatos]] became Anemo Archon. Assuming that is correct, this means Ruu lived sometime after Barbatos ascended 2,600 years ago.</ref> ― [[Ruu]] is born among the people of Tsurumi Island and makes preparations to participate in the rituals to the Thunderbird. While practicing his singing, the Thunderbird overhears him and is captivated by the sound of his song. Ruu attempted to befriend the god and give her the name "Kanna Kapatcir," as the Thunderbird had forgotten her own name. They promised to meet each other again in the future.<ref name="SunwheelKanna" />
* However, as the situation on the island worsened and many islanders left only to never return &mdash; which people took as a sign that they had died, when in actuality they had settled onto the other islands of Inazuma &mdash; Ruu volunteered to be sacrificed, believing this would please the Thunderbird and bring the missing people back. Instead, she becomes enraged upon witnessing his death, viewing his sacrifice as the killing of innocents and a promise broken, and retaliates by destroying the area and killing the entire tribe. To hear Ruu's singing again, she uses her powers to cause a ley line disorder, resulting in the entire island continuously reliving its day of destruction.<ref name="SunwheelKanna" /><ref name="TF">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Thundering Fury}}</ref> Afterward, the Thunderbird flies over to [[Seirai Island]].<ref name="SunwheelKanna" />

Unable to get her to show herself, however, he begins breaking the kitsune statues around [[Narukami Island]] and in one, finds an important-looking comb and steals it. The Shogunate learns of Ioroi's antics and dispatches Harunosuke, who had returned to Inazuma, to deal with Ioroi. Harunosuke seals Ioroi and many of the bake-danuki into stone statues.<ref name="Ioroi" /><ref name="Sacrificial Offering">{{Ref/Quest|Sacrificial Offering}}</ref>
** Sometime later, Harunosuke performs a Minor Cleansing with the help of [[Hanachirusato]].<ref name="Sacrificial Offering" />
* '''~400 years ago''' ― Ei's first prototype puppet awakens in [[Shakkei Pavilion]], having no name for himself and only a feather as proof of his connection to the Raiden Shogun.<ref name="Inversion of Genesis">{{Ref/Quest|Inversion of Genesis}}</ref> He is found by Mikoshi Nagamasa's yoriki, [[Katsuragi]], and joins the group consisting of Armory Officer [[Niwa Hisahide]], Inspector [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]], Katsuragi, [[Kinjiro]], [[Nozomu]], and Vice Armory Officer [[Miyazaki]] in [[Tatarasuna]].<ref name="HuskDreams" /> Others in the group refer to him as the "Kabukimono" (Japanese: 傾奇者 meaning "wandering eccentric").
** The Kabukimono is well received by the people of Tatarasuna, teaching him various skills, including forging swords. He becomes good friends with the people of Tatarasuna.
**Nagamasa forges his crowning achievement, the Daitatara Nagamasa. In their joy, Nozomu makes a painting of the nagamaki while Katsuragi and Kabukimono perform a sword dance.<ref name="RAN">Interactable: [[Rather Aged Notes]]</ref>
** A Fontaine mechanic, [[Il Dottore|Escher]], comes to Tatarasuna to collaborate. He implements some technologies to the Mikage Furnace, but this ended up releasing dangerous Tataragami and poisoning the people of Tatarasuna, and caused the Mikage Furnace to spew lethal doses of Tatarigami.<ref name="Inversion of Genesis" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales (Quest)}}</ref>
**Niwa sends people to Inazuma City for aid from the Shogunate, but none of them returns. Then Kabukimono is sent to Inazuma City for aid, but is rejected by the Shogunate because earlier in the same year, Ei's [[The Shogun|Shogun]] has activated and she has entered the [[Plane of Euthymia]]. Then Kabukimono asks for help to [[Yae Miko]], who does send aid to Tatarasuna, but they were all shipwrecked. Kabukimono is unaware of this, and considered that the Shogunate had abandoned Tatarasuna.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Plume of Luxury}}</ref>
**Meanwhile, Niwa confronts Escher, who then murders Niwa and reveals himself to be [[Il Dottore]].<ref name="Inversion of Genesis" /> He then, as Escher, lies to the people of Tatarasuna, claiming that Niwa fled Tatarasuna. When Kabukimono returns empty-handed, Escher told him that he has been tasked to disable the furnace, giving him a device to help absorb the miasma. After Kabukimono successfully disables the furnace, Escher reveals that inside the device was "a heart that Niwa took from the chest of one of his men", but in truth, Dottore had taken Niwa's heart and placed it into the device. Kabukimono, horrified of this, grows disdain for Niwa and humans, and leaves Tatarasuna.
**With Niwa's disappearance, Nagamasa, the second-in-command, becomes responsible of the events in Tatarasuna. Katsuragi is willing to face capital punishment in place of his master, and thus Nagamasa cleaves Katsuragi with the Daitatara Nagamasa before throwing the blade into the furnace.
**Nozomu throws himself into the furnace to save the blade but later dies from the wounds he sustained; Kinjiro afterwards hides the remains of the blade as well as Nozumu's painting in [[the Arsenal]].<ref name="RAN" /> Both Nagamasa himself and the Daitatara Nagamasa are thereon known as the [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]] (Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa).
**After Kabukimono leaves Tatarasuna, he encountered a [[Child|sickly child]] who is affected by the Tatarigami, his parents, likely workers of Tatarasuna, died of the same cause. Kabukimono and the child makes a promise to stay together forever.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref> But the child dies young due to the Tatarigami. Kabukimono enraged by this, burned the child's house down.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/AR2n2TsJuNE Character Teaser - "Wanderer: Ashes"]</ref> His hatred towards gods and humans grows further.
** After the events above, during his wanderings in Inazuma, Kabukimono names himself {{Lang|Kunikuzushi|ja=国崩|ja_lit=Country Destroyer}}.
***As a result of Scaramouche removing all information about himself from the Irminsul in [[Inversion of Genesis]], various aspects of the Tatarasuna incident and the fall of the Raiden Gokaden are vastly altered. All instances of Kabukimono or Kunikuzushi are entirely removed from history, and is replaced by entirely new characters. Dottore still caused the incident, but there is a "brave swordsmith" of the Hyakume Clan who rushed to the scene. He and Niwa both sacrificed themselves to disable the furnace, but neither of them survived.<ref name="A Dance of Destruction">{{Ref/Quest|A Dance of Destruction}}</ref>

==Recent Past (<100 years ago)==
* '''~100 years ago''' ― To enact his revenge against the "bladesmith," [[Scaramouche|Kunikuzushi]] masterminds the fall of the [[Raiden Gokaden]], eradicating three of the five schools before losing interest in and abandoning his project.<ref name="HuskDreams" /><ref name="YaeMikoS">{{Ref/CS|Yae Miko|5}}</ref> His revenge involved instigating a famous swordsmith, [[Akame Kanenaga]], to betray Inazuma;<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kamisato Ayaka|More About Kamisato Ayaka: III}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Kagotsurube Isshin}}</ref> because swordsmithing and the Raiden Gokaden are viewed as a cultural institution, they were under the jurisdiction of the [[Yashiro Commission]]. As a result, their inability to prevent the situation dealt a large blow to the [[Kamisato Clan]].<ref name="MoreAboutAyaka2">{{Ref/VO|Kamisato Ayaka|More About Kamisato Ayaka: II}}</ref>
** Yae Miko, predicting that the Kamisato Clan would play a major role in Inazuma's future events, intervened in the Kamisato Clan's judgement before the Raiden Shogun and spared them from punishment.<ref name="YaeMikoS" />
** The [[Kaedehara Clan]]'s head at that time, [[Kaedehara Yoshinori]], stops doing the smithing due to the fearful of Scaramouche's claim.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Palace, Dyed in Black}}</ref> His son [[Hisamichi]] attempts to revive the Isshin art, but to no avail.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared (Part 1)}}</ref> Eventually, the Kaedehara Clan's fortune keeps regressing, and when Yoshinori's great-grandson, [[Kazuha]], becomes the head, the clan has collapsed.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaedehara Kazuha|2}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaedehara Kazuha|About Kaedehara Kazuha: Samurai Nobility}}</ref>
**As a result of Scaramouche removing all information about himself from the Irminsul in [[Inversion of Genesis]], various aspects of the Tatarasuna incident and the fall of the Raiden Gokaden are vastly altered. All instances of Kabukimono or Kunikuzushi are entirely removed from history, and is replaced by entirely new characters. From Kunikuzushi being the one who masterminds the fall of the Raiden Gokaden, instead, a descendant of the "brave swordsmith" of the Hyakume clan is the one who masterminds it. When the descendant got to the Kamisato and Kaedehara clans, they retaliated, and killed the descendant.<ref name="A Dance of Destruction">{{Ref/Quest|A Dance of Destruction}}</ref>

-->
* '''1 year ago''' ― With the Fatui pulling the strings and manipulating the [[Tenryou Commission]] and [[Kanjou Commission]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Delusion (Quest)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Duel Before the Throne}}</ref> [[the Shogun]] suddenly institutes the [[Sakoku Decree]] to shut [[Inazuma]]'s borders and the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] &mdash; an order to seize all Visions within its borders.<ref name="TFFW">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> Furthermore, since then, no new Electro Visions are known to have appeared, though preexisting Visions can still be used.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Research}}</ref> [[Raiden Ei]] is aware that the Fatui are behind this, but does not deem them a threat towards Eternity and does not intervene.
** The [[Sangonomiya Resistance]] is formed to resist the Vision Hunt Decree. Since then, the Shogunate Army and the Sangonomiya Resistance have been at war, which has halted to a stalemate.
** Beside the Resistance, there is an [[Kazuha's Friend|individual]] who protested against the Vision Hunt Decree by declaring the [[Inazuma/Culture#Duels|Duel before the Throne]] against the Vision Hunters. However, he was lost against [[Kujou Sara]], the deputy of the Vision Hunters, and then he was executed by [[Ei]]'s [[Musou no Hitotachi]].
** The wards which suppressed Orobashi were destroyed by Orobashi fanatics with the help of [[Nathan]], a [[Fatui]] agent who infiltrated the [[Watatsumi Army]].<ref>Interactible: [[Serpent's Head#Waterlogged Note|Waterlogged Note at Serpent's Head]]</ref> This led to the Tatarigami spreading again.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Orobashi's Legacy: Prologue}}</ref>
** During the heat of the civil war, the [[Mikage Furnace]] began to malfunction, forcing [[Xavier]] to erect a safety dome to contain the [[Tatarigami]]. [[Tatarasuna]] stopped functioning and the evacuation was ordered.<ref name="WQS Tatara">World Quest Series: [[Tatara Tales]]</ref>

==Present (The Traveler's intervention)==
* The [[Vision Hunt Decree]] is abolished due to the joint efforts of the [[Traveler]], [[Yae Miko]], and the [[Watatsumi Army]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Chapter II}}</ref>
** [[La Signora|The 8th of the Fatui Harbingers, La Signora]], loses the duel against the Traveler, and is executed by the Raiden Shogun.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Omnipresence Over Mortals}}</ref>
**A ceasefire between [[Tenryou Commission]] and [[Watatsumi Army]] is agreed upon under the Traveler's witness.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|New Beginning}}</ref>
** The event in [[Transient Dreams]] takes place. The [[Sacred Sakura]] is planted and transferred to the past, [[Ei]] and [[The Shogun]] agreed on the new term of Eternity, and the [[Sakoku Decree]] was lifted.
* Along with [[Hanachirusato]], the Traveler performs the latest [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] at [[Narukami Island]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual}}</ref>
* Along with [[Xavier]], the Traveler resolves the incident at [[Tatarasuna]], regulates the [[Tatarigami]], and brings [[Mikage Furnace]] to function normally.<ref name="WQS Tatara" />
* Following [[Kaji]]'s instruction, the Traveler fixes numerous wards that were destroyed earlier, thus resolving the [[Tatarigami]] lingering in [[Yashiori Island]].<ref name="WQS Orobashi">World Quest Series: [[Orobashi's Legacy]]</ref>
* The Traveler helps reseal the [[Thunder Manifestation]] in [[Seirai Island]], bringing the end to the storm and [[Balethunder]] ravaging the island.<ref name="WQS Seirai" />
** After that, the Traveler investigates and discovers the truth of the fog in [[Tsurumi Island]]. They help the spirit of [[Ruu]] to fulfill the promise with [[Kanna Kapatcir]], and the spirit of the Thunderbird lifts the curse and fog of Tsurumi Island.<ref name="SunwheelKanna" />
* Through the request of [[Tsuyuko]], the Traveler is promoted as Watatsumi's hero to dive into [[Enkanomiya]] to retrieve [[Bloodbranch Coral]] which helps to stave off the spread of the Holy Soil.<ref name="The Moon-Bathed Deep"/><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Still Water's Flow}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|From Dusk to Dawn in Byakuyakoku}}</ref>
** The retrieval of the Bloodbranch Coral triggers the awaken of the Sangacorallia, Orobashi's second familiars. The Sangacorallia are creatures that break down raw, primitive elemental energy into the milder elemental energy of the human realm.<ref name="3RealmEve">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref>
** However, this time the [[Abyss]] cooperated with the [[Bathysmal Vishaps]], with the Bathysmal Vishaps gaining forces to rescue their imprisoned companions which were used the produce the branch, when the Abyss achieve safe passages through Enkanomiya. The relationship collapses soon enough, but the damages are done. The Abyssal energy hinders the effectiveness of this Sangacorallia's awaken cycle, and seemingly there will be no Bloodbranch Coral for subsequent [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]].<ref name="3RealmEve"/><ref name="3RealmAfter">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath}}</ref>
