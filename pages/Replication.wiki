'''Replication''' is a subsystem in the [[Serenitea Pot]] that allows players to share a Replica of an area with a Replica ID, which can be used by other players in their own Serenitea Pot. It is accessed from the same menu used to access the {{Icon|Adeptal Mirror}} [[Adeptal Mirror]].

Replica IDs can only be used on the same [[UID|server]] as the original creator.

==Creating a Replica==
After choosing an empty Replica slot, the player can choose an area of their exterior realm, or create one based on the interior. Interior replicas represent the entire house, and individual rooms cannot be shared.

A replica cannot be created while furnishings are being placed. Creating a replica also has a short cooldown.

Players can create up to 10 replicas total, after which replicas will need to be deleted in order to create more.

===Guest Replica Creation===
In the top right of the replica menu, players can decide whether or not guests can generate replicas. By default, guests cannot generate replicas. Each Replica ID can also have its sharing permissions disabled individually.

Creating a replica based on another player's realm (as opposed to using a code from a replica they generated themselves) requires visiting their realm. After visiting, a replica can be created and added to your replica menu. For all intents and purposes, after generating the replica, it is treated as though it came from your own realm, and will count towards your own 10-replica limit.

The host can set the permissions as:
* Authorization: Guests can generate Replicas
* Authorization: Guests cannot generate Replicas
* Authorization: Confirm to allow Guests to generate Replicas

==Using a Replica==
Replica IDs can be used by selecting the Use Replica ID button in the lower left hand corner. Using a replica will replace all furnishings in the area. It will also move the [[Main Building/Mansion|Mansion]] to the area if the replica contains a Mansion.

Replicas can only represent one area, and replicas built in one area cannot be copied to another area or realm. For example, a replica created in [[Silken Courtyard]]'s Kasumi Shoal can only be used in Kasumi Shoal by players who have unlocked Silken Courtyard.

To use the replica, players must have at least 90% of the furnishings, as well as any furnishings that have other furnishings on top.

The following issues can prevent a player from using a replica:
* Attempting to use a replica where over 90% of the furnishings are owned, but a missing furnishing has another furnishing on top of it, will give the [[error]] "Required furnishing(s) not yet obtained. Obtain the furnishing(s) before using." These furnishings are marked with an asterisk ({{Color|#CE7541|*}}). The asterisk is only visible if 90% of the furnishings are owned.
* Attempting to use a replica when the area already contains a Mansion (Main Building), but the replica does not, will give the error "Replica does not contain a Main Building. The Main Building will be missing and cannot be used upon application of this Replica." The player must move their main building to another area before using the replica.

===Using Own Replica===
Players can also use their own Replicas by previewing it from the menu. This allows players to back up previous builds and restore them at a later date.

Note that players cannot use their own numerical IDs to use their own Replica: restoring a replica ''must'' be done from the main menu using the Preview button, and not the "Use Replica ID" menu. Attempting to use the ID will result in the error "Replica Owned," even if the replica is not currently in the realm.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|1. The Serenitea Pot's host can save and generate Replicas of their current Realm Layouts: Each Replica can record the layout of a single outdoor area or all the rooms in the main structure.<br>2. After the Replica capacity is at its max, the host can delete their replicas to make room for more.<br>3.The host can apply a layout by previewing Replicas or apply furnishings corresponding to Replica IDs, or even modify their layouts by transferring the furniture in those Replicas to said layouts.<br>4. When using a Replica, the number of deployable furnishings will need to match the number of corresponding furnishings in the Replica and the key furnishings need to meet the standard amount.<br>5. One Realm Layout must have one, and only one, main mansion. Please take care to review the main mansion of a Layout before using it.<br>6. The host can stop sharing specific Replicas at any time and halt the sharing of Replica IDs as well.<br>7. The host can set guest privileges to allow for the independent generation Replicas under the conditions that it does not affect the access the host's friends might have to visit the Serenitea Pot.|"Replication" Feature Details}}

==Notes==
* [[Companion]]s are not included within Replicas and will not be copied over.
* Furnishings contained within [[Furnishing Subsystem]]s, such as fish added to [[Furnishing Subsystem#Ornamental Fish|Ornamental Fish Furnishings]] and parts added to [[Landscape/Curio|Curio]] furnishings, will not be copied. Only the original base furnishing will be copied. For example, [[Wooden Torso: Swagger]] would be copied, but [[Wooden Head: Ho Ho]] would not.
* It is not possible to tell the server that a Replica ID was created on, unlike how User IDs work.
