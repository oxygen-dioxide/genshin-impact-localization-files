'''Replication''' is a subsystem in the [[Serenitea Pot]] that allows players to share a Replica of an area with a Replica ID, which can be used by other players in their own Serenitea Pot. It is accessed from the same menu used to access the {{Icon|Adeptal Mirror}} [[Adeptal Mirror]].

Replica IDs can only be used on the same [[User ID|server]] as the original creator.

==Creating a Replica==
After choosing an empty Replica slot, the player can choose an area of their exterior realm, or create one based on the interior. Interior replicas represent the entire house, and individual rooms cannot be shared.

A replica cannot be created while furnishings are being placed. Creating a replica also has a short cooldown.

Players can create up to ten replicas total, after which replicas will need to be deleted in order to create more.

===Permissions===
Players can decide whether or not guests can generate replicas. By default, guests cannot generate replicas. Each Replica ID can also have its sharing permissions disabled individually.

==Using a Replica==
Replica IDs can be used by selecting the Use Replica ID button in the lower left hand corner. Using a replica will replace all furnishings in the area. It will also move the [[Main Building/Mansion|Mansion]] to the area if the replica contains a Mansion.

Replicas can only represent one area, and replicas built in one area cannot be copied to another area or realm. For example, a replica created in [[Silken Courtyard]]'s Kasumi Shoal can only be used in Kasumi Shoal by players who have unlocked Silken Courtyard.

To use the replica, players must have at least 90% of the furnishings, as well as any furnishings that have other furnishings on top.

Attempting to use a replica where over 90% of the furnishings are owned, but a missing furnishing has another furnishing on top of it, will give the [[error]] "Required furnishing(s) not yet obtained. Obtain the furnishing(s) before using." These furnishings are marked with an asterisk ({{Color|#CE7541|*}}). The asterisk is only visible if 90% of the furnishings are owned.

===Using Own Replica===
Players can also use their own Replicas by previewing it from the menu. This allows players to back up previous builds and restore them at a later date.

Note that players cannot use their own numerical IDs to use their own Replica: restoring a replica ''must'' be done from the main menu using the Preview button, and not the "Use Replica ID" menu. Attempting to use the ID will result in the error "Replica Owned," even if the replica is not currently in the realm.

==Notes==
* [[Companion]]s are not included within Replicas and will not be copied over.
* Furnishings contained within [[Furnishing Subsystem]]s, such as fish added to [[Furnishing Subsystem#Ornamental Fish|Ornamental Fish Furnishings]] and parts added to [[Landscape/Curio|Curio]] furnishings, will not be copied. Only the original base furnishing will be copied. For example, [[Wooden Torso: Swagger]] would be copied, but [[Wooden Head: Ho Ho]] would not.
* It is not possible to tell the server that a Replica ID was created on, unlike how User IDs work.
