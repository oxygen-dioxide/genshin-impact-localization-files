{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Weijin:''' Oh wow... Is it just me, or are there a lot more guests arriving to enjoy [[Lantern Rite]] than last year...?
:{{DIcon}} And what exactly is this stall?
:'''Weijin:''' Hello there! This is the "Gift Envelope Consultancy" specially set up by the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]]!
:'''Weijin:''' Do you know about gift envelopes? They are a tradition here in [[Liyue]].
:'''Weijin:''' We make them every Lantern Rite and give them to our family and friends, sending them our best wishes.
:'''Weijin:''' I'm sure you've seen that lots of tourists from other nations have arrived for this year's Lantern Rite, yes?
:'''Weijin:''' They're interested in gift envelopes, and they all want to give the tradition a try themselves... But understandably, they don't know the first thing about making them.
:'''Weijin:''' In response, the Ministry has sent me here to set up the Consultancy... on account of my penmanship, I guess?
:'''Weijin:''' Whether you want to make a gift envelope to send good wishes to kith and kin, or if you'd like to leave a commemorative envelope for yourself, you can come seek me out for help.
:'''Weijin:''' I can even help add Guyan Sigils to your envelope, or perhaps draw some patterns onto it... In these things and more, I shall help you as far as I am able.
:{{DIcon}} Do many people come to you for help?
:'''Weijin:''' Oh, lots. So many foreign guests have come in to have envelopes written up that I've had to get a new notepad just to record all their names.
:'''Weijin:''' But there are just way too many clients. Apart from those who request that I write everything for them, there are also many who ask for suggestions for their well-wishes...
:'''Weijin:''' I'd love to have someone to help me out here, but I am well aware the Ministry has no spare manpower during Lantern Rite.
:'''Weijin:''' If you don't mind, could you help me look at the requests that I recorded on my pad? If you could help me settle some of these commissions, that would be better still...
:{{DIcon}} Let me see...
::'''Weijin:''' Wonderful! Thank you for your help. Please, have a look at these commissions.
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things going on right now...
::'''Weijin:''' That's fine. If you're willing, you can swing by later as well. I'll be here manning the counter in the meantime.
