'''Medicine in Teyvat''' appears to be primarily rudimentary, with an emphasis on herbal concoctions using plants and other elements that can be readily found in the wild and supplemented by some basic medical procedures and devices. Elemental powers are also used in healing.

==Medicine==
===Elemental Powers===
Although far from exclusive to it, {{Hydro}} is an element often paired with [[Healing]] abilities. [[Barbara]] is canonically a well-known healer in Mondstadt due to her Hydro healing powers,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Barbara}}</ref> and notably, the only enemies able to heal their allies are the [[Fatui Skirmisher - Hydrogunner Legionnaire]], [[Hydro Samachurl]] and [[Hydro Specter]]. {{Anemo}} has also been associated with healing, as [[Jean]] also has canonically used her Anemo powers to heal.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Master's Day Off (Quest)}}</ref>

Manipulation of the quantity of elemental energy within [[Abbas|a person]]'s body has been used to control the symptoms of [[Eleazar]]; however, this was an experimental treatment and is not widespread practice.<ref name="EleazarHospital">{{Ref/HEO|Eleazar Hospital Notes}}</ref>

===Non-Herbal Treatments===
Adhesive bandages are used to cover up small wounds<ref>{{Ref/CS|Bennett}}</ref> and dislocations appear to be regularly treated with reduction maneuvers. The use of syringes for injected medications has also been referenced.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tahmina|Dialogue}}</ref>

There is some recognition of dementia as well as understanding of its cause being due to changes in neuronal function. While treatment for this condition is referenced, it is unclear what exactly said treatment entails.<ref>{{Ref/Location|Bimarstan|Other Interactable Objects}}</ref>

Therapy <!--despite all prior indications that it did not exist-->is recognized as a means of treating mental disorders such as Loneliness Syndrome.
* [[Jalacan]] uses "Guidance Therapy" to help treat the disorder in [[Zuria Destree]]; this appears to involve walking the patient through their delusions to an acceptable end point in order to allow the patient to process the event responsible for inciting symptoms of the syndrome.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Miraculous Crown}}</ref>

Medication additionally exists for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. A medication labelled "Solamenaline" appears to be used in the treatment of Loneliness Syndrome;<ref>Event [[Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures]] Interactable: [[Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures/Story#Solamenaline|Solamenaline]]</ref> however, its components are not known.

==Procedures==
===Autopsy===
Teyvat appears to have at least fundamental understandings of the concept of autopsy, including rudimentary toxicological studies. It is unclear whether microscopic findings are part of the autopsy process.
* [[Long-Sealed Mystery]] contains reference to an autopsy conducted on [[Takatsukasa Isamu]] in the attempt to determine the cause of his demise.
** A toxicological study is performed during this investigation to determine that the powder found within Isamu's stomach is a novel poison.
* [[Zandik's Legacy]] contains references to [[Sohreh]]'s autopsy and indicates that there is an understanding of the implication of a broken {{w|hyoid bone}}.
** The Ragged Records also indicate that there is knowledge of the presentation of organ failure.

===Neurostimulation===
There is a basic understanding that neurostimulation can have an impact on an individual's mental stability or mood, but it is unclear if this is used in practice in modern Teyvat or if it remains purely theoretical.<ref name="EleazarHospital" />

===Surgery===
Surgery is practiced in Teyvat. [[Yinxing]] performs amputations as needed for the crew of the Crux Fleet.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life on the High Seas}}</ref> [[Zandik]] was able to attach a new, fully functional arm to Abbas in an attempt to treat the symptoms of Eleazar.<ref name="EleazarHospital" />

==Trivia==
* Lilac Daphne has a real-world equivalent as one of the 50 fundamental herbs of {{w|Chinese herbology}}. It is said to have an anticonvulsant, analgesic, diuretic, antitussive, expectorant, and mild sedative effect.<ref>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine: [https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2684108 Wound Healing and the Use of Medicinal Plants] (4.18. ''Daphne genkwa'')</ref>

* Vasanti Grass appears to derive its name from a Hindi word meaning "of or pertaining to spring". The word is also used to refer to several species of plants in Sanskrit.<ref>[https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/vasanti Vasanti]</ref>

* The Chinese term for {{Lang|'''Solamenaline'''|zh=百愁解|zh_rm=bǎi chóu jiě}} appears to reference the Chinese term for {{Lang|'''Prozac'''|zh=百忧解|zh_rm=bǎi yōu jiě}},<ref>[https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E6%B0%9F%E8%A5%BF%E6%B1%80 百忧解]</ref> which is a real-world anti-depressant medication. The English term may derive from the Latin sōlāmen, meaning consolation.<ref>{{wt|Solamen}}</ref>
