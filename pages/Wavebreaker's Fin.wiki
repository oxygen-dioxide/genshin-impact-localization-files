==Description==
The naginata of "[[Umigozen]]," the mighty warrior of [[Watatsumi Island|Watatsumi]]. Its edge flows with the phosphorescence of the depths.<br>
The way this person once made the navies of [[Narukami Island|Narukami]] quail are well-recorded in the island's music.

The whalesong that the twin Watatsumi shrine maidens once sang followed the tide's flow into the dreams of the island's people.<br>
All of Watatsumi's warriors pinned their hopes and will to fight upon their shoulders.<br>
And they brandished their nagamaki like a white, flowing wave, and with a loud shout advanced upon the other islands.<br>
Yet the glory of [[Orobashi|Omikami]] and that of his warriors were dimmed by the lightning's glow...<br>
[[Mouun]] was consumed by a dark storm of crow feathers, and the great whale who sang with the sisters sank to the bottom of the sea.<br>
The [[Akuou|vassal ruler]], determined as a child, the vanguard of their forces, vanished into a rift rent into the very earth itself.

"Umigozen" was lost to the waves, becoming a myth to the archipelago at large.<br>
Some say that she dove alone into the press of tengu warriors to reclaim the bodies of her comrades, and was lost after a valiant last stand.<br>
Others say that she hid thenceforth, steering her flagship into the Dark Sea at the borders of the world...<br>
The only proof that she once sought to change the tides of the world is this still-sharp naginata.

As long as the seas are yet disturbed by the waves, so too might the memory of her song live on.<br>
Legend even has it that the song yet echoes within seashells and the bellies of mighty whales at the bottom of the sea.
