{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with the Book of Revealing)
:'''Book of Revealing:''' (The content on the pages still consists of incomprehensible symbols, letters, ancient languages, and geometric figures. But a period of focus seems to gradually render their meaning comprehensible.)
:'''Paimon:''' Canotila doesn't seem to be here. Maybe she's in that mysterious place again! Should we start meditating?
:{{DIcon}} Having heard what she said the last time...
::{{DIcon}} I'm a little bit concerned. I'm going to check it out.
:'''Paimon:''' Well... This is kinda unsettling, but let's go together!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, why don't you wait out here for me?
:'''Paimon:''' What?
:{{DIcon}} The world in the Book of Revealing...
::{{DIcon}} It may be more dangerous than we imagined.
:::{{DIcon}} So I don't want you to take the risk.
::{{DIcon}} Maybe there's a side of it that we don't know about.
:::{{DIcon}} So I don't want you to take the risk.
:'''Paimon:''' But... we've been journeying together this whole time, haven't we? There's no hardship we can't overcome, and no enemies we can't defeat together.
:{{DIcon}} The dangers inside may not be something force alone can resolve.
:'''Paimon:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, if you insist! You're smarter than Paimon, so Paimon has faith in you. Just don't abandon Paimon! Paimon will wait right here until you return!
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I promise. I'll be right back.
::'''Book of Revealing:''' (The edges of the pages blur gradually. A profoundly unfamiliar yet familiar world enters your field of vision. Here...)
:;(Enter [[??? (Fontaine)|???]])
:{{DIcon}} Let me get ready first...
::'''Paimon:''' Sure!

;(Interact with the Book of Revealing, if "let me prepare" was chosen)
:'''Book of Revealing:''' (The content on the pages still consists of incomprehensible symbols, letters, ancient languages, and geometric figures. But a period of focus seems to gradually render their meaning comprehensible.)
:'''Paimon:''' Are you going to meditate now? Do be careful!
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Yes.
::'''Book of Revealing:''' (The edges of the pages blur gradually. A profoundly unfamiliar yet familiar world enters your field of vision. Here...)
:{{DIcon}} Not right now.
::'''Book of Revealing:''' ...

;(Enter ???)
:'''Traveler:''' (This isn't where I got to through Meditation before. Over there... That's...)

;(Interact with the Fallen Bouquet)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fallen Bouquet}}

;(Talk to Caterpillar through the barrier, optional)
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Caterpillar.
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Looks like he can't hear me.)

;(Talk to Caterpillar)
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Caterpillar.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Who's there?
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...It's you. I remember you.
:{{DIcon}} What brings you here?
:'''Caterpillar:''' I was just going to ask you the same thing.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Nothing, it's just that...
:'''Caterpillar:''' You're {{Traveler}}, right? And... where is the little white thing that's always with you? What was her name again? Why isn't she here?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon is waiting for me outside.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Was that her name? Anyway, it doesn't matter. You're a good person, and so is Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
:'''Caterpillar:''' I came here to look for something important. Do you know what it is I'm looking for?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Hmm, never mind. Forget that I asked. Why are you here, anyway? This place is very dangerous... You should turn around now. There were people who once came here for the trial, but they lost their way, and their minds turned to mush.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Huh. I remember now. You and I... We accomplished something incredible together. The only thing in my life that I'm proud of...
:{{DIcon}} You mean...
::{{DIcon}} Defeating Narzissenkreuz?
:::'''Caterpillar:''' What happened to him? Are you a member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo? Or... Are you one of Guillotin's people?
::{{DIcon}} Rescuing Lanoire?
:::'''Caterpillar:''' I remember now. Yes, we escaped from the prison under the sea with her &mdash; a good thing, too. That was no place for children. She should be living under the sun, amongst the flowers.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Ah, The golden butterfly. As shiny as the sun itself...
:'''Caterpillar:''' Once you have a light like that, everything will... Everything...

;(Talk to Caterpillar)
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...Is that so? That makes things easier, then. What's your name?
:{{DIcon}} Caterpillar.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I didn't think I'd see you here, {{Traveler}}. Where's Paimon, though? I don't see her.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Wait, you're not some monster who's transformed into someone I know in order to trick me, are you?
:{{DIcon}} We just saw each other not long ago.
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...Is that so? It feels like a long time has passed since we said farewell. Might just be my age, though, and my memory getting worse as I get older.
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...Are you sure you are not a monster?
:{{DIcon}} Do you still remember?
::{{DIcon}} The giant's garden.
::{{DIcon}} The apprentice and the little fish.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I remember, yes. Ah. It's really you.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Sorry, I've encountered too many incredible things here, and many battles that could not be won.
:'''Caterpillar:''' But things have finally changed here. Golden rays of light have arisen, and the sunflowers have bloomed. Even the universe the ancient ones speculated about is not immune to changes.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Maybe things will get better. Maybe I will finally understand, and be able to let go.
:{{DIcon}} Caterpillar...
::{{DIcon}} Come with me.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Haha, I suppose it really is you. I remember now... I knew you, and you haven't changed. You're always sticking your nose in someone else's business, but that's because you're kind and honest.
:'''Caterpillar:''' But you don't have to worry about me. I don't need help &mdash; you've seen what I'm capable of.
:'''Caterpillar:''' And... Perhaps I know more about this place than even you do.
:'''Puppy:''' Hilichurl, tell the {{MC|m=boy|f=girl}} to leave at once.
:{{DIcon}} Do you have something to tell me?
:'''Puppy:''' ...Can you understand what I'm saying? I see. Let me ask you... What am I in your eyes?
:{{DIcon}} A dog.
:'''Puppy:''' Hmm. Maybe there is still hope.
:'''Puppy:''' Leave this place, young one. It's for your own good.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I agree, {{Traveler}}. You belong to a brighter world.
:{{DIcon}} I have a question...
:'''Puppy:''' You shouldn't. Goodbye, and don't come back.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I won't just leave like this. Your real name is...
<!-- Transition back to Canotila and the Book of Revealing -->
:;(The Traveler is sent back to [[Canotila and the Book of Revealing]])
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! You're back!
:{{DIcon}} How long was I gone for?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, just the blink of an eye.
:{{DIcon}} If it was just a blink of an eye to you...
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong?
:{{DIcon}} Nothing. I suppose it really is dangerous inside.
:'''Paimon:''' Is that so...
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, where's Canotila? She didn't go become a guard in the Court of Fontaine, did she?
:{{DIcon}} ...I'm feeling a little dizzy, let's come back next time.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, okay. Should we find something to eat? Paimon was so worried about you that she's now starving!
:{{DIcon}} Wasn't it just a blink of an eye for you?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, it took a lot of effort to worry about you!
