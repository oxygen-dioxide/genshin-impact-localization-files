==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Baizhu wears a high-collared, short-sleeved, cropped shirt that is teal and purple and fastens with buttons across the front. His lavender-and-blue pants have crossing white patterns resembling snake skin. Over his pants, he wears a green sash from which his {{Dendro}} [[Vision]] hangs attached to a tassel, and a pale blue jacket patterned with a white snake and green flowers, similar to a lab coat, drapes around his shoulders like a cape. From his sash, several colorful pieces of fabric hang on his right, while a long green-and-white adornment hangs on his let. At the back of his waist is a cylindrical green-and-gold container, tied with a bow made of green cord. He wears asymmetrical arm gauntlets with gold details, a white one on his right and a black one on his left. The left arm also bears a white beaded bracelet and a loosely wound bandage. A golden coin on a purple cord sits around his right ankle, and his flats are dark blue, with gold details and purple soles. [[Changsheng]] drapes around his neck like a scarf.
