|description    = A claw-snapping crab that can be found in various water bodies throughout [[Teyvat]].<br>This golden-shelled crab is especially tasty, and is the star of the show in the famed Liyue dish known as Golden Crab.<br>Some people call those who run amok as they please "crabs," but a crab's manner of movement is not so much a matter of their character as it is their physical makeup. Such monikers are most unfair to crab-kind.<br>Because of the moisture in the caves and soil, these crabs can live comfortably even if they are far away from rivers or beaches.
