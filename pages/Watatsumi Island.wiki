==Lore== 
'''Watatsumi Island''' got its name from the phrase "the god of the oceans" from Watatsumi's ancient language.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Coral Branch of a Distant Sea}}</ref> It was created by [[Orobashi]] after the Archon War.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref> The giant corals found at the island were coral branches that were broken off from Orobashi's body. These corals were later used as a ladder by the people of [[Enkanomiya]] to rise to the surface.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Jade Branch of a Distant Sea}}</ref> The people of Enkanomiya became the ancestors of the people of Watatsumi.  Under the leadership of the [[Sangonomiya Clan]], they worship the {{Lang|[[Watatsumi Omikami]]|ja=海祇大御神}} instead of the Raiden Shogun.<ref name="travel highlight">Official Genshin Impact Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/town/inazuma?noteId=16718 Inazuma Travel Highlights: Kujou Encampment]</ref>

The [[Sangonomiya Shrine]] is located at the center of this island, surrounded by a canopy of mountains and waterfalls. The distance from the capital city has allowed the residents of this island to develop its own unique culture and customs, and as such, many Inazumans outside of this island are well aware of the poor relationship they have with the Shogun and her government &mdash; there was a brutal war between the two long ago, but eventually ended with the [[Sangonomiya Clan]] pursuing peace.

As a result, the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] has driven hostility between the Sangonomiya Clan and the followers of the Raiden Shogun, particularly the [[Tenryou Commission]], to an all-time high, and the [[Watatsumi Army]] has risen up in opposition to the decree.<ref name="travel highlight" /> Following the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, negotiations are underway to reconnect Watatsumi with the rest of Inazuma under the Shogunate's rule.

===Holy Soil===
According to legends, the depths of Enkanomiya attempts to absorb the spirit of Watatsumi Island, which causes the soil to bleach and erode, and, if left unchecked, will turn the island into a desert. To prevent this, a ritual called the [[Watatsumi Mitama Omatsuri]] is conducted regularly. A [[Bloodbranch Coral|Jade Coral Branch]] from Enkanomiya is required to conduct the ritual. After the events of the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]], [[Kokomi]] decides to find a new way to counteract the Holy Soil phenomenon as to no longer disturb the vishaps.

===Prophecy===
There is an old Enkanomiya prophecy that foretells the rebirth of the [[Dragon of Water]] in human form.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* In Japanese mythology, {{Lang|{{w|Watatsumi}}|ja={{Rubi|海神|わたつみ}}}}, or sometimes Wadatsumi, is the name of the tutelary deity (''kami'') of the sea, often equated with the dragon god {{w|Ryūjin|Ryuujin}}. In some cases, the term may be used to refer to the sea itself.
*Sangonomiya Shrine may be inspired by {{W|Ryūgū-jō|Ryuuguu-jou}}, the undersea palace of Ryuujin in Japanese folklore. One of the other names of Ryuuguu is {{Lang|"Watatsumi Palace"|ja={{Rubi|海|わたつみ|宮|のみや}}|ja_rm=Watatsumi no Miya}}.<ref>Japanese Wikipedia: [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BE%8D%E5%AE%AE Ryūgū]</ref>
