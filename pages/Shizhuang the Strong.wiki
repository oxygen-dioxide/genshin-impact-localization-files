:'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' I head up the mining operation around these parts. What's your business here?
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Shizhuang the Strong knows; Version 1)
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Ever since they closed the Chasm, I've been patrolling this area. Mostly to stop people breaking the rules and trying to get inside...
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' I've noticed some sizable Crystal Ore deposits while on patrol. Shame they're no use to me, they aren't the ores I'm looking for.
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' You're interested? Alright, I think they were...
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Here. Marked on your map. Feel free to explore, just keep away from the Chasm.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)

:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Ever since they closed the Chasm, I've been patrolling this area. Mostly to stop people breaking the rules and trying to get inside...
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' I've heard that these Crystal Ores were formed under the influence of Ley Line energies. They are very hard to come by, and very few smiths know how to work them.
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' While on duty, I've noticed quite a lot of Magical Ore around. Granted, it's much rarer than the regular kind, but still... you'd have thought at least one of the blacksmiths might know how to process it...
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' You're interested? Alright, I think they were...
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Here. Marked on your map. Feel free to explore, just keep away from the Chasm.

:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Shizhuang the Strong knows)
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Nothing much, just a few pig-headed miners trying to get into the Chasm. I managed to stop them.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Chasm.
::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Mining in the Chasm is prohibited now. The Qixing came and sealed the whole place off.
::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Before that, it was the biggest mine in Liyue in terms of output. Finest ore you'll find anywhere, and it's chock-full of jade stones too.
::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Under pressure from our buyers to meet demand, I had the boys working round the clock at this place. Until one day, they dug up... something very strange...
::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' In an effort to contain it, the Qixing insisted on sealing the place off, despite it going against their immediate interests...
::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Now that did surprise me. It's not like those big business types to look past the Mora signs in their eyes.
::{{DIcon}} Something very strange?
::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' ...I didn't see it with my own eyes. But I'm told the ones who did have been in a coma ever since.
::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Whatever it is... maybe it's the source of all the rare ore deposits around here.
:;(Before completing ???)
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' If even the Qixing's response is to literally put a lid on it, then I certainly don't plan to look into it any further myself.
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' It will serve me better to concentrate on my next step now the mine's closed. I can't go letting my curiosity get the better of me.
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' I feel sorry for the boys though. Now the mine's gone, they're lost souls. They've got nothing to do with themselves, and it's really crushed them.
:;(After completing ???)
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Now I've actually heard that a small portion of The Chasm has been reopened, and that some of our comrades have returned to work. But I'm not too sure about the details...
:::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' But there's no point thinking about all this either way. It's better to be patient and wait for further news.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Shizhuang the Strong:''' Alright then. Make sure you stay away from the out-of-bounds area.
