==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nima:''' {{Not a Typo|[[Aranara|Raranana]]}}, {{Not a Typo|Raranana}}, when will you come see me!
:{{DIcon}} What are you singing?
::'''Nima:''' It's a song I wrote myself!
::'''Nima:''' Maybe {{Not a Typo|Raranana}} would visit me again if they heard the song.
::{{DIcon}} Who's {{Not a Typo|Raranana}}?
::'''Nima:''' Small, round friends.
::'''Nima:''' {{Not a Typo|Raranana}} would appear when the adults aren't around, just like me slacking off farming work.
::'''Nima:''' But [[Minoo]] always made fun of me all the time for believing in {{Not a Typo|Raranana}}, and got mad at me for saying the name wrong.
::'''Nima:''' I've seen {{Not a Typo|Raranana}} with my own eyes, though... They're the weedfolk, so {{Not a Typo|Raranana}} does exist for sure.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Nima:''' {{Not a Typo|Raranana}}, {{Not a Typo|Raranana}}, when will I see you again!
