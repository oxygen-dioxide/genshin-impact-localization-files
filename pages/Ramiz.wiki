===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ramiz:''' Grandma, may I ask you a question? [[Nawaz]] and I have been thinking about this one, but we still don't get it.
:'''Kulsoom:''' Oh, of course you can, dear.
:'''Ramiz:''' So, uh... Grandma, is [[King Deshret]] really gonna come back from the dead...?
:'''Kulsoom:''' ...!
:'''Ramiz:''' Grandma?
:'''Kulsoom:''' Those fanatic believers! Can't they spare the children!?
:'''Kulsoom:''' Child, please, listen well. Though gods are indeed very powerful, even they can disappear.
:'''Kulsoom:''' Being obsessed with things that have disappeared is madness. It is no way to live.
:'''Kulsoom:''' *sigh* If only the desert children had the chance to learn a little more. Then they wouldn't easily fall for such lies...
:'''Kulsoom:''' Child, I... I know this is a lot to ask, but please, study hard &mdash; you should learn a thing or two from [[Setaria]].
:'''Ramiz:''' I... I understand.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ramiz:''' Did you know that the rainforest is actually home to [[Shroomboar|pigs that have mushrooms growing on them]] and [[Aranara|fairies that have leaves on their heads]]?
:{{DIcon}} I might have heard a thing or two.
::'''Ramiz:''' Ooh! That means you must've read the "Aranara" picture book series too, right?
::'''Ramiz:''' Setaria brought me lots and lots of those books so that I can read them and learn words at the same time.
::'''Ramiz:''' I thought that I might have trouble understanding them, but turns out that this stuff is super interesting!
::'''Ramiz:''' I just, uh... Sometimes, I get too excited to see the ending and read too fast, so I end up forgetting to record some words that I don't know yet...
::'''Ramiz:''' I'll ask Setaria the next time I see her, though!
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about Setaria...
::'''Ramiz:''' Setaria's been hanging around the village a lot these days, but she always looks super busy and hasn't been able to read with me much.
::'''Ramiz:''' I get it, though! She's here to do some really important work, I'm sure of that! Granny says that the thing she's working on will make life in the village better!
::'''Ramiz:''' I wanna learn loads of stuff too so I can help her!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ramiz:''' Bye!
