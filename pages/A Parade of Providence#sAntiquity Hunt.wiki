|text1  = Follow the {{Color|help|Archaeological Manual}} to reach Archaeological Zones in which the replica relics are buried.
|image2 = Tutorial A Parade of Providence Antiquity Hunt 2.png
|text2  = Once you are in an Archaeological Zone, equip and use the {{Color|help|Search Compass}}.<br>The Compass will take the closest replica relic's location as its target, and use Trail Density to show how far you presently are from that location. {{Color|help|The closer you are to the burial location, the denser the trail will be}}.
|image3 = Tutorial A Parade of Providence Antiquity Hunt 3.png
|text3  = You can place Search Compasses in different locations, which will allow you to use their indicated Trail Densities to search in the {{Color|help|direction of higher Trail Density}}. After the Trail Density reaches 90%, you can immediately detect the replica relic.<br>You can have a total of {{Color|help|3}} Search Compasses deployed at once.
|image4 = Tutorial A Parade of Providence Antiquity Hunt 4.png
|text4  = Archaeological Zones can contain elemental objects that will {{Color|help|disrupt}} the detection abilities of the Search Compasses. If you find such items, {{Color|help|clear them out}} quickly and restart your search.
|image5 = Tutorial A Parade of Providence Antiquity Hunt 5.png
|text5  = After you have deployed Search Compasses in an Archaeological Zone for a time, the Compasses will be able to more accurately determine the position of the replica relics, and will {{Color|help|cause a more accurate search area}} to be displayed on your map.
