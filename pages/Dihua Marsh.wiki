==Descriptions==
{{Description|This is where the sifting of the wavy silvergrass and the croaking of frogs join in song, and it is also the final resting place of many a martial nomad.|Viewpoint, [[Marsh of Rustling Reeds]]}}
{{Description|An alluvial plain shaped by the flow of [[Bishui River]].<br />The waterfall to its northwest is famous among travelers.<br />Aquatic plants and natural resources abound in this fertile land near Mt. Qingce.|[[Expedition]] description}}
{{Description|Dihua Marsh, a wetland area north of Liyue, gets its name from the silvergrass ("dihua" in the local language) that grows in the shallows of the marsh.<br />The scrambling web of rivers has grown into a flourishing and wide-spread ecosystem full of flora and fauna — an awe-inspiring sight for travelers to the area.<br />The area also acts as the road from Mondstadt to Liyue, and as such many merchant caravans choose to stop here to rest. Wangshu Inn stands within the area, a symbolic structure from all directions.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}

==Trivia==
* "Dihua" refers to Amur silvergrass, a grass native to cool-temperate regions in northeast Asia. It is not to be confused for its lookalike &mdash; {{w|Miscanthus sinensis|Chinese silver grass}}.
* The design of the Dihua Marsh area took many elements from {{w|Guilin| Guilin}} culture, landscape, and architecture.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/oPeoiFHKnYI "Travels Afar" Scenic Spot Collaboration Documentary - Guilin Chapter]</ref>
