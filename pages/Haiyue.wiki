{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Haiyue:''' Isn't this place great? The weather can get a bit humid sometimes, but otherwise, it's perfect.
:{{DIcon}} Here for a vacation, then?
::'''Haiyue:''' To be precise, I'm here for work, but I've already done everything I need to do.
::'''Haiyue:''' I may be a sailor who roams the world, ever ready to embrace new adventures, but there are still a few places I regard more fondly than most.
::'''Haiyue:''' This place is probably my second favorite place in the world after my home. Life here goes on at a relaxed pace, and the people are also carefree and friendly.
::'''Haiyue:''' I got myself a membership card at the Golden Dusk after my first time here. Now, I help out the owner with some goods and repairs whenever I can. Also helps that she'll always give some discounts.
:{{DIcon}} I suppose.
::'''Haiyue:''' Haha, let's enjoy the sea breeze together!
