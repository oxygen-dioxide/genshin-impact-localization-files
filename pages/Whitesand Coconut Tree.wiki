|description    = A tall tree that grows in warm, moist climates and produces a fruit with a hard outer shell and sweet meat inside. Chefs often use this fruit to make drinks.<br />The "[[Seven Mountain Treatises]]" records that the whiter the sand nearby, the better the quality of the coconuts that grow on the tree. For this reason, "Whitesand" is a term for coconut trees of the highest grade.
