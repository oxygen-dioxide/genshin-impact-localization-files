'''Artifact Strongboxes''' can be created through [[Mystic Offering]]s, which can be accessed from a [[Crafting Bench]]. Mystic Offering is unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 45.

Every three 5-Star [[Artifacts]] sacrificed will create one Artifact Strongbox, which contains a random Artifact from the selected set. A total of 39 Artifacts can be sacrificed at once.
