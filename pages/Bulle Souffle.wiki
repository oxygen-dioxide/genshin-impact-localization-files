|description     = A very small cake nestled within a Bulle Fruit skin.
|desc_suspicious = You could not resist sneaking a peek as this baked, only to see the expanding souffle collapse speedily... It seems that curiosity not only kills cats, but ruins cakes too.
|desc_basic      = Pour the beaten egg whites into a Bulle Fruit skin that has been scraped empty, and bake it until the souffle has evenly expanded. The word "Bulle" isn't a part of the name just because it's in the ingredient list, but because the finished product allows the tongue to delight in bubble-like spongy softness.
|desc_delicious  = It all starts with that glorious, fluffy mouthfeel. Then comes the rich eggy aroma and fruity-fresh flavor suffusing your mouth, as if you had plunged headfirst into pillowy clouds, such that the very air sings with subtle sweetness.
