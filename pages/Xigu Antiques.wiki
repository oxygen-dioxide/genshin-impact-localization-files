{{Lang|'''Xigu Antiques'''|zh=希古居|zh_rm=Xīgǔ-jū}} is an antiques [[shop]] found in [[Liyue Harbor]]. The shop is tended by [[Linlang]] between 22:30 and 06:00, and offers 2-star versions of all five artifacts from the [[Traveling Doctor]] [[Artifact Set|artifact set]] for sale.

The stock is replenished every 7 days.

There are certain quest items Linlang will buy from the player in exchange for Mora. These items are one time only sales, and the items cannot be purchased back from the shop. These items include:
* The three [[Nameless Treasure]]s from the Hidden Exploration Objective [[Hidden in Nameless Treasures]], for 350 Adventure EXP, 40 Primogems and 100,000 Mora
* The [[Dull Ring]] from the [[Nine Pillars of Peace]] quest, for 200,000 Mora
* The [[Dragonbone Orb]] from the Hidden Exploration Objective [[Selling the Dragonbone Orb]], for 80,000 Mora and 5 [[Bountiful Year]]s

==Trivia==
* Xigu Antiques is the setting of the [[Rex Incognito]] series, where its first owner, Min'gui, tries to pass off a counterfeit item as a genuine article to a disguised [[Rex Lapis]].
** The Rex Incognito series is labeled as a fantasy novel, so whether these events actually happened are dubious.
* Xigu Antiques is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Fine Brushwork: Bowl of Blossoms]]."
