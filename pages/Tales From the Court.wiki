{{Quest Description|Isadora from the Court of Fontaine seems to have encountered some trouble...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Isadora)
:'''Isadora:''' Huh. Where'd it go? What bad luck...
:'''Isadora:''' Ugh. I won't be able to write another copy either...
:{{DIcon}} Did you lose something?
:'''Isadora:''' Well, I do hope that it was *only* lost &mdash; I do consider myself an optimist, after all.
:{{DIcon}} Is that what you call optimism?
:{{DIcon}} Is losing things a good thing?
:'''Isadora:''' Well... It might be when the thing you're looking for is the office semiannual expense ledger.
:'''Isadora:''' This needed to go to Ms. [[Keiser]] sometime soon... But I suddenly discovered that the ledger was missing five pages.
:'''Isadora:''' These five pages are from five separate months and contain a great number of expenses.
:'''Isadora:''' It was only in the final review that I noticed they were gone.
:'''Isadora:''' If I had not accidentally misplaced them and instead never done them at all... then how did this final amount for our official expenses come about?
:'''Isadora:''' Ugh, I daren't think about it. If I really did forget to write them, Ms. [[Cadme]] will almost certainly force me to dig up the ledgers from the last decade and make me check them again.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds pretty serious...
:'''Isadora:''' That's because it is! If the documents were not written or were lost, that means quite a few offices will have funding issues next month.
:'''Isadora:''' What rotten luck... I only remember pulling an all-nighter writing the ledger and bringing it to the Palais today.
:'''Isadora:''' When I reached this spot, I was startled by a large flock of seagulls, and my hands loosened for a moment.
:'''Isadora:''' *sigh* I might really have lost the documents during that time...
:{{DIcon}} I'll help you search.
:{{DIcon}} Let's search together.
:'''Isadora:''' You'd be willing to help? Wonderful! Come, let's follow this road first, then.
:'''Isadora:''' The data involved is not top secret or anything, so don't worry about accidentally seeing something when picking the sheets up.
:'''Isadora:''' Ah, yes, I also met Officer [[Muirne]] at that time! She even chased the seagulls away for me.
:'''Isadora:''' We can ask her if she saw the ledger.

;(Talk to Muirne)
:'''Muirne:''' Ms. Isadora, is there something I can help you with?
:'''Isadora:''' Officer Muirne, I have a question for you. Do you remember the stack of accounts I brought to the office this morning?
:'''Muirne:''' I remember that. You were attacked by a flock of [[Violetgold Angler Gull]]s as well, right?
:'''Isadora:''' Yes, that's right! Once those annoying gulls flew away, I hurried over to my office.
:'''Isadora:''' Do you recall if I left any sheets on the ground when I ran off?
:'''Muirne:''' Um... I can't remember. I was also busy with other work at the time...
:'''Muirne:''' But if you need them urgently, we can "reenact" your path to the office.
:'''Isadora:''' Eh? Could you, really? I... don't want to ask too much of you.
:'''Muirne:''' We're just looking for things &mdash; a much easier task than work at the [[Palais Mermonia]], that's for sure.
:'''Muirne:''' I do recall that you had tied the documents you were carrying together into stacks. Is that correct?
:'''Isadora:''' That's right. We need to be quite precise with our reports for cost review, after all. You've got a good eye, huh?
:'''Isadora:''' Everything has to be listed, from large tasks like getting artisans to maintain the outer walls of the Palais, to small ones like changing a lock on a desk.
:'''Isadora:''' That's how every month's expenses come up to a thick bundle that needs rope to tie together.
:'''Muirne:''' In short, there's no way that a single sheet might have just flown off by itself &mdash; even though you had lost documents, you would have lost them stack by stack.
:'''Muirne:''' It hasn't been long since you got to the office, so let's set off now.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Isadora:''' This is where I was attacked by those gulls! Those things are bad luck, I swear &mdash; I have no idea why they decided to swoop down at me!
:'''Isadora:''' I could only flee while clutching the documents. Thank goodness you were on hand to chase them off, Officer Muirne!
:'''Muirne:''' But it doesn't look like there are any documents here... Let's keep going.

;(While following Muirne)
:'''Muirne:''' Nothing here either... and there are police patrolling this area, too.
:'''Muirne:''' If they discovered the documents, they would've reported them to the Palais right away.
:'''Muirne:''' Let's keep walking.

;(Follow Muirne to [[Café Lutece]])
:'''Isadora:''' This... is the cafe where I burned the midnight oil settling the ledgers...
:'''Arouet:''' That you, Ms. Isadora? Thank goodness, I've finally found you. Are these the documents you left behind?
:'''Isadora:''' Eh!? Th&mdash;This...

;(Approach Arouet with Muirne)
:'''Isadora:''' Ah, these are the documents I need! Oh, thank the Archon, they're all here!
:{{DIcon}} Why were you doing accounts at the cafe?
:'''Isadora:''' W&mdash;Well, I need lots of coffee to make sure I'm counting it all right.
:'''Isadora:''' This is the expenses of all the offices within the Palais, mind you &mdash; counting it up's supposed to be five people's work.
:'''Isadora:''' But apart from me, everyone in the office is often being borrowed by some other office, sent out on work, or is busy with some visitation...
:'''Isadora:''' So when it came time to count expenses, it was just me doing it &mdash; I haven't slept in days!
:'''Isadora:''' Not only did the expenses need counting up, but even the settling of the bills got left to me. My vision's practically swimming over here...
:'''Muirne:''' Regardless, it's good that we found those accounts. If you'll allow me, Ms. Isadora, I'll accompany you back to the Palais.
:'''Isadora:''' Thank you, Officer Muirne. *sigh* I swear, you and the Traveler are the only two good souls I've met these last three months.
:'''Isadora:''' Everyone else is either yelling at me or pushing me to work.
:'''Isadora:''' Ugh, no, no, I need to stop complaining. I need to go back, or Ms. Keiser's going to yell at me again...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Livre Version===
{{Quest Description|Livre seems to be fretting over something within the Palais Mermonia...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Livre and Cornelia)
:'''Livre:''' I repeat...
:'''Cornelia:''' Mr. Livre. I understand your request, and I'm willing to assist you to the best of my ability, but... Well, please look at this application...
:'''Cornelia:''' The person in charge here is Mr. [[Clapiers]]. All the materials you previously submitted are his to sort and deal with. Apart from him, none of us can work with them.
:'''Cornelia:''' He's presently out on business. His official stamp is needed before your materials can enter our expenses calculation system.
:'''Livre:''' Yeah, yeah! You know what? I've been here three times already &mdash; are you going to handle my case, or aren't you?
:'''Cornelia:''' Please calm down, Mr. Livre. There are only two people in Mr. Clapiers's office &mdash; the other is Mr. [[Monthois]]...
:'''Cornelia:''' But he's getting on in years and is waiting to retire. In truth, he hasn't done any work in the office for a while now. He doesn't even draw a salary anymore.
:'''Livre:''' Then I'll just go to the office and make the old man stamp my stuff. Archons, I'll stamp them myself if I must!
:'''Cornelia:''' I'm very sorry, but that won't do. First, it contravenes the rules, and second, the key to the stamp is with Mr. Clapiers, and only he can access it.
:'''Cornelia:''' As for me, I have other things to attend to as well... Please believe me when I say that Mr. Clapiers will return and help you settle this matter today.
:'''Livre:''' ...Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Cornelia.
:'''Cornelia:''' And you too, Mr. Livre.
:{{Black Screen|Cornelia leaves in a hurry...}}
:'''Livre:''' Looks like I'll have to go home empty-handed, huh... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} What's happened?
:{{DIcon}} What have you encountered?
:'''Livre:''' Nothing, really. I just wasted my time &mdash; half a day, to be precise.
:'''Livre:''' I've had it up to here with this Clapiers! The [[Palais Mermonia]] ordered a few clockwork meka from us, but they have yet to pay for them!
:'''Livre:''' The first time I came to look for him, he told me that the office was doing an internal end-of-month audit, and could only dispense funds to external parties next month &mdash; as such, my application could not be processed.
:'''Livre:''' The second time I came, he claimed that they were out of stamp pad ink, and their supplier's ink warehouse had caught fire, which meant that they needed to purchase some elsewhere. This in turn meant that my application could not be stamped.
:'''Livre:''' The third time, he claimed that this External Assisting Personnel Registration Form had been updated and needed to be filled out again &mdash; and of course, they were out of forms, and new ones would only come in tomorrow.
:'''Livre:''' I was going to come in today and get one, but now he isn't even in the office. Archons...
:'''Rhemia:''' Hmm? Mr. Livre? Why do you look so upset? Can I help you with anything?
:'''Livre:''' Officer Rhemia! It's so good to see you. This is what happened...
:{{Black Screen|The story comes spilling out of Livre's rambling mouth...}}
:'''Rhemia:''' Ah, Mr. Clapiers... He's not easy to get a hold of, for sure, but he really is on Erinnyes at the moment, and not in the Palais Mermonia.
:'''Rhemia:''' Regardless, however, let's get the form for you first.
:'''Livre:''' Eh? But Clapiers said that there weren't any more forms...
:'''Rhemia:''' I have a way to help solve your problem. As I recall, some stores that have long-term arrangements with the Palais Mermonia have encountered the same issue you have.
:'''Rhemia:''' Their solution is to regularly come to the Palais from time to time to collect forms and documents they might need.
:'''Rhemia:''' This makes completing and submitting forms easier and quicker on the one hand, and keeps them abreast of changes made to said documents on the other... "It pays to be prepared," as they say.
:'''Livre:''' Is... that how all the forms disappeared?
:'''Rhemia:''' And that's why I'd say that these stores must have those extra forms, so let's pay them a visit.
:'''Rhemia:''' Besides, I'm sure they'd be more than willing to help out once they've heard of your futile trips to the Palais.
:'''Rhemia:''' Ah, yes. We'd best get the forms you need, fill them out, then bring them to Mr. Clapiers's office before office hours at the Palais end.
:'''Rhemia:''' Would you be willing to help out, Traveler?
:'''Livre:''' Traveler, please, help me! If I cannot get this done, I fear that another sleepless night awaits!
:{{DIcon}} Alright...
:{{DIcon}} But what do I need to do?
:'''Rhemia:''' You just need to check out these two stores and try to borrow the newest version of the External Assisting Personnel Registration Form.
:'''Rhemia:''' Let me see...
:'''Rhemia:''' Please go to Estelle's smithy and Caron's clock shop.
:'''Rhemia:''' Not long ago, the former helped the Palais repair street lamps, while the latter was involved in adjusting their clock.
:'''Rhemia:''' They often take assignments from the Palais, so they're certain to have a form on them somewhere.
:'''Rhemia:''' We'll be counting on your help regarding those locations, and in the meantime, Livre and I will split up and go to other shops.

;(Talk to Livre or Rhemia again, optional)
:'''Livre:''' I don't know how I can thank you, Officer Rhemia. To be honest, I'd heard that you're still on vacation...
:'''Rhemia:''' Helping the people of Fontaine is my duty as a police officer.
:'''Rhemia:''' Alright, let's head out shortly. Any further delay, and we'll fall afoul of the Palais's punctuality with office hours.

;(Talk to Estelle)
:'''Estelle:''' What a pain... It's only a bit of Mora...
:{{DIcon}} About the External Assisting Personnel Registration Form...
:{{Black Screen|You describe Livre's experiences and desire to borrow the form...}}
:'''Estelle:''' *sigh* Tough luck for Livre... I'm afraid I haven't any extras.
:'''Estelle:''' I brought a staff member from the store to assist me when I was repairing street lights at the Palais Mermonia.
:'''Estelle:''' Now, he was barely any help at all, so I didn't put his name down in the form.
:'''Estelle:''' But when it came time to hand the form in, Clapiers insisted that I put every last name down...
:'''Estelle:''' He even said that there would be "serious, unpredictable consequences" if I did not fill it out truthfully.
:'''Estelle:''' Seriously, it's just one missing name. What serious consequences could that lead to? Preposterous.

;(Talk to Estelle again, optional)
:'''Estelle:''' Seriously, it's just one missing name. What serious consequences could that lead to? Preposterous.

;(Talk to Caron)
:'''Caron:''' So tiring... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} About the External Assisting Personnel Registration Form...
:{{Black Screen|You describe Livre's experiences and desire to borrow the form...}}
:'''Caron:''' This happens pretty often when you're dealing with the Palais Mermonia.
:'''Caron:''' I do have an extra form, so you can pass it to him.
:'''Caron:''' But I wouldn't let him get his hopes up about the Palais's work efficiency.
:'''Caron:''' Even if the form is submitted, it will take some time for the formal allocation of funds. And there's no use pressing them for it either...

;(Talk to Caron again, optional)
:'''Caron:''' When will the allocation be done, seriously...

;(Talk to Livre)
:'''Livre:''' No one has any surplus forms. What are we going to do...
:'''Rhemia:''' Has the Palais Mermonia really been hiring contractors this often lately? Curious...
:{{DIcon}} The form's here.
:{{DIcon}} I got your form right here.
:'''Livre:''' Oh my, oh my! You truly are my savior! If I had worked in vain one more time, I would surely have cast myself into a river!
:'''Rhemia:''' May I ask you to... refrain from any behavior that might affect your personal safety and the city's image?
:'''Rhemia:''' Whatever the case, please fill the form out first. Once you've done so, I'll get Ms. Cornelia to pass this on to Mr. Clapiers.
:'''Rhemia:''' No matter how busy he is, Mr. Clapiers couldn't possibly ignore a form already on his table.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Staelle Version===
{{Quest Description|Staelle seems to be in a spot of trouble...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Staelle and Blathine)
:'''Staelle:''' Please, help me out! I was just thinking about the novel's story, and before I knew it, [[Barea]] was just gone!
:'''Blathine:''' Are you sure you didn't leave it at your seat in the opera house, or left it tied to the restroom door, or something?
:'''Staelle:''' I've already searched all those areas. I've even looked under that seat, but Barea wasn't there.
:'''Staelle:''' Oh, the mere thought of it, that my little Barea would be kidnapped by someone, or perhaps follow someone blindly as if stricken by puppy love...
:'''Blathine:''' Ms. Staelle, I'm quite sure that Barea wouldn't make the same mistake twice like that.
:'''Staelle:''' Ah, but my Barry-boo is still so little... and little children make the same errors many times, and even revel in it, right?
:'''Blathine:''' I'm... quite certain that Barea is not as young as you say.
:{{DIcon}} And who's this Barea, if I might ask?
:{{DIcon}} How may I assist thee?
:'''Blathine:''' Ms. Staelle's dog...
:'''Staelle:''' My family.
:'''Blathine:''' Yep. Her family has gone missing, and she's asking for my help.
:'''Blathine:''' Ms. Staelle, we have already searched this area once. I would wager that Barea has headed off into the wilds.
:'''Staelle:''' Then let us go there too!
:'''Blathine:''' Please, Miss, I ask you to stay in the city. With the dress you wear, you would not be able to catch Barea even if you found it.
:'''Staelle:''' Nonsense! Why, Barea would jump into my arms if it so much as saw me!
:'''Blathine:''' Then I suppose it heard us not when we were calling up and down the theater, yes?
:'''Blathine:''' Well, there you have it. I'm afraid I cannot bring Barea back to Ms. Staelle alone.
:'''Blathine:''' I cannot simply leave my post for long, much less ask another colleague to leave theirs with me.
:'''Blathine:''' But if you're willing, Traveler, could you help us both out?
:{{DIcon}} Well, it wouldn't be a problem, per se...
:{{DIcon}} You police need to deal with this stuff too?
::'''Blathine:''' If the citizens of the Court of Fontaine ask me for help, I have no reason to refuse them.
:'''Blathine:''' Well, that's settled, then. Please come with me to the wilds &mdash; we shall look for Barea together.
:'''Blathine:''' Considering its weight and stamina, it cannot have run too far.
:'''Staelle:''' What!? My Barea is most healthy, thank you!
:'''Blathine:''' I would agree &mdash; if we were talking about its mental health.
:'''Blathine:''' Let us be off &mdash; lest Barea gain a taste for the outdoors and run still further away.
:'''Staelle:''' Hey!

;(Talk to Staelle again, optional)
:'''Staelle:''' Is it that Barea doesn't like my new novel? *sigh* But everyone else thinks it's pretty good...
:'''Staelle:''' Perhaps I should read it a nicer passage...

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Blathine:''' Barea dislikes places that are too lively. The opera house probably disturbed it and inspired its escape.
:'''Blathine:''' It might be hiding in the bushes... Let's head to the patch over there.
:'''Blathine:''' Not here... Hmmm, let's head elsewhere...

;(While following Blathine)
:'''Blathine:''' There's some noise from the bushes over there. Do you hear it?
:'''Blathine:''' Let's go &mdash; remember to tread lightly.

;(Approach the dog)
:'''Blathine:''' Well, there it is &mdash; and looking quite good, too.
:'''Blathine:''' I wonder when Ms. Staelle will realize that dogs have no love for the opera, or for her novels?
:'''Blathine:''' Let us return &mdash; she's probably worried sick.

;(Talk to Staelle)
:'''Staelle:''' Barea! Oh, my baby! Where have you been?
:'''Blathine:''' It simply found a quiet spot to rest for a while. A bit of a vacation, you see.
:'''Staelle:''' Ah, I was so worried! Thank you, Officer Blathine, thank you! You will be in my next novel for sure!
:'''Blathine:''' Thank you for your consideration, but it might be best if you save the ink &mdash; I doubt anyone would be all that interested in the daily life of a police officer.
:'''Staelle:''' Then I'll simply have to dramatize your tale... It will be interesting, I swear!
:'''Blathine:''' That promise of yours is already too much drama for me, I think.
:'''Staelle:''' Ah, the conclusion's got to be inspiring! Let me think &mdash; who shall I assign to be your partner...
