: {{DIcon|Idle}} A few less stairs...

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yougui:''' I wish there were fewer steps... I really want to get them to our customers quickly.
:{{DIcon}} Steps?
::'''Yougui:''' The elevation differences in Yilong Wharf are too great, and the water-powered lift is only used to transport large items. It doesn't run often, either.
::'''Yougui:''' Sometimes we just have to take the stairs when we get a job that needs delivering quickly.
::'''Yougui:''' The paths between the upper and lower wharf are designed to be long and winding. Stops them from being steep, but that's extra work for us.
::'''Yougui:''' I heard that the Communications Office is planning on building several small lifts... That will improve the situation, no doubt about it.
:{{DIcon}} Are delivery timetables too tight?
::'''Yougui:''' But we don't really have a say in this, and neither do our customers.
::'''Yougui:''' Accidents on the job are very common, and we're often delayed by all kinds of things...
::'''Yougui:''' Sometimes we are several days late, and if we were transporting precious ingredients, they'd be spoiled by then.
::'''Yougui:''' We don't like to see it happen either, so we can only deliver as quickly as possible.
::'''Yougui:''' But can you pin the blame on our fellow guards?
::'''Yougui:''' No, you can't! Some jobs require traveling very long distances, across places that may not be safe.
:{{DIcon}} You've got this!
::'''Yougui:''' Right. I'll just suck it up. I can take a few more jobs!
