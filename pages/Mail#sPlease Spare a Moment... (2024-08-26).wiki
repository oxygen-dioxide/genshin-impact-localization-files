|text      = A few days ago, I acquired several pieces of jade at an auction. Compared to other distinguished and exquisite items auctioned that day, these uncarved pieces of jade seem rather plain. However, investment is more about the future, not the present.

Given their natural clarity and potential to become anything, I believe that these jade pieces, which quietly embody people's pure and brilliant expectations, are not best suited to be carefully stored in the [[Jade Chamber]].

It is often said, "Fine items are best matched with the talented, only then can they shine together." Therefore, I hope you will accept them. As they travel with you and age gracefully, I wonder what kind of hue they will eventually display... When that time comes, I would appreciate it if you could spare another moment to share your insights with me over our ongoing game of chess.

Just like today, I will prepare a feast and await your presence with sincere anticipation.
