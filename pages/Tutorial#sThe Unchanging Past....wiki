|text1    = The memories of the Queen of All Oases have followed those oases into the unchanging past, turning into tightly shut flower buds. There may yet be some small, guiding power within them...<br>When touched by someone who has been chosen by the oases, these buds will guide them to a certain spot. There, one may summon the memories of the past and, through them, change the situation in the present.
