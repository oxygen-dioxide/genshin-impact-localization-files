==Trivia==
* The name of this achievement references the Biblical account of the prophet {{w|Jonah}}. The Lord commanded him to preach to the people of Nineveh, but fearing their wickedness, Jonah fled and boarded a ship for Tarshish. When the ship is beset by a great storm, Jonah admits to the crew that he is being punished for his disobedience and tells them to throw him overboard. Reluctantly, the crew complies. Jonah is swallowed by a "great fish" and spends three days inside it before the Lord accepts his repentance and causes him to be vomited up on land.
