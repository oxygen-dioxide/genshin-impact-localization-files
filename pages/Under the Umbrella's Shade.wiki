|description  = The poets have it that spores, like trees, are connected to each other, and that all fungal beings in the world share a single dream. At the end of that dream, the spores would take on the forms of all things, and that all things would return to the beginning &mdash; return to being one &mdash; and that there would never again be boundaries. But the evolution of [[Fungi]] into sentient, locomotive beings was not something that happened in such primordial times. Regardless, this place has become fertile soil for Fungi to thrive.

{{Description|It is said that this was once a natural testing ground for experiments regarding the adaptability and evolutionary capabilities of spores. Whether this is true or not, it is inarguable that this place's [[Ley Lines]] make it a real hotbed of fungal evolution.
Someone must cut this evolutionary pathway off before these [[Fungi]] can continue spreading and begin to endanger the forest and even the world beyond.}}

==Guide==
In order to unlock this domain, the player must activate [[Dendro]] [[Elemental Monument]]s in accordance to the symbols placed beside them, beginning with the monument with a glowing symbol. Once the first monument is activated the next monument's glyph will light up, till they are all lit. The dash above the circle acts as an arrow pointing towards what the next monument will be. If the player does not have a Dendro character, [[Dendrograna]] beside the entrance can be used to unlock the domain.

Facing the domain's entrance, activate the pillars in the following order:
#Lower Right
#Lower Left
#Upper Left (after breaking the stone blocking it with [[Dendro]])
#Upper Right
#Lower Center
