==Lore==
[[File:Location Cuijue Slope - Ruin Floor.png|thumb|The interior of the Cuijue Slope ruins]]
Very little is known about Cuijue Slope outside of what is told in the inscription that starts the [[Nine Pillars of Peace]] World Quest. According to legend, the nine pillars were erected to keep nine human desires at bay: Greed, nostalgia, vision, jealousy, anger, lust, self-aggrandizement, competition, and turmoil. By doing so, the conflicts plaguing the world would be quelled. However, if someone were to break the pillars and enter the temple, war would once again consume the world. The inscription thus implores any who would break the seal to take the treasures within and defend Liyue.<ref group="Note">While the English version says "bring peace to Liyue," a more literal reading of the original Chinese equivalent says "defend Liyue in the eight directions (alternatively, from all sides)."<!--「正读此碑者，可自取室内宝器，镇守璃月八方。」--></ref>

Archaeologically, Cuijue Slope is rather unique from other regions of Liyue. The entrance to the shrine is built in a style seen nowhere else in Liyue's currently released regions, and its door features an insignia seen nowhere else. Little to no information exists on the pillars even in Liyue folklore either; however, close observation on the area where the [[Stone of Remembrance]] is inlaid reveals that it depicts something very similar to a [[yaksha]] mask &mdash; specifically, a squished version of [[Xiao]]'s mask. Stones of Remembrance are obtained by offering [[Geoculi]] to [[Statues of The Seven]] in Liyue, suggesting they are closely linked to [[Morax]] and perhaps even [[Celestia]] itself.

By inlaying a Stone of Remembrance into a pillar, the mask's visage cracks (typically throwing off the one who inlaid the stone as well), then an entire portion of the pillar breaks off to reveal a glowing geometric design underneath. The portion that will be destroyed glows white when viewed with [[Elemental Sight]].

After entering the ruin, the first most notable feature of the ruin are the greenish-blue lights that light up the area. So far, such lighting has not appeared in any other ruin. In the chamber at the bottom of the stairs is a large [[Liyue/Culture#Pan Chang knot|Pan Chang knot]] in the middle, inlaid inside a circle and surrounded by four other Pan Chang knots. Two yaksha statues stand before another doorway which leads to treasure.

==Trivia==
*During Closed Beta Test 3, Cuijue Slope looked different; the pillars were grouped closer together and the valley was not as deep as it is now, nor was there a body of water in the valley. There does not seem to have been any special sky effect upon entering their vicinity.
