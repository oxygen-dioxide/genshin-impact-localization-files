==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Vasmrti may be derived from the two Sanskrit words {{Lang|mini=1|sa=व|sa_rm=va}}, an abbreviation of {{Lang|mini=1|sa=वर्ष|sa_rm=varṣa}} meaning "rainy season," and {{Lang|mini=1|sa=स्मृति|sa_rm=smṛti}} which translates to "that which is remembered."
** According to the {{w|Puranas}}, ''Va'' may also refer to the Vedic deity {{Lang|{{w|Varuna}}|sa=वरुण}}, the god of sea and rain.
