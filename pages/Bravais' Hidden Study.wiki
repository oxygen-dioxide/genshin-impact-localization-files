==Interactables==
===Old Notes #1===
This interactable is found beside a bookshelf in Bravais' Hidden Study.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...I received the biological samples. They were carefully stored in sealed jars.
:...It's difficult to say if it is closer to an animal or plant. But it's clear that it is unlike any other carnivorous plant. It hunts more actively for living food.
:...I tried transferring it to a basin, and it started growing rapidly...
:It seems to eat anything. I cannot determine if this is due to its inherent nature or a result of mutation after the introduction of heterogeneous tissue...
:...Maybe that person would be interested in it. Unfortunately, after going to live in seclusion at [[Dryas Wood]], he has been avoiding the [[Fontaine Research Institute|Institute]]'s researchers, including me.
:...
:...have learned that [[Arkhium]] affects its behavior...
:...Further experimentation is pointless. Feeding should be stopped at once.

===Old Notes #2===
This interactable is found on a shelf next to a ladder and plant in Bravais' Hidden Study.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:Salvation is meaningless if only a few can be saved. Were these words to be spoken by one of noble character, that would be all.
:...when the issues of cost and efficiency cannot be resolved, allowing the few to be saved is the best choice.
:...the underwater shelter is undoubtedly a technical success, but even if we ignore cost issues, it's still a stop-gap measure at best.
:The Arkhium Project has greater potential. But the forging can only realize a fragment of its potential, and that is an experimentally proven fact.
:Another project criticized as being purely ornamental...
:Said ornamental value is an objective fact, but it is useless to science...
:Arkhium is rather ornamental too, but its beauty is worthless if it cannot serve the well-being of Fontaine's people.

===The Research Notes of Master Ruggiero===
This interactable is found on a bookshelf in Bravais' Hidden Study.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...About the [[Golden Troupe]]...
:...Comparative studies have been conducted on the surviving ruins of ancient orders from across the land... While they all had different names, the scripts and images left behind support the conclusion that they share the same origin... Ancient scholars believed that all arcane arts originated from a pre-[[Remuria]]n civilization, an belief that now seems to be much more than mere speculation...

:..."[[Fortuna]]"... appears to be the title of a symphony... Ancient documents record the existence of such great symphonies that were connected to the Fundamental Power... The gods of this previous civilized era seem to have ruled Fontaine using the power of symphonies...
:...The ancient Remurians used music to record everything, and even magic was no exception... But their thinking was so peculiar that it hardly seems human. Even the scholars of the ancient orders, self-proclaimed heirs of the pre-civilizational legacy, were unable to fully comprehend it....

:I collected numerous special conches on my quest to uncover proof of the Grand Symphonies' existence... Although the legends about them vary by area, there is a single point upon which all of them agree &mdash; These conches were tools used by this ancient civilization to convey some kind of information...

:The is a clear gap between the magical spells left behind from various eras, and this really complicates my work... But if I assume that a complete schism occurred among these ancient orders at some point in time, then it might explain what happened...

:[[Petrichor]], a strange name indeed. It seems to mean "golem" in the ancient language... Even though it's just a run-down fishing village now, I sense a mysterious energy lingering there, pulling me toward it...
:...The island is far away from Fontaine's waters, and perhaps that's why it has been left neglected for so long... If I manage to discover the [[Faded Castle|Faded Castle]] of legend there, I might find answers to the many questions that vex me...

:(Bravais's annotation: As the founder of the Consilium Sapientium, [[Ruggiero]] was a true great master in his time. Unfortunately, due to the poor academic environment in Fontaine then, his accomplishments never received fair evaluation. Alas, much like myself...)
