{{Description|An ornamental urn that once belonged to the old aristocrats of Mondstadt. Mournful winds seem to echo within its empty interior.}}
'''Royal Silver Urn''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Noblesse Oblige]].

==Description==
An ornamental urn made of sapphire, bearing the silver insignia of a noble house.<br>It is exquisite and elegant, a testament to the aesthetics of the ancient nobles of Mondstadt.

A noble who once ruled over Mondstadt left it behind.<br>However, the extravagant treasures that once lay inside are now gone.<br>These luxuries were symbols of the noble's stature,<br>as well as the confidence, pride, and prosperity of the people of Mondstadt.

Then, the nobles fell prey to power.<br>They took and they spent without regard to the people.<br>Luxurious accessories became vanity items.
