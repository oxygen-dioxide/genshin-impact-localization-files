|description    = Humanity's best friend!<br>These dogs come from a mixed bloodline, and their multicolored fur has three different hues. They have a powerful physique and are quite intelligent, and thus are often raised as either pets or working dogs.<br>In the Realm Within, these exceptionally active canines are very sensitive to the smell of exotic foods, and no edible plants, not even grasses or flowers can escape their desire to just take a bite and see what it tastes like...
