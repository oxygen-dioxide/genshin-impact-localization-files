'''Dream Flowers''' are a type of [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]] found in [[Sumeru]]. They are found within [[Phantasmal Gate]] challenges.

In their normal state, they will clear enemy [[aggro]] for nearby players. If Activated using {{Color|Electro}}, they will mark the locations of the remaining Phantasmal Seeds but lose their aggro-clearing effect. If Scorched using {{Color|Pyro}}, they will only lose their aggro-clearing effect.
