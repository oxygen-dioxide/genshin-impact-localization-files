'''Samachurls''' are shamans and spiritual leaders of [[Hilichurl]] tribes.

In combat, Samachurls mainly cast spells from range, but will perform a single melee strike with their staff if close to the player. They have a great range of offensive and supportive abilities depending on their elemental type.

==Trivia==
* Samachurls are the eldest members of their tribes, and typically take on the responsibilities of making decisions and protecting the tribe.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Hilichurl Cultural Customs|1}}</ref>
* Each variety of Samachurl is believed to worship the element they possess, and their hair and skin are dyed to reflect this.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Hilichurl Cultural Customs|2}}</ref>
* Samachurls have been known to sing songs which seem to carry great philosophical and emotional meaning, but have yet to be deciphered by humans. These songs were recorded in the [[Hilichurl Ballad Selection]].
* In [[Hilichurlian]], the name "samachurl" may derive from the word ''sama'', which is also used to denote black when combined with ''boya'', the word for colors.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian}}</ref>
* When Samachurls are in combat in-game, they chant while casting spells. No official transcription exists for these chants, but unofficial transcriptions from players indicate that at least some of the words chanted are Hilichurlian words.
** Dendro, Geo, and Cryo Samachurls have the same chant. Hydro Samachurls have their own chant, and Anemo Samachurls also have their own chant.
*Samachurls are the only hilichurl subspecies observed to make vocalizations even outside of combat; they pant when running, and chant when walking.
