There's no knowing what devious scheme might be brewing inside his head &mdash; it's really quite maddening... What do you mean, "sly as a fox"? Hmph, if you're trying to insinuate that he and I are anything alike, you are sorely mistaken.

I suppose being blunt and dispensing with tact has its own advantages... But I do hope that the next time she visits the shrine, she keeps to herself. I've got better things to do than answer her incessant questions about Ei.

Word is that she caused quite an uproar among the Tenryou Commission recently by setting off fireworks all over the place. Heh, I'm sure the members of the [[Kujou Clan]] must've turned purple with rage... A pity that I couldn't be there to see it for myself.

Before the [[Sakoku Decree]] came into effect, the two of us would often meet to discuss bilateral relations between our two nations. I always found her quite reliable. The next time you go to Liyue, take her some more fresh [[Sea Ganoderma]] for me.

|vo_08_07_tx         = These Divine Priestesses seem to be getting cuter every generation. I wonder how she looks performing the Dance of Divine Peace... Perhaps even little schools of fish swish around her while she spins. If she's ever looking for a more experienced head shrine maiden to learn from, I'd be quite happy to share a few tips with her... Hehe, as long as she asked me nicely, of course.

|vo_08_09_tx         = Ah, the oddball oni. Heh, I hear that he's been quite a pain for the Kujou Clan. The [[Tenryou Commission]] wanted to remove his messages on the bulletin board, claiming that they were "harmful to public order." I made quite sure they stayed put, haha. He's an entertaining character... you don't often see oni like him in this day and age.

|vo_08_11_tx         = Ah yes, the little ninja child... If there's one thing she can do, it's stay hidden. [[Kano Nana]] constantly complains to me about it. Apparently, she now spends so much of her time searching for Sayu that she barely has any time to read anymore. If you ask me, I'd say that Sayu has a secret ally who is helping her hide all the time...

Although she comes from a family of shrine maidens, she's gone her own way in life &mdash; tried her hand at many different trades, studied abroad in Liyue, even ended up joining the [[Arataki Gang]]... Fascinating girl. Maybe I should have Miyuki introduce me. Yes, that'll work &mdash; Miyuki wouldn't dream of refusing my request.

So she told me that as Guuji, I would be able to eat all the Fried Tofu I desired. As if that would be a convincing reason... That woman spoke so much nonsense, honestly, she could be so insufferable...

But, it turns out that seeing frazzled authors scraping the bottom of their barrel in a desperate attempt to get their novels finished is where the real amusement comes from.
