==Profile==
Atea is an important person in [[People of the Springs]] tribe, also a neighbor and a friend of [[Mualani]]. An {{Ancient Name|bearer=1}} [[Ancient Name]] bearer, she bears many scars from years of fighting as one of Natlan's most renowned warriors of the [[Night Warden Wars]]. She was also famous for her love of soaking in the hot springs, and often threw hot spring parties, attended by other respected warriors like [[Liliuo]], [[Kaiulani]], [[Vichama]], and [[Pyro Archon]] [[Mavuika]], to whom she would call her guests her "hot spring buddies". She had experienced being killed at least once in the wars, but her team would survive, allowing her to be brought back with the [[Ode of Resurrection]].<ref name="Home">{{Ref/Quest|Home of the Hot Springs}}</ref>

A few years prior to game events, she was deeply impaled in battle by an [[Abyss|Abyssal]] monster, leaving her with a large scar on her abdomen. The doctors managed to save her life, but her internal organs were infused with Abyssal power causing her body to slowly wither. Not only did this medically disqualify her from fighting on the front line ever again, but it rendered her unable to bathe in the hot springs she so loved as to not speed up the corrosion. Other than that downside this did not severely affect her quality of life, allowing her to continue using her vast combat skills to protect her village. In one Abyss attack on her tribe she ordered several villagers to safety, but a younger Mualani and the others, having no fighting experience, wanted to help in their own way. Mualani saw a monster attempting to attack Atea and diverted its attention to her. She was unable to escape, but Atea was able to kill the monster before it could hurt her.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Mualani|Vision}}</ref> Seven years prior, Atea once saved the life of [[Yelafath]]'s brother during another attack, which she remained very grateful for. Atea would also focus on creating new artificial hot springs, which are cooler than natural springs, so more outsiders could experience the tribe's natural wonders. This was despite the fact she could no longer enjoy them herself, causing Mualani to greatly respect her.<ref name="Home" />

When it was discovered that Atea was secretly using an abandoned hot spring at night, Mualani and Chief [[Amina]] mistakenly believed that she was showing signs of recovery and decided to organize a secret refurbishment of the spring for a surprise party. She was not able to attend on the first day, having volunteered for patrol duty, so they decided to wait for the next day. Unfortunately, that night an Abyss attack on the tribe was repulsed; after closing an Abyssal Pylon, the [[Traveler]] and Mualani noticed more monsters coming from the abandoned spring area. By the time they arrived, Atea had taken care of the pylon there, though the battle had amplified the speed of her corrosion through her exposure to the Abyssal power. Recognizing that Atea would surely die before medical help could arrive, the Traveler suddenly recalled how they unexpectedly purified the [[Teardrop Crystal]] of the Abyss back in [[Mondstadt]]. The Traveler reached out and purifies Atea of the Abyss power to the amazement of the Natlanese and saves her life, but the Traveler could sense that they could not remove the original Abyssal infusion from her organs and that she was in a very fragile state.

During the day of the party, Atea takes a short stroll outside with the Traveler and Mualani for a private chat. She reveals to Mualani that though the Traveler had saved her life, the Abyssal corrosion of her organs from years earlier had already taken their toll regardless and she had known for some time that she was going to die in a few days. Thus, it had not mattered that she used the abandoned hot spring as she was terminally ill and wanted to enjoy it with the time she had left. Accepting her death she shares a hug with Mualani, having witnessed her in battle and reassured that her young friend would be able to continue protecting the tribe in her stead and she would be with her no matter what happened. Before returning to the party, she hands the Traveler her [[Atea's Talisman|talisman]], asking them to bring it to [[Mavuika]] in her stead.<ref name="Home" />

Understanding that Atea's time was near after receiving the talisman, Mavuika was luckily able to see her and was at her side when she died. Atea showed no pain or sorrow though her body was breaking down and her final thoughts being entirely with her tribe and her people, "a hero to the very end."<ref name="Sun Rises and Sets">{{Ref/Quest|As the Sun Rises and Sets}}</ref>

NPC dialogue that becomes available after completing {{Quest|Past and Future}}<!-- Atea remains alive talking with Anaa and Niu throughout Act II of Chapter V --> in which Atea is mentioned strongly hints that she has since passed away.<ref name="Pele Nui" /><ref name="Anaa and Niu" />

After completing {{Quest|The Rainbow Destined to Burn}}, Amina mentions that people were killed and hopes that "they all went to the same place as Auntie Atea." However, her death is not revealed to the Traveler and Paimon until they attend a feast that Amina had organized for them, as their friends were not able to find the time inform them of her demise. At some point after her death, Atea met with Mualani in a dream and was pleased to see her growth, knowing that she would surpass her in the future.<ref name="Sun Rises and Sets" />

Atea's soul later assisted the Traveler in combat against the Abyss in the Night Kingdom.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Journey of Stars and Flames}}</ref>
