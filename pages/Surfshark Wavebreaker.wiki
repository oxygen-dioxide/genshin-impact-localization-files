When they are depleted or when the skill is used again, Mualani's Nightsoul's Blessing will end. The state itself has the following traits:<br><ul><li>Mualani mounts her Sharky Surfboard, increasing Mualani's [[Movement SPD]] and [[interruption resistance]]. Mualani can move on [[water]] and [[Liquid Phlogiston]] while this state is active, and she will take no DMG from the latter.</li><li>Normal Attacks will be converted to Sharky's Bites, dealing Nightsoul-aligned {{Color|Hydro DMG}} based on Mualani's [[Max HP]]. Sharky's Bites can be used in mid-air. DMG dealt this way is considered Normal Attack DMG.</li><li>When she makes contact with opponents in this state, Mualani applies "Marked as Prey" to them and gains 1 Wave Momentum stack. Max 3 stacks. 1 stack can be gained from the same opponent every 0.7s.</li></ul><br>'''Wave Momentum and Marked as Prey'''<br>When Mualani uses Sharky's Bite, her DMG dealt increases based on Wave Momentum stacks. When she has 3 stacks, a Normal Attack will use Sharky's Surging Bite instead, further increasing her DMG and removing all her stacks afterward.<br>When Sharky's Bites hit opponents Marked as Prey, that mark is removed, and she will fire Shark Missiles at up to 5 nearby opponents Marked as Prey, dealing DMG to them equal to this Sharky's Bite instance and clearing their Marks. If more than 1 opponent is the target of Sharky's Bite and Shark Missiles, the DMG dealt will decrease, with 28% being the maximum decrease when at least 3 opponents are targeted.

{{Description|First off, Sharky is a freshwater shark on top of being a surfboard. Second, it's not that it wants to eat for real, just that it definitely bites for real.}}
'''Surfshark Wavebreaker''' is [[Mualani]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|Sharky's Bite or Sharky's Surging Bite|4.5}}
** This particle generation can only be triggered once per surf.
* The '''6s''' cooldown starts once Mualani's Nightsoul's Blessing state ends and not upon the Elemental Skill cast.
* While Mualani is surfing, the [[Fall DMG]] she takes is reduced by '''50%'''.
* {{Point Consumption|<!--

* Each enemy will enter a '''0.7s''' CD before they can be contacted again for another Wave Momentum stack.
* Sharky's Surging Bite is a projectile attack, and it may hit an enemy other than the one originally targeted upon input. If this occurs, the accidentally-hit target will still be hit by a Shark Missile, while the intended target will not take any DMG at all.
