|desc_5 = Closes its petals, consuming one of the "fruits" orbiting around it and creating a {{Color|Cryo|[[Frozen#Frozen Element|Frozen]]}} [[Shields|shield]], giving it ~10 seconds to charge up its attack. If allowed to fully charge, it will bend over, point its top at the player, start spinning like a Gatling cannon and shoot out a rapid volley of projectiles, dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} with each projectile; However, breaking the shield will prevent its attack and stun the Whopperflower for ~15 seconds.
