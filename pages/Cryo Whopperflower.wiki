{{Description|A mimetic plant monster that appears out of nowhere and uses Cryo in combat.<br />These plants lurk under the surface and ambush unsuspecting prey. With the passage of years, sufficient nutrition, and the right environment, it could even take root somewhere and grow into a giant Cryo Regisvine...|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Burrow:''' Sinks into the ground and emerges nearby.
*'''Ambush:''' If the player interacts with a disguised Cryo Whopperflower, bursts from the ground, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}.
*'''Spin:''' If the player is within melee range, flattens while spinning its petals to deal '''50% ATK * 3''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} around itself.
*'''Normal Attack: Crystalline Spikes:''' Shoots out trails of spikes from the ground near the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
*'''Charged Attack: Frost Cannon:''' Closes its petals, consuming one of the "fruits" orbiting around it and creating a {{Color|Cryo|[[Frozen#Frozen Element|Frozen]]}} [[Shields|shield]], giving it ~10 seconds to charge up its attack. If allowed to fully charge, it will bend over, point its top at the player, start spinning like a Gatling cannon and shoot out a rapid volley of projectiles, dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} with each projectile; However, breaking the shield will prevent its attack and stun the Whopperflower for ~15 seconds.
*'''Recharge:''' Once all three "fruits" are consumed, the Whopperflower will plunge into the ground and restore all three, creating a visual AoE but will not deal any DMG.
