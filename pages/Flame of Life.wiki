'''Flame of Life''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Sumeru]]. When one is picked up, the accumulation of Decay in [[Withering Zone]]s is decreased by one unit.

Each Withering Zone has a fixed number of Flames of Life<!-- as in, the number is different for every Zone --> that will spawn. Flames of Life that are collected will not respawn unless the area is reloaded, after which they will respawn.

Flames of Life in most Withering Zones will only spawn after clearing the three Withering Branches. A small number of Withering Zones may have Flames of Life that spawn immediately.
