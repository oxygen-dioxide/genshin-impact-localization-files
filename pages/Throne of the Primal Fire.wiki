{{Description|Once the site of the throne that belonged to the first [[Pyro Archon]], [[Xbalanque]], this is also where he borrowed the [[Ronova|Ruler of Death]]'s power to establish [[Natlan]]'s rules. A thousand years have now passed, and in this place [[Capitano|another human hero]] has "frozen" life and death, here forever to remain...}}
{{Location Intro|description=<p>[[Offering]] [[Blazing Flint Ore]]s to the Throne of the Primal Fire will increase [[Primal Flame Resonance]] level and unlock bonus effects at each [[Constellation]] level for the [[Traveler (Pyro)|Pyro-aligned Traveler]].</p>

<p>The point of interest will only appear after completing {{Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}. Before the quest, the throne is a part of [[Cradle of Fleeting Dreams]] and has a depiction mural of [[Och-Kan]].</p>

<p>In order to offer the ores, the player's active character must be a {{Pyro}}-aligned Traveler &mdash; attempting to do so with another character will automatically cancel the action.</p>}}

==Trivia==
*The scene resembles and is likely an homage to a scene from [[w:c:Wowpedia:Warcraft|Warcraft]] featuring [[w:c:Wowpedia:Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] sitting on the [[w:c:Wowpedia:Frozen Throne|Frozen Throne]].
