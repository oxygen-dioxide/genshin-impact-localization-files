The '''Sponsian''' was the prized flagship of Fontaine's Navy. [[Basil Elton]] was its captain. It was an armored warship fitted with heavy cannons and a sturdy prow for ramming.<ref name="Tidal">{{Ref/Weapon|Tidal Shadow}}</ref>

Some of the Sponsian's wreckage can be found on a beach near the [[West Slopes of Mont Automnequi]]. A ghostly apparition of the ship's front half can be seen in various places around [[Elton Trench]] and [[Salacia Plain]].

==Crew==
All of the members are either dead, missing, or with fates that are unknown.
* [[Basil Elton]] &mdash; Captain
* [[Nathaniel Pickman]] &mdash; First Mate
* Second Mate (unnamed)
* Chief Engineer (unnamed)

There were also "boys and girls" on board the ship, but their ages and affiliations are unclear. It may have just been an affectionate nickname that Basil used to address the crew.<ref name="Lone Sail">{{Ref/Quest|The Lone Phantom Sail}}</ref>

==Appearance==
The ship is described as ironclad and pure white in colour.<ref name="Tidal" />

==Story==
The Sponsian earned its name by the First Mate Nathaniel Pickman, which was originally the name of a usurper. After the ship got wrecked in a certain incident, Basil retired from her office as the Admiral of Fontaine's navy and moved on to become the vice-director of the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]].<ref name="Tidal" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ann's Story}}</ref>

When the [[cataclysm]] struck, the Sponsian would soon be repaired and set off with the crew to face the beast [[Elynas]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Nymph's Dream|Odyssean Flower}}</ref> During the battle against Elynas, the other ships of the Fontaine Armada would also follow the Sponsian. However, monsters from the [[Abyss]] were attracted and thus, many crew members were evacuated by the Second Mate.<ref name="Lone Sail" />

A machine operating on the ship displayed a reading which showed zero chances of survival for the rest of the crew who remained on board, the known members left being Basil, Nathaniel, and the Chief Engineer.<ref name="Lone Sail" /> Eventually, the crew lost to Elynas and thus, were killed. The other ships of the Fontaine Armada sunk during the battle.

One half of the Sponsian can be found on shore as of the current game events. The Traveler speculates that the other half was swallowed by Elynas.<ref name="Lone Sail" /> The remains of the fleet that followed the Sponsian into battle are now scattered across Elton Trench, which became known as the "Graveyard of Ships".<ref>{{Ref/VP|Graveyard of Ships}}</ref>

===Present===
In the {{Quest|The Lone Phantom Sail}}, the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] encounter the Melusine [[Ahes]], who is keen to learn about the Sponsian. Apparently, Ahes was informed by fellow melusine [[Verenata]] about the Traveler's hallucinations of seeing the Sponsian while under the effects of her "Truesight Potion."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|"Hey, This Isn't Pumpkin Soup..."}}</ref> They track down the Sponsian using an old conch used for military communications. This trail then leads to the surface, where the wreckage can be found. The Traveler suddenly manages to recount the experiences of Basil and even heard her voice, described to be "sorrowful".

It turns out that Ahes has gained the recognition of Basil and she trusts the [[melusine]] to take care of the wreckage. Ahes then plans ahead to restore the ship's logbook and piece together Basil's adventures.
