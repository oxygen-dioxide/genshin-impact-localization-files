<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Saimon Jirou is the missing son of [[Saimon Katsumi]] and [[Saimon Eri]] of [[Konda Village]].

More than a year ago,<ref name="missing">{{Ref/BB|Missing Person Bulletin Board}}</ref> Jirou was part of a group of "young gangsters" in Konda Village. One night, they got too drunk and robbed one of the Shogunate's cargo carts.<ref name="konda">{{Ref/Quest|A Strange Story in Konda}}</ref> To stop the influence that this group had on their son, his parents pressured him into enrolling in the [[Shogun's Army]].<ref name="konda" /> He stayed in the army for some time, occasionally sending letters to his parents<ref name="missing"/> and making ties with his brothers-in-arms [[Ishikawa]] and [[Ono]]. He eventually deserted and cut ties with everyone by doing so, including his parents and causing them great worry, and wandered for some time. He heard of some treasure and tried to find it on [[Jinren Island]], only to be caught by a band of ronin and detained in a cage.

After [[The Farmer's Treasure|many twists and turns]], the [[Traveler]] eventually frees him from his captivity and teams up with him to find the treasure he was originally looking for. Unfortunately, the treasure does not live up to the expectations and this adventure all for nothing makes him become more down-to-earth, forgetting his dreams of adventuring and wanting to become a farmer in his hometown of Konda Village. Despite his worries of being caught as a deserter, his father was able to acquire a forged document that stated he was unfit for service, albeit at a high cost.

===Appearance===
Saimon Jirou is a tall young man with a thin build. He has fair skin, brown eyes and black hair in a bowl cut. He wears typical male Inazuman clothing in blue, gray, white and black and wears black sandals with black and white striped-straps.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing "The Farmer's Treasure")
:'''Saimon Jirou:''' Ahh... I&mdash;It's you... I'm really sorry about the treasure, and for having caused you so much trouble. Anyway, I'm very thankful for your help!
:'''Saimon Jirou:''' Will you continue to travel? To be honest, I never want to leave my house again after what happened...
:{{DIcon}} How are you doing lately?
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' Not too bad, all thanks to you.
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' The [[Tenryou Commission]] has been here asking about my whereabouts as well. Good thing dad covered for me.
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' He somehow went and got a certificate saying I was unfit for service. Of course, the name on it says "Saimon Katsumi"!
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' Though it was quite expensive, at least I don't have to worry about being treated as a deserter...
:{{DIcon}} What are your plans for the future?
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' The future? Hah, do I look like someone who has a future to speak of?
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' ...Hey, hey, I'm just kidding. After that near-death experience, I've become extremely optimistic about the future.
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' I'm done with the adventuring though. My focus should be my family for now...
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' It just so happens that many of the village fields have gone barren. I'll spend my time farming and living life like the rest of the people here.
::{{DIcon}} You've become more down-to-earth, I see.
:::'''Saimon Jirou:''' Heh, I suppose so.
:::'''Saimon Jirou:''' My parents are getting old as well, so I can't just sit around and do nothing.
:::'''Saimon Jirou:''' And Konda Village is a place with history. I've also learned my lesson from last time...
:::'''Saimon Jirou:''' This time, I plan to stay home and wait for fortune to come to me! Maybe one day I'll dig up some old artifact and I'll be rich!
:::'''Saimon Jirou:''' Ahem... I mean... I'll have enough money to provide for my parents...
::{{DIcon}} Come on, where's your ambition?
:::'''Saimon Jirou:''' Shh! You'll get me yelled at by my father...
:::'''Saimon Jirou:''' I start trembling whenever I think of what happened before... I don't dare to have any ideas at this point...
:::'''Saimon Jirou:''' I'll just tend to the fields, and who knows? Maybe one day luck will come my way.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Saimon Jirou:''' Yup! Good luck to you in your travels!
