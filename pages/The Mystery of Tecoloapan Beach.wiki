'''''The Mystery of Tecoloapan Beach''''' is a [[World Quest]] in [[Tecoloapan Bay]], [[Natlan]]. Completing this quest will remove the fog from the island, allowing it to show on the [[Map]].

* Approach the foggy [[Tecoloapan Bay]] (initially ???) on the west end of Tezcatepetonco Range across the water to start the quest
# Unveil the secrets of the island within the fog
# Undo the island's seal(s)
# Continue undoing the island's seal(s)<!--
-->{{Enemy List|Forged Sand Interrogator/Abyss-corrupted Nightsoul variant;Forged Sand Shieldbreaker/Abyss-corrupted Nightsoul variant;Tepetlisaurus Warrior: Shard Striker/Abyss-corrupted Nightsoul variant}}

# Talk to the Wayob manifestation
# Return to the surface
* ''Optional:'' Talk to Sakaw

==Gameplay Notes==
* During Step 5, the [[Weakened Wayob Manifestation]] will fight alongside the player as a [[Biting-Cold Wayob Manifestation]].
* Completing this quest grants the {{Achievement|Truth Cannot Be Fabricated}} and a [[Luxurious Chest]].
* After completing this quest, the fog over Tecoloapan Bay will disperse, and its actual name will appear on the map instead of "???" upon entering the area.
* Sakaw will have different dialogue if spoken to before and after completing this quest. His post-quest dialogue can only be accessed if he is spoken to immediately after the quest completes (the player will automatically be teleported near Sakaw when the quest ends). Leaving the area or engaging any loading screens will cause him to disappear.

;(Defeat the mimic Abyss-corrupted Wayob Manifestation)
:'''Weakened Wayob Manifestation:''' Ah, at last... Were it not for your aid, outlander hero, we might have long been overwhelmed by our pitch-black foe...
:'''Weakened Wayob Manifestation:''' ...Long ago, the tribespeople here were ensorcelled, enchanted by our enemy, and many Nightsouls became entangled by the [[Abyss]].
:'''Weakened Wayob Manifestation:''' At the seal's location, even the power of Night's manifestation is slowly being chipped away... This seal severs all links with the outside world, yes, but with the source of the tribe's faith also.
:'''Weakened Wayob Manifestation:''' It must be undone for there to be any fighting chance...
:'''Weakened Wayob Manifestation:''' Thank you, outlander hero... The Nightsouls can find their way back to their dream-home, avoiding the blight that grips the [[Lord of the Night]]'s realm.
:'''Weakened Wayob Manifestation:''' Ah, at last, to be able to return to the quietude of Night...
