The '''Golden Apple Archipelago''' is a limited time summer event area located east of [[Mondstadt]] that first appeared in [[Version 1.6]] and appeared again in [[Version 2.8]] in the [[Summertime Odyssey]] event with a different look. It was historically known as the '''Haar Islands''' before the events of [[Midsummer Island Adventure]]. This area contains a set of islands that the [[Dodo-King]] invited [[Klee]] to in the quest [[Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown]].

The archipelago is the first location released where the player can be introduced to the [[Waverider]] [[Game Systems|system]].

Many of the archipelago's elements have later reappeared at [[Inazuma]].

==History==
{{see also|Golden Apple Archipelago/History}}
{{Quote|These islands are isolated from the outside world, like a secret Domain crafted by nature itself.|Jean, [[Summer Vacation: Proceed With Caution]]}}
According to [[Venti]], the archipelago used to be called the '''Haar Islands'''. The islands were created during the terraforming of [[Mondstadt]]; as [[Barbatos]] reshaped the region, he split off the tops from mountains which then landed upside-down in the sea, becoming the archipelago.<ref>Event [[Echoing Tales]] Conch Retrospection, VI: Familiar Voices - [[Echoing Tales/Story#VI: Familiar Voices|An Archon's Deeds]]</ref> Lisa also mentions it "belonging to no nation", likely meaning it is located in neutral waters.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown}}</ref>

The area appears to be operated by an unusually large mechanism that has not yet been revealed.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Summer Vacation: Proceed With Caution}}</ref> Initially, the islands were covered in dense fog, which made travel to the islands extremely dangerous and inaccessible to most. This, along with the changing tides and winds, also made it difficult to escape once anyone made it to the islands. While [[hilichurls]] can be found on the archipelago both before and after the islands' rising, it is unknown if the hilichurls had been there first or somehow sailed to it.

Civilization began on the Haar Islands with one shipwrecked group that lived on the archipelago for many generations. Many people tried escaping; it remains unknown if any of them were successful. Around 500 years later, [[Ako Domeki]] and his pirate fleet were shipwrecked on the island after [[Asase Hibiki]] unleashed a [[Thunder Manifestation]] during a battle between his and the Shogunate's forces on [[Seirai Island]]. Domeki's fleet also included a stolen [[Maguu Kenki|samurai puppet]] that protected the islanders until it was damaged and rendered inactive. Then, with the help of the pirates, an escape route was devised that took advantage of the archipelago's unusual features. As it seemed likely that the escape route would work, everyone left the islands.<ref>Event [[Echoing Tales]]: [[Echoing Tales/Story|Conch Retrospection]]</ref> It is not known what happened to the local inhabitants. However, Domeki and his fleet returned to Seirai Island, which was now in ruins.

Some years after the archipelago became abandoned, the events of [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] occurred in the present day. [[Klee]] received a letter from "[[Dodo-King]]" threatening to take Dodoco away from her unless she could prove herself. With the assistance of the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], Klee was able to find the location of the archipelago as well as the means to get there, with Acting Grand Master [[Jean]] and Deaconess [[Barbara]] also deciding to come with her for her safety. The five were taken to the archipelago by [[Dvalin]], summoned by Venti. There they would begin looking for "Dodo-King" and learn about the archipelago's mysterious history in the process.

The group is eventually joined by [[Kaeya]], [[Diluc]], [[Albedo]], and [[Razor]], who were also flown to the archipelago by Dvalin but became separated when Razor jumped off mid-flight. Each also received a letter from Dodo-King with varying, personal messages catered to their concerns, causing everyone to become wary of the true identity of Dodo-King.

After solving the mystery, it is revealed that [[Alice]], Klee's mother, had brought the group to the archipelago so she could ensure that her daughter had a memorable summer vacation. She had visited the area before and found the scenery and history beautiful and spent some time dressing up the islands for her daughter's enjoyment.

==Trivia==
* "Haar" (cognate with the English "hoar"), which was used in the archipelago's older name, refers to a type of cold, thick sea fog that is brought rolling in by the winds.
* After completing [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait]], the NPCs seen during the quest remained in different islands of the map until the end of [[Midsummer Island Adventure]].
* The archipelago is one of the only areas in-game which contains [[Local Specialties]] of multiple regions:
** [[Dandelion]]s from [[Mondstadt]]
*** As well as [[Philanemo Mushroom]]s and [[Valberry|Valberries]] during the [[Version 2.8]] rerun
** [[Starconch]]es from [[Liyue]]
*** As well as [[Cor Lapis]], [[Jueyun Chili]]s, [[Qingxin]] and [[Violetgrass]] during the Version 2.8 rerun
** [[Sea Ganoderma]] from [[Inazuma]] (labeled as "Regional Specialty" before [[Version 2.0]])
*** As well as [[Naku Weed]] during the Version 2.8 rerun.
* [[Celestia]] cannot be seen in the sky from the Golden Apple Archipelago, unlike in the [[Teyvat]] map.
* During Version 1.6 (after the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event), any players that reached [[Adventure Rank]] 21 can reach the Golden Apple Archipelago.
** The Golden Apple Archipelago could also have been reached even before completing any [[Archon Quests]].
* The large [[Pyro Slime]] and [[Cryo Slime]] that can be found south of the Teleport Waypoint in [[Minacious Isle/2.8|Minacious Isle]] during the Version 2.8 rerun is a callback to how [[Diluc]] kept accidentally burning [[Kaeya|Kaeya's]] ice bridge after the brothers tried to trek their way to one of the islands after jumping off of [[Dvalin|Dvalin's]] back during the Midsummer Island Adventure event in Version 1.6.
* In the [[Twinning Isle/2.8|Twinning Isle]] during the Version 2.8 rerun, the Raven Squire Night Raven Statue wondering how to knock out three training dummies at once is a reference to the [[Ellin, the Wannabe Knight]] Daily Commission.
