|description    = A chirpy little bird, found in nooks and crannies all over Teyvat.<br>Snowy white from tip to toe, it enjoys a carefree existence in its snowswept natural habitat. Snow Finches are naturally adapted to cold climates and are highly sensitive to changes in temperature. In warmer environments, they become somewhat fatigued.<br>Sometimes, these birds will gather around [[Tubby]] and doze off together, forming a "drowsy formation." Even people who are in high spirits will be affected when they approach this formation, starting to yawn and feel more sleepy.
