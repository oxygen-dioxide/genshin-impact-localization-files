'''Mona's Master''' (also known as the "Old Hag" by [[Mona]]) is a master hydromancer. It appears Mona's greatest wish is to overtake her in hydromancy and become known as the world's greatest astrologer. She is also the friend and rival of [[Alice]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Astrology and the 50-Year Pact}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beyond This World's Stars}}</ref> a famous adventurer and powerful mage. She is only talented in astrology, whilst Alice was well versed in a variety of magical fields.

Considering both her student<ref>{{Ref/VO|Lisa|About Mona...}}</ref> and rival's<ref>{{Ref/CS|Barbara|Alice's Idol Magazine}}</ref> affiliation with the [[Hexenzirkel]], she is highly likely to be a member of the organization too.
