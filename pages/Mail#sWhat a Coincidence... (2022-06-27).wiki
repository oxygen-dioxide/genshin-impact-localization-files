|text    = Well, well, well. Right after [[Mail/Hehehe... (2022-06-26)|yesterday's letter]], here's another one from me. Don't worry, there won't be any tomorrow. Come to think of it, are you too sad about it to read this letter, little one?

If so, rest assured. It won't make any difference whether you read this letter or not, because I don't put sappy words into a letter. You, little one, are a fun person. It would be much more interesting to see your reactions in person.

Right, here are a few [[Sakura Bloom]]s that I collected in my spare time. To preserve them for a long time, you might want to make them into a bookmark, and put it between the pages of your favorite light novel.

How about... I personally recommend one to you?
