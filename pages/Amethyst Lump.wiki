{{Description|An uncut crystal that can only be found in [[Inazuma]]. Some professional craftsmanship will bring out its true value.}}
'''Amethyst Lump''' is a [[Forging Material]] item exclusively found in [[Inazuma]]. They are used when [[Forging]] for [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]] and a variety of [[weapons]].

They can be harvested by attacking their destructible nodes, dropping 1-3 Amethyst Lumps each. Like all [[Geo Constructs]], it is faster to destroy them using [[Blunt Attack]]s and {{Geo}} abilities. Their respawn rate is 72 hours.

In [[Co-Op Mode]], each nearby player will get their own drops with amounts randomized separately and players will not be able to see others' drops. Unlike most [[Materials]], they cannot be affected by {{Anemo}} abilities that may move them.
