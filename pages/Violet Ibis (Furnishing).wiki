|description    = A graceful bird with broad wings and slender legs.<br>It has beautiful violet feathers and enjoys walking across streams or paddy fields in silence. It is referred to as the "Uraume Bird" in ancient Inazuma songs. Once present everywhere, they seem to have become more and more rare. Perhaps the Realm Within can provide a suitable place for them to rest.
