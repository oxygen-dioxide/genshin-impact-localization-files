:'''Kusi:''' Well, that's my weight under control, but... Hmm? What's up?
:{{DIcon}} Might I ask your name?
::'''Kusi:''' Ah, right. I'm one of the sentries stationed here, although I'm in vacation mode right now...
::'''Kusi:''' So if something's come up, go look for the fella beside me, [[Yukom]]!
:{{DIcon}} Something on your mind?
::'''Kusi:''' Well, y'see, I've been getting a little heavier lately, so I've added lots of healthy veggies to my usual Grainfruit diet.
::'''Kusi:''' But for some reason, my buddy [[Ur]]'s been copying me by eating a whole bunch of grass... Not a disaster, since [[Saurian]]s are omnivores, but I worry he can keep up with all his nutritional needs, eating all that grass...
::'''Kusi:''' Guess I need to give him a bit of a talking-to later.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing, really.
::'''Kusi:''' Sure. Safe travels, then, outlander.
