* Adds a new Quick Swap feature for "Treasure Compasses" and "[[Oculus Resonance Stone]]s" which can automatically swap these gadgets based on the region your character is in (you can enable this setting via the pop-up prompt that appears when you first use one of these gadgets after the update or by selecting one of them on the "[[Gadget]]s" tab of the [[Inventory]]).
