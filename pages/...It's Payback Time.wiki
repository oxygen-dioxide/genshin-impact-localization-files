'''''...It's Payback Time''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Challenger: Series VII]]''. To complete this achievement, the player must destroy [[Shouki no Kami]]'s shield while he is delivering a powerful barrage of attacks.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Since Shouki no Kami's shield is continuously depleted during the fight, the opportunity window to earn the achievement is slim. In order to break the shield at the right time, the Neo-Akasha Terminal's aimed mode attack should be used on Shouki no Kami once at some point before he begins Cosmic Bombardment and once during Cosmic Bombardment.
* To ensure a second Neo-Akasha Terminal attack, break the Cryo/Pyro/Hydro constructs that Shouki no Kami summons for additional energy crystals.

==Trivia==
* The Chinese and Japanese names of this achievement reference a story in the 3rd century BC philosophical book ''{{w|Han Feizi}}'', in which a man sells both shields and spears, boasting that his shields are so solid that nothing can pierce them, and that his spears are so sharp that they can pierce anything. When someone asks the man what would happen if one were to strike his shields with his spears, he is unable to respond. This is a famous example of the {{w|irresistible force paradox}}, and coined the word {{zh|{{wt|矛盾}}|rm=máodùn|tl=contradiction|lit=spear-shield.}}
** The Chinese name is specifically derived from the saying {{zh|以子之矛，攻子之盾|rm=yǐ zǐ zhī máo, gōng zǐ zhī dùn|tl=to turn one's weapon against its owner|lit=to use one's spear to attack their shield,}} which has its origins in this story.
