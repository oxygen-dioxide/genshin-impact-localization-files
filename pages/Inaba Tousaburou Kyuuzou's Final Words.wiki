==Text==
Again, sincerest apologies.<br />
The old saying "fifty years of life" speaks about the fifty years we have to live. I, [[Inaba Kyuuzou|Tousaburou]], have lived more than thirty years, and won't have the luxury of enjoying the rest, which I hope to share with Father and Mother instead.<br />
[[Inaba Shizuko|Shizuko]], my beloved wife, please do not be angry or sad. There can be no redemption for my misdeed. I merely hope that you can forget your failure of a husband.<br />
Masa, Matsu, please don't feel any regret for me, and please forgive me.<br />
Friends new and old, I am very honored to have met each and every one of you.<br />
Whatever the case may be, I am very sorry.<br />
I, Tousaburou, am no man of culture, and writing is not my expertise. However, I find myself having much to say in my last goodbyes.<br />
If anyone is reading this, please forgive my chattiness.

Ten or so years ago, when I first joined the military, I admired the valor and vigor of our great [[Ogosho]]. I yearned to be part of the thunder-struck battles for justice that heroes and legends from hundreds of years ago took part in. I hoped to one day be able to fight and die for true "Eternity."<br />
Now that I think about it, the immature mind of a young man often confuses legends of the past with the present. I actually thought I had the chance to become the perfect hero, like our great Ogosho.<br />
When war actually broke out, our enemies were not demonic attendants or twisted monsters from the abyss. They were ordinary people, just like you and me.<br />
The foes I slew a few days ago may very well have been drinking buddies of mine at the [[Uyuu Restaurant]] the very day the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] took effect. Or perhaps, some recently-fallen comrade might have been someone that I just had a joyful conversation with.<br />
We should've been brothers, yet we discarded all possibilities of returning to what was good. We had to hate each other, so that we ourselves may survive.<br />
The cruelty and brutality of it all...<br />
This so-called "just war" is the greatest sin.

Though I, Tousaburou speak such scandalous words, I do not blame Her Excellency the Shogun for any of it.<br />
Her Excellency once said thus: since ancient times, wars have been divided into "just" and "unjust" wars.<br />
Unjust wars are born from the swelling of "desire" and the chaos of mortal hearts.<br />
Her Excellency means to collect Visions throughout the world in an effort to realize "Eternity." This is a feat no less than the slaying of the [[Orobashi|Great Serpent]] hundreds of years ago.<br />
Using war as the method to rid the world of all who carry delusion in their hearts, and to put an end to the possibility of injustice ever happening &mdash; there can be no war more just.

However, any war has its fair share of cruelty, and it is the people fighting that war who bear the burden of responsibility. I no longer have the strength to continue to serve, and only hope to use what is left of my body to bear my share of sin for Her Excellency.<br />
I hope that her era of eternal prosperity may be realized soon.

My name is Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou, and this is my sincerest apology.
