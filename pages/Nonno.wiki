Nonno is a playful, childish soul, that likes to play hide and seek. She praises the Traveler if they find her, before hiding at another place.

===Appearance===
Nonno is, like any other intractable lost soul on Tsurumi island, a light blue, almost transparent figure with a white, glowing point at the place of her heart. She doesn’t have any limbs or any details on her face.
