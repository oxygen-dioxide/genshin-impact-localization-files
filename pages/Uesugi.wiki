==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Uesugi:''' Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!
:'''Uesugi:''' Traveler, what can I help you with?
:{{DIcon}} Who might you be?
::'''Uesugi:''' I'm [[Doushin]] Uesugi of the [[Police Station]]. I'm a new recruit who just joined recently. Nice to meet you.
::'''Uesugi:''' The Police Station's task is to maintain law and order in Inazuma. Our job is to handle the neighbors' reports.
::'''Uesugi:''' However, these reports are mostly just little troubles that people run into during their daily life. There are also some amazingly clumsy mistakes...
::'''Uesugi:''' Though I don't mind helping them take care of their problems, I still wish that I could handle some big cases so that my skills can finally be put to good use...
::'''Uesugi:''' Otherwise, I'm going to end up like [[Owada]] &mdash; insignificant until my retirement. Honestly, I don't want to become like him at all.
::{{DIcon}} Isn't it good to have peace, though?
:::'''Uesugi:''' Ah, I didn't mean that... Of course I wish the residents peace. But something is bound to happen, isn't it?
:::'''Uesugi:''' I sometimes see the retainers of the [[Kamisato Clan]] going out for missions. And [[Ryuuji]] from the detective agency is often busy with cases. I always find it unsettling seeing how casual things can get at the Police Station.
:::'''Uesugi:''' As a Doushin of the Police Station, trying my best to take care of everyone's issues should be my job, right?
:::'''Uesugi:''' As such, I sometimes also work with Ryuuji to handle some cases. That sense of accomplishment when we finish a case is something that you don't get from working at the Police Station, hehe.
::{{DIcon}} Clumsy mistakes?
:::'''Uesugi:''' Well, it's all thanks to that [[Arataki Itto]].
:::'''Uesugi:''' While the Vision Hunt Decree was in effect, he was defeated by Madam [[Kujou Sara]]. He has been conjuring up a plan to take his revenge since then.
:::'''Uesugi:''' Madam Kujou Sara saw he was very serious about the revenge, and that his fighting spirit was commendable. So they picked a day for another duel.
:::'''Uesugi:''' ...Somehow, Arataki Itto insisted that, due to some weird Oni rules, the rematch must be a sumo showdown at the crossroads...
:::'''Uesugi:''' That's just too weird! I mean, it's basically harassment against Madam Sara, right?
:::'''Uesugi:''' Anyway, the duel didn't happen in the end. Arataki was dragged away by some [[Kuki Shinobu|masked lady]]... I just hope that Madam Sara won't be affected by this..."
:{{DIcon}} Have you ever seen someone who looks like me?
::'''Uesugi:''' A missing family member case, huh... I see, please elaborate further.
::'''Uesugi:''' Yeah... yeah... I have jotted it down. Leave it to me. If I find anything related, I will contact you at the first opportunity I get.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Uesugi:''' Goodbye. Remember to report to me if you see anything suspicious.
