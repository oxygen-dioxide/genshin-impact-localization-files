'''Kuki {{Lang|Miyuki'''|ja=幸|ja_rm=Miyuki}} is an open-world [[NPC]] initially located in [[Kujou Encampment]], [[Inazuma]], where talking to her starts the ''[[Tatara Tales]]'' World Quest Series. After completing it, she moves south to overlook one of the [[Thunder Sakura]], where she can be talked to again to start the World Quest ''[[Sakura Arborism]]''.

After both quests are finished, she moves to the stairs towards the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]].

==Profile==
Miyuki is a shrine maiden at the Grand Narukami Shrine, belonging to the [[Kuki Clan]] who has long served the shrine. She is the older sister of [[Kuki Shinobu]], the deputy of the [[Arataki Gang]]. Back when Shinobu planned to leave the shrine, Miyuki intended to persuade her not to, but after seeing that Shinobu had received a [[Vision]], she changed her mind and decided to help her persuade their parents to let her go her own path instead.

The [[Traveler]] first meets Miyuki at the Kujou Encampment, where she was found arguing with [[Tenryou Commission]] officer [[Toranosuke]] regarding the situation at the [[Mikage Furnace]]. Toranosuke believed that the Grand Narukami Shrine overstepped their bounds by ordering the evacuation of the furnace, hindering the war effort, while Miyuki fired back that the [[Tatarigami]] was growing out of control and that the Tenryou Commission was not doing their job properly. With Toranosuke's superior, [[Hanbei]], having headed to [[Inazuma City]] to deal with "proper procedures," the two were left at an impasse, resolved only by [[Xavier]] and the Traveler taking matters into their own hands.

With one crisis resolved, Miyuki turned her attention to the deteriorating Thunder Sakura around Kannazuka and noticed a particular [[Treasure Hoarder]] camp loitering around the trees. The Traveler helped her investigate the situation and discovered that [[Hideaki]]'s group and Fatui were collaborating to take Electro-filled sap from the Thunder Sakura and empower an [[Electro Hypostasis]]. The two foiled the scheme and Miyuki captured Hideaki for interrogation.

===Appearance===
Miyuki wears the standard shrine maiden uniform consisting of a white ''kosode'' and red ''hakama'', white ''tabi'' socks, and regular ''okobo'' sandals with red straps. Her long brown hair and bangs are let down.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Miyuki:''' Hi there, you can come to me if there's anything you need help with.
:'''Miyuki:''' I have to work harder in my duties as a shrine maiden to earn the approval of Lady Yae, after all.
:{{DIcon}} What are a shrine maiden's duties?
::'''Miyuki:''' Our duties are obviously to obey the commands of Lady Guuji Yae!
::'''Miyuki:''' I will do my best to complete any instructions Lady Yae gives me, just as I did in [[Tatarasuna]]. I won't ever let her down.
::{{DIcon}} About Tatarasuna...
:::'''Miyuki:''' The problem with the Mikage Furnace has been resolved thanks to your help. You have my gratitude.
:::'''Miyuki:''' I've never worked in a place so far away, and I heard many interesting stories along the way.
:::'''Miyuki:''' It's said that the [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya troops]] are actually led by a [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|shrine maiden]]. I never thought that a shrine maiden would be able to command a battlefield at the frontlines...
:::'''Miyuki:''' I wish I could meet her, I'm quite curious as to what she's actually like...
:{{DIcon}} Lady Yae's approval, huh...
::'''Miyuki:''' Yes! Lady Yae praised me after I completed my mission in Tatarasuna. That was the happiest moment of my life!
::'''Miyuki:''' That's why from that day on. I've decided to work even harder to serve Lady Yae. I want to become a shrine maiden whom Lady Yae can count on even more than [[Kano Nana]]!
::'''Miyuki:''' *sigh* I really don't understand why Lady Yae and Kano Nana are so close. She even shares her secrets with her...
::'''Miyuki:''' Hmph. I mean, I can outperform her in many ways, for sure!
:{{DIcon}} I'll not bother you. Goodbye.
::'''Miyuki:''' *sigh* So you don't need any help?
::'''Miyuki:''' Alright then, I guess I'll keep waiting on Lady Yae's instructions...
