'''Miyuki''' {{Lang|ja=幸}} is an [[NPC]] initially located in [[Kujou Encampment]], [[Inazuma]], where talking to her starts the ''[[Tatara Tales]]'' World Quest Series. After completing it, she moves south to overlook one of the [[Thunder Sakura]], where can be talked to again to start the World Quest ''[[Sakura Arborism]]''.

After both quests are finished, she moves to the stairs towards the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]].

==Profile==
Miyuki is a shrine maiden of the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] and the older sister of [[Kuki Shinobu]]. The [[Traveler]] first met her at the Kujou Encampment, where she was found arguing with [[Tenryou Commission]] officer [[Toranosuke]] regarding the situation at the [[Mikage Furnace]]. Toranosuke believed that the Grand Narukami Shrine overstepped their bounds by ordering the evacuation of the furnace, hindering the war effort, while Miyuki fired back that the [[Tatarigami]] was growing out of control and that the Tenryou Commission was not doing their job properly. With Toranosuke's superior, [[Hanbei]], having headed to [[Inazuma City]] to deal with "proper procedures," the two were left at an impasse, resolved only by [[Xavier]] and the Traveler taking matters into their own hands.

With one crisis resolved, Miyuki turned her attention to the deteriorating Thunder Sakura around Kannazuka and noticed a particular [[Treasure Hoarder]] camp loitering around the trees. The Traveler helped her investigate the situation and discovered that [[Hideaki]]'s group and Fatui were collaborating to take Electro-filled sap from the Thunder Sakura and empower an [[Electro Hypostasis]]. The two foiled the scheme and Miyuki captured Hideaki for interrogation.

===Personality===
Miyuki is described as a "considerate and capable young lady" by [[Xavier]] and takes the honor of the Grand Narukami Shrine seriously in order to not disappoint Yae Miko. She has a fixation with Lady Yae and works hard to earn her approval, even saying that the day Lady Yae praised her after completing the mission in Tatarasuna was the happiest day of her life.

Miyuki is rather bold, standing up to a Tenryou Commission soldier and later personally chasing down Hideaki and his Fatui cohorts. While the Traveler is preoccupied with the Electro Hypostasis that Hideaki awakens, Miyuki chases the Treasure Hoarder around for three laps before Hideaki collapses from exhaustion, allowing her to capture him.

===Appearance===
Miyuki wears the standard shrine maiden uniform consisting of a white ''kosode'' and red ''hakama'', white ''tabi'' socks, and regular ''okobo'' sandals with red straps. Her long brown hair and bangs are let down.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Miyuki:''' Hi there, you can come to me if there's anything you need help with.
:'''Miyuki:''' I have to work harder in my duties as a shrine maiden to earn the approval of Lady Yae, after all.
:{{DIcon}} What are a shrine maiden's duties?
::'''Miyuki:''' Our duties are obviously to obey the commands of Lady Guuji Yae!
::'''Miyuki:''' I will do my best to complete any instructions Lady Yae gives me, just as I did in [[Tatarasuna]]. I won't ever let her down.
::{{DIcon}} About Tatarasuna...
::'''Miyuki:''' The problem with the Mikage Furnace has been resolved thanks to your help. You have my gratitude.
::'''Miyuki:''' I've never worked in a place so far away, and I heard many interesting stories along the way.
::'''Miyuki:''' It's said that the [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya troops]] are actually led by a [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|shrine maiden]]. I never thought that a shrine maiden would be able to command a battlefield at the frontlines...
::'''Miyuki:''' I wish I could meet her, I'm quite curious as to what she's actually like...
:{{DIcon}} Lady Yae's approval, huh...
::'''Miyuki:''' Yes! Lady Yae praised me after I completed my mission in Tatarasuna. That was the happiest moment of my life!
::'''Miyuki:''' That's why from that day on. I've decided to work even harder to serve Lady Yae. I want to become a shrine maiden whom Lady Yae can count on even more than [[Kano Nana]]!
::'''Miyuki:''' *sigh* I really don't understand why Lady Yae and Kano Nana are so close. She even shares her secrets with her...
::'''Miyuki:''' Hmph. I mean, I can outperform her in many ways, for sure!
:{{DIcon}} I'll not bother you. Goodbye.
::'''Miyuki:''' *sigh* So you don't need any help?
::'''Miyuki:''' Alright then, I guess I'll keep waiting on Lady Yae's instructions...
