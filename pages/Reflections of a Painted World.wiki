;(Interact with the viewpoint)
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' ...Ah... Hero from a distant land...
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' Please, heed my words. I am the guiding night-raven, both a memory of our [[Lord of the Night]]'s poetic musings... and merely one of a billion notions amidst the moonlight.
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' Incline your ear unto me, for the spirit river beneath the earth has been shattered, and I can only speak to you via this image, to urge you &mdash; beware the [[Abyss|pitch-black foe]].
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' That broken mirror once beamed forth reflections bright. But now, dark smoke has gradually spread into three areas. Remember them well:
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' First, the east, where shadows have emerged from where they once hid, within the [[Malinalco Grotto|murals of legendary heroes]].
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' The west is second, where, upon a [[Tecoloapan Bay|sea of mystery]], darkness manifests, affecting a galling parody of the lord of deepest night.
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' Third lies beneath the cliffs, where a [[Pale Mist|pale fog]] that should have dissipated now spreads as [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|Cinder City]] stirs...
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' O outlander hero, be wary... Tread lightly where our pitch-black enemy roams. Beware the all-corroding foe.

;(Sit on the stool again, optional)
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' Tread lightly where our pitch-black enemy roams. Beware the all-corroding foe.
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' Is there anything you wish to know, O outlander hero?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the murals with the heroes...
::'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' Find them in the east, within a cavern where glowing trees sway and flutter. There, just as storytellers holding their woven scrolls say, lies also a terror hidden in stories from the past.
::'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' Perhaps that shadow seeks to escape its imprisonment through those very stories...
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me what lies atop the sea of mystery...
::'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' To the west, an island lies obscured by fog. Once, it was a sacred ritual sanctuary, populated by those who made a pact with the {{sic|[[Iktomisaurus|Ikotmisaurs]]}} long ago.
::'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' But oozing filth emerged therein, and the holy site became a dark cesspit, sealed away and forgotten... Ah, but our cunning foe would never give up quite so easily...
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me of the pale fog...
::'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' That defiled fog was first created when the ancient city, Ochkanatlan, was destroyed. It should have been sealed away... But time and memory are against us...
::'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' If only... Alas... If only someone could dispel the pale fog once more...
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} No, I don't need to know anything at the moment.
::'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' Ah... Remember, remember... Be wary, be vigilant...
----
;(Sit on the stool after resolving all matters)
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' I can sense it, O outlander hero... I can sense all that you have done.
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' A mighty feat indeed, O hero. The corroded power is now returned to the [[Night Kingdom|realm of Night]], and I can hear the Nightsouls rejoice.
:'''Will of the Mysterious Graffiti:''' ...Take these as your recompense, hero, for those who achieve greatness should not lack reward.
