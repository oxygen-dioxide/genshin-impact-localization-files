{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Aberaku)
:'''Aberaku:''' My name is…
:'''Aberaku:''' Aberaku, [[Helios]]-Forger!
:'''Paimon:''' Um, what's the Helios?
:'''Paimon:''' Is it something very impressive?
:'''Aberaku:''' Verily! T'was I who organized the building of the Helios with the might of an entire nation behind me, that we might resist the Dragonheirs of the Depths.
:'''Aberaku:''' This unsurpassed deed could have been done by no other in Byakuyakoku &mdash; none save I!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Guess that is pretty impressive.
:'''Paimon:''' But why would such a great person be sealed in here?
:'''Aberaku:''' I... I was betrayed...
:'''Aberaku:''' When the sky kingdom crashed into the bottomless depths, the people were scourged by dragons, and thus did I &mdash; yes, 'twas I &mdash; begin building the Helios to save all from our fate.
:'''Aberaku:''' But... those ravening rogues! The moment their lives were no longer in danger, they began to deceive and lie. They even advocated placing mere infants on the throne. Laughable!
:'''Aberaku:''' Even I became the target of their schemes, and was left in jail to rot!
:'''Aberaku:''' A pox! A pox upon them all!
:'''Aberaku:''' ...Right. You.
:{{DIcon}} Me?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, I think he's talking to you.
::'''Paimon:''' Nah, he's clearly looking at you.
::'''Paimon:''' (With a very heated look in his eyes, too.)
:'''Aberaku:''' It can only be you!
:'''Aberaku:''' My sacred robes were once placed here, but they have all but rotten away in the passing of years, and can no longer be relied upon.
:'''Aberaku:''' But if you can pass the test, then I shall hand the offerings, into which I have nested my thoughts, unto you.
:'''Aberaku:''' I pray for your... success...
:'''Aberaku:''' This matter is perilous. Tell me once you are ready, O Traveler, and we shall begin.

;(Talk to Aberaku again to activate the sprit's trial)
:'''Aberaku:''' Are you fully girded up, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready.
::'''Aberaku:''' Then I wish you... every success in your battle ahead.
:{{DIcon}} I need a while more to prepare.
::'''Aberaku:''' Then I shall await your tidings.

;(Talk to Aberaku again to obtain the offerings from the spirit)
:'''Aberaku:''' I-Incredible! You may just be able to do this...
:'''Aberaku:''' Please then, I beg you, carry these offerings... the offerings... you must...
:'''Aberaku:''' You must take them away to...
:'''Aberaku:''' To...
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh brother, his words are getting less and less clear!
:'''Aberaku:''' Take them to the place of enshringing... enjoin the parts of my soul, in order to...
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, Mr. Spirit?
:'''Aberaku:''' In order to... In order to...
:'''Paimon:''' In order to do what again?
:'''Aberaku:''' In order to...
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, this guy isn't making himself clear at all! But it seems we're supposed to take these offerings somewhere - Paimon got that much.
:'''Paimon:''' These offerings have been here for so long. Who knows if there's anything edible here.
:{{DIcon}} Best not to eat them all the same.
:'''Paimon:''' H-Hey! Paimon doesn't just eat anything, alright?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, let's take the offerings with us anyway, (Traveler).
