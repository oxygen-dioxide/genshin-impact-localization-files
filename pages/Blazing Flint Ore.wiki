'''Blazing Flint Ore''' is a [[Very Special Item]] obtained after reaching [[Tribe Reputation]] Level 4 with various tribes in [[Natlan]].

A total of '''6''' Blazing Flint Ore can be obtained.

==Usage==
Before completing {{Quest|Incandescent Ode of Resurrection}}, attempting to use Blazing Flint Ore brings up a dialog with the following text:
* '''Wait for the moment to activate this item'''

After clearing the aforementioned quest, each Blazing Flint Ore can be offered to the [[Primal Flame Resonance|Throne of the Primal Fire]] to unlock bonus effects at each [[Constellation]] level for [[Traveler (Pyro)]]. The offering will only be successful with Traveler (Pyro) as the active character. Attempting to use the Blazing Flint Ore from the menu will cause the game to offer to teleport the player to the Throne of the Primal Fire.

All Blazing Flint Ores in inventory must be offered at once. There is no option to offer less than what is currently owned.<!--E.g., Unlike Statue of the Seven-->
