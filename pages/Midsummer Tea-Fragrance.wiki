|description    = A lush tree that seems to glow like tea leaves in the bright daylight. Every year when midsummer comes along, these trees will give off a light and sweet fragrance. In truth, the plants of this tree cannot really be eaten, much less brewed into a tea. To prevent children from being attracted to this aroma and chowing down on this plant's leaves, several parents invented the story of "[[Specters]] and Strong Tea," claiming that Specters eat these leaves. Upon hearing this, the children have learned to keep their distance.
