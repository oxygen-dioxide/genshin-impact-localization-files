Katarina and her younger brother [[Nikolay]] were orphans raised in the [[Harbinger]] [[Arlecchino]]'s House of the Hearth, where Katarina became close with fellow orphan [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking}}</ref> After they grew older, all three became members of the [[Fatui]], with both Katarina and Lyudochka being trained as [[Fatui Electro Cicin Mage]]s.

Katarina and Nikolay were members of the Ninth Company when it was dispatched to The Chasm to investigate the mysterious forces that arose after the miners discovered the Wish Granter, a fragment of the [[Chasm Nail]] that had somehow split off from the main crystal. However, the Ninth Company faced disastrous blows while attempting to address the [[Abyssal corruption]] they discovered in The Chasm, which resulted in Nikolay's disappearance when he used himself as bait to draw away monsters from the rest of the squad. Refusing to abandon her brother, Katarina elected to stay in the depths of The Chasm even after her comrades escaped to the relative safety of higher grounds.<ref name="ACVID">{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}</ref><ref name="LFL2">{{Ref/Quest|Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking}}</ref>

===Personality===
Katarina is very close to her brother Nikolay and her fellow orphan Lyudochka, even seeing the latter as a sister due to her teasing and caring for her. Despite this, she also makes it clear that she expects them to be fully loyal to the Tsaritsa and would not hesitate to kill them if they brought shame to her name. She is critical of the [[Traveler]]'s wariness of her and constant reminders that the two of them may come to blows again, remarking that "Kids who haven't grown old enough to hold their liquor tend to get drowned in all sorts of strange worries."

===Appearance===
Katarina has the appearance of a Fatui Electro Cicin Mage.

==Story==
Katarina and Nikolay were orphans raised in the House of the Hearth as "children" of the [[Tsaritsa]]. There, Katarina grew close to Lyudochka, whom she calls "even dearer than a real sister." Katarina gifted Nikolay a {{w|balalaika}} which he greatly treasured, bringing it with him everywhere. After the three were trained as soldiers for the Fatui, Nikolay was assigned to the Ninth Company; Katarina was initially assigned to an unspecified regiment but was later transferred into the Ninth Company. Upon hearing the news, an overjoyed Nikolay wrote her a letter, a memento of his that she treasured dearly and kept on her person at all times.<ref name="LFL2" />

===Present Day===
Sometime after The Chasm's closure two years ago, and before the events of the [[Chapter I|Liyue Archon Quests]], [[Signora]] made a deal with the [[Liyue Qixing]] which included a Fatui-Qixing collaboration to investigate the strange occurrences at The Chasm. The Ninth Company was dispatched to The Chasm under the impression that this operation was a mutually beneficial agreement free of any other conspiracies or objectives. Unfortunately, while that was true of their operation, the same could not be said for [[Tartaglia]]'s mission (and Signora, who was using Tartaglia to complete ''her'' mission): To obtain [[Morax]]'s Geo [[Gnosis]] by any means possible.<ref name="ACVID" />

Following Tartaglia's resurrection of [[Osial]] and the threat that the Fatui posed to [[Liyue Harbor]], the Qixing nullified their prior agreements with the Fatui and cut off the Ninth Company's supply lines.<ref name="ACVID" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Undetected Infiltration}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Ninth Company had met disastrous results in their investigation themselves. While they had ultimately discovered the Chasm Nail, the Mokosh Device they brought to purify the Abyssal corruption was overloaded and destroyed instead,<ref name="FAL">{{Ref/HEO|Fatui Action Logs}}</ref> while nearly half their original 64 members were killed in action, including their Captain.<ref name="ACVID" /> While searching for a path to the Chasm Nail, Katarina may have been the "Snezhevna" who rang one of the Ancient Bells in the [[Nameless Ruins]], which caused the [[Abyss Lectors]] Egill and Agnarr to emerge from the dark fog and incur heavy casualties for the Ninth Company.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Perils in the Dark}}</ref>

In the chaos, Nikolay used himself as bait to lure their enemies away from the rest of the squad and disappeared. Refusing to abandon her brother, Katarina decided to stay in the depths of The Chasm, even as [[Anton]] and other survivors moved back to relative safety in higher ground. By this point, they realized that their supply chain had been cut, but had no way to find out what had occurred on the surface.<ref name="ACVID" /><ref name="LFL">{{Ref/Quest|Lost in a Foreign Land}}</ref>

Eventually, the Traveler discovered Katarina during their own investigation of The Chasm. Taking each other for enemies, the two attack each other, with the fight drawing to a close after the Traveler defeats her and she begs for them to stop. Due to the classified nature of the Fatui's operations, Katarina refuses to divulge much about their situation, when they attempt to interrogate her.<ref name="LFL" /> Eventually, however, she discloses that she had gotten lost in her search for Nikolay and asks them to search for him, or evidence of where he had disappeared to. The Traveler only found fragments of his diary and his bloodied insignia in the southern ruins at [[Stony Halls]], and with the only path ahead blocked by fallen rocks, his survival was uncertain. Katarina thanked them for their findings and decided to go look for him.<ref name="LFL2" />

Upon returning to Nikolay's last known location, the Traveler finds a [[Shadowy Husk: Line Breaker|Shadowy Husk]], with Nikolay's letter which Katarina had cherished so much lying on the ground, implying she either was killed or was severely wounded but managed to escape.<ref name="LFL2" />
