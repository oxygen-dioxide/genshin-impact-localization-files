==Description==
An ancient bow, as hard as cast iron, that once belonged to a famed archer.<br>
He once slew monsters and bandits like silvergrass in the wind.<br>
As he pursued mastery in the discipline of archery,<br>
his string sang like unrelenting thunder,<br>
and his arrows shone like sun-soaked iron rain.

In his twilight years, the archer had a revelation.<br>
"The ultimate profundity of speech is the word withheld, and the ultimate profundity in archery is the arrow spared."

Thereafter, he never spoke again of arrows shot out of the sky. Nor did he speak again of the foul monsters slain by iron arrows shot from an iron bow.

He buried his bow in the ground and went to live as a hermit amidst the hills.

Allegedly, the story of his death is as follows:<br>
Every night, as the sound of a plucked string rang out from his home, a ray of brilliant purple light shot forth, and foul monsters dared not approach.<br>
On the night of his death there was a storm. Amidst the howling wind and rain there was but a single clap of thunder. The accompanying bolt of lightning shot upwards, towards the sky, burning bright as the stars in the galaxy.

==Trivia==
*[[Tartaglia]] is seen wielding this bow in his [https://youtu.be/3f2-EANyrNM official Character Demo] and in [https://youtu.be/RfTgT81cVxE Collected Miscellany - "Childe: Foul Legacy" | Genshin Impact].

===Etymology===
*The Chinese name of the bow {{zh|s=弓藏|t=弓藏}} is a part of the ''chengyu'' (idiom) {{Lang|"[once] the birds are annihilated, the [good] bow is put away"|zh=鸟尽弓藏|zh_rm=niǎojìn-gōngcáng}}. It figuratively means an able person will lose their position once they have served their purpose. This aphorism is used as a reminder that one should not stand out too much because doing so will invite the envy of their boss and colleagues.
*The archer's revelation that "the ultimate profundity in archery is the arrow spared" is most likely a reference to the phrase {{Lang|"to Shoot without shooting"|zh=不射之射|zh_rm=bùshèzhīshè}}<ref>Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/不射之射/5414278 {{zh|不射之射}}]</ref> in ''{{w|Liezi}}'', an ancient Chinese text that describes the philosophy of Taoism. The whole story of the lore may be inspired by the Japanese novel ''Legend of the Master'' written by {{w|Atsushi Nakajima}} (who in turn took inspiration from several episodes of ''Liezi''), which was later made into a movie by {{w|Shanghai Animation Film Studio}} as ''To Shoot without Shooting''.
