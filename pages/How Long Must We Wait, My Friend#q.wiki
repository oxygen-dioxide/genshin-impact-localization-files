{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After awakening the stone serpent)
:'''Paimon:''' Wha... Why's that big guy moving all of a sudden?

;(When the stone serpent returns for the first time)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, it even brought us a treasure chest... Wait, is it because it knew we were helping back there?

;(When the stone serpent returns for the second time)
:'''Paimon:''' Another treasure chest... Is it getting these from under the lava?

;(When the stone serpent returns for the third time)
:'''Paimon:''' It's back again! It's another treasure&mdash; Ah, no, it's [[Coagulation Pearl|a mechanism]]...

;(Approach the marked location)
:;(A [[#Tutorials|Tutorial]] opens)

;(Start the mechanism)
:{{Black Screen|As the giant rock serpent swims a few laps in the lava, the liquid Phlogiston inexplicably begins to solidify into stone...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? The lava turned into Pulverite... Where'd the big guy go?

;(Approach the marked location and touch the stone serpent)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! The big guy's here! Is it trying to get through that strange barrier?

;(After the [[Secret Source Servant]] dispels the barrier)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so the big guy was here to rescue the little one inside...

;(Ride the stone serpent again)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so you've been guarding this place on orders from someone...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon doesn't know when that someone will return...
