The '''Narzissenkreuz Institute''' was an organization in [[Fontaine]] which was established to raise orphans and the children of criminals. It is prominent for being involved in the lives of many major Fontainian figures during and after the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago.

After the disappearance of the Director Lyris and the death of the Vice Director Basil Elton over the course of the cataclysm, the Narzissenkreuz Institute disbanded.

The location of the Narzissenkreuz Institute is now the submerged [[Annapausis]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Search in the Algae Sea (Quest)|quote = '''Seymour:''' I have an underwater locomotion module. Once, Mary-Ann and I... dove down to the ruins of the orphanage, whose coordinates were the same as those of Annapausis.}}</ref>

==Overview==
The exact date of the Narzissenkreuz Institute's founding is unknown. It was given the name "Narzissenkreuz" since the building was established over the ruins of an ancient civilization; it is also described as a "home [...] that would not see the light of either sun or moon,"<ref name="Tea Party">{{Ref/Arti|Heroes' Tea Party}}</ref> presumably referred to [[Annapausis]] (the location of the Institute) being located in a cave and now have been submerged. The Institute is led by the Director Lyris, who was a gentle-natured [[Oceanid]] as the position was established in honor of the first Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]]. The Vice Director Basil was chosen from those with "exceptional moral quality and ability."<ref name="Ann">{{Ref/Quest|Ann's Story}}</ref>

In Narzissenkreuz Institute, play-acting was a common pastime, with the children acting out the roles of Narzissen champions, wicked mages, evil dragons, and heroes. Afternoon tea and tea parties were a regular part of life at the Institute, and the Vice Director's refreshments were particularly good.<ref name="Tea Party" />

There are indications that some members of the Institute might have closer links to the [[element]]s than regular humans. [[Rene]] notes that his and Jakob's bodies were similar in composition to that of the "sacred lotus," likely referring to the [[Gaokerena]] formed from the remains of [[Egeria]], but it had no commonalities with the body composition of Mr. [[Karl Ingold|Karl]], the third expedition member. With the revelation that Fontainians originates from the [[Primordial Sea]] and [[Oceanid]]s, it may indicate that Rene and Jakob were Fontainian while Karl was not. Later, when assessing the lackluster results he obtained from [[Khaenri'ah]]n [[Azosite]], Rene states that it was because "the object they chose was pure elemental force, which lacks any will whatsoever," and proceeds to liken it to "the difference between the [[Lyris|Director]] and a [[Hydro Slime]]."<ref name="ReneNote">{{Ref/Item|Rene's Investigation Notes}}</ref>

==History==
Presumably since the founding date, the Institute was led by a gentle-natured Oceanid named [[Lyris]] as its Director. The second-to-last generation of the Institute included [[Emanuel Guillotin]], [[Basil Elton]], [[Karl Ingold]], and [[Dwight Lasker]].<ref name="vessel">{{Ref/Arti|Forgotten Vessel}}</ref> At some point, Basil Elton was appointed as its Vice Director following her retirement. [[Carter Scherbius]] also joined the Institute, presumably sooner than [[Rene]] and others.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Ancient Log|Ancient Log #2}}</ref> Rene de Petrichor, [[Jakob]], [[Alain]],<ref name="ReneNote" /> and [[Mary-Ann]]<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Nymph's Dream}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Mary-Ann's Story}}</ref> were among the last generation in the Institute. Rene and Jakob's parents were most likely killed during the [[Siege of Poisson]],<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (II)}}</ref> while Alain and Mary-Ann's origin was unknown.

===The Cataclysm===
To stand against the destruction of the cataclysm, both Lyris and Basil left the Institute sometime before Rene and Jakob went to the [[Girdle of the Sands]] as part of their own research on ways to put an end to the disaster. Alain remained at the Institute.<ref name="ReneNote" /> Basil perished at sea while Lyris and the "sisters" she left with never returned.<ref name="flower">{{Ref/Arti|Odyssean Flower}}</ref> While Rene's remarks suggest she was rather powerful, he conveys his doubts about her survival.<ref name="ReneNote" />

Before departing, the Vice Director left the dark green feather in her hat in the hands of Jakob, and she entrusted Rene with the task of taking care of another member of the Institute.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Wicked Mage's Plumule}}</ref><ref group="Note">Considering that there are two blanked-out names in Wicked Mage's Plumule's description, and the feather is stated to have "reach[ed] the source of that which caused the calamity of parting," it is possible that the two names are meant to be Rene and Jakob's. The two traveled together to Khaenri'ahn ruins to study their power sources; other lore related to Khaenri'ah reveals that much of their technological advancement was derived from [[forbidden knowledge]] and the [[Abyss]], which led to the cataclysm.</ref>

Following a great flood which presumably destroyed much of their home, Rene and Jakob went to the Girdle of the Sands to research new energy sources, using [[Khaenri'ah]]n research as their basis. The two were accompanied by [[Karl Ingold]],<ref group="Note">Given that Karl was involved at Poisson shortly before the Siege of Poisson alongside Jakob and Rene's parents, it seems likely that the "Mr. Karl" in Rene's Investigation Notes was Karl Ingold.</ref> although Rene and Karl distrusted each other and Rene went through some great lengths to keep Karl from finding out a certain secret. The two also argued over the usage of a certain power which was blamed for the massive flood. Rene and Jakob eventually made a breakthrough, however, and departed from the ruins to report their findings to Alain.<ref name="ReneNote"/>

===Legacy===
The members of the Institute "scattered" after it became evident that the Director and Vice Director would never return. Some were taken in by the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] or the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol and worked to protect Fontaine, while some were taken in by explorers and adventurers and moved abroad.<ref name="flower" />

Based on Basil's request, some of the kids would be adopted by her friends Karl Ingold and Emmanuel Guillotin in case she would not return. Karl likely adopted Rene and Jakob and accompanied them to the Girdle of the Sands, while Emmanuel adopted Alain and Mary-Ann.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Veteran's Visage}}</ref>

Alain enrolled in the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]], while Mary-Ann joined the Marechaussee Phantom. Rene and Jakob also joined the Institute of Natural Philosophy by Alain's recommendation.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (IV)}}</ref> Follow an incident with Alain's assistant Carter Scherbius, the relationship between Alain and Rene fell off.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (V)}}</ref> 

Lyris survived the Cataclysm and returned to Fontaine, dwelling in the now-surmerged Institute. However, she was severely weakened, either by the battle or the different nature of Fontaine water that only produced [[Tainted Hydro Phantasm]] instead of pure Oceanid. Rene and Jakob first discovered her, Mary-Ann and [[Seymour]] also visited her sometimes.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (VII)}}</ref> 

Rene established a secret [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]] with most of the Institute of Natural Philosophy's members using Jakob's trick to mesmerise them, and Lyris, who agreed to his plan. Alain left the Institute of Natural Philosophy and joined the Marechaussee Phantom with his sister.

Alain eventually went on to establish the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], which is dedicated to studying machines and energy.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vibro-Crystal Reharmonization}}</ref>
