{{Description|When the last Jade Chamber crashed, its great store of precious items was scattered across the waters around Guyun Stone Forest, and still require patient collection and careful retrieval. Defeat the interfering monsters and beat back the Treasure Hoarders who are here to claim a share, and seize these precious items back!}}
'''The Great Gathering''' is part of the [[Fleeting Colors in Flight]] Event in [[Version 2.4]].

==Summary==
* Complete [[Petal-Lit Ships Fish For the Moon]] to unlock this event segment.
* During the event, Travelers can head to [[Guyun Stone Forest]] to defeat enemies that are on land and in the sea to recover scattered materials. As the Salvage Progress advances, you can unlock the challenges "Midpoint Interception," "Return to Safe Harbor," and "The Key Catch." After completing the challenges, you can further recover materials.
* During the event, there will be [[Waverider Waypoint]]s near Guyun Stone Forest. Travelers can unlock the Waypoints to summon the [[Waverider]] to complete the challenges at sea. The Waverider can only operate near the Guyun Stone Forest and will be sent back if it exceeds the boundaries.
* The elite Treasure Hoarders in the camps can embolden themselves to increase their defence. You can use Quelling Firecrackers from the firecracker boxes in their camps to deal AoE Pyro damage and remove the elite Treasure Hoarders' buffs.
* Upon completing the challenge, you can obtain rewards such as [[Immaculate Talisman]]s, [[Primogems]], [[Hero's Wit]], and [[Mora]].
* Immaculate Talismans can be exchanged at the [[Fleeting Colors in Flight#Afterglow Market Stage 2|Event Shop: Afterglow Market Stage 2]] for rewards such as various Lantern Rite event-exclusive Furnishing Blueprints.
* After the event gameplay ends on 2022/02/12 03:59:59, the Waverider and the Waverider Waypoint near Guyun Stone Forest will disappear.

{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial The Great Gathering 1.png
|text1  = The ocean surface near the Guyun Stone Forest is filled with flotsam from the Jade Chamber's wreckage. Sail your Waverider into the designated areas and defeat nearby opponents to retrieve items from the Jade Chamber's collection. Some of these items have already been salvaged by the Treasure Hoarders. Head to their camps and defeat them to repossess the items.
|image2 = Tutorial The Great Gathering 2.png
|text2  = The elite Treasure Hoarders in the camps can embolden themselves to increase their DEF. After obtaining Quelling Firecrackers from firecracker boxes in their camps, you can throw them to deal Pyro DMG to opponents in a large AoE in front of your active character. This attack will also dispel the elite Treasure Hoarders' buffs.
|image3 = Tutorial The Great Gathering 3.png
|text3  = Sail the Waverider and destroy the Treasure Hoarders' transport balloons before they can reach their destination. Do this as quickly as possible to achieve the best results.

|image4 = Tutorial The Great Gathering 4.png

|image5 = Tutorial The Great Gathering 5.png
|text5  = Defeat the Treasure Hoarder elites to prevent them from making off with items from the Jade Chamber. Use the Quelling Firecrackers to dispel their buffed states and also deal immense DMG to them.
