The '''Scions of the Canopy''', or '''Huitztlan''', is one of the six tribes in [[Natlan]]. They can be found at the [["Scions of the Canopy"]] suspended off the cliff-face of the [[Coatepec Mountain]].<ref name="Attainment">{{Ref/Arti|Moment of Attainment}}</ref> Their current chief is [[Wayna]].

==Overview==
The people of this tribe are known to be skilled explorers, messengers, and hunters, and they live alongside the [[Yumkasaurus]]. The Scions of the Canopy's region is inhospitable, but young people still come there because they like challenges. Extreme sports are also popular in this tribe.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/3kU5vRFr2Tg Stop Motion Animation: "Natlan Tribe Introductions"].</ref> These are perhaps factors as to why the local [[Adventurers' Guild]] is mostly made up of the Huitztlan.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame (Quest)}}</ref> Furthermore, the Scions of the Canopy celebrate the night of the so-called [[Turnfire]] to commemorate their ancestors. Their current chief is [[Wayna]]. It is also the tribe of origin of the current [[Pyro Archon]], [[Mavuika]].

==Lore==
According to legend, in the distant past, an ancestor of the tribe, Yupanqui, stole a flame called the [[Turnfire]] from the tyrant [[Och-Kan]] and used it against his forces. Yupanqui himself would also fall victim to the Turnfire, causing him to burn for a hundred days and pierce a hole in the [[Ley Lines]], falling into the [[Night Kingdom]], where the Turnfire is said to still be burning to this day. The Turnfire would become synonymous with Yupanqui's [[Ancient Name]], '''Malipo'''.

During the era of the [[cataclysm]], the hero Burkina and his Yumkasaur companion [[Kongamato]] joined the hero [[Tenoch]] and the Pyro Archon Mavuika in fighting against the [[Abyss]]. Kongamato became corrupted by the Abyss, and in order to save him, Burkina, the current bearer of the '''Malipo''' name, summoned the power of the Turnfire, sacrificing himself in the process. After this incident, Kongamato's lifespan was greatly enhanced, allowing him to live for centuries, thus becoming a living symbol of the tribe's glory, now known as the Mountain King. After the cataclysm, Mavuika's sister, [[Hine]], helped rebuild the tribe, though her works did not survive to the present day.

The Scions of the Canopy cultivate the Mountain King [[Flamegranate]]s from the Mother Flamegranate Tree to offer to the said Mountain King.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ripe For Trouble}}</ref> and some say that the Yumkasaurs secretly also offer Flamegranates to the Mountain King.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tisoc|quote= '''Tisoc:''' There are people whose job it is to pick and offer up these Flamegranates for the Mountain King's consumption. However, some say that in secret, other Yumkasaurs bring them to the Mountain King too...
 }}</ref> In order to cleanse his abyssal corruption, the Scions of the Canopy hold a ceremony called the Turnfire Night, typically annually. The ceremony involves sending a delegation led by a flame bearer, traditionally the current bearer of the '''Malipo''' name, to cleanse the corruption. The flame bearer will light braziers with a kindling of the [[Sacred Flame]], taking it into the Mountain King's cave.

As of {{Quest|The Last Turnfire Night}}, Kongamato's corruption has been permanently stabilized. Kongamato now offers his services to train the Scions of the Canopy.

==Trivia==
* Many members of the Scions of the Canopy have {{W|Quechuan languages|Quechuan}} names.
* Mavuika being born in this tribe, may be a nod to the myth of the birth of the {{w|Aztec}} solar and war deity: ''{{w|Huitzilopochtli}}''. Like the mountain in which the Huitztlan tribe is located, ''Huitzilopochtli'' was born in a mountain called ''Coatepec''; it was also the place where he fought her sister ''{{w|Coyolxauhqui}}'' and his 400 Centzonuitznaua.
* The {{Furnishing Mentions|Scions of the Canopy|are=1}}

===Etymology===
* Like the other known tribes, Huitztlan is likely derived from Ilhuicatl-Huitztlan, one of the Aztec {{w|Thirteen Heavens}}, each of which has various gods living in and ruling over it.
** Ilhuicatl-Huitztlan ({{w|Nahuatl}}: ''Ilhuicatl'' "sky;" ''huitzli'' "thorn;" ''tlan'' "place") means "the sky where the thorns are." It is also interpretated by some authors as "place of the path of the sun."
