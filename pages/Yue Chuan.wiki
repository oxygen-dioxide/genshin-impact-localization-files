==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
He used to meet with a friend in that place, but it's been a while since the last time they saw each other... albeit he strongly believes that they're soulmates with a strong connection, so he comes to this spot every day, searching for a letter or a gift from her.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yue Chuan:''' Do you need something? I'm a little busy...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Yue Chuan:''' Can you not see that I'm looking for something?
::'''Yue Chuan:''' By the way... I wonder if you've seen a girl I know?
::'''Yue Chuan:''' She sometimes comes here for a stroll, always dressed beautifully &mdash; you can tell just by looking that she's from {{sic|an}} well-to-do family.
::{{DIcon}} I've never seen her.
::'''Yue Chuan:''' Oh...  Well, she's my good friend. I haven't seen her recently, though, because she hasn't come here in a long time.
::'''Yue Chuan:''' I figure that she must miss me a lot, so she'll have definitely left a gift for me on the beach.
::{{DIcon}} How can you be so sure?
:::'''Yue Chuan:''' How could I be wrong!?
:::'''Yue Chuan:''' I know I'm poor but honestly, me and her are soulmates! We have a connection!
:::'''Yue Chuan:''' I come here to the seaside every day to see whether she has left a message or a gift for me. My efforts will not be in vain!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Have you found that letter?
:::'''Yue Chuan:''' Um, not yet. At the moment, all I've found are these crabs.
:::'''Yue Chuan:''' Darn them, their pincers are plenty painful! And they'll pop right back up after a while even if you throw them to the shore.
:::'''Yue Chuan:''' I'm in a bind as to how to take care of them, so why don't you take them? Mind you don't get pinched, though.
::;(Obtain [[Crab]] ×5)
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it...
::'''Yue Chuan:''' Bye-bye!
::'''Yue Chuan:''' Ooh... What's that? It's so shiny...
