==Description==
A delicate scroll treated with wax to prevent decay and moth damage.<br>
It contains the research of royal mages &mdash; research which is still rather forward-looking to this day.<br>
The royal mages were tasked with nourishing the water and soil as well as fighting off monsters. They also served as tutors for the nobles.<br>
Therefore, the scroll contains a wealth of information regarding history, governance, management, and culture.<br>
When the people overthrew the royals, they exiled the royal mages at the same time,<br>
For the mages had forsaken their responsibility to instill goodness and virtue in the nobles, instead becoming birds of a feather with them.

In the early days of [[Mondstadt]], the [[Lawrence Clan|Lawrence clan]] was led by [[Venerare]].<br>
Under her guidance, the people built a tall statue in the plaza to commemorate the miracle of the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]]'s descent.

The inscription beneath the statue was put there by the leader of all the clans. It bore an oath of protection to Mondstadt that they had sworn.<br>
Over the years, the Lawrence clan forsook the noble aspirations of their forebears, and the statue was taken down.<br>
The wise mages of the court spoke neither of history nor of the oath ever again.

In the age of the [[Knights of Favonius]], the statue was rebuilt.<br>
But the wording of the oath on the inscription was lost forever.
