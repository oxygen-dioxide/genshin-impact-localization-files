==Description==
Gurgling water once flowed into the yellow sand, but that was a long time ago.<br>
The great being would follow the brontides and divine will into the desert in latter days, but few would survive in the end.<br>
The fish that once shot forth like an arrow across a huge lake on the plateau,<br>
That would stretch out as straight as a spear, cruising back and forth between the sacred sites,<br>
Would see its stream seep into the sand, its lake shrink into a puddle,<br>
Till at last, it wound up curled in a little plash, at the mercy of passing pilgrims.

The lesson of this story is as such:<br>
As long as your are pious and kind, you can get a fish even in the midst of the desert sands.
