|text      = After residing for so long in the mountains, one has never paid much heed to the celebration of one's day of birth, much less sought to advertise it.

But [[Ganyu]] suggested that it might be a fine occasion to invite some close friends over for a feast, which sounded to one's ears like a rather pleasant idea indeed...

One just so happens to have been working on a mechanism that can create all sorts of snacks and desserts, and thought it was high time to demonstrate its faculties to all of you. In combination with the tea that one recently procured, one worries only that the young ones might get a little carried away.

Many friends have already arrived, both old and new, so why don't you join us for a repast too?

You needn't go to the trouble of preparing a gift — your presence will be sufficient.
