==Descriptions==
{{Description|A type of mammal that resides in the watery regions of Fontaine. It communicates with its companions through melodious sounds.<br>Due to its density, water is a much more efficient medium of sound than air. Drawing inspiration from the Blubberbeast, someone from the [[Fontaine Research Institute|Research Institute]] invented a type of technology that converted images into data to facilitate instant transmission. But due to the technical limitations of the experiment, it never became widely adopted outside the Institute.<br>In reality, however, data transmission technology based on fluid and sound has existed since ancient times. As the saying goes, there's nothing new under the sun.|[[Archive]]}}
