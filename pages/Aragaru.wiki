==Trivia==
* There is a bug wherein some of Aragaru's dialogue will trigger when the player explores through the depths of Chatrakam Cave even after they have already completed the Quest.

===Etymology===
* "Aragaru" might be derived from {{W|Garuda}}, the divine king of birds and the mount of the deity {{W|Vishnu}} in Hinduism.
** This is based on the interpretation that [[Aranaga]] and [[Aranakin]], who are also involved in ''[[Agnihotra Sutra]]'', are named after heavenly beings.
