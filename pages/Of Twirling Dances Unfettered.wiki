|description    = A grand and lovely theater. In many things — the magnificent stage, the mists of the spouting fountain, and the many precious flowers brought to life by [[Sub-Space Creation]] — this place imitates the festive atmosphere of [[Zubayr Theater]].<br />They say that some shows are best appreciated at night. The placement of the theater lamps seems to be the result of careful study that aims to maximize the clarity with which each audience member can see the dancers, no matter the angle they are sitting or standing at, while the illumination and glow of the lamps are also adjusted just right to maximize the brightness of the scene.
