{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Mt. Laixin'''|zh=来歆山|zh_rm=Láixīn-shān}}|description={{If Self|Mt. Laixin|It|Mt. Laixin}} is unlocked during the {{Quest|An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade}}.

It is referred to as "the sacred mountain," and is where the spirit veins of Chenyu Vale converge. Thus, controlling Mt. Laixin allows one to control all land in Chenyu Vale.<ref name="ASAB">{{Ref/Quest|An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade}}</ref>}}

Attempting to access the area before it is unlocked will result in the field of view turning red before triggering an [[Out of Bounds]] reaction. Most notably, the out of bounds area does not appear in a shade of red on the map and instead appears colorless.
