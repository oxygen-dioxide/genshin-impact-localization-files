==Profile==
Vihar first appeared during the [[Sabzeruz Festival]] in ''The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings'', where he was tasked with roleplaying as Farris, the Knight of Flowers.

Vihar once again appeared during another Sabzeruz Festival in ''Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses'', where he was tasked with roleplaying as the Knight of Flowers that time. He accepted the position because he wanted to see [[Dunyarzad]], whom he likes, happy. During the festival he invited Paimon and the Traveler to a guessing game to earn candies.
