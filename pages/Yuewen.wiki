{{Dialogue start}}
:{{A|VO Yuewen All Schemes to Know 01.ogg}} '''Yuewen:''' (Rural life is so idyllic. Living in [[Qingce Village]] would probably feel the same.)

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yuewen:''' This is such a great place to vacation in. Don't you think so?
:{{DIcon}} Did you come from [[Liyue]]?
::'''Yuewen:''' Yes, I did. You can get to [[Port Ormos]] by traveling along the waterway.
::'''Yuewen:''' I just unloaded a batch of cargo there and made a little money, so I planned to rest in [[Vimara Village]] for a while before traveling back to Liyue.
::'''Yuewen:''' But I realized this place is such a paradise to relax in... I really can't bear to leave.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Do you want to settle down?
:::'''Yuewen:''' I've been thinking about this, too.
:::'''Yuewen:''' Perhaps the busy old days have made me become used to running one errand after another...
:::'''Yuewen:''' But I heard the villagers say that there's an old saying in Sumeru &mdash; Ingenuity leads to truth and knowledge.
:::'''Yuewen:''' Maybe a change of mindset or lifestyle would suit me better?
::;(Obtain [[Teachings of Ingenuity]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Indeed.
::'''Yuewen:''' I see you're of the same mind. Excellent.
