;(Talk to Aradashan)
:'''Aradashan:''' Ah, Nara {{Traveler}}, want to try fighting the Bulky Iron Chunk in your dreams?
:'''Aradashan:''' We need to lift the Ararakalari we cast on the Bulky Iron Chunk, layer by layer, and finally, fight it with all Ararakalari lifted...
:'''Aradashan:''' Aradashan will not help you suppress the power of the Bulky Iron Chunk this time. But don't worry, Arasata, Arayuta, and Arasaha will still help. Want to try?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Aradashan:''' Then let's get started!
:{{DIcon}} I'll need to make some preparations.
::'''Aradashan:''' Ah, tell Aradashan when you are ready, Nara {{Traveler}}...
