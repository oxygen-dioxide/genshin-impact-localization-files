==Trivia==
* The original duration of this Event Wish was 2022/04/19 - 2022/05/10, but due to the delay of [[Version 2.7]], its end date on the Wish interface was changed to say that the event was ending in 240 days before being changed promptly to say that the banner was ending "Before Version 2.6 ends".<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/4592260 "Zephyr of the Violet Garden" Version 2.6 Events Preview - Phase III]</ref> This was not changed on the trial run event page. Its end date was changed to 2022/05/31.<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/4849613 Version 2.7 Update Notice]</ref>
