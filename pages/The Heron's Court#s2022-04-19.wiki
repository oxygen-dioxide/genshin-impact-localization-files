During this event wish, the event-exclusive 5-star character "Frostflake Heron" [[Kamisato Ayaka]] ({{Cryo}}) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

During this event wish, the 4-star characters "Wolf Boy" [[Razor]] ({{Electro}}), "Thorny Benevolence" [[Rosaria]] ({{Cryo}}), and "Mujina Ninja" [[Sayu]] ({{Anemo}}) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!

Of the above characters, the event-exclusive character will not be available in the standard wish "[[Wanderlust Invocation]]."

This is for "Character Event Wish." The wish guarantee count for "Character Event Wish" and "Character Event Wish-2" is shared, and is accumulated between both "Character Event Wish" and "Character Event Wish-2." This wish guarantee count is independent of the guarantee counts of other types of wishes.

For information about rates, see [[Wishes]].
