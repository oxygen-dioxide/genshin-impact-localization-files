;(Enter Sumeru City)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We didn't miss the Sabzeruz Festival, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's hurry and find Dunyarzad. Paimon thinks... she must be around the [[Grand Bazaar]], since she showed us around there last time.

;(Approach Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There she is! Dunyarzad, we're back!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Just as promised, Traveler and Paimon! I'm so glad that you two came back to celebrate [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s birthday.
:{{DIcon}} Looks like we made it back in time.
:{{DIcon}} It's a very important festival, after all.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe, indeed! The festival is tomorrow. We have been preparing for so long that I can't help but feel a little nervous.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's no need to be nervous! Paimon's sure that Lesser Lord Kusanali will feel everyone's gratitude.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe, thanks, Paimon. I hope that everyone who comes to the festival will also have a good time.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Speaking of which, did you manage to make your way to [[Port Ormos]]? Discover anything over there?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course we went! A lot of things happened there...
:{{DIcon}} Unfortunately, we didn't find any new information on Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:{{DIcon}} Instead, we were only left with more questions...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' *sigh* I see. Sounds like you two had another exciting adventure...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' ...If there is another chance, I would love to join...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' *sigh* My lady, if you went to Port Ormos in your current state, we'd both be in for a lifetime of trouble.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Dehya]]! You were eavesdropping!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Ahem, it's called covert protection! Keeping an ear out for what's going on around my employer is part of the job.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' It's alright, Dehya. I merely said that I "would" like to go. I know better than to think my body could handle it, hehe.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 08.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' The festival is tomorrow. I've been doing nothing but causing trouble for you, so Dehya, please take some time to relax. I'll be fine.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...Hm, even when you put it that way, it still doesn't feel right...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 09.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Don't worry, my guardian knight.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Okay, fine, but only tonight. Tomorrow's a big day, and many no-good scumbags are gonna take advantage of that.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn*
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 10.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Oh, you two must be exhausted from your long journey back to the city. My apologies for not realizing this sooner.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 dunyarzad 11.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I've already prepared a room for you to rest. Please follow me.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you're so thoughtful! Paimon's so ready!
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Here we are. It's also fairly close to where I've been staying.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks really nice!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for the trouble, Dunyarzad.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe, not at all. Just tell me more about your adventures when you next get the chance.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's Paimon's specialty! Paimon can tell you stories next time!
:{{DIcon}} About our plans for tomorrow...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Oh, if you don't mind, how about we all walk around together tomorrow?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' All of my friends will be working the festival, and Dehya is still insisting on her "covert" protection...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah? It'll be pretty hard to relax and enjoy the festival if Dehya's constantly hovering over you, right?
:{{DIcon}} I'll keep you company tomorrow.
:{{DIcon}} It'll be easier to get information with your help.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Then let's meet at the nearby bazaar first thing tomorrow morning. Have a great night!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a deal! Good night, Dunyarzad!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 dunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I may be too excited to fall asleep tonight. See you tomorrow.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's starting to really look forward to the Sabzeruz Festival, too! Will there be lots of yummy food?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, no... Thinking about food is just gonna keep Paimon up all night. The earlier we sleep, the better. Let's go inside, Traveler.
;(A scene transition occurs)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn* Did we oversleep...?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should go meet Dunyarzad right away.

;(Approach Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Traveler, Paimon! I've been waiting for you two.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good morning, Dunyarzad! We must've overslept a little bit, hehe.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Not at all. I arrived early.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Phew... Today is finally here! I must cherish every moment as if it were gold.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've worked so hard for this day. You gotta enjoy it to the fullest!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe, you know it! It's just that... as expected, I had some trouble falling asleep last night. I'm hoping my body won't be too much of an issue today.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 5 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Well, shall we? Let's start with the stalls over there.
----
;(Follow Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 6 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Many vendors came out of the blue to support the event, and they insisted on covering costs themselves. Let's go give them some business.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They paid for everything out-of-pocket? Sounds like they're not in this just for the Mora.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 6 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe, they all said that contributing to a lively festival atmosphere is more important than money, especially since we don't often get to celebrate Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, they're selling food over that way! Let's go take a look!

;(Approach Amal's stall)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' This is... a stall offering foods from the Haft-Mewa Feast.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 amal 01.ogg}} '''Amal:''' Oh-ho, you could tell straight away! I thought most people nowadays wouldn't know.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mushrooms, flowers, and all kinds of fruit... It's all vegetarian stuff. Paimon's a little disappointed...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what's the "Haft-Mewa Feast" you mentioned just now?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' It's another Sabzeruz Festival tradition. People used to set their tables with seven different foods...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Generally speaking, the most common selections were foods like [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]], [[Nilotpala Lotus]]es, [[Sumeru Rose]]s, [[Sunsettia]]s, [[Kalpalata Lotus|Kalpalatas]], [[Harra Fruit]]s, and [[Zaytun Peach]]es.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the Sabzeruz Festival is a vegetarian holiday...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe... You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy the spread. We just use the seven foods to symbolize the seven virtues of the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but if that's the case... If Sumeru uses vegetarian food to represent the Dendro Archon...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then wouldn't the Pyro Archon's festival be full of food like roasted fowl, juicy meatballs, grilled steak...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Traveler, we have to go to [[Natlan]] as soon as possible!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hahaha... I hope your wish comes true one day, Paimon.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks! Alright, how about we also check out some of these other stalls?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 01.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Dear customers, would you like to try your hand at alchemical divination?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's alchemical divination? Those two things sound like they'd be fun to try together.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 02.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Right? I thought the same when I first heard about it. It is said to be a mysterious craft invented by none other than Lesser Lord Kusanali herself.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... how does it work?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 03.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' It's quite simple. After you give me any two alchemical reagents, I'll use them to perform a random transmutation.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure sounds random... So random that it'll probably fail.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 04.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' That is precisely what we need. After the transmutation fails, your one and only diviner here will interpret the remnants.
:{{DIcon}} For some reason... I don't buy it.
:{{DIcon}} This entire thing is way too random.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Well... According to Lesser Lord Kusanali, everything is interconnected, and all that occurs can be traced back to fate. You can say this is a pearl of old wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why does everything sound so much more credible when Dunyarzad says it? Are you guys working together?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 05.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' So that's the true wisdom behind it! This young lady sure knows her stuff. So, how about it? Want to give it a try?
:{{DIcon}} Alright, I guess I can give it a go.
:;(Opens item menu)
:;(If the player exits out of the item menu and talks to Kimiya again)
:::{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 06.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' So, how about it? Want to give it a try?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 07.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Okay, one moment... Hmm... It's the Moon.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to take a look too... Is it...? It looks more like a pie that Paimon bit into.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 08.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Hmm... Generally speaking, the Moon signifies... It means... Wait a moment...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is he really looking it up in a book...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 09.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Oh, I remember now. It means illusions and lies.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Illusions and lies...? That sounds rather ominous...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 10.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Yes, but this book says that if you trust your intuition and overcome your fears, the sun will surely rise.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's not even trying to hide his book anymore.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 dunyarzad 08.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' ...Naturally, fate will only ever show you the beginning of a journey. It is up to you to forge your own ending. Hehe, thank you so much. I'll keep that in mind.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 kimiya 11.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Oh, it's nothing. I'm just learning as I go, haha... ha...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 7 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess that was still pretty interesting. Okay, on to the next stall.

;(Talk to Kimiya again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq008 kimiya 01.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' The diviner's interpretation is the most important part of alchemical divination. I just consulted the book to make sure you got the correct message.

;(Talk to Amal again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq008 amal 01.ogg}} '''Amal:''' I picked all of these from the forest yesterday, so their freshness is guaranteed!

;(Continue following Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' They say the Sabzeruz Festival was very lively a long, long time ago.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Large flower carriages used to parade through the city. As they headed towards Port Ormos, people would throw flowers, candy, and liquor all along the way...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dunyarzad's eyes are sparkling right now!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' *sigh* I wish I could have seen that spectacle. But if you ask me, I'm sure [[Nilou]]'s Dance of Sabzeruz will be just as impressive!

;(Approach Vihar's stall)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 children 01.ogg}} '''Children:''' [[Farris]]! Farris!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 01.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Atten-tion! Soldiers, fall into formation if you want any Yalda Candies!
;(The children immediately fall into formation with their hands held out, startling Vihar)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a weird guy with a weird hat.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 children 02.ogg}} '''Children:''' Hey, it's Dunyarzad!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 02.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Hahaha... Miss Dunyarzad, the children love you even more than Yalda Candies.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 03.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' In the few short days it took to prepare for the Sabzeruz Festival, the children have all grown very fond of you.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Uh... Ah, hallowed Knight of Flowers, it is an honor that you know my name!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 04.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' A&mdash;Ah, ahem... Atten-tion! In the name of Farris, the Knight of Flowers, I commend you on your contributions to the glorious Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 05.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Alright, little soldiers, take your Yalda Candies and don't forget your loyalty to Lesser Lord Kusanali. Dismissed!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 children 03.ogg}} '''Children:''' Yes, Knight Farris!
;(Two of the three children leave)
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Just what is going on here...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe. Farris, the Knight of Flowers, is another Sabzeruz Festival icon, and one immensely popular with children. In the past, the actor portraying Farris would also sit on a flower carriage.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 06.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' It's all thanks to Miss Dunyarzad's sponsorship that the children can make such wonderful memories today.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' As are we to you, [[Vihar]].
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 07.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Not at all! Oh, speaking of tradition, do you want some Yalda Candies? They're a festival staple, and I happen to have some boxes readied here. Take a look and pick whichever one you want.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whichever one... Don't these boxes all look the same?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 08.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Haha, this is the fun part. Each box contains a random flavor &mdash; it's up to the luck of the draw. Flavors include [[Lavender Melon]], Harra Fruit, Sunsettia...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, those all sound pretty good...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 vihar 09.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' ...And there's also [[Lizard Tail]] and [[Onikabuto]].
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? What's up with those two flavors?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Onikabuto is a little spicier than Lizard Tail.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dunyarzad, y&mdash;you tried them before! Hmm... Traveler, help Paimon pick one. Paimon wants the Sunsettia flavor!
:{{DIcon}} I doubt I'll be able to get the exact flavor you want...
:{{DIcon}} Don't blame me if I choose the wrong one.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's alright, Paimon believes in you!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 8 dunyarzad 08.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe, I also believe in your intuition.

:{{DIcon}} Not a problem.
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 9 badis 04.ogg}} '''Badis:''' You're... Dehya!? Dehya the Flame-Mane... No wonder we mercs haven't heard anything about you for so long. You sold your unruly mane to the highest bidder.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 9 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Don't speak so disrespectfully. My family started working with her as gratitude for her past kindness to us...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 9 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Don't worry about it, my lady. Just some friendly banter between mercs. One punch and those rabid dogs will expose themselves for what they really are.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 9 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Traveler, take Miss Dunyarzad to a safe location.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, we're gonna stay and help. There's too many of them!
:{{DIcon}} We can't guarantee anyone's safety here.
:{{DIcon}} Dehya's top priority is her employer's safety.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 10 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Uh... About that... Well... I sold it 'cause I was low on Mora. Stuff like this happens every now and then.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 10 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' It can't be... The anonymous donation that was used for the venue's final round of preparations...

:{{DIcon}} Dehya's expression just now, when she mentioned your condition...
:{{DIcon}} Just how serious is your illness?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' ...I didn't realize you were concerned about it. I guess I shouldn't continue to keep it a secret.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I was actually... born with [[Eleazar]]. It's terminal now.
:{{DIcon}} Eleazar!

:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Oh? You've already heard of Eleazar. In that case, you probably know about its severity.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' There's no need to be sad. I've always lived with Eleazar, and I came to terms with it a long time ago.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 08.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Compared to the simple fact that I am afflicted with this, its effects on my life have been much more painful.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 09.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I know that my family loves me dearly. They've done all they can to provide the best environment for me, so that I can live for that much longer. However, I know... I will one day succumb to this.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 10.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Did you know? Before I ran away from home this time... the world outside of my home didn't even know that I existed.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 11.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Since I was a child, all I could do was sit on my bed and stare at everything outside of my window.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 14.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Not to mention the incredible time spent preparing for the festival, the joy on everyone's faces here, and all the support I've received from friends like Dehya...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 15.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' This way, when my final day does arrive, it will be less sorrowful.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 16.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' At the very least, many people will remember that I once existed in this world, right?
:{{DIcon}} Yes. I will remember you.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 17.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe... Thank you two so much. I apologize for the depressing conversation. This is... This is out-of-character for me.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 18.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' To be honest, Lesser Lord Kusanali gave me the courage to do all of this. If it weren't for her encouragement, I wouldn't have taken that first step.
:{{DIcon}} You're the one who has remained resolute in the face of your illness.
:{{DIcon}} You're already so strong for never giving up.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 19.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' ...Thanks. There will always be frustrations in life, but I know that the point of living is not to leave behind any regrets.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 21.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Isn't the Dance of Sabzeruz about to begin? It's the part of the festival that I've been looking forward to the most...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 22.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Nilou will recreate that legendary scene with her most splendid dancing, and the Sabzeruz Festival will conclude amid everyone's applause and blessings...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 dunyarzad 23.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' And with that, my wish will also...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then what are we waiting for? Let's go to the stage!

:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' But the Dance of Sabzeruz is one of the key parts of the Sabzeruz Festival. If we can't perform it...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 setare 02.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' The Sabzeruz Festival... The law also prohibits the private hosting of large-scale, religious festivals. Only the Akademiya can host such an event.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 setare 03.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' If you continue to resist, we will have to order an investigation into every single event organizer...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 setare 04.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' The Grand Sage has already granted you much leniency. I advise that you exercise tact.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' How... How did things turn out like this...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' The Akademiya was originally responsible for the Sabzeruz Festival, but they've failed this responsibility for many years. I need to speak with them...
:{{DIcon}} Don't go. They have the final say in all of this.
:{{DIcon}} If we force their hand too much, the situation may get ugly.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' ...This is a hard pill to swallow, but... sigh, you're right. Things would only get worse.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 azar 01.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Art... Dance... Aren't you ashamed of pursuing such frivolous and meaningless activities in this land of knowledge and reason?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 azar 02.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Our Archon created the utopia that is Sumeru City for all scholars who sought validity, verity, and truth... while people like you wish to defile it.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' No, I believe that our Archon never rejected the arts. Even the Goddess of Flowers dedicated a dance to her...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 azar 03.ogg}} '''Azar:''' With your lack of intellectual credentials, I do not believe you are qualified to debate with me. What you should be doing is finding workers to tear down this ridiculous eyesore.

:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 azar 04.ogg}} '''Azar:''' When we return, have the [[Alhaitham|Scribe]] draft an ordinance before the next [[Jnagarbha Day]] that prohibits public art performances. We will announce it to the public later via the [[Akasha]].

:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, Dunyarzad. You all saw that just now...? The Grand Sage ordered us to stop the performance...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Yeah...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Let's go somewhere the Akademiya can't find us and perform there... Ahh, but how do we let everyone know... And what about the atmosphere and the stage...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Or we could get people to block them off so they can't interrupt the performance... Agh... No, they just threatened to investigate the organizers. If we were caught...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Nilou, it's alright. Don't worry about it.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' But you've been looking forward to the Dance of Sabzeruz so much, and I know how important this festival is to you. I don't want you to have any regrets...

:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' It would be too risky to continue the Sabzeruz Festival at this point. I don't want to get everyone in trouble...
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' ...If you say so, but... You can sneak out for the next Sabzeruz Festival, right? We'll make sure the next one is a smashing success!

:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 09.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' ...Yes! Okay, it's a promise! It WILL be a smashing success!
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can't believe this is how things turned out. Those heartless geezers...
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything else we can do?
:{{DIcon}} Should we try to think of another way?
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 10.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' It really is okay. There's nothing we can do about it.
:{{A|vo xmaq008 12 dunyarzad 11.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' *sigh* Still... I'd be lying if I said I had no regrets. I would have loved to see Nilou's dance.
