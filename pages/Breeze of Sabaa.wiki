'''Breeze of Sabaa''' is a 4-Star [[Character Outfit]] for [[Nilou]]. It is purchasable from the [[Character Outfit Shop]].

During [[Version 4.8]], Breeze of Sabaa was available at a [[Breeze of Sabaa Discount|limited-time discount]] of {{Item|Genesis Crystal|30|x=1,350}}. In [[Version 5.0]], its cost was increased to {{Item|Genesis Crystal|30|x=1,680}}.

==Appearance==
Nilou's hair is tied at the back into twin curls. She sports a white veil with a gold laurel wreath and a heart-shaped tassel, with lavender flowers and other ornaments that adorn her head in various spots.

Nilou's attire is mostly white, blue, and lavender, adorned with flowers and with various butterfly-shaped designs. She has detached sleeves tied by ribbons at her shoulders and wrists, a top adorned with various blue gems in the front and back, and a skirt that resembles flower petals. A trinket which has a lotus flower shape surrounds her right thigh, while white leg garments go from her mid-shin to her ankle, which are connected to toe rings around her second toes; she is otherwise barefoot. Ribbons cover various parts of her outfit and are attached to various ornaments, including a bow that holds her {{Hydro}} [[Vision]].

==Description==
Legend has it that the magnificence of [[Simulanka]] was spun with "words," and that mystical magical powers might be possessed by any.<br><!--
-->Yet the fate proclaimed by the goddess was thus: A day would come when the Fairy of the [[Forest of Blessings]] would descend, bearing the great burden of saving the paper residents.<br><!--
-->When Nilou was traversing the wondrous dreamscape of this fairytale world she had come to visit, she saw that the origami inhabitants were beset by a crisis, and in great turmoil.<br><!--
-->A mysterious illness had spread among them, causing them to gradually lose their memories and sense of self, and their vibrant forest home was on the verge of turning into a lifeless grey wasteland.<br><!--
-->The moment Nilou appeared, radiant with light, she became a symbol of hope and the focus of many eager eyes.<br><!--
-->It was beyond her power to give them what they wanted right away, yet fortunately, she did not shrink from this heavy burden.<br><!--
-->Just as in the beginning of countless stories, a perfectly ordinary protagonist must meet new friends in an unfamiliar land, gradually adapting themselves to the unique situation they find themselves in.<br><!--
-->And in the same way that she prepared for the dance at the [[Sabzeruz Festival]], she began knowing nothing; but after a painstaking process of trial-and-error and meticulous memorization, she would learn the steps by heart.<br><!--
-->Nilou trusted that even if she could not yet wield the fairy's magic, she could still bring blessings and hope to the people.<br><!--
-->Whether illuminated by the bright stage lights of the [[Grand Bazaar]] or the endlessly bedazzling colors of the Forest of Blessings, she possessed a unique magic of her own.<br><!--
-->Humming away, she taught the origami residents a gentle, twisting melody. As the music floated through the air, strange feelings awakened joyful memories buried at the bottom of their hearts.<br><!--
-->Then she began to dance, as lightly as a [[Crystalfly]] flutters, dispelling their unease and dispersing the rampant panic like a floral fragrance drifting in on the east wind at dawn.<br><!--
-->Having regained their peace of mind, all were able to pass the day without wallowing in fear.<br><!--
-->This was the first time that they had slept peacefully since the crisis descended upon the forest.<br><!--
-->After returning to her little hut, Nilou sat there and began to quietly flip through the pages of her book, trying to learn more about Simulanka.<br><!--
-->According to the records, the Forest Fairy's arrival was the crucial sign, heralding that the Hero of Prophecy was finally coming to rally their companions.<br><!--
-->But Nilou did not take this to mean salvation was a given, nor did she sit still and do nothing. Instead, she kept searching for more specific knowledge to find a way to turn the prophecy into reality.<br><!--
-->Her aim was to bestow a magical blessing upon the origami inhabitants by staging a grand yet heartfelt dance, and in doing so, resolve the crisis once and for all.<br><!--
-->And just as she wished, the rest of the story played out in the mildest manner imaginable.<br><!--
-->All their waiting had not been in vain, their perseverance rewarded finally with a happy resolution.<br><!--
-->Long after leaving the dreamlike realm of Simulanka, the emotion of that time still resides within this dress; even now, as Nilou dances, the joyful fragrance of ink lingers upon every breath that she takes.<br><!--
-->Yet Nilou never wondered why she was chosen as the Forest Fairy&mdash;<br><!--
-->Perhaps her so-called blessing was this &mdash; in a future as deep and distant as the night sky where good and evil coexist, she lit up a star to show people how to find their way through the most beautiful of thoughts.<br><!--
-->If this blessing had been conceived by someone who approached every moment in life with gentle-heartedness, this star would have shined with a limited brilliance, a light that would often have failed to penetrate the complex nature of reality.<br><!--
-->Only one who was as pure as the morning dew, listening to the unsullied kindness of their inner voice, could have offered up such a sincere, effective blessing that would be accepted by the world.

==Trivia==
* Nilou would choose this outfit to perform the original Dance of Sabzeruz as a surprise for [[Nahida]]'s Sabzeruz Festival.
* Although Nilou has nearly the same bangs in Breeze of Sabaa as she does in her default outfit, [[Neither Flower Nor Mist]], her bangs in Breeze of Sabaa move with her actions, while her bangs in Neither Flower Nor Mist do not.

===Etymology===
* {{Lang|{{w|Saba (wind)|Sabaa}}|ar=الصبا|ar_rm=aṣ-Ṣabā}} is an east wind that blows in the Arabian peninsula, known for its gentle and pleasant breeze. It is used extensively as a literary motif in Arabic poetry.
