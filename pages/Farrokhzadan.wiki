The '''Farrokhzadan'''<!-- "The" is inconsistently capitalized in-game --> is a [[Sumeru]] [[Eremite]] clan, presumably descended from someone named Farrokh.<ref name="FRKZDN3">Interactible: [[Farrokhzadan Journal#Farrokhzadan Journal (III)|Farrokhzadan Journal (III)]]</ref>

==History==
Little is known about the Farrokhzadan at present. They likely all claim some kind of relation to Agha Farrokh &mdash; or whichever family he came from &mdash; and follow the orders of his daughter, [[Siman Farrokhzad]], a sage affiliated with [[Amurta]] and [[Bimarstan]].<ref>Interactible: [[Bimarstan#Medical History of Giyath Khayyam|Medical History of Giyath Khayyam]]</ref> On her orders, they have dealings with the [[Fatui]], specifically [[Il Dottore]], after successfully completing a commission to kill a Fatui traitor.<ref>Interactible: [[Farrokhzadan Journal#Farrokhzadan Journal (I)|Farrokhzadan Journal (I)]]</ref> Currently, [[Lunja]] and her men are attempting to carry out his commission of capturing the [[Aranara]].<ref name="FRKZDN3" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Starry Night Chapter}}</ref>

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*The name {{lang|{{w|Farrokh (name)|Farrokh}}|fa=فرّخ}} means "luck" or "happiness."
**{{lang|{{w|Farrokhzad}}|fa=}}, by extension, means "descendant of Farrokh" or "born with luck and happiness."
*"{{w|Agha (title)|Agha}}" is not a given name, but rather a title of Turkic origin meaning "chief" or "master." It was used in the Ottoman Empire as a title for leaders of organizations and was usually appended to the end of a person's name.
**Agha Farrokh's name in the original Chinese text is {{zh|法罗赫老爹|lit=Farrokh Sir}}, with his honorific "Sir" (Agha) at the end of his name. Due to English honorific order, the English localization placed "Agha" before his name.
