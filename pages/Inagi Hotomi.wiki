==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Hello, Traveler from afar. Welcome to the Grand Narukami Shrine!
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' If you encounter any trouble or just want to make a wish, feel free to come here for a [[Fortune Slip|fortune slip]]. May the [[Electro Archon]] bless you.
:{{DIcon}} About [[Gendou Ringo]]...
:;(After completing [[The Very Special Fortune Slip]])
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Ah yes. I do believe that people have been saying that her attitude's gotten a lot better recently.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Although rather than calling it an attitude adjustment, it might be more accurate to say that "she seems like a [[Lyudochka Snezhevna|different person]]," no?
::{{DIcon}} ...
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Haha. Not to worry, everyone at the shrine already knew, more or less.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Although I'm not privy to the details, if [[Lady Yae]] has allowed her to stay at the shrine, then she is someone we can trust.
:{{DIcon}} About the Cleansing Ritual...
:;(After completing [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]])
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Lady Yae did ask us to make some arrangements for the [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] earlier.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Later, she said that new developments had precluded the need for us to continue our preparations. She even asked me to give the [[Memento Lens]] to a blond-haired outlander.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' I never expected that the "new development" that Lady Yae mentioned was you.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' You have my thanks. I do not know how you managed it, but healing the [[Sacred Sakura]] was no mean feat. You have my utmost thanks as a shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Could you tell me about [[Hanachirusato]]...
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Hanachirusato? I don't believe that any such person works at the Grand Narukami Shrine...
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Speaking of which, we found an antique kitsune mask while cleaning up the shrine hall. It seems to have once belonged to Lady [[Kitsune Saiguu]].
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' If you don't mind, would you like to have it? Since you were the one who completed the Cleansing Ritual, I believe there must be some fate that ties you, Lady Saiguu, and the shrine together.
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' It's become a little fragile with its great age, so you can't really wear it, but I believe it must at least bear some sentiments and blessings from bygone years.
::;(Obtain {{Item|A Mask}})
:{{DIcon}} About drawing fortune slips...
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Locals who want to make wishes often come here for fortune slips to seek the protection of our Archon.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Although you are a Traveler from the outside world, you will still be blessed if you believe in her.
::{{DIcon}} Everyone's wishes, huh...
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Yes... I've been in charge of greeting the people coming here for fortune slips for a while now, and I have heard all sorts of wishes from all manner of people.
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Many who came here recently wished for the [[Sakoku Decree]] to be lifted soon...
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' The Electro Archon... Hm, never mind.
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' As a shrine maiden, I should always follow and serve the [[Electro Archon]]. My life for the Eternal Narukami.
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Yes... I've been in charge of greeting the people coming here for fortune slips for a while now, and I have heard all sorts of wishes from all manner of people.
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Many have come lately to thank the Electro Archon for abolishing the country's closing, and to pray for a flourishing business or safe travels.
:::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' As a shrine maiden, I should always follow and serve the [[Electro Archon]]. My life for the Eternal Narukami.
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me more about the Grand Narukami Shrine?
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' The Grand Narukami Shrine is a place for making offerings and performing ceremonial affairs. Everything here is done according to the will of Her Excellency the Electro Archon.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Lady Yae Miko is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine. She is in charge of everything here.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' But Lady Yae is very busy indeed, and she is also the boss of [[Yae Publishing House]]. So when she is not around, I will take over some of her work.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' If you need any help from the shrine, feel free to ask me.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Inagi Hotomi:''' May the Electro Archon protect you! Take care.

==Trivia==
