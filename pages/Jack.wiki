==Profile==
Jack is a novice member of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild and a former member of [[Bennett]]'s Adventure Team before leaving due to Bennett's contagious bad luck. While his family does not support his choice of becoming an adventurer, he tries his best and finds every opportunity to prove himself.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The South Wind Brings Adventure}}</ref> He greatly idolizes [[Cyrus]] and [[Stanley]], taking their tall tales to heart.<ref name="Best Adventurer">{{Ref/Quest|The Best Audience in All of Mondstadt}}</ref>

===Personality===
Jack is rather gullible and literal-minded with a naïve outlook on how adventurers live. He gained his reputation as one of the "[[Four Drunkards]]" because he took tales of Mondstadt adventurers drinking "half of Cider Lake's worth of wine" literally and wanted to emulate them.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Jack|note=Nighttime}}</ref> He even comes up with excuses to explain the discrepancies between Cyrus' drunken tales of heroic exploits and daring adventures even if the [[Traveler]] finds evidence of exaggerations to the story.<ref name="Best Adventurer" /> Similarly, he wholeheartedly believes that [[Stanley|Hans Archibald]] is the real [[Real Stanley|Stanley]] and that the weapons Hans used during his adventures in the [[Mare Jivari]] were the "Lionfang's Legacy". [[Venti]] was also able to easily persuade him to believe that the "Lionfang's Legacy", worthless ordinary items found in Hilichurl camps, were truly [[Vennessa]]'s former gear.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lionfang's Legacy}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Jack has short brown hair and green eyes. He carries a beige rucksack filled with leeks. Onion and garlic bulbs hangs by a rope tied to the side of the bag. He wears the standard male uniform of the Adventurers' Guild. The uniform consists of two layers of shirt (a long-sleeve white shirt with mandarin collar and a green laced up vest), a green dixie cap with a red cross on the left, green vambraces, a red necktie, a green cape collar with a ruffled trim and a triangular back flap, a buckled belt, knee-length green pants with red accents, brown stockings and laced leather shoes. The Adventurers' Guild logo, an eight-pointed star, is printed on the right and back flaps of the collar.

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jack:''' Hey! Are you a new adventurer? Wanna join my adventure team?
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing ???)
::'''Jack:''' To tell the truth, I was worried at first. But I was also excited.
::'''Jack:''' This was my first time seeing a dragon. Just thinking that I might be able to face such a fearsome opponent gets me pumped up!
::'''Jack:''' If I could finish a commission of that rank, I would definitely rise to prominence throughout the entire Adventurers' Guild.
::'''Jack:''' *sigh* But as it stands, I can only take some commissions to clear out a few slimes here and there. I'm going to have a work a lot harder if I'm to take a dragon on...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself.
::'''Jack:''' I'm Jack. Just Jack. No need to be formal with me, since we're all friends here.
::'''Jack:''' I joined a few months ago, and people here helped me out lots.
::'''Jack:''' Especially those stories! Oh, they are so exciting and always get me pumped up!
::'''Jack:''' Hahaha... So far, I've only completed small commissions like clearing the sewers of a few slimes...
::'''Jack:''' *sighs* When can I be like the others...
:{{DIcon}} Adventure team?
::'''Jack:''' Yeah, people here usually band together in groups of four to go on adventures.
::'''Jack:''' You seem to be in good company.
::'''Jack:''' I once belonged to a rather nice brigade... But "Unlucky [[Bennett]]" was also there...
::'''Jack:''' We all thought it was just a joke about him being "unlucky," but...
::'''Jack:''' All the commissions he took on, somehow always failed in the least expected way...
::'''Jack:''' Come to think of it, it is rather strange.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Jack:''' Ad astra abyssosque! May Lady Luck smiles upon you, friend.
{{Dialogue end}}

=== Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jack:''' Hey, I'm doing some adventurer's training... alcohol tolerance training, to be precise... Wanna join me?
:{{DIcon}} You seem to have had one too many.
::'''Jack:''' Really? Let me see... eight beers, five wines, seven ciders... Not so much!
::'''Jack:''' I'm no match for those legendary Mondstadt adventurers who can drink half of Cider Lake's worth of wine.
::'''Jack:''' ...Only a figure of speech? Really? No wonder... I could never figure out how they could afford so much wine on an adventurer's income...
:{{DIcon}} What kind of liquor do you prefer?
::'''Jack:''' Me...? Beer. I don't like it that much though...
::'''Jack:''' It's just that... beggars can't be choosers...
::'''Jack:''' As long as it gets me drunk, it's all good... Don't you agree?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Jack:''' Laters! Happy adventuring!
