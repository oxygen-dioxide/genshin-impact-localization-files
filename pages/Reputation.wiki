'''Reputation''', also known as '''City Reputation''', is a progression system tied to each [[Teyvat#Nations|nation]]. Reputation can be obtained from completing bounties, requests, world exploration, and [[quests]]. Rewards include [[Recipe]]s, [[Forging Blueprint]]s, [[Instructions|Crafting Blueprint]]s, [[Namecard]]s, and [[Wind Glider]]s.

Unlocking the Reputation system in each nation requires [[Adventure Rank]] 25 and completing the following quests:

When the maximum Reputation Level has been reached for a city, no more Reputation EXP can be obtained, and the Reputation Quests [[Bounties]] and [[Requests]] cannot be completed.

==Reputation EXP Sources==
===Weekly Bounties===
{{Main|Bounties}}
Bounties are unlocked upon reaching Reputation Level 2. For [[Tribe Reputation|Natlan]]'s case, they are unlocked upon reaching Reputation Level 1. They can be completed by accepting a bounty from the Reputation NPC, going to the specified location(s), using [[Elemental Sight]] to find the enemy, defeating the enemy, and claiming the bounty reward from the Reputation NPC.

A total of 3 bounties can be completed each week, this limit is shared between nations. It should be noted that the bounties available reset after completing one so the highest bounty can be completed 3 times.

===Weekly Requests===
{{Main|Request}}
Requests are unlocked upon reaching Reputation Level 2. They can be completed by accepting a quest from the Reputation NPC. After accepting a request, they are treated as [[World Quest]]s and can be navigated to from the Quests menu. Requests are completed by submitting the requested item(s) to [[NPC]]s that put out the Requests or defeating the requested enemy camp.

A total of 3 requests across all nations (including Natlan) can be completed each week. Each request rewards 40 Reputation points and 20,000 [[Mora]].

*[[Request#Liyue|Liyue Requests]]
*[[Request#Inazuma|Inazuma Requests]]
*[[Request#Sumeru|Sumeru Requests]]
*[[Request#Fontaine|Fontaine Requests]]

===Supply Notice===
{{Main|Supply Notice}}
Supply Notices are unlocked upon reaching Reputation Level 1. They can be completed by donating certain [[item]]s. 

A total of 3 supply notices across [[Natlan]] can be completed each week, shared between all the tribes. Each notice rewards 80 Reputation points for the affiliated Tribe and {{Item|Sanctifying Unction|x=2}}.

===World Exploration===
World Exploration is progressed by solving puzzles, opening [[Chests]], wooden crate, and making offerings to [[Statue of The Seven|Statues of The Seven]].
