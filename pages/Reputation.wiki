'''Reputation''' (aka '''City Reputation''') is a progression system tied to each [[Teyvat#Nations|nation]]. Reputation can be obtained from completing bounties, requests, world exploration, and [[quests]]. Rewards include [[Recipe]]s, [[Forging Blueprint]]s, [[Crafting Blueprint]]s, [[Namecard]]s, and [[Wind Glider]]s. Unlike the [[Frostbearing Tree]], Reputation tasks can still be done even when Reputation has been maxed.

Unlocking the Reputation system in each nation requires [[Adventure Rank]] 25 and completing the following quests:

|[[Mondstadt]]
|{{Quest|The Outlander Who Caught the Wind}}

|[[Madarame Hyakubei]]

|[[Effendi]]
|}

When the maximum Reputation Level has been reached for a city, no more Reputation EXP can be obtained. [[Bounties]] and [[Requests]] can still be completed to obtain [[Mora]] and complete [[Battle Pass]] missions.

==Reputation EXP Sources==
===Weekly Bounties===
{{Main|Bounties}}
Bounties are unlocked upon reaching Reputation Level 2. They can be completed by accepting a bounty from the Reputation NPC, going to the specified location(s), using [[Elemental Sight]] to find the enemy, defeating the enemy, and claiming the bounty reward from the Reputation NPC.

A total of 3 bounties can be completed each week, this limit is shared between nations. It should be noted that the bounties available reset after completing one so the highest bounty can be completed 3 times.

===Weekly Requests===
{{Main|Request}}
Requests are unlocked upon reaching Reputation Level 2. They can be completed by accepting a quest from the Reputation NPC. After accepting a request, they are treated as [[World Quest]]s and can be navigated to from the Quests menu. Requests are completed by submitting the requested item(s) to [[NPC]]s that put out the Requests or defeating the requested enemy camp.

A total of 3 requests across all nations can be completed each week. Each request rewards 40 Reputation points and 20,000 [[Mora]].

| '''Reputation'''<br />Due to certain circumstances, the [[Knights of Favonius]] are presently short-handed.<br />Whether it be hunting monsters, or completing the endless stream of requests from the citizenry... The tasks that still need doing have long begun to pile up.<br />At the same time, their manpower shortage has led to a surplus of supplies.<br />If you listen to and complete the requests of the citizens of Mondstadt, and defeat the monsters that endanger them, you may earn the gratitude of [[Hertha]], Captain of the Knights' 6th Company, and the trust of Mondstadt's people...<br /><br />'''Requests'''<br />Listening and responding to the people's please is the duty of the Knights of Favonius.<br />Without enough people to do the job, however, the Knights are currently placing heavy emphasis on the "listening" part.<br />Accepting Requests from Hertha and completing them will increase your Reputation.

| '''Reputation'''<br />"Where merchants flock, and all ships dock, and to all four corners flows our stock."<br />But it is that very intricacy of terrain that allows many monsters to hide from the [[Millelith]], and the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] also lacks the time to listen to all the peoples' requests.<br />If you can complete the requests from Liyue's people and destroy these dangerous monsters, you may yet earn the favor of [[Ms. Yu]] from the Ministry, and the trust of Liyue.<br /><br />'''Requests'''<br />Fulfilling the people's requests is the duty of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.<br />Without enough people to do the job, however, the Ministry and their subordinate Millelith are sometimes forced to send willing but inexperienced hands into the fray.<br />Accepting Requests from Ms. Yu and completing them will increase your Reputation.

| '''Reputation'''<br />Owing to the nature of its duties, the [[Yashiro Commission]] is uniquely in touch with the joys and woes of the common folk, and thanks to the temperament of the lady of the house, the Yashiro Commission is always willing to help people with whatever is troubling them.<br />Be it monsters, bandits, or citizens' requests, the Yashiro Commission will always lend a helping hand.<br />However, for [[Madarame Hyakubei|Madarame]], who has been tasked with organizing this facet of their work, it is far too great a task for one person to take on alone.<br />Perhaps by listening to the wishes of Inazuma's people, completing their commissions, and eliminating the monsters that threaten the land, you will earn their gratitude and the trust of the Yashiro Commission...<br /><br />'''Requests'''<br />Counting on passionate and reliable people while rewarding those willing to help with supplies is one of the Yashiro Commission's ways of helping the Inazuma locals.<br />Accepting Requests from Madarame Hyakubei and completing them will increase your Reputation.

| To administer the realm in the care of the [[Dendro Archon]], some [[Akademiya]] researchers are constantly concerned with the safety of Sumeru's citizenry and the commissions they post.<br />[[Effendi]] has been posted to the Citadel of Regzar to serve as a Liaison Officer who promotes good relations between the people, the Akademiya, and the [[Corps of Thirty]]. To this end, he searches for the best person for every job to ensure that the work will be completed as soon as possible.<br />Every once in a while, the Corps of Thirty will be otherwise occupied. Helping Effendi in a timely fashion and completing bounties and resident commissions can earn you rewards from the Akademiya and the acknowledgment of Sumeru's people...<br /><br />'''Reputation: Akademiya'''<br />Through Effendi, you can access the latest Bounties and Requests, and you can also collect Reputation EXP for World Exploration and Sumeru Quests.<br />In addition, you can also check your Reputation EXP and Level and obtain the rewards related to increasing your Reputation Level.<br /><br />'''Reputation: Levels and Rewards'''<br />When your Reputation Level goes up, you can obtain the corresponding rewards.<br />Once your Reputation has hit the maximum level, you can no longer accumulate Reputation EXP.
