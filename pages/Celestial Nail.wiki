The '''Celestial Nails'''<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Once, the Sacred Seat of Judgment}}</ref>—also referred to with a variety of terms such as '''divine nails''',<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref> '''needles''', '''pillars''', and '''spikes'''—are large objects resembling broken crystalline pillars found scattered in ancient ruins across [[Teyvat]]. These nails contain immense power and are capable of affecting the [[Ley Line]]s in the areas where they are located.<ref name="Ancient Carvings">{{Ref/HEO|Dragonspine's Glacial Secret|s=Ancient Carvings}}</ref>

According to various legends, they were cast down by [[Celestia|the heavens]] to heal the land following the [[Great War of Vengeance|war]] between the [[Heavenly Principles]] and the [[Second Who Came]], but they also devastated the mortal realm.<ref name="SotSS">{{Ref/Weapon|Staff of the Scarlet Sands|quote=In the original world, the barriers were torn down, and the dark poison had penetrated the earth. To heal that fragile, sad, and imperfect world, the spikes descended and pierced through the earth's crust.}}</ref><ref name="Amethyst Crown">{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown|quote="But the master of the heavens, consumed by fear for the rising tide of delusion and breakthroughs, sent down the divine nails to mend the land, laying waste to the mortal realm..."}}</ref>

==Overview==
All known Celestial Nails take the form of a broken pillar with a seemingly stone exterior, a blue crystalline interior revealed through its broken end, and decorative motifs around the nail. At the top of the nail is a [[Symbols in Teyvat#Celestial Motif|celestial motif]].

At [[Dragonspine]] and [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|The Chasm]], people who have undertaken research into the areas' strange environments have noted peculiarities of similar qualities, which relate back to the power of the Celestial Nails. Dragonspine, which was once a lush mountain, has blue plants that proliferate around [[Ancient Rime]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|In the Mountains}}</ref> The Chasm, which is known for its ore, began spawning [[Lumenstone]] and [[Lumenspar]] after a fragment of its Celestial Nail was discovered in one of the underground mines' caves.<ref name="Mining Records">{{Ref/HEO|Find The Chasm Mining Records|note=The Chasm Spiritstone Investigation Report}}</ref> These stones are capable of repelling [[Dark Mud]], an Abyssal power, which also began emerging en masse after the discovery of the nail fragment. According to [[Nahida]], the Celestial Nails have the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in Teyvat, such as [[forbidden knowledge]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold|quote='''Nahida:''' It has the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in Teyvat.}}</ref>

Upon impact with the ground, the nail leaves behind a large crater in its wake, as shown in the area surrounding the Chasm's [[Spiritstone]] and the depression in the center of [[Mt. Damavand]]. Celestial Nails often cause extreme weather changes in the places they land, such as Dragonspine becoming a snowy mountain, [[Tsurumi Island]] being covered in fog, and the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]] developing raging sandstorms.

==Story==
Thousands of years ago, the Heavenly Principles' war against the Second Who Came brought great destruction to heaven and earth.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Moonlit Bamboo Forest|3|quote=But this was all before the world was smashed against the tides of great calamity. With time, disasters overturned the sovereign carriage and laid ruin to the halls of the stars.}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|title=Before Sun and Moon|quote=The second throne of the heavens came, and war was rekindled, as it was in the world's creation. That day, the heavens collapsed and the earth was rent asunder.}}</ref> In the aftermath, the heavens cast down the Celestial Nails to mend the land and suppress the "dark poison" &mdash; highly implied to relate to the secrets of the skies, forbidden knowledge, and the [[Abyss]] &mdash; that the invaders had brought. However, this also had devastating effects on civilizations that still existed on the mortal realm.<ref name="SotSS" /><ref name="Amethyst Crown" />

===Dragonspine===
[[Sal Vindagnyr]], located on the mountain now known as Dragonspine, was once a lush and verdant area with a prominent [[Irminsul]] tree which the people revered. When the [[Skyfrost Nail]] descended, it landed over a ritual site at the summit of the mountain, now known as the [[Peak of Vindagnyr]].<ref>{{Ref/Domain|Peak of Vindagnyr}}</ref> It drastically transformed the area's climate and also shattered the Irminsul tree, which the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr]] attempted to revive via grafting but failed to accomplish.<ref name="Ancient Carvings" /><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Frostbearer}}</ref> For unknown reasons, the Skyfrost Nail splintered into shards which then scattered to three places around Dragonspine, one of which was the Irminsul tree &mdash; which later became the [[Frostbearing Tree]].

Around a thousand years ago, towards the end of the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]] era, a group of nobles attempted to restore their prestige by arranging an expedition to uncover Dragonspine's secrets. However, this expedition was sabotaged by [[Eberhart]], who wished to overthrow the aristocracy, and none of its members made it back to Mondstadt.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Land Entombed}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/HEO|Ragged Records}}</ref>

By the time the [[Traveler]] explores Dragonspine, nobody had yet reached the summit on account of the [[Ancient Rime]] that blocked the paths to the summit. During {{Quest|In the Mountains}}, the Traveler frees the three shards from their icy encasements, which causes them to return to the main nail fragment at the summit. After the nail is fully restored, it ascends into the sky above the Peak of Vindagnyr.

===The Chasm===
The Celestial Nail in the Chasm is known as the Spiritstone and has a connection to the [[Solar Chariot]], also known as the "heavenly star" legend to the people of [[Liyue]].<ref name="Mining Records" /> Little is revealed regarding the ancient civilization in the depths of The Chasm besides the fact that it is older than [[Khaenri'ah]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Grave of the Guarded}}</ref>

In recent times, a fragment of the Spiritstone was discovered in [[Stony Halls]], where miners who came in contact with it would begin having hallucinations in which their desires were granted, leading to this crystal to be dubbed the "Wishstone." Lumenstone and Lumenspar also began appearing en masse, while the physical structure of The Chasm's mines began changing as though it was alive. Alarmed by these turns of events, the [[Liyue Qixing]] ordered the closure of The Chasm and made an agreement with the [[Fatui]] to investigate the cause.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}</ref> Following the events of {{Quest|Chapter I}}, this agreement was annulled and the Qixing decided to lead their own investigation.

During {{Quest|The Chasm Delvers}}, the Traveler and the [[Chasm Exploration Team]] investigate the source of the anomalies in the mines. After freeing the Wishstone and following trails left behind by the Fatui [[Ninth Company]]'s investigations, the Traveler makes their way to the Spiritstone, where they find it being bound by Abyssal power. Releasing the Spiritstone caused a Khaenri'ahn [[Ruin Serpent]], Haftvad the Worm, to emerge, which was only defeated after [[Yelan]] dislodged the Spiritstone and crushed the Ruin Serpent underneath it. After Haftvad's destruction, the Spiritstone floated back up, albeit to a lower altitude than before.

During {{Quest|Perilous Trail}}, a group consisting of the Traveler, [[Paimon]], [[Arataki Itto]], [[Kuki Shinobu]], [[Yanfei]], and Yelan fall into the space underneath the Spiritstone. There, they discovered that the domain it was connected to had a mysterious property which completely annihilated the power of the Abyss, but also doomed the [[Millelith]] soldiers and the [[Yaksha]] [[Bosacius]] who had willingly sealed themselves in there to destroy the Abyssal threat during the [[cataclysm]].

===Tsurumi Island===
It is implied that the [[Thunderbird]] witnessed a Celestial Nail fall onto [[Tsurumi Island]] during their reign, which temporarily stopped the storms on the island before causing it to be enshrouded in fog.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna|quote=Once, strange objects fell from the heavens, one of which landed upon this island, after which your sky returned to its clear state. Afterward, the fog started to emerge.}}</ref> [[Sumida]] speculates the nail may have been the cause of a ley line disorder, which then mixed with the Thunderbird's power to produce the unique time-related properties of the island.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sea of Fog and the Rite of the Trees|quote='''Sumida:''' [...] I doubt that such a ley line disorder could occur naturally, so... Let's just say it fell from the skies? Maybe it was a fragment of Celestia, or something...}}</ref>

There is no visible nail on Tsurumi Island, although there is a withered Irminsul tree on [[Shirikoro Peak]], similar to the withered trees in Dragonspine, Mt. Damavand and the Chasm.

===Mt. Damavand/Eternal Oasis===
In [[Sumeru]], a Celestial Nail was responsible for its desertification.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Shadow of the Sand King}}</ref> It was used to combat the forbidden knowledge accumulated by [[Apep]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref> The nail's impact is implied to have created [[Mt. Damavand|Mount Damavand]] and its power formed a permanent tornado in its center, which is the main cause of the sandstorms around the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]]. According to legend, [[King Deshret]] found the Celestial Nail and used its power, along with the power of the [[Jinn]], to create the [[Eternal Oasis]] as a cemetery for Nabu Malikata.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Defender of the Enchanting Dream}}</ref>

Although the nail is not shown in-game, there is a withered Irminsul tree in the Eternal Oasis, similar to the withered trees in other locations. Additionally, a faint blue light resembling that of the other Celestial Nails is visible behind the sandstorm at the heart of Mount Damavand.

===Night Kingdom===
In [[Natlan]]'s [[Night Kingdom]], a Celestial Nail is visible directly above the grounds where [[Nightsoul Totem]] challenges take place. While it is unknown if this location has a physical counterpart, the [[Basin of Unnumbered Flames]] is said to have been formed as "the result of a colossal object crashing down here many years ago," and the [[mini-map]] icon in the trial grounds displays the player's location as at the center of the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. It is thus possible that the Stadium was built on the original impact site of Natlan's Celestial Nail.

===Hyperborea===
The golden city of [[Hyperborea]], located in the far north, was destroyed by a celestial nail.<ref name=Oblivion>{{Ref/Arti|Deep Gallery's Moment of Oblivion}}</ref> After this time, the city was apparently swallowed by the deep sea.<ref name=Ballad>{{Ref/Weapon|Ballad of the Fjords}}</ref> It is unclear whether this is due to a Ley Line Disorder associated with the Nail, or with the contemporaneous Great War of Vengeance, which is known to have sunk large portions of Teyvat.
