|text      = Recently, two musicians in our opera troupe retired and returned to their hometowns. Before they left, they introduced several other adept musicians to us.

These musicians are indeed talented. Despite the little time we've had to practice and rehearse, their playing is already in perfect harmony with my singing. As I listened to those melodies, so familiar yet fresh, I could sometimes see the smiling faces of the two old musicians accompanying me with their performances during my childhood days of learning opera.

Partings and encounters are a running theme throughout life, being staged again and again, bringing us sorrows and surprises, and these are but a few of the manifold flavors of life.

In this new year of my life, I wish to spend more time with my dear friends and continue to progress in my singing and acting skills. In fact, I've been feeling inspired lately and am planning to stage a new play. As it coincides with my birthday celebration, I'd really like to hear your insights on it. Please do come.
