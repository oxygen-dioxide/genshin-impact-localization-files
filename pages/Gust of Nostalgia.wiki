{{Description|A feather carried over by whimpering sea winds and crimson waves. The passage of time has changed its shape and color.}}
'''Gust of Nostalgia''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Heart of Depth]].

==Description==
A red feather is an ill omen, perhaps even a portent of death.<br />It washed ashore one day together with the corpse of a great sea creature.

The cynical [[Parsifal|Chief Mate]] was no native of [[Liyue]]. Rather, he came from [[Mondstadt|a gray land ruled by an aristocracy]].<br />All said that he, too, was once such a noble, but that he must have disgraced his house and been turned out as a result.<br />That was but baseless hearsay, however, for when he first came to the harbor, he carried naught but a [[Iron Sting|slim sword]],<br />And a small sapphire-blue feather pinned to his mantle.

Later, the wanderer would throw in with the [[Skipper]] and set out to sea, contending with great waves and sea creatures alike.<br />That once azure-blue feather would also be stained red by blood and by the salt of the great ocean.

In his last moment,<br />He clearly recalled those days now drowned in drink.<br />Like treasure in the sand brought to light by the lapping waves...
