;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo rpeq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Today's the final day of Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures! Let's go find Freminet at his camp.

;(Talk to Freminet or Thelxie)
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Freminet! Thelxie! We're here!
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Hello, Paimon. Hello, {{Traveler}}.
:'''Thelxie:''' -.. -... .-- -...?<ref group="Note" name="Ça va">{{w|Morse code}} for "DBWB." Deciphering the {{w|Caesar cipher}} using a left shift of one results in "CAVA" {{Lang|fr=''Ça va ?''|fr_tl=How are you?}}.</ref>
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is the crown ready?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yes, we're just waiting for Zuria now. She hasn't arrived yet.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then let's wait for her a little while! Or actually, maybe we can go find her? It's not too far from here, anyway. Didn't she say she just lives on the hill over there?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}! Paimon!
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, and speaking of...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 02.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Found you two at long last... I'm so glad that you're both all right.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why are you here, Miss Delaroche? And what could have happened to us?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 03.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' What could have happened? That Water Imp Thelxie, of course! After I gave you that commission the other day, I began to get worried and went asking about the boy that went missing...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that? We've got that all figured out now! The boy you heard about was just Freminet. Even the missing fish was his fault. Don't worry, we'll help you get the fish back as soon as we're done with this job!
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Sorry about that, I've been diving in the area recently...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 04.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Huh? Freminet? Diving? No no no... that's not what happened at all. I've heard a completely different account...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 05.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' What I was told is that about a month ago, a child tied a bunch of heavy seashells onto his body and walked into this open stretch of water. He never came back... what could that be, if not that Water Imp's work?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Are... Are you sure?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 06.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' One hundred percent sure! I've confirmed the account with several veteran fishermen I know. The child was only eight years old... His name was Lescot. Lescot Destree.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Wait... Lescot Destree?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 07.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Yeah, that's the name! They say the family took on the name after moving to the city from a place called Destree. Anyway, his mother is a pretty famous art dealer, while his father passed away from an accident many years ago.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 08.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' *sigh* Naturally, his mother was devastated by the incident, and fell terribly ill. It's said that she left the Court of Fontaine, and no one knows where she has gone.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It can't be... right? Lescot Destree... Zuria Destree... It must be some sort of a coincidence.
:{{DIcon}} Seems like we need to pay a visit to the Destree house.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I'm sorry, Miss! We've got to go check on something right now!
:{{A|vo rpeq003 2 delaroche 09.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Oh, I see... Well, you go on ahead. I just came to make sure that you're both all right. I'll head back then... Please remember to take care!

;(Approach Zuria Destree's house)
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Excuse us! Is anyone here? Is this Madame Destree's place?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 01.ogg}} '''A male voice from inside the room:''' Who are you? I have a patient here who needs quiet bed rest. Please leave us be unless you have anything urgent to report.
:{{DIcon}} Who is the patient?
:{{Black Screen|The door opens after a brief moment of silence. A man walks out with a confused look in his eyes...}}
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 02.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' This is the residence of Zuria Destree, and I am Jalacan, her family doctor. What did you mean by your question just now? Who else could be my patient?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your patient should be... Zuria's son, right? She told us herself that her son had contracted Loneliness Syndrome...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 03.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' No, you're right, young master Lescot did have that illness once upon a time, but he's... Well, the young master's no longer with us, and now, the Madame has come down with the same illness. Are you... her friends by any chance?
:{{Black Screen|You inform the doctor of all that's happened in the past few days between some breaks of silence...}}
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 04.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' Ah... So when she had requested time to go out over the past few days, it was so she could spend them with you.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' So, if I'm understanding this right... The one who's suffering from uncontrollable delusions is the Madame herself? She believes her son is still alive?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 05.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' That is correct. When the young master... disappeared, she was organizing an art exhibit that she had specifically prepared for him. But since she had to leave the house, she was unable to see her son one last time...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 06.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' That might have been the trigger for her regret, or perhaps the family's fall into loneliness and grief was inevitable as soon as the old master passed away. First the son, and then the mother...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But how could that be... She really looked like she had a handle on everything. Her smile was so lovely, and she even told us to stay optimistic. But you're saying, she...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 07.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' Those actions are proof that she can no longer differentiate between fantasy and reality.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then... all the other things that she told us about her son... Were those fake, too?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 08.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' No, those were all real, although they were all things that happened before the young master left us for good. Madame's time has just never moved forward since his passing.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I see, so after her son left, she created a fantasy world where her son was still with her. She was looking for a way to cure his illness when she ran into us...
:{{DIcon}} So, how is Zuria now?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 09.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' She has been in a good mood the past few days, even humming a song when she returned from her stroll. She even began discussing with me the idea of using deliberate guidance to ease the illness. It was all going well, until last night...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 10.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' ...She spent a whole night staring at the shell the young master left behind, and the words that he had inscribed onto it... Then, she broke down once more. I prescribed some sedatives, and she's currently resting.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... But then what should we do? How can we help her? There has to be something we can do...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Don't panic, Paimon... Even though this is a devastating piece of news, we must all calm down first...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (What should we do? I need to think... I need to remember the old House of the Hearth, and the children who lived in it... Those patients, and what their doctors said then... Ah! What if...)
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Dr. Jalacan, have you seen a picture book? The Madame should have brought it back with her.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 11.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' Hmm... Are you thinking about trying the guidance therapy she talked to me about before?&nbsp;...It's worth a shot. I'll go get the book.
:{{Black Screen|The doctor quickly retrieves the book and hands it to Freminet.}}
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yes... This is it.
:{{DIcon}} We still need to finish the adventure and the picture book?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' That's right. If what Dr. Jalacan said was true, the past few days have been very helpful to Zuria. So we should complete this journey.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' We need to show her that her child has found a happy ending in the world of her dreams.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... But wouldn't that just make it harder for her to accept reality?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 jalacan 12.ogg}} '''Jalacan:''' One must first face reality before accepting it. The Madame has been crushed by her feelings of grief, and can no longer bring herself to face reality. Our first priority would be to get her out of this state.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Right... Before today, I had thought she wanted to use Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures to save her son. But now, I think she might need it to save herself.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 10.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' And if we could complete it, we should be able to give her some feeling of inspiration and closure. Maybe those feelings would be enough to give her some courage to face reality again...
:{{DIcon}} We'll have to give it a try.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 3 freminet 11.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' There's no time to waste... Let's set off right away.

;(Interact with Inscribed Shell (III), optional)

:{{A|vo rpeq003 4 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Everyone... Please don't be so down and gloomy. Remember what she told us? If we were to feel troubled, the patient would become anxious as well...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, you're right, Paimon needs to smile! If we have to give something to Zuria, it should be our smiles! We have to keep smiling as we finish this adventure.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And then she'll be able to recover, right everyone?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I'm sure she will.

:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon... You're here.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Freminet! Why did you call us in such a hurry? Did you hear something from Zuria? Ohh, if it's not good news, Paimon doesn't want to hear it!
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Don't worry, it's definitely great news. The Madame came here for a visit just now with her doctor. Color has returned to her cheeks, and she sounded full of energy as well.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 10.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' She said she'd like to return to the Court to continue hosting the art exhibit, but this time, she'll work with her doctor to exhibit some picture books related to the illness.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 11.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Of course, Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures and the guidance therapy will be included in the exhibit as well. She'd like to use her experience to help others.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's wonderful! Whew, so it wasn't bad news after all.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 12.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Mhm. Here, please take this picture book with you. The Madame wanted you to have it. If, at some point in the future, you were to run into someone with similar troubles, she hopes the book would be of use to you.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? But this is her son's story, right? Is it really okay to give the book to us?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 13.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Don't worry, it's just a copy. She still has the original. It's extremely important to her.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, then there's no problem! Ahh, it feels good knowing we've contributed to something important. Paimon definitely didn't expect the fantasy adventure to be so useful... Paimon was a little worried about how everything would turn out. After all, fantasy is just fantasy.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 14.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Paimon, do you know what the Madame said?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 15.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' She said... that at the moment when she placed the crown on Thelxie's head, she felt like she really saw something beautiful. Her child had returned, and he told her that he loved her.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 16.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' She also said that was when she was finally able to bid farewell to her son. She felt like at that moment, she was healed by some mystical power, and she was filled with courage from head to toe.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh!? Really? But could that just be another part of her fantasy?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 17.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Perhaps, but if fantasy is just fantasy, and the fantasy world is not real, then how could it still grant us these powers that we can continue to use in the real world?
:{{DIcon}} So... perhaps fantasy is not just fantasy after all.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' B&mdash;But what else could it be?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 18.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' A descent of the fairytale world into the real world. At that time, the wondrous fairytale temporarily became reality, and influenced real things in our world. That has to be what happened...
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 19.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' You saw it too, didn't you?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But that can't be what happened, right? There's just no way! Wouldn't it be like a miracle if that really happened?
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 20.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yes... I suppose that would be a miracle.
:{{A|vo rpeq003 6 freminet 21.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I hope that everyone who's found themselves in a dark place would be able to see something beautiful, and experience a miracle for themselves.
