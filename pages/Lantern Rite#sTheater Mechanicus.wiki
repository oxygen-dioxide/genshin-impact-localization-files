===Requirements===
Complete the quests [[The Origin of the Lanterns]] and [[Liyue: Theater Mechanicus]].

===Summary===
*Each attempt at Theater Mechanicus costs 1 [[Xiao Lantern]] (regardless of whether or not the challenge is successful). [[Xiao Lantern]]s can be crafted at a [[Crafting]] Bench, and the required crafting materials can be obtained by gathering plants and ore, or by defeating specified [[enemies]].
*Progressing through the stages of [[Festive Fever (Lantern Rite)|Festive Fever]] unlocks new maps, new mechanics, higher upgrade levels, and increased difficulty levels.
*Progressing through the stages of Festive Fever unlocks new Theater Mechanicus challenges. Complete them to win [[Peace Talisman]]s.
*Theater Mechanicus challenges can only be completed in Single-Player Mode or a two-player [[Co-Op Mode|Co-Op]] session.

===Tutorial===
[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 1.png|200px|thumb|left]]Before challenging a Stage, you can use Veneficus Sigils to unlock new Mechanici and upgrade the ones in your possession. Each time a Mechanici is upgraded, it grows in strength. Once a certain level is reached, it can also gain additional effects. The level and type of Mechanici available within a Stage depend on how advanced your Mechanici are in the open world.
{{clr|L}}
[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2.png|200px|thumb|left]]A Stage can be challenged by up to two players at any given time. When you enter a Co-Op session of Theater Mechanicus, the max constructible Veneficus Mechanici is a collective limit that is shared between all players. Each player still accrues Veneficus Points individually. Once the challenge has started, you can spend Veneficus Points to build various kinds of Mechanici at designated bases. Earn more Veneficus Points by defeating monsters during the Stage. Some Mechanici can be rotated to adjust the area covered. Removing Mechanici refunds a portion of their cost.
{{clr|L}}
[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 3.png|200px|thumb|left]]At the beginning of each Stage and after defeating a set number of monsters, you can choose a Stage Mystic Art. Some of them will simply strengthen your Mechanici. Others, while providing even greater boosts, come with frightening side effects. Choose carefullу...
{{clr|L}}
[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 4.png|200px|thumb|left]]To achieve victory in a Stage, you must keep defeating monsters to prevent them from escaping. During the Stage, characters can neither deal DMG to opponents nor obtain Elemental Energy. Skillful utilization of the environment and the Mechanici is the key to completing the challenge. Upon completing a challenge you will be rewarded with Veneficus Sigils that can be used to empower your Mechanici.
