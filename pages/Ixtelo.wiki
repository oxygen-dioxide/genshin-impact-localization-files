==Profile==
Ixtelo was once an associate of [[Hawka]], the infamous trafficker. At some point, he entered the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] and witnessed a "boundless darkness" (likely related to the [[Abyss]]), which drove him to madness. After returning, he developed an obsession with "gems," including one that he called "Sulferite." He attempted to embed "gems" into his own eyes, believing that doing so would rid him of the fear and darkness that haunted him. This drew the disgust of Hawka and his other associate [[Soncoyoc]], who refused to keep working with him, even despite their own shady dealings.<ref>Interactable: [[Atocpan#Damaged Letter|Damaged Letter]]</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Soncoyoc}}</ref>

At some point, Ixtelo began to gouge out the eyes of strangers to replace them with "gems." A bounty was issued for these "blasphemous acts," but it is implied that he took out the hunter who pursed him.<ref>Interactable: [[Atocpan#Damaged Bounty|Damaged Bounty]]</ref> After the player defeats Ixtelo, he does not reappear.
