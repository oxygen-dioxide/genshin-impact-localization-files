You can continuously upgrade the [[Blessing Level|Blessing level]] to enhance the effects of the corresponding [[Elemental Reaction]]s. Based on the new Brilliant Blessings, the refresh mechanic of Performance Events has also been adjusted.
*#  Reduces the number of characters required for each difficulty level, and additional characters included can receive buffs:

** [[Adventure Rank]] 30 or above
** Haven't logged into the game for at least 45 consecutive days
** At least 60 days since the last time they activated "Reunion Gifts."
