==Profile==
Nelson enjoys eating cat food, and no matter how much he is fed, he will still get excited at the sight of food. The customers at the tavern forget about their drinks after seeing him. They all love him, and fight over who gets to feed him. [[Diona]] suspects that he pretends to be hungry to get taken care of by the customers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Catch a Kitten}}</ref>
