:: {{A|VO Riqueti 01.ogg}} "Grr, the Palais Mermonia's idea of crisis awareness defies words..."
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Riqueti:''' The sense of crisis people have at the [[Palais Mermonia]] is just... hard to assess.
:{{DIcon}} They do seem quite busy.
::'''Riqueti:''' And there's the rub.
::'''Riqueti:''' We should ask ourselves this honestly &mdash; if we did work at normal efficiency and with the usual workload at Maison Gestion, how much would we be able to do?
::'''Riqueti:''' I never thought about any of this when I was with the [[Special Security and Surveillance Patrol]]. Only when I grew older and transferred to the Maison Gestion did I have more and more questions.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Patrol...
::'''Riqueti:''' The Patrol's membership is highly streamlined, picking only the best of the best, regardless of any member's past.
::'''Riqueti:''' Even if they are the children of criminals and thus of ill repute, they can join the Patrol so long as they have the ability.
::'''Riqueti:''' This sounds funny, but the Patrol is the least mechanized section of the Gardes.
::'''Riqueti:''' If you asked the present Captain, [[Chevreuse]], about that, she'd say, "Gardemeks will only block our bullets!"
;(After completing {{Quest|Prelude of Blancheur and Noirceur}})
:{{DIcon}} Are you referring to the "prophecy"?
:;(Before completing [[Masquerade of the Guilty]])
::'''Riqueti:''' Ah. Are you concerned about it as well?
::'''Riqueti:''' Good. Then you've got a better nose for danger than many people here in Fontaine.
::'''Riqueti:''' There is no point discussing the veracity of such a thing, because before a crisis comes, no one can truly use accurate evidence to convince another.
::'''Riqueti:''' But if we don't consider it at all... Some might call it optimism. Others would call it folly.
:;(After completing Masquerade of the Guilty)
::'''Riqueti:''' The prophecy is the biggest crisis Fontaine has faced so far. But I have other things to worry about as well.
::'''Riqueti:''' And even today some are discussing whether the prophecy was real or not. They just can't see what's really important.
::'''Riqueti:''' We can't ignore all our other problems simply because we survived a major crisis. Assuming that life will be easy from now on is... well, it's either optimism or ignorance.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Riqueti:''' See you. Wish us all luck.
