|description = The height of summer is a wonderful time of the year, and there are always many strange, interesting events taking place.<br />A cursed blade of unknown origin, a mysterious unsolved case, and the familiar but not too familiar islands far at sea...<br />"O seasoned warriors, fear not the depths of despair and death borne from chaos!"<br />"For the Prinzessin, holiest of sovereigns of the kingdom where the night is sacred, will therefore declare the verdict of victory."<br />And so, everyone followed the path of their destiny, ready to take on unknown encounters and challenges.

* Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.8, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows
* Phase I: Valiant Moon
** When a character takes the field, they will gain 1 Fortitude stack every 2s. This will increase their ATK by 20%. Max 3 stacks. When characters with 3 Fortitude stacks hit opponents with Charged Attacks, a shockwave will be unleashed at the opponents' position, dealing True DMG. A shockwave can be unleashed in this manner once every 2s. When the character leaves the field, all their Fortitude stacks will be cleared.    
* Phase II: Windswept Moon
** When a character triggers Swirl on an opponent, that opponent's DEF is decreased by 12% for 10s. Max 3 stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently.
* Phase III: Shivered Moon
** After the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents, that character's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 12% for 8s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Max 4 stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently. This effect will be cleared if the character leaves the field.

==Adjustments & Optimizations==
;Enemies    
# Reduces the [[ATK]] of [[Nobushi: Jintouban]], [[Nobushi: Kikouban]], [[Nobushi: Hitsukeban]], [[Kairagi: Fiery Might]], [[Kairagi: Dancing Thunder]], and [[Specters]] in Worlds with a [[World Level]] of 3–6.
# Optimizes the performance of [[Rifthounds]] after being hit.
# Adjusts the performance of [[Specters]] after being hit and launched.
# Reduces Specters' [[HP]] and [[resistance to interruption]], and increases the HP Percentage to fill up the [[Fury]] meter of Specters.
# Adjusts part of the Specters' behavior logic: it can be affected by the pull effect when it is not in the "expanded" state.    

;System    
# When picking up an item drop, the icon of the drop will also show the number of its stacks if its stack is greater than 1.
# Optimizes the attribute filtering of [[Artifacts]], giving priority to displaying Artifacts whose primary attribute is the filtered attribute.
# Adds "[[Traveler]]" Character Level-Up prompts to the character screen.

;Audio    
* Adds Receiving a Gift [[voice-over]] lines for some characters in "Character > Profile."
* Optimizes the sound effects for certain character attacks.
* Optimizes the volume performance of some cutscene animations.

* Changes the "Guide" page to "Version Highlights" in the [[Paimon Menu]].
* Fixes an issue whereby buttons may conflict in the "Character Selection" interface when using a controller: in the "Character Selection" interface, the Claim Friendship Rewards button will be hidden and the corresponding function of the L3 button will be to carry out filtering.
* When using a controller, the Purchase button and purchase function of items that are not available for purchase or redemption in the Event Shop will be disabled.

==Bug Fixes==

;Enemies
# Fixes an issue with the boss "[[Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto]]" whereby the Baleful Vajras summoned would have a small probability of positioning themselves incorrectly.

;Characters
# Fixes an issue with the characters [[Xiao]] and [[Gorou]] whereby clipping would occur on their movements on the [[Characters]] > [[Talents]] interface and optimizes the streamer ribbon effects on [[Gorou]], [[Venti]], and [[Kaedehara Kazuha]]'s outfits on this same interface.
# Fixes an issue with [[Tartaglia]] whereby the Elemental Skill CD duration would be abnormal after performing certain actions if Tartaglia enters Melee Stance after using his Elemental Skill.
# Fixes an issue with [[Yelan]]'s Whitesilk Mantle that caused clipping to occur in [[Aimed Shot]] at certain angles.

# Fixes an issue whereby after reading the [[tutorial]] entries, there is a small chance of not being able to claim [[Primogem]]s. After the version update, the tutorial entries whose rewards could not be claimed will reappear with a red notification dot. Players will be able to re-read them and claim Primogems as normal.

;Other
# Fixes an issue whereby before entering [[Co-Op Mode]], if the host performed certain actions, enemies in the open world would abnormally remain in the state when the game was paused after a guest entered the world.

# Fixes an issue whereby when the character undergoes the [[Shatter]] reaction, character switching or sprinting had a chance to abnormally trigger the Shatter special effects repeatedly.
# Fixes an issue whereby when playing in Japanese, German, English, Indonesian, Portuguese, and Vietnamese, some subtitles were missing in the cutscene animations of individual quests.
# Fixes some textual errors in 13 languages and optimizes text. "Note: Related in-game functions have not changed." (Travelers can view the changes in different languages by going to the [[Paimon Menu]] > [[Settings]] > Language and changing the Game Language.)<br />Text-related fixes and optimizations in English include:
#* Optimized instances of a term from "Kavikavus Prize" to "Pir Kavikavus Prize."
#* Optimized instances of a term from "Academia" to "Akademiya."
#* Optimized some lines in the quests and World Quests.
#* Optimized [[Yae Miko]]'s and [[Keqing]]'s descriptions.

==Known Issues==
# When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their [[Elemental Bursts]], there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
# Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character [[Kamisato Ayato]] (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his [[Kamisato Art: Kyouka|Elemental Skill]], "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.<br />The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in [[Version 3.0]] after comprehensive testing.<br />*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.
# There is an issue whereby in [[Photo Mode]], the eye model of the character [[Shikanoin Heizou]] will be displayed abnormally when he is performing a certain idle animation. This issue will be fixed in a later update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
# There is an issue with the character [[Shikanoin Heizou]]'s [[Heartstopper Strike|Elemental Skill]] whereby when you hit opponents under the effect of 4 Declension stacks (i.e. the Conviction effect), the elemental effect produced might be abnormal. After the fix, the elemental effect produced by the Elemental Skill at 4 Declension stacks will be consistent with that of other Declension stacks. This issue will be fixed in a later update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
# There is an issue whereby the avatar image of [[Diluc]]'s outfit "[[Red Dead of Night]]" is displayed abnormally. This issue will be fixed in a later update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
# There is an issue after the Version 2.8 update whereby some [[enemies]] (such as [[Geovishap Hatchling]]) have a small chance of displaying abnormal target tracking when casting their skills. This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned to our announcements.
# There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby the Treasure Chest will disappear abnormally if Travelers do not claim it in time after completing the World Quest "[[The Treasure of the Four Skerries]]." This issue will be fixed in a later update, please stay tuned to our announcements.
# There is an issue with the "[[Hidden Strife]]" event whereby there is a chance that characters are unable to trigger the relevant counts for the criteria "Deal DMG to opponents when using Claymores 15 times" or "Deal DMG with Normal Attacks 20 times" under specific circumstances, resulting in the inability to obtain "Afterimaged Might." Travelers who experience this issue can exit the game via the Paimon Menu and log in again as a temporary fix.
