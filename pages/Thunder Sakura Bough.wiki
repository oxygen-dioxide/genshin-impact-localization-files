{{Description|Thunder Sakura Boughs can be found on the various islands of Inazuma. Use them to summon a wondrous spirit called an [[Electrogranum]], which will be an inevitable travel companion in Inazuma~|[https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1415498855303495681 Inazuma Diaries Vol. 1: The Mysterious Electro Element]}}
'''Thunder Sakura Boughs''' are found in [[Inazuma]]. They can be used to summon [[Electrograna]].

Some Thunder Sakura Boughs are inactive and cannot be used to summon Electrograna until something else is done, such as defeating a nearby enemy or solving a nearby puzzle. These Thunder Sakura Boughs are surrounded by a faint purple-pink mist and will not have an Electrogranum in them.

Using a Thunder Sakura Bough may sometimes reveal [[Thunder Sphere]]s, which the player can use to travel swiftly through the air with their Electrogranum.
