'''Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome''' is an illness caused by direct contact with high concentrations of [[Abyss]]al power. It has negative effects on both physical and mental health, and can cause irreversible mental trauma.<ref name="FtSL">{{Ref/Quest|For the Same Land}}</ref>

==Overview==
The severity of Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome will vary according to the person's level of trauma. Symptoms include psychosis, often accompanied by visual and audial hallucinations, as well as reliving past traumas. For example, [[Atoco]] recalled his childhood experience of almost drowning, while the memory of [[Cochitta]]'s parents' death triggered her fear of losing her loved ones. Patients with superficial hallucinations can be treated with verbal and physical interaction, but extreme cases such as [[Ocotlan]] will only respond to the [[Draught of Lucidity]], a medicine developed by the [[Khaenri'ah]]n military doctor [[Guthred]].<ref name="FtSL"/>

[[Saurian]]s may also be susceptible to Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome, as [[Ayo]] was in a melancholic state following the Abyss invasion in [[Natlan]] due to the deaths of his grandparents, but his mood was restored by the Draught of Lucidity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Sun Rises and Sets}}</ref>
