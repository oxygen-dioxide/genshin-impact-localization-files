The '''Varuna Contraption''' is an [[Exploration]] mechanic in {{Location|Apam Woods}}. It allows the player to control the '''Varunastra''',  the giant pillar of water that maintains the constant cycle of rains to nurture the forest, which once was a desert.

==How to Unlock==
Before the player can use the Varuna Contraption, they must complete the {{Quest|A Prayer for Rain on the Fecund Land}}. At the end of the quest, the player finds the contraption in [[The Rain's End]]. They must then play the Rhythm of the Source Water song on the [[Vintage Lyre]] next to the contraption to activate it. This will also cause two smaller contraptions to appear in Apam Woods, one right next to the location where the Varunastra appears, and one further north, almost directly south of the [[Statue of The Seven]] near [[Pardis Dhyai]]. The smaller contraptions must also be activated with the Vintage Lyre before they can be used.

==In-Game Effects==
The Varuna Contraption works by changing the flow of water in Apam Woods, absorbing water from the area to create the Varunastra. In its default state, the [[Weather]] alternates between sunny and rainy in a 12-hour cycle. At the start of the cycle, which occurs at 00:00 and 12:00, the in-game water level in the area is lowered, as the water is being used to create the pillar of water and the rain. The Varunastra appears and immediately begins to produce rain, which lasts for a total of six hours, although the Varunastra itself is only maintained for 30 minutes. After the rain stops at 06:00 and 18:00, the in-game weather becomes clear and the water level rises to its original level, and they remain as such until the cycle restarts after six hours.

After unlocking the Varuna Contraptions, the player may interact with any of them to control the Varunastra. The player may cause it to be sunny or rainy continuously (also causing the water level to be raised or lowered, respectively), or return the device to its default cycle.

As there are several chests or other gameplay mechanics that can be exposed or immersed depending if it is raining or not, having full control of the Varunastra can be helpful for the player.

==Lore==
The Varuna Contraption was a device created by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] to summon "timely rains" in a section of the desert. After the forest labyrinth was created, the lord of the forest [[Viaghara]] was born from the moon's reflection on the water.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Laurel Coronet}}</ref><ref group="Note">The English description for The Coordinates of Sun and Rain omits the detail about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata summoning Varuna in the desert, which is present in the original Chinese description.</ref> It is a key part in the World Quest series [[Varuna Gatha]].

==Trivia==
* According to [[The Coordinates of Sun and Rain]]'s domain entrance description, Varuna was a spirit whose name means "water and sky." However, [[Laurel Coronet]]'s description calls it a device, and the Aranara consistently refer to it as a contraption. The former interpretation is, presumably, a distortion formed by human legends. Alternatively, the device might be named after the spirit.
* Taking a photo of the Varunastra using the [[Kamera]] during mid-activation grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement [[They Enter the Flow]].

===Etymology===
* {{w|Varuna}} is a Vedic deity associated with the sky, the seas, truth, and justice.
** Varuna is also referenced in some localizations' names for the [[Varunada Lazurite]] Character Ascension Material series.
** The {{W|Varunastra}} is a {{W|Astra (weapon)|weapon}} of water that channels Varuna's supernatural energy.
