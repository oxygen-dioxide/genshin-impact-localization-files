The '''Varuna Contraption''', whose name means "water and sky,"<ref>{{Ref/Domain|The Coordinates of Sun and Rain}}</ref> is an [[Exploration]] mechanic in [[Sumeru]]. To be able to use it, the player must complete the ''[[A Prayer for Rain on the Fecund Land]]'' [[World Quest]], where the contraption will be found in [[The Rain's End]]. They must then play the Rhythm of the Source Water song on the [[Vintage Lyre]] next to the contraption to activate it. This will also cause two smaller contraptions to appear in [[Apam Woods]], one right next to the location where the Varunastra appears, and one further north, almost directly south of the [[Statue of the Seven]] near [[Pardis Dhyai]]. The smaller contraptions must also be activated with the Vintage Lyre before they can be used. The player may interact with any of the three contraptions to control the [[Weather]] in [[Apam Woods]], making it sunny or rainy, which also affects the water level.

==Lore==
It was a device created by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] to summon "timely rains" in a section of the desert. After the forest labyrinth was created, the lord of the forest [[Viaghara]] was born from the moon's reflection on the water.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Laurel Coronet}}</ref><ref group="Note">The English description for The Coordinates of Sun and Rain omits the detail about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata summoning Varuna in the desert, which is present in the original Chinese description.</ref> It is a key part in the World Quest series [[Varuna Gatha]].

==In-Game Effects==
The device works by changing the flow of water in Apam Woods, absorbing water from the area to create the {{w|Varunastra}}, the giant pillar of water that maintains the constant cycle of rains to nurture the forest, which once was a desert.

One cycle lasts 12 hours. At the start of the cycle, which occurs at 00:00 and 12:00, the in-game water level in the area is lowered, as the water is being used to create the pillar of water and the rain. The Varunastra appears and immediately begins to produce rain, which lasts for a total of 6 hours, although the Varunastra itself is only maintained for 30 minutes. After the rain stops at 06:00 and 18:00, the in-game weather becomes clear and the water level rises to its original level, and they remain as such until the cycle restarts after 6 hours.

==Trivia==
*According to [[The Coordinates of Sun and Rain]]'s domain entrance description, Varuna was a spirit; however, [[Laurel Coronet]]'s description calls it a device, and the Aranara consistently refer to it as a contraption. The former interpretation is, presumably, a distortion formed by human legends.
*Taking a photo of the Varunastra using the [[Kamera]] grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement [[They Enter the Flow]].

===Etymology===
*{{w|Varuna}} is a Vedic deity associated with the sky, the seas, truth, and justice.
**Varuna is also referenced in some localizations' names for the [[Varunada Lazurite]] Character Ascension Material series.
**The {{W|Varunastra}} is a {{W|Astra (weapon)|weapon}} of water that channels Varuna's supernatural energy.
