|text    = Lemme share a piece of great news with you! Recently, I'm able to catch [[Crystalfly|Crystalflies]] with just a little jump. I used to have to try so hard to reach them... So, I must've grown taller!

Um, but I'm not very, very sure. What if they just happened to fly closer to the ground recently...

Could you come over to see if I've really gotten taller?

You can... you know, pat my head to measure my height, but not for too long!

You're my best friend, so I know you won't lie to me. But if I really haven't grown taller, please help me think of other methods.

This is a secret between us only. Don't tell the [[Kano Nana|shrine maiden]]... um, and [[Kamisato Ayaka|Miss Kamisato]]... and [[Yae Miko|Lady Guuji]]... and...

Zzz...
