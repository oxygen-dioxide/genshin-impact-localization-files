'''Rongzhao''' was an exorcist and [[Yelan]]'s ancestor who fought at [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]] during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago. While he returned to Liyue Harbor, unlike his brother [[Boyang]], he went insane from exposure to [[Bosacius]]' [[karma]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Rongzhao was an ancestor of Yelan and Boyang's younger brother. The two fought against the monsters that poured out of The Chasm during the cataclysm, alongside the [[Millelith]] and later joined by the rogue [[yaksha]] Bosacius, who had long gone insane. During the battle, they discovered a mysterious underground palace with the uncanny ability to weaken the power of the [[Abyss]]. A number of Millelith, as well as Boyang and Bosacius, decided to lure the Abyssal monsters into this space and seal themselves within; Rongzhao was among the group which sealed the domain from outside. Despite surviving the battle, Rongzhao lost his sanity, which [[Xiao]] and Yelan attribute to the effect of Bosacius' karma; since Rongzhao did not have a [[Vision]], he would not have been able to resist karma's effects for very long.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|At Tunnel's End, Light}}</ref> After the battle in the Chasm, Rongzhao's insanity would only be eased whenever he passed by [[Wangshu Inn]], where Xiao dwells.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yelan|About Xiao}}</ref>
