{{Description|Plain or ostentatious? Traditional or avant-garde? Stick to the rules, or pursue freedom? These are the questions that designers often ask, and the answers lie within their works.<br>But the owner of Chioriya Boutique, "The Thundering Seamstress," is difficult to read. As the edges of her incisive blades dance to and fro across the fabric, it seems as though there was never such a choice at all, or perhaps there was only ever one choice for her — the one she likes.}}

==Summary==
;Where Honed Blades Clash

Hearing about the Fontaine Fashion Week, the Traveler and [[Paimon]] run into Chiori and [[Laetitia]] at her [[Chioriya Boutique|shop]]. Laetitia asks Chiori about her dress, worried that she had resorted to cheaper materials due to the lower cost she paid for it. Chiori states that she would never stoop so low and the deposit was enough to finish it off. Laetitia is excited to wear a Chioriya dress, believing such an endeavor impossible. Chiori gives her some instructions on how to care for the gown, before sending her off. The two ask her about the fashion show. She explains that it occurs once a year, and is a major event for fashion designers due to the exposure provided, one of which contributed to her success. Paimon wonders if she has to participate, though Chiori explains the meaning of fashion and that people would not patronize a business if they did not release anything new. She intends to participate and is waiting for her shipment of fabrics from [[Inazuma]] to arrive from [[Komaniya Express]] from their [[Kirara|trusty courier]].

Kirara then arrives, apologizing to Chiori for the late delivery. Chiori asks her what went wrong, and Kirara is initially hesitant to tell, but her tails betray her expressions. She admits that she was beset by bandits who were ordered to target a courier with two tails. While she easily bested them, she wondered who ordered a hit on her and investigated. She suggests they drop the investigation, but Chiori is upset that someone would target her friends and intends to teach them a lesson. Kirara then tells them that the person who ordered the hit was [[Uther]], who Chiori recognizes. The two explain to the Traveler and Paimon that Uther is a designer who is trying to slander Chiori's business and name. As such, she decides to go to his place, so Kirara asks the Traveler and Paimon to follow Chiori to ensure she doesn't go out of bounds, as she's worried that the negative publicity would harm her chances at the fashion show.

Following Chiori, they run into [[Chevreuse]]. Chiori informs Chevreuse of her intentions, so they follow her to Uther's place. She goes in to talk with him, while Chevreuse explains about her relationship with Chiori and the benefits she provides the Special Patrol. As a result, Chevreuse often has to protect her from those wishing ill from her, primarily the rich and powerful, though admits sometimes she has to protect the people from her instead. She then asks them who had angered Chiori. Upon hearing that Uther was responsible, she too is also surprised, explaining that he is a known troublemaker for Chiori and was warned by the [[Maison Gardiennage]] as a result. As Chiori throws Uther out of his home, Chevreuse feigns ignorance, with Uther claiming that it isn't over as he leaves. Chiori asks Chevreuse for a future favor.

Returning to Chioriya Boutique, Chiori informs Kirara that she'll be protected for the rest of her time in Fontaine by both the Special Patrol and [[Spina di Rosula]]. Kirara initially believes that the security is too much for her, though she accepts when Chiori insists. Chiori explains that this particular fashion week is of prime importance, as many new supplies are intending to participate and getting their attention would be beneficial. She offers to let them model for her to finish up the remaining touches on her dresses, asking them to meet her at her shop tomorrow.

;Stained Spots

The next day, the Traveler and Paimon arrive early at the shop. Chiori informs them that Kirara was well protected for the rest of her stay, with [[Navia]] also coming along and giving her some macarons as a send-off gift. This prompts Paimon to remark on how the two are similar, which Chiori also agrees with as she admires her determination and courage despite the odds. Chiori then realizes the shop is going to open soon and asks the Traveler to help set up the displays for her. Upon putting them in place, Chiori begins to take measurements of the two just as a customer, [[Leeann]], comes in, telling her she wants her order canceled, apologizing in advance. Paimon notices that something was odd about her as Chiori explains that cancellations are quite common, just as another customer, [[Weis]], enters and asks for her. He wishes to return his item, though Chiori inquires as to the reason why. He dodges the question until customers outside begin accusing Chiori of supplying criminals. Weis states that the news are on the papers and that the fabric she uses was provided by underground factories. Chiori states that she had always been transparent with her sources, but calls for [[Eloffe]] to deal with the return requests, aware that someone was trying to distract her from Fashion Week. 

Eloffe then returns, informing Chiori that her accessory supplier would not supply them during the show. Without the accessories, her clothes would lack meaning, so Chiori decides to talk with them herself. The Traveler and Paimon accompany her to the supplier, [[Wenger]]. He explains to her that he had withdrawn because of the news he had heard, which did not come from [[The Steambird]], but from second-rate tabloids. Someone had paid them to publish the same article at once, dropping them at every home in the city. Chiori points out that the fact that they came from less reputable sources confirmed their lack of authenticity, but he shows her a paper with the incident from yesterday, thus putting public opinion against her. He also states that he has to take care of his daughter's business, not wanting her to get impacted by the fallout. He initially suggests she drop out this year, but she refuses to, so he wishes her luck instead.

Chiori realizes that Uther had known her to well and had planned everything in advance and goes off to ponder her next options. As she leaves, [[Charlotte]] arrives and speaks to the Traveler and Paimon, knowing that the tabloids did not share the same integrity as the Steambird does, wanting to help prove her innocence. They try to find Chiori, but fail to find her, so they return to her shop, believing she might be there instead. When they arrive, they find Eloffe and Laetitia. Laetitia heard of the news and in her excitement, revealed the gown to her fiancé; despite the cost, Chiori had covered the remainder that they could not. Thus, she wants to help prove her innocence too.

Eloffe wonders why Chiori was not with them and realizes she might be hanging out at a cliff near the sea where she usually went when upset. Charlotte remains behind to interview Laetitia, whereas the Traveler and Paimon find Chiori in the [[Liffey Region]]. Chiori is initially surprised to see them but realizes that Eloffe informed them of her whereabouts. She talks about her past to the two, where she was raised as a seemingly spoiled and troublesome child by her parents. However, upon noticing her talent at needlework, they sent her to a master tailor to learn the skills, though she became angered at having to cater to arrogant higher-ups and became despised after a few incidents. Out of frustration and anger, she left Inazuma for Fontaine, where she began her work anew and to make her brand known across Teyvat. 

Chiori then decides that she'll deal with both Uther and the show at once, though without a supplier, she would need to find new accessories. She looks at the sea and realizes that there's inspiration there, so they collect various items before returning to the store for materials. Without any new fabric coming in, Chiori decides that they'll just salvage what they can from the clothes on display, having done so during her first submissions on Fashion Week. The Traveler destroys the clothes, salvaging whatever fabric was usable. Upon finishing the task, Navia runs in and initially believes that someone destroyed her shop and promises to send the Spina at them. She becomes shocked upon learning the Traveler did so, but apologizes for her outburst when Chiori explains that she had them do so. Chiori asks Navia to supply her with some hands for sewing and another task. Chiori then asks the Traveler to fetch [[Lyney]] and [[Lynette]], just as Charlotte bursts in and is angered in a similar manner as Navia.

The Traveler and Paimon head to their home and find Lyney and Lynette, who were just about to look for Chiori themselves. As she had supplied them their outfits and even sponsored one of their shows, they decide that it's time for them to repay her kindness. The Traveler informs the twins of her plan and they agree to help.

;The Woven and the Cut

Two days later, the Traveler and Paimon meet up with Chiori at [[Court of Fontaine: Fleuve Cendre|Fleuve Cendre]], where Uther's factory is located. As the show is his primary focus, Chiori believes that it's a perfect time to collect incriminating evidence, having left the show matters to Eloffe. They enter the factory and are taken on a seemingly mundane tour, though they discover a secret elevator to a deeper part of the factory, guarded by [[Clockwork Meka]]. As they continue investigating, they discover that Uther was producing clothes from unsanitary conditions. They take several photos and venture deeper inside, only to be locked in. Chiori reveals that she and Uther were once partners, having wanted to make their own interpretation of fashion. However, with numerous rejections, Uther gave up whereas Chiori did not. Thus, when she opened up her shop, Uther had begun to harass her ever since. 
[[File:Story Teaser - Tapestry of Night - Genshin Impact|thumb|float|right]]
At the end of the factory, Uther confronts the three with his meka guards, not intending to let the evidence out of his factory. Chiori confronts him over his meaning of "fashion", which Uther finds absurd and his jaded view meant that he wanted Chiori to fail like he had. Uther is annoyed at her refusal to submit and pulls out a gun on the three. The Traveler suggests that Chiori return to continue the plan, but she refuses and instead tells them to do so. Uther tries to shoot them, but Chiori parries his shot. Having held back because of their former partnership, Chiori proclaims that she'll show him the true meaning of her business, easily dispatching him and his guards. The fashion show is likewise a success.

The group returns to the boutique where Navia and Kirara set up a new sign for the business. Chiori thanks everyone for their assistance, not wanting to let it go unpaid, though Navia and Kirara decline a reward. Chevreuse then arrives, upset by Chiori's actions as it had given her a lot of anxiety, though Chiori states that she couldn't ask for more since they busted an underground factory and brought the man responsible for doing so to them. Chevreuse also has a message from Wegner, though Chiori already knows that he was profusely apologizing to her and states she'll just to talk to him in person for it. Navia then leads the group out for a celebratory feast, while Chiori asks the Traveler and Paimon to meet her at her hangout spot.

Returning to said spot, Chiori hands the two a customized brooch for their invaluable assistance. Paimon wonders if what she said at the show could rub people off the wrong way, but Chiori states that she would never bow to or scrape to anything in the world, confident in her work. Paimon then asks if they should return to the city for the feast, which she agrees to, remarking that this particular night is the loveliest she had in the nation so far.
