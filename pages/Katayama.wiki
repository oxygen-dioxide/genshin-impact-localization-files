{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Katayama:''' When will those slackers from the [[Shogunate]] start doing their jobs? None of the fortifications we've worked so hard to build have been used.
:'''Yabuki:''' *sigh* You should be grateful to still be alive, given these chaotic times. And we wouldn't have the opportunity to work here if it wasn't for the Shogunate, so stop complaining.
:'''Katayama:''' Bah! What does the Shogunate have to do with our well-being!? It was I that led everyone out after the [[Mikage Furnace]] incident in Tatarasuna. The Shogunate did absolutely nothing!
:'''Yabuki:''' Haha, you're right. You saved my life as well, so I've still got to thank you for that.
:'''Yabuki:''' I know that everyone's been deeply saddened that we lost our safe haven and ended up having to work for the Shogunate when the Mikage Furnace was destroyed.
:'''Yabuki:''' But the way I see it, the Shogunate is still by far the best faction to side with. Once everything is over, we will definitely get the reward we deserve. They are the ones in power, after all.
:'''Katayama:''' Hmph, I just hope that you're right.
