{{Quote|Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace.|[[Tartaglia]]<ref name="tartVO">{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About Tsaritsa}}</ref>}}

The '''Tsaritsa''' {{Lang|ru=Царица|ru_rm=Tsaritsa}}, true [[Archon]] name and her corresponding ideal yet unknown, is the [[Cryo Archon]] and one of [[The Seven]] who presides over [[Snezhnaya]].

With supreme rule over Snezhnaya, she uses her loyal followers in the [[Fatui]] to manipulate and intimidate the other nations of [[Teyvat]]. She is targeting the other Archons' [[Gnoses]] for reasons unknown, though it likely relates to her goal of "burning away the old world."

The Tsaritsa also has the ability to grant her subjects a power separate from [[Vision]]s, called [[Delusion]]s. [[Fatui Cicin Mages]], [[Fatui Pyro Agent|Pyro Agents]], and [[Mirror Maiden]]s use one in battle, and it is said that all [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] possess one as well.

==Profile==
===Introduction===
{{Quote|Sorry... to also have you shoulder the grievances of the world.<br />Since you could endure my bitter cold, you must have the desire to burn?<br />Then, burn away the old world for me.|The Tsaritsa, in the description for [[Shivada Jade Gemstone]]}}

The Tsaritsa is not one of the original members of The Seven who emerged victorious at the end of the [[Archon War]]. When and how she ascended to the position of Cryo Archon is yet unknown, but it was some time before the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago which left her deeply changed.<ref name="ending note">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref>

In the [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview], [[Dainsleif]] says of the Tsaritsa and Snezhnaya: ''"She is a god with no love left for her people, nor do they have any left for her. Her followers only hope to be on her side when the day of her rebellion against the divine comes at last."'' This most likely refers to [[Celestia]], or someone or something located on Celestia.

===Personality===
Little is known about the Tsaritsa, but many of her followers are deeply devoted to her. Whether it is out of genuine faith or fear is unclear, but [[Tartaglia]]'s dedication to her is at least real: he describes her as "a gentle soul that had to harden herself." He also says that her actions, while having seemingly engulfed the world in war, are meant to bring about peace.<ref name="tartVO" /> His [[Tartaglia/Lore#Delusion|character stories]] also describe her as a "true warrior."

An incident 500 years ago left her deeply embittered and changed.<ref name="ending note" /> Whatever happened back then, [[Barbatos]] drew her ire; she has [[Signora]] attack and steal his Gnosis without warning, which is a stark contrast compared to the way she negotiates with [[Morax]] for his.

While talking about the kites that represent The Seven, [[Zhongli]], Morax's vessel, doesn't ascribe a trait to her like he does with the other Archons; he begins saying "as does that which the Cryo Archon once..." before trailing off with a sigh.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Downtown}}</ref> This suggests that whatever trait he was about to say, she no longer possesses.

===Appearance===
Nothing is known about the Tsaritsa's appearance besides the fact that she uses a female vessel. Tartaglia's character stories describe her gaze as "cold yet pure".

==Story==
===History===
At some point in the history of The Seven, the Tsaritsa inherited her position from the previous Cryo Archon. She is not the original archon who emerged victorious from the [[Archon War]]. She witnessed the events of the Cataclysm which left her severely embittered.

===Archon Quests===
While the Tsaritsa does not appear in any quests, her Harbingers enforce her will and goal of rebelling against the divine, having tasked them with obtaining her fellow Archons' Gnoses. She has [[Signora]] collect the Gnoses, first having Signora take [[Barbatos]]' by force due to the animosity between the two. She negotiated with Morax for his Gnosis, offering him something that he accepted as the "contract to end all contracts". After [[Paimon]] inquired as to what she offered, Morax's vessel, [[Zhongli]], informed her and the [[Traveler]] that they would find out themselves in their journey across Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Among The Seven, the Tsaritsa's ideal is currently the only one left unconfirmed. In the Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview, [[Dainsleif]] calls her a "god with no love left" in the opening sentence about the Snezhnaya Chapter, which is where he mentions all other Archons' ideals during their respective chapters. Zhongli avoids mentioning her ideal when he names the other Seven's during "[[Downtown]]," suggesting her ideal may have changed since the [[cataclysm]].
** In the Chinese name for [[Shivada Jade Gemstone]] and its item series, "Shivada" is instead {{Lang|mini=1|zh=哀叙冰|zh_rm=Āixù Bīng|zh_tl=Grieving Ice|zh_lit=Grief-Narrating Ice}}. The word for "grief," {{Lang|mini=1|zh=哀|zh_rm=āi}}, uses similar sounds as the word for "love," {{Lang|mini=1|zh=爱|zh_rm=ài}}.
*** In Japanese, the name is {{Lang|mini=yes|ja={{Rubi|哀|あい|切|せつ|なアイスクリスタル}}|ja_rm=Aisetsu na Aisu Kurisutaru|ja_tl=Plaintive Ice Crystal}}. The kanji meaning "grief", {{Lang|mini=yes|ja=哀|ja_rm=}}, in this case using the reading ''ai'', is a homophone with the kanji meaning "love", {{Lang|mini=yes|ja=愛|ja_rm=ai}}; furthermore, the actual word for grief or sadness, {{Lang|mini=yes|ja={{Rubi|哀|かな|しみ}}|ja_rm=kanashimi}}, has an archaism meaning love or affection, written {{Lang|mini=yes|ja={{Rubi|愛|かな|しみ}}|ja_rm=kanashimi}}.
* Tsaritsa is the female equivalent of a {{w|Tsar}}. The title has multiple spellings including {{w|Tsarina}}.
