'''Fires''' ''(unofficial name)'' are objects found in [[exploration]], including campfires, stoves, torches and bonfires.

These objects can be lit using {{Pyro}} attacks. Once lit, they will require 1 [[Gauge Unit]] of {{Hydro}}/{{Electro}} or 2 Gauge Units of {{Anemo}}/{{Cryo}}/{{Geo}} to extinguish.

While lit, these objects will deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}} every 0.5s to players that stand too close. Campfires and stoves will also enable [[Cooking]].

The level of fires will vary greatly depending on the location. They are much lower than that of enemies and most interactive objects. At [[World Level]] 8:
* [[Mondstadt]] fires range from Lv. 45 to Lv. 59
* [[Liyue]] (excluding [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]]) fires range from Lv. 52 to Lv. 60
* [[Inazuma]] (excluding [[Enkanomiya]]) and [[Sumeru]] fires range from Lv. 57 to Lv. 60
* Fires in The Chasm and Enkanomiya are Lv. 62

Note that the DMG dealt by fires is not to be confused with the [[Burning]] Elemental Reaction, as the latter requires {{Dendro}} as fuel, deals DoT at shorter intervals, and scales with the level and Elemental Mastery of the triggering party. Applying Dendro to lit fires will also trigger the Burning reaction and deal additional instances of DMG.
