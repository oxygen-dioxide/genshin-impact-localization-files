==Personality==
{{Quote|A wee knight born to an ordinary family. He serves as a Front-Line Surveyor in his Company. He is a low-key and cautious character.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Seemingly shy and distant at first, Mika eventually warms up to the people he knows. To those unfamiliar to him, especially those with high rankings, Mika prefers to observe them and understand their personalities before properly interacting with them as a sign of respect.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Charity Event! A Great Success!}}</ref> He does seem to rely on other people for decisions, such as when to talk or what to say.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sounds From Afar (Quest)}}</ref>

Despite his young age, Mika is mature and responsible, taking care of his older brother when he comes home drunk and completes his tasks without complaining or having much issue with them. He enjoys cartography, wanting to become Mondstadt's expert cartographer and expressing a desire to map all of Teyvat. While friends with [[Klee]], he often has to remap due to her explosives altering the landscape, though he does not mind.

{{Quote|I recruited Mika into the expedition team to hone his combat skills. As for why he reports directly to me...

Mika, who is a member of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company, always diligently fulfills all the duties that come his way.

Setting up tents, lighting fires for cooking, repairing equipment... Even Hertha, the logistics captain, has nothing but praise for Mika's excellent efficiency.

Mika's dedication to work is not due to a weak character or his inability to say no, but instead stems from the value that he attaches to teamwork, and a genuine desire to learn from his experienced colleagues.

"Helping everyone as much as possible benefits the entire team too!"

Mika's favorite pastime is closely linked to his primary duty as a front-line surveyor.

That is: surveying unexplored regions, recording topographical data, and drawing accurate and effective maps.

"There is an abundance of resources here, but it is surrounded by monsters. Take note to exercise caution."

Mika, whose dream is to become an expert cartographer, adds another annotation to the new version of the military map he is designing.

|text1         = <p>Whenever he shows up at the Knights of Favonius headquarters, Mika always swiftly finishes any discussions to be had with his fellow knights, then quietly slips away to avoid becoming a hindrance to others' work.</p><!--
              --><p>Mika always gets nervous when someone strikes up a conversation with him, frantically scampering away right after politely putting an end to the idle chatter.</p><!--
              --><p>The knights know that the young man's name is Mika, and that he is Huffman's younger brother and the second son of the Schmidt family. They also know that he is a member of the Reconnaissance Company, but nothing much beyond that.</p><!--
              --><p>Few are aware of what Mika's job entails, nor do they know that the widely-promoted, updated version of their military map is the fruit of his labors.</p><!--
              --><p>The new map consists of detailed statistical data regarding almost every corner of Mondstadt with practical markers indicating road conditions, areas with heightened monster activity, high ground that can serve as temporary strongholds, and the distribution of natural resources... The amount of detail could almost make your head spin.</p><!--
              --><p>All of this is the result of Mika's own labor throughout the two years he has spent traveling all across Mondstadt and investigating every inch of terrain he set foot on.</p><!--
              --><p>Knights who have fought alongside Mika know that he finds using both lance and crossbow at the same time the most convenient, and his unique fighting style has left a lasting impression.</p><!--
              --><p>However, they have also been solemnly "warned" by Mika to never speak of him to others unless absolutely necessary.</p><!--
              --><p>"Mika's terrified of drawing the attention of others &mdash; he'll get nervous if you so much as stare at him, to say nothing of showering him with compliments. He's been a great asset to the Knights and helped us out a lot, so respecting his boundaries is the least we can do as seniors!"</p>

|friendship2   = 2
|text2         = <p>Mika comes from a loving family. His mother works as an author writing about local conditions, his father is a retired Knight of Favonius, and his older brother Huffman is a current member in the Knights' ranks.</p><!--
              --><p>When Mika began learning to read, his mother went inspiration-gathering abroad with his father accompanying her. During that time, the responsibility of looking after little Mika landed in Huffman's hands.</p><!--
              --><p>However, Huffman had already made the Knights of Favonius his second home &mdash; he was preoccupied with work during the day and indulged in drinking with his friends night after night. With his own life lacking organization, how was he expected to take care of his little brother?</p><!--
              --><p>So it was little Mika who learned to take care of both himself and his brother whenever he'd return home drunk at night. When other children his age were enjoying their childhood without a care, Mika had already learned to stick to an organized schedule, sometimes even helping Huffman with his everyday chores.</p><!--
              --><p>While they were away, Mika's parents always made sure to send a letter back to Mondstadt every week to keep their children from worrying. Mika's mother, being an excellent writer, could somehow describe the scenery she's seen in a mesmerizing way akin to fairytales. Mika loved to read his parents' letters before looking for their exact location and marking out their travel route on a map. Picturing his parents' wonderful adventures was Mika's favorite pastime.</p><!--
              --><p>Before long, Mika developed a passion for reading maps, and even committed the terrain of many locations to memory.</p><!--
              --><p>Unfortunately, Huffman had to ruin the mood when he broke the bad news to Mika: "I'm afraid your efforts have been wasted on the map Mom and Dad left us. It's very outdated, and it wasn't very accurately drawn in the first place." But that was to be expected. After all, those who with the ability freely explore the wilderness would likely have all become adventurers with nothing but commissions and Mora on their minds. To them, just about any map would do.</p><!--
              --><p>On the other hand, most of those who knew how to draw decent maps were not skilled in combat, so it would be much too dangerous for them to survey the wilderness themselves. Not to mention their limited income, which wouldn't allow them to afford bodyguards. Perhaps the time would come when the Knights of Favonius finally had sufficient budget to hire experts to deal with matters like these, but with Mondstadt as peaceful as one could hope for, no one knew for sure when something as trivial as cartography could be put on the schedule. So little Mika thought to himself: If he could reach every corner of the world just like his parents, and record every detail of the terrain beneath his feet... That would be the most fun ever.</p><!--
              --><p>From then on, Mika set a clear goal for himself.</p><!--
              --><p>"I'll become Mondstadt's expert cartographer."</p>

|text3         = <p>When Mika's parents returned to Mondstadt, they were delighted to hear of Mika's new-found goal and promised to do whatever they could to support him.</p><!--
              --><p>From that day on, Mika dedicated most of his time to poring over geography books and assiduously honing his drawing skills in the library.</p><!--
              --><p>Lisa took a liking to this polite, gifted yet hardworking child and often recommended books to him, guiding him towards the most efficient path.</p><!--
              --><p>After some time, Mika gained Lisa's recognition &mdash; "With your current skills and abilities, you just might qualify for studying at the Akademiya."</p><!--
              --><p>It was then that Mika began looking for opportunities to put his knowledge to the test. As it happens, Ella Musk, whom he had gotten acquainted with while studying at the library, happened to be looking for a guide for a language exchange trip to the secluded wilderness.</p><!--
              --><p>And that became Mika's first real expedition. Though they did safely arrive at their destination, due to an error in Ella Musk's word choice, the pair ended up getting beaten by the hilichurls.</p><!--
              --><p>Mika concluded that this setback was due to his lack of combat prowess. "I need to learn how to protect myself," he thought, "or I won't be able to guarantee the success of my expeditions to unfamiliar areas."</p><!--
              --><p>Thereafter, Mika rode the momentum from his time spent learning in the library and began to learn fighting techniques from his brother. Luckily, Mika had a strong constitution and quickly grasped the basics.</p><!--
              --><p>It happened that the Knights of Favonius had just drafted their plan for an expedition set to depart three years later. They were still looking to recruit a few more members to fill some positions, and "Front-Line Surveyor" was among the open spots.</p><!--
              --><p>This role had strict prerequisites: those applying for the position should have some level of expertise in cartography, and due to potentially dangerous conditions, they would be leading the team from the front lines, making combat skills a must.</p><!--
              --><p>This was Mika's chance, but it all felt too much like a dream...</p><!--
              --><p>Mika initially believed that he would be invited into the team as an external consultant, but the position of Front-Line Surveyor would no doubt make him a full-fledged member of the expedition &mdash; and one crucial to the entire team. He was daunted by the thought at first, afraid that he wasn't worthy of such an important role that according to him, "only the strongest would qualify for."</p><!--
              --><p>His doubts were soon dispelled by his father and brother's encouragement, and he remembers their words to this day:</p><!--
              --><p>"You don't have to ask too much of yourself. Doing your best to help will be more than enough."</p><!--
              --><p>"Most of the knights are just ordinary people like us, but once we put our strengths together as a team, even the strongest of adventurers would struggle to prove our equal."</p><!--
              --><p>Thus, Mika seized the opportunity and signed up for the position.</p><!--
              --><p>He felt reassured that he would, at least, be dedicating his time to what he loved.</p>

              --><p>The anxiety from unexpectedly becoming the center of attention made his breaths quicken as his heart pounded &mdash; Mika was afraid of failing the Knights' assessment and disgracing his father, ruining his brother's career, or worse, ruining the reputation of his family name.</p><!--
              --><p>Considering that many members of the Schmidt family had already joined their ranks, the Knights of Favonius decided to raise the bar for entry and make the whole assessment process public in order to make the selection as fair as possible.</p><!--
              --><p>Taking real-life scenarios into consideration, lead examiner Kaeya came up with a series of challenges that strictly assessed the participants' abilities:</p><!--
              --><p>Hiking up Dragonspine while wearing full armor and carrying a heavy load;</p><!--
              --><p>Mapping out a monster-infested region without the aid of any reference material...</p><!--
              --><p>Luckily, Mika came well-prepared and gave it his all, eventually passing the most difficult challenge and becoming one of three successful candidates.</p><!--
              --><p>The other two candidates had both received Mika's aid along the way as well &mdash; to him, they were more like future teammates than competitors, in any case.</p><!--
              --><p>Mika's excellent exhibition of teamwork gained the recognition of Grand Master Varka, who allocated the two other new recruits to the Cavalry Company and Investigation Team, while personally taking Mika in to go with him on his expedition.</p><!--
              --><p>Every week, Varka would teach Mika combat techniques and give him assorted "homework" to complete.</p><!--
              --><p>Mika would later join the Reconnaissance Company. Communicating with its rather unusual Captain further strengthened his communication skills, which would help him greatly when working with the elite knights of the expedition team.</p><!--
              --><p>After joining the Knights, Mika honed his cartography skills while investigating dangerous locations as a Front-Line Surveyor while receiving pointers on how he might improve his other skills from Varka.</p><!--

              --><p>At the send-off party, Grand Master Varka was pleasantly surprised by the shiny new Vision on Mika's right wrist. But after personally inviting Mika to spar, he concluded that Mika's current abilities were "remarkable, but far from enough."</p><!--

              --><p>In the depths of the pitch-dark night, Mika could vaguely make out a line of soldiers, silently standing there as if they were lifeless war machines.</p><!--
              --><p>And right in the middle of the enemy formation was a dark, distinct silhouette. Even though torches lit the area, Mika could see nothing but their eerily dark blue eyes that seemed to glow with an uncanny aura.</p><!--
              --><p>At his teammate's reminder, Mika learned of their identity &mdash; the Fatui Harbinger known as "[[Il Capitano|The Captain]]" and his direct, elite subordinates.</p><!--

              --><p>The Harbinger, in particular &mdash; Mika knew that he would be utterly helpless to parry a single half-hearted swipe from this person.</p><!--

* Mika's dialogue in the {{quest|Heart of the Deep}} strongly suggests that the Schmidt family is from [[Springvale]], having extensively interacted with [[Old Finch]] over time like a local would. There is no apparent reason otherwise for why Mika would be in Springvale while he was studying cartography.
* According to his voice-line "Favorite Food" he has drunk alcohol before, but can't hold it well. While Eula mentions in ''[[Receiver of Friends From Afar: Part IV]]'' that Mika can't drink alcohol, this seems to be a reference to his limited tolerance rather than his age. <ref>{{Ref/Quest|Receiver of Friends From Afar: Part IV}}</ref>
* Mika is one of the characters with ornaments that glow. {{Transclude|Soaring Beacon|Glowing Ornaments}}
* Mika shares his Korean voice actress, Yoon Eun-seo, with [[Dunyarzad]].
