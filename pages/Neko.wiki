==Profile==
Neko is a cat that has lived for at least 500 years, during the [[cataclysm]] and the time of [[Asase Hibiki]] and [[Ako Domeki]]. She and the other cats presumably lived at [[Asase Shrine]] and enjoyed spending time with Hibiki as she created [[Invigorating Kitty Meal|delicious meals]] for all to share. Unbeknownst to Neko, Hibiki drastically changed after the events of the cataclysm, and while she managed to live a relatively normal life after returning from the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]], she had been deeply affected by the deaths of [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]] and the [[Kitsune Saiguu]]. She later helped Domeki fight off a Shogunate fleet despite the pirate's insistence that she stay out of his affairs, breaking the wards and unleashing a [[Thunder Manifestation]], causing a huge thunderstorm that resulted in Hibiki and Domeki disappearing.

The island would remain in mostly perpetual thunderstorms and Neko waited at the shrine, hoping for Hibiki's return and took the position of Provisional Head Priestess at the shrine to keep the place intact, but she and the remaining cats were unable to maintain the shrine and it fell into disrepair. Domeki and his fleet eventually returned to the island, but it had fallen into ruins due to the Thunder Manifestation and they left to set sail for other lands. Neko appeared to be unaware of his return.

500 years later, Seirai Island would be visited by [[Eiko]], [[Taisuke]], and the [[Traveler]]. The former two were part of the [[Adventurers' Guild]], commissioned to investigate the island and discovered the broken wards, while the Traveler had just set foot and was encountered the two. The Traveler offered to help them and used [[Elemental Sight]] to discover cat tracks leading to the shrine, where they met Neko. Neko told them that the shrine had fallen into disrepair and had them repair the shrine's offering box so people could deposit Mora, unaware that the village had been abandoned for hundreds of years. Once they did so, she told them how to repair the wards, which ended the thunderstorms and made the cats comfortable.

After the thunderstorms around the island were dealt with, Neko would task the Traveler with putting the shrine back in order and helping out the cats in her care. After "hiring" [[Ooshima Junpei]] to create a statue of her, upon performing the finishing touch, a cloud overhead shaped itself into a cat, which Neko interpreted as a good sign from Hibiki and the others. Neko promised to introduce the four to Hibiki and her friends when they returned and began making preparations for their eventual arrival. After taking a stroll around the island, she discovered that the village was devoid of life and wondered where their inhabitants had gone, unaware of the events that had taken place back then.

Neko eventually heard of the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] and requested the Traveler bring her there. She was amazed by the shrine's large offering box, although still stating that her shrine was better. After inquiring about Hibiki, she decided to return to her shrine and continue waiting for Hibiki's return.

===Personality===
Neko is devoted to Hibiki, having named several of the cats in her care "Konbumaru" as she could tell that it meant something positive for Hibiki, but is completely unaware of the dark secrets she endured and performed. Her duties at the shrine mostly involve "maintenance" to ensure the shrine would be kept in pristine condition upon Hibiki's return. She is not used to human terms, mistaking salary as "celery" and typically addresses people based on their appearance and/or duties, calling Junpei the "stone human" due to his expertise in carving stone. She is also terrified of Taisuke, as she believes that he knows too much about cats' weaknesses.

Unlike other cats, Neko is capable of human speech.

===Appearance===
Neko has the appearance of a black cat with large, golden eyes. She is also notably larger in size compared to regular cats.<ref group="Note">As seen in [[Neko Is a Cat: The Children]], when [["Konbumaru"]] and [["Hachihou"]] are placed beside her</ref>

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[Neko Is a Cat: A "Good Turn" Comes Late]])
:'''Neko:''' Hmm... The scent of a human, and a familiar one, too...
:'''Neko:''' Huh, so it wasn't [[Hibiki]] after all.
:{{DIcon}} A talking cat?
::'''Neko:''' Hmph. Such a fuss you make, human.
::'''Neko:''' Of course cats can speak. It is simply that human ears cannot comprehend them.
:{{DIcon}} Who's Hibiki?
::'''Neko:''' Hibiki is Hibiki. She came from this shrine.
::'''Neko:''' A long, long... long, long time ago, after a huge thunderstorm, Hibiki never returned... and there was no one to help brush my fur thereafter.
::'''Neko:''' Until Hibiki returns, I will care for the shrine, and will brush my own fur, meow meow.
:{{DIcon}} The Warding Stones have been sealed.
::'''Neko:''' Have they indeed? Most swift of you.
::'''Neko:''' This way, my hair shall never again stand on end or be warped into furballs.
::'''Neko:''' Excellent, excellent. Meow, meow.
:{{DIcon}} See you, then...
::'''Neko:''' Meow meow... It has been long since I spoke human language. It is such a tiring endeavor...

==Trivia==
*Neko may be the "old cat" mentioned in [[Hamayumi]], whose description is told from Hibiki's perspective.
*Neko is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item '[["Seal of the Provisional Head Priestess"]].'

===Etymology===
*{{Lang|Neko|ja=寝子|ja_rm=Neko|ja_tl=Sleeping Child}} is a pun on the Japanese word for "cat," which is {{Lang|mini=1|ja=猫|ja_rm=neko}}.
**In real life, it has been speculated that 寝子 is a possible etymological root for 猫.
*Her quest line {{Lang|"Neko Is a Cat"|ja=寝子は猫である|ja_rm=Neko wa Neko de Aru}} is most likely a reference to the Japanese novel {{Lang|''{{w|I Am a Cat}}''|ja=吾輩は猫である|ja_rm=Wagahai wa Neko de Aru}} written by {{w|Natsume Sōseki|Natsume Souseki}} in 1905–1906. The novel starts with the famous line "I am a cat. As yet I have no name." while the ''neko'' ("cat") in the game claims that she already has her name Neko ("Sleeping Child").
