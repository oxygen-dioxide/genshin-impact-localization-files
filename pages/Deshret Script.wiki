<section begin="Description" />The '''Deshret Script''' refers to the writing system found in the ruins in the [[Great Red Sand]].

This script seems to be based on the [[Teyvat Language|Teyvat alphabet]] and appears to be inspired by {{w|Egyptian hieroglyphs}}. This language is generally used to write {{w|Egyptian language|Egyptian}} words and sentences.<section end="Description" />

[[Sacred Seal]]s and [[Weathered Obelisk]]s are each marked with a character from the Deshret Script.
