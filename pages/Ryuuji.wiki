==Profile==
Ryuuji is a detective who works at the [[Bantan Sango Detective Agency]] as [[Sango|Sango's]] assistant. He used to be a Doushin but was framed and suspended from his job. After receiving Sango's help for free in resolving his false accusation case, Sango offered to take him in as her assistant. Because of his background as a Doushin, he is fairly capable of protecting himself in relatively dangerous investigations.<ref name="BSCF">{{Ref/Quest|Bantan Sango Case File}}</ref>

During investigations, he is responsible for gathering evidence and clues, and other physically intensive activities.<ref name="BSCF" /> He also scouts suspected areas to confirm Sango's deductions. He admits that his specialty lies in running errands and not stealth.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Bantan Sango Case File: Stealthy Trail}}</ref>

He once rescued [[Takeru]] from falling off a cliff, making him a hero in Takeru's eyes.

:{{DIcon}} About the commission...
::'''Ryuuji:''' Go talk to President Sango if it is about the commission's status. Leave the intel gathering to me. I will go where she tells me to.
::'''Ryuuji:''' You can call me Takeo or Ryuuji... Actually, never mind. Just call me Ryuuji.
::'''Ryuuji:''' Takeo is my real name, but President Sango thinks it isn't tough-sounding enough, so she insists on calling me Ryuuji. This does bother me... but I'll listen to her.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Are you busy?
:::'''Ryuuji:''' You've probably heard about Inazuma's current situation.
:::'''Ryuuji:''' Even the police... aren't fully reliable.
:::'''Ryuuji:''' If President Sango's responsibility is using her wits to solve cases, then my responsibility is to support her using my physical abilities. In short, due to the changing world, things are becoming complicated. We'll have to sort them out one by one.

:{{DIcon}} About President Sango...
::'''Ryuuji:''' Although President Sango has a short fuse, she is actually an upright person. You can trust her ability. When I was wrongly accused back in the day, she was the one who cleared my name.
::'''Ryuuji:''' I used to be a constable at the [[Police Station]]. Someone framed me, and I was suspended from my post. If it weren't for President Sango's amazing intelligence, I could not imagine how I would end up...
::'''Ryuuji:''' After the matters were taken care of, the president didn't even ask me for payment after seeing that I was broke. She even agreed to let me be her assistant.
::'''Ryuuji:''' Now, my name has been cleared, and I can work for President Sango. It's all the grace of the [[Electro Archon]]...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ryuuji:''' Let's talk again when we have a new lead. See you.

==Trivia==
* Although Ryuuji is not his real name, the name "Ryuuji" is consistently used by the game, even by people who knew Ryuuji before he met Sango and in legal documents like Ryuuji's Testimony, Conviction of Ryuuji, etc. This may suppose that the writers forgot about his real name Takeo, or Ryuuji legally changed his name after Sango had proved his innocence.
