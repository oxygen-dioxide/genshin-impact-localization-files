|text    = There was nothing for me to do today. So, I decided I would find a [[Wildlife#Crystalflies|Crystalfly]] for you &mdash; to put in your hair. I thought that... it would look nice.

The next thing I knew, I had caught several more than I intended. I hope you do not mind.

If you wish to meet me, speak my name.

...I do not care much for birthdays and celebrations, and I do not wish to be around large groups of people.

To be able to spend time with you is enough.
