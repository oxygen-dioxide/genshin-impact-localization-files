|description    = A flower vase of exceedingly good quality, it is placed at the doorstep of the [[Yashiro Commission Headquarters]]. This vase has seen quite a few years, and indeed none of the house retainers really know where it comes from. However, a professional would be able to tell that from the unique glazing it has, it must have come from before the era of the [[Sakoku Decree]] &mdash; it was purchased from [[Liyue]] at a rather high price long ago. That batch of porcelain work inspired many an Inazuman artisan and helped to usher in a new age in local art. As of today, [[Inazuma]] has long established its own unique culture of porcelain work.
