|vo_08_03_tx         = Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to "mortal" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha...

|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Tsaritsa.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Tsaritsa

|vo_08_05_tx         = Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world.

|vo_08_06_tx         = He was the first ever Fatui Harbinger, and today he is our leader. He only appears on important occasions. As for his accomplishments... To be honest, I don't really care. I owe my loyalty and devotion to the Tsaritsa, no one else.

|vo_08_07_tx         = I've seen him in battle before, and oh what a sight it was. Perhaps I'm ranked too low for him to notice me right now. Well, he may not recognize my strengths yet, but one day, I'll show him what I'm made of.

|vo_08_08_tx         = I heard that he took segments of himself at different ages, made prostheses out of them, and assigned different tasks to each one. I know... all my comrades are a little weird. Well, come to think of it, if I met another version of myself... Hah, we'd have to fight then and there to decide which one of us gets to survive.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Il Dottore

|vo_08_09_tx         = The Fatui Harbingers are ranked by strength, and I have no idea why that girl is No. 3. I'd test my skills with every Harbinger who ranks above me if I had the chance, but when it comes to her... something just doesn't feel right. Anyway, you should be careful around her.
|vo_08_09_mention    = Columbina

|vo_08_10_tx         = Look, I've got nothing against people who have their own agendas &mdash; I myself joined the Fatui to get more experience in combat. But I don't like her at all. If she stood to benefit from betraying others, she'd turn against the Tsaritsa in a heartbeat. There isn't a sane bone in her body.

|vo_08_11_tx         = I don't know what his motivations could be, but he seems genuine about wanting to help me. He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family &mdash; Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family.

|vo_08_14_tx         = I never got along with her, you know that. I guess there's not much more worth saying about her at this point. When you're a harbinger, you have to accept that death could come at any time... But don't worry about me. No matter what happens, I'll do whatever it takes to keep myself alive.

They are more enamored with their intangible methods, spending their days scheming and maneuvering. This is why we cannot get along.

I'm talking about things like, "I'm on fire!" That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs.

==Trivia==
*Tartaglia has more differences between his English voice lines and their official transcriptions than usual. Generally, the voiced lines match the original Chinese lines.
*Differences between language versions:
**'''More About Tartaglia - II:''' In Chinese, he is more openly disdainful towards the other Harbingers, saying "I can't get along with such boring folk."
**'''More About Tartaglia - III:''' In Chinese, he specifies "little brothers and sister" when he says "my siblings."
**'''Gliding:''' In Japanese, he says "悪くないね ''Warukunai ne''?" meaning "Not bad, huh?"
