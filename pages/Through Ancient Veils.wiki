==Trivia==
* {{Transclude|Embracing a Misty Sheen|MtLaixinTheme1|section=1}}
*The Chinese name of both this soundtrack and [[Embracing a Misty Sheen]] reference a poem by Yin Yaofan, recorded in the ''{{W|Complete Tang Poems}}''{{Lang|zh=全唐诗|zh_rm=Quántángshī}}. The poem{{Lang|zh=赠歌人郭婉二首|zh_tl=Two Poems in Dedication of Songgirl Guowan}} reads:
** {{zh|石家金谷舊歌人，起唱花筵淚滿巾。<br>紅粉少年諸弟子，一時惆悵望梁塵。<br>雲滿衣裳月滿身，輕盈'''歸步過流塵'''。<br>五更無限留連意，常恐風花又一春。}}<br>The old songgirl at the {{W|Shi Chong|Shi Family}}'s golden garden, you sang at the glorious feast till tears soaked your handkerchief,<br>The many rosy-cheeked youth disciples, at once were disconsolate watching your moving song.<br>Like clouds covering your clothes and the moon showering your body, '''your footsteps are lithe across the flying dust''',<br>Lingering at the cusp of dawn yet with infinite reluctance, with the fear that the blowing wind and withering flowers will take away another beautiful spring.
