==Personality==
{{Quote|The General Mahamatra in charge of supervising the researchers of the Akademiya. It is said that when he gets down to work, the General Mahamatra is even more sufficient than the "Great Vayuvyastra" made by the Kshahrewar.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Cyno is a curt, stoic and generally emotionless young man with a ruthlessness and vicious approach to his duty as a matra that make him intimidating and unapproachable. He cares little for niceties or social gatherings and is known throughout Sumeru for his ruthless efficiency at upholding the law.

Despite his young age, Cyno holds the position of General [[Matra|Mahamatra]] in the Akademiya and takes his position seriously. Cyno is extremely dedicated to upholding the Akademiya's rules and punishing any transgressions, to such an extent that even the [[Sumeru Akademiya#Academic Progression|sages]] of the Akademiya (ostensibly his superiors) are wary of him. Notoriously, Cyno will relentlessly pursue any individuals that try to flee his judgment, even across the desert &mdash; a trait that, in combination with his prowess as a hunter and warrior, makes escaping from Cyno nigh impossible. Due to this, Cyno's name is infamous within Sumeru and many scholars fear the prospect of ever meeting him, despite the fact that he only handles cases of significant interest.

Notably, Cyno idolizes "justice" above all; though this predominantly manifests in his pursuit of suspected criminals, Cyno will also protect criminals from any danger that arises during their escape attempts until they can, in his view, be properly judged by the Akademiya. Although he is often viewed by the Akademiya's scholars as an obstacle or a threat to their research (complaints to which Cyno is indifferent), Cyno views his role as that of a protector, preventing seekers of knowledge from being led astray and becoming dangers to both themselves and the world. However his being blessed with an Electro Vision suggests that his view of justice is closer to a desire to preserve the law, which he holds as eternal, rather than being interested in justice in and of itself.

Despite his seriousness in academics and work-related matters, Cyno is fairly relaxed outside of Akademiya duties, being an avid fan of [[Genius Invokation TCG]]. He shows concern for [[Collei]], frequently visiting her when he has the time to ensure that she's doing well, as well as harboring friendships with [[Tighnari]], [[Alhaitham]] and [[Kaveh]]. Despite his intentions to put people at ease, he maintains his emotionless, harsh attitude in most situations, even outside of work. Aware that his reputation as General Mahamatra often intimidates those around him (even his fellow Matras), Cyno tells jokes as a way to help people relax around him, though his jokes are generally unfunny and his long-winded attempts to explain them even more so.

Cyno also confesses to a fondness for the desert from which he hails, finding himself most at ease there and often taking nighttime strolls there to help himself relax.

==Appearance==

<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Cyno uses the [[:Category:Medium Male Characters|medium male]] model. He has tan skin, red-orange eyes, and medium-length gray hair.

===Manga===
Cyno is depicted wearing a large, black cape including a hood with what looks like jackal ears sewn on it. His cape seems to take inspiration from Northern Africa, showing some similarities with the large capes worn in the Sahara in order to avoid the heat, and to stay protected during sandstorms.

{{Quote|Many researchers at the [[Akademiya]] fear that the General Mahamatra will interfere with their research. However, it seems that they are worrying about nothing. Most of them do not produce results worthy of his visit.|A reply given by Forest Watcher [[Tighnari]] when [[Collei]] asked a question about the General Mahamatra.}}
If an Akademiya researcher is required to have a formal meeting with the General Mahamatra, Cyno, it usually does not bode well.

In general, a personal visit from Cyno implies that these researchers are perpetrators of serious academic offences: plagiarism, bribery, academic fraud, false declarations, misappropriation of funds, malicious competition, appropriation of someone else's dissertations, and more... The only thing left for these researchers to do is to follow the General Mahamatra and face disciplinary action.

But these researchers will not accept their sentence so easily.

Most of them try to bribe the General Mahamatra with Mora. These "wealthy people" will then be punished even more severely. Meanwhile, some choose to use force in an irrational act of recalcitrance... After paying the price for their defiance, they are subjected to a harsher sentence.

Others, at their wits' end, even feign madness, claiming memory loss or pleading insanity in a desperate attempt to escape punishment.

However, General Mahamatra Cyno has unfailing patience when dealing with these people. In his own words:

"As a Matra, it is one of my duties to help people 'remember' the mistakes they have made."

Nevertheless, researchers feel that this General Mahamatra does nothing but undermine academic progress and prohibit scientific research. Some even claim that he is "cutting off the path to knowledge" and can be seen as a dire threat to any researcher eager to seek knowledge...</p><!--
              --><p>Over time, researchers have come to shrink away from Cyno in silence whenever they so much as see him, wanting to have nothing to do with him.</p><!--

              --><p>In the history of the Akademiya, many researchers have used their "wisdom" to commit crimes.</p><!--
              --><p>For example, in order to test the limit of the Specters' body inflation, one [[Amurta]] researcher adopted an illegal catalyst and created a mega-sized [[Specter]], which later exploded during the experiment and leveled the entire research center. Then, there was a researcher from [[Spantamad]] who had aimed to test a Ruin Guard's ability to cultivate fields, but lost control of the modified machine, resulting in the ruin of many farmlands and grave injuries for several farmers. There have also been numerous criminal cases concerning academic fraud and the abuse of intelligence for personal gain...</p><!--
              --><p>Such researchers, who do not abide by the law and pose dangers to others, will all be pursued and judged by the Matra led by Cyno.</p><!--
              --><p>When they stand before the Matra, these researchers will almost always spare no effort to justify themselves. Their reasons have included but are not limited to suddenly cut funds, the Akademiya's favoritism towards other researchers, the results of their work being stolen... Some may even accuse the Matra of stopping them from completing their research out of jealousy of their talents.</p><!--
              --><p>Cyno's response to such sophistry is always to stay silent and press forward in subduing all those garrulous criminals and sending them to trial.</p><!--
              --><p>Those who violate the rules can always come up with a million excuses. However, only one ending awaits them.</p>

|text3         = <p>The name of the General Mahamatra has traveled well beyond the Akademiya's walls.</p><!--
              --><p>According to a [[Forest Watcher]] in the [[Avidya Forest]], he once caught a glimpse of this General Mahamatra quietly traveling through the woods in the middle of the night. A person living on the outskirts of [[Apam Woods]] can still clearly remember how a white-haired teenager asked them for a bowl of water, before venturing deep into the forest alone with just a traveling pack on his back. Adventurers resting in [[Sobek Oasis]] claim to have given directions to Cyno, though the area he was heading to had been packed with monsters. Even the proudest mercenaries and Treasure Hoarders in the Great Red Sand dare not make things difficult for the General Mahamatra, having learned this lesson well from the example of a mercenary group that was annihilated in the desert for sheltering wanted researchers.</p><!--
              --><p>However, for those criminals who have fallen into the hands of Cyno, their reverence for the General Mahamatra usually comes from another aspect of his character.</p><!--
              --><p>When escaping from the Akademiya, criminals tend to flee in an extreme panic, and can sometimes stray into perilous places. Yet, instead of letting them suffer the consequences, Cyno will come to their rescue without hesitation, just so that he can bring them back to the Akademiya to face their proper punishment.</p><!--
              --><p>Once, a criminal who had crossed the Great Red Sand with Cyno asked him about the point of doing all this. Cyno replied,</p><!--
              --><p>"Only the law can judge you, and my role here is to bring you to face the scales."</p><!--
              --><p>After being released from prison, the researcher, who had been a Vahumana graduate, turned their adventures returning to the Akademiya into a novel titled "The Goon," which remains a bestseller in the Akademiya. The researcher was even invited by Vahumana to give a lecture, during which they went into great detail about the portrayal of "justice" in the book.</p><!--
              --><p>If you ask Cyno, however, he would say that certain parts of the book were heavily exaggerated. In truth, they did not encounter any monsters created by the descendants of King Deshret, nor did they stray into a living labyrinth at the bottom of the desert or survive a sandstorm in the folds of a humongous sandworm.</p><!--
              --><p>Nevertheless, Cyno did appreciate the candidness with which the author described their own crimes, and would like to remind them to not commit such crimes ever again.</p>

              --><p>"I once worked on a case where the researcher involved was under great pressure because his paper had been rejected multiple times at the review stage. He eventually rammed it through by successfully bribing the members of his review committee. However, the data in that paper was so wrong that it didn't even take long to be exposed as academic fraud. When I went to arrest this researcher, he asked me 'what have I done wrong?'..."</p><!--
              --><p>After a pause, Cyno continued,</p><!--
              --><p>"I answered, 'Your paper.'"</p><!--
              --><p>Seeing the Matra all sit there in silence, Cyno seemed to be worried that they did not get the joke, so he went on to explain it with a serious expression,</p><!--
              --><p>"You see, the interesting part of this story lies in how, when he asked me what he had done wrong, he expected me to say that his fault lay with his bribing of the committee due to academic pressure, yet I told him that his error was in not reaching the correct conclusions in his paper. The clever part about this joke is that I changed the subject that was being discussed..."</p><!--
              --><p>After he finished explaining, the Matra all exchanged looks before letting out a few dry, strangled laughs in concert...</p><!--

              --><p>However, to prevent such an awkward situation from ever happening again, the Matra gradually came to a consensus that after Cyno finishes telling a joke, everyone in the room must force out a laugh or two in response so that he will not start explaining it.</p><!--
              --><p>On the other hand, any Matra who attempts to imitate Cyno's style will be harshly punished by the others through extreme means such as confiscating their canteen meal tickets.</p><!--

While he was reading the chapter on the sin of divulging secrets without a hint of fear, he failed to fathom some chunks of the content depicted in the book, so he closed his eyes and ruminated.

While Lisa was unable to read the document herself, she knew someone at Sumeru Akademiya who did and sent a letter to her former teacher regarding the matter.

Cyno was sent to handle the matter and arrived in Mondstadt three days later, just as Fatui personnel led by [[Barnabas]] arrived to retrieve their documents and apprehend the person who killed their diplomats &mdash; Collei.

==Trivia==
* Cyno is the first playable male {{Electro}} character to be released since [[Razor]] and shares several similarities with him:
** They share the same '''Lupus''' constellation name; Razor's case is that he was raised by wolves, while Cyno's headdress resembles that of Anubis, a jackal-headed deity, which are also related to wolves.
** Both have white hair and red eyes.
** Their Elemental Bursts cause them to be immune to Electro-Charged reactions, applies {{Electro}} to their attacks (although Razor still keeps his physical damage) and is invoked by calling a spirit within them.
* Many aspects of Cyno's overall design draw inspiration from the ''{{w|Yu-Gi-Oh!}}'' franchise:
** He is a fan of [[Genius Invokation TCG]], a card game similar to {{w|Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|Duel Monsters}}. He actively plays the TCG and owns his own deck of cards.
** One of his idle animations and his [[Featherfall Judgment]] icon both feature a prominent eye symbol resembling the one that appears on the franchise's various Millennium Items. Candace also features this eye symbol as part of her design.
** His Special Dish, [[Duel Soul]], is styled like the Millennium Puzzle, and shares its name with an OST from the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime series.
** [[Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness]] states that a spirit indwells his body and morphs him, similar to what the Pharaoh Atem does to Yugi throughout the anime.
** At Constellation Level 6, the Day of the Jackal effect creates Millennium Puzzle-like symbols around his body.
** He possesses an Egyptian-styled design, hearkening back to the original series of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!''
** In the Fukumoto quests, he's selected to be the model for the protagonist of "King of Invokations," a novel written by Fukumoto with a title strikingly similar to the title of Pharaoh Atem, the "King of Games."

* The English prefix {{wt|cyno-|cyno|English}} is derived from the Ancient Greek {{Lang|mini=1|grc=κύων|grc_rm=kúōn|grc_tl=dog,}} which could be a reference to the {{w|Anubis}}-like headdress.
