==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Washizu was the village chief of [[Higi Village]] until Watatsumi fanatics, who had infiltrated the [[Watatsumi Army]], broke the seals on [[Yashiori Island]], releasing [[Orobashi]]'s energy in the form of the [[Tatarigami]]. While he was initially unaffected, Washizu tried his best to maintain order in the village, which was taking in refugees from the mine as a result of the war. He had to lock up both their local pharmacist and [[Shingo]] after they had gone insane from the Tatarigami, before Washizu himself eventually became infected with it.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Tattered Paper (Washizu)}}</ref>

He began conducting human sacrifices for his god and left behind their possessions to draw unwary people in. At one point, he captured [[Chouji]]'s [[Chouji's Mother|mother]]; unlike the others, the Tatarigami flowed freely within her, but she escaped his custody, much to the god's anger and demanded he find her. Washizu tried with no success, before a Traveler arrived at his shrine and he told them to pray. After praying at the shrine for four days, Washizu snapped and attacked the Traveler, only to be slain in self-defence.

The [[Incomplete Register]] found in Higi Village reveals that after failing to acquire Chouji's mother, he attempted to use the Traveler as a sacrifice, referring to them as a "Nameless Outlander".

===Personality===
As the chief of Higi Village, Washizu was a kind person who sought to improve the villagers' well-being. When the "illness" struck, he was quick to accost [[Yasumoto]] of being a fraud for trying to comfort the people with a "remedy" of [[Lavender Melon]]s and [[Sweet Flower]]s. After being infected with Tatarigami, Washizu became insane and began praying to "him", even conducting human sacrifice to please his god. He originally passed off as a somewhat insane, yet reasonable zealot until he finally snapped from the god's supposed "disappointment" over his failure to sacrifice Chouji's mother.

===Appearance===
Washizu shares the same appearance as [[Kairagi: Dancing Thunder|Dancing Thunder Kairagi]].

==Trivia==
*Washizu's introduction dialogue for the day will be skipped if the Traveler prays at the shrine three times before speaking to him. Washizu will still repeat his introduction dialogue if the Traveler has only prayed once or twice.
*"That woman" that Washizu mentions on day 3 is implied to be Chouji's mother.
