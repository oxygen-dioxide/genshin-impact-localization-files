{{Description|A dried flower used as a bookmark, it had absorbed the scent from the pages.}}
'''Scholar's Bookmark''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Scholar]].

==Description==
Flowers were a rare sight for the scholar who lived in her ivory tower, buried under piles of books.<br />A young man who admired the scholar once gave her this exotic flower in the hope of bringing some life to the dull and lonely days she spent in her study.<br />The scholar accepted the gift gratefully and made a flower bookmark with it.<br />Ever since then there has always been a splash of vivid color hidden somewhere in the pages of the dull piles of books.
