'''Game Systems''' refer to subsystems within ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that the player can interact with, usually to aid in [[Exploration]], [[Combat]], [[Progression]], and leveling up [[characters]] and equipment.

==Exploration==
[[File:Common Chest.png|200px|thumb|right|[[Chests|Common Chest]] at the beginning point]]
{{Main|Exploration}}
During [[Exploration]], players can encounter various puzzles and [[obstacles]], as well as unlock new regions of the [[Teyvat]] map via [[Statues of The Seven]]. Players can travel between the various unlocked regions using [[Teleport Waypoints]].

Teyvat has its own laws and physics, including [[Time]], [[Weather]], and [[Climate]]. Certain character [[Talents]] and abilities like [[Sprinting]], [[Swimming]], and [[Climbing]] will also aid the player as they traverse the world of Teyvat.

Special objects can be collected while exploring that can unlock new treasures and upgrades for the player:
*[[Oculi]]: collect enough and one can upgrade the statue of the seven, increasing one's [[Stamina]]
*[[Sigils]]: can be exchanged at shops for weapon billets, crystals, [[Mora]] and other rewards.
*[[Shrines of Depths]] keys: can be used to unlock shrines where players can receive treasures.

During exploration, players will encounter various contraptions, usually as part of puzzles, challenges, and other obstacle courses. They can ride [[Wind Currents]] to ascent into the sky or unlock [[Chests]] by activating [[Elemental Monument]]s or [[Pressure Plate]]s.

==Combat==
{{Main|Combat}}

While exploring the world, players will have to battle [[enemies]], which can introduce new systems of mechanics. When walking within the vicinity of an enemy camp, enemies will be [[Aggravation|aggravated]] and begin attacking the player. To challenge harder enemies and defeat them more swiftly, players can level up their own [[Attributes]] and [[Constellations]], increasing how much [[Damage]] they do and unlocking new combat skills such as [[Elemental Infusion]]s, [[Shields]], and [[Healing]] to aid them in battle.

Combat and the [[Elements]] are governed by their own physics as well, including [[Elemental Reactions]], [[Elemental Resonance]], [[Interruption Resistance]] and [[Elemental Gauge Theory]].

==Crafting==

To help with exploration and combat, players can craft various materials via the following systems:
*[[Alchemy]]: for [[potions]], character ascension materials, talent ascension materials, weapon ascension materials. Alchemy is performed at [[Crafting Benches]].
*[[Cooking]]: for [[food]] to heal players in battle or boost their offense and defense
*[[Creation]]: a special crafting system within the [[Serenitea Pot]] housing system, used to create new [[furnishings]]
*[[Forging]]: for new [[weapons]]. This can be done at blacksmith shops such as [[Schulz's Blacksmith]] and [[Master Zhang]]'s shop

==Domains==

{{Main|Domains}}
Players will also unlock new [[domains]] which provide localized arenas for players to gain access to new artifacts or materials or progress in Story Quests and complete challenges. Some domains, including the [[Spiral Abyss]], will grant special [[Auras]] to enemies or inflict [[Ley Line Disorders]] to modify the battlefield. Many [[Events]] may also have their own special domains that have unique Ley Line Disorders or challenge restrictions as well.

==Quests==
{{Main|Quests}}[[File:UI Quest.png|175px|thumb|right|[[Quests|Quests Interface]]]]
During quests and [[commissions]], players may have to complete special challenges like defending [[Ley Line Monolith]]s, escorting [[Transport Balloon]]s, or destroying [[Slime Balloon]]s.

==Gameplay Modes==
Some quests will also launch the player in unique gameplay modes like [[Stealth]] where the objective is to avoid enemy detection or capture a certain target. Some events will also initiate different gameplay modes, like the [[Windtrace]] hide-and-seek game mode, where the player is either the hunter or rebel, or the various minigames featured in the [[Windblume Festival]], including the music simulator and gliding minigames.

At the beginning of the Traveler's journey, they are thrown into a flying simulator gameplay mode: a gliding battle with [[Dvalin]] where the objective is to take down the dragon by aiming at its poisoned clot.

The multiplayer mode is called [[Co-Op Mode]], where up to 4 players can be in the same world at a time, where the 4 total number of characters in the party is split between each player.
