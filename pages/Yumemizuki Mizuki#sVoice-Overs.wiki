When I first became a shareholder, I had a vision for a new kind of clinical practice &mdash; having patients soak in medicinal baths to relax the mind and body before treatment.<br>But, well... Most of the time, the warm water put people to sleep before I could even get to the clinical part. After waking up, they would praise my methods and call me a miracle worker.<br>Even though, I didn't even do anything! It just goes to show what rest can do...<br>A simple good night's sleep can solve a lot of problems, actually. And, still, people insist on pushing themselves to the breaking point.<br>*sigh* I just wish people would listen when their body tells them to rest...

Sweet dreams are precious treasures, and their absence can trigger a sense of loss and emptiness.<br>But, you seem to be an exception.  Your dreams are like a bottomless treasure trove.

And, based on what I've heard, many people without a Vision are waiting on the same miracle to happen to them.<br>But, dreaming of something unobtainable often means setting yourself up for greater disappointment, especially when you wake up, and reality sets in.<br>Sometimes, in the pursuit of a mirage, we inadvertently turn reality into a nightmare from which we must escape...

I miss those days sometimes &mdash; Miko had just learned to transform into a human, and life was so simple... Every day, she would come find me and let me taste her dreams.<br>Notes of sakura blossom, paper, ink, [[Tricolor Dango]], and Fried Tofu... That's what I remember. She would beg me to transform into a human with her and drag me into town to find things that matched the flavors of her dreams. If someone caught us, we would immediately transform back into our original forms, and make a break for it. Miko ran so fast, she would leave me in the dust half the time.

Who knows if any of the flavors are the same as back then...<br>Consuming dreams without permission is the ultimate taboo for my kind. Even if she came to me and asked after so long, I...

As she settled into the pool, a strand of her hair drifted into the water. I thought about reaching out to fix it, but I was worried it would be too casual a gesture for such a noble figure. Of course, I doubt Miko would even hesitate... It's an unfortunate reminder that I still have a long way to go as a youkai.

Yes, she is quite memorable.<br>Every once in a while, I perform a mental health survey to see if there are areas around Inazuma where people are more likely to need treatment...<br>It turns out, those who live near Miss Yoimiya have need very little, and I doubt that's a coincidence.

Her [[Kamisato Ayato|brother]] once enlisted my services in secret, hoping to alleviate some of her anxieties.<br>What I remember of her dream... was the smell of old timber and heavy rain, like a lone, wooden pavilion on the verge of collapse amid a storm. I did my best to treat her, until she finally fell into a peaceful slumber.<br>Many years have passed since then.

It's not uncommon to see doubt and fear in their minds, but her mindscape is always cold, hard metal. No rain, no sun &mdash; like a safe of pure [[Jade Steel]], unflinching and impenetrable.<br>I have a lot of respect for her because of that.<br>Although, I can only imagine what resilience it took to get to that point...

I lived with the People of the Springs during my time in Natlan, and I never could have opened up my shop there without her help. She dragged me to the [[Speaker's Chamber]], and just like that, I was face-to-face with the Pyro Archon with no warning at all, scared out of my mind...<br>Her personality is like a wave, sometimes cresting high above the water, gliding deep beneath the surface, or even crashing straight against the shore.

Our neighbor, the [[Kitsune Saiguu]], sacrificed herself in that disaster. I was devastated, but helpless to stop it... It was seeing all that loss and despair that inspired me to go into this vocation.

I used to think I would spend my whole life facing this alone, until I met you... someone who can turn the world on its head, who can bend the will of the gods themselves...

|vo_13_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Feelings About Ascension - 04.ogg
|vo_13_04_tx         = Negative emotions are a part of who we are. Anxiety, agitation, and fear are what result when we shy away from facing them head-on. The important thing is finding the balance between recognizing those emotions and being overwhelmed by them. You helped me find that balance, and now, it's cemented in my head. No matter how toxic or poisonous the nightmare, I have nothing to fear.
