|description    = Mushrooms with strange shapes that present as a deep scarlet. The fungal stipes of these mushrooms are much tougher than their slender appearance might suggest, being able to hold the weighty mushroom cap up quite well, only waving a little even amidst strong winds. It is for this reason that it has gained the appellation "Swayshroom."
