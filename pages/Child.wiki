==Trivia==
* It is unclear whether the child in [[Skeletal Hat]] is the same as this child. While both boys were the children of Tatarasuna craftspeople and both were ill, Skeletal Hat writes that the next time Scaramouche stepped foot on Tatarasuna, the boy was nowhere to be found, which contradicts the idea of the two living together and Scaramouche caring for the boy.
