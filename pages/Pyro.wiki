'''{{Pyro}}''' is one of the seven [[Elements]].

Its associated [[Archon]] is [[Mavuika|Haborym]], whose domain is [[Natlan]].

==Elemental Resonance==
Having at least two Pyro characters in a party of four results in the [[Elemental Resonance]]:
*'''Fervent Flames:''' Affected by Cryo for 40% less time. Increases ATK by 25%.

==Elemental Reactions==
{{Pyro}} has the following [[Elemental Reactions]]:

*{{Icon/Element|Electro}} '''[[Overloaded]]:''' Causes an explosion that deals {{Color|Pyro DMG}} with high [[knockback]].
*{{Icon/Element|Hydro}} '''[[Vaporize]]:''' Deals ×1.5 {{Color|Pyro DMG}} when a Pyro attack triggers the reaction.
*{{Icon/Element|Cryo}} '''[[Melt]]:''' Deals ×2 {{Color|Pyro DMG}} when a Pyro attack triggers the reaction.
*{{Icon/Element|Anemo}} '''[[Swirl]]:''' Deals {{Color|Pyro DMG}} while spreading the Pyro status to nearby enemies.
*{{Icon/Element|Geo}} '''[[Crystallize]]:''' Creates a Pyro shard. Picking it up creates a Pyro [[Shield]] around the character.
*{{Icon/Element|Dendro}} '''[[Burning]]:''' Deals {{Color|Pyro DMG}} at intervals in a small radius around the target and applies Pyro.
*{{Icon/Element|Dendro}}{{Icon/Element|Hydro}} '''[[Burgeon]]:''' Detonates a Dendro Core produced by the [[Bloom]] reaction immediately, dealing increased {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.

==Pyro Status==
Being affected by {{Pyro}} has no inherent effects on its own. However, being affected by {{Pyro}} will allow Pyro Elemental Reactions to occur.

Any source of {{Color|Pyro DMG}} will apply the {{Pyro}} status. [[Flaming Flower Stamen|Flaming Flowers]] and Pyro Boom Blossoms do not inherently apply {{Pyro}}, but are often surrounded by grass and will inflict Burning damage. Any lit torch, campfire, or cooking pot will cause Burning damage if the active character comes too close to them.

===Pyro Status to Self===
The following [[Talents]] apply {{Pyro}} to its user and/or the active character.

===Etymology===
*The name Pyro comes from the prefix for words related to fire, "{{wt|pyro-|pyro-|English}}," which derives from {{lang|the Ancient Greek word for fire|grc=πῦρ|grc_rm=pûr}}.
