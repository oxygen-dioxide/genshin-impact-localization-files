{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Freeman:''' ...I have no plans for you, my child. You're free to pursue what you like.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a bit about yourself...
::'''Freeman:''' Me? I'm just a nobody, don't worry about me. Come, have a drink.
::'''Freeman:''' Regardless of what brought you here, surely it's worth having a drink to celebrate our meeting on this ship?
::'''Freeman:''' To celebrate being able to see the sky and the sea every day!
::{{DIcon}} You can see it?
::'''Freeman:''' To see truly wonderful things, you must look with your mind, not your eyes.
::'''Freeman:''' ...Drunk talk, my child.
::'''Freeman:''' Believe me, try looking from this angle, and you might just see things differently.
;(If the player has completed ''[[Free Verse]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About Penny...
::'''Freeman:''' Ah, young Penny! She must trust you quite a bit, if she's willing to introduce you to her animal friends.
::'''Freeman:''' What're they called again?
::{{DIcon}} Don Quijano.
:::'''Freeman:''' Yep, that's a name that reeks of Rouge. Like a swordsman's.
:::'''Freeman:''' That Tiger-Striped Cat is really something! Ah, when those enemies chased us all the way to Poisson...
:::'''Freeman:''' Jumping out like some kind of great hero, scratching their faces to ribbons! Haha, such a brave, loyal cat.
::{{DIcon}} Nana.
:::'''Freeman:''' Oh, yeah. I remember that's the name of Autumn's dog.
:::'''Freeman:''' This dog's too delicate. Grew up in the city, after all, and not used to life in the wild.
:::'''Freeman:''' I was shocked the first time I heard Autumn say she liked to pick out clothes and necklaces for the dog when she was young.
:::'''Freeman:''' So rich that even the dog wears necklaces.

:{{DIcon}} About Autumn...
::'''Freeman:''' The poor girl... Such a shame that you had to meet like that.
::'''Freeman:''' In fact, she has a good heart. I hope she can be happy.
;(If the player has completed ???)
:{{DIcon}} About Rouge...
::'''Freeman:''' "To see truly wonderful things, you must look with your mind, not your eyes."
::'''Freeman:''' Guess who told me that?
::'''Freeman:''' Haha, he's a funny guy, and a good friend.
-->
:{{DIcon}} Until next time.
::'''Freeman:''' Until next we meet, my child.
::'''Freeman:''' Truth is always marching onward, and nothing can stop it! Cheers!
