'''Arama''' is an [[Aranara]] and quest-exclusive [[NPC]] located in [[Vanarana]], [[Sumeru]]. He first appears in [[The World of Aranara|''The World of Aranara'']] quest where he watches the [[Traveler]] approach the [[Phantasmal Gate]] in Vanarana and later meets them when they entered "their world" by using the [[Vintage Lyre]].<ref><small>World Quest, Aranyaka: Part II - Dream Nursery: ''[[The World of Aranara]]''</small></ref>

In ''[[For All Children Who Long for Life]]'', Arama becomes a seed and grows into a new [[Ashvattha Tree]], allowing the Traveler to obtain the [[Bija]].
