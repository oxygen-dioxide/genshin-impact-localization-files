===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

==Strategy==
*The Mirror Maiden can apply the Refraction debuff onto the player with her waterwheel attack. Once active, all Mirror Maidens in battle will enter the Polarization state. The Refraction debuff can only be removed by one of the player's characters falling or by defeating one Mirror Maiden.
**The Refraction debuff is displayed as 4 small mirror shards on the player forming a target pattern.
**The Polarization state is shown by many small mirror shards floating around the Mirror Maiden.
**While in the Polarization state, the Mirror Maiden cannot be staggered, and is immune to [[Vacuum Field|vacuum fields']] displacement effects. Instead of attempting to knock them back, attempt to trigger the [[Frozen]] reaction, stunning them.
**The debuff is removed when one of the player's characters falls and when leaving combat for an extended period of time. It is also removed if a Mirror Maiden is defeated.
**The debuff can be avoided by dashing through the attacks that inflict it, taking advantage of its [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]] to evade both damage and the debuff, but Elemental Burst animation's i-frames will evade the damage, but not the debuff.
**If the Refraction status is applied by one Mirror Maiden, all Mirror Maidens in battle will enter the Polarization state. Similarly, in co-op mode, one player having the Refraction status is a sufficient condition for all Mirror Maidens in battle to enter the Polarization state.
*The Glass Cage can be avoided the same way as the [[Auras#Damage Abilities|Ice Cage]]: a well-timed sprint dash can prevent the current character from getting trapped. It is also possible to use skills which allow the player to dash or teleport out of the cage.
*Like the Fatui Pyro Agent, the Mirror Maiden also lacks a shield.

==Locations==
Mirror Maiden locations can be pinpointed on the map by using the [[Adventurer Handbook]]. There is also a timed challenge to defeat two in 60 seconds just outside of [[Inazuma City]].
