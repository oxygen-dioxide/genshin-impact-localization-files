==Notable Features==
===Exploration===
* [[Subzero Climate]]
** All of Dragonspine is affected by Subzero Climate. [[Grass]] does not burn, and players can gain the Sheer Cold gauge. Traveling in [[Subzero Climate#Colder Locations|certain parts]] of Dragonspine or [[swimming]] will accelerate [[Subzero Climate#Accumulation Rate|Sheer Cold accumulation]]. When the Sheer Cold gauge is full, the active character [[Subzero Climate#HP Loss|loses HP]] over time. Players can mitigate or avoid the effects of Sheer Cold with [[Goulash]] and [[Subzero Climate#Sources of Warmth|sources of warmth]].
* [[Ancient Rime]]s
** [[Ancient Rime]]s are unique blocks of ice with patterns on them that cannot be melted with {{Pyro}} attacks. Only by breaking a nearby [[Scarlet Quartz]] ore vein and imbuing oneself with its power will one be able to break Ancient Rime. The power dissipates after 25s and the ore vein regenerates after 15s.
* Ice Blocks
** Throughout Dragonspine, there are small blocks of ice scattered all over the area. These can be melted with {{Pyro}}, which often results in something appearing from them:
*** A [[Large Cryo Slime]]
*** A [[Cryo Whopperflower]]
*** Two [[Wildlife#Crystalflies|Cryo Crystalflies]]
*** A [[Wildlife#Weasels|Snow Weasel]]

==Lore==
This is Dragonspine, an enormous mountain that holds the remains of the venomous dragon, Durin, who fell here after the battle with [[Dvalin]]. Few adventurers dare attempt to conquer this unforgiving environment marked by deep snow, sheer cold, poisonous blood, and monsters. But such things will not dissuade the star-faring Traveler from journeying here...<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/dzpmNU8WJVg Version 1.2 "The Chalk Prince and the Dragon" Trailer]</ref>

[[Albedo]] suspects that the sword [[Festering Desire]] is related to the dragon Durin, and may draw its power from the dragon's venom.

===Before Durin===
Long before Durin's fall, there existed a civilization called [[Sal Vindagnyr]] on the mountain. Much of its archaeological remains are centered on the [[Entombed City - Ancient Palace]]. There are also records contained on [[Ancient Carvings]]; and in the descriptions of the weapon [[Snow-Tombed Starsilver]], as well as the catalyst [[Frostbearer]]; and of the [[Princess' Box]], [[Priest's Box]], and [[Scribe's Box]]; as well as frescos within the [[Mural Room]] where the Snow-Tombed Starsilver is found.

Together they tell of a kingdom, a princess gifted with the power to foretell through visions and painting, and of a tragedy or fall of that kingdom. The fall is brought about by the [[Skyfrost Nail]] which falls and destroys the silver ley line tree on the mountain- this causes the change in climate from verdant to frostbitten. Artifacts found in Dragonspine tell the story of the Princess and people of that time, and the story of an outlander entrusted with the Starsilver weapon &mdash; when the outlander returns from his quest he finds the city dead and abandoned, and leaves the weapon in the secret chamber.

The decoded messages ("[[Record of Serial No.]]") found on broken [[Ruin Guard]]s in the region may also be related, but also may relate to the fall of [[Khaenri'ah]], from where Ruin Guards originate.

==Trivia==
* Much of Dragonspine's story, lore, and history were deliberately left ambiguous to allow players to develop their own interpretations of what happened. In [https://youtu.be/u8kzvjRDGOM?t=230 "Snow-Covered Path" &mdash; Behind the Scenes of Dragonspine] (3:50 – 4:37), open world level designer Xiao Ao says, ''"To enrich the experience of the Dragonspine story, we would take the core themes of Dragonspine &mdash; namely the Skyfrost Nail and the bygone civilization &mdash; and represent them from many angles. [...] In the end, the player develops their own interpretation of what happened."''
* Dragonspine's peak is modelled after the iconic shape of the {{w|Matterhorn}} in the Alps.
* Before Version 1.2, Dragonspine was actually a subarea belonging to [[Windwail Highland]] in-game, though players couldn't reach Dragonspine under normal conditions.
** If the player reached Dragonspine from some methods (for example, being knocked back incorrectly by some enemies) before Version 1.2, the word "Dragonspine" would appear on the screen, like other subareas.
