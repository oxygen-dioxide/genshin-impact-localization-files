|description    = A giant plate seen in [[Sumeru City]]'s jewelry shop. Although it is "only" a dining plate, it is large enough to hold an entire [[Shroomboar]] and five servings of fish rolls and still have room to spare. As it's extremely difficult to find a table big enough to hold it, using this plate to serve patrons is not very practical. Of course, its high price tag is also quite daunting for anyone who wishes to get their hands on it.<br />Due to the magnificent, well-preserved, and peerless patterns on its surface, it has become a rare collector's item and is often displayed prominently in the shop as a key piece of decor...
