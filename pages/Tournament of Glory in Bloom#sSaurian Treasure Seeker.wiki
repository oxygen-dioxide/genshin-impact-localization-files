|An expedition team has set off in search of Ocean Zephyrs. However, a few enthusiastic yet clueless young saurians also want to help out.

==Tutorial==
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Tournament of Glory in Bloom Saurian Treasure Seeker 1.png
|text1  = In "Saurian Treasure Seeker," you must switch the {{Color|BP|indicated direction}} at various intersections to plan a route, thus leading the saurian whelps onward to accomplish the stages' treasure hunt objectives.
|image2 = Tutorial Tournament of Glory in Bloom Saurian Treasure Seeker 2.png
|text2  = You can move the camera to explore areas off to the sides. Select the Reset View button to return to the center so you can keep following the little saurian.
|image3 = Tutorial Tournament of Glory in Bloom Saurian Treasure Seeker 3.png
|text3  = Different saurian whelps have {{Color|BP|favorable terrain}} unique to them. Traversing favorable terrain will {{Color|BP|increase their movement speed}}, while traversing unfavorable terrain will {{Color|BP|decrease their movement speed}}. Switch saurians out where necessary!
|image4 = Tutorial Tournament of Glory in Bloom Saurian Treasure Seeker 4.png
|text4  = Press the Sprint button to allow a saurian whelp to briefly perform an {{Color|BP|accelerated sprint}} that ignores unfavorable terrain. A saurian whelp will also execute an accelerated sprint if you switch to it while on its {{Color|BP|favorable terrain}}.
}}

;Collection Stages
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Tournament of Glory in Bloom Saurian Treasure Seeker Collection Stages 1.png
|text1  = In collection stages, you must direct the saurian whelps to collect the specified number of Precious Grainfruit. {{Color|BP|Magma}} will rain down on the field at intervals, dealing DMG to creatures within its AoE when the warning zone is fully lit. A saurian whelp will lose Vitality if hit, so take evasive maneuvers.
}}

;Infiltration Stages
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Saurian Treasure Seeker Infiltration Stages 1.png
|text1  = In infiltration stages, you must direct the saurian whelps to seize all the treasure chests in the area. {{Color|BP|Patrolling opponents}} will also be present, and a saurian whelp will lose Vitality if discovered by them. You can view the opponents' movement paths when planning your route at an intersection
|image2 = Tutorial Saurian Treasure Seeker Infiltration Stages 2.png
|text2  = Some {{Color|BP|hiding spots}} are available in the area. A saurian whelp can activate one by passing through it. If discovered by an opponent, the whelp will seek shelter at the {{Color|BP|previous}} hiding spot and will head out again upon choosing a direction.
}}

;Wrathful Volcanoes
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Saurian Treasure Seeker Wrathful Volcanoes 1.png
|text1  = Wrathful volcanoes present within stages will erupt {{Color|BP|in a specific direction or all directions}} at intervals, dealing DMG to creatures within their AoE when the warning zone is fully lit. Track their actions and evade accordingly.
}}

;Watchtowers
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Saurian Treasure Seeker Watchtowers 1.png
|text1  = {{Color|BP|Watchtowers}} are present within the area, and the opponents atop them will {{Color|BP|change their surveying direction}} at intervals. A saurian whelp within their surveillance zone will be discovered. Be careful when planning your route and be sure to avoid them.
}}

;Intermittent Tides
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Saurian Treasure Seeker Intermittent Tides 1.png
|text1  = Intermittent tides wash over the stage, causing some areas to switch between land and water-type terrain at intervals. Take measure of the situation and dispatch the saurian whelp most suited to the task...
