|description  = A strange, rare ore that was mined from [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]].<br>These rocks can only be found in the ore veins of the oldest mountains. It is so rare that most merchants have probably never heard of it.<br>However, the changes in The Chasm have led to the emergence of much low-quality Archaic Stone, a fact that has given the merchants of [[Huishan Hall]] quite the headache.
