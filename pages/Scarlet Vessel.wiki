==Description==
With his secret sword technique, Tengu Sweeper, [[Iwakura Michihiro]] became the [[Kujou Clan]]'s swordsmanship instructor.<br>He also received the title of "Douin" and founded [[Iwakura Clan|a successful sword school]].<br>As he headed off to take up his post at the Kujou Estate, Michihiro, who had long learned how to drink,<br>Stepped into the branch shrine that had been utterly destroyed by his completion of the Tengu Sweeper.<br>Here, in the courtyard of this abandoned branch shrine, he had sparred with the Tengu of Yougou thirteen times in the last thirteen years.<br>He remembered his encounter with the black-winged tengu who had called herself "[[Teruyo]] of Yougou"...

Thirteen years went by like a dream<br>The scarlet snow flies through the shadowed pass like smoke<br>You have now gone afar

The [[Sacred Sakura]] [[Sakura Bloom|petals]] fell then, too, as if they were snow from the sky.<br>The branch shrine had lost the god it worshipped, but it was still in a fine state.<br>Laughter as clear as spring water echoed between the mountains.<br>But never again would the two set foot in that desolate yard.
