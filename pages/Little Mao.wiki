{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If Little Mao is in Qiaoying Village)
:'''Little Mao:''' Wait for me to come back. Once I do, I'll tell you Big Sis Fujin's story!
:{{DIcon}} Don't sneak into the mountains by yourself. It's dangerous.
::'''Little Mao:''' I know. Uncle Luo and Grandpa Lu always say that too, but... Hehe, they can't keep an eye on me all the time, can they?
::'''Little Mao:''' The mountains really aren't that dangerous. Bluey and Big Sis Fujin are there too. It's been a while since I've played with Bluey, too.
::'''Little Mao:''' I wanted to introduce Grandpa Lu to Bluey earlier, but she said that wasn't a good idea, so I dropped the idea.
:{{DIcon}} They're both adepti, so I'm sure everything will be fine.
::'''Little Mao:''' Really? But... if they're fine, why couldn't I find Bluey anywhere when I went to play in the mountains after that, then?
::'''Little Mao:''' I walked along the river for ages, eating several large fruits and getting hungry two or three times along the way, but I couldn't find her anywhere. In the end, I lay down next to a giant tree and fell asleep. It was in my dream that I saw her.
::'''Little Mao:''' She told me to eat until I was full after waking up and then go home first because she was busy with something.
::'''Little Mao:''' After I woke up, I ate the fruits Bluey left next to me and then went home like she told me to...
::'''Little Mao:''' Bluey didn't tell me what she was busy with... but maybe I can help her!
::{{DIcon}} Wait, Bluey gave you fruits?
::'''Little Mao:''' Yes. There was a big pile of fruits next to me when I woke up. Some were sweet, and some were sour, and some were really difficult to bite into. Oh, some of them spurted juice all over my clothes when I bit them. Fortunately, I was next to a river, so I could wash my clothes there.
::'''Little Mao:''' *sigh* I wonder when Bluey will finish with whatever she's doing. I miss her and Big Sis Fujin...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Little Mao:''' Bye! Remember to say hello for me if you see Bluey and Big Sis Fujin, alright?
