{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ruta:''' [[Mt. Yougou]], was it? Ugh, it sure looks quite high from here...
:{{DIcon}} The mountain paths are tough to tread.
::'''Ruta:''' I agree. Now, if I was swimming, it would be easy, no matter how far, but these steep mountain slopes...
::'''Ruta:''' Though I've heard the locals say there are shrine maidens on Mt. Yougou. Shrine maidens are known to be skilled diviners, and that's all the incentive I need for the climb.
::'''Ruta:''' I'm hoping for "Great Fortune"! I'm not quite sure what it represents, but I hear it's the best result possible.
::'''Ruta:''' My luck's always been good. As long as I can make it up this mountain, I know there'll be great news waiting for me at the top!
:{{DIcon}} You'll be up there in a flash.
::'''Ruta:''' Really? Just like those friends from the [[Scions of the Canopy]]? Do you think I can climb like them?
::'''Ruta:''' Hmm... I guess there's only one way to find out...
::'''Ruta:''' Tell you what, I think I've got it. I'll explore the area a little first, then make my way up Mt. Yougou one step at a time!
::'''Ruta:''' Oh, I almost forgot. I saw someone carrying a [[Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder|puppet]] just now. It was styled like a [[Raiden Shogun|captivating young woman]] holding a sword &mdash; and it was so beautiful, too! I must find out where I can buy one...
:{{DIcon}} I wish you the best of luck.
::'''Ruta:''' Thank you! One can never have too much luck!
