{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If [[Stones, Coconuts, and Saurian Traffickers]] has not been completed)
:;(Approach the campsite)
::'''Fiendish Fellow:''' Huh? Where'd this dumb kid crawl out from? Can't you see we're busy? Scram!
::'''Fiendish Fellow:''' Wait a minute... We've got a great thing going here, and it feels like you're trying to ruin it! This is our livelihood, y'know, and it pays good [[Mora]]!
::'''Paimon:''' What "livelihood"? You jumped out and threatened us, and even attacked!
::'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, we can't let them bully us! Let's just hit 'em right back!

:;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders){{Verify|dialogue definitely obtained, but unsure of condition}}
::'''[[Oeno|Boss of the Baddies]]:''' What're you getting all up in a twist over? It's just a dumb kid and their pet...
::'''Boss of the Baddies:''' Seeing as you're standing in the way of our profits, I'm afraid that I, "Oeno, the Gilded Dragonclaw," have no other choice but to send you to your demise.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon hasn't the slightest idea what you're on about, but she can tell you're a bad apple just from looking!

:;(After defeating Oeno)
::'''Paimon:''' He{{sic}} sure is quick to run!
::'''Paimon:''' Bah, forget it. let's{{sic}} save these animals first!

:;(Approach the caged Saurians)
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Why are there Saurians in the cages here?
::'''Paimon:''' Something's not right here... Wait. Could they all have been captured by those people?
::'''Paimon:''' Have we busted some kinda Saurian trafficking ring without even realizing it?
::{{DIcon}} Wonderful! Villains vanquished, by the by!
:::'''Paimon:''' That's right! Now let's get all these Saurians outta here!
::{{DIcon}} Doesn't matter. We took those villains out either way.
:::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, it matters a lot &mdash; that the kidnapped Saurians can now regain their freedom, that is. Let's help them, pronto!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(If [[Stones, Coconuts, and Saurian Traffickers]] has been completed)
:;(Approach the campsite)
::'''Demoralized Saurian Trafficker:''' Oh no, that walking, talking wrecking ball and {{MC|m=him|f=her}} two pets are back!
::'''Demoralized Saurian Trafficker:''' Quick, stall {{MC|m=him|f=her}} and get the boss over here!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers now, you're that bunch of Saurian traffickers who hurt King Coconut before!
::'''Paimon:''' You... so this is where you ran off to!

:;(After defeating the first wave of enemies)
::'''Oeno:''' Are you serious!? You three, again?
::'''Oeno:''' Don't you ever give up? Why do you have to keep getting between us and money?

:;(After defeating Oeno)
::'''Oeno:''' Are you... kidding me...
::'''Paimon:''' {{sic|He|expected=She}} finally got what {{sic|he|expected=she}} deserved... <!-- Similarly to Stones, Coconuts and Saurian Traffickers, the pronouns used for the Iktomisaurus Warrior: Cryocrystal Cannons are incorrect here. -->
::'''Paimon:''' Alright, we should be able to rescue all the animals they hurt this time!

:;(Approach the caged saurians)
::'''Paimon:''' Sure enough, there are still some Saurians locked up here...
::'''Paimon:''' Who'd have thought they'd persist in their wicked ways and keep hurting Saurians, even after we destroyed their base...
::'''Paimon:''' Had we known, we could've chased them down and wiped them all out.
::{{DIcon}} Well, they're all done for now.
:::'''Paimon:''' True. Now let's save 'em, quick!
::{{DIcon}} Yes, I should've been cold and cruel back then!
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon can hardly imagine you being like that, {{Traveler}}... Anyway, let's help 'em first!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Open the cage door on either the [[Qucusaurus Chick]] or [[Koholasaur Whelp]] first) <!-- No additional dialogue for opening the second cage (either the Qucusaur Chick or Koholasaur Whelp's) -->
:'''Paimon:''' It's okay, don't be scared, it's okay now. You can all go home!

;(Approach the cart)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} Zzz...

;(Open the door on the cart)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, there's a... Blubberbeast in here? How in the world&mdash;? Guess bad guys really will sell anything...
:'''Victimized Blubberbeast:''' Awrr... Bluboo!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rroo... Mrrooh!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? You're kinda interested in the Blubberbeast, aren't you, {{Little One}}?
:{{Black Screen|{{Little One}} listens intently to the cries of the Blubberbeast and, seemingly understanding something, lifts the creature by the tail to take it over to the shallows, where they play together.}}
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:{{DIcon}} The Blubberbeast seems chuffed.
:{{DIcon}} {{Little One}} seems pretty happy, too.
:'''Paimon:''' Sure does! Maybe they can become friends?
:'''Paimon:''' But that Blubberbeast doesn't seem to have the slightest bit of strength, and its two... Err, paws...? Either way, they don't seem able to flap around much.
:'''Paimon:''' There wasn't even a plate of food around... Perhaps they've been locked up so long that they're starving.
:'''Paimon:''' If that's so, let's make something for the Blubberbeast and {{Little One}} to eat!

;(Talk to Little One or the blubberbeast, optional)
:'''Weakened Blubberbeast:''' Aouhhh...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Arawr?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Awwrr...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Weakened Blubberbeast:''' Aouh?
:'''Weakened Blubberbeast:''' Aouh...
:'''Weakened Blubberbeast:''' Auh!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't understand their conversation at all, but it seems they've reached an understanding...?
:{{DIcon}} It's fine if you don't get it.
:{{DIcon}} As long as the emotion's there, that's all that matters.
:'''Paimon:''' Makes sense. Even though the Blubberbeast doesn't have much strength, it feels like they're really happy &mdash; and Paimon feels happy for 'em, too!

;(Interact with the cooking pot)
:'''Paimon:''' We said we were going to cook, but what exactly should we make?
;(If [[The Blubberbeast's Affection]] has not been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' Blubberbeasts live in the water, so it must eat fish, right? Let's do a fish dish, then.
;(If [[The Blubberbeast's Affection]] has been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... We used to feed fish to the Blubberbeast [[Berrypuffier|Berrypuff]], didn't we? In that case, a fish dish should do just fine!
:'''Paimon:''' If we want the Blubberbeast and {{Little One}} to eat well... Natlan's special [[Grilled Fish in Mint Sauce]] might be a pretty good choice.
:{{DIcon}} That's practically a specialty of mine.
:{{DIcon}} Can't say I've perfected it, but no problem.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, let's get started then. Paimon will give you some pointers while you're at it!

;(Step 1)
::{{DIcon}} Make deeper cuts.
:::'''Paimon:''' That's right! The deeper the cuts, the deeper the flavor seeps in!
::{{DIcon}} Make shallower cuts.
:::'''Paimon:''' Not bad. It should keep the flavor light while maintaining the original fishiness &mdash; which the Blubberbeast is sure to love.
;(Step 2)
::{{DIcon}} A little extra salt, a little extra happiness!
:::'''Paimon:''' Mmm, that sure tastes rich. {{Little One}} and the Blubberbeast are going to love it!
::{{DIcon}} The flavor's great as-is. No need for any salt.
:::'''Paimon:''' Yup. We've still got other seasonings, so we don't have to go so heavy on the salt.
;(Step 3)
::{{DIcon}} Mint sauce. The more, the merrier.
:::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that refreshing, cool taste is going to be awesome!
::{{DIcon}} Will an aquatic animal like the Blubberbeast be afraid of mint?
:::'''Paimon:''' That's not how that works. A Blubberbeast is going to find the surface dry and hot, so adding a little mint sauce ought to help it cool down, right?
;(Step 4)
::{{DIcon}} Chili peppers are indispensable.
:::'''Paimon:''' Just the right amount of spiciness &mdash; enough to whet the appetite!
::{{DIcon}} Animals from [[Fontaine]] might be allergic to spicy food...
:::'''Paimon:''' But it'd feel like something is missing if there's no chili at all, so why not add just a little?
;(Step 5)
::{{DIcon}} Flame-grilled over scorching heat &mdash; crispy on the outside, tender on the inside!
:::'''Paimon:''' Heehee, that sounds so delicious, Paimon's drooling already.
::{{DIcon}} Slow roasted &mdash; tender and juicy!
:::'''Paimon:''' Wow, amazing! {{Traveler}}'s secret art grilled fish... Maybe someday it'll become one of your specialties and you'll be able to cook it for our other friends!
:{{Black Screen|After a splendid culinary process, the special fish you grilled for {{Little One}} and the Blubberbeast is ready...}}
;(Obtain {{Item|Secret Art Grilled Fish in Mint Sauce}})

;(Give the food to Little One and the blubberbeast)
:'''Paimon:''' Here comes something yummy! Don't just play around &mdash; you have to replenish your energy, too.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Weakened Blubberbeast:''' A... Aooouhh!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, looks like they're having a great time. Will you choke if you eat upside down like that, though...?
:{{DIcon}} Stay safe. Don't be like that Blubberbeast.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, what's with that patronizing tone? Paimon's no Blubberbeast. She's not gonna be so silly as to eat like that.
:{{DIcon}} Try it yourself and you'll see.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Paimon's not gonna eat like that &mdash; she isn't a Blubberbeast anyway!
:{{Black Screen|The Blubberbeast seems to have recovered enough strength for it to flap over and tumble into the sea...}}
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Mmm... Aourgh!
:'''Now-Healthy Blubberbeast:''' Aohh! Woo... Arr!
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, it's gone...
:{{DIcon}} That's just how things are. I mean, it's not indigenous to Natlan.
:{{DIcon}} Best if it goes back where it belongs.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrooh...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't be sad, {{Little One}}. You had so much fun just now, and you're already friends!
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, Paimon's got a feeling that this isn't the last we've seen of that Blubberbeast!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
