{{Enemy Intro|plural=yes|name=The '''Coral Defenders''', also known as the '''Bathysmal Vishap Herd'''<ref>Adventurer Handbook: [[Adventurer Handbook|Bathysmal Vishap Herd]]</ref>,}} The herd consists of a particularly powerful [[Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap]] and [[Rimebiter Bathysmal Vishap]]. In order to challenge them, the player must have completed the {{Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}.

These Bathysmal Vishaps were specifically modified by the [[Vishap Research Lab]] to accept grafted fragments of [[Orobashi]]'s [[Bloodbranch Coral]] without adverse side effects, making them exceptionally large and powerful.<ref name="STDS">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref> This was a painstaking process, since beings of the [[Light Realm]] (such as Vishaps) naturally reject those of the [[Realm|Human Realm]] (which includes the Gods).<ref name="TBC4">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records}}</ref>

{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Bathysmal Vishap Herd

|name_1 = Cleansing Shower
|desc_1 = Forms an orb within their mouth and launches it at the player. On hit, the orb deals '''5% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} or {{Color|Electro DMG}} and drains 30 [[Energy]] from the active character. If the active character has less than 30 Energy, the rest of the drain is converted to [[HP Loss]].
* The HP Loss is calculated as:<br><math>\begin{align} \text{HP Loss} = {} & ( 17 \% \times \text{Character Max HP} + 600 ) \\
& \times ( 1 - \frac{\text{Remaining Energy}}{30} ) \end{align}</math>

|name_2 = Spike Field
|desc_2 = One of the vishaps plugs its tail into the ground, creating a large field, within which ice shards or Electro Energy frequently spike from the ground at random locations, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} or {{Color|Electro DMG}}. If a player is within the field, a spike will appear at the player's exact location every 2 seconds up to three times.
* If both vishaps are on the arena, only the Rimebiter Vishap can use the Spike Field attack. The Bolteater Vishap will not use this attack until the Rimebiter Vishap reaches critical health.

--><li>{{Color|Electro|Bolteater}}: Summons an orb in front of it that fires three bolts in a spread after a delay. The bolts then fire themselves towards the player's position, each dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.</li><!--
--></ul><!--
-->Repeated DMG instances dealt by these attacks will have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_5 = Critical Assist
|desc_5 = After '''Double Beams''', the vishap at critical health jumps into nearby water and swims around the arena, and periodically launches waves of 3 projectiles that home towards the player, each dealing '''30% ATK'''as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} or {{Color|Electro DMG}} on hit. Repeated DMG instances will have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]].

===Combo===
{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Bathysmal Vishap Herd

|name_1 = Rapid Fire
|desc_1 = The vishaps connect their tails and fire a barrage of alternating {{Cryo}} and {{Electro}} shards at the player, each dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} or {{Color|Electro DMG}}. Repeated DMG instances will have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_2 = Double Beams
|desc_2 = Once one of the vishaps reaches critical health, both vishaps join their tails at the center of the arena, forms a circular field below them that randomly and rapidly deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DoT}} and {{Color|Electro DoT}} simultaneously, and each fires a laser beam from its mouth, raking across the arena, randomly and rapidly dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} or {{Color|Electro DMG}} to players caught in the beam and destroying all walls in the process. Repeated DMG instances will have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]].

===Rimebiter-Exclusive===
{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Bathysmal Vishap Herd

|name_1 = Slash Combo
|desc_1 = If the player is within melee range, the Rimebiter Vishap performs 2 horizontal slashes followed by a downward smash, dealing '''30% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''80% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Physical DMG}} with each hit.
}}

===Bolteater-Exclusive===
{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Bathysmal Vishap Herd

|name_1 = Assist
|desc_1 = If a wall is intact, the Bolteater Vishap climbs up a wall and repeatedly launches '''Cleansing Shower''' orbs at the player. Orbs launched this way have the same Energy or HP draining effects, although with a minor homing property and a slower travel speed.
* Destroying the wall will cause the vishap to fall, temporarily incapacitating it.
|file_1_2 = Bathysmal Vishap Herd Assist Incapacitated
|caption_1_2 = Incapacitated
}}

===Spiral Abyss/Imaginarium Theater===
In the [[Spiral Abyss]] and [[Imaginarium Theater]], the Coral Defenders lose the '''Assist''' and '''Critical Assist''' attacks, but gain the following ability:
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = [[Paired Opponents|Revival]]
|desc_1 = A visible link connects the two Vishaps. If one Vishap's HP reaches '''1.2%''' and the other Vishap is not defeated within the next 10 seconds, the defeated Vishap will be revived with '''50%/40%/30%/20%''' of its Max HP if revived '''1/2/3/4+''' time(s).
|file_1 = Bathysmal Vishap Herd Soul Link
}}

==Strategy==
* Dodging the '''Cleansing Shower''' orbs or having characters with high [[Energy/Energy Recharge|Energy Recharge]] is beneficial for this fight as having low Energy can prove to be fatal if the player cannot dodge their Cleansing Shower attacks.
* The pillars that the Bolteater Vishap jumps onto are [[Geo Construct]]s and can be easily destroyed using [[Blunt Attack]]s. Alternatively, try to stay far away from the Bolteater Vishap, as the orbs are harder to dodge while up close.

==Trivia==
* Despite being a herd which would consist of numerous members, this challenge only consists of two boss enemies.
** This also makes it the first normal boss challenge that doesn't consist of a single, unique enemy. Others include the [[Icewind Suite]] and [[Dual Maguu Kenki]].
* The Coral Defenders were the first Normal Boss with their own battle music, [[No Turning Back]], a remix of [[Beats of Water Drops]].
* The Coral Defenders are the only Normal Boss that lacks an archive entry. Rather, the [[Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap]] and [[Rimebiter Bathysmal Vishap]] have their own archive entries.
* If the Coral Defenders are killed with one of them in a Critical Assist state, the vishap in that state will simply disappear with no death animation played.
* The walls in the boss fight used for skills such as Assist are considered {{color|Geo Constructs}}.
