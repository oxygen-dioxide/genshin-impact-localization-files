'''Thunder Sakura''' are large tree-trunks infused with {{Electro}}. There are five of them across [[Kannazuka]]. When the player gets close to one, they will target the player with deadly [[lightning]] bolts, dealing {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. During the [[World Quest]] ''[[Sakura Arborism]]'', the player is tasked with healing the trees in [[Kannazuka]]. After a tree is healed, it will be inert and no longer attack the player with lightning.

There are also five Thunder Sakura roots located throughout [[Narukami Island]], which the Traveler purifies during the [[World Quest]] series ''[[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]]''.

==Overview==
The Thunder Sakura are believed to symbolize the [[Electro Archon]]'s eternal watch over Inazuma and purify evil by absorbing filth from the land. The Thunder Sakura are side branches of the [[Sacred Sakura]], so the filth accumulated in a Thunder Sakura will spread up the roots and to the central roots of the Sacred Sakura beneath [[Mt. Yougou]]. If too much filth accumulates, the roots will begin to corrode and form tumors, thus it is necessary to routinely perform a [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual#Lore|Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] to purify the filth from the roots.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sacrificial Offering}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|Sacred Sakura Cleansing Summary}}</ref>

The Thunder Sakura are either guarding or suppressing something located under the trees, which is why the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Faction)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] grew concerned over their condition and [[Miyuki]] was dispatched to investigate.<ref name="Sakura Arborism">{{Ref/Quest|Sakura Arborism}}</ref><ref group="Note">In ''Sakura Arborism'', Miyuki remarks that the Thunder Sakura "serve to suppress the one who lies beneath." The equivalent Chinese line says {{lang|mini=1|zh=毕竟树下还镇守着那位大人的…|zh_tl=After all, these trees are still guarding what lies beneath, that Great One's...,}} where {{lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|大人||Noun 2}}|zh_rm=dàrén}} is a respectful term of address for someone of high rank and {{lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|的||Definition 2}}|zh_rm=de}} indicates that whatever Miyuki left unsaid somehow relates back to this person. The phrase translated as "to suppress" is {{lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|鎮守|镇守|Chinese}}|zh_tl=to guard}}, which is translated as "guard" or "defender" in other parts of the game; "suppress" and "seal" are typically used to translate the words {{lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|壓制|压制|Chinese}}|zh_tl=to repress}} or {{lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|鎮壓|镇压|Chinese}}|zh_tl=to suppress}}. However, there is too little information to determine whether the English interpretation is necessarily incorrect, as Miyuki's line was left unfinished.</ref>

| quote = The five Thunder Sakura trees are not difficult to find. You just have to follow the western shoreline from the northernmost point of the [[Kujou Encampment]] islet to northernmost point of [[Tatarasuna]] &mdash; you'll encounter three of them that way. As for the other two, one is on the mountain northwest of Tatarasuna, the other is on another mountain to the southwest.
