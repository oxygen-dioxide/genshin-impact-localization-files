==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Eunomia:''' Everything must have proper standards. I must admit that I prefer such work.
:{{DIcon}} You "prefer"?
::'''Eunomia:''' That's right. I'm comparing this to my previous work in external publicity relations, by the way.
::'''Eunomia:''' I'll never be able to understand how some of my old colleagues thought. It's almost as if they had a waterfall in their heads that could wash all their reason away.
::'''Eunomia:''' "We should construct a bust of the [[Neuvillette|Chief Justice]] at the entrance to the [[Palais Mermonia]]!"
::'''Eunomia:''' &mdash;They'd say, as if we didn't have enough people coming in from outside.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about measurement standards... 
::'''Eunomia:''' Well, that's the focus of my work.
::'''Eunomia:''' As you know, people who live in different regions have different habits when taking measurements.
::'''Eunomia:''' The people in the eastern part of the city say that a length of rope is a quarter-meter long, and people in the west will ask "and how much is that, exactly?"
::'''Eunomia:''' My job is to match these things that don't fit together and come up with a common name for them, for example, "Mermonia Meters," or something of the order.
::'''Eunomia:''' That was just an example, by the way. Please don't take it too seriously.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Eunomia:''' See you.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
*In Greek mythology, {{w|Eunomia}} was a minor goddess of law and legislation.
*The dialogue about measurement standards is a reference to the {{w|International System of Units}}, which aims to standardize units worldwide.
