Under most circumstances, this animal is peaceful and will not attack other creatures without good reason.<br>Upon entering The Realm Within, the Brown Deer's distinctive antlers, resembling tree branches, became an ideal perch for various birds. In this peaceful setting, the competition among Brown Deer shifted from the splendor of their antlers to the number of birds that perched upon them, for in the tranquil Realm Within, popularity equates to strength...
