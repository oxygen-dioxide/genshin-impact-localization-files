==Trivia==
* Though ''Genshin Impact'' releases artwork for a number of real holidays around the world, the developers have chosen to develop in-game events that correspond to [[Teyvat]]'s culture instead, such as [[Liyue]]'s [[Lantern Rite Festival]] and [[Mondstadt]]'s [[Windblume Festival]].<ref>Weibo: [https://weibo.com/6593199887/Jn6W7k7fZ {{zh|【关于节日活动相关问题说明】}}]</ref>
** Even though in-game events do not explicitly name real world holidays, every occurrence of the Lantern Rite Festival has corresponded with {{w|Chinese New Year}}.
