'''Lumencages''' (''unofficial name'') are objects found in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. While active, the player can attack a Lumencage to fire luminous projectiles, which will explode on hit and destroy the Lumencage's associated targets as well as [[Oozing Concretions]]. The firing direction depends on the direction from which they took a hit. Destroying all associated targets will reveal a chest or progress a quest objective.

==Notes==
* The luminous projectile can be fired once every '''0.2''' seconds.
