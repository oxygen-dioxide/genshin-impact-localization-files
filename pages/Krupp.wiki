'''Krupp''' was a menial who worked for the [[Fatui]] as one of [[Il Dottore]]'s adjutants. He was a character original to the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Story==
===Manga===
Krupp first appears in the [[Haeresys]], a Fatui underground arena where captured test subjects are used to fight an unknown creature. Displeased by his menial, Dottore calls Krupp's work "pathetic as usual" before threatening to make him into a test subject as well.

Desperate to avoid this fate, Krupp tells Dottore that they have received an invitation to Mondstadt's [[Ludi Harpastum]] festival and suggests that they can recruit more test subjects from Mondstadt. Confidently claiming he will get decent results to please his master, the two go to [[Dawn Winery]], where [[Diluc]] is holding a party. Inside Dawn Winery, Dottore orders Diluc to bring the Seneschal [[Seamus Pegg]] to him, but Diluc expresses unfamiliarity with Dottore. Krupp "humbly" introduces Dottore as his master, telling Diluc about his status as one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] and the champion who defeated [[Ursa the Drake]]. Diluc agrees to let them meet in his manor, but only on the condition that he is allowed to sit in with them; Krupp accepts.

In the manor's meeting chambers, Krupp attempts to convince [[Kaeya]] and Seamus Pegg to allow the Fatui to recruit from Mondstadt's populace, saying that every city on the continent has agreed to seek protection from the Fatui and that Mondstadt's youths can become heroes in the Fatui's ranks. However, Kaeya is aware of their intentions and calls out their plan as a "blood tax" paid with the lives of Mondstadt's children. Krupp retorts that he would never call it that. Seamus tries to delay their response until the [[Varka|Grand Master]] is made aware of the situation, but Krupp demands an immediate answer; Diluc ends the negotiations there and Krupp and Dottore exit the chambers.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|1}}</ref>

In the Winery's manor, Dottore expresses his anger towards Krupp for wasting his time in the meeting chamber, telling Krupp to find a solution after the Knights of Favonius refused their treaty. After Dottore leaves, Krupp briefly ponders stealing a glass of wine before he is interrupted by Kaeya's friendly greeting. Kaeya claims that the Seneschal is considering the Fatui's offer and suggests that he might be more convinced if the deal is made more favorable for Mondstadt.

Krupp is next seen descending into the winery cellar, planning to steal the wine barrels with his guards' help. However, he is ambushed by the "Darknight Hero" (Diluc's secret identity) and realizes it was a trap. Krupp calls his guards and attempts to flee, but Diluc quickly dispatches the guards and captures Krupp using chains conjured by his [[Delusion]]. Diluc interrogates him about the missing children from Mondstadt experimented on by the Fatui, and Krupp quickly turns on his master. However, before Krupp can provide any further information about Dottore's plans, Dottore appears and kills Krupp for his ineptitude and breach of confidential information. He walks away, leaving Diluc with Krupp's corpse in the cellar.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|1|2}}</ref>

Later, Dottore transforms Krupp's corpse into an [[Automatons|Automaton]]-like monster, and is seen praising it for its combat prowess amidst a field of dead [[hilichurls]]. He leaves the monster to run amok in the wilderness.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|4}}</ref> Later, [[Amber]] is attacked by the Krupp-automaton after attempting to retrieve a discarded Fatui device from a hilichurl camp, and [[Jean]] arrives in time to back her up.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|5|2}}</ref> Jean defeats the Krupp-automaton once, but it restores itself and chases Amber in pursuit of the device.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|6}}</ref> In the end, Amber and Jean manage to destroy it by baiting it towards the hilichurl camp's explosive barrels and then setting them off.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|6|2}}</ref>
