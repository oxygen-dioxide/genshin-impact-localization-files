The '''Seven Mountain Treatises''' is a document first mentioned by [[Baizhu]] in ''[[A Teapot to Call Home: Part I]]''. Based on current descriptions and references to it, it appears to be some sort of natural history document.

==Contents==
The Sixth Commentary of the Seven Mountain Treatises mentions [[Smaragdus Jadeite]]. It states that this substance springs forth from Stonemarrow within the mountains, and will bring disaster to any mere mortals who touch it. Sustained contact with Smaragdus Jadeite by someone without a [[Vision]] over a prolonged period will, in less serious cases, cause a mild malady, while in serious cases, the patient may suffer a dramatic change of personality and fall seriously ill.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part I}}</ref>

The Seven Mountain Treatises also records that [[Tianqiu Valley]] was once home to a mysterious kind of stone that would absorb the rosy hue of sunset after basking in it evening after evening over a long period, which became known as "[[Sunset Stone]]." However, the claim has never been proven. Today, this term is used generally to refer to all manner of brown-colored stones.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Sunset Stone}}</ref>

It also records that the whiter the sand nearby a [[Whitesand Coconut Tree]], the better the quality of the coconuts that grow on the tree. For this reason, "Whitesand" is a term for coconut trees of the highest grade.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Whitesand Coconut Tree}}</ref>
