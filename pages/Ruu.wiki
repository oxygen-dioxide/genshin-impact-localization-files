'''Ruu''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Through the Mists}}.

==Profile==
Ruu was the child of the last priest, [[Mata]], of [[Tsurumi Island]], and from a young age, he studied [[Ishine Script]] under Mata's guidance. Ruu enjoyed spending time with the other villagers. He was also fond of singing, although he was somewhat embarrassed about it and often went off into the fog to sing alone. His singing captivated the local deity, the [[Thunderbird]], who originally paid no mind to the island's people. However, Ruu was not intimidated by the guardian, and they talked briefly, with Ruu giving her the name "[[Kapatcir|Kanna Kapatcir]]." They promised to meet each other again in the future.

However, the situation on Tsurumi Island had gotten worse, and some of Ruu's friends began leaving the island into the "Sea of Darkness." Hoping to bring them back, Ruu offered himself as a sacrifice to please Kapatcir. Mata also believed that Ruu was favored by Thunderbird and planned to sacrifice him to please their deity. In the final ceremony, Ruu was chosen as a living sacrifice<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Omen of Thunderstorm|note=Chinese version|quote={{Zh|用以将活祭的鲜血献给雷之魔鸟。|tl=Used to offer the blood of the living sacrifice to the Thunderbird.}}}}</ref> and died at the [[Moshiri Ceremonial Site]]. Later, when Kapatcir returned to check on Ruu, she found his blood in a [[Omen of Thunderstorm|golden goblet]] on a sacrificial altar in [[Mt. Kanna]]. Kapatcir was enraged, seeing his sacrifice as the murder of an innocent and the breaking of his promise to sing to her again. She destroyed the entire village, killing everyone, and cursed the island to relive its destruction over and over again for eternity.

Ruu was unaffected by the curse that affected the other villagers, as he could see and hear everything around him. Ruu initially went along with the events, but time was reset after the thunder struck. He had tried to leave the island but was unable to. Likewise, he had also noticed the presence of [[hilichurls]] and [[rifthounds]], both of whom were not present on the island in his time. In the thousands of years, Ruu found that no one else could see or talk to him. He continued to try to complete the ceremony and "died" countless times as a result, but never succeeded.

The mysteries of Tsurumi Island caught the attention of both the [[Bantan Sango Detective Agency]] and [[Adventurers' Guild]], with [[Sumida]] commissioning them to obtain a [[Maushiro]] from the island. Ruu met with [[Ryuuji]] and [[Roald]] but worried for their safety when they left the island and didn't return. Sumida eventually commissioned the [[Traveler]] to obtain one on her behalf, and they met Ruu. Ruu was surprised to see new people and explained the island's properties to them and to help set up the ceremony, which they did. When the Traveler obtained the Maushiro and left, Ruu wondered where they had gone.

The Traveler and [[Paimon]] eventually returned as the Maushiro they had acquired was not a genuine one, but an illusion from the time loop that eventually disappeared. Ruu was relieved to see them again as he thought they had died in the "Sea of Darkness." He helped them find a real Maushiro before leaving.

Still intrigued by the mysteries surrounding the island, the Traveler spoke with [[Kama]] and learned of the truth of the ordeal. The Traveler returned to the island and destroyed the Thunderbird perches to stop the ceremony, which caused fierce storms to strike the island. When they returned to check on Ruu, he was upset by their actions, as he explained that he felt something had gone wrong during the ceremony and he had sought outside aid. He left crying, feeling betrayed by the Traveler.

The Traveler eventually returned with Kama to restore Tsurumi Island before another time loop would take place. Ruu was surprised to see the Traveler and Paimon again before noticing Kama. He was informed that Kama's ancestor had lived a long and happy life, with his only regret not coming back for Ruu. He was also surprised to learn that Kapatcir was upset with the ceremony and cursed the land due to the sacrifice and would only lift the curse if she heard his song once more. However, as Kapatcir was killed by the Shogun later (albeit revived as the [[Thunder Manifestation]]), the Traveler and Paimon bluffed that she had moved to [[Seirai Island]]. Ruu was initially unable to leave the island. However, by using a leftover [[Peculiar Pinion|feather]] that contained her power, they were able to bring him to Seirai Island, where he sang for her.

Returning to Tsurumi Island, the land was cleansed of the "curse," as Kapatcir's grief had vanished. Ruu expressed gratitude to the Traveler and apologized for his error. He was enthusiastic about the outside world and looked forward to exploring it in the future. He decides, however, to stay on the island for the time being to rest.

===Appearance===
Ruu shares a similar appearance to [[Chouji]], although he wears blue clothes and has blue and white leg wraps.

==Trivia==
* The [[Thundering Fury]] set of artifacts' lore details the downfall of Tsurumi and the sacrifice of Ruu. Most notably, the "Omen of Thunderstorm" goblet is said to have held Ruu's blood after his sacrifice to the Thunderbird.
* Ruu once referred to Mata as "Dad" instead of "Grandpa Mata," although he quickly corrected himself. 
** One possible explanation for this is that Ruu was born into a family of priests, and was required to use honorifics or titles that reflect the seniority or clan status of the person being addressed when speaking to Mata in public.
* Ruu is mentioned in the {{Quest|For the Children of the Past}} if {{Quest|Through the Mists}} was completed beforehand.
