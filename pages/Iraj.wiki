:'''Iraj:''' Great, everything is fine just as usual, nothing suspicious.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Iraj:''' Hello, do you need any help?
::'''Iraj:''' Hmm... You look strong and energetic. I don't think you do.
::'''Iraj:''' Then enjoy the rainforest! The way of life in the forest may be quite primitive, but you won't find any place that is cleaner and more comfortable than here.
::'''Iraj:''' I often volunteer to change shifts with my colleagues, just to wander the forest a little longer.
::'''Iraj:''' ...Oh, of course I'll still carry out my duty seriously if something really does happen.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Iraj:''' See you, enjoy the fresh air!
