==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Leong:''' Hello there. I'm sorry, but [[Yip Tak|Boss Yip]] isn't in, so you'll have to wait if you're here to buy some tea.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Leong:''' Just call me Leong! I'm the assistant here, and I usually do things like preparing tea and doing accounts...
::'''Leong:''' Oh, and you can let me know if you want to place an order. I promise to keep those fine teas for you! Haha!
::{{DIcon}} About tea...
::'''Leong:''' You've come to the right person! The boss's wife and I share the same hometown, and we came here, one after the other, many years ago. I've had all sorts of fine teas!
::'''Leong:''' Qiaoying Village's Sunglo Tea has a fresh and clean aroma, and Single-Origin Yauwan Tea is refreshing with a sweet aftertaste. Both of them are exquisite and fine! You can't go wrong with either!
::'''Leong:''' However... If you're looking to buy someone a gift, you should notify Boss Yip in advance.
::{{DIcon}} Why?
::'''Leong:''' The tea leaves in our village are picked and sold collectively, and the profits are distributed later on, per our contracts.
::'''Leong:''' All the bosses have signed an agreement with the village. Right now? The best part of the best batch of tea should have been sold out a long time ago.
::'''Leong:''' The ordinary tea farmers are only left with some surplus for private consumption now. That stuff's not bad, but I wouldn't call it fit for a gift.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Leong:''' All right! Come again!
