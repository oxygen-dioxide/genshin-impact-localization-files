;(Approach the plinth)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Here you go. What lies before you is a mock-up of the course that will be used for the upcoming tournament.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean... this entire thing!?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If it's for the [[Pilgrimage]], it's gotta be grand.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That's right. I've designed this one to make use of the Stadium's maximum capacity, and I've given thought to every space, every placement, and every dimension.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' See this kindling?
:;(The camera pans to a fiery orange ball with wings)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Contestants will have to chase it throughout the competition, encountering all kinds of terrain, and they'll prove themselves by using their abilities to overcome anything and everything that stands in their way. That's the focus of this course.
:{{DIcon}} Ooh, so that's the kind of competition this is.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yep, this round counts as a knockout round. There'll be other events as well, and the eight contestants with the highest total scores will move onto the final individual battles.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you're keeping those?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yeah, everyone loves a good duel. It really gets the adrenaline pumping, and allows people to go all-out with their skills.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A warrior should always feel fortunate to meet their match on the battlefield, even if it only happens once in their life... No one can resist such a good fight.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the most Natlan thing Paimon's ever heard! This tournament, too. It's just so... you.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oh? Why do you say that?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, the competition's all about chasing the kindling, and you're all chasing something, too, right?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Ooh, that's a good metaphor. That'll come in handy when I'm explaining my ideation process later...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, I'm glad you found this helpful.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' The benefits of having Paimon and {{Traveler}} as friends and teachers, hehe!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Alright, well... Judging by your faces, well... You look like you're raring to go, Mavuika, so why don't you try it first?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No problem. I'll go get ready.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Mavuika looks so excited! She must really be looking forward to this!
:{{DIcon}} She might be a little too excited about the competition...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you... think that she seems a little bit different? After the war and all?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like, y'know, maybe in her sense of playfulness? She seems less serious than before. More willing to just loosen up and have fun.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 09.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Nope, you're not hallucinating. I agree!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you heard too? So Paimon's right, right?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 10.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yeah! The side of her that she hid during the war has now come out. Makes sense, though &mdash; everyone wants to unwind a bit after accomplishing an important goal.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 11.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' She's earned it.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, so that's why you called us over? It's all a part of your grand plan, huh...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 12.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Not exactly. I did expect Mavuika to take this one, though, so I also planned some other events for you.
:{{DIcon}} You're so considerate, Coach!
:{{DIcon}} People like you are awesome!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 13.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hah, spare the flattery. It'll be awkward if you end up complaining that you're tired later.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, Coach, what about Paimon? Does she not even get to be a substitute?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 14.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Erm...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 15.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Ahem. You have not yet met the basic criteria to even begin training. Practice a few more years and come back, then we'll see.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, c'mooon!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'm ready!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 16.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Alright!
;(A [[#Tutorial|Tutorial]] appears)

;(If the player leaves the area or fails the challenge)
;(Talk to Iansan)<!-- New quest step: "Return to the starting point and talk to Iansan" -->
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 22.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Huh? Did you go the wrong way?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 23.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' No worries, we can just start over again. Let me know when you're ready.

;(While completing the challenge)
<!-- Approach the solid phlogiston platforms -->
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 17.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Wow! Contestant Mavuika is wasting no time at the starting line. She's sprinting ahead at breathtaking speed!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Live commentary, huh? Very nice.
<!-- Approach the solid phlogiston spikes -->
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 19.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You doing alright? If you need a timeout, just let me know.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's a piece of cake.
<!-- Approach the Secret Source Automaton -->
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Did you hear that?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh! Enemies incoming. Be careful!
<!-- When the Automaton reaches 1/3 HP -->
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 20.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Seems like we've disturbed some kinda device that's lain dormant for years... Sorry, this part is completely unexpected.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 21.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Still, shouldn't pose a problem for you.
<!-- Board the spiritway -->
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've got to say, this is pretty interesting.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 iansan 18.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hmm. If it's "interesting" to you, does that mean it might be "impossible" for others...?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, you said you wanted to challenge people, so let them rise to the challenge!

;(After completing the challenge)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Course complete!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good job, contestant! Here, have some water!
:{{DIcon}} Now that was exciting!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You're too kind. Thank you, my dear audience, and thank you, Coach!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Well, what do you think? First things first, let me just say that the enemies at the end were definitely not part of the plan... the device... never did anything before...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe it can't detect anyone under a certain height...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' ...In which case, you would've been fine, too.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Good point.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's a solid course, but there are a number of small problems.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' For example, take the chase at the start. I feel like it's too short to separate the best from the rest. Why don't you find a few more people to test it out and adjust the distance based on their feedback?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, you're really thorough! And yeah, getting multiple opinions is a great idea!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Also, about the vertical section. It's only so-so, and contestants might get dizzy from the sudden change of direction, which might cause some of them to fall if they get motion sickness.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Also...
<!-- Camera zooms out, they keep talking inaudibly, then camera zooms back in -->
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Got it all down.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Couldn't have spotted any of these issues without actually running the course... Thanks for your help, Mavuika. I'll keep making improvements based on these suggestions.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That reminds me of something I was talking to {{Traveler}} about, actually &mdash; I've also got a ball launcher here. Want to give it a try?
;(The group walks towards the Stadium's main arena)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A ball launcher?
:{{DIcon}} Is this one of the "other events" that you mentioned?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yup! Ball sports are also a proud, ancient tradition here in Natlan. I've decided to use one for an event.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's been a long time since I last saw gear like this. This game can be played by two, three, or four people, and it's a fun one.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Want to give it a try, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I'm game.
::{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 08a 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Great. I'll be your opponent, then.
:{{DIcon}} Happy to play with you.
::{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 08b 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thank you for agreeing to be my opponent.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' In that case, get into position, you two, and I'll start the clock. Whoever has the higher score when the clock runs out wins.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 09.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' If you're ready... Begin!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, {{Traveler}}! You can beat her!

;(Talk to Mavuika before starting the challenge, optional)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 mavuika 08b 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thank you for agreeing to be my opponent.

;(Start the challenge)
:;(A [[#Tutorial|Tutorial]] appears)

;(During the game)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 2 iansan 10.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Ooh! Great shot!

;(After completing the game)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was a thrilling game! Paimon was on the edge of her seat...
;(If you don't miss any ball)
::{{DIcon}} I managed to force the great Pyro Archon to a draw!
::{{A|vo mwklq002 3 mavuika 01b 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Indeed you did. I've noticed that you're very good at games. And now that I've found such a great opponent, we've got to have a rematch sometime.
;(If you miss any ball)
::{{DIcon}} As expected, you're a pro, Mavuika... I concede.
::{{A|vo mwklq002 3 mavuika 01a 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You played well. We can play a few more rounds when we have the time.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That should also be enough data and feedback on my end for now. Thanks for all the help, everyone.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No, we should be thanking you. Both the mock course and the ball launcher were fantastic. I didn't know you were so good at making things like this.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Ah, you flatter me. It wasn't all my own handiwork &mdash; I contracted out a part of the work you gave me to [[Xilonen]].
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' She was a little reluctant, but once I mentioned that you were the one who had asked me to find some helpers, she volunteered to help.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Looks like I also have you to thank for her negative views about me... How much would you say you contributed? Thirty percent?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Absolutely not, I'd say ten at most. Please do not blame your problems on me.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Your attendance was a pleasant surprise, {{Traveler}}, Paimon. I didn't think you'd have time to try the ball launcher out for at least a few more days... Thanks for coming.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, you know what they say, embrace the unexpected!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for having us, Iansan.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Well, I'm just glad that you had fun. In that case, let's call this a day.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Y'know, we should probably call it a day."</ref>
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I need to get going now, those improvements won't make themselves, so see you later!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bye! See you soon!
:{{DIcon}} Bye, Coach!
;(Iansan starts to walk away)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' See you soon, Coach!
;(Iansan startles, waving her hands in embarrassment)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Whew, it's not every day that I get to call Iansan that... Did you see the look on her face? She almost jumped out of her own skin, ahaha!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You kinda enjoy messing with people, don't you...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Really? I never noticed.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Anyway, we've been out and about so long... You must be hungry. Come on, let's go get some grub. My treat.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wha&mdash;? Okay, Paimon takes it all back! You're the best person ever!

;(Approach the marked location at [["Scions of the Canopy"]])
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hey there, [[Hinchei|Boss]], I'm here with some guests. I'll have the usual.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 resterauntboss 01.ogg}} '''Hinchei:''' Ah, [[Pyro Archon]]! Welcome, welcome. It's been a while. Glad to see you with our new heroes, too.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Boss, this is {{Traveler}}, and this is Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Nice to meet you.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi there!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 resterauntboss 02.ogg}} '''Hinchei:''' Hehe, greetings to you both as well. You'll have the same as before, then?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We worked out today, so yeah, that would be great.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Erm, so, what is "the usual"?
:{{DIcon}} We can just have some snacks. Paimon already eats too much as it is...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, come on, {{Traveler}}! You've never been stingy even we were low on Mora, so why are you're going after Paimon's food now that someone's treating us?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 resterauntboss 03.ogg}} '''Hinchei:''' Hahaha, you two are a riot. I get where {{Traveler}}'s coming from, though. You're too cute not to tease, Miss Paimon.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If someone's down in the dumps, your banter can cheer them right up. That's not just from me, by the way. I've heard it from plenty of other people.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ehh? F&mdash;For real? So, were you teasing Paimon on purpose, {{Traveler}}...?
:{{DIcon}} Of course. You can eat as much as you want.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 resterauntboss 04.ogg}} '''Hinchei:''' Just leave it to us! Please wait a moment &mdash; your food will be out shortly.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Alright &mdash; eat your fill, Paimon, but just remember the tournament is in three days. So try and make sure your food coma is finished by then.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What, what? Food coma? ...Hmph, dunno what you're talking about. Paimon will be there on time, don't you worry.
:{{DIcon}} Seems like you've also grown fond of teasing Paimon, Mavuika.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, don't worry. In the event that you do oversleep a bit, I have my ways of waking you up...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? You do? Uh...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Speaking of your "ways," Mavuika, you still haven't told us about how you plan to find [[Xbalanque]]!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh, that? It's actually quite simple.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Xbalanque is a native of Natlan. The records speak of him as a wise, brave, and upright man, and refer to him as "The First Sun."
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' People like that tend to be like me, passionate about competition. The more they disdain dishonest ways of winning, the more they'll celebrate a fair victory.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You could call that a trait shared by all the heroes of Natlan. They are full of energy and passion, and despise victories born of deceit. Conversely, they're constantly drawn to things that are full of hope and excitement.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean... Xbalanque might want to take part in this upcoming Pilgrimage?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's not a matter of "might." He will.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's precisely because such an important figure will be participating that we must prepare the best tournament possible.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Checking in on the various tribes was also to ensure that we'll be prepared to give him a warm welcome.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So... all we need to do is to look for him in the Stadium on that day. As the first Pyro Archon, he should have no problem running away with the whole competition.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, isn't it a bit unfair for the Pyro Archon themselves to participate in such a tournament? After all, everyone else is just an ordinary human...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' When Xbalanque ascended to archonhood, he did so as a human. I see no problem in allowing him to participate in this event as a "human" from ancient times.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're working on an autobiography!?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No, I was joking. Even Xbalanque didn't write one, so why would I? Still, if on the off-chance I ever did write one, you two'd definitely be in it.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then... can Paimon have a super long title?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Sure, as long as you want.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So many dishes, and such huge portions, too! Paimon spies mountains of meat as well... Wowee!!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hmm? You know this is just a normal breakfast, right?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, what!?
:{{DIcon}} Wait, what!?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 resterauntboss 05.ogg}} '''Hinchei:''' Our Archon's always had a healthy appetite. Hehe, please enjoy the food while it's still hot. Food never tastes as good once it gets cold.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that okay? Ehehe, actually, since it's so beautiful around here, we were planning to stay in the area for a few more days anyway, see the sights and all that!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Of course you can. I'll go arrange some accommodations for you, then.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why are you looking at Paimon like that? There's always room for dessert!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeoplea 01.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Man:''' Lord Xbalanque is coming back, huh? Well, I didn't see that coming... Wait, what's that look on your face? Don't tell me you don't even know who Xbalanque is?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeopleb 01.ogg}} '''Woman in Deep Thought:''' What kind of idiot do you take me for!? I was just thinking about it!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeopleb 02.ogg}} '''Woman in Deep Thought:''' I mean, we just managed to defeat the [[Abyss]] for good, and fulfill the wish of all citizens of Natlan, past and present... So why is he coming back now, of all times?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeoplea 02.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Man:''' Yeah, if he's here to help, the war's already over. And if he isn't...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeoplea 03.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Man:''' ...Uh, I just had a terrifying thought. What if he's actually some kind of villain who's come to steal our victory? Isn't that how the novels usually go?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeopleb 03.ogg}} '''Woman in Deep Thought:''' What? No! Don't be ridiculous! Novels are just fiction! Don't you slander our great hero. You're talking about Lord Xbalanque here, the one everyone calls The First Sun!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeopleb 04.ogg}} '''Woman in Deep Thought:''' Also, even if what you said were true, I don't think our Archon would lose! We all saw that one punch of hers. The power in it was like... Hah!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeoplea 04.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Man:''' Yeah, I agree, but I'll bet Lord Xbalanque's no slouch, either! Say, if they fought, who do you think would win?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeopleb 05.ogg}} '''Woman in Deep Thought:''' ...Argh... Well, you've got me there.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeopleb 06.ogg}} '''Woman in Deep Thought:''' Well, as someone living in this age, I've got to vote for our Archon, right? Live in the now, seize the day, and all that.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeoplea 05.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Man:''' Man, now that you mention it, a fight between those two is bound to be a terrific one... What I wouldn't give to watch!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 tribepeopleb 07.ogg}} '''Woman in Deep Thought:''' Alright, enough of that nonsense. It's already super late. If we keep hyping ourselves up, neither of us are gonna get any sleep tonight!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The way they're talking about the archons duelling each other almost makes it sound like a beetle battle...
:{{DIcon}} Way more exciting than a beetle battle, that's for sure.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! They really do love their contests of strength here in Natlan...

:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Will the legendary Xbalanque really participate? If he wins the whole thing, will Mavuika preside over the victory ceremony, too? The more I think about it, the more interesting it gets...)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 4 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew! Alright. Paimon's done eating. Let's head back and get some sleep!

:{{DIcon}} I'll hang on to you, Paimon, don't worry!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon doesn't count as a passenger, so we're not overloaded!

:{{A|vo mwklq002 7 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' No, as the designer of the course, that's out of the question.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 7 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I'm here to cheer everyone on and monitor the pre-event warm-up. Contestants must limber up properly if they don't want to get injured.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's fair. Can we ask you something, then? You know about Lord Xbalanque's resurrection, right? Have you seen anyone with that kind of aura over here?

:{{A|vo mwklq002 7 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I've kept an eye out, but haven't noticed anything unusual. At least, I haven't seen any contestant whose strength or skill is clearly a cut above the rest.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 7 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You're welcome... Wait, one moment!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 7 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You warm up as well. You'll be running alongside them in the Stadium, so you've got to go in prepared.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 7 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Stretch! Lower! Again! Good!

:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still, Paimon didn't think you'd be taking part, Citlali. Given who you are, are you sure it isn't against the rules?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Though not a violation per se, what it will be is an unpleasant surprise for the youngsters.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Normally, I stay out of this kind of event &mdash; don't want to put too much pressure on everyone else. But we're celebrating the end of the war here, so I'll give the occasion the respect it deserves.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what was that "Hmm... Hah!" thing all about? Some kinda strange ritual?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Of course not. I was using my power to search for Lord Xbalanque.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' To be more precise, I was trying to look for him in the world of souls. After all, I also have no idea what he might look like...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But why? He is the first Pyro Archon, after all, isn't it a given that he'll be revived with an unimaginably large amount of power?<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "...Still, nothing so far. *sigh* But... why?

:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we don't have any leads yet... We'll check for leads somewhere else. Good luck, Granny, and take care!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 9 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Be on your way, now. Oh, and take care of yourselves, too. Granny Itztli will display her dashing self on the competition grounds soon enough.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 8 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I locked him in a chest. I'm going to win the tournament solely on my own merit, so he's not needed during the competition.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha! Hmm, on a different note, have you heard anything about Lord Xbalanque?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 8 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I've looked all over, but haven't seen anyone that struck me as being on his level.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, you're reliable as always, Kinich! We should go check with the others now, so we'll see you later. Good luck, and make sure you don't get injured!

:{{A|vo mwklq002 10 kachina 07.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' A powerful figure like him is sure to attract attention wherever he goes. Like [[Mualani]] and Kinich &mdash; only even more so.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 10 kachina 08.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I haven't seen anyone like that, though... So he probably hasn't passed this way.

:{{A|vo mwklq002 11 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 11 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Not necessarily.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 11 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Still, let's go give everyone a warm welcome before we kick off.

;(The scene transitions to the middle of the stadium)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I believe we're all warmed up. Now, take your positions.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' This iteration of the Pilgrimage is the perfect chance for us to bid farewell to the past. Now, go forth and soar, faster, higher, stronger &mdash; become a better version of yourself.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Remember what brought you here, and keep pushing forward. This tournament begins... now!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright! Ready or not, here I come!

:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 balam 01.ogg}} '''Balam:''' There's Mualani, a natural sports star! She's not going to stop scoring anytime soon!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I've got this!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' This round's in the bag!

:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Time to leave them all in the dust.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 balam 02.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Kinich is coming up to the trickiest parts of the course here, but is he slowing down? NO! He's SPEEDING UP! Amazing!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 fighterb 01.ogg}} '''Contestant:''' How's he so fast!?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' See you later.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 balam 03.ogg}} '''Balam:''' The gap between our competitors has increased significantly! Could this mean...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Hah!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 balam 04.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Ooh! Contestant Kachina has suddenly appeared from the side!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' This part's rough... but I won't give up!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ugh! So annoying...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 12 balam 05.ogg}} '''Balam:''' The competition has entered its final phase! Who will emerge victorious? We're about to find out!
;(The top competitors are shown fighting in solo battles)
;(The camera focuses on the final face-off, Kinich vs. [[Nlteego]])
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Got you!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 finalfighter 01.ogg}} '''Nlteego:''' Aghhh!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Well? Do you yield?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 finalfighter 02.ogg}} '''Nlteego:''' I... I...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 finalfighter 03.ogg}} '''Nlteego:''' *sigh* I yield!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Our champion has emerged! And his name is... Kinich!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 together 01.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Kinich! Kinich!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's amazing! Woohoo!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Yeah, that's our Kinich! I knew he'd win!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' What!? So not only is the little punk hard to kill, but he's good at fighting too? Hmph. Guess he does have some skill...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 finalfighter 04.ogg}} '''Nlteego:''' You beat me fair and square, Kinich... People always talk about how tough you are, and now I can say for sure: they're not exaggerating.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 finalfighter 05.ogg}} '''Nlteego:''' It's funny, I was thinking to myself earlier that I might have a shot at winning this... unless I have to face Kinich in the final.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowda 02.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Come on, dude! What are you talking about?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowdb 01.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Pfft, losing to Kinich isn't really a loss at all!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowdc 01.ogg}} '''Audience:''' You've more than proven yourself, too! You could beat me up thirty times over!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Ha. Hear that? They're recognizing your strength as well.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Keep up the good work. Let's have a rematch sometime.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 finalfighter 06.ogg}} '''Nlteego:''' Yeah!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They're both so good... But wait, if that's the end, where's Xbalanque?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Wait, aren't we missing someone? Ah! Lord Xbalanque!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Now that you mention it... Where is he? Don't tell me...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' What's with the looks on your faces? I might have won, but I'm not Xbalanque.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Huh!? Are you saying that you BEAT Xbalanque, then? Urgh, just kill me now! Better death than to suffer this torture! What a joke!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hmm. You might be onto something... I've never met our runner-up before. So... Where did you get this good?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowda 03.ogg}} '''Audience:''' That's impossible, right? Could he have placed so well because of some connection with Lord Xbalanque?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You mean... He might be Xbalanque?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 finalfighter 07.ogg}} '''Nlteego:''' Wait, I'm Xbalanque now? Heh, that's news to me.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowdb 02.ogg}} '''Audience:''' I've got it! Lord Xbalanque didn't want to steal anyone's thunder, so he must've lost the tournament on purpose!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowda 04.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Wait, that doesn't make any sense. This is the most holy Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame! How could anyone throw a match?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, did Paimon say something wrong? Now everyone's talking about Xbalanque...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still, that guy was almost too good, wasn't he? We've never heard of him before, but he was still going toe to toe with Kinich. Could he really be...?
:{{DIcon}} ...
;(Mavuika walks towards the middle of the crowd)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What are you looking at, Mavuika?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've felt that something was off since the tournament began.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Reflecting back on it, it wasn't because I could sense Xbalanque's power, but rather that... I could not.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Does she mean that Xbalanque is not present? Or... does she mean that he wasn't resurrected in his original form?)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Please, excuse me.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Wait, she's going... straight in the direction of the other contestants?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' There you are.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kidfighter 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No unimaginably strong soul aura, nor any whiff of extraordinary power...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But I know, beyond any doubt, that you are Xbalanque himself.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kidfighter 02.ogg}} '''???:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowda 05.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Huuuuuuh!?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowda 06.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Wh&mdash;Who's that? I've never seen him before...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowdb 03.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Isn't that [[Mausau]]? Like, [[Tawto]]'s grandson? When did he sign up for the tournament? Did he even fight anyone out on the field?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowdc 03.ogg}} '''Audience:''' What are you talking about? He's been standing there this whole time. I totally thought he was just there to cheer the others on...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Wait, so THAT'S Xbalanque? But... he's just a kid...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kidfighter 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Ahem...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Hah! HA! Well, this kid doesn't look like he can take a single punch from the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw! Just give me one second, and I'll...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 finalfighter 08.ogg}} '''Nlteego:''' Huh? That's Lord Xbalanque? But... I mean, he was right next to me for most of the tournament. And he didn't seem very, well... Xbalanque to me...
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kidfighter 04.ogg}} '''???:''' ...You recognized me? Perceptive. No less than expected of this era's Pyro Archon.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Forgive me for asking, but how did you do in the latest tournament?
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 kidfighter 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Haha, I didn't even make it to the final 32.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowda 07.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Noooooo!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowdc 04.ogg}} '''Audience:''' This is a joke, right? It has to be! It's clearly staged!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 crowdb 04.ogg}} '''Audience:''' Out of my way! I've got to see Lord Xbalanque for myself!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As expected, your return has caused quite the commotion.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Less talking, more doing! Hurry up and take Lord Xbalanque to a safe place. I've got this place covered.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Please remain calm, everyone. Lord Xbalanque is one of the most important people in all of Natlan. I will take responsibility for receiving him into our midst.
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You heard our Archon! Just leave this to her. Don't worry, we'll let you know as soon as we know more!
;(Mavuika looks in the Traveler's direction and flicks her eyes towards Xbalanque)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Mavuika seems to be signaling Paimon and I to follow her...?)
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, she's calling us! Quick, let's go!
:{{A|vo mwklq002 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Wait up!
