==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Glory:''' I don't recognize that voice... Are you a traveler from afar?
:'''Glory:''' Though I can't see, I'm always here to listen if there's anything you need.
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror... ''
:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Glory:''' I obviously couldn't see what happened in Mondstadt when Stormterror attacked, so I only know what other people have told me.
::'''Glory:''' People's voices were full of fear during that time, but recently the sounds of anguish have finally died down.
::'''Glory:''' Mondstadt's wind, too, has finally calmed down again.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Glory:''' Sorry, where are my manners! Allow me to introduce myself &mdash; I'm Glory.
::'''Glory:''' I come here often, waiting for Godwin to come back... I pray he manages to avoid those rotten hilichurls and the [[Abyss Order]] on the way... so he can come back and be with me soon.
::'''Glory:''' Ah, I'm rambling again... Sorry, it's just so nice having someone to talk to.
::{{DIcon}} Who is Godwin?
:::'''Glory:''' He's the man I love. He's with the Knights, and he's away with Grand Master [[Varka]]'s expedition.
:::'''Glory:''' It was hard to let him go, but I was so proud of him managing to join Varka's expedition party.
:::'''Glory:''' ...Sadly, I don't know when the expedition is supposed to end. All I can do is wait here for him.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the hilichurls and the Abyss Order.
:::'''Glory:''' You must find them a nuisance too? All they do is go {{sic|round}} causing mischief.
:::'''Glory:''' I heard that most of the hilichurls suddenly appeared in [[Teyvat]] out of nowhere several hundred years ago... And the same for the Abyss Order, actually.
:::'''Glory:''' Some said they were borne of some great catastrophe that descended on Teyvat... But I think they probably came from outer space!
:::'''Glory:''' ...Sorry, because I can't see my imagination sometimes runs a bit wild. Just ignore it.
:{{DIcon}} It must be difficult not being able to see.
::'''Glory:''' Yes... Especially at the beginning, it was hard to adjust.
::'''Glory:''' But when you can't see, your sense of hearing becomes stronger. Now, when the wind brushes past my ears, I can almost picture certain things in my mind's eye...
::'''Glory:''' And since putting my faith in Lord Barbatos, I sometimes hear the whisper of a soothing voice carried on the wind.
::'''Glory:''' My mother &mdash; or "Sister [[Grace]]" to everyone else &mdash; always tells me that Mondstadt is looked after by the Anemo [[Archon]]. I think she's right, you know.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Glory:''' Bye-bye.
::'''Glory:''' Hope you enjoy your stay in Mondstadt.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Glory:''' Huh? I recognize that voice... Traveler?
:'''Glory:''' The [[Windblume Festival|Windblume]] festivities are in full swing! If you get time, do make sure to roam around. You'll find a very different Mondstadt.
:'''Glory:''' Even better, if there's someone important to you, you should spend the festival with them. That's where the Windblume feeling truly resides...
:'''Glory:''' I always used to spend the Windblume Festival with my family and my darling Godwin. How I cherish those sweet times...
:'''Glory:''' I still don't know how he's getting on... May the winds protect him.
{{Dialogue end}}
===Of Ballads and Brews===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Glory:''' I've never heard your voice before... Are you a traveler who came here to participate in Weinlesefest?
:'''Glory:''' Welcome. I hope you enjoy the festival as much as I do.
:'''Glory:''' Although I can't see to celebrate with everyone else, this festival brings me the best news of all: that all is well with the Knights of Favonius'  expedition...
