===Wood Gathering Tips===
<noinclude>{{See also|Wood}}</noinclude>
* Each tree can yield up to three pieces of wood until its next refresh.
**A tree will refresh after chopping ten other trees.
**For example, hit the first tree, then go hit ten other trees, then come back to the first tree and it will spawn more wood.
**If the player comes back to the first tree before hitting ten other trees, then the first tree's countdown will be reset back to ten.
**Logging out and logging back in again will also cause trees to refresh.
**With this in mind, the player can cycle between eleven or more trees and continuously farm wood.
**Hit trees are tracked per player, so each player in the same world will need to hit trees in order to gather wood, but they can hit the same trees.
* All attacks done with polearm, claymore, and sword users' Normal Attack talent (Normal, Charged, and Plunge Attacks) count as chops.
**Slashes with [[Tartaglia]]'s Melee Stance do not count as chops.
**Attacks affected by [[Elemental Infusion]] and Elemental Conversion do not count as chops.
* Even if the player hits multiple trees in one attack, only one of them will drop wood.
* There is a very short cooldown between chops that drop wood.
** [[Keqing]], whose Normal Attack sequence is very fast, will only drop two wood with the first three hits in her Normal Attack if the player does not delay the hits.
** Attacks that hit twice in a row, such as the third hit in [[Rosaria]]'s Normal Attack sequence, will likely only drop one wood.
** The fourth hit in [[Xiangling]]'s Normal Attack sequence, which hits four times, can drop two wood.
* Only 2000 of each type of wood can be chopped per day.<ref>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/general-mechanics/resources-and-efficiency#wood-daily-drop-limit Wood Daily Drop Limit]</ref> Wood obtained from [[Arataki Itto]]'s passive talent [[Woodchuck Chucked]] do not count towards this cap.<ref>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/characters/geo/itto#utility-passive-woodchuck-chucked Utility Passive: Woodchuck Chucked]</ref>
* Chopping [[Cuihua Wood|Cuihua]] trees (which grow [[Sunsettia]]s, [[Apple]]s, or [[Lavender Melon]]s) allows the player to gather wood and knock fruit down at the same time.
* Some trees can't be chopped, such as overly large trees and trees with twisted trunks.
