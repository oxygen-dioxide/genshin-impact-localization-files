|text      = [[Narukami Island]] is holding the "[[Mikawa Flower Festival]]," and as you know, I've been involved in creating some games for it. It's a chance for the people of [[Watatsumi Island]] to enjoy a grand celebration with both humans and [[youkai]], while also exploring the feasibility of using games as a direction for Watatsumi Island's tourism, focusing on both the present and the future. This festival is a great opportunity for Watatsumi Island to connect with the outside world, so it's only natural that I've been putting in more effort.

The creative process has been more exhausting than I expected, with endless meetings draining my energy... But then, during a casual chat, [["Gyoubu Koban"|Gyoubu Koban]] brought up that chase game you two played, shouting, "Yellow Fur, catch me if you can!" Just picturing it made me laugh and lifted my spirits.

Would you be up for playing it again? I've prepared some directives, tweaked the rules a bit, and added some fun twists &mdash; not to compete, but to make our time together even more enjoyable. What do you say?
