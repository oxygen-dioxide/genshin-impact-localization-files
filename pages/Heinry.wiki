==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Heinry:''' And just what flavour should the next Fonta product be...?
:{{DIcon|Reward}} I'm thirsty...
::'''Heinry:''' If you're thirsty, drink Fonta! Take this bottle, please, and enjoy its refreshing taste!
::'''Heinry:''' Remember: Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fonta|x=1}})
;(Becomes available after beginning ''[[Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble]]'')
:{{DIcon}} Can I drink Fonta here?
:;(Before completing ''Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble'')
:::'''Heinry:''' Of course! Check out this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine. If you're a member of the Fontaine Research Institute, you can buy a refreshing original flavor Fonta from it with your Mora.
:::'''Heinry:''' However, if you're not a member of the institute, you won't be able to use this machine.
:;(After completing ''Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble'')
:::'''Heinry:''' Of course! Check out this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine, Honorary Senior Researcher!
:::'''Heinry:''' As long as you're a member of the Fontaine Research Institute, you can buy a refreshing original flavor Fonta here with your Mora.
:::'''Heinry:''' But, uh... You'll need to wait for me to fix it.
:;(After completing ''[[Both Brains and Brawn]]'')
:::'''Heinry:''' Of course! Check out this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine, Honorary Senior Researcher!
:::'''Heinry:''' As long as you're a member of the Fontaine Research Institute, you can buy a refreshing original flavor Fonta here with your Mora.
:::'''Heinry:''' Huh? That [[Pankration Fonta Cup|cup]] of yours... Haha. If you've got that cup then you can help yourself to unlimited Fonta. Go on, drink up! Drink to your heart's content!
::{{DIcon}} Original flavor?
::'''Heinry:''' Yes. I'm working on different flavors, each with its own unique name... But I felt the original flavor of Fonta should have its own special name too.
::'''Heinry:''' After a full and frank discussion, I decided to call it Fonta: Original. What do you think? Simple, yet powerful, right?
::{{DIcon}} You invented Fonta?
::'''Heinry:''' Huh? You honestly don't know who I am? Hahaha, okay, then allow me to introduce myself.
::'''Heinry:''' My name is Heinry, and I am a researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute, and one of the developers of Fonta. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
::'''Heinry:''' However, though I say I am a "Fontaine Research Institute researcher," I have not participated in any research for some time, and have been focused on the Fonta business itself, outside of the Institute.
::'''Heinry:''' This time, I am coming as an interim representative of Fonta Co., and wish to discuss the rebuilding of the Institute.
::'''Heinry:''' But Mr. [[Choiseul]] seemed somewhat reluctant when we started talking about funding. I don't know what he's worried about...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you talking to?
::'''Heinry:''' This Gardemek. It's this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending machine's bodyguard.
::'''Heinry:''' Umm... Although it's not operational at the moment due to some minor technical issues. But these kind of things get fixed very quickly here at the Institute.
:{{DIcon}} See you
::'''Heinry:''' Bye. And remember to drink Fonta!
