The {{Lang|'''Lingshan Clan'''|zh=灵山派|zh_rm=Língshān-pài}} is a recently formed martial arts school founded by an allegedly famous master.

==Overview==
The essence of the Lingshan Clan's kung fu is to not dodge attacks,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Crux Clash (Quest)}}</ref> instead using a special breathing exercise called "force dispersal" to harness the energy around the user and neutralize attacks without moving. The master is said to use this technique to alter the path of an attacking fist or change the direction of an incoming stone.<ref name="APTtS">{{Ref/Quest|A Path Through the Storm}}</ref>

The Lingshan Clan's master charges a tuition fee and has allegedly formed hundreds of other martial arts schools. Coupled with [[Chai Yi]] and [[Liang]]'s inability to master the skill despite prolonged training, it is likely a scam, which both [[Paimon]] and the [[Traveler]] acknowledge.<ref name="APTtS" />
