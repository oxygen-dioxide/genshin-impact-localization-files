The {{Lang|'''Lingshan Clan'''|zh=灵山派|zh_rm=Língshān-pài}} is a recently formed martial arts school by an allegedly famous master.

==Overview==
The essence of the Lingshan Clan's kung fu is to not dodge attacks. The disciples are taught a special technique called "force dispersal". It is a type of breathing exercise where the user can harness the energy around them and neutralize attacks without moving. The master is said to alter the path of an attacking fist or change the direction of an incoming stone with this technique. Despite training for ages, [[Chai Yi]] and [[Liang]] have yet to cultivate this ability.

The Lingshan Clan charges a tuition fee to its disciples.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Path Through the Storm}}</ref> Coupled with Chai Yi and Liang's inability to master the skill despite prolonged training, it is implied that the clan and its arts are not legitimate.
