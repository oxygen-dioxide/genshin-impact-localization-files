'''Stella Fortuna''' are [[Constellation Activation Material]] items used to activate the [[Constellations]] of playable characters, except for the [[Traveler]].

==How to Obtain==
Players can get a character's Stella Fortuna by obtaining a duplicate of the character from [[Wishes]].

Stella Fortuna for 4-Star characters can be obtained by other means such as buying the character from the [[Paimon's Bargains]] shop or through certain [[Events]].

In [[Aloy]]'s case, the Stella Fortuna exists in her [[Constellations]] menu, though acquiring it is not possible currently.

==Usage==
Since a character has 6 Constellation levels, Stella Fortuna can only be acquired a total of 6 times per character, which means getting the same character 7 times. Getting further duplicates of a character through Wishes will increase the [[Masterless Starglitter]] obtained from 2 to 5 for 4-Star characters and 10 to 25 for 5-Star characters.

Each character has their own version of Stella Fortuna, and despite sharing the same icon, Stella Fortuna of the same quality cannot be used interchangeably (e.g. [[Diluc]]'s Stella Fortuna cannot be used to unlock [[Klee]]'s Constellation levels and vice-versa) nor is there a version of Stella Fortuna that can be used on any character.

The Traveler's equivalent to Stella Fortuna are the [[Memories]].

==Lore==
Stella Fortuna are genuine celestial bodies in the sky of Teyvat. They make up the constellations that are associated with [[Vision]] bearers.

In ''[[Unreconciled Stars]]'', the Stella Fortuna in [[Leonard]]'s constellation fell from the sky as meteors, but the cause of this phenomenon is yet unknown. Those meteors were found to contain concentrated [[element]]al energy, as well as the spirit and memories of Leonard. It is unclear if this is the case for all Stella Fortuna, although it is logically likely.
