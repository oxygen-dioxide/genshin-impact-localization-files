'''Mushrooms''' are a [[Cooking Ingredient]] commonly found in the wild all over [[Teyvat]].

==How to Obtain==
Mushrooms grow on all kinds of terrains throughout Teyvat, and are most common in [[Mondstadt]] and in [[Liyue]]'s [[Bishui Plain]] & [[Qiongji Estuary]] areas.

See the Video Guides section or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=162 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Mushrooms after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
*[[Zhonglin]] in [[Wangshu Inn]], [[Liyue]] (6 Mushrooms)
