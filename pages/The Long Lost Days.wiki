==Trivia==
* This soundtrack cannot immediately play upon entering the part of the Nameless Ruins subarea near "The Two Strange Bells" as ''Ripples of the Past'' is guaranteed to play instead. ''The Long Lost Days'' will then play on loop after ''Ripples of the Past'' finishes playing or after exiting combat.
