|text      = We've got a tricky situation on our hands, today's my birthday... Oh, sorry, I'm not trying to say birthdays are tricky!

I had originally planned just to have a simple birthday... but Genta and Akira came up with the idea of the entire Arataki Gang going to Watatsumi Island for a day trip to celebrate. Of course, when the boss heard, he was even more ecstatic...

But I know that the Arataki Gang has no camping equipment whatsoever and is completely unfamiliar with Watatsumi Island. If we just head on over, who knows what kind of trouble we'll get ourselves into... So, I'd like to ask the trustworthy and dependable you to go with us.

Though the boys can certainly get a bit rowdy, they're first-class when it comes to cheering someone up and providing entertainment. So come with us, if you're there, this'll be a trip to remember.
