<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Radomir is a soldier of the Ninth Company, sent to [[The Chasm]] to fight the darkness underneath, although the company scattered following their device's explosion. Radomir remained with [[Anton]] alongside fellow soldiers [[Danila]] and [[Temur]]. After learning that they were no longer welcome in [[Liyue]], Radomir worried over who would protect the people of Liyue from the darkness, but Anton insisted on retreating which he reluctantly agreed to. Nonetheless, he thanked the Traveler for the food and hoped that they would meet again in the future as friends.
