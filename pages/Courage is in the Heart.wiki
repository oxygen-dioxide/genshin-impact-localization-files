==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You found a journal by the Aranara named Arashakun in an Aranara house. Despite losing "courage," Arashakun still decided to venture into such a dangerous place. Go check the situation out...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the Aranara house)
:'''Paimon:''' This seems familiar to Paimon, (Traveler). This was in one of Aranara's paintings.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, why are there so many hilichurls surrounding that house!?

;(After defeating the hilichurls)
:;(Obtain [[Florescent Talisman]])
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? These hilichurls dropped something strange...
:'''Paimon:''' It seems to be made out of flowers. Weird, but these flowers are ordinary and were picked quite some time ago, yet they still haven't wilted.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can sense quite a lot of Dendro energy on it, and it's been discarded here, too...
:{{DIcon}} It must belong to Aranara.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, must be.
:{{DIcon}} It might be from a Dendro hilichurl...
::'''Paimon:''' What are you saying? It must be from an Aranara who lives here.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmmm, this flower thing has so much Dendro energy that it didn't even wither in the hands of the hilichurls.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they carried it with them all the time.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it's something very precious.
:'''Paimon:''' Yep, let's return this to the Aranara as soon as possible.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go inside the house, (Traveler). Maybe whoever lost it is super bummed out right now!

;(Investigate jar outside house)
:'''Paimon:''' This house doesn't seem to have been occupied by any person... Err, Paimon means, any Aranara, in a while...

;(Investigate vegetable bag outside house)
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, is anybody here?
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like no one's here...

;(Read the Inconsistently-Written Notes)
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' (The first few pages contain very small and scribbled writing...)
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "Ohhh... I can't believe there is a Nara willing to be Arashakun's friend. What a good Nara! The good Nara didn't mind timid Arashakun, and even taught Arashakun how to write Nara words..."
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "...Good Nara comforted Arashakun when Arashakun was frightened by a leaf that fell on his head. Good Nara is Arashakun's friend forever!"
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' (The handwriting becomes tinier and more flustered in the following pages...)
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "Oh no... Nara friend was taken by Furry Mask Demon King! It has such long arms. So scary..."
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "But... must save Nara... Ohh..."
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' (The following pages are written in big, forceful handwriting...)
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "The Furry Mask Demon King has been defeated! Saved Nara friend, and Nara friend gave Arashakun 'courage'! Arashakun is not the same old timid Arashakun anymore."
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "Arashakun has 'courage' now and bravely fought the furry masked monsters. No Nara nearby will ever have to worry about getting bullied by the [[Hilichurls|furry masked monsters again]]!"
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' (The handwriting shrinks back down in the latest pages...)
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "Oh no... How did this happen? Arashakun's 'courage' is missing... The 'courage' Nara gave to Arashakun... It must have been stolen by the Furry Mask Demon King."
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "Furry Mask Demon King, arms very long, very scary. But Arashakun can do nothing after losing his 'courage'... Arashakun will go looking for it {{Color|buzzword|in the cave to the east}}..."
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, so, is "Arashakun" the Aranara who wrote all this?
:'''Paimon:''' The writing in this journal is big at times and real tiny at others. The big letters are fine, but...
:'''Paimon:''' Gotta say, the small ones hurt Paimon's eyes a little.
:{{DIcon}} Our little Paimon's having trouble reading those small letters?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Paimon reads letters in normal size just fine, thank you! Paimon's just not used to reading tiny letters, that's all!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmmm, did this Arashakun not return after writing these most recent pages...?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's check out that cave in the east. The journal said that his courage is missing... Can "courage" really go missing? Paimon's curious...
----
;(Approach the inside of the cave)
:'''???:''' *sob*... Help me, help me! Please, can someone out there save Arashakun from this scary cave?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? (Traveler), did you hear that? It sounds like someone's calling for help!

;(Talk to Arashakun after killing the Hydro slime)
: '''Paimon:''' Are you Arashakun?
: '''Arashakun:''' *sob*... Arashakun is indeed my name... Eek, don't come so close so quickly!
: '''Arashakun:''' Arashakun's very grateful to you two for saving me, but I must still request that you keep a certain distance... *sob*
: '''Arashakun:''' That will make Arashakun feel a bit more comfortable...
: '''Paimon:''' What? We just rescued you!
: '''Arashakun:''' I'm sorry! Sorry for my rude request. Sorry for angering you...
: '''Arashakun:''' But I've been trapped here and am still... I&mdash;I haven't settled down yet. *sob* Please forgive me...
: '''Paimon:''' It's okay, it's okay...
: '''Arashakun:''' Okay, thank you. May Arashakun get your names?
: '''Paimon:''' It's Paimon.
: {{DIcon}} I'm (Traveler).
: '''Arashakun:''' Golden Nara (Traveler) and Paimon... So, how come you know Arashakun's name?
: {{DIcon}} We read the journal in the house.
: '''Arashakun:''' Golden-haired Nara (Traveler) read the journal and came looking for Arashakun? Then rescued trapped Arashakun? Nara is so kind and so powerful.
: '''Arashakun:''' *sob* If Arashakun hadn't lost "courage," Arakashun wouldn't have been so helpless...
: '''Paimon:''' We read about that in the journal. What did you mean by missing "courage," Arashakun?
: '''Arashakun:''' This is a story from long, long ago...
: '''Arashakun:''' Many moons ago, Arashakun was just like the Arashakun now, without "courage." Back then, even the sound of a twig snapping would keep Arashakun up at night...
: '''Arashakun:''' But even timid Arashakun had a Nara friend for a companion. That Nara friend was no mighty [[Nara Varuna]], but was still a very good Nara!
: '''Arashakun:''' He never teased timid Arashakun. When Arashakun felt scared, he would hold Arashakun's hand. He was a friend Arashakun would never forget.
: '''Arashakun:''' But one day, that Nara was taken by the Furry Mask Demon King...
: '''Paimon:''' Wait, what's this Furry Mask Demon King you speak of?
: '''Arashakun:''' Furry Mask Demon King is a furry demon king wearing a mask.
: '''Paimon:''' Uh, yeah, sure...
:{{DIcon}} Do you know what it is, Paimon?
::'''Paimon:''' There's no way Paimon would know that...
:{{DIcon}} That's a very Aranara answer...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon has no clue what this Furry Mask Demon King could be...
: '''Paimon:''' But the Furry Mask Demon King captured Arashakun's friend.
: '''Arashakun:''' The Furry Mask Demon King was very cunning. Just thinking about it makes Arashakun shudder.
: '''Arashakun:''' *sob*... When Nara friend was taken, Arashakun was afraid of getting beat up by the Furry Mask Demon King, but was even more terrified of never seeing Nara friend again.
: '''Arashakun:''' So Arashakun tried very hard! Closed eyes! Gritted teeth! Used hands and hit, and hit! Then saved Nara friend.
: '''Arashakun:''' After that, Nara friend used flowers to make a "Talisman of Courage" and told Arashakun, "Arashakun is a good Aranara with courage, not a timid Aranara!"
:'''Arashakun:''' So from the on, Arashakun had "courage."
:'''Paimon:''' But wasn't "Closed eyes! Gritted teeth! Used hands and hit, and hit, and hit!" very courageous?
:'''Arashakun:''' No. Arashakun only had "courage" after getting it from Nara friend.
:'''Paimon:''' But your act to save your friend was already brave.
:'''Arashakun:''' No, no, no. Arashakun was so scared when saving Nara friend. Arms and legs, all shaky. But after getting "courage," Arashakun's arms and legs were not weak anymore.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah...
:{{DIcon}} The talisman was just a symbol.
:{{DIcon}} The courage was in you all along!
:'''Arashakun:''' *sob*... Nara (Traveler) is making this too complicated. Arashakun just know that there is "courage" only when I have the "Talisman of Courage."
:'''Arashakun:''' After "courage" was stolen, Arashakun came to the cave of the Furry Mask Demon King to search, hoping to find clues for Arashakun to find "courage" again.
:'''Arashakun:''' But Arashakun ended up getting surrounded by slimes in the cave... Fortunately, the Furry Mask Demon King didn't notice.
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which... Remember that thing we picked up from the hilichurls, (Traveler)? Do you think that's the talisman?
:'''Paimon:''' Arashakun, we might have found the courage you lost!
:'''Arashakun:''' Really? Have you really found Arashakun's "courage," Nara (Traveler) and Paimon?
:'''Arashakun:''' *sob*... Would Nara (Traveler) mind giving my "courage" back to me...?
:;(Submit Florescent Talisman)
{{Quest Description|Regaining "courage" has turned Arashakun into a different Aranara. Now, it is time to defeat the Furry Mask Demon King together with Arashakun!}}
;(Talk to Arashakun)
:'''Arashakun:''' Yes, this is it, this is it!
:'''Arashakun:''' This is the "Talisman of Courage"! The flower has faded a bit after being apart from Arashakun for a few days.
:'''Arashakun:''' But it's okay! Arashakun will guard it well from now on!
:'''Arashakun:''' "Arashakun is a good Aranara with courage, not a timid Aranara!"
:'''Arashakun:''' Thank you so much, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon!
:'''Arashakun:''' Arashakun now has "courage" back. Nothing can stop me! I beat Furry Mask Demon King once before and I shall do it again!
:'''Paimon:''' (Whoa, Arashakun's attitude and tone are completely different now.)
:'''Arashakun:''' The Furry Mask Demon King has done a lot of evil things. Please come with me, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon. With your help, we'll defeat it for sure!
:'''Arashakun:''' Arashakun can feel it. Today... will be the day it meets its end!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay then, (Traveler), let's go and see what on earth that Furry Mask Demon King is supposed to be!
----
;(Upon reaching a group of Hilichurls)
:'''Arashakun:''' Come out, "Furry Mask Demon King"! Arashakun challenges you to a battle this day!

;(After defeating the group of Hilichurls, a Hilichurl Berserker appears)
:'''Paimon:''' That must be the "Furry Mask Demon King."
:'''Arashakun:''' That's it! With Nara (Traveler) and Paimon here, we can definitely take it down with ease!

;(After defeating the Hilichurl Berserker)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon had her guesses... But as it turns out, the Furry Mask Demon King really was a hilichurl all along.
:'''Arashakun:''' A hilichurl?
:'''Paimon:''' Yes, the "Furry Mask Demon King" is actually a hilichurl.
:'''Arashakun:''' Are all Hillychuchu "Furry Mask Demon Kings"?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, no...
:{{DIcon}} But that's all you need to know, Arashakun.
:'''Arashakun:''' Okay, Arashakun understands.
:'''Arashakun:''' Yes, with help from Nara (Traveler) and Paimon, Arashakun will lead the charge and be invincible! Even the devious Furry Mask Demon King will be no match!
:'''Arashakun:''' Arashakun shall mark today with a big entry!
:{{DIcon}} A big entry...?
:'''Arashakun:''' Yeah, a big entry in big writing!
:'''Paimon:''' Arashakun with "courage" and without sure feel like two completely different Aranara.
:'''Arashakun:''' Arashakun with no "courage" has weak arms and legs, but Arashakun with "courage" can do all sort of amazing feats!
:'''Arashakun:''' "Courage" is not just the best gift from Nara friend, but also the most important thing to Arashakun.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, make sure you keep it safe and don't let the hilichurls steal it again!
:'''Arashakun:''' Arashakun understands. Arashakun will never let "courage" go missing again!
:;(Quest ends)
----
;(Talk to Arashakun again at the house)
:'''Arashakun:''' As long as Arashakun has "courage," Arashakun won't be scared no matter how many "masked monsters" come! They will never steal "courage" again! Arashakun won't allow that!
:{{DIcon}} Actually, courage can never be stolen...
::'''Arashakun:''' ?
::'''Arashakun:''' But after "courage" was stolen, Arashakun felt weak in hands and feet...
::{{DIcon}} The courage is rooted in your heart...
::'''Arashakun:''' Hmm... what Nara (Traveler) said, is hard to understand...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, so be careful with it...
::'''Arashakun:''' Arashakun will!

;(Read Inconsistently-Written Notes again)
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' (The most recent page of Arashakun's journal is written in huge letters.)
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "With the help of the amazing Golden Nara (Traveler) and Paimon, Arashakun found 'courage' again!"
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "Not just that, we also destroyed the Furry Mask Demon King together!"
:'''Inconsistently-Written Notes:''' "Nara (Traveler) is also a brave and kind Nara!"
