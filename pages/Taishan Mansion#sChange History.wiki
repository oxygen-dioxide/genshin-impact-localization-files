**{{Color|Old description:}} Once, people who sought '''to join''' the adepti '''must''' pass the trials of heavens and earth. Taishan Mansion served as the trial of "earth'''".''' Now that the adepti have long departed from this realm, Taishan Mansion has also turned into a common treasure trove.
**{{Color|New description:}} Once, people who sought '''the path of''' the adepti '''had to''' pass the trials of heavens and earth. Taishan Mansion served as the trial of "earth'''."'''

[[Version 1.2]]
*The domain level "Abyss of Embers", which was previously the only level available on Sunday, was removed from the game. This level used to provide a random assortment of the materials that were available on other days of the week. After the Version 1.2 update players can now pick any of the other domain levels to enter on Sunday.
