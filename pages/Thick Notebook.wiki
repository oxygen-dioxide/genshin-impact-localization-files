'''Thick Notebook''' is an optional quest item used in [[Time and Wind]]. It can be found in [[Henry Morton]]'s camp south of the [[Thousand Winds Temple]].

==Text==
The phrase "time and the wind" seems like it may have something to do with the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]]... But couldn't this fellow be clearer? What am I supposed to puzzle out with just these three words?

If it has something to do with the Anemo Archon, then whatever clues may be found should also be related to Anemo.

Then if one factors in the idea of "time..." This sundial over here should hide some secret.

Moreover, I do get an odd feeling around this place sometimes. I think it may have been 2 AM... Or was it some other time...?

I really can't remember... I only remember that sometime {{Color|buzzword|before dawn}}, the {{Color|buzzword|shadow cast by the sundial's pointer points right below it}}.

But... Well, fine. The lecturers at the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] used to say that it would be best for people without {{Color|buzzword|[[Vision]]s}} not to take part in practicum such as outdoor surveys.

I didn't understand what they meant then, but I suppose I do now. Even though I did find a clue, all I could do without a {{Color|buzzword|Vision}} is watch.

I wonder if the [[Adventurers' Guild]] can help me find someone who has a {{Color|buzzword|Vision}} and is willing to help.

Speaking of which, why is [[Mondstadt]]'s Adventurers' Guild still so tiny?
