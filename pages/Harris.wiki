:::'''Harris:''' Congratulations! You won! Let's celebrate another victory with a feast!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Harris:''' The name's Harris. I'm a chef and the person who built this camp.
::'''Harris:''' I came here to help the adventurers in the area, to make sure they can get a bowl of hot soup at the end of a long day of adventure.
::'''Harris:''' I reckon there's no greater joy than the feeling of hot soup in your system when you're just about frozen stiff.
::'''Harris:''' The essence of culinary pursuit is to bring people satisfaction and joy, is it not?
::'''Harris:''' It's a shame that lots of chefs have forgotten this... Personally, I was taught this simple principle by a [[Xiangling|young female chef]] who I met by chance while traveling in Liyue.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Harris:''' Sure! Remember, if you ever feel tired, you can always stop by to rest your feet and grab some grub!
