'''Electro Crystals''' can be found in the wild in various areas of [[Teyvat]]. They appear as a full crystal. In order to harvest them, the player must hit them with {{Pyro}} attacks to cause the [[Overloaded]] reaction, which shatters it into a single shard. While intact, Electro Crystals deal '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} around themselves every 0.5 seconds.
