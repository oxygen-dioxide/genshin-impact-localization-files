==Text==
I am immensely grateful to whoever left this food here!<br />
I'm famished, fatigued, and all out of supplies. Without this food, there is no way that I would be able to keep going.<br />
I will continue my descent down the mountain now. It shouldn't be much further to the camp.<br />
Lesson learned &mdash; in the future, prepare for each and every conceivable eventuality before thinking about setting foot on the mountain...
