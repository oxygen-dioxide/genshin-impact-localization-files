===Maintenance Log (I)===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:"Log: Switch is working properly. However, there are too many loopholes in existing patrols, and the weapons lack power. Considering that there have been several recent attacks, a security level increase is recommended."

===Maintenance Log (II)===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:"Log: The supervision here is way too lax! These pests do nothing but eat and play. In fact, they eat better than we do, and they treat the facilities like their toys."
:"Lord [[Och-Kan]] said that these pests are our enemies. I do not think that foes should be treated in such a friendly fashion!"
:"Reply: Acknowledged. Approving Party's Suggestion: No changes required. Also, it's just your first day. No need to rush into work. Please observe and learn first."

:"Reply: Due to budget constraints, no ladders can be made available, only grappling hooks. Approval Suggestion: Your body is in abysmal shape. Do more climbing &mdash; it'll come in handy later."
