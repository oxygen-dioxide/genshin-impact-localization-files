:'''Ariana:''' Compared to my hometown, the bustling life here suits me better.
:{{DIcon}} About your hometown...
::'''Ariana:''' My hometown is [[Sumeru City]]. My family is still there. I moved to Port Ormos to look after the ship.
::'''Ariana:''' The people back in Sumeru, especially the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] researchers, all walked at a pace way too leisurely for me!
::'''Ariana:''' Life here is busy, fulfilling, and more profitable &mdash; much better than back home.
::'''Ariana:''' Even the hot curry I get after work tastes better.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Curry...
:::'''Ariana:''' Yeah. Curry is one thing that everyone in Sumeru knows how to cook.
:::'''Ariana:''' Its flavor varies from family to family because every family has their own curry recipe.
:::'''Ariana:''' But most of their curry tastes great.
:::'''Ariana:''' So, would you like to have a taste of my recipe?
::;(Obtain [[Curry Shrimp]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ariana:''' See you. May you lead a fulfilling life.
