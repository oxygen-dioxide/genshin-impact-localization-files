;今天是珐露珊的生日哦，我们快去为她庆祝吧！
:'''派蒙：'''呼~珐露珊，我们找了你好久，怎么跑到这里啦。
:'''珐露珊：'''遗迹龙兽的研究有了新的想法，确认一下细节。
:'''派蒙：'''过生日也这么忙碌，我们给你做了好吃的！
:'''旅行者：'''除了北地烟熏鸡外也尝试做了一下古法秘制椰炭饼，之前你说这是一百年前须弥传统的做法，不知道有没有还原一点……

;Today is [[Faruzan]]'s birthday, let's go and celebrate with her!
:'''Paimon:''' Phew~ Faruzan, we spent so long looking for you. What are you doing out here?
:'''Faruzan:''' I came up with some new ways to research this [[Ruin Drake]]. I'm just here to confirm some of the details.
:'''Paimon:''' You sure are busy on your birthday! We made you some delicious food.
:'''Traveler:''' Besides this [[Northern Smoked Chicken]], we also tried an ancient secret recipe for [[Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake]]. Last time, you mentioned that this was the traditional preparation method in Sumeru from a hundred years ago. We're not sure if we managed to get it right...
:'''Faruzan:''' It feels pretty nice to have someone celebrate my birthday with me even after a hundred years!
