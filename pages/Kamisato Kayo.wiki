'''Kamisato Kayo''' {{Lang|ja=神里華代}} is the deceased mother of [[Kamisato Ayato]] and [[Kamisato Ayaka]] of the [[Kamisato Clan]]. She died when Ayaka was young, which prompted Ayaka to mature faster and be more involved in the clan's affairs.

Kamisato Kayo's diary and her alias, Tsubaki, are prominent parts of Kamisato Ayaka's Story Quest, [[Grus Nivis Chapter]] Act I: [[The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit]].

==Profile==
While she was alive, Kamisato Kayo took on the alter-ego of Tsubaki to dream about what life would be like if she was unburdened by the responsibilities of the Kamisato Clan and was simply an ordinary woman. As Tsubaki, she liked pretty kimonos, wished to try food from different places, and yearned to see sights she had never seen before. However, as someone of her position, she could not indulge in these ordinary things, nor could she visit a local Inazuman festival as she wanted to.

Ayaka empathized with her mother upon discovering her alter-ego, as she also felt burdened by her responsibilities and was happiest when she could live life like a normal person. Ayaka would later attend a festival to fulfill both her own and her mother's wish.
