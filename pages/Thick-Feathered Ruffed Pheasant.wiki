|description = A medium-sized bird that can be found in Natlan. It wears a luxurious coat of brilliant green feathers, seemingly with a delicate, silky ruff, while its tail feathers are as gorgeous as budding flowers.<br>Perhaps on account of its all-too-luxuriant feathers, akin to a field of flammable flowers, this bird is still afraid of fire, despite living in Natlan's heat. In addition, while other birds may appear fluffy but are actually quite sturdy, what the Thick-Feathered Ruffed Pheasant has beneath its thick feathers is... a very thick, round layer of fat. Thus, it strains itself even by flying normally, and has been called a "Potted plant with wings that can't fly" by the Scions of the Canopy...
