|text1    = Within these ruins, there are strange, water-colored energy flows, that seem to follow established "channels" as they flow along.<br>Additionally, there are devices on the tracks that can gather these energy flows. These strange devices can even use {{color|help|lifts}} to transfer these flows to high or lower-level "channels." The final goal seems to be to guide this energy into the {{color|help|large machine in the middle}} of the ruins.
