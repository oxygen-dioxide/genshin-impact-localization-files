'''Alice''' is [[Klee]]'s mother, as well as a famous adventurer who authored the [[Teyvat Travel Guide]]. She is a polymath whose skills include [[alchemy]], astrology, engineering, magic, and medicine. Additionally, she is an elder within the [[Hexenzirkel]], an organization which both [[Mona]] and [[Mona's Master]] also belong to.

While Alice has not yet been met in-person, she was directly involved in setting up the [[Version 1.6]] event ''[[Midsummer Island Adventure]]'' and left a phonograph record with a message from her for the event's attendees to find. She was also involved in sending the party to the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] again in [[Version 2.8]]'s event, ''[[Summertime Odyssey]]'', although she does not seem to have a hand in the events that occur afterwards.

==Profile==
{{Quote|As well-versed in astrology as she was, my master knew only astrology. Alice, on the other hand, was skilled in a great many other mystical fields.|[[Mona]]|[[A Bewildering Fate]]}}
Alice is an adventurer who belongs to a long-lived race and is at least 500 years old herself. She has allegedly seen the entire world and possibly even beyond, based on the description of [[Wings of Feasting]], her reference to the {{w|Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon}},<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Heavenly Stone's Debris}}</ref> and her narration of [[Aloy]]'s [[Collected Miscellany]] in [[Dainsleif]]'s place.<ref name="Aloy Misc">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/bx2aWuUjxnE Collected Miscellany - "Aloy: Mystical Glow of Frost"]</ref> While it is unclear what Alice does on her adventures besides satisfying her personal curiosity, she comments that ''"Teyvat's borders have grown fragile these past two years — looks like Mommy's going to have to get busy"'' as to why she had to quickly leave her family again after delivering the Wings of Feasting.

Alice's immense magical prowess is such that [[Albedo]] calls her a "night-omnipotent sorceress," while [[Diluc]] states that she is the only other person besides [[Venti]], the mortal form of the Anemo Archon [[Barbatos]], who could have arranged the events at the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] during ''Midsummer Island Adventure''.<ref name="mia tfr">{{Ref/Quest|The Final Riddle: A Secret Uncovered}}</ref> Mona also speaks favorably of Alice's skillset and sought out Alice's successor &mdash; Klee &mdash; in hopes that their combined knowledge would be enough to read the [[Traveler]]'s fate, failing to anticipate the possibility that Alice had not passed any of her magical skills on to Klee.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Bewildering Fate}}</ref> She also states that the [[Narukami Pillar]]s on [[Yashiori Island]], which suppress the [[Tatarigami]] and were allegedly created by the [[Raiden Shogun]], were created with techniques that are "quite familiar to [her]."

Alice touts a commendable number of skills and contributions to the world of Teyvat, which includes but is not limited to:
*Astrology
*Alchemy
*Creating puzzles and Hydro Barriers throughout the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]]<ref name="mia tfr" />
*Explosives-crafting<ref name="ttg mond">{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|1|title=Mondstadt}}</ref>
**Creating [[Dodoco]], an explosive doll which she taught Klee how to make<ref>{{Ref/CS|Klee|"Dodoco"}}</ref>
*Inventing a [["Witch's Chorus"|phonograph]]
*Inventing the [[Temari]] game<ref name="Aloy Misc" />
*Potion-concocting<ref name="ttg liyue">{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|2|title=Liyue}}</ref>
*Testing various scientific endeavors and engineering projects, although most of her known attempts ended in failure<ref name="ttg mond" />
*Inventing a [[Dodocommunication Device|long-distance instant communication device]]

===Personality===
Alice is a free-spirited person who exercises little restraint and acts impulsively. She blew up parts of [[Stormterror's Lair]] because she felt that the ruins didn't seem ancient enough,<ref name="ttg mond" /> and concocted a potion to cure [[Echo]]'s stutter, only to leave him with the side effect of only being able to imitate others around him.<ref name="ttg liyue" /> Both [[Jean]] and [[Albedo]] remark that Klee takes after her mother in many ways, with Albedo commenting that his only relief is that Klee is not yet as destructive as Alice.

Despite her impulsiveness, Alice is also quite powerful and intelligent, taking inspiration from her adventures to draft various ideas and experiments. She also dotes on Klee a great deal and Klee, in turn, adores her. Alice devised [[Dodoco]] after observing [[Amber]]'s [[Baron Bunny]] and designed an entire fictional story revolving around it for Klee to enjoy, going as far as to arrange the events at the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] and invite several people whom Klee is close with for a summer vacation. She also secretly checks in on Klee at Mondstadt while she performs her job.<ref name="mia tfr" />

Alongside doting on her real daughter, Alice shows her maternal side to those who treat Klee well. She insisted that Albedo call her "mother" (to which he refused) and decided that he was now part of their family.<ref name="Albedo 2">{{Ref/CS|Albedo|2}}</ref> Following [[Crepus]]' death several years ago, Alice sent [[Diluc]] a condolence letter in which she also insisted on treating him like her own child due to the way he had cared for Klee in the past.<ref name="HS2">{{Ref/Quest|All's Well That Ends Well (Quest)|note=A Tidily Written Letter}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Alice has long elf-like ears like Klee does.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Golden Apple Vacation Returns!}}</ref>

==Story==
===History===
Alice became acquainted with the [[Khaenri'ah]]n alchemist [[Rhinedottir]] at an unknown point in the past; the two have a close enough bond that Rhinedottir later sent [[Albedo]], her apprentice and creation, to seek Alice out for help with his final assignment. Alice, in turn, brought him to the [[Knights of Favonius]] in [[Mondstadt]], believing they had the resources to build a large research lab for him.<ref name="Albedo 2" />

Centuries ago, Alice encountered an otherworldly outlander in Teyvat, which was the last time such an outlander appeared before Aloy's arrival.<ref name="Aloy Misc" /> She became acquainted with [[Yae Miko]] at some point, calling the over 500-year-old kitsune a "little girl" and recounts in the Inazuma edition of the ''Teyvat Travel Guide'' how easy it was to make Miko cry. Alice also mentions [[Asase Hibiki]] as "that killjoy shrine maiden" and [[Neko]] as "that fat cat," further indicating that she traveled to [[Inazuma]] after the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago.<ref name="ttg inazuma">{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|3|Inazuma}}</ref>

Fifty years ago, Alice made a pact with her friend and rival, [[Mona's Master]], resulting in Alice taking possession of her diary,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Astrology and the 50-Year Pact}}</ref> which Alice in turn eventually left in Klee's care.

At some point in time, Alice met Klee's father, another renowned adventurer, during her travels.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Klee|About the Parents}}</ref> They had Klee, and decided to stay in Mondstadt for a while to raise her. Around this time, Albedo sought her out at Rhinedottir's behest, leading Alice to take the boy in and insist on treating each other as a "real family,"<ref name="Albedo 2" /> further insisting that Albedo refer to her as "mother." Alice also imparted [[Barbara]] with the "Idol Magazine," inspiring the young deaconess to become an "idol" for Alice's "Teyvat Idols!" group, although the group never came to fruition due to recruitment troubles.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Barbara|Alice's Idol Magazine}}</ref><ref name="ttg inazuma" />

Sometime after Crepus died four years before the game's start, Klee noticed Diluc's disappearance, which prompted Alice to look into the matter. After finding out about Crepus' passing, Alice sent Diluc a lengthy letter to express her condolences and give him words of encouragement.<ref name="HS2" /> Three years before the game's start, Alice and Klee's father went to travel "somewhere dangerous and far away," and entrusted Klee to Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.<ref name="Klee 1">{{Ref/CS|Klee|1}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Klee|5}}</ref>

Alice began writing the Teyvat Travel Guide in the recent past, documenting notable areas and features in her travels, although its highly personal and subjective writing style make the work read more like her personal diary rather than an actual travel guide. The Mondstadt and [[Liyue]] editions began circulating some time ago, as [[Jifang]] of the [[Wanwen Bookhouse]] claims the Liyue edition has been out-of-print for some time due to its unpopularity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Justice, for Books' Sake}}</ref>

The Mondstadt edition was likely written shortly after Alice's arrival in Mondstadt, before raising Klee. During that time, she observed Amber's Baron Bunny and was inspired to build an explosive doll, which eventually became known as Dodoco. She also became known for performing aerobatic stunts after launching herself with an [[Anemo Slime]], only to receive a Gliding Violation from Jean.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Glide With the Wind}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Gliding Instruction Manual}}</ref>

While writing the Liyue edition, Alice became acquainted with [[Zhongli]], whom she described as "the sternest person" she knows. She also cured [[Echo]] of his stutter, but the potion's side-effects cause him to be compelled to perfectly imitate those around him, which he is still afflicted by to this day.<ref name="ttg liyue" /><ref name="echo">{{Ref/NPC|Xinghuo}}</ref>

While the Inazuma edition was first published during the [[Irodori Festival]], its contents set Alice's experiences as occurring shortly before the outbreak of war a year ago. She attempted to recruit [[Kamisato Ayaka]] for "Teyvat Idols!", only to be rebuffed at least six times, and befriended [[Yoimiya]].<ref name="ttg inazuma" />

===Present Day===
Shortly before the events of [[Version 1.6]], Alice found the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] and thought of Klee. As a gift to her and to the people who were taking care of her, she decided to dress-up the islands, leaving behind various gadgets and games to turn it into a "summer park" for everyone to enjoy. In order to get everyone to come, she concocted a plan of leaving behind threatening letters, encouraging them to go to the island to deal with a fictional enemy, called
'Dodo-King.' However, once the last puzzle was dealt with, the truth was revealed through one of Alice's inventions, which she calls the "Alice Phonograph." She explained herself and the island and that she was already exploring another area in Teyvat.<ref name="mia tfr" />

Sometime later, Alice returned to Mondstadt to visit Klee. During the trip, she ran into [[Venti]] and gave him a [[Dodocommunication Device]] to give to a friend of his, which he would give to the Traveler.

==Trivia==
* Alice is familiar with Earth culture, introducing idol culture to Barbara via a magazine and having previously made statements about the {{w|Rubicon}}, with the implied context of the real-life phrase "{{w|crossing the Rubicon}}."
** While the Wings of Feasting were developed as part of a collaboration between [[miHoYo]] and {{w|KFC}}, and its description is narrated by Alice, the explanation for the Wings' appearance claims they originally had a blue-and-white color scheme which Alice later modified to be red-and-white to fit her family's tastes, rather than innately having KFC's red and white brand colors.

====Etymology====
*Alice and her daughter, Klee, are of a race blessed with longevity<ref name="mia tfr" /> and have pointed, {{w|Elf|elf-like ears}}. However, the name of their race and whether or not [[Teyvat]] has a name for their race is currently unknown.
** During ''[[The Final Riddle: A Secret Uncovered]]'', the Chinese equivalent for [[Kaeya]]'s comment about how Alice and Klee are "kindred spirits, both wild and free" is "母女俩都是自由自在的精灵" ("The mother and daughter both are free and unfettered ''jīnglíng''"). {{Lang|mini=1|zh_rm=''Jīnglíng''|zh=精灵}} primarily refers to supernatural entities in a broad sense, such as elves, spirits, and fairies.<ref>MDBG Word Dictionary: [https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=%E7%B2%BE%E7%81%B5 精灵]</ref>
*** In the field of European legends and fantasy, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=精灵|zh_rm=jīnglíng}} mainly refers to elves,<ref name="elf_wt">Wikitionary: {{wt|精靈||Chinese}}</ref><ref>Chinese Wikipedia: [https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B2%BE%E9%9D%88 精靈《维基百科》]</ref> {{Lang|mini=1|zh=灵|zh_rm=líng}} to spirits,<ref name="elf_wt" /> and ''xiǎoxiānzi'' (小仙子) to fairies.<ref name="elf_wt" /> That said, ''jīnglíng'' has previously been used to describe [[Barbatos]] before he became [[Archon]], and [[Paimon]]. For Barbatos, it was translated as both "elf"<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Amos' Bow|Lore}}</ref> and "spirit."<ref>{{Ref/Book|Biography of Gunnhildr|quote=English: "[...] a spirit from the midst of the myriad winds [...]"<br />Chinese: {{Lang|mini=1|zh=千风之中的精灵|zh_tl=A ''jīnglíng'' amidst the thousand winds}}}}</ref> For Paimon, it was translated as "elf."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Verr Goldet|c=before completing [[Wangshu]]}}</ref> In addition, it is used as a part of the Chinese name for the [[Lochfolk]]/Oceanid ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=纯水精灵|zh_rm=''chúnshuǐ-jīnglíng''|zh_tl=Pure Water Elemental}}). Given that none of them bear much resemblance to Klee nor to the typical depiction of an elf, translating the term ''jīnglíng'' becomes complicated.
**The Japanese version unambiguously uses the term {{Lang|mini=1|ja=エルフ|ja_rm=Erufu|ja_tl=(European) elves}} in its equivalent sentence; meanwhile, the Korean version phrases the above expression as "정말 자유로운 영혼을 가진", which roughly means "having truly free souls."
*Albedo calls Alice "Aunt,"<ref name="mia tfr" /> although not in the familial sense of the word. In Chinese, he addresses her as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=阿姨|zh_rm=āyí}}, a term which literally means "aunt" but is also used as an honorific for older women who have no blood relation to the speaker
* In the Chinese and Japanese versions, the Narukami-style rendering (Japanese-inspired name) of Eris, a historical figure in [[Enkanomiya]], is recorded by the Chinese characters {{Lang|mini=1|ja=有栖|ja_rm=Arisu}}.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|5|In the Light, Beneath the Shadow}}</ref> Historically, they were used as a part of the family name Arisugawa-no-Miya, a branch of the Imperial Family of Japan; meanwhile, in popular culture, they are commonly used as a kanji transcription of the English name Alice. However, there has not any other connection made between Eris (Arisu/Alice) and the adventurer Alice.
** Eris is probably named after {{w|Eris (mythology)|the goddess of the same name}} in the Greek mythology (meaning "Strife"), known for having tossed the {{w|Apple of Discord|Golden Apple of Discord}} into the feast of gods, which eventually caused the Trojan War. During ''Midsummer Island Adventure'', Alice dubs the Haar Islands the "Golden Apple Archipelago," which is how the archipelago is known by in-game.
