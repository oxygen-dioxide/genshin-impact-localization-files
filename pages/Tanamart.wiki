:'''Tanamart:''' How can I save enough money to buy a custom-made axe with floral carvings from the blacksmith's shop...
:{{DIcon}} What do you need that for?
::'''Tanamart:''' To use as a weapon, of course.
::'''Tanamart:''' I might just be a homemaker right now, but I used to be a mercenary with [[the Eremites]], so I always feel uneasy without a weapon at home.
::'''Tanamart:''' Peace is precious, but you must always be prepared for the worst.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I can relate to that.
:::'''Tanamart:''' *sigh* If only my useless husband could think like you...
:::'''Tanamart:''' The more money he makes, the more bows and arrows I can buy to keep my house safe. After all, the storage and maintenance of weapons are very important.
::;(Obtain [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Tanamart:''' See you. Whether you're out or at home, make sure you stay safe.
