==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Holderlin:''' This wine really is better than tea at warming the gut and circulating the blood.
:'''Moli:''' Wine, better than tea? Ha, I think you must have had too much to drink.
:'''Holderlin:''' You just don't understand. Just a small cup of wine, and &mdash; ah! &mdash; it's like you've gone to heaven...
:'''Holderlin:''' ...on the other hand, we have your Liyue tea. It's so bitter that it's hardly fit for human lips.
:'''Moli:''' Heaven? Perhaps you're hallucinating. Why not try a trip to the [[Bubu Pharmacy]]?
:'''Moli:''' The beauty of tea lies in the taste of sweetness that hides itself in the bitterness. Just like life, which has its ups and downs...
:'''Holderlin:''' Oh, so a little drink of tea brings out the philosopher in you, eh?
:'''Moli:''' And what of it? Tea is healthier than wine, after all.
:'''Holderlin:''' Look at how yellow your teeth are from drinking tea all day. I don't see where the health comes from!
:'''Moli:''' Why, you&mdash;

==Trivia==
* Holderlin is a reference to German Romanticist philosopher {{w|Friedrich Hölderlin}}. During a Lantern Rite Event Quest he sits together with [[Caspar]], who is in turn a reference to German Romanticist painter {{w|Caspar David Friedrich}}.
* On the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]], Holderin leaves an anonymous reply to the inn's (probably [[Landa]]'s) post about wines from the "Morn Winery".
