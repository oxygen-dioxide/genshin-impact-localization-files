:'''Devitt:''' Would you like to play some "Flying Hats"? You're more than welcome to!
:{{DIcon|Flying Hatter's Trick}} I'll give it a try!
::'''Devitt:''' Alrighty-righty then. This way, please.
:{{DIcon}} About the "Flying Hatter"...
::'''Devitt:''' Interested in this tale, are you? Hahaha. I'll go over it with you &mdash; it's not too long a tale.
::'''Devitt:''' Hmm... So our tale begins with a masterful hatter.
::'''Devitt:''' This maker of hats made the very best ones in the world, and each day, there would be a stupendous crowd outside his door. Still, he would make each hat properly and beautifully.
::'''Devitt:''' Some said that he had even once been commissioned by a goddess to make ten beautiful hats of different styles.
::'''Devitt:''' To thank him for his craftsmanship, she offered him to grant him a wish. But the hatmaker said that he did not have any unfulfilled wishes.
::'''Devitt:''' He loved what he did, making hats, and everyone loved the hats he made &mdash; and that was enough for him.
::'''Devitt:''' The goddess acknowledged his noble answer, but also stated that her promise would remain valid.
::'''Devitt:''' Should he ever be willing to make a wish, she would be ready to grant it immediately.
::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
:::'''Devitt:''' But before the hatter had thought of something he truly wanted fulfilled, soldiers in the employ of a noble suddenly came knocking at his door.
:::'''Devitt:''' "Our Lord orders you to make him the best hat," a soldier said in an overbearing tone.
:::'''Devitt:''' "Sure. I'll have it delivered to him once it is done. But before that, I have to..."
:::'''Devitt:''' "No! From now on, you shall only make hats for our lord!" The soldier cut him off. The cold light glinted off their blades and spears, and he had no choice but to leave with them.
:::'''Devitt:''' At the palace, the noble welcomed him warmly, even throwing him a grand banquet.
:::'''Devitt:''' "Come then, make me the best hat! Should not the most powerful of people have the loveliest of hats? Hahaha!" The nobleman laughed loudly, but the hatmaker could not bring himself to eat a single bite.
:::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
::::'''Devitt:''' He knew then that he could never again leave that palace. He had heard of this noble's deeds &mdash; he was stingy, and loved to plunder. Seizing and hoarding consumed his every waking thought.
::::'''Devitt:''' But he was no heroic thief or great mage &mdash; he was simply a hatter, and hats could not help him deceive the guards nor vault the towering walls.
::::'''Devitt:''' And at that moment, the aggrieved hatter remembered the goddess's promise, and realized that it might be his lifeline. And so he pushed the window open and prayed in silence&mdash;
::::'''Devitt:''' "Dear Goddess, please help me escape from this cage. There are still so many out there waiting for me to make nice hats for them."
::::'''Devitt:''' "I want to be free to make hats for everyone &mdash; that's my wish."
::::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
:::::'''Devitt:''' In the instant after he finished his wish, the hat in his hands leaped into the air, suddenly fastening itself to his head.
:::::'''Devitt:''' His whole body floated up with that hat and was carried out the window, soaring high over the stunned guards, and over the heavily guarded walls.
:::::'''Devitt:''' A rain of arrows pursued him, but they were turned aside gently by the wind. The flabbergasted guards could only watch as the hatmaker flew away from the manse.
:::::'''Devitt:''' After that, none would again see that hatmaker in the city. His hat shop was demolished by the frustrated aristocrat.
:::::'''Devitt:''' But the hatmaker's good neighbors knew that he was still working to make hats for the people.
:::::'''Devitt:''' If one wanted to order a hat from him, you had to do so after midnight, writing your request on the bark of a tree using jam, before placing the bark and the payment for the hat on the highest chimney.
:::::'''Devitt:''' Within a week, a beautiful hat bearing the scent of green grass would appear on your windowsill.
:::::'''Devitt:''' And that was how everyone came to call him the "Flying Hatter."
::::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening for now...)
:::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
:{{DIcon}} I'm busy right now...
::'''Devitt:''' Oh, it's quite alright. Just come find me whenever you've got the time. I'll be staying here for time being.
