Hah, then let one dispel any doubt &mdash; one is in all things unconstrained and unabashed, free to live as one pleases, go where one desires, and journey with whomsoever one wishes. Nevertheless, ahem... In light of one's considerable renown... please call me "Xianyun" in public.

It is only natural for disciples to follow in their master's footsteps. So focused are they on their individual endeavors that they are quite content to go weeks without writing... Lonely?

Heh, when have you ever met such a considerate companion as oneself, hmm? ... ...Already intimately acquainted with said terrain, you say? Hmph... Well, be that as it may, human memory is notoriously error-prone. One of these days, you'll get yourself hopelessly lost, and then you shall be thanking one profusely for one's foresight.

|vo_06_02_tx         = Despite one's lack of interest in worldly attachments, one is quite conscious indeed of the importance of "bonds." Such a simple word for a thing so profound that it all but defies articulation... Take oneself and those old fossils, for example. Ah, sometimes we go years without meeting, and even then we find no shortage of things to quarrel about at our next reunion. Yet so deep runs our bond that no matter the physical distance between us, one will never feel alone and adrift in this world... One holds you in high esteem, child, and is pleased to count you as a friend. Do you also treasure the bond we share?

|vo_07_02_tx         = That mechanical bird of mine is only a prototype. One had aspirations for a much larger model, hollow inside so that it could unfurl into a vehicle with which to embark on sight-seeing journeys with one's old friends... The challenges of powering and operating such a device, however, proved somewhat insurmountable. After all, it required pitch control, the ability to change form, not to mention the safety features... *sigh* If only [[Guizhong]] were still here. She, no doubt, would offer many baffling but ingenious solutions to this conundrum.
|vo_07_02_mention    = Guizhong

|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = [[Mt. Aocang]] is an ideal place for spiritual cultivation. It possesses natural beauty beyond compare, and the pure, unalloyed essence of nature flows strong all around. Once upon a time, many curious birds and beasts would gather and watch as one meditated, and very soon the peace and tranquility would be replaced by a chaotic chorus of chirping and screeching... and yet, one never found it offended the ear.

|vo_08_01_tx         = One once asked Ganyu what she typically works on during her overtime hours. Her response was filled with hideous-sounding words, such as "meeting minutes," "summaries," "annual reports," "financial projections"... Hmph, were she not of [[qilin]] blood, and had one not taught to her the secrets of cultivating health, this avalanche of bureaucratic writ would have surely overwhelmed her... When you see her next, would you check that she's been drinking her [[Qingxin]] Infusion of Clear Sight on a daily basis?

|vo_08_02_tx         = Shenhe told me that once, when she was delivering an order for [[Wanmin Restaurant]], she ran across the rooftops to save time. Her customer was terrified when she jumped down onto their doorstep, and was about to call for the [[Millelith]]... Fortunately, Shenhe disappeared as quickly as she arrived, leaving the food delivery behind and making haste before the customer had time to react. It seems she is growing more proficient at handling crises all the time &mdash; one could not be more pleased.

Natural lighting, ventilation, bespoke woodwork, procuring porcelain, placement of plants and flowers... One's mind felt ready to explode from the deluge of information. Do all facets of life in the human world take so much effort?

|vo_08_04_tx         = The Conqueror of Demons is even more withdrawn than oneself &mdash; he has been sighted a mere handful of times at social gatherings over the centuries... One was interested to learn that you are on rather good terms with him &mdash; what sort of conversations do the two of you tend to have? Oh, and do let me know when you next plan to see him. Perhaps one could make some [[tofu]] pudding for you to pass on to him.

|vo_08_05_tx         = That young lady says the most bizarre-sounding things, yet she appears to be rather highly regarded by the staff of the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]] &mdash; even Rex Lapis himself saw fit to serve under her in some sort of "consultancy" capacity... Allegedly, she is similarly peculiar when it comes to her taste in food. One must admit, one finds eccentrics like her rather intriguing.

|vo_08_06_tx         = One happened to mention the Supreme Cuisine Machine in conversation with Xiangling once, but one was rather taken aback when she responded by saying that a dish is inauthentic unless it is prepared by hand... Hmph, are one's devices not also the work of one's hands? Inauthentic indeed... A contest is in order! ...Although, her mastery of [[Liyue]] cuisine is indeed impressive... Yes &mdash; the contest shall have to wait until one has made a few improvements to the device...

|vo_08_09_tx         = There are many Liyue operas adapted from stories about the adepti, including some based on one's own life and exploits... One has never watched those, of course &mdash; what could be more embarrassing than watching someone else play oneself on the stage? One would, however, be interested to evaluate how well Yun Jin did in her adaptation of Shenhe's story, when one has time to go and see it.

|vo_08_11_tx         = One is very fond of Gaming. He is good-hearted and entertaining in conversation, but never grandiloquent. We first met when one was resting by a lake, and he very kindly shared some of his provisions with me. Later, he commented that one seemed to be a wise elder, worthier of respect than even the adepti themselves... Hehe, this wise elder will be sure to look out for him after that.

One is more interested to hear about your travels to the far-flung corners of the world... What forms do the gods and immortals of other nations take? Are there any of them as amenable to conversation as oneself? Let us brew some tea, and then you can tell me all about it.

|vo_09_02_tx         = There was a time when many mortals longed to seek the guidance of the adepti. One knows not how they discovered the location of one's abode, but every other day or so, one would find people leaving offerings of food at the altar on Mt. Aocang... Hmph, why ever would mortals expect an adeptus to interrupt their meditation for the sake of ingesting a mortal meal? Most bemusing. Nevertheless, since their actions were heartfelt, one saw only fit to indulge in&mdash; Ahem, to embrace their offerings once they had departed.

One refused to grant them an audience, but they simply would not leave, and before long, Mt. Aocang had become something of a pilgrims' campsite... One promptly posted a sign outside the abode, decreeing that all would-be disciples must first present ninety-nine dishes over a period of as many days, each dish unique in its recipe and featuring the Qingxin as the main ingredient... Naturally, the crowd soon dispersed. Hmph, to master the adepti arts and the mechanical arts requires supreme talent and the utmost stillness of mind. Training would be a futile endeavor for those who cannot even persevere for a mere three months.

There was one year when it snowed heavily in Liyue, and Mt. Aocang was covered in several feet of snow. Seeing everyone cooped up in their abodes with nothing to do, one created a [[Snowdrift Mechanism]] for skiing on the mountains. One was having a tremendous time of it along with Guizhong and [[Streetward Rambler]]... until, of course, [[Moon Carver]] noticed as much and decided to join in. Moments later, he had managed to send the mechanism flying off the rails and plummeted deep into a snow bank. It took us hours to dig him out... Later, one introduced a great many safety features to the mechanism, to the point where it could be safely piloted by even a three-year-old child. Although this did entail a compromise on the top speed of the vehicle.

|vo_09_05_tx         = One has read a great many works of popular literature since moving to Liyue Harbor. Those of the chivalric martial arts genre have proven the most entertaining, although the heroes within their pages are all works of the imagination. Would it not be even more compelling to tell the stories of the many such real-life figures with whom one is acquainted? It is a pity that one's disciples are so averse to one sharing the tales of their lives with other people... Perhaps you could relay more of the tales from your travels? One could adapt those into a novel instead.
