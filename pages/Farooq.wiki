==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farooq:''' Watch out for pickpockets.
:{{DIcon}} Are there lots of thieves?
::'''Farooq:''' With the [[Corps of Thirty]] around, pickpockets wouldn't dare come around often.
::'''Farooq:''' But there could be "inside jobs."
::'''Farooq:''' If you see someone who looks exactly like me, watch your wallet.
::'''Farooq:''' He's my twin brother. A petty thief who talks nonsense all the time.
::'''Farooq:''' Don't let him rub off on you. Just keep an eye on his actions.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You all look pretty much the same...
:::'''Farooq:''' That's even easier: Don't trust anyone.
:::'''Farooq:''' You'll pay the price someday if you let your guard down around people in uniforms.
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the reminder.
::'''Farooq:''' Good to hear that.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* According to both his and Akram dialogues, it seems that they are twin brothers and Farooq is the younger one.
