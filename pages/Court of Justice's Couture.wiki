|description    = A metal-glass composite building with distinctly [[Fontaine|Fontainian]] characteristics. Other than a few decorative objects, no wood or stone was used in the construction, offering a refreshing aesthetic. The [[Chioriya Boutique]] selected this type of construction for its storefront, and putting the already gorgeous and magnificent clothing both inside and outside the indigo-toned shop has been proven to be particularly eye-catching. After the boutique became famous, other fashion outlets soon followed suit, but beyond the visual appeal, Chioriya's success lies in the excellent quality of its products. Just as its owner, Miss [[Chiori]], began a fashion fad in Fontaine, the popularity of this metal-glass style of architecture also soared to new heights due to its many advantages. Thereafter, the footprint of similar buildings in the Court of Fontaine's urban planning has only increased.
