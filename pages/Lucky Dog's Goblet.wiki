'''Lucky Dog's Goblet''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Lucky Dog]].

==Description==
Once there was a child favored by fortune from the day he was born.<br />Try as they might, even the most vicious bandits could not lay a finger on him. He became known as Lucky Dog.<br />The child grew up, and one day in the throes of adulthood he found himself stumbling drunk along the back alley behind the tavern.<br />Under the starless sky, a vicious bandit prepared to rob Lucky Dog, taking advantage of his compromised state.<br />But just as the bandit was about to strike, a flying goblet hit him square on the forehead, knocking him out cold.<br />Naturally, this makes Lucky Dog one of very few people known to have benefited, rather than suffered, from being in the vicinity of a tavern brawl.
