|description    = A massive forge modeled after the Forge of Refuge in the Temple of Pax. While it lacks the original's phlogiston-powered functionality, its performance still rivals the original thanks to [[Tubby]]'s adeptal power. Natlan poets often use metal smelting as a metaphor for a warrior's life &mdash; the journey from being a lump of inconspicuous rock into something that has been discovered; of crude, impure iron being turned into resilient, unyielding steel. Perhaps the comparison is apt, for just as metal may be hardened through higher temperatures and repeated hammering, so too does a warrior grow stronger the more trials and tribulations they face.
