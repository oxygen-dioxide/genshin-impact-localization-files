|description    = The standard inner door of a lofty tower, built from a slab of thick, sturdy mountain rock inlaid with a relief design in metal. Not only is it exceptionally sturdy, it also offers unparalleled soundproofing and insulation &mdash; ideal for private spaces. The graffiti on the door is made using specialized phlogiston-based paints, not only extending its lifespan but also providing anti-stain and even mood-enhancing benefits.<br>That being said, given that they are made from stone, these doors require considerable strength to operate and maintain. Slighter individuals, as well those for whom physical strength is not their forte, may want to think carefully before installing such doors...
