The '''Pari''' are a race of avian, flower-like creatures descending from the Divine Bird [[Simurgh]], who reside in the [[Vourukasha Oasis]] in [[Girdle of the Sands]], [[Sumeru]]. They are encountered in the {{Quest|Khvarena of Good and Evil}}. They consider their God to be [[Egeria]], the former Hydro Archon, who was "stained with corruption" during the [[cataclysm]] and whose consciousness lies in the [[Harvisptokhm]].<ref name=":0" />

==Overview==
Pari were created when Simurgh combined her [[Khvarena]] with the [[Amrita]].<ref name="Z">{{Ref/NPC|Zurvan}}</ref> They are the only form of Khvarena that is sentient.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref> Each Pari is said to have a fated responsibility, which they must undertake alone, and live only to serve that purpose.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Asipattravana Itihasa}}</ref> 

At the end of their life cycle, Pari turn into [[Plume of Purifying Light]], which are to be returned to the [[Amrita Pool]] in Vourukasha Oasis.<ref name="VG">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Vourukasha's Glow}}</ref> Pari that have been "tainted" by [[Abyssal Corruption]] will be rejected by the Oasis, thus they transform themselves into [[Fravashi Tree]]s. Humans they have bonded with, whom they refer to as "Yasnapati," are responsible for bringing these lost Pari home.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Pale Fire (Quest)}}</ref>

During the [[cataclysm]], the Pari fought alongside [[Khaenri'ah]]n warriors, "a [[Dainsleif|masked sword-wielder]] and a [[Nagarjuna|one-armed sage]]," and a group of scholars from [[Sumeru Akademiya]], who would later become the [[Order of Skeptics]].<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Quest|The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)}}</ref>
