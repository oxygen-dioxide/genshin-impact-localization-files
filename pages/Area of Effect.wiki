'''Area of Effect''' (AoE) is a term used to describe abilities that affect a wide spatial range. These abilities can affect multiple targets usually within a fixed radius.<ref>Wowpedia: [https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Area_of_Effect Area of Effect]</ref>

Within the game's source code, many of these AoE skills will usually have a "radius" parameter indicating its circular or spherical size (in [[meter]]s).

Many AoE effects in the game also have a vertical height. For example, in [[Version 2.1]] a height limit was added to [[Thunderwood]]'s AoE.

==Elemental Reactions==
Some [[Elemental Reactions]] have AoE effects:<ref>Interruption Resistance: [[Interruption Resistance/Data|Data]]</ref><ref>Source Data: [https://github.com/Dimbreath/GenshinData/blob/master/BinOutput/Ability/Temp/ConfigAbility_Element.json Elemental Reactions]</ref>

*[[Superconduct]] deals {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} within a 5 [[meter]] radius
*[[Swirl]] spreads elemental auras within a 6-meter radius
*[[Overloaded]] creates an AoE explosion within a 5-meter radius

==Shapes and Types==
Many AoE abilities are circular, cylindrical, or spherical in shape. Some are more conical, spreading out within a certain angle rather than a full 360 degrees.

==Size Comparison==
===Less than 5-6 meters===
Most AoE effects from character talents in the game are less than 5â€“6 meters in radius.

===Around 6-10 meters===
These include character-deployed fields like:

* Inspiration Field (Fantastic Voyage, Bennett's Burst)
* Chonghua Frost Field (Spirit Blade: Chonghua's Layered Frost, Chongyun's Skill)
* Drunken Mist (Signature Mix, Diona's Burst)
* Dandelion Field (Dandelion Breeze, Jean's Burst)

The radius for some character's bursts like Havoc: Obliteration (ranged) are also around 6 meters.

The radius for Xiao's High Plunge AoE during Bane of All Evil is also around 6 meters.

Other skills include:
* Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma AoE
* Celestial Shower AoE
* Chihayaburu (Hold) pulling AoE
* Yoohoo Art: Mujina Flurry field

===More than 10 meters===
These include:

* Wind's Grand Ode [[Vacuum Field]] pulling radius
* Forbidden Creation - Isomer 75 / Type II [[Vacuum Field]] pulling radius

Other Notes:
*The [[Plunging Attack]] AoE is usually less than 5 meters. During [[Bane of All Evil|Xiao's Elemental Burst]], his Plunging AoE is increased up to ~6 meters for high plunges.<ref name="xiao" /> See [[Plunging Attack]] for more details.
*Zhongli's stele has a height of ~4m and a resonance radius of ~8m, slightly less than the radius of Albedo's Solar Isotoma (~10m). The vertical resonance range is also around 8m, measured from the base of the stele.<ref name="zl" />

*The AoE for many other abilities such as claymore/polearm swings, catalyst charged attacks, etc. is usually within a 3m radius.
*The auto-targeting range for some bow and catalyst users (such as Diona, Yanfei or Kokomi) is 15 meters.

===Area of Effect Markers===
[[File:Large Geo Slime Leap.gif|thumb|100px|A Large Geo Slime leaping. When the inner circle touches the outer circle, DMG is dealt to the area marked with the circle.]]
AoE markers are sometimes present to indicate when an enemy will have reached a particular attack point on the ground.
* AoE circles deal DMG when the inner circle touches the border. For example, a [[Large Geo Slime]]'s leap will have dealt Geo DMG when the inner circle precisely touches the outer circle. Freezing enemies can delay, but not stop, the AoE attack at that point, but some enemies like the [[Hydro Mimic Frog]] deal AoE DMG ''before'' touching the ground. If the AoE is large enough, not even [[dash]] [[i-frames]] can negate DMG effects.
* AoE rectangles deal DMG after showing their attack course. For example, the [[Thunder Manifestation]], when it casts its "Dive Bomb" attack, will have markers indicating the direction and AoE of the attack.

==Environmental Effects==
Some [[Ley Line Disorders]] and other contraptions that appear in the environment, domains, or events have AoE effects as well.
