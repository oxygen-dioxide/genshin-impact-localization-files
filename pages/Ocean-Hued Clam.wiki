==Gameplay Notes==
* The Sea-Dyed Foam deals {{Color|[[Physical]] DMG}}. This damage is affected by enemies' [[Physical RES]], but is unaffected by [[Physical DMG Bonus]], enemy [[DEF]],<ref group="Note">Like [[Transformative Reactions]], the Sea-Dyed Foam does have a DMG multiplier based on DEF:<br><math>\text{DEF Multiplier}_\text{Sea-Dyed Foam} = \frac{99999999}{99999999 + \text{DEF}_\text{Target}}</math><br>However, the difference it causes is so extremely minuscule that it can usually be ignored.</ref> or enemy [[Damage Reduction]].
* The Sea-Dyed Foam will count healing absorbed by [[Bond of Life]].
