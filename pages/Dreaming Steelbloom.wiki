{{Description|A flower bud made of hammered dark gold. Its crimson core is wrapped by petals that shall never open.}}
'''Dreaming Steelbloom''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Gilded Dreams]].

==Description==
"In [[Aaru's Shut|the golden slumber]], no one shall have to ingest a single drop of bitter water."<br>
The ancient legends tell of three inseparable friends.<br>
[[Goddess of Flowers|One of them]] would wither like a rose and come to rot in the mud.<br>
The [[Ay-Khanoum|kingdom of flowers]] would be ground down into a mere tale by sandstorms, becoming a dream in a song.

[[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|One of the friends]] would create a great, [[Apam Woods|heretofore unseen oasis]] in a corner of the desert.<br>
[[King Deshret|Another]] would use up all their strength and intellect to build [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|an eternal illusion]] in the sands.<br>
No one should have had scars carved upon their faces due to sorrow and partings.

"When the moon leaves your palm, and the lonesome silver light retracts from atop the labyrinth on the sand ocean,"<br>
"[[King Deshret|One]] hopes that [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|you]] will remember how your companion in the dreams shone like the burning sun."

Thus does obsessive remembrance arise from the burning new world like a smokeless flame,<br>
Thus do those who look to the past with one eye, and to a world of dreams with the other become lost,<br>
Thus did he turn his gaze upon the wisdom of [[Abyss|the depths]], and inclined his ear to [[Forbidden Knowledge|honeyed whispers]]...
