|description  = A special slip of paper that can illuminate one's fortune. Also known to a certain someone as "strips of paper."<br />You can only get one of these per day, which will cause the previous day's fortune slip to lose meaning and disappear.<br />They say that slips that portend ill luck such as "Misfortune" and "Great Misfortune" can be tied to the Fortune Slip Hanger as a prayer for a turnaround.<br />Regardless, "fate" and "destiny" are things best grasped and forged in one's own hands.
