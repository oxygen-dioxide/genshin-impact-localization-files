==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Inaba Kyuuzou is a samurai for the [[Inazuma Shogunate]] who was stranded near a deserted and wrecked Sangonomiya ship in [[Nazuchi Beach]].  He has been living in the ship to tend with his wounds and drive pirates away from the area without rest.

After completing Archon Quest Chapter II, Act III: [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], Inaba's wife, [[Inaba Shizuko]], posts Missing Person Posters across Inazuma's bulletin boards in hopes of finding him. (The messages will appear regardless of whether the player completed Fate of a Fighter.)

===Personality===
Upon initially meeting Kyuuzou, he could be perceived as a proud individual who is humiliated by the fact he had to be saved by an outlander. Upon reading Inaba Kyuuzou's letter, it is well understood that he thought he could become a great, even legendary fighter. After many years of aiding in war, he realised he cannot or does not want to become the person he once aimed to be, regretting his life and choices he made. He also seems to hate himself: "What a pity that I survived yet again, huh?"
