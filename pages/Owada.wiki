==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Owada:''' When will today end... Ack, you scared me!
:'''Owada:''' Are... are you here to report something?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Owada''' I'm the [[Yoriki]] of the [[Police Station]], the superior of every [[Doushin]] here. Just call me Owada.
::'''Owada''' The Police Station is in charge of keeping order and peace. If you see anything out of order, you can come here and report it to us...
::'''Owada''' That being said, I still hope that nothing comes up. May the Electro Archon bless us all.
:{{DIcon}} Do you get a lot of reports?
::'''Owada:''' Shush! Stop saying that word. If there were indeed reports every day, do you think we could handle it?
::'''Owada:''' I'm getting too old for this. I only wish to clock out on time daily and retire peacefully...
::'''Owada:''' Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not slacking off. I have been in this line of work for far too long and have seen everything. I just want the world to be peaceful so that everyone can live happily in peace. Wouldn't that be great?
::'''Owada''' The less crime we have, the better... And if it's a case about losing your pet, please visit [[Ryuuji]] at the detective agency for help.
::{{DIcon}} Ryuuji?
::'''Owada''' Ryuuji is from the [[Bantan Sango Detective Agency]], and he's an old acquaintance of mine.
::'''Owada''' Back when he was the victim of a frame job, I wanted to do something, but sadly, my power was limited...
::'''Owada''' Luckily, he met the president of that detective agency, who helped to clear his name.
::'''Owada''' Anyway, it's best that we don't see another case like that one... or any cases at all. Yeah.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Owada:''' Goodbye. Stay safe.
