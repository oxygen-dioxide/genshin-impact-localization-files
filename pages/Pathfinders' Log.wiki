The '''Pathfinders' Logs''' are a set of interactable notes found in the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]], [[Sumeru]].

The logs relate to a past expedition by the Eremites, which included [[Jebrael]] and [[Samail]] as members. Interacting with Note 6 gives a final upgrade to the [[Scarlet Sand Slate]], and interacting with all 6 grants the achievement [[Genesis of the Rift]].

==Dialogue==
===Pathfinders' Log: I===
You who come after us:<br />
If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its first strain in memory of the lost.<br />
For Umur, who lost his way.<br />
"Before the searing sands melted your bones, the flaming golden light scorched your ambitions. It covered all our eyes, and it will cover you, perhaps even before it shall see you erased."<br />
Before we set out, I stated that this was a journey accursed, but no one would listen.<br />
I know who it is I must believe. The nourisher of my spirit, the servant of the [[Goddess of Flowers]] — she knows that which is true.<br />
Now, we have lost Umur. As we approached the ruins of [[Gurabad]], he was separated from us by a cyclone. His body was buried beneath the rolling sands, and his spirit now swirls in the wind for ever. He shall never know peace.<br />
Perhaps we should advance no further.<br />
<br />
Tarafa

===Pathfinders' Log: II===
You who come after us in prayer:<br />
If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its second strain in memory of the wounded and the dead.<br />
For Bahaddin, who shall not see again.<br />
"It was a familiar pain, white scales falling from under one's brow. And then, all that came from that vast orbital cavity was a suffocating shuddering silence."<br />
I must record what I have seen here.<br />
One of our hunters, Bahaddin, was taken in the claws of a Red Vulture before our very eyes.<br />
When we saw him again, his other eye socket was empty as well.<br />
Several years ago, he lost an eye hunting [[Red Vulture|Red Vultures]], but he brought back the fiercest quarry we had ever seen. Now, a scant few years on, the shriveled face of the man hunted by the vulture was twisted as it faced us, and his eye, once like unto a hawk, was now akin to the void.<br />
<br />
Tarafa

===Pathfinders' Log: III===
You who come after us:<br />
If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its third strain in memory of the poisoned.<br />
For Rabeed, who shall not wake again.<br />
"Woe unto those spiked tails, those sand dunes that nurture malice. They drag across your throat in your mournful sleep, and thus shall you never again walk under the sun."<br />
Rabeed was set upon in his sleep by a scorpion.<br />
It was an agonizing torture beyond words. The venom caused his breathing to weaken, to which the scratching about his throat was testament.<br />
I said this was a cursed journey and that we should return.<br />
But even the deaths of several comrades cannot stop these people. They have been ensnared by this keystone. It has sucked the light from their path, so they cannot see.<br />
You who come after us — if you have read till here, turn back, I bid you, and swiftly!<br />
<br />
Tarafa

===Pathfinders' Log: IV===
You who come after us:<br />
If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its fourth strain in memory of the misfortunate.<br />
For Jebrael, who lost his footing.<br />
"How could one conceive the passing of a cloud, or the death of the blowing wind? How might one mark a grain of sand falling into the desert, or a droplet disappearing into the water?"<br />
I believed Jebrael would be the last. He should have been the last.<br />
But who can say? Perhaps the many mishaps broke him, unexpectedly.<br />
Jebrael, so agile and swift! To think that he would fall off the side of the ruins in the gorge.<br />
Unexpected indeed.<br />
Now, I and Samail are the only ones left. Yes, we are the last of this little exploration team.<br />
This journey is cursed! But no matter. Soon, it shall reach its end.<br />
Yes. Soon.<br />
<br />
Tarafa

===Pathfinders' Log: V===
You who come after us:<br />
She tricked me! The keystone is real! No wonder Jebrael and Samail believed it so strongly... That great engineer really did leave traces here, just as we read from those ancient glyphs!<br />
I thought they were lies meant to obscure history... But now, the place they described is here before our eyes.<br />
This is the third place of worship. Gurabad's secret treasure must be hidden here.<br />
But this keystone is not sufficient. There must be something else...<br />
There must be some other method to open the great gate of Gurabad.<br />
As long as we can find our way inside, we can obtain the treasure. Then this expedition would not have been in vain.<br />
But then... I... What was I even doing...<br />
<br />
Tarafa

===Pathfinders' Log: VI===
If Tarafa were writing this, I suppose he might say this...<br />
You who come after us:<br />
We are the descendants of Al-Ahmar. We are those who are fated to follow in the footsteps of the king of the crimson sands.<br />
But the prosperous past is too far gone, and there are many now whose faith wavers, just like Tarafa.<br />
He betrayed us, and took us for fools all the while.<br />
Umur, Bahaddin, and Rabeed... All dead, due to his meddling.<br />
My own death I faked a few days prior to avoid his scrutiny, and I then struck first before he could attack Samail.<br />
This stone slate... It was the [[Babel|matriarch of Tanit]]'s ploy all along.<br />
It is likely, then, that there is no treasure to be found within Gurabad's corpse after all.<br />
We were decieved.<br />
Perhaps our journey really was accursed, just as Tarafa claimed.<br />
And our curse was Tarafa... and the mother he trusted in.<br />
Samail says that this keystone might be real, but I doubt it. Whatever the case may be, it is now worthless to us.<br />
So let it lie here... and you who come after, hear me now: May you escape being deceived by those you trust.<br />
<br />
Jebrael

===Dialogue after note 6===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Someone left notes here... Wait, Jebrael left these notes!
:'''Paimon:''' Jebrael, that name sounds so familiar. Hey, isn't that...
:{{DIcon}} It's Jeht's father...
:{{DIcon}} Samail's been mentioned as well...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like Jebrael and Samail were still friendly at that time. They were from the same tribe, after all... Maybe they came here together.
:'''Paimon:''' Hm... Is this stone they left on the side of the road actually the keystone from the records...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's really not sure how this thing might work... Hey, (Traveler), do you have any idea what it can do?
:{{DIcon}} It's the stone slate.
:'''Paimon:''' The symbol on the slate is lighting up!

:'''Right after activating the symbol on the slate, the keystone turns into sand and disappears.'''

:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, the keystone suddenly turned into sand! Paimon didn't see that coming.
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like the keystone and the slate are related... Paimon never thought we'd find new clues about the slate here. We should go tell Tirzad when we have time!
