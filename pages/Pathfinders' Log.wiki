The '''Pathfinders' Logs''' are a set of interactable notes found in the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]], [[Sumeru]].

The logs relate to a past expedition by the Eremites, which included [[Jebrael]] and [[Samail]] as members. Interacting with Note 6 gives a final upgrade to the [[Scarlet Sand Slate]], and interacting with all 6 grants the achievement [[Genesis of the Rift]].

-->You who come after us:<br><!--
-->If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its first strain in memory of the lost.<br><!--
-->For Umur, who lost his way.<br><!--
-->"Before the searing sands melted your bones, the flaming golden light scorched your ambitions. It covered all our eyes, and it will cover you, perhaps even before it shall see you erased."<br><!--
-->Before we set out, I stated that this was a journey accursed, but no one would listen.<br><!--
-->I know who it is I must believe. The nourisher of my spirit, the servant of the [[Goddess of Flowers]] &mdash; she knows that which is true.<br><!--
-->Now, we have lost Umur. As we approached the ruins of [[Gurabad]], he was separated from us by a cyclone. His body was buried beneath the rolling sands, and his spirit now swirls in the wind for ever. He shall never know peace.<br><!--
-->Perhaps we should advance no further.<br><!--

-->"It was a familiar pain, white scales falling from under one's brow. And then, all that came from that vast orbital cavity was a suffocating shuddering silence."<br><!--
-->I must record what I have seen here.<br><!--
-->One of our hunters, Bahaddin, was taken in the claws of a Red Vulture before our very eyes.<br><!--
-->When we saw him again, his other eye socket was empty as well.<br><!--
-->Several years ago, he lost an eye hunting [[Red Vulture]]s, but he brought back the fiercest quarry we had ever seen. Now, a scant few years on, the shriveled face of the man hunted by the vulture was twisted as it faced us, and his eye, once like unto a hawk, was now akin to the void.<br><!--

-->Rabeed was set upon in his sleep by a scorpion.<br><!--
-->It was an agonizing torture beyond words. The venom caused his breathing to weaken, to which the scratching about his throat was testament.<br><!--
-->I said this was a cursed journey and that we should return.<br><!--
-->But even the deaths of several comrades cannot stop these people. They have been ensnared by this keystone. It has sucked the light from their path, so they cannot see.<br><!--

-->I believed Jebrael would be the last. He should have been the last.<br><!--
-->But who can say? Perhaps the many mishaps broke him, unexpectedly.<br><!--
-->Jebrael, so agile and swift! To think that he would fall off the side of the ruins in the gorge.<br><!--

-->She tricked me! The keystone is real! No wonder Jebrael and Samail believed it so strongly... That great engineer really did leave traces here, just as we read from those ancient glyphs!<br><!--

-->This is the third place of worship. Gurabad's secret treasure must be hidden here.<br><!--

-->If Tarafa were writing this, I suppose he might say this...<br><!--
-->You who come after us:<br><!--
-->We are the descendants of [[King Deshret|Al-Ahmar]]. We are those who are fated to follow in the footsteps of the king of the crimson sands.<br><!--
-->But the prosperous past is too far gone, and there are many now whose faith wavers, just like Tarafa.<br><!--
-->He betrayed us, and took us for fools all the while.<br><!--
-->Umur, Bahaddin, and Rabeed... All dead, due to his meddling.<br><!--
-->My own death I faked a few days prior to avoid his scrutiny, and I then struck first before he could attack Samail.<br><!--
-->This stone slate... It was [[Babel|her]] ploy all along.<br><!--
-->It is likely, then, that there is no treasure to be found within Gurabad's corpse after all.<br><!--
-->We were decieved.<br><!--
-->Perhaps our journey really was accursed, just as Tarafa claimed.<br><!--
-->And our curse was Tarafa... and the mother he trusted in.<br><!--

:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Someone left notes here... Wait, Jebrael left these notes!
:'''Paimon:''' Jebrael, that name sounds so familiar. Hey, isn't that...
:{{DIcon}} It's [[Jeht]]'s father...
:{{DIcon}} Samail's been mentioned as well...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like Jebrael and Samail were still friendly at that time. They were from the same tribe, after all... Maybe they came here together.
:'''Paimon:''' Hm... Is this stone they left on the side of the road actually the keystone from the records...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's really not sure how this thing might work... Hey, {{Traveler}}, do you have any idea what it can do?
:{{DIcon}} It's the stone slate.
:'''Paimon:''' The symbol on the slate is lighting up!
:{{Black Screen|Right after activating the symbol on the slate, the keystone turns into sand and disappears.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, the keystone suddenly turned into sand! Paimon didn't see that coming.
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like the keystone and the slate are related... Paimon never thought we'd find new clues about the slate here. We should go tell Tirzad when we have time!
