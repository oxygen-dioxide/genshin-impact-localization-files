{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Qiuyue:''' Dear guest, would you like to purchase some minerals from Liyue?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Let's see what you've got... <small>''(Only available after completing [[Chisato's Letter]])''</small>
::'''Qiuyue:''' Come on in then, and take a look. These are all the finest!
:;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Qiuyue/Blade of the Lone Wolf|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Qiuyue:''' How about that? I'm unbeatable at Genius Invokation TCG!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Qiuyue:''' ...How could I let you get away with that... I need to think about it...
:{{DIcon|!}} Do you have any information about Inazuman ores? <small>''(Unknown trigger condition)''</small>
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Qiuyue knows; Version 1)
:::'''Qiuyue:''' Hmm, come to think of it, I've heard that some people saw some ore resembling purplish crystals nearby.
:::'''Qiuyue:''' That said, I'm just a businessperson, and I'm not in the mining business either. And it's not like I can leave my store so easily, anyway...
:::'''Qiuyue:''' I'd say that they saw it around... here. There, it should be marked on your map now. If you think it'll be of any use to you, feel free to take a look.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Qiuyue knows; Version 2)
:::'''Qiuyue:''' Hmm, now that you mention it, I've heard that someone found some ores nearby that are of better quality than usual.
:::'''Qiuyue:''' That said, I'm just a businessperson, and I'm not in the mining business either. And it's not like I can leave my store so easily, anyway...
:::'''Qiuyue:''' I'd say that they saw it around... here. There, it should be marked on your map now. If you think it'll be of any use to you, feel free to take a look.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Qiuyue knows)
:::'''Qiuyue:''' Well... I'd say that things are the same as always. The flow of goods from Liyue is as bottle-necked as ever. No special change on that front.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby? <small>''(Unknown trigger condition)''</small>
:;(Same as before, Ore Vein condition)
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby? <small>''(Unknown trigger condition)''</small>
::'''Qiuyue:''' Hmm. It does seem like more and more people have decided to come to Ritou to set up shop.
::'''Qiuyue:''' There'll be more competition, but more customers as well, so I suppose it's a net gain.
:{{DIcon}} About this shop...
::'''Qiuyue:''' This shop is the Inazuma franchise of the Chuyu Trading Company. We mainly sell minerals, jewelry, and jade artifacts.
::'''Qiuyue:''' We offer the finest materials from Liyue. Each piece is a gift from [[Rex Lapis]].
::'''Qiuyue:''' Although we don't boast the same reputation as those classic brands like [[The Jade Mystery]] or [[Mingxing Jewelry]], the quality of our products is definitely on par with theirs!
::{{DIcon}} How's business been?
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Qiuyue:''' We're doing okay. After all, there is always demand for minerals no matter where you go.
:::'''Qiuyue:''' ...If there is demand, there is a market, and Liyue merchants will never miss a business opportunity!
:::'''Qiuyue:''' The only problem here is the [[Sakoku Decree]]. Our import channels were still affected by it in the end... Ah, it's such a headache.
:;(After completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Qiuyue:''' It's been great, recently. I mean, ore is always in demand, you know? And where there's demand, there's a market, and we Liyue merchants will never miss a business opportunity!
:::'''Qiuyue:''' The other thing is the opening of the trade roads, which has resulted in increased channels and buyers alike.
:::'''Qiuyue:''' Once I scrounge up some more capital, I'm opening up a branch in Inazuma City!
:::'''Qiuyue:''' Gotta take advantage of the situation before someone sets themselves up as my competitor here, you know?
::{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis...
:::'''Qiuyue:''' Do you mean the passing of Rex Lapis? I've already heard about that.
:::'''Qiuyue:''' When that incident took place, the lockdown of Inazuma had already happened, so I also missed the Rite of Parting.
:::'''Qiuyue:''' *sigh* I'm still broken up about it. I'm sure every Liyue citizen would've grieved too.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} I've seen the Rite of Parting...
::::'''Qiuyue:''' Wow! So you are the rumored foreign Traveler that assisted with the Rite of Parting!
::::'''Qiuyue:''' I apologize for my rudeness. As one of the Rex Lapis' subjects, I need to properly show you my gratitude.
::::'''Qiuyue:''' Please accept my humble gift. Make sure you take it.
:::;(Obtain Prithiva Topaz Fragment ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Qiuyue:''' Take care! Come back anytime!

:'''Qiuyue:''' Ah, sorry for the wait, dear customer. Would you like some ores from Liyue?
