The '''Flower-Feather Clan''', or '''Tlalocan''', is one of the six tribes in [[Natlan]]. They can be found at the [["Flower-Feather Clan"]] perched atop [[Quahuacan Cliff]]. Their current chief is [[Mutota]].

==Overview==
Members of this tribe bond well to the [[Qucusaurus]], and many able-bodied tribespeople join the [[Qucusaur Riders]], as an active or reserve member. Regardless of position, they must pass a very tough entrance exam, which involves being a proficient warrior and being able to ride a qucusaur, requiring the applicant to be able to gain their trust. The most common cause of failure is being unable to obtain the qucusaur's trust, as it is said that without full control, both the rider and qucusaur would be seriously harmed or killed. Those who are unable to pass it are called "Wingless," and must reject their Saurian companion for their own safety.<ref name="Wingless">{{Ref/Quest|The Wingless One of Tlalocan}}</ref> It is difficult to live in the tribe as a "Wingless," and many will make repeated attempts to pass the Rider Exams or leave to seek employment with other tribes.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tirda}}</ref> Some, like [[Allpa]], eventually succeed in passing the exams.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Of Fading Flowers and Falling Feathers}}</ref> Others, such as [[Pixica]], stay because they manage to find other meaningful work within the tribe.<ref name="Wingless"/>

At some point in the past, the Flower-Feather Clan was responsible for patrolling and defending all of Natlan. Many Qucusaur riders still feel a sense of pride about this to this day.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Chasca|About Chasca: Self-Confidence}}</ref> Nowadays, the riders prioritize their own territory, but they also patrol the ruins of [[Ochkanatlan]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kannek}}</ref> Sometime after the fall of Ochkanatlan, they instated a blockade to prevent any travelers from entering it (presumably for their own safety).<ref>Interactable: [[Furnace of Fiery Embers#Nameless Traveler's Notes (IV)|Nameless Traveler's Notes (IV)]]</ref>

Most people from other tribes will usually not talk to lone members of the clan. If said member begins whistling, it is implied that something is off in the vicinity.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Yagbeu}}</ref>

==Lore==
The Flower-Feather clan was founded thousands of years ago by [[Lianca]], an abandoned orphan who was taken in by the Eighth [[Thirteen Sovereign Lords|Dragonlord]] of [[Natlantea]], Ix Ajkotz'i'q Iq'ismal Waxak Lahun Chu'ule-L. After going on her own path, she realized her true path. With a few other orphans who had nowhere to go, the tribe began to attract more people; first, warriors from other tribes who were unwilling to be bound by their former tribe's rules, and then dragons who had been banished and sought her protection. Lianca took all in regardless if they were friend or foe.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Chain Breaker}}</ref>

During the Abyss invasion of Natlan, the Flower-Feather Clan took the largest amount of damage, but eventually recovered when the invasion was repulsed. 

Shortly after the invasion, Allpa attempted to stage a coup by overthrowing the current chief, [[Mutota]] by gathering the Wingless' support by appealing to their desire to soar the skies via Phlogiston-powered jet packs &mdash; these packs were powered through Phlogiston produced by the Qucusaurs' glands. However, Allpa's cronies had failed to capture Mutota (who had been coaching two other members), and several Wingless opposed her idea, and Allpa herself was defeated by the Traveler and Chasca.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Time for the Showdown}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*The name "Flower-Feather Clan" is likely derived from the name of the [[Thirteen Sovereign Lords|Dragonlord]] titled "Priestess of Floral Candles and Skyborne Feathers," who was the mother of [[Lianca]], the tribe's founder.
* Flower-Feather Clan members are known to fly Qucusaurs, but they are also fond of riding [[Gaseous Phlogiston|Phlogiston Currents]] without any gear (as shown by [[Kallfu]] and [[Bona]]).
===Etymology===
*Like the other known tribes, Tlalocan is likely derived from Ilhuicatl-Tlalocan, one of the {{w|Aztec religion|Aztec}} {{w|Thirteen Heavens}}, named after the Aztec god of rain and thunder, {{w|Tlaloc}}. 
**Ilhuicatl-Tlalocan is another name for Ilhuicatl-Meztli which is the namesake of the [[People of the Springs]].
**The name Flower-Feather Clan could allude to the Aztec goddess ''{{w|Xōchiquetzal|Xochiquetzal}}'' (Nahuatl: ''{{wt|xochitl|Xochitl}}'' "Flower"; ''{{wt|quetzalli|Quetzalli}}'' "Quetzal Feather") meaning "flower precious feather."
