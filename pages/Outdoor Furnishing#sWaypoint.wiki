'''Waypoint''' is a [[Furnishing Subcategory]] in the category [[Outdoor Furnishing]].

Players can teleport to a Waypoint even from outside the Serenitea Pot, making them an alternative to placing down their Serenitea Pot from their inventory and interacting with it to enter the teapot. Once used, the empty gap in the hitbox is where the character will teleport to.

In addition to the deployable furnishing, there is also a [[Serenitea Pot#Realm Waypoint: A Place to Return To|special waypoint]] included in the first area of each realm that cannot be moved or removed.
