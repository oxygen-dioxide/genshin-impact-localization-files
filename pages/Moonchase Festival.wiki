The {{Lang|'''Moonchase Festival'''|zh=逐月节|zh_rm=Zhúyuè-jié}} is a festival in [[Liyue]].

==History==
In ancient times, the people of Liyue paid tribute to the Stove God, [[Marchosius]]; who taught the inhabitants of the [[Guili Assembly]] to create fire, and in turn, how to cook food. It is believed that this seasonal practice, which [[Keqing]]'s grandfather termed the "Stove God Festival", was a precursor to the Moonchase Festival.<ref name="mm1" />

The Moonchase Festival celebrates the arrival of fall by moonlight, which is said to be the time of year when the [[adepti]] would seek "the Way" thousands of years ago. "Moonchase" was originally a rite only observed by the adepti, yet it gave rise to various festivals created by the ordinary folk who sought to emulate it.

These festivals; including the Stove God Festival; would later be unified by [[Rex Lapis]] under the Moonchase name to honor and commemorate Marchosius,<ref name="mm1" /> who sacrificed all of his divine power to protect [[Liyue Harbor]] from disaster and plagues.<ref name="mm2">{{Ref/Quest|Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go}}</ref>

In modern times, the Moonchase Festival is seen as a time for the people of Liyue to reunite with friends and family, have feasts and enjoy themselves.

Each year, the [[Liyue Qixing]] decides on a theme for Moonchase; the most recent being "Feast of the Bounteous Land", which coincided with that year's Masterful Chefs competition.<ref name="mm1" />
