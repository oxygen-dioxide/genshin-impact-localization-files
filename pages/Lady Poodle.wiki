|description = Humanity's best friend!<br>These Fontainian pet dogs have had their fur meticulously groomed and are adorned with custom-made apparel. This type of dog bears the disposition of a lady. Young women who are interested in owning pets have a tendency to take a special interest in this breed, often bringing them to tea parties. Rumor has it that someone has bought special-made clothes for this breed in bulk from the [[Chioriya Boutique]]. As such, certain keen merchants have already taken these developments into account to develop future related businesses...
