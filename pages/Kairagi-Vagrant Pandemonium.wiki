'''Kairagi-Vagrant Pandemonium''' is a weekly [[Reputation Request]] that occurs in [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|Kairagi and Vagrants are creating chaos somewhere on [[Yashiori Island]]. [[Kujou Masahito]] hopes that someone can help put an end to the issue.}}
#Defeat the Kairagi and Vagrant

==Request Details==
Help Needed:<br />
I received a report that there was trouble brewing on [[Yashiori Island]], and I initially thought it might be rebels on the move again.<br />
However, it turned out to simply be {{Color|buzzword|Kairagi and Vagrants}} banding together to cause trouble. As such, I see little need to act against them so openly.<br />
Therefore, I have enclosed here a commission for a brave warrior to go forth and strike them down. They shall be rewarded handsomely, of course.
