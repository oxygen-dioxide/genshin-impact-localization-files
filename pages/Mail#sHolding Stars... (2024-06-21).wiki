|text      = Recently, the kids wanted to have a go at the Test of Courage but were too afraid of the dark. So I went into the woods and caught some fireflies to make small night lamps for them.

As I watched the fireflies twinkle and shine, it felt tike I was holding stars in the palm of my hand.

And that gave me a most brilliant idea! I wanted to create star-shaped fireworks that could be held! Hehe, and after days of trying, I finally succeeded!

From now on, whenever you find yourself walking in the dark, just light up this "Star Firework." That's how I'll give you strength! Never fear, Yoimiya is here— Heh, I know you're not a child anymore, but I still hope this tittle invention can bring some sparkles to your journey.

C'mon, let's hold some stars together!
