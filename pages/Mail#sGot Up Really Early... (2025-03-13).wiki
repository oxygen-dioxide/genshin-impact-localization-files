|text      = Yawn... I set my alarm way too early today, so I didn't get much sleep.

But hey, what can I do? Once I fall asleep, I'm out like a log. I can't just leave my friends waiting outside my door in the morning, right?

There was this one birthday, though, when [[Kachina]] showed up super early with a gift. When she saw I was still asleep, she just sat outside holding the box... all the way until sunset. I only woke up because [[Mavuika]] kicked down the door and practically dragged me out of bed...

After that, I made a special "birthday alarm clock" that only goes off on my birthday.

By the way, Kachina and I made a bunch of candies today while she was here. She says they turned out really good, so I saved some for you.

...Hmm, where's Mavuika? She's not up to something again, is she...?
