|text      = The [[Kamisato Clan]]'s meals are primarily planned for the purpose of entertaining guests and discussing important matters. As such, etiquette is the highest priority, and the food itself is of secondary importance. Though the chef takes such great care to prepare a variety of dishes, I do not have the chance to properly savor them, and it is an awful shame indeed.

On the date of my birthday, I always leave some time after the matters of the day have been taken care of. So I paid [[Komore Teahouse]] a visit alone, just to relish those flavors which I normally cannot enjoy fully.

Yet after carefully appreciating the dishes, I found that the taste seemed to be missing a certain something. Looking around the empty private room, I suddenly recalled the get-togethers we've had, and you.

Perhaps, the company of someone important is the indispensable seasoning these delicacies are lacking?

Please forgive me for being so impulsive, inviting you so abruptly for such a reason... But perhaps if you were here, only then would the pleasure of enjoying such a fine meal... be complete.
