A list of known common words of [[Hilichurlian]]. Please pay attention to the references.

Aside from official source, there is a fan project to decipher Hilichurlian prior to the event [[Mimi Tomo]] and [[Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian]]. The detailed analysis can be found in NGA: [https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=23771103 {{zh|本丘学家宣布已经基本破译了丘丘人语，并发现了丘丘人的神灵乌努}}]. As the dictionary was unofficial and sometimes conflicted with the official sources, this research would be put in a different column.
