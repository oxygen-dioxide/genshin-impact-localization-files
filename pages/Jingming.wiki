;(Talk to Jingming)
:'''Jingming:''' Hello, how may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Please tell me about [[Xiao Lantern]]s...
::'''Jingming:''' Xiao Lantern-making is a traditional craft form at [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]]. It's quite technical, you need to cut the paper, insert the wick, add wish sticks, paint it...
::'''Jingming:''' Sound like quite the ordeal, huh? Fortunately, if you know how to use a Crafting Bench, it makes thing much easier these days.
::'''Jingming:''' Hopefully, the gods don't think that cheapens the wishes we make.
::'''Jingming:''' The Crafting Bench is over there. Why not give it a try? The Lantern Rite only comes once a year.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye
::'''Jingming:''' May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.
