|description    = A type of open-air stall unique to Chuwen Fair, complete with moisture-resistant Peach Palm Wood furniture, a vibrantly colored fabric awning, and finely crafted metalworking tools. The renowned phlogiston paint shop Frida's Palette is a classic example of this design. Its most characteristic feature is the phlogiston paint processing device in the stall's center, allowing customers to witness the transformation of raw materials into finished products first-hand, thus fostering a subconscious trust in the quality of the goods. However, this kind of setup also tests the owner's crafting and business skills, as managing production, storage, and sales all in the same small space is no mean feat...
