==Description==
First, the sun and the moons were created, and thus day and night came to be. [[Nabu Malikata|She]] once described the night sky adorned with [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon|three bright moons]] to [[King Deshret|me]] in a language I have now forgotten &mdash; yes, the number of moons should be three.<br>
May the shadows of the world cast their pearly shimmer upon the earth when they awake, such that people can follow the silver-plated outline of the dunes at night to find their final fate.

Next, weight was created. Thus sand sank, forming the earth. And that which was without weight became the sky. I stipulated that one should rely on the earth, but dream of the sky.<br>
The weight should not be excessive, or the land will bind people's feet, impede those longing to travel far, and hinder expansion through exploration, while causing people to be unable to fly high, unable to explore the future.

Then the seven sage monks were established again, and they ruled the trajectories drawn by the earth, water, and stars. Even if the celestial sphere was just an illusion, myths are often born when people look up at the stars and moons.

In the original world, the barriers were torn down, and the [[Forbidden Knowledge|dark poison]] had penetrated the earth. To heal that fragile, sad, and imperfect world, the [[Celestial Nail|spikes]] descended and pierced through the earth's crust.<br>
However, the rules I have set are more elegant and precise, so there is no need and there should be no followers of hers who shall die meaninglessly on their account, and no poetry should be lost for their sake.

Next, the beastly trail from the poison should be cut off, for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky. But how sweet the whispers can be, and how clear the wisdom of which they speak...<br>
The wind arises in the new world. The pearly moonlight, the amber afterglow, the waves of grass, and the roots of the waters have gradually ceased to be silent, all singing the poems that she left behind.

...

The cycle of seven must be removed, because the secret narrative will be blocked.<br>
Fear and grief must be torn down, and so the barrier between life and death must be removed.<br>
Remove the sun, the moons, and weight, for there should be no barriers between time and space.<br>
Remove the original principles of rules, verdicts, and grace, so that she will no longer be afraid of the punishment that is laid on [[Seelie|her kin]].<br>
Remove birds, beasts, fish, dragons, humans, and seven monk-kings, so that none shall steal wisdom.

...

"The Sand King sleeps alone in secret dreams, drawing up new theorems."<br>
"None shall have to drink salt water in the King's realm, for everything in the new world shall be good."

...

This is how perfection can be achieved. I can see the three of us debating in [[Ay-Khanoum|our paradise]] once more. We are so close.<br>
Yes, this is splendid. I understand now. [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|This]] is what I have always wanted. That which I have always longed to find once more has never been a paradise for the many.<br>
All the parodies of the teachings and the seven wise monks, or that so-called pure world free of all sorrows, none of those things matter anymore...

But I do not wish that the poison ingested by mistake should remain in this world. Perhaps [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|she]] might, in light of our old friendship...<br>
&mdash; Even if she will not do it for my sake, that is also fine. I only ask that she do me one last favor for the sake of our mutual friend...

==Lore==
The description for Staff of the Scarlet Sands is narrated by [[King Deshret]], who created this staff alongside the [[Key of Khaj-Nisut]] as the keys to [[the Orchard of Pairidaeza]], the "eternal oasis" created as [[Nabu Malikata]]'s resting place.

Deshret begins with a story he learned from Nabu Malikata, of the [[Heavenly Principles]]'s creation of the world and of the three moon sisters, [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon]]. This world was destroyed after [[forbidden knowledge]] (the "dark poison") was introduced to Teyvat, by Dragon King [[Nibelung]] during his attempt to take the world back from the usurper.<ref name="What Shape">{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref> This event also saw the arrival of other outworlders,<ref name="AmeCrown">{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref> including the [[Second Who Came]]<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|title=Before Sun and Moon}}</ref> ("the barriers were torn down").

By the end of the war, the Heavenly Principles suppressed forbidden knowledge with the [[Celestial Nail]]s (the "spikes")<ref name="What Shape" /> and, no longer able to suppress the original world due to the injuries it sustained during the war, created a new order.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision}}</ref> The three moon sisters perished, with only one of their corpses remaining.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Moonlit Bamboo Forest|3}}</ref> The [[Seelie]] were punished with exile and many were stripped of their intellect, becoming reduced to their wispy present-day forms.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|4|title=Mountain Spirit}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Ay-Khanoum's Myriad}}</ref> Nabu Malikata was an exiled Seelie<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For the Children of the Past}}</ref> who retained her intellect, but was cursed to never look again at the heavens.<ref name="AmeCrown"/> As a result, Deshret's ideal world involved removing the "original principles" so "she [would] no longer be afraid of the punishment that is laid on her kin."

Despite knowing the dangers of forbidden knowledge and the Heavenly Principles' fear of it<ref name="AmeCrown" /> ("for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky"), Deshret was enthralled by its potential as he grew increasingly obsessed with creating his ideal world and subverting the Heavenly Principles. Nabu Malikata supported him and ultimately sacrificed herself to help realize his ambition,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Secret-Keeper's Magic Bottle}}</ref> but [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] &mdash; who had, for a time, joined the two at [[Ay-Khanoum]] ("our paradise") &mdash; disagreed with their ideals and returned to [[Dharma Forest]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III}}</ref> When the forbidden knowledge Deshret consumed unintentionally spread to his civilization and caused widespread plagues, he hoped Rukkhadevata would lend her assistance in suppressing it ("Perhaps she might, in light of our old friendship... [...] I only ask that she do me one last favor for the sake of our mutual friend..."). She did, even consuming so much power in the process that her form turned into a child's.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>
