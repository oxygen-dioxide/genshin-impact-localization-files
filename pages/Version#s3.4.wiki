* Adjusts the DMG dealt by the Elemental Skills "[[Blustering Blade]]" and "[[Frosty Assault]]" of the Character Card "[[Maguu Kenki (Character Card)|Maguu Kenki]]" in Genius Invokation TCG: these two Elemental Skills will no longer deal DMG, and will only summon "[[Shadowsword: Lone Gale]]" and "[[Shadowsword: Galloping Frost]]," respectively.
