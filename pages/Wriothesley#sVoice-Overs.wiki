|vo_01_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Hello.ogg
|vo_01_01_tx         = Hello, please try to quickly summarize your intents and goals for this meeting. Oh? You're not here for business? Well, that just makes me even more nervous.<br>Alright, then perhaps we should sit down and discuss things in a little more detail... Oh, and you can call me "Your Grace." That's what they all call me down in the [[Fortress of Meropide|Fortress]], and... well, I kinda got used to it.

|vo_02_01_title      = Chat: Stickers
|vo_02_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Chat - Stickers.ogg
|vo_02_01_tx         = If you ever see any stickers on my back, do me a favor and take them off... [[Melusine]]s like to play pranks sometimes.

|vo_02_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Chat - Pets.ogg
|vo_02_02_tx         = I once considered keeping some pets in my office, but soon gave up on the idea. It's just not right to keep small animals where they won't be able to see the sun.

|vo_02_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Chat - Words of Advice.ogg

|vo_03_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} When It Rains.ogg
|vo_03_01_tx         = Oh, it's raining? That's alright. A real problem would be if we could feel water dripping on our heads in the Fortress of Meropide.

|vo_03_02_title      = When Thunder Strikes
|vo_03_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} When Thunder Strikes.ogg
|vo_03_02_tx         = You know, they say if you're scared of the thunder, it's really because you've got something else to hide.

|vo_03_03_title      = When It Snows
|vo_03_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} When It Snows.ogg

|vo_04_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Good Afternoon.ogg
|vo_04_02_tx         = The [[Coupon Cafeteria]] is probably crowded right now. I'll have someone deliver the food straight to my office.

|vo_04_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Good Evening.ogg
|vo_04_03_tx         = Huh, is it evening already? Could have sworn I'd just had my afternoon tea.

|vo_04_04_title      = Good Night
|vo_04_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Good Night.ogg
|vo_04_04_tx         = Good night. I'll be staying up for a little while yet &mdash; want to run some numbers while everything's nice and quiet.

|vo_05_01_title      = About {character}: Misunderstanding
|vo_05_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Misunderstanding.ogg
|vo_05_01_tx         = People have this tendency to see me as an all-knowing figure with mystical powers. In reality, I'm just one man with two eyes and two ears. How can I possibly know everything that's happening in the Fortress of Meropide?

|vo_05_02_title      = About {character}: Small Breaks
|vo_05_02_quest      = Reborn in the Land of Grievances
|vo_05_02_friendship = 4
|vo_05_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Small Breaks.ogg
|vo_05_02_tx         = I finished serving my sentence long ago, so there's nothing stopping me from taking an occasional breather in the overworld as a free citizen.<br>Ah, there's no need to worry... The Fortress of Meropide doesn't currently have any problem so big as to require my round-the-clock presence to operate effectively.

|vo_06_01_title      = About Us: Committing to Jail
|vo_06_01_quest      = Cataclysm's Quickening
|vo_06_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Committing to Jail.ogg
|vo_06_01_tx         = I form my first impressions of many people based on the contents of their inmate registration papers. Seems like you're no exception to the rule.

|vo_06_02_title      = About Us: Finishing the Jail Term
|vo_06_02_quest      = Cataclysm's Quickening
|vo_06_02_friendship = 6

|vo_06_02_tx         = They say it's best to begin a friendship when there's no conflict of interest. Seems like the appropriate time has come.

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = Some inmates once taught me a way to wield the elements by [[Treasure Hoarder Potioneer|throwing around chemical potions]]. I guess whoever's in charge of handing out Visions doesn't care too much about a little rule-bending.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = Want a tip on how to escape from the [[Gardes]]? Just give yourself a name that's really long and difficult to pronounce. They'll be stumbling over your name as soon as they try to announce that you are under arrest.

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = "If a man will not work, he shall not eat." This phrase has been on the walls of the Fortress of Meropide for as long as anyone can remember. I don't know who first came up with it, but it's been pretty useful in the underworld.

|vo_08_01_title      = About [[Neuvillette]]
|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Neuvillette.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = I was once summoned by Neuvillette to discuss some matters with him in his office. When I approached the [[Palais Mermonia]], I saw him standing by the road, completely drenched in the rain. I held out an umbrella for him, and while he thanked me politely, his expression was a little... distressed, I guess. I can only assume that I had disturbed him in the middle of something.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Neuvillette

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Furina]]
|vo_08_02_quest      = Reborn in the Land of Grievances
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Furina.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Miss Furina displayed a severe lack of interest in my trial and excused herself early, probably because I pleaded guilty to all charges as soon as they were announced. Disappointing the [[Hydro Archon]] is a big deal, so... suppose I've got no choice but to keep gifting her copious amounts of the highest quality tea.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Furina

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Sigewinne]]

|vo_08_03_tx         = Sigewinne the head nurse possesses all the virtues associated with the medical profession and genuinely cares for the well-being of everyone around her.<br>She seems to have picked up some bad habits from me, though, like frequently betting with her Melusine friends over who'd be able to put more stickers on my belongings. Hm? No, I'm not actually bothered by it.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Sigewinne

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Clorinde]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Clorinde.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Clorinde is the best [[Champion Duelist]] you can find. Her combat prowess is already the stuff of legend. I've never fought her myself, but that's because there's never been a need for it.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Clorinde

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Lyney]]
|vo_08_05_quest      = Cataclysm's Quickening
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Lyney.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = I'll admit that when I removed the [[House of the Hearth]]'s spies in the underworld, that was kind of an intentional provocation to the [[Fatui]]. But their only response was to send down a bunch of children... Was it because they truly saw those kids as disposable? Or because they knew I wouldn't have it in me to let them come to serious harm? *sigh*
|vo_08_05_mention    = Lyney

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Navia]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Navia.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = The Fortress of Meropide works with [[Spina di Rosula]] on some matters regarding supplies and logistics, but we don't have any other dealings. This isn't because I don't trust Navia or her abilities, in fact, I hold her in quite high regard. The only reason we continue to stay out of each other's way is because I wanna honor the agreement I made with the late Mr. [[Callas]].
|vo_08_06_mention    = Navia,Callas

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Emilie]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Emilie.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = The Fortress of Meropide doesn't need her services. Yet some things are best preserved the way they are, warts and all, so people don't make the same mistakes twice... I say warts, but yeah. I mean the smell.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Emilie

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Chevreuse]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4

|vo_08_08_tx         = Most inmates seem to gain a new level of respect for the rules after receiving attention from the [[Special Security and Surveillance Patrol]]. As the captain, Chevreuse is an instrumental part of that team.

|vo_09_01_title      = More About {character}: I
|vo_09_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 01.ogg

|vo_09_02_friendship = 3
|vo_09_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 02.ogg
|vo_09_02_tx         = Hmm? Oh the scar on my body? It's from a gash I got while battling a gigantic undersea monster that tried to take over the Fortress of Meropide.&nbsp;...Hah, just kidding.

|vo_09_03_title      = More About {character}: III
|vo_09_03_friendship = 4
|vo_09_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 03.ogg
|vo_09_03_tx         = Did you know, many similar models of handcuffs can all be unlocked using the same master key? Except mine, of course. They're different.

|vo_09_04_title      = More About {character}: IV
|vo_09_04_quest      = Cataclysm's Quickening
|vo_09_04_friendship = 5
|vo_09_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 04.ogg
|vo_09_04_tx         = Honestly, my personal abilities are pretty limited. I got no talent in medicine, inventions, or ship-making. But what I do know how to do is find those people with those talents, and get 'em to come work for me.

|vo_09_05_title      = More About {character}: V
|vo_09_05_quest      = Reborn in the Land of Grievances
|vo_09_05_friendship = 6
|vo_09_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 05.ogg
|vo_09_05_tx         = I've managed to get myself to a pretty comfortable place in life, but there's still some things I want that are outside my reach, like a peaceful and happy childhood, or the ability to trust other people. Maybe some people would see those feelings as shameful or contradictory, but I don't see a problem with sharing them. After all, why should anybody be afraid to admit what they want?

|vo_10_01_title      = {character}'s Hobbies
|vo_10_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Hobbies.ogg
|vo_10_01_tx         = Boxing? To me, that's more of a necessity than a hobby. You got some suggestions for actual hobbies?

|vo_10_02_title      = {character}'s Troubles
|vo_10_02_quest      = Reborn in the Land of Grievances
|vo_10_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Troubles.ogg
|vo_10_02_tx         = While I do possess some stereotypical Fontainian looks, when you're an orphan, you can never really be sure where you're from. Who knows, maybe I'll take a dip in the [[Primordial Sea]] one of these days just to check...

|vo_10_03_title      = Favorite Food

|vo_12_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Birthday.ogg
|vo_12_01_tx         = Our tradition says that all children of [[Fontaine]] are born amid their parents' wishes and blessings, but I'd like to think that all children are born from such wonderful feelings. Anything that I can say to celebrate your birth would feel a little trivial next to that, right?<br>Unfortunately, I won't be able to reduce your prison sentence if you were to commit a crime &mdash; the only thing I would be able to pull off would be a special [[Welfare Meal]] for your birthday dinner. With all that in mind, why don't you try to respect the law a bit more around your birthday, so we'll be able to celebrate somewhere nice on the surface?

|vo_13_01_title      = Feelings About Ascension: Intro
|vo_13_01_ascension  = 1

|vo_13_04_ascension  = 6
|vo_13_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Feelings About Ascension - 04.ogg
|vo_13_04_tx         = I like signs of strength and hope. They give me reassurance that tomorrow will be better than today. This isn't to be pessimistic, but it's impossible for the present to be without its doubts and troubles &mdash; that's just the truth. But come hell or high water, if nothing else then at least we'll be able to figure it out together, right?
