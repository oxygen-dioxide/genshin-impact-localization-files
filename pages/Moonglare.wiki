'''Moonglare''' is [[Arlecchino]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
Arlecchino's outfit consists of a "X"-shaped white-greyish overcoat that has long tails with a red lining, a fitted grey shirt with asymmetric tails in the front, a short white tie bearing the symbol of the [[Fatui]] in red and black, sleeves with short red-edged black ruffles, and black fitted pants that flare out just above the ankles. The skin of her hands and forearms is blackened due to her curse, with long fingernails painted red, and she wears several rings. She wears stiletto heels with a gray tone and reddish details and white "+"-shaped earrings. Her {{Pyro}} [[Vision]] is attached to the back of her overcoat at the nape of her neck.
