'''Mysterious Murals''' are an exploration mechanic found in [[Great Red Sand]], [[Sumeru]].

Mysterious Murals are found in sets of two. During daytime, they will display a distorted image and cannot be interacted with. During nighttime (18:00 – 06:00), they can be interacted with to spawn enemies. Once all enemies spawned by both Mysterious Murals are defeated, a [[Chest]] will spawn. The enemies spawn from these Murals do not drop anything.
