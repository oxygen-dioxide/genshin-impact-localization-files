{{Lang|'''Cyno'''|grc=κύων|grc_rm=kúōn}}, also known as '''General Mahamatra''', is a character in ''Genshin Impact'' and represents [[Sumeru]] in [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]. He also makes a brief but noteworthy appearance in the [[Manga]], sent by [[Sumeru Akademiya]] at [[Lisa]]'s behest to treat [[Collei]]'s affliction.<ref name="M12">{{Ref/Manga|12}}</ref>

In his official character art, he can be seen wielding a [[polearm]].

==Profile==
===Personality===
Cyno is a knowledgeable scholar from Sumeru Akademiya who prefers keeping things clear and concise. He comes across as curt and stoic in his Manga appearances, his first words being a stern ''"Hands off."'' when [[Amber]] was about to touch Lisa's potions. However, he did so to prevent her from accidentally turning herself into a pig, displaying his knowledge in potions and his more considerate side.

===Appearance===
Cyno is a young man with tan skin, red-orange eyes, and medium-length grey hair.

Cyno's clothes appear to be inspired by traditional outfits that were worn during the Ancient Egyptian civilization. His headpiece resembles the head of Anubis, a jackal-headed deity, also known as the God of the mummification. The kilt-like garment Cyno wears is reminiscent of the Shendyt, which was a popular men's clothing, usually depicted on Ancient Egyptian commoners, rulers and even deities.

In the manga, Cyno is depicted wearing a large, black cape including a hood with what looks like jackal ears sewn on it, matching the aforementioned headpiece. His cape seems to be of inspiration from Northern Africa, showing some similarities with the large capes worn in the Sahara in order to avoid the heat, and to stay protected during sandstorms.

==Other Appearances==
===Manga===
After learning about Collei's affliction, which caused by an injection of ancient gods' remains (archon residue) given to her by the [[Fatui]], [[Jean]] brought Lisa a relevant document about the Fatui's experiements, hoping she would be able to read the ancient language it was written in. While Lisa was unable to read the document herself, she knew someone at Sumeru Akademiya who did and sent a letter to her former teacher regarding the matter.

Cyno was sent to handle the matter and arrived in Mondstadt three days later, just as Fatui personnel led by [[Barnabas]] arrived to retrieve their documents and apprehend the person who killed their diplomats &mdash; Collei. Cyno brought Amber and Collei to [[Starsnatch Cliff]] to seal the gods' remains away<ref name="M12" /> and successfully put them into a dormant state. Tired from the ordeal, Cyno returned to the City of Mondstadt first and was not present when Barnabas attacked Amber and Collei.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|13}}</ref>

After Barnabas was defeated and Collei was absolved of her involvement in the Black Fire Incident thanks to [[Diluc]] and [[Kaeya]]'s plan, Collei decided to return to Sumeru with Cyno.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|16}}</ref>

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The English prefix {{wt|cyno-|cyno|English}} is derived from the Ancient Greek {{lang|mini=1|grc=κύων|grc_rm=kúōn|grc_tl=dog,}} which could be a reference to {{w|Anubis}}-like headdress.
* {{lang|{{w|Mahamatra}}|sa=महामात्र|ta_tl=Officer of High Rank,}} full title ''Dhaṃma Mahāmātā'', were "officers of morality" established by the Indian emperor {{w|Ashoka}} and were in charge of religious affairs.
