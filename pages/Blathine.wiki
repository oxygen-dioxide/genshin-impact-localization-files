{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Blathine:''' Up and down the fountain goes &mdash; it's like a magic trick.
:{{DIcon}} Do you like magic?
::'''Blathine:''' Yup.
::'''Blathine:''' I've got good enough eyes to catch even the smallest details at a crime scene, but I can't understand the secrets of magic tricks.
::'''Blathine:''' Magicians really are awesome, to be able to fool even a Melusine's eyes.
:{{DIcon}} Do you like fountains?
::'''Blathine:''' Yup, I do. Fountain water never stops &mdash; it's full of life!
::'''Blathine:''' Take these tall pillars of water, especially &mdash; sometimes they're up, and sometimes they're down. Aren't they like the music that plays in the background during an opera?
::'''Blathine:''' That said, I don't really like watching performances at the [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]]. They're created, engineered human behavior &mdash; they're not real to me.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Blathine:''' Bye! Take care not to let the fountain get you wet.
