{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo hseq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Time to meet up with Candace! Hopefully Dori got the intel we asked for!
:{{A|vo hseq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head over and check!

;(Approach Candace)
:{{A|vo hseq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Candace, you're here! Have you seen Dori?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' She just left. I got here early, and she had already started doing business, so we wrapped things up right away.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' She left the city as soon as I handed her the travel permit and tax waiver I promised.
:{{A|vo hseq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, she sure didn't waste any time...
:{{A|vo hseq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, how'd it go? Did she tell you where the gem came from?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Yes. According to the local gem merchants, the ore was retrieved from a nameless ruin in the desert several months ago. The ruin is in very poor condition. Even the writing on the walls is nearly impossible to read.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 04.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Dori mentioned something even more concerning, though. Apparently, the craftsman made another gem just like this one.
:{{A|vo hseq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, there's two?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 05.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Yes. The ore had a crack down the middle. The craftsman believed it would be impossible to repair, so they turned it into two gems instead.
:{{A|vo hseq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, where's the other gem now?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 06.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' That's exactly what I'd like to know. If this gem truly provides the power of foresight, the consequences could be detrimental in the wrong hands.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 07.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Funny enough, I heard a caravan was robbed just this morning, in a remote part of the desert.
:{{A|vo hseq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You think it's related to the other gem?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 08.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I can't say for sure, but I do know this... Only small-scale caravans or ones carrying important goods travel on remote paths like that, and their routes are highly confidential...
:{{DIcon}} So what you're saying is...
:{{DIcon}} Whoever attacked the caravan was able to "predict" its exact location.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 09.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' It's certainly possible.
:{{A|vo hseq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like we need to investigate the site of the robbery... But, what about the preparations for the [[Sabzeruz Festival]]?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 10.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' [[Dehya]] said we can meet up with everyone later. If we hurry, we should be able to get back in time.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 11.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Of course, if you have other plans, please don't feel obliged to come with me.
:{{A|vo hseq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, we're in this together! There's no way we're backing out now!
:{{DIcon}} Let's head out!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 2 candace 12.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I should've known you would say that. Thank you for all your help.
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 3 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I believe the robbery took place not too far from here.
:{{A|vo hseq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, we really are in the middle of nowhere...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 3 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, over here.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 3 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Do you sense that?
:{{DIcon}} I sense a trace amount of [[elemental]] energy.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 3 candace 04.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Exactly. Many among the desert tribes are capable of wielding elemental energy. The same is true for the [[Eremites]]. Some use that power to attack caravans and earn some quick Mora.
:{{A|vo hseq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, are those... broken planks over there?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 3 candace 05.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Yes. All that's left of the transport wagon, I would imagine. Strange... the wood looks charred. Was there an explosion?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 3 candace 06.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I see traces of activity over there. Let's follow the road and see what we can find.

;(Follow Candace to the round package on the ground)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Candace:''' Looks like something left behind by the caravan...

;(Follow Candace to the waterskin on the ground)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 4 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' The traces are pointing this way...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 4 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Let's go up.

;(Follow Candace to more round packages on the ground)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Candace:''' These too...
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Candace:''' Shouldn't be far now...

;(Approach the caravan members with Candace)
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 01.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' *sigh* I can't believe this. We made sure to pick a remote path, and we still got ambushed...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Excuse me, sorry for the interruption...
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 02.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Ahhh...! Who's there?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I'm Candace, the guardian of [[Aaru Village]]. I'm trying to learn more about the robbery that took place this morning.
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 hizir 01.ogg}} '''Hizir:''' G&mdash;Guardian!?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 03.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Calm down, I think we're safe. Pretty sure stealing's not in a guardian's job description.
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 hizir 02.ogg}} '''Hizir:''' Oh, yeah... right...
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 04.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Don't mind him. Some of our guys are still on edge after the robbery this morning...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I can sympathize, of course. There's no need to be nervous. Although... is this where you plan to set up camp? Caravan Ribat isn't far, you know...
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 05.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' *sigh* The robbery took everything from us. We can't just let that slide. So, I'm taking my men to confront them, and get back some of what they stole, at least.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 04.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I would caution against that, especially when it looks like you're low on rations as it is. In the desert, impulsivity and overconfidence can be fatal.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 05.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' What was it that you were transporting?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 hizir 03.ogg}} '''Hizir:''' Hazardous materials.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 06.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Excuse me?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 06.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' For the love of... You can't just say that! Listen, it was just some firecrackers and fireworks, that's all!
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 hizir 04.ogg}} '''Hizir:''' But, that's what the crates had written on them...
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 07.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' They're fireworks. What else would they be labeled as? "Perishable goods"?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 08.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' *sigh* Just... ignore him, please. As you can see, some of my guys aren't particularly bright. If the guards at Caravan Ribat hear of this, we'll get questioned all over again...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (So the charred marks on the planks... are from the fireworks?)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 07.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' And where were you sending those goods?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 09.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' To some tribal camps in the desert. Everybody's looking to celebrate with the Sabzeruz Festival coming up.
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 10.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Even small businesses like us got a share of the orders, mostly the long-distance transports that no one else wanted.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 08.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I see... Could you describe the robbery to us?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 11.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Well, it was like this... We had just set out on the remote path when&mdash;
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 hizir 05.ogg}} '''Hizir:''' A web of thorns and vines suddenly blocked our way!
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Vines?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 12.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' What? No, why would there be vines in the desert? Our wagon got stuck in the sand, that's what happened. I'm sure it was a trap!
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 13.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' After that&mdash;
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 hizir 06.ogg}} '''Hizir:''' Bombs started falling from the sky!
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bombs?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 14.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Just... stop talking. That robbery messed you up more than I thought.
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 15.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Don't listen to his nonsense. He's just a bit... shaken up by what happened.
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 16.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Anyway, as we were trapped, the bandits started firing rockets at us, which made a lot of the fireworks go off. In the middle of all the chaos, they ran off with the rest of our stuff.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 09.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Did you see what they looked like?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 17.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Ah, no... we couldn't really see anything. There was sand everywhere, and we were more preoccupied with getting out alive...
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 18.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Although, I did notice that one of the bandits had this green stone...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 10.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' ...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 11.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Did it look anything like this?
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 19.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Yes! Exactly like that! I just couldn't make sense of it... If you already have something that valuable, why go after our cheap firecrackers?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Unless the "hazardous materials" were targeted for some other reason...)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 12.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Alright, I think I understand the situation. Thank you for your cooperation.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 13.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I would still urge you to head to Caravan Ribat and report the incident. For your own safety, don't let your anger lead you to do something foolish.
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 20.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' Well... alright. We'll just take another quick break before we head over...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 14.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Good. Let's go.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 15.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Alright, we should be out of ear-shot. So... what do you think, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} ...I'm not sure about their goods.
:{{DIcon}} ...I'm not sure about their identity.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 16.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Yes, I feel the same way. Their leader was clearly hiding something. I think we can safely say those weren't simple firework shipments.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 17.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' And now, whatever "hazardous materials" they were transporting have fallen into the hands of another group of bandits.
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So one group of bad guys attacked the other...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 18.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' It's very possible. In any case, our biggest concern right now is the group that currently has the goods, and what their goal may be...
:{{DIcon}} The Sabzeruz Festival is coming up...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 19.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I see what you mean. Their methods were precise and effective. It's very likely they're exploiting the visions granted by the gem.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 5 candace 20.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' The situation could be even more precarious than we thought. Mmm... I don't think we should hide this any longer. Let's head back to Caravan Ribat and explain the situation to the guards.

;(Talk to [[Hizir]] or [[Yakup]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog hseq002 yakup 01.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' If you don't know what to say, then don't say anything at all! You have to stop interrupting me!
:{{A|vo dialog hseq002 hizir 01.ogg}} '''Hizir:''' But, I was just telling the truth...
:{{A|vo dialog hseq002 yakup 02.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' *sigh* You're hopeless...

;(Talk to [[Aruj]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog hseq002 aruj 01.ogg}} '''Aruj:''' Ugh... my leg...

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Yakup, optional)
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 yakup 21.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' (It's hard enough transporting all these goods, and I'm stuck with this idiot... *sigh* It's just one thing after another...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Hizir, optional)
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 hizir 07.ogg}} '''Hizir:''' (There were bombs falling from the sky! I saw them!)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Aruj, optional)
:{{A|vo hseq002 5 aruj 01.ogg}} '''Aruj:''' (It hurts...)

;(Approach Caravan Ribat)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 6 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Rest here for now, you two. I'll be back as soon as I've spoken to the guards.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes the Sabzeruz Festival doesn't get ruined. Things are turning out to be more complicated than we expected...
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Oh? And what "things" would those be? Sounds like something the General Mahamatra should know about.
:{{Introductory Note|Cyno}}
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Cyno]]! What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'm here on business, investigating an unusual robbery case.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, could it be the same one we've been investigating!?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like you've been hard at work.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Just doing my duty. By the way, I brought something that I think might help with the investigation. Here, have some [[Padisarah Pudding]].
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... okay! Thanks!
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Well, find any clues? They say the "proof is in the pudding," after all.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *coughing*...! Did you have to tell that joke when Paimon had a mouthful of pudding! She almost choked...
:{{DIcon}} Very funny...
:{{DIcon}} Don't tell me you did all that just to make a joke...
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Anyway, back to the matter at hand. Tell me about this robbery case of yours.
:;(They tell Cyno about the case)
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...I see, so you and Candace already did a preliminary investigation.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! Candace can tell you the rest when she gets back. That merchant group was really suspicious!
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, you can leave the rest to me.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' On a different note, do you have any other plans for the day?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we'll probably head back with Candace! We're meeting up with everyone to prepare for the su&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} P&mdash;Paimon!
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Su&mdash;... Super awesome dinner we're planning tonight!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Cyno's working quarters aren't too far from Nahida's... Did [[Tighnari]] tell him about the surprise?)
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Strange. Sounds like you're hiding something from me.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? N&mdash;No, not at all! We'd never do anything like that!
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Do you know why [[Henna Berries]] can't tell a lie?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Wh&mdash;Why?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Because... they're always going to be "read" straight through.
:{{DIcon}} ...
::{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 13a 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Get it? Like the color... I can explain it if you need.
::{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 11a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We get it! We get it!
:{{DIcon}} Haha, good one.
::{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 13b 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You think so? Then, tell me your secret!
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' S&mdash;Seriously! There's no secret!
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Is that so? You're not afraid of ending up like the bass in the lake?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What...?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Because, they always wind up eating their "worms."
:{{DIcon}} I can't do this anymore...
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Who knew being interrogated by the General Mahamatra was this miserable...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 6 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Hmm? Someone's being interrogated? Did I miss something?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Candace! Thank goodness you're back! Please save us!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 6 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' What happened? Can't be anything too bad, if Cyno's grinning from ear to ear.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Nice to see you, Candace.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 17.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' {{Traveler}} already updated me on everything, so you can leave the robbery case to me.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 18a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 18b.ogg}}--> '''Cyno:''' But, when I asked about their plans this afternoon, they started dodging my questions.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 6 candace 04.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' This afternoon... Aren't we heading back to Port Ormos to work on the "surprise"?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C&mdash;Candace! It... It's supposed to be a secret!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 6 candace 05.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' It's alright. Cyno has always been part of the plan.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? Why didn't you say something sooner!?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 19.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Well, once you told me about the case, I realized I might not make it this afternoon. I was going to ask you to tell the group, but you decided to end the conversation.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously!? So, we had to listen to a couple of Cyno jokes for nothing?
:{{DIcon}} It was three jokes, actually...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 6 candace 06.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Right, we never told you who was involved... Apologies. That was our mistake.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 20.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Well, with that resolved, could you tell the group I've got a case?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 21.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Oh, and these are the items I was supposed to get. Could you take them back with you?
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing! We've got this!
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 cyno 22.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I would hope so. I just handed it to you.
:{{A|vo hseq002 6 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Enough already!
----
;(Approach the marked location in Port Ormos)
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... We're back. Finally free from all those terrible jokes...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Haha, I rarely get to spend time with Cyno outside of work. I'm sure he's just happy you came back for the Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That explains why he had all those jokes ready to go, even while on the job... Paimon will never understand how he doesn't give himself a cringe attack...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Ah...! Ugh...
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Candace? Did you have another vision?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Yes... I saw... two people enter the alley over there...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 04.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' They seemed suspicious... I think they were talking about something dangerous...
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dangerous!? Maybe they're the bandits from earlier!
:{{DIcon}} Did you see what they looked like?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 05.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' No... Unfortunately, the visions are very blurry. I could only catch a few words and some vague images...
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, let's sneak up on them! If they're the ones looking to cause trouble during the Sabzeruz Festival, we should catch them in the act!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 01.ogg}}  -->'''???:''' ...know nothing...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 01.ogg}}  -->'''???:''' ...secret signal...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 02.ogg}}  -->'''???:''' ...explosion goes off...
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, did you hear that? Sounds like they're talking about something dangerous...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 06.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Let's try to get closer.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 03.ogg}}  -->'''???:''' ...when... passes by on the Flower Carriage... we'll launch it...

:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, it's you two? What kind of terrible plan were you talking about just now?
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Something about explosions, and the Flower Carriage...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 03.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' The connections we make reveal a lot about the mind. The fact that you went to a dark place simply shows the way you think.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 06.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Honestly, Paimon, what did you think we were doing? We were just discussing the birthday surprise.
:{{Black Screen|Not long ago...}}
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 07.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Like I said, that's not it! We have more than just a heartless, transactional relationship... You're overthinking the whole thing!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 04.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' It was your theory in the first place... that [[Mehrak]] disappeared after working for you all this time without anything in return.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 08.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' I think I'm allowed some dramatics! Mehrak hasn't come back since I sent it out for coffee!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 05.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Perhaps seeing the underlings at the [[Akademiya]] pick up coffee for their seniors taught Mehrak something about its own situation.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 09.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' You're saying I treat Mehrak like my inferior? I would never! I'm just worried Mehrak had some sort of awful experience and decided to run away.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 10.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Maybe something triggered an existential crisis, and Mehrak became so angry about its mechanical existence... it decided to never come back!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 06.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' That's certainly an... imaginative conclusion.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 11.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' No, that's impossible... I created Mehrak myself, and I perform regular maintenance every week. There's no way Mehrak would be that heartless...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 07.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' And here you are in Port Ormos, telling me all this when I'm supposed to be working.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 12.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' It's good I ran in to you, actually. I was hoping you could take a look at my proposal.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 08.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Huh, I thought you were confident in your abilities.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 13.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' It's not like that! I just wanted to confirm the route for the Flower Carriage.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 09.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Unfortunately, I know nothing about the route for the Flower Carriage.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 14.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' What? You're not involved in the Festival at all? The Akademiya couldn't convince you to help out?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 10.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Organizing festivals is not part of my job description. You really think the Akademiya could convince me otherwise?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 15.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' You've got a point... Well, could you at least take a look at the final explosion?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 11.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Explosion?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 16.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Yep. The candy tower I designed is going to hit the Flower Carriage at a designated time and explode into pieces, shooting candy in all directions.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 17.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Not the dangerous kind of explosion, though. It's supposed to look like fireworks.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 18.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' I consulted a bunch of food engineering papers, so it's completely safe. The candy is soft, and the packaging is as smooth as Silk Flower fabric.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 19.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Once I receive the secret signal, Mehrak will activate the mechanism from afar. That way, I can make sure the explosion goes off at the right time and place.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 12.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' And when is that supposed to be?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 20.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' When the [[Dendro Archon]] passes by on the Flower Carriage. Once we receive the signal, we'll launch it, and... KABOOM!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 13.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Don't forget to factor in the object's trajectory and the humidity level.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 21.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Already done! The mechanism inside the candy tower controls for those factors. The plan is completely foolproof.
:;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... So that's what all this was about...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 14.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' You had your mind set on a very different interpretation.
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, well... about that...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 08.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' It's alright. Let me explain.
:;(Candace explains the situation)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 22.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' The ability to see the future? That's incredible...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 15.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Fascinating.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 16.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' You formulated a hypothesis based on your interpretation of the gem's abilities, yet the results fail to corroborate it.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 17.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Perhaps this calls for a different postulation.
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, maybe you could dumb that down a little?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 18.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' You assumed you were seeing the future. But, what if you were actually seeing the past?
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The past?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 19.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' [[Jahangir]] said this was the second time his wind generator broke down. Mechanical failures of that nature come with predictable consequences. His lack of surprise suggests something similar happened in the past.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 20.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' As for the falling crates... During a busy time like the Sabzeruz Festival, people often stack their crates on both sides of the street, likely leading to similar accidents.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 21.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' Seeing people have a private conversation in a secluded place is even more common.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 09.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' So, you're saying... we just happened to witness events that have occurred before?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 22.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' It's easy for mundane events to appear special.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 23.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' So, either you can predict the future and make it deviate off course, or you happened to witness the past... Yeah, the second option seems a bit easier to swallow.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 23.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' That's not why I brought it up. I was simply trying to offer a change in perspective.
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, it does explain what we saw...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 24.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' The conditions and actions required to trigger this power are still unclear. If you plan to investigate further, you should pay attention to those two factors.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 24.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Speaking of a change in perspective... Maybe YOU were the one that scared Mehrak off!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 25.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' An ingenious thought... if Mehrak and I had never met before.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 25.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Yeah, Mehrak should be used to you, especially after I programmed it to recognize your voice... Something else must have happened.
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaveh, if Mehrak is missing, what's that thing coming towards us right now?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 26.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Hm? Mehrak!? Where have you been!?
:'''Mehrak:''' Beep-beep.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 27.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' You went to look for more coffee beans because the shop was out of stock? Hey, if they're out, they're out. You don't have to go that far...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Mehrak sure is persistent...)
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Candace? Something on your mind?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 candace 10.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I was just thinking about Mr. Alhaitham's theory. It makes sense, until we factor in the robbery in the desert...
:{{A|vo hseq002 7 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 tighnari 01.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' Oh, you're all here. Something wrong? You look troubled...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 kaveh 28.ogg}}  -->'''Kaveh:''' Just trying to work through some mysteries... Oh, right! It's almost time for our meeting. We'll catch you up on the way.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq002 7 alhaitham 26.ogg}}  -->'''Alhaitham:''' I'm needed at the [[House of Daena]]. See you later.
