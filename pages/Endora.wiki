'''Endora''' is a commemorative gadget obtained at the end of the [[Wishful Drops]] Event.

Endora is not a true gadget and is merely toggled on when equipped, thus regular gadgets can still be used as per normal. As it lacks the abilities which the Inquisitive version possesses, it is purely a cosmetic item.

==Notes==
* It cannot be used at the same time as any other [[Gadget]] of the "Equipment" type.

==Trivia==
* In Chinese, her name is transcribed as {{zh|嫣朵拉|rm=Yānduǒlā}}, where the character {{zh|嫣|rm=yān}} literally means "beautiful."
** Coincidentally, the character {{ja|{{Rubi|嫣|えん}}}} can be read as ''en'' in Japanese, which more closely matches her English name.
** In Japanese, her name is transcribed as {{ja|エンドラー|rm=Endoraa}}.
* Her name is quite similar to the name of an {{w|Oceanids|Oceanid}} from Greek mythology, {{w|Eudora (mythology)|Eudora}}.
* Endora may be derived from the city {{Lang|{{w|Endor (village)|Endor}}|he=עֵין־דֹּאר}} (derived from Hebrew {{Lang|mini=1|he=עַיִן|he_rm=ayin|he_tl=spring, fountain}} + {{Lang|mini=1|he=דּוֹר|he_rm=dor|he_tl=dwelling}}) which can mean "fountain of dwelling."<ref>Biblehub: [https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5874.htm 5874. En-dor or En Dor or En-dor] ''Strong's Concordance''</ref>
** Incidentally, the Lochfolk hail from the nation of [[Fontaine]], which means "fountain" in French.
