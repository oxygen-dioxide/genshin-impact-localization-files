'''Elemental Reactions''' are triggered by applying certain combinations of [[element]]al effects on a target (enemies, players, or objects).

When an element is applied to a target, it alone will usually last 9–12 seconds (sometimes longer) depending on the skill used, after which it will decay and disappear. The element will appear as a status symbol above or on the target and is sometimes referred to as an ''elemental aura''.

Elemental Reactions occur when applying multiple elements to a target (applying a second element to an existing elemental aura). Sometimes, the reaction will remove the elemental aura from the target. Other times, the elemental aura will remain and have its duration reduced. Sometimes, two elements may coexist simultaneously on the target. Exactly when each situation occurs depends on the skill applied and the specific Elemental Reaction.

Elemental Reactions have no cooldown, but skills have [[Internal Cooldown]] before being able to reapply their elemental effect.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jqwszi/keqingmains_cn_translation_the_truth_behind/ Reaction Cooldowns]</ref>

The specific details can be explained by [[Gauge Unit Theory]], a framework for understanding the duration of elemental auras, the internal cooldown of elemental applications, and how elemental reactions interact with them.<ref name="Gauge">KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSEovpheHaeum4Ba0MlNdfyOTsJ-wZzDmBof13bVztYtKDi6OQhLqNdwEkEApo6vvtAV0L_tMal2ZTN/pub#h.tkybj39mqnlv "Gauge Unit" Details]</ref>

Elemental Reactions have the following effects:

Elemental Reaction damage can be increased by the [[Elemental Mastery]] of the character causing the reaction. The in-game interface shows the damage bonus provided by the character's current elemental mastery. This bonus will be applied in different ways, depending on the type of reaction.

Two elemental reactions, [[Bloom]] and [[Catalyze]], are expected to come with the [[Version/3.0|Version 3.0]] update, after the release of Sumeru.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/6DjVUfy_Lng Sumeru Preview Teaser 01: The Fascinating Dendro Element | Genshin Impact]</ref>

==Transformative Reactions==

*Transformative Reactions include [[Overloaded]], [[Shattered]], [[Electro-Charged]], [[Superconduct]], and [[Swirl]].
* These reactions have a '''base damage''' determined by the level of the character triggering the reaction.
*This '''base damage''' is then multiplied by a percentage determined by the [[Elemental Mastery]] of the character. The percentage can be seen in-game in the Details section of the Attributes page.

* The damage from these reactions '''cannot crit''' and is '''only based on level''', meaning ATK, Crit Rate and Crit Damage have no impact. However, the damage is affected by the target's '''elemental resistance.'''
*Since Superconduct has the lowest '''base damage''', the other reactions can be expressed in multiplicative term of Superconduct base damage. For [[Superconduct]], [[Swirl]], [[Electro-Charged]], [[Shattered]] and [[Overloaded]], these values ​​are approximately 1: 1.2: 2.4: 3: 4 respectively. So it can be said, for example, that Overloaded base damage is approximately 4× Superconduct base damage (all other factors being equal).<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/j580by/elemental_mastery_damage_increase/ Elemental Mastery Damage Increase]</ref><ref>Community Document: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTqdXsZuo1qGJWjyQ3LTDlIr5fw9lvhJnW_jRIuOCJqkTlPhG1EQI5F4dV7x71kE8EEuWKFMLUq_vd9/pubhtml# Genshin Resources 3.1]</ref>
* The reaction damage will be an '''additional instance''' of damage on top of the damage from the skill, making it difficult to discern due to the overlapping damage displayed values.

==Amplifying Reactions==
* Amplifying Reactions include [[Vaporize]] and [[Melt]].
* Unlike transformative reactions, Melt and Vaporize '''replace''' the damage of the attack(s) that triggered them.
* These reactions '''multiply''' damage of existing attacks by either 1.5× or 2× depending on which element triggers the reaction.
* Damage from these reactions '''can be critical''' and considers the target's '''elemental resistance'''.
* The damage is multiplied again by a percentage determined by the [[Elemental Mastery]] of the character. The percentage can be seen in-game in the Details section of the Attributes page.
* The bonus % to Vaporize and Melt is roughly half of that to [[Overloaded]], [[Superconduct]], [[Electro-Charged]], [[Shattered]], and [[Swirl]]; though, the damage being multiplied can be much greater than the base damage of the other reactions.
* 1.5× reactions will tend to preserve the initial element for multiple hits, while 2× reactions will tend to immediately remove the initial element.<ref name="Gauge"/>

==Order of Application==
[[File:Triggering element (elemental reaction).png|thumb|Triggering element is displayed on the left, while the initial element is displayed on the right.]]

The damage of an Elemental Reaction scales off of the stats of the character who applies the trigger (second) element and is reduced by enemy elemental resistance. The triggering element will be displayed on the left of reaction animation over enemy's head, while the base element will be displayed on the right.

In the case of [[Swirl]] spreading an element to an elemental slime (e.g. a Pyro-infused swirl reaction hitting an Electro slime), the resulting damage scales based off the level and elemental mastery of the slime, not the Anemo character, though the swirl damage itself gets its scaling from the Anemo character.
