'''Normal Attack''' is the name of both a type of attack and a [[Talent]] for characters. Despite the shared name, "Normal Attack" typically refers to the type of attack rather than the Talent.

The Normal Attack Talent includes Normal Attacks, [[Charged Attack]]s, and [[Plunging Attack]]s. Each character comes with their Normal Attack [[Talent]] unlocked.

Normal Attacks as a type of attack are colloquially known as ''Auto Attack'' and are typically a series of 3–6 strikes. Despite the colloquial name, they are not executed automatically and require input via the Normal Attack [[keybind]] or button.

[[Catalyst]] characters deal {{Color|Black|Elemental DMG}} with all their attacks (Normal, Charged, and Plunging), while bow characters can only deal {{Color|Black|Elemental DMG}} with their Charged Attack.

All other characters deal {{Color|Physical DMG}}. Some Talents can change the {{Color|Physical DMG}} to {{Color|Black|Elemental DMG}} via [[elemental infusion]]s or [[conversion]]s.

==Charged Attacks==
{{Main|Charged Attack}}
'''Charged Attacks''' are performed by holding the Normal Attack button. These attacks are usually stronger, but take slightly longer to perform and typically consume [[Stamina]]. [[Bow]] characters are an exception; Stamina is not consumed in Aimed Shot mode and charging up an attack is only needed to make it deal [[Elemental]] Damage.

==Plunging Attacks==
{{Main|Plunging Attack}}
'''Plunging Attacks''' are performed by pressing the Normal Attack button while airborne. A standard jump on a generally flat surface typically does not give enough altitude to perform such an attack, so height support is needed to achieve this.

Using a Plunge Attack from a great altitude can drastically reduce or even negate the amount of [[Fall Damage]] taken. In certain circumstances, such as being knocked back by an enemy or being forced to walk off a ledge after going [[Out of Bounds]], Plunge Attacks cannot be used while falling.

==Trivia==
* Normal and Charged Attacks have an on-hit effect that differs across different attacks:
** For Sword and Polearm characters, there are 2 standard on-hit effects. They are chosen based on whether the attack has a slashing or stabbing motion:<!--
