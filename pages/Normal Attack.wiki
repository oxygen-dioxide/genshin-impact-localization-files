The '''Normal Attack''', colloquially known as ''Auto Attack'', is the main form of attack for [[Characters]]. Typically, this is a series of 3-6 strikes corresponding with the number of button presses. Each character has access to their Normal Attack [[Talent]] from the start.

[[Catalyst]] characters deal {{Color|Black|Elemental DMG}} with all their attacks (Normal, Charged, and Plunging), while bow characters can only deal {{Color|Black|Elemental DMG}} with their Charged Attack.

All other characters deal {{Color|Physical DMG}}. Some Talents can change the {{Color|Physical DMG}} to {{Color|Black|Elemental DMG}} via [[Elemental Infusion]].

==Charged Attacks==
{{Main|Charged Attack}}
'''Charged Attacks''' are performed by holding the Normal Attack button. These attacks are usually stronger, but take slightly longer to perform and typically consume [[Stamina]]. [[Bow]] characters are an exception; Stamina is not consumed in Aimed Shot mode and charging up an attack is only needed to make it deal [[Elemental]] Damage.

==Plunging Attacks==
{{Main|Plunging Attack}}
'''Plunging Attacks''' are performed by pressing the Normal Attack button while airborne. A standard jump on a generally flat surface typically does not give enough altitude to perform such an attack, so height support is needed to achieve this.

Using a Plunge Attack from a great altitude can drastically reduce or even negate the amount of [[Fall Damage]] taken. In certain circumstances, such as being knocked back by an enemy or being forced to walk off a ledge after going [[Out of Bounds]], Plunge Attacks cannot be used while falling.

==Trivia==
*Using any Normal Attack (normal, charged, plunging), except [[Barbara]], [[Mona]], and [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|Kokomi's]] normal and Charged Attacks on [[NPCs]], can cause them to flinch. Using them on certain [[wildlife]] like dogs will cause them to bark and run around the user in circles. Using them on cats will cause them to jump back and avoid the attack, sometimes causing them to do amusing air gymnastics.
