==Event Duration==
September 29, 2022 &mdash; October 7, 2022 23:59
* Rewards cannot be claimed after the event ends. Please claim them in time.

==Eligibility==
Travelers who have reached Adventure Rank 10 or above can participate in this event.

==Event Description==
During the event, you can roll the dice while wandering in the woods. Complete the corresponding adventure missions to obtain Primogems and other rewards.

==Gameplay Details==
# Each roll of the dice consumes one Dice Roll. Dice Rolls are earned by completing daily missions.
# Daily missions will be refreshed at 00:00. Additionally, unused Dice Rolls will be cleared by then. Please claim and use the Dice Rolls in time. (Claimed Dice Rolls will not be cleared).
# After each Dice Roll, the Traveler and Paimon will move based on the number of points from the roll.
# There are a variety of random events in the map, moving to the random event position can trigger the corresponding event, in which you can obtain Adventure Coins, Precious Dice, Dice Rolls, and other rewards.
# Some random events have multiple outcomes, with slightly different rewards for different outcomes.
# Some random event positions trigger interactive mini-games. The player has to perform specified actions to complete the event and receive the rewards.
* If you exit the interactive mini-game, the current position will not be saved.
* If Travelers enter the event at around 00:00 server time (when the daily missions refresh), there might be a brief network error. Please refresh your page if you encounter such a situation.
