{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kurai:''' I am the Jibashiri Kurai. Are you here to help solve the problem of these small orbs of thunder?
:{{DIcon}} What problem is that?
::'''Kurai:''' Ah, yes, when I went to Narukami Island to conduct an exchange previously, I used a secret technique to capture some strange objects.
::'''Kurai:''' I think the academic name for it is an Electro {{Not a Typo|Seele}}. Or something.
::'''Kurai:''' They fly all over the place, and numb all the people living here. It's quite vexing...
:{{DIcon}} What do you need solved?
::'''Kurai:''' Well, the issue of those Electro {{Not a Typo|Cells}}, of course.
::'''Kurai:''' Between you and me, I have no idea what to do with them.
::'''Kurai:''' Vishaps and villains, I can master, but these little gadgets are way beyond me.
::'''Kurai:''' How am I supposed to stop them from moving?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kurai:''' See you. If you know how, please help me solve this electric ball problem.
