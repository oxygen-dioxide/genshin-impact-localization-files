'''Amber Rocks''' are soft [[Geo Constructs]] found near [[Mt. Hulao]]. Breaking them can reveal a chest, some [[wildlife]], or an [[enemy]].

The rocks found along the mountain are formed by flowers [[Mountain Shaper]] planted to keep out intruders. These plants, called karst crawlers, are mostly hidden underground and will produce amber to trap anything that steps on it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moulder of Mountains}}</ref> Breaking the amber will reveal what was trapped inside &mdash; either treasure or enemies. Intruders trapped inside these amber rocks are unable to see, talk, move, or use magic.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: The Wonders of Adeptal Amber}}</ref>

There are exactly 10 large ambers that respawn every 12 hours.<ref name="amberchest" /> You can get a maximum of 10 common chests total from this and they will count towards the chest-opening achievement [[Rock-Steady Treasure Hunter]].
