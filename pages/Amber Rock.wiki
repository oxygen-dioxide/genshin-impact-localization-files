'''Amber Rocks''' are soft [[Geo Constructs]] found near [[Mt. Hulao]]. Breaking them can reveal a chest, some [[wildlife]], or an [[enemy]].

The rocks are actually plants called karst crawlers. The seeds were cultivated by [[Madame Ping|Streetward Rambler]], neither wilting or withering in its lifetime, though it is also implied to require tremendous upkeep.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Orioles Bask in Spring, the Heavens Present Auspices (Quest)}}</ref> The plants are mostly hidden underground and will produce amber to trap anything that steps on it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moulder of Mountains}}</ref> Breaking the amber will reveal what was trapped inside &mdash; either treasure or enemies. Intruders trapped inside these amber rocks are unable to see, talk, move, or use magic.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: The Wonders of Adeptal Amber}}</ref>

==Spawns==
This zone contains large pieces of amber much larger than [[Cor Lapis]]. Once destroyed, there is a chance that one of the following will appear:

There are exactly 10 large ambers that respawn every 12 hours.<ref name="amberchest" /> A maximum of 10 common chests total can be obtained from these and they will count towards the chest-opening achievement [[Rock-Steady Treasure Hunter]].
