'''Blacksmiths''' are shops that primarily provide [[forging]] services, and sell certain [[weapon]]s and [[Diagram|forging diagrams]]. The NPCs that head these shops also serve as one of the sources that can help with [[Mining Outcrop|mining outcrop]] search, being the source that can help mark the largest share of mining outcrops compared to any other NPCs.

==Shops==
The NPCs at these shops sell weapons of the [[2-Star Series]], and occasionally the [[1-Star Series]] as well. They also take commissions for forging [[Weapon Enhancement Material|weapon enhancement materials]], certain 4-Star weapons and certain [[gadget]]s.
