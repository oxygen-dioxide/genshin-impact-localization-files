{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Anand:''' Taking care of every ship going through the port is a must.
:{{cx}}
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Ore]] Veins Anand knows)
::'''Anand:''' Speaking of which, one of my employers told me today that there are some good ores nearby, even including those rare Magical Crystal Ores! They asked if I wanted to mine some for repair materials.
::'''Anand:''' Too bad. I can repair ships, but I didn't learn about mining ores, It's somewhere in this location. Go give it a try if you're interested.
:;(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Anand knows)
::'''Anand:''' Doesn't seem like there's anything special...
::'''Anand:''' The ships are sailing like normal, and the ocean surface is calm. It's a good day.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Anand:''' Hello. Did you get here on a ship?
::'''Anand:''' If the vessel needs maintenance, please come see me.
::'''Anand:''' I take care of every ship going through the port.
::{{DIcon}} Good job.
::'''Anand:''' It's part of what I do.
::'''Anand:''' The only concern I have is manpower shortage.
::'''Anand:''' The competition between caravans has caused many artisans like us to change line of work.
::'''Anand:''' But I won't leave, for my lover is a seafarer, so I understand how important ship safety is.
::'''Anand:''' I heard there's an agency called the [[Communications Office]] in [[Liyue]] that specializes in overseas shipping logistics.
::'''Anand:''' Don't you think that would solve the problem of cutthroat competition?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Anand:''' Yeah, see you.
