* Complete the [[Archon Quest]] "[[Ritou Escape Plan]]"
* To get the best experience from this event, complete [[Raiden Shogun]]'s [[Story Quest]]: "[[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter]]: Act II" first
** If the player has not completed Raiden Shogun's Story Quest: "Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter: Act II" during the event, they can enter the event through "Quick Start" in the event page.

===Summary===
* Complete the ''[[Unexpected Battle]]'' Event Quest to unlock the event.

===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Warriors Spirit 1.png
|text1  = Each of the warriors you will face has a different set of sword techniques, including ordinary techniques that they will use often and exceedingly powerful but less often used Ultimate Technique. You can {{Color|help|check your opponent's traits via the menu}} to better devise countermeasures and make it easier to emerge victorious.
|image2 = Tutorial Warriors Spirit 2.png
|text2  = You will be unable to use Elemental Skills or Bursts during these duels, but you will obtain new abilities: a Parry and Honed Techniques. When using Parry, you will raise your weapon in a defensive stance, greatly decreasing DMG taken. Parry is subject to a cooldown before it can be used again.
|image3 = Tutorial Warriors Spirit 3.png
|text3  = You will use different Honed Techniques to deal with different opponents. Hitting opponents with Normal and Charged Attacks, and performing Parries successfully will help you accumulate Spirit, which will also accumulate slowly over time. Once it finishes accumulating, you can actively use Honed Techniques. Up to 2 uses of such techniques can be accumulated.
|image4 = Tutorial Warriors Spirit 4.png
|text4  = If you get the timing right and Parry just as your opponent is striking, you can completely eliminate any DMG that would be done to you and will reset Parry's CD. Completing such a "Perfect Parry" against your opponent's normal techniques will cause you to accumulate more Spirit.
|image5 = Tutorial Warriors Spirit 5.png
|text5  = When each warrior is about to use their Ultimate Technique, their weapon will shine brightly. Perfectly Parry these techniques to unleash powerful counterattacks and accumulate large amounts of Spirit, then use your own Honed Techniques at the right moments to seize victory!
}}

==Gameplay Notes==
{{See also|Parry}}
* Honed Technique Spirit is accumulated in the following ways:
** '''+60%''' when Perfect Parrying an Ultimate Technique.
** '''+10%''' when Perfect Parrying other attacks.
** '''+1.5%''' when an attack hits the enemy.
** '''+1.5%''' per second passed.
