'''Bouncing Blobby Slimes''' is a [[Web Event]] in [[Version 2.7]].
==Event Duration==
2022/07/4 – 2022/07/10 23:59 (UTC+8)
* Rewards cannot be claimed after the event ends. Please claim them in time.

==Eligibility==
Travelers who have reached Adventure Rank 10 or above can participate in this event.

==Event Description==
During the event, Travelers can log in to Genshin Impact daily, complete Daily Commissions, and consume Original Resin to obtain Stamina for the Bouncing Adventure and claim the event item Blob Coin. You may use Blob Coins to exchange for Primogems and other event rewards.

==Obtaining Blob Coins==
Travelers can obtain Blob Coins in the Bouncing Adventure in the event.
*There is no cap on daily Blob Coin acquisition, and unused Blob Coins will not be removed.
*The amount of Blob Coins earned in a stage is equivalent to the score attained divided by 3. (rounded down)
**Hydro Slime adds extra 10% Blob Coins (rounded down as well.)

==Bouncing Adventure==
# A certain amount of Stamina is consumed for each Bouncing Adventure.<ref group="Note">Once you redeem all the rewards, Stamina is no longer consumed.</ref> Travelers can gain Stamina by completing specific missions.
#* Log in to the web event daily
#* Visit the official Genshin Impact Facebook page (one-time)
#* Visit the official Genshin Impact Twitter page (one-time)
#* Visit the official HoYoLAB website (one-time)
#* Visit the official Genshin Impact website (one-time)
#* Log in to Genshin Impact daily (0/1)
#* Complete 2 Daily Commissions daily (0/2)
#* Use 40 Original Resin daily (0/40)
# Travelers can gain a certain amount of Stamina each day by completing relevant in-game actions and web event actions, such as: logging into Genshin Impact every day, completing two Daily Commissions every day, consuming 40 Original Resin every day, and logging into the web event every day.
# Daily missions refresh at 04:00 (Server Time) each day. Unclaimed Stamina will also be cleared by then. Please claim and use the Stamina in time. Claimed Stamina will not be cleared.
# In Bouncing Adventure, Travelers need to help the Slime move to the specific location through charged bounces. Reaching the specific location is considered as a successful challenge.
# Blob Coins can be obtained in each Bouncing Adventure. The higher the score is, the more Blob Coins are obtained.
# There are 8 Levels in the Bouncing Adventure. Travelers can also unlock specific levels in advance by successfully challenging particular levels.
# In each Bouncing Adventure Level, there is 1 chance of Revival that revives the Slime without consuming Stamina or Blob Coins.
* Quitting mid-adventure will trigger Score Calculation. If the score of the current level exceeds your best score, it will be saved as your high score. The obtained Blob Coins will be added to your inventory. The Stamina already consumed will not be returned to you.
* For more information, please check "Gameplay Details."
* If Travelers start the Bouncing Adventure around 04:00, which is when the Daily Missions and Stamina refresh, there might be a brief network error. Please refresh your page if you encounter such a situation.

==Unlocking Slimes==
# In the Bouncing Adventure, there are 7 Slimes to choose from. Each Slime has its own skill to aid you during the adventure and attain more Blob Coins.
# Travelers can unlock the various Slimes by challenging different Levels.
# Some new Slimes are available for trial usage in certain levels and can also be unlocked. During the trial, you can only use this Slime in a specific level. Once unlocked, you can use it in all levels as well as the "Infinite Bouncing" mode. It will also interact with you from the home page.
# Use any Slime to complete specific Levels successfully to unlock the trial Slime in those Levels.

==Slime Abilities==
* [[File:Bouncing Blobby Slimes Slime Hydro.png|40px]] Hydro Slime: +10% Blob Coins earned
* [[File:Bouncing Blobby Slimes Slime Anemo.png|40px]] Anemo Slime: faster jump charging, but if crosshair reaches its furthest position, the Anemo Slime flies up, and players must re-aim after it comes down
* [[File:Bouncing Blobby Slimes Slime Pyro.png|40px]] Pyro Slime: burns down thorns if landed on
* [[File:Bouncing Blobby Slimes Slime Cryo.png|40px]] Cryo Slime: prevents slipping on water stains by freezing them
* [[File:Bouncing Blobby Slimes Slime Geo.png|40px]] Geo Slime: prevents stones with cracks from crumbling
* [[File:Bouncing Blobby Slimes Slime Electro.png|40px]] Electro Slime: lights up dark areas
* [[File:Bouncing Blobby Slimes Slime Dendro.png|40px]] Dendro Slime: colors the aiming crosshair green when it points at the Perfect Jump area
** This accounts for the "air time" of the slime, so the places where the crosshair turns green are Perfect Jump areas even for moving platforms.

==Infinite Bouncing==
# Complete all 8 Levels in the Bouncing Adventure to unlock "Infinite Bouncing" Mode.
# In Infinite Bouncing Mode, mechanisms become random in nature and infinite in number.
# Travelers can spend Blob Coins reviving the Slime up to 3 times in a run, each time costing 1, 3, and 5 Blob Coin(s) in respective.
# In this mode, a maximum of 400 Blob Coins can be obtained for each run.

==Event Rewards==
Travelers can exchange the corresponding number of Blob Coins for Primogems, Hero's Wit, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and other rewards in Blob Store.
# Rewards in the Blob Store are divided into multiple tiers. Travelers need to exchange for all the rewards in the current tier before the next tier unlocks.
# Exchange for all rewards to unlock Unlimited Play Mode. In this mode, playing Bouncing Adventure Levels or Infinite Bouncing Mode no longer requires Stamina and it does not reward Blob Coins. New records created can still be reflected in High Score.
* Rewards need to be collected manually. Rewards cannot be claimed after the event ends. Please claim them in time.
* The in-game rewards will be distributed via in-game mail. The mail will expire after 30 days, so don't forget to claim the rewards in time.
* This web event is provided purely for entertainment. It is not indicative of any related gameplay features in Genshin Impact.

==Gameplay Details==
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Bouncing Blobby Slimes 1.png
|text1  = Hold the left mouse button or space bar to charge, and release to jump.<br />The longer you hold, the farther you jump.<br />The location indicated by the crosshair is where you will land.
|image2 = Tutorial Bouncing Blobby Slimes 2.png
|text2  = Land at the center of the stone to perform a Perfect Jump, landing on this area will earn you more points!
When the crosshair reaches its furthest position, it will return to its initial position at a constant speed. This will keep repeating until the slime jumps.
|image3 = Tutorial Bouncing Blobby Slimes 3.png
|text3  = The score of each jump will add up to the level's total score.<br />The higher the level's score, the more Blob Coins you'll obtain when the final score is calculated.<br />Once the progress bar is full, the current level challenge is complete.
|image4 = Tutorial Bouncing Blobby Slimes 4.png
|text4  = If the slime accidentally lands on the spikes on the thorny stones, the jump will fail and score calculation will automatically be triggered.
|image5 = Tutorial Bouncing Blobby Slimes 5.png
|text5  = If the slime doesn't make a Perfect Jump onto the water stains on the water-stained stone mechanism, you will only get 80% of the points for this jump.
|image6 = Tutorial Bouncing Blobby Slimes 6.png
|text6  = If you stay on a stone with cracks for more than 3 seconds, it will crumble... The slime will fall once the stone crumbles. This will be deemed as a failed jump and score calculation will automatically be triggered.

==Blob Store==
Note: All parts from the previous tier must be exchanged before the next tier is unlocked.

==Trivia==
* The title of Stage III, "No One Escapes My Sights!", is also one of [[Amber's Elemental Burst]] voice-overs.
* The title of Stage IV, "Thorn... to Oblivion," is a play on one of [[Raiden Shogun's Elemental Burst]] voice-overs.
* The title of Stage VI, "I'm Always Watching," is also one of [[Yae Miko's Elemental Burst]] voice-overs.
* On the event's home screen, the slimes will perform an idle animation at certain time intervals or when clicked/tapped on.
* The minimum jump distance is insignificant. As such, slimes may land on the same rock they are sitting on if the distance is not far enough. If this happens, there are no changes to the score or Blob Coins earned, and the slime's next jump will begin from their new position.
