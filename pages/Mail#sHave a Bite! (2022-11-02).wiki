| text = The other day, I left for a trip to a distant land. In the rainforest southwest of [[Minlin]], I found a [[Forest Boar]] with [[Mushroom|mushrooms]] on its back. Hehe, I captured it, and that's what we call "two ingredients with one stone"! Seeing how the combination of [[Raw Meat|meat]] and fungi could play up the freshness, my mind was immediately filled with so many cooking recipes and spice choices! Sauté, deep-fry, stir-fry, stew... Aw, my stomach was growling at the thought! In the end, Guoba and I managed to find a pot nearby and enjoyed a big meal.

I saved quite some ingredients. So, would you like to give my new dish a try? You know how good I am, hehe, and there's also a new method that I just came up with. Wait to be surprised!

Ah, why don't I give you a riddle to work on? You can also share it with friends for fun later.

"A pile of dirt when seen from afar, a group of fungi that grows not on trees, and a lawn that walks alone. What am I? A [[Shroomboar]]!"
