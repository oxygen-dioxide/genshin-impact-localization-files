|description    = A medal and trophy awarded to the [[Traveler|Honorary Senior Researcher]] of the [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering]], these represent the Fontaine Research Institute's high degree of recognition of the Traveler's contributions. The commendation's writing style is rather distinct, and has the characteristic rigor of the Fontaine Research Institute. It is clear that as time passes, the New Fontaine Research Institute, which upholds the same strict standards for procedures and documentation, will be back on the "right track," just like the previous Fontaine Research Institute.
