==Summary==
Meeting up with [[Arapacati]], she tasks them with finding her lost brothers who were out across the forest. The Traveler finds the four brothers, [[Arachatora]], [[Arapas]], [[Arasaka]] and [[Araphala]] and help them in their cooking, although they find nothing special with their dishes. When they return back to Vanarana, Arapacati scolds them. She proceeds to explain to the Traveler that while they're not actually related, when the [[Traveler's Sibling|Nara Varuna]] visited them, they taught them how humans ate, sparking their interest in cooking. She asks them to help them prepare human food during the festival, since they wouldn't understand it.
