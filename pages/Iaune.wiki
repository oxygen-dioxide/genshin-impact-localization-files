{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Iaune:''' What *is* the meaning of work, really...
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
::'''Iaune:''' Hello! I'll get the materials needed today right away&mdash; Oh, it's you!
::'''Iaune:''' We meet again, Traveler. It's my pleasure.
::'''Iaune:''' And no, that's not mere formality. Seeing you is like seeing a gear turning on an intricate axis within a clock &mdash; it's as if my life is still on the right track.
::{{DIcon}} Still feeling the pressure?
::'''Iaune:''' Well... yeah.
::'''Iaune:''' I'm not ashamed to admit that. It just means that I'm "taking every problem too seriously"!
::'''Iaune:''' That's what [[Roialte]] and [[Semaine]] always tell me, anyway.
::'''Iaune:''' But I still don't believe that being serious is a bad thing. That's why I've expanded the document workload here by three times, I suppose.
::'''Iaune:''' But don't worry too much about me. I'll do my best to finish my work. You go about your day too, alright?
:{{DIcon}} Don't think too hard about stuff, alright?
::'''Iaune:''' ...You're right. I have to put my past frustrations behind me and just take the useful experience on.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Iaune:''' Time to plan a camping trip... Fishing, or mountain climbing? Should I ask [[Estelle]] to come along?
:{{DIcon}} Planning a vacation, are we?
::'''Iaune:''' That might be a bit of an overstatement. I'm just considering what to do on an off day.
::'''Iaune:''' I'm currently trying to avoid thinking about work when not at work... Emphasis on "trying."
::{{DIcon|Reward}} That's a pretty good idea, actually.
::'''Iaune:''' Yes. But walking the walk isn't as easy as talking the talk...
::'''Iaune:''' Thank you so much for your help. Please accept these humble gifts that I caught myself.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fish|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Have fun.
::'''Iaune:''' Thank you!
