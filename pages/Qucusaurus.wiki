==Descriptions==
{{Description|A Saurian with large, supple wings that can glide through the air for long periods.<br>It is said that the ancestors of the Qucusaurs were the closest in form to the mighty winged dragons, and that they could soar through the sky like clouds. According to the storytellers, when the greatest of such dragons spread its wings, the entire sky would be blotted out. Of course, the Qucusaurs we see today no longer possess such forms, but the claws they hide within their downy feather coats remain as sharp as ever.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* The name Qucusaurus derives from the Mayan God "''Qʼuqʼumatz''", whose name translates literally to "quetzal serpent" or loosely as "feathered serpent". The latter part derives from the Greek word "''saurus''", meaning ''lizard''.  Combined, Qucusaurus translates loosely to "Feathered Lizard". 
* It is also possible the name "Qucu" is a stylized form of "cuckoo", a bird known for laying eggs in other birds’ nests to raise their young.
* Some Qucusaurs, especially around [[Ochkanatlan]], [[Skyfire Circlet]] and the [[Ancient Sacred Mountain]] can be seen flying in a set pattern. Other Qucusaurs can be seen wandering around a very limited area.
** Qucusaurs that fly in a set pattern are attackable, though combat is not initiated and the Qucusaur will simply ignore the player upon taking damage. They can still be killed and award experience and materials, but these will drop all the way to the ground or water.
** Qucusaurs that fly in a very limited area are not attackable in their flying state. These Qucusaurs will drop to the ground and initiate combat upon being approached as another Qucusaur in the air or by walking underneath them.
