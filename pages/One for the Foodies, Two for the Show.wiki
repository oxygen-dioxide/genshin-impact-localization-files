<h3>Wanmin Restaurant</h3>
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon logging in or approaching Wanmin Restaurant)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, this is starting to feel like chili pepper weather. Mmm, Paimon's hungry for some fresh and fiery spicy food that let your taste buds have a blast!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And if there's one dish that fits the bill, it's [[Black-Back Perch Stew]]! C'mon, (Traveler), let's pay a visit to [[Wanmin Restaurant]]!

;(Approach Wanmin Restaurant)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, guess who's here~!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, no way! It's the Traveler, and Paimon!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 01.ogg}} '''[[Chef Mao]]:''' Ah, Traveler, welcome! Good to see you. What can I get for you?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We want some Black-Back Perch Stew!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 02.ogg}} '''Chef Mao:''' Alright, Black-Back Perch Stew it is! Make yourselves at home, it'll be right out for you in just a moment.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, Chef Mao!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I was just thinking about you guys, and now you're here! It feels like you heard my call and came running, tee-hee.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean, you were about to come looking for us?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Uh-huh, there's something I wanna discuss with you guys. Did you happen to see how the city looked on the way over here? Everyone's getting ready for the [[Moonchase Festival]]!
:{{DIcon}} Oh, so that's what it's called.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Moonchase Festival? Is that another one of [[Liyue]]'s ancient traditions?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' That's right! Moonchase is a big festival where we celebrate the arrival of the fall by moonlight. The old folks say that thousands of years ago, this was the time of year when the adepti would seek the Way.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' But it's completely different nowadays. We eat our favorite foods, spend time with friends and relatives, enjoy the moon and the flowers... so much easier. Basically, we just do all the things that people like doing and don't take a whole lot of effort.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like Paimon's kind of festival!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' *chuckle* With your great taste in food, Moonchase Festival is sure to be to your liking!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon has taste...?
:{{DIcon}} Let's agree to disagree.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! If you've got a problem with Paimon's taste, just spit it out!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Um, so are you guys free these days? I'm taking part in this year's Masterful Chefs. If possible, I'd like you to be my culinary consultants!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 03.ogg}} '''Chef Mao:''' That's right! Getting some suggestions from friends will broaden your horizons!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Masterful Chefs, huh? So is that, like, a competition?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh right, yeah, I guess you probably haven't heard about it before.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Every year, Moonchase Festival has a different theme &mdash; usually picked by the [[Liyue Qixing|Qixing]]. This year's theme is Feast of the Bounteous Land, so the Qixing decided to organize a cooking competition.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Feast of the Bounteous Land... pretty much sums up what Liyue's all about. Great theme!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I totally agree! I heard it was [[Ningguang]] that came up with it. She's so amazing... and so full of mystery.
:{{DIcon}} So, what do you need us to do?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Well, I wanna take part in the competition, but coming up with new dishes is hard work. By the time you've finally thought of something, cooked it, taste-tested it... it can be hard to judge whether you're really onto something or not.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 12.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' So I was thinking I could get the two of you to help by gathering everyone's thoughts on what makes a great dish! I really want to think outside the box this time, and to do that I'm gonna need lots of different ideas from lots of different people.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This'll be a piece of cake! We've got friends from all over the map, haven't we, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} We certainly don't lack contacts.
:{{DIcon}} Can't help being popular.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 13.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee, you sound pretty confident!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, y'know, not to brag or anything...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But first things first, let's have a delicious Wanmin meal... After that, we can go around all our friends in Liyue and get their ideas one by one.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 14.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Okay, great! Also, [[Guoba]] should be back soon, so we can all go together!
;(Scene change{{colon}} Everyone moves to a table)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 04.ogg}} '''Chef Mao:''' Here's your Black-Back Perch Stew, folks!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mmm! It smells so good!
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Chef Mao.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 05.ogg}} '''Chef Mao:''' Haha, it's my pleasure.

:'''After having a delicious meal...'''

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mmm... That was so delicious! Theory confirmed, this is definitely chili pepper weather!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 06.ogg}} '''Chef Mao:''' Xiangling can be a bit of a handful, so please look out for her while you're out and about.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 15.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' C'mon Dad! Why would you say that!?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 chefmao 07.ogg}} '''Chef Mao:''' Because I know you all too well, my dear, that's why. You mustn't be quite so reckless when you're out in the wild, you understand? You'd do well to be a little more cautious, like our Traveler friend.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we're all friends here. Let's all look out for each other!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 xiangling 16.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Ah! And Guoba's back! Roly-polying around, as usual.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's pack up and head out!
----
;(Approach Hu Tao)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So it's outside-the-box thinking that we're looking for, right? [[Hu Tao]] always seems to have a unique perspective, so let's make this our first stop!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' What what what? My ears are burning... did somebody say my name?
:{{Introductory Note|character=Hu Tao}}
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Aiya, it's Paimon and the Traveler! And Xiangling too!
:{{DIcon}} We've come to hang out!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Of course, Hu Tao! Way, way outside the box!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Meaning... you're here for some other reason, right? How might I be of assistance?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Well, Hu Tao, I wanted to ask you: What kind of food do you like?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' What food I like? Hmm... off the top of my head, I don't really have an answer.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, so even Hu Tao gets lost for words sometimes. Paimon sure didn't see that coming.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Come on, even the chirpiest birds clock out for the night, right? I'm no different.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pretty sure "clocking out" isn't something birds do, but okay...
:{{DIcon}} It's okay, Hu Tao, just keep it simple.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Right! There's no need to over complicate it, just pick a dish and tell me what you like about it! I'm doing some market research.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I see, I see! Launching a new dish? Well, let me say right off the bat &mdash; nothing weird, okay! Some poached fish, a side of shrimp dumplings, that's all you need!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Poached fish and shrimp dumplings? That's a bit ordinary, isn't it?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Well, it is and it isn't. Think about it, poached fish is hot and spicy with a powerful aroma. It's a "dynamic" dish. Add a side of shrimp dumplings, and there's your "static" component. Got it?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Dynamic...?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, oh.... I&mdash;I can do dynamic! Mushroom Slime Stew&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Not that kind of dynamic! A dish is more than substance, it's a mood. Poached fish is red and spicy. It elicits a response from the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. That's why I call it "dynamic."
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Shrimp dumplings are more subdued &mdash; clear and smooth with a pure and subtle fragrance. I call that "static." Combining dynamic and static is how you create a perfectly balanced meal, a union between opposite but complementary features co-existing in perfect harmony!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't follow that at all... but at the same time, it kinda sounded smart, so...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Okay... dynamic and static, opposite but complementary...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, is this just another way of saying you should keep everything balanced? Y'know, a little meat, a little veggie? A little salt, a little sugar?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 10.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Bingo! Except, I don't think you need to have a sweet dish for it to be a complete meal. Personally, I always skip dessert.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Okay, I think I got it! At first, I thought you were just goofing around, but actually you make a really good point!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee, how did I ever doubt you, Hu Tao! Thanks!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When it comes to telling tales, the storytellers have got nothing on Hu Tao.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 11.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hmm? Sounds suspiciously like a compliment to me. I'll take it!
:{{DIcon}} You're clearly a keen philosopher.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 12.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Aha! Well, at least one of you gets it!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 13.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Everything in this world runs on its own set of principles, be it the circle of life or sugar and spice! You either get it or you don't.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Since the Traveler seems to approve, I'll make sure to factor it in.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks we're pretty much done here now. Let's head to [[Bubu Pharmacy]] next.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 3 hutao 14.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Bubu Pharmacy... Yeah, you'll definitely get some interesting responses over there. Hehehe...

;(Talk to Hu Tao again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' If you find out anything interesting, you gotta come back and tell me about it!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Bubu Pharmacy===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Qiqi or Baizhu)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 01.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Oh, it's you. Is everything okay?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Why, if it isn't the special guests who seldom visit. Less busy than usual, I see.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes, wh&mdash;what happened to [[Baizhu]]'s voice!?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 02.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Sss! Excuse me! The neck!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... it's just [[Changsheng]]...
:{{DIcon}} It's been a while.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Haha, welcome, welcome. Here to procure an herbal remedy, I presume?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No no, we actually came for the conversation this time. We're here to talk food!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I'm entering this year's cooking competition, so I wanted to ask you both... wait, there's three of you! I wanted to ask the three of you about what kind of food you like.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 03.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Hahaha, most astutely self-corrected. We shall surely supply our assistance.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 02.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' You need to know... what food I like? Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 03.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' It's all the same. No flavor.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' [[Qiqi]] has some gustatory dysfunction and can't taste any food. Make no mistake, she's not being uncooperative.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, I understand, that's fine! Still, I'd expect Qiqi to have some sort of dietary preferences, though. There must be some dishes that you like the sensation of?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 04.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Sensation? Hmm... Yes. There's one.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 05.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Coconut milk... Nice and cold...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well that doesn't help us. It's not a dish, it's a drink...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' How about you two? Any thoughts?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 04.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' I like bite-sized morsels of meat.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I agree with Changsheng.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Many of our patients are the elderly and young children. They find large chunks of Fowl or seafood difficult to swallow and digest. Dishes where the ingredients have been finely chopped, on the other hand, are far more suitable for them.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 05.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' We also see plenty of people with colds and sore throats who find it difficult to eat rich food... From a purely pharmaceutical perspective, I tend to recommend soups and stews.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Got it. Would that be medicinal soups and stews?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 06.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Whew, medicinal soup... I don't like it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 06.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I must apologize for having such a one-track mind... It's a little difficult to think about food without worrying about the health implications these days. We've had quite the endless stream of patients recently... If you ask me, I think the changing weather is to blame.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's okay, everyone's input counts. Keeping it seasonal and suitable for all ages sounds like a pretty good idea to Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Important considerations for any chef.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Medicinal dishes have higher demands in terms of nutritional balance than the kind of food I normally cook. I don't usually focus on medicinal properties, but since this is for a competition... maybe I can score more points by taking both flavor and function into account.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 07.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Food with substance, always better. Everyone will like it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' It's a great suggestion! Thanks everyone!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 qiqi 08.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' You're welcome. As long as we could help.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' It's great to have a doctor's unique perspective. I'm feeling inspired!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 baizhu 07.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Oh, how you flatter me.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 changsheng 05.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Receptivity to sensible suggestions makes for a savvy chef.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, she is! Creating new dishes is Xiangling's favorite thing to do, you can be sure she'll put lots of care and attention into it!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee... Everyone's got their hobbies, and mine is cooking! Usually, I just go with my own ideas, but having a whole new perspective this time is sure to make a big difference to the end result.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! That makes this whole trip worth it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, time to move on to the next! So we've got an independent thinker's perspective and a health perspective... Next, Paimon thinks we should probably talk to some picky eaters.

;(Talk to Qiqi again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 qiqi 01.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Coconut milk... Now I want coconut milk.

;(Talk to Baizhu again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Food and medicine are inextricably intertwined, you know. To give a full account of all the ways in which they are connected, why, I'd have to start that story from a long, long way back...
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 changsheng 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Shhhh! Nobody was asking!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Yujing Terrace===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach [[Beidou]], [[Keqing]], and [[Ningguang]])
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm? Oh, it's the Traveler and Paimon... and Xiangling.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Greetings, friends. It's been a while.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hey! What brings you here?
:{{DIcon}} Huh? Everyone's gathered together here...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Has something happened?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's with this great big stone on the ground?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Long story... So, just to confirm, I will assume responsibility for handling this stone of unknown origin. Any objections?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' None here. You know how to get things done, Keqing. As long as it's with you, I can rest easy knowing that it's in safe hands.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Should I take this to mean that you doubt the relative safety of leaving this in the hands of the Tianquan?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Huh? Well, for starters, Keqing is the one who's always out running errands, rain or shine. Besides, you don't seem to give a wooden Mora about this whole thing anyway, so what's it to you!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I was merely joking. You, meanwhile, seem only too ready to pounce when an opportunity to publicly lambaste me arises, even when it means giving our poor mutual friend here the cold shoulder.
:{{DIcon}} Uh... Is this a bad time?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' By no means. You wish to know about the stone, I presume? Then let me invite the great seafarer, Captain Beidou, to tell the story &mdash; if she would be so kind.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' You... Ugh, fine...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Well... It's a big one, right? And such a smooth surface, too. Makes you think there's gotta be a good chunk of jade in there.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It was found by a fishing crew not far off the coast. It must have been underwater for years, so the erosion will be what's given it that smooth finish.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Finds like this cannot be kept as private property, and must be submitted to a holder of public office. Placing it into our custody will also give them peace of mind.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' So, what's inside it?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Well, we've hit it with just about every weapon we could get our hands on and haven't managed to even dent it yet. Clearly, there's more to it than meets the eye.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No weapon could smash it open? Wow... Paimon doesn't think we've ever encountered a stone like that before...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Keqing has taken an unusually keen interest in this giant stone, which is why we are leaving the matter in her capable hands.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Let's put that aside for a second. Traveler, what brings you here? Were you looking for someone?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, we were looking for all of you! We need all hands on deck here!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Oh? Hopefully not because there's been some sort of cataclysmic event?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' No no, nothing like that! Paimon's just getting carried away... I just wanted to ask everyone about their food preferences.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' ...Food preferences? That's a little unexpected.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 08.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I have rather simple tastes. Precise, pure, smart, and sophisticated. That is all I require.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' That's your idea of simple, huh?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 ningguang 09.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I summed up my culinary requirements in four words. Is that insufficiently simple for you?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' A few weeks out on the open ocean would fix your flawed definition of simplicity, let me tell you that.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' What about you, Beidou?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Me? Uh... if it's freshly cooked and piping hot, that floats my boat. If it's got a little chili pepper in there too, I'm one very happy Captain.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thought you would've said bar food.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hahaha, oh, bar food works too!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' As for me... it's got to be seafood.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Okay, got it! So, seafood, piping hot, and, uh, simple-but-sophisticated...
:{{DIcon}} Not a lot of overlap...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' That's where I would disagree! Traveler, surely you've heard of [[Golden Shrimp Balls]]?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (*gasp* Oh my... they're my favorite...)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' You need to wash and de-vein the shrimp, wrap it in finely sliced potato strips, then deep fry it to perfection. There's no room for cutting corners!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' They're very precisely put together, they taste pure, the presentation is smart, and the skill needed to cook them is highly sophisticated... It fits Ningguang's four-word summary to the letter!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so what you're saying is... for all the frills and trills, good food is all the same at the core?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I heartily agree. Golden Shrimp Balls are a prime example. Their essence lies in combining art and nutrition in a single package. It is a dish of true value.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Okay, got it &mdash; so, Keqing loves Golden Shrimp Balls...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I&mdash;I didn't say that! ...Did I?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 beidou 10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hahaha, no, at least not outright.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Alrighty! Thanks for all of your input! I'll be sure to take it all into consideration!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Traveler, Paimon, do you have anything planned after this?
:{{DIcon}} No immediate plans.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Good. I'd like you to help me investigate something. It's about this stone...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You picked the right people for the job. We investigate stuff all the time!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' My thoughts exactly. The Qixing has a public duty to deliver our final verdict to the fisherman, but there are also some things I would like to investigate on a personal level.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'm sure you've become acquainted with the general background of the Moonchase Festival. However, I have my own understanding of this festival's roots.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 15.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' My grandfather was a researcher of Liyue's traditions. In his notes, he indicated that there was a deity called the [[Stove God]] in ancient Liyue which people paid tribute to at a certain time of the year.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 16.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Very few written records make mention of the Stove God, and those that do are notoriously confusing. Some scholars believe that the Stove God was just another title held by the [[Rex Lapis|Lord of Geo]], but others suggest that this was a different deity altogether...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 17.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' One folktale even claims that the ancients found the Stove God's shrine, but there was no statue &mdash; only a huge, smooth slab of stone.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 18.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Shortly after it was found, the stone was lost in transit, and it hasn't been seen since. This stone here has all the same features, so I suspect it could be the one that went missing all those years ago.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 19.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' After many years of researching ancient texts, my grandfather came to believe that the practice of paying seasonal tribute to the Stove God may be best described as a festival &mdash; he called it the Stove God Festival. That would make it the forerunner to the Moonchase Festival we know today.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 20.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' But this is all just theory and conjecture. To prove any of it, we'd need to start by identifying who the Stove God really was.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 21.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Now that Rex Lapis has passed on and Liyue has entered the age of humankind, his successors should continue to respect our nation's culture and traditions, just as he did.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 22.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' That's why I think the responsibility for this situation should fall to me. It's a chance to shed light on our history, revitalize an ancient tradition, and possibly prove my grandfather's hypothesis along the way. With any luck, we'll nail all three in one fell swoop.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 23.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It was just a couple of days ago that we received this stone &mdash; right after we decided to use food as the central theme for this year's festival. It makes me wonder... maybe a divine will is at work behind all of this.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Three birds with one stone, huh? That's pretty efficient &mdash; even for Keqing!
:{{DIcon}} I'd love to help, but...
::{{DIcon}} I'm in the middle of a commission for Xiangling...<!-- consecutive dialogue -->
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hey, don't worry about that. This sounds super important, so don't mind me.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 12.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Besides, we were only... Hmm? Wait a second... I got it!!!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 24.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Wh&mdash;What? Why are you shouting?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 13.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Keqing, can I tag along for your investigation?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 25.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Huh? But...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 14.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Since it's all about the Stove God, I might get to learn something useful about cooking along the way. It'll be great inspiration for me in the competition!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 15.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Please? Lemme come along. I promise I'll help!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 26.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If it means that much to you... Okay, I suppose you can come.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 xiangling 16.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Really!? Yay, thank you so much! You're the best!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 keqing 27.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ahem! Now that that's settled... Time to get going. [[Qingce Village]] is said to be home to a lot of historical texts, so I'd like to start by making some inquiries there.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, then it's off to Qingce we go!

;(Talk to Ningguang or Beidou again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Sincerely, Beidou, you misunderstand me. I have many simple pleasures &mdash; I take a stroll through Yujing Terrace and one down by the harbor every single day.

;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi granny, we need your help with something!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are there any old books around in Qingce Village? You know, from a really long time ago.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 6 grannyruoxin 01.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' Oh, looking for ancient texts, are we? Let me think...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 6 grannyruoxin 02.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' There is an old warehouse over there, property of the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]]. Many books are stored inside &mdash; those that they have no room for at home. In fact, their youngest comes over this way to read sometimes.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 6 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The Feiyun Commerce Guild's youngest? You must be talking about [[Xingqiu]].
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon didn't know they had a warehouse here. Let's go take a look!

;(Approach the warehouse)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 6 sheng 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Help! I'm being robbed!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 6 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm? It came from that direction. Come on!

;(Talk to Sheng after defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 8 sheng 01.ogg}} '''Sheng:''' Ugh... I've come here to clean the book warehouse plenty of times before, but this is the first time I've run into these crooks...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Are you alright?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 01.ogg}} '''Sheng:''' I am, thanks to all of you. Hey, wait a minute &mdash; you're the Traveler, aren't you? And you're with... Lady Keqing! An honor, truly an honor!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' We'll try not to take up too much of your time. I understand that this book warehouse is the property of the Feiyun Commerce Guild? Could you advise whether we might find any texts relating to the Stove God in this collection?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 02.ogg}} '''Sheng:''' The Stove God? Uh... I heard that's the Lord of Geo, right?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Really?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 03.ogg}} '''Sheng:''' Yeah, a friend of mine who conducts research mentioned it once before. We use stoves for cooking, and stoves are built from rock.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 04.ogg}} '''Sheng:''' Some people think that the stove is a gift from the Lord of Geo, and that's why they call him the Stove God.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Seems logical enough...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' But do you have any books on the topic?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 sheng 05.ogg}} '''Sheng:''' Um... I, uh... I'm sorry, I'd have to ask the young master about that...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Any questions? Please, ask away!

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, it's [[Chongyun]] and Xingqiu!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hello, one and all.
:{{Introductory Note|character=Chongyun|guaranteed=yes}}
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hey guys, what are you doing here?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I was bored with nothing to do and thought I'd come out this way for a bit of reading. And then I thought, why not bring Chongyun along, too.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yes, I'm just along for the ride really...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I see the Yuheng, Keqing, is with you. Whatever brings you here must surely be a matter of grave importance.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Master Xingqiu, if I may be so bold &mdash; do you happen to know if there are any texts on the subject of the Stove God among this collection?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Since I personally selected which volumes to store here, I do have some recollection of their contents.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' If my memory betrays me not, there is one volume among them called "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue," which mentions the Stove God.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Might I take a look?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Certainly. If it pleases my lady, I shall lead the way. Sheng, I will take care of things here. You're free to go about your own business.

:'''Xingqiu and Keqing go to the book collection to check some ancient texts...'''

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They're back! So, did you find it?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes. Master Xingqiu has quite an exceptional memory, "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue" does indeed mention the Stove God. However...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It says the following: "The body of the dragon wielded a tail that could eclipse the sun, and claws to command fire and teach the ways of wisdom. Receiving the gift bequeathed unto them, humankind cooked food with fire, and thus did they prosper."
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' The body of a dragon? The stories about Rex Lapis say the same thing.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' That much is true. But this is the only passage in the whole book. If we want to find out more, we'll have to continue our investigation.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' There's nothing further to discover here. It seems we'll have to look at other options.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I come from a long lineage of exorcists, and our family too has amassed a number of ancient texts. Now that you mention the Stove God, I seem to recall reading somewhere that this god once appeared at the [[Guili Assembly]]. Of course, I can't say if it's true or not.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Books are penned by people. All they can do is show what the author was thinking. Everyone's mind is different, so every book on a given topic will give a different account.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I apologize that we could not help in a more substantial capacity.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Your help thus far is quite ample. Liyue is a vast and rich land, all things that existed here in the past have left their trace. So long as we do not abandon our search, it is sure to bear fruit eventually.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Thank you all. We will continue our investigation elsewhere.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Ah, hold up! I had a question too! Xingqiu, Chongyun, could you tell me what kind of food you like?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Food? Oh no... Y&mdash;You're not thinking of taking part in Masterful Chefs, are you!?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Uh, yeah, I totally am! What's wrong... You look like you've just seen a ghost!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Xiangling, this is a major event. I beg you, please don't cook anything strange for this competition...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' What do you mean, "strange"!?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Mushroom Slime Stew, to give one example.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Okay, fair enough, that dish isn't my most popular... but that's why I'm doing all this research, so I can create some really special dishes to win everyone over.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Well, in that case... I like cold food.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's 'cause you can't handle hot and spicy, right?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Haha, yes, you're absolutely right.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' My tastes are on the mild side &mdash; I prefer gentle dishes with minimal seasoning. Soups and stews, vegetables in broth, seafood or freshwater fish, either boiled or steamed... These kinds of dishes I am most partial to.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No surprises from Guhua Geek.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Okay, another mild child... Got it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' These are just personal preferences, and everyone's are quite different... Are you sure this eclectic mix of opinions will be of any use?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Of course! You're my customers, and putting a smile on customers' faces is my calling as a chef!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 11.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Though Xiangling's market research blade stabs often into the dark, her heart never strays from the noble path.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If anyone can win hearts and minds with their cooking, it's gotta be someone like Xiangling. She's got pure intentions and really cares about the customers.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Where's all this praise coming from...? Knock it off guys, you're embarrassing me...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Ah! Sorry for holding you all up &mdash; that's all I needed to know! Shall we carry on with the investigation now?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Over to you, Keqing. Where to next?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' So we've learned the Stove God allegedly made an appearance at the Guili Assembly. But today, that place is largely a wasteland, with few traces of human activity.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' [[Wangshu Inn]] is close by, so let's stop off there on the way over and see what we can find out.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 xingqiu 12.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Forgive us, for this is where we must part ways. May your journey be a smooth one.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yes, best of luck! If you run into any difficulties, come and find us. We'll be only too glad to help!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks everyone.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go! Next stop, Wangshu Inn!

;(Talk to Chongyun or Xingqiu again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Now, which book to read today? Aha, how about this &mdash; Chongyun, pick a book, any book, and read it out loud to me, will you? That way, I can give my mind a rest.
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Huh? Um, that's why you brought me along?
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Don't like that plan? Okay, then I'll read one for you. Hmm... how about "Young and Hopelessly Smitten"?
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Xingqiu, don't you think you have one too many frivolous books in your collection...
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Okay... "A Guide to Getting Ahead in Yujing Terrace." How about this one, then?
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Ugh... Really, Xingqiu...

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 10 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Legends claim that the Stove God once appeared at the Guili Assembly. As Wangshu Inn is the oldest extant building in this area, any historical texts from around these parts are likely to have ended up here.

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 10 yanxiao 12.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' The boss told me to take care of him, but this guy, let me tell you &mdash; he is one tough nut to crack. He usually turns his nose up at everything that isn't [[Almond Tofu]].

:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj001 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Whew... This book is pretty complicated...

;(After obtaining a Satisfying Salad)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That should do it!

;(Talk to Smiley Yanxiao)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 01.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Alright, thanks for that. I think I've got it now.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You got all the steps down, right?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 02.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Of course. Don't forget, I am the best chef around these parts.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go see what Keqing and Xiangling are up to.
:;(Traveler, Paimon, and Smiley Yanxiao approach Keqing and Xiangling)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Keqing, Xiangling, we're back!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' You've finished cooking? Good timing, we've finished our reading, too.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 03.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' And? Useful, or no?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Useful. There is a passage concerning the Stove God, and it's not what we were expecting.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I quote: "60 miles to the northwest is the Guili Assembly. Many were settled there, where they hunted in groups, farmed the land, and made their living from what the soil yielded."
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' "When the Stove God descended, one god became many, all of which were the height of children. As does a star when it descends into the world, so the Stove God went out among the common folk and taught them to create fire. With fire, the people at last learned to make hot food, and they dined on rice congee and cooked meat thereafter."
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' This is a radically different account from the one given in "Demystifying the Legends of Liyue," and also a conflicting one.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "One god became many"... Does that mean there was more than one Stove God?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Taking the text at face value, that is what it says.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' "Went out among the common folk and taught them to create fire"... So, did the Stove God really go and teach people how to cook firsthand?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 04.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Now that's a god who truly cared for their people.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we've got two leads, but they contradict each other. How do we know which one to believe?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' By continuing with our investigation, and reserving judgment for now.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Thank you for this text, Yanxiao.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 05.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' It's my pleasure, really. Think nothing of it. If anything, I should be thanking the Traveler.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 06.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Listen, you've helped me an awful lot &mdash; not just today but in the past, too. I wanna make it up to you properly, and as it happens, things are pretty quiet here today. So I'd like to take the chance to treat you all. What do you say &mdash; will you stay for a meal?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Wow, he sure sounds confident in his cooking! I like that &mdash; confidence is one of the best ingredients a chef can have!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I really wanna try his cooking. I say we take him up on his offer!
:{{DIcon}} Keqing, can you spare the time?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's hard to refuse a generous offer like that... Yes, I think we can fit this in.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yanxiao, we await your culinary creations with great anticipation.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 12 yanxiao 07.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Haha, I won't disappoint!

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mmmm~! It smells {{Not a typo|beauuuutiful}}!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Strange, I never would have guessed that such a gifted chef worked here. This inn isn't particularly known for its food.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 yanxiao 02.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Everyone likes a good meal, whether they're staying the night or just stopping by for a bite. We call it an inn, but the fact is, it's much more than that. We have to cater to all aspects of daily life to make this a true home away from home.

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 yanxiao 06.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Hah... interesting. Alright, I'll see you there!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What was that? Some kind of power move?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' No, it seemed more sportsmanlike than that.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Yep! He's a really talented chef. His food was excellent, and it showed he has a level-headed personality. That's the kind of chef that could be a match for me.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I haven't had any competitive cooking experience since my cook-off with [[Brook]] in [[Springvale]].

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' You ate every last one... *sigh* Guoba, we've been through this. When we're with friends, you gotta be on your best behavior, okay?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I'm so sorry, Keqing, I promise I'll make it up to you!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the big deal? We can just get another plate. After all, it's Yanxiao's treat today.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 12.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' It's not the same, though! The moment's gone. Sure, you can eat something else, but you can never go back and change that feeling of despair as your food is snatched away from right under your nose...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 13.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' The dining experience is a trinity of emotion, food, and atmosphere, and you've gotta have all three to make it work!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I have to say, now that you mention it, that is a very accurate appraisal of the situation...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 14.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I'm gonna make it up to you, Keqing. Is there anything you wanna eat? Anything at all! Whatever it is, I'll make it for you!

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (I don't have high hopes for this, but equally I don't want her feeling guilty... Okay, I'll let her do this for me.)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If you insist, there is one dish that perhaps you could try making for me. It's an old recipe from my grandfather's notes.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 xiangling 15.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' No problem. May I see it?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 13 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'll get it to you when we're back in Liyue Harbor.

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I need your advice on something... What do I need to do to get along with Xiangling?
:{{DIcon}} ...Hmm?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Seriously? That's what's stressing you out?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' What's so strange about it? Why are you looking at me like that...?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're super smart and you're always so sure of yourself. Paimon thought you'd never need advice from anyone about anything.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Well that's just ridiculous...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Xiangling's always so warm and friendly with me, this time especially, and now she's desperate to do me a favor... So is that supposed to mean... uh, we're friends already?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'm just not used to dealing with people who are so warm right from the get-go. How exactly am I supposed to respond to that?
:{{DIcon}} Just smile back once in a while.
:{{DIcon}} Just grin and bear it.
:{{DIcon}} You seem to be getting along fine already.

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 14 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ahem! Noted. Thank you, Traveler, I'll see you again shortly.

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon can explain.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But this was your idea! Why you gotta dump it on Paimon!? Urgh...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so, back at Wangshu Inn, we noticed you and Keqing were getting along pretty well. So you really like hanging out with her, huh?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Yep! Keqing's good-natured and easy to be around. The kind of person everyone wants to know, right?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're a braver person than Paimon... The first time we met Keqing, Paimon found her pretty intimidating...
:{{DIcon}} She does have a formidable presence.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' You think so? I remember thinking straight away that she was really easy to get along with. Didn't you see her sneaking treats to Guoba back at Wangshu Inn?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, she's great, we know that now! We're just talking about first impressions.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' First impressions? Oh, okay &mdash; Hey, have you guys eaten grilled shellfish before? They can be hard to crack at first. But they taste amazing that way.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've eaten shellfish before, but... nope, don't think we've tried eating them grilled.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, you're missing out! I'll grill some for you another time. But anyway, Keqing's like a shellfish. Maybe a little closed-off at first, but once you get to know her, she's got a soft and squishy side, too!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Not to mention that even after her favorite food was stolen away, she was still happy looking after Guoba. I'm really grateful for that.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You make a good point.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, (Traveler), Xiangling's intuition for people seems really spot-on. Is that why she took a liking to Keqing so quickly?
:{{DIcon}} I think so.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Alright, let's see... We're okay for [[Carrot]]s and [[Crab]], and we still got some [[Ham]] and [[Mushroom]]s... Hmm, I wonder what Keqing's recipe is gonna be?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What was that noise!?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' What's going on?

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Well spoken. One shall let this young lady's enlightened words atone for the ignorant ones of her friend.
:{{DIcon}} It's been a while.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 04.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' A while it has indeed been, Traveler. Does one surmise correctly that you hasten hither to partake in the Moonchase Festival?
:{{DIcon}} You could put it like that, yeah...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 05.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Ah so, even the illustrious Traveler has been summoned to attend the Moonchase Festival. As expected, this year's theme stands proud against the test of public scrutiny.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 12.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' The theme? You mean "Feast of the Bounteous Land"?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 06.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The very same. Moonchase Festival falls during the season when many cooking ingredients are ripe, hence it is a fitting time to enjoy the finest of foods. One noticed the relative pomp and ceremony with which this year's affairs are being conducted, and could not abide to stand idly by.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 07.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Let it be known that one's culinary proficiency and ingenuity is uncontested in all the world!

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 10.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph. That which is implicitly understood needs not be made explicit, let alone official.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 cloudretainer 11.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' I shall say no more, and dwell here no longer. Await my word! Be there or beware!

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She definitely, definitely loves her food.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 keqing 01.ogg}} '''???:''' What are you all huddled together over here for? The adeptus left already.

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Sorry I kept you waiting. Xiangling, this is the recipe from my grandfather's notes. They're not in the best condition, so rather than bring them out of the house, I just transcribed the recipe.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Unfortunately, the texts my grandfather worked with were very old &mdash; usually faded, damaged, or both. Some parts are missing from this recipe, too. Do you think you'll still be able to work with it?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 15.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, okay! Lemme take a look... Hmm... Mm-hmm... Mm, mm.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 15 xiangling 16.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Gimme some time, I need to look into it!

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Sorry to interrupt your conversation... I was in the area buying a few things and I heard the disturbance, so I felt compelled to come take a look...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' You mean Cloud Retainer? I saw her too. She just suddenly showed up right in the middle of the street... Whatever adeptal power that was, she certainly knows how to make an entrance.

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Do you, uh, have a moment? I need to... discuss something with you.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' What is it, Ganyu? Has something urgent come up while I've been out?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' No, it's nothing work-related. I wanted to ask about... um, something personal. Is that okay?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (A personal matter... involving me? Surely I haven't done anything improper recently, have I?)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Please, Lady Keqing? This is really important to me...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh, uh, okay.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I noticed Cloud Retainer was here for quite a while. Did she say anything about... m&mdash;me? When I was young?

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 09.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I was getting really worried... Once she gets talking to people, she tends to go off on all sorts of tangents... so I was worried she might have bored you with some stories about me, heh...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Your name didn't even come up. So you've nothing to worry about.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Keqing, how are you not asking a bunch of questions right now? There's obviously some juicy gossip here, aren't you curious to find out what it is?
:;(Traveler nods in agreement)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 10.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Ah! P&mdash;Please, no, don't do that to me...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Of course not. Whatever it is, I'm not curious, and I'm not going to ask.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If Ganyu has a secret and she wishes to keep it that way, nobody should make it their business to try and get it out of her. That's just basic decency, is it not?

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 12.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Thank you. You're so kind and considerate... I've always seen that in you.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Wh&mdash;What's that got to do with... Honestly. Go on, you should be getting back now.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 13.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Oh my, you're right, I should. Okay everyone, please excuse me, I should get back to work now. Take good care of Keqing for me.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hey! What are you trying to say!?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, don't worry, Ganyu, we will!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 ganyu 14.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Thanks. Hope to see you again soon.
:;(Ganyu leaves)
:{{DIcon}} At the end there, she sounded like your big sister.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ehh... just ignore her.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hey everyone! I just had an idea!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' It only occurred to me when that adeptus showed up. Do you think the Stove God could be an adeptus too?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Could be!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I don't want to assert either way... but it seems highly likely.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' In that case, we should go ask the adepti about it. I think my master might be able to help.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Master? You mean, your teacher is an adeptus?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 16 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Uh-huh, she's over at Yujing Terrace. C'mon, I'll introduce you!

;(Approach Madame Ping)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Master!
:;(Guoba waves to Madame Ping)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 gooba 01.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 01.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hehe, hello Xiangling.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Madame Ping]] is Xiangling's master!?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I did not expect that...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Master, how are you keeping these days? Are you well?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 02.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Very well, thank you. What a surprise it is that you all had the time to come and visit me today.
:{{DIcon}} Hi, Madame Ping!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hello.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Master, we came here because we have a question for you. Do you know about the Stove God?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 03.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Of course I know the Stove God.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Does this mean... you know them personally?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 04.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Ah, I see... it's the Moonchase Festival, isn't it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 05.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' How interesting... Haha, so, you came to hear some stories about the Stove God?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' That's right, we're investigating something that happened recently.

:'''Keqing tells Madame Ping about everything that happened...'''

:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 06.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I see... The great stone surfaces, and so you open an investigation. Hehe.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 07.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I must commend your guesswork this far. I did indeed know the Stove God of whom you speak. But it was a great many years ago.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 08.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Moonchase was originally a rite observed by the adepti &mdash; not something in which the ordinary people of Liyue would ever partake. But over the years they have sought to emulate it for themselves many times, giving rise to various festivals bearing the Moonchase name.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 09.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' On nights when the moon shone bright, everybody would get together for joyful reunions. There would be fine food, fine wines, and choice teas.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 10.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Later, Rex Lapis unified all of these various festivals under the Moonchase name, to honor an old friend of his. In short, the heavens were our witness as we vowed to the moon to come together in joyful solidarity, to remember the past and reflect upon the present. That is the meaning of the Moonchase Festival.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Rex Lapis... *sigh*
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 11.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hehe... That friend made many contributions to Liyue, and Rex Lapis would not have them go unrecognized. Turning this season into a commemoration of his old friend was also a way to honor that friendship.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 12.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I can only presume that the Stove God Festival was one of the many subsumed into the Moonchase Festival.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' In the hands of Rex Lapis, our nation's traditions were faithfully upheld... It is to their detriment that we must now be the ones to inherit this duty.
:{{DIcon}} Aww, Keqing...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 13.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Oh, Keqing, I simply won't allow you to be so down on yourself. Nothing would delight Rex Lapis more than to know that those who follow in his footsteps continue to value these traditions and are working tirelessly to do them justice.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' ...Thank you.
:;(Xiangsheng appears)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 soldier 01.ogg}} '''Xiangsheng:''' Lady Keqing!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 soldier 02.ogg}} '''Xiangsheng:''' Lady Keqing, Lady Ningguang wishes to speak with you.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ningguang's looking for me?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Must be important... Please excuse me, everyone. If I'm not back soon, you'll find me at Ningguang's office.
:;(Keqing leaves)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' There she goes... Keqing's a lot more serious when she's got her work face on.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 14.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Do you want to know who Rex Lapis' friend was?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Paimon does!
:{{DIcon}} The Stove God is the friend, right?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 15.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Yes, precisely. There are few genuine coincidences in the world... the story of the lost festival and the old friend are indeed one and the same.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 16.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' The Stove God was a good friend of mine too. What a pity it is that the god is now gone both from the world and from people's memories.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' How could that happen...
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 17.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' It is to everyone's regret that the Stove God passed. But gods cannot be fully destroyed, and we made a pact to wait until the land became fruitful once more, for perhaps the Stove God would then return, albeit in a new form.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Really? ...Master, you must miss the Stove God a lot, right? From the way you talk about it all, it sounds like you were the best of friends.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 18.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Yes, thinking back on it all, there are many fond memories.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 19.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I'm pleasantly surprised to find that Keqing is investigating this. She is a tenacious child, and anything she sets her mind to, she will diligently pursue. It warms my heart, and makes me want to give her a helping hand.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 20.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Unfortunately, however, I cannot simply give her the answer, for the process is of great importance to her.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 21.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Keqing's grandfather once researched the Stove God, and now she follows in his footsteps... Since Keqing has inherited this conundrum, so too she must inherit the journey to its resolution.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You knew Keqing's grandpa?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 22.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Of course! I count all the people of Liyue among my good friends. I remember when he was the same age as Keqing is now.... Ah, so young. Hehe.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 23.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Grandparent and grandchild are definitely made from the same mold. Both diligent enough to take on anything, and bold enough to see it through to the end.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 24.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I like to think of Liyue as my own little potted plant. I've watched it grow and blossom, and it grows more beautiful all the time. In the blink of an eye, the buds of yesterday are in full bloom today... It's wonderful to see.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 25.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' For new blossoms must bloom on the branches if the tree is to remain evergreen and ever young.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 26.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' My dears, you are absolutely right to focus your investigation on the stone. It is, as you suppose, the lost Statue of the Stove God, and within it lie all the answers that you seek.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 17 madameping 27.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I should like to see the stone for myself, if you would lead me to it. Perhaps the truth will emerge even as we watch on.
----
;(Approach the stone)
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ah, you're all here! I was just about to send someone to fetch you.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 madameping 01.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Keqing, has the stone undergone any changes?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' A crack has appeared in one corner. But we still can't tell what's inside.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened? Did someone chip it while no one else was looking?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' More likely a natural occurrence. Our weapons have had no effect on it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' How would a "natural occurrence" crack it open?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 madameping 02.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' This is because the Stove God draws power from the actions of the masses. The heat of a busy kitchen, the joy of a reunion... Haha, keep up the good work and the truth will rise to the surface soon enough.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All the books say that the Stove God is the deity of food. So is this stone opening up because everyone's cooking for the festival?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Statues draw power from their people... so if the Stove God has dominion over cooking, could it be that the passion people put into their cooking gives power to the Stove God?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ningguang and I chose "Feast of the Bounteous Land" as this year's theme, and now every chef signed up for the competition is busy preparing... Paimon's theory is not an unreasonable one.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Plus, a lot of families have reunion feasts around this time. With everyone back home, the whole city's bustling with people, and that adds a lot to the festive atmosphere.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So if the stone cracked because Liyue started getting festive, that must mean that when the festive fever peaks, it'll bust right open! Right?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' That's gotta be it! Right, Master?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 madameping 03.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hahaha, well, we'll have to see then, won't we?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Okay. The fact that cooking is involved gives us a perfect opportunity.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The selections phase of Masterful Chefs will be held indoors and seen by only a few people, but the finals will be held outside, in public. Everyone who wants to will be able to come and watch it. The atmosphere will be incredibly lively, no question.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And when the finals end, boom! We'll get to see who the Stove God really is. Right?
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's definitely a possibility.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Well I've already signed up, so I should be able to help!
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes. For a chef as accomplished as yourself, getting to the finals should be a breeze.
:{{A|vo eqzyj001 18 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All this talk of cooking competitions is making Paimon hungry... Ah, Paimon can't wait! It'd be great if Paimon could take a nap and then wake up when it's the finals!
