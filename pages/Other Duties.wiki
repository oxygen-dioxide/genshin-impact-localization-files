{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Linorea, optional)
:'''Linorea:''' [[Fontaine Research Institute]]... You shall not escape punishment!
:'''Linorea:''' Curses... If only she'd reply. Then I'd have time to take care of those {{color|buzzword|Rainbow Roses}} we have at home.
:'''Linorea:''' Next time, I'll make sure I wear some {{color|buzzword|Marcotte perfume}} before speaking to her!
:'''Linorea:''' *sigh* I even need Semaine's help to care for the fish at home... and he's invited me to the opera...
:'''Linorea:''' But will I really make a satisfactory date for him the way I am now...?
:'''Linorea:''' Fontaine Research Institute... Just you wait!

;(Talk to Semaine)
:'''Semaine:''' What made her angry this time...
;(If the player has not completed this commission before)
::{{DIcon}} Semaine?
::{{DIcon}} ''(If the player has met Semaine)'' You're... that guy from the Maison Gestion...
::'''Semaine:''' Traveler? Why, fancy meeting you here. How may I be of service? It would be my honor to...
::{{DIcon}} Please get to the point.
::'''Semaine:''' Ah. Sorry. I've been doing a lot of writing lately, so all these descriptors just came tumbling right out of my mouth.
::{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::{{DIcon}} You seem a little frustrated.
::'''Semaine:''' *sigh* Don't even talk about it. I was preparing to go to the opera with Linorea, but before we could head out, she suddenly received a letter from her colleague.
:;(If the player has completed ''[[At Least the Fish Know]]'')
:::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Linorea... Is that the really imposing journalist we met previously?
:::'''Paimon:''' Didn't think we'd see her here as well...
::'''Semaine:''' She continued to read as we walked, and she'd finished it by the time we reached the opera house. After that...
::'''Semaine:''' ...And then she fell into a terrible sulk, writing furiously in her notebook. She was inconsolable...
::'''Semaine:''' Oh, right, by the way, she's my girlfriend.
::'''Semaine:''' If not for the situation that arose today, she would have been most happy to meet you two...
::{{DIcon}} You sound quite used to this.
:::'''Semaine:''' We've been together for so long... I've long gotten used to her temper.
::{{DIcon}} Do you know why she's angry?
:::'''Semaine:''' *sigh* What else can it be, if not that Mekafish business? She always gets so worked up about environmental protection.
::'''Semaine:''' I usually get her a present whenever she's upset &mdash; all to divert her attention to the good things, you know?
::'''Semaine:''' Better that than to let her stew. That's not good for her health.
::'''Semaine:''' Traveler, could you help me pick the gift this time?
::{{DIcon}} But she's your girlfriend.
::{{DIcon}} I'm not good at stuff like this.
::'''Semaine:''' Oh, don't worry about it. I always pick things she likes. You don't need to worry about ruining her mood or anything.
::'''Semaine:''' I just need a second opinion from outside. Y'know, for perspective.
:;(If the player has not completed ''At Least the Fish Know'')
:::'''Semaine:''' See, I usually send either flowers or perfumes.
:::'''Semaine:''' So please, help me make the final decision.
:;(If the player has completed ''At Least the Fish Know'')
:::'''Semaine:''' See, I usually send either flowers or perfumes... or fish fry.
:::'''Paimon:''' Wait, who sends their girlfriend fish fry!?
:::{{DIcon}} You know, Linorea might actually be the type to like that.
:::'''Paimon:''' Seriously? Well, when we last met Linorea, she really was distributing fish fry...
:::'''Paimon:''' But would anyone take that stuff as a present?
:::'''Semaine:''' Oh, she loves them! She's always discussing them with her friends, talking about things like "breeding" and other matters I don't really understand.
:::'''Semaine:''' We also have a large number of fish tanks in our house, filled with the fry she's raised.
:::{{DIcon}} What a unique person.
:::'''Semaine:''' Yes, I find this side of her most lovable as well.
:::'''Paimon:''' Look at this guy smile! It's like he's a different person from the one we see at the Maison Gestion...
:::'''Semaine:''' *cough* Heh. Well, in any case, please help me decide.
;(If the player has completed this commission before)
::{{DIcon}} What are you doing here this time?
::'''Semaine:''' Linorea has been enraged by that Damestier... again.
::'''Semaine:''' A few days back, Linorea and a few of her colleagues went to see that lady and asked her to give some clear answers about the Mekafish.
::'''Semaine:''' But she was all "I can't do anything. There's no point pestering me," as usual. Linorea was forced to go back empty-handed.
::'''Semaine:''' I wanted to invite her to go see an opera today and take her mind off these matters, but alas, she caught sight of the fish in the fountain and was once again reminded of her troubles.
::'''Semaine:''' And she... Well, she started sulking again.
::'''Paimon:''' Not to be rude or anything, but she sure does get angry easily...
::{{DIcon}} She really cares about her work.
::'''Semaine:''' More precisely, she really cares about her ideals. That's why she's such a brilliant journalist.
::{{DIcon}} But she's always so mad. Do you...
::'''Semaine:''' Yes, I find this side of her most lovable as well.
::'''Paimon:''' Okay, okay, cut it out, or your smile might split your face open!
:;(If the player has not completed ''At Least the Fish Know''){{verify}}
:::'''Semaine:''' Ahem!&nbsp;... Well, please help me make my final decision, just like the last time! Please!
:;(If the player has completed ''At Least the Fish Know''){{verify}}
:::'''Semaine:''' Ahem!&nbsp;... Well, please help me make my final decision, just like the last time!
:::'''Semaine:''' Flowers, perfume, or fish fry &mdash; please help me pick one!
:::'''Paimon:''' Wait, who sends their girlfriend fish fry!?
:::;(Dialogue continues same as above)
:{{DIcon}} Let's send flowers.
::'''Semaine:''' We had the same line of thought! A bouquet of fragrant flowers will improve her mood for sure.
::'''Semaine:''' She likes three kinds of flowers. {{color|buzzword|Rainbow Rose}}, {{color|buzzword|Romaritime Flower}}, and {{color|buzzword|Lumidouce Bell}}.
::'''Semaine:''' Could you bring me a bunch of flowers, Traveler? Any of these three will do.
::{{DIcon}} Not going yourself?
:::'''Semaine:''' I... can't leave at the moment. If she comes back around and finds me missing, I can forget about talking to her for the next two weeks.
::{{DIcon}} You didn't prepare the gift?
:::'''Semaine:''' I did order the flowers, but they will only arrive after the opera ends.
:::'''Semaine:''' And considering the current situation, it's up in the air whether she'll join me for that opera or not.
::'''Semaine:''' So please, help a man out, Traveler!
::{{DIcon}} You're a lot more motivated than when you're working.
::'''Semaine:''' Ah, but those are different matters! What is needed at the Maison Gestion is a stoic nature, but passion is a necessity when on a date with the one you love!
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, yeah, okay... Gah, he's giving us that silly smile again...
::;(Continues in [[#Flowers Version_2|Flowers Version]])
:{{DIcon}} Why don't we try sending perfume?
::'''Semaine:''' That's what I was thinking too! Linorea's almost out of perfume, so this is a wonderful idea!
::'''Semaine:''' We often buy perfume from Calcagni in the city. If you would be so kind, Traveler, please help us go to her.
::{{DIcon}} Not going yourself?
:::'''Semaine:''' I... can't leave at the moment. If she comes back around and finds me missing, I can forget about talking to her for the next two weeks.
::{{DIcon}} You didn't prepare the gift?
:::'''Semaine:''' We came to watch the opera, so even if we were going to purchase perfume, we'd have to get it after the performance, wouldn't you say?
:::'''Semaine:''' Anyway, who even sells perfume on Erinnyes? I mean... Anyway, I'm counting on you, Traveler!
::{{DIcon}} You're a lot more motivated than when you're working.
::'''Semaine:''' Ah, but those are different matters! What is needed at the Maison Gestion is a stoic nature, but passion is a necessity when on a date with the one you love!
::{{DIcon}} Okay, okay.
::'''Semaine:''' I left an advance payment with Calcagni, so you just need to go and pick the perfume up.
::'''Semaine:''' But please hurry! We can't make Linorea wait for too long...
::'''Paimon:''' Oh boy, this guy's silly smile is back again...
::;(Continues in [[#Perfume Version_2|Perfume Version]])
:{{DIcon}} Fish fry it is!
:;(If the player has completed ''At Least the Fish Know'')
::'''Semaine:''' Of course, my thoughts precisely! I was thinking of getting a new tank of fish fry for Linorea myself!
::'''Semaine:''' Since job-related issues are troubling her, our encouragement should follow that same angle.
::'''Semaine:''' Please make a trip to the Court of Fontaine on my behalf. The man you're looking for is named Batasso, Linorea's colleague. He's certain to have some good fish fry on him.
::'''Paimon:''' How are you so sure? What if he doesn't have any?
::'''Semaine:''' I... In truth, I've been asking this gentleman to teach me how to rear fish, and I've bought lots of high-quality fry from him as well... Of course, Linorea knows nothing about this.
::'''Semaine:''' Ah, yes, let me mark this location for you. Batasso tends to show up there.
::{{DIcon}} Your love is truly admirable...
::{{DIcon}} You're hopelessly in love with her, aren't you...
::'''Semaine:''' Well, she is just so lovable...
::'''Paimon:''' Let's go get the fry, {{Traveler}}. He can smile here all he wants!
::;(Continues in [[#Fish Fry Version_2|Fish Fry Version]])

===Flowers Version===
;(Talk to Semaine)
:'''Semaine:''' Have you brought Linorea's flowers? She likes three kinds, {{color|buzzword|Rainbow Rose}}, {{color|buzzword|Romaritime Flower}}, and {{color|buzzword|Lumidouce Bell}}. Any of them will do.
<!--::{{DIcon}} Not yet.
::'''Semaine:''' Thank you so much! Just bring them straight back to me once you find them.<!-- I suppose this one appears if you don't have any of the flowers in inventory, needs verifying and determining position in the list of options-->
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Already done.
::'''Semaine:''' In that case, give me the flowers.
::;(Opens item selection screen)
::'''Semaine:''' Thank you so much! This is a most lovely flower. It shall go to her right this instant!
::'''Paimon:''' Let's just watch from over here. If we get too close, things might get kinda...
::{{DIcon}} Awkward.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. Anyway, let's just hope Linorea does cheer up, eh?
:;(If the player gives [[Rainbow Rose]])
:::'''Linorea:''' This is... a Rainbow Rose.
:::'''Linorea:''' Sorry, Semaine. I was so preoccupied with taking Damestier on, that I forgot to care for that Rainbow Rose at home.
:::'''Linorea:''' I'm afraid that this one, too, will...
:::'''Semaine:''' Don't worry, Linorea. Go and do what you must. I promise that flowers that do not wilt will always be waiting for you at home.
:::'''Linorea:''' Oh, Semaine...
:;(If the player gives [[Romaritime Flower]])
:::'''Linorea:''' Why are you giving me Romaritime Flowers?
:::'''Semaine:''' I usually send you Rainbow Roses, but I thought that we should have a change of pace today.
:::'''Linorea:''' I see, is that so... Why do I feel like you're telling me to calm down?
:::'''Semaine:''' That is exactly the case, dear Linorea. Could you please do so? The opera is about to begin.
:::'''Linorea:''' Ah, alright, since you went to the trouble with these flowers... But you must stay with me, always. Someone has to make sure I remain calm, after all.
:::'''Semaine:''' Your wish is my command, milady. Not a step away shall I take.
:;(If the player gives [[Lumidouce Bell]])
:::'''Linorea:''' Hmph. Ah, dear, dear Semaine... A Lumidouce Bell, as a gift? Is this a threat? To break things off with me if I do not calm myself?
:::'''Semaine:''' Ah, come now, I would never imply such a thing. I just wish that your heart might be freed from these frustrations as soon as possible.
:::'''Semaine:''' The opera is about to begin. If your heart remains within their terrible grip, I fear we won't be able to enter the hall.
:::'''Linorea:''' ...
:::'''Linorea:''' Alright, alright. I'll do my best to put it out of my mind.
:::'''Linorea:''' Hmm... Which opera should we watch this time...
:{{DIcon}} Why are you just staring into space over here?
::'''Paimon:''' Also, aren't you gonna go console her? Don't upset people usually want someone by their side who'll hear what they have to say?
::'''Semaine:''' Linorea's different. She prefers to be alone at such times, because... she tends to say some... extreme things to herself in the heat of the moment.
::'''Semaine:''' I've tried to do so a few times, but she insists that I stay at the side, claiming "I don't want you to see me like this."
::'''Semaine:''' What could I do &mdash; if not only as she asked?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about [[Iaune]]...
::'''Semaine:''' He's a good kid, diligent, earnest, and loyal.
::'''Semaine:''' He's just going through a period of confusion that everyone's also been through. Once he gets through it and clears up what his ideals really are, he'll be fine.
::'''Semaine:''' Don't worry, [[Roialte]] and I will both help him out. I mean, he's one of us here at the office, isn't he?

===Perfume Version===
;(Talk to Semaine again, optional)
:'''Semaine:''' Ah, Traveler, thank goodness you're back. Have you the perfume with you?
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
::'''Semaine:''' Please, then. I'm counting on you.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you just staring into space over here?
::'''Paimon:''' Also, aren't you gonna go console her? Don't upset people usually want someone by their side who'll hear what they have to say?
::'''Semaine:''' Linorea's different. She prefers to be alone at such times, because... she tends to say some... extreme things to herself in the heat of the moment.
::'''Semaine:''' I've tried to do so a few times, but she insists that I stay at the side, claiming "I don't want you to see me like this."

::'''Semaine:''' Don't worry, Roialte and I will both help him out. I mean, he's one of us here at the office, isn't he?

;(Talk to Calcagni)
:'''Calcagni:''' Welcome. Are you here to purchase some perfume? We've just got some new stock.
:{{DIcon}} I'm here about Linorea's perfume...
:'''Calcagni:''' Oh, you mean Ms. Linorea? She comes around often to buy "Marcotte" perfume.
:'''Calcagni:''' According to her, she will only put it on when she goes out on official business.
:'''Calcagni:''' If I'm not mistaken, however, Mr. Semaine, who comes with her, prefers "Lakelight."
:'''Calcagni:''' Perhaps he favors gentler scents...
:'''Calcagni:''' Ah, yes! We did promote some "Tidalga" perfume previously. It has a unique algae scent. I do recall Ms. Linorea taking quite the interest in it.
:'''Calcagni:''' Semaine has already given us the Mora beforehand, so just take your pick, and I'll hand you the perfume of your choice.
:{{DIcon}} Let's go with Marcotte.
::'''Calcagni:''' Alright. Please wait a moment.
::;(Obtain {{Item|"Marcotte"}})
:{{DIcon}} Let's go with Lakelight.
::'''Calcagni:''' Alright. Please wait a moment.
::;(Obtain {{Item|"Lakelight"}})
:{{DIcon}} Let's go with Tidalga.
::'''Calcagni:''' Alright. Please wait a moment.
::;(Obtain {{Item|"Tidalga"}})
:{{DIcon}} Let me consider further...
::'''Calcagni:''' Once you have decided on the perfume you want, just tell me straight.

;(Talk to Calcagni again, optional)
:'''Calcagni:''' What sort of perfume should we make next time...

;(Talk to Semaine)
:'''Semaine:''' Ah, Traveler, thank goodness you're back. Have you the perfume with you?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Already done.
::'''Semaine:''' Ah, in that case, pass me the perfume.
:;(Opens item selection screen)
::'''Semaine:''' Excellent &mdash; this perfume smells phenomenal! Thank you so much!
::'''Semaine:''' I'll pass it to her right this instant!
::'''Paimon:''' Let's just watch from over here. If we get too close, things might get kinda...
::{{DIcon}} Awkward.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. Anyway, let's just hope Linorea does cheer up, eh?
:;(If player chose to give "Marcotte" perfume)
:::'''Linorea:''' Hah! This is exactly the perfume I need. Thank you, Semaine.
:::'''Linorea:''' I shall wear this perfume to go and interview that fool Damestier. I'll corner her with ease this time, just you see!
:::'''Semaine:''' Hahaha. I love it when you're so full of vigor, Linorea.
:::'''Semaine:''' But before you ride off to war, let's hurry and get to the opera house first, or we'll miss the opening for sure.
:::'''Linorea:''' Right you are! Let's enjoy the opera first. Then I'll collect my thoughts and crush that Damestier once and for all!
:;(If player chose to give "Lakelight" perfume)
:::'''Linorea:''' This perfume... Dear Semaine, are you reminding me to focus my attention on you?
:::'''Semaine:''' You could focus on the opera too... I just wish you wouldn't let all the Mekafish business ruin the wonderful time we spend together.
:::'''Linorea:''' ...Well, as you wish, my dear.
:;(If player chose to give "Tidalga" perfume)
:::'''Linorea:''' The scent of algae... Heh, this certainly brings the fish tank back to mind.
:::'''Linorea:''' I entrust you with everything while I go toe-to-toe with Damestier, dear Semaine.
:::'''Semaine:''' To attend to your ideals is my great honor, milady.
:::'''Linorea:''' *sigh* I find it hard to conceive of how a good fellow like you survives in an environment as idiotic as the Maison Gestion...
:::'''Semaine:''' I have a conscience, a sense of humor, and two excellent colleagues.
:::'''Semaine:''' And of course, I have you, milady, my constant companion.
:::'''Linorea:''' My, what a talker! Do you speak even half this much at the Maison Gestion?
:::'''Semaine:''' I barely speak at all while I'm there. Words do my work no good.
:::'''Semaine:''' Alright, dear Linorea. The opera is about to begin, so let us be off.
:::'''Linorea:''' As you say, my love. I shall do as you say.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you just staring into space over here?
::'''Paimon:''' Also, aren't you gonna go console her? Don't upset people usually want someone by their side who'll hear what they have to say?

::'''Semaine:''' Don't worry, Roialte and I will both help him out. I mean, he's one of us here at the office, isn't he?

===Fish Fry Version===
;(Talk to Semaine again, optional)
:'''Semaine:''' Traveler, thank goodness you're here. Did you get the fish fry?
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
::'''Semaine:''' Please, then. I'm counting on you.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you just staring into space over here?
::'''Paimon:''' Also, aren't you gonna go console her? Don't upset people usually want someone by their side who'll hear what they have to say?

;(Talk to Batasso)
:'''Batasso:''' Ah, Linorea... I fear your temper must itself be tempered...
:{{DIcon}} About Linorea's fish fry...
:{{Black Screen|You state your reasons for being here...}}
:'''Batasso:''' Semaine is... Well, his love for Linorea knows no worldly equal, I'll say that much.
:'''Batasso:''' Here, take these fry with you. Semaine requested that I find them... Plans to send them to her as a gift, I'll bet.
:'''Batasso:''' Alright, take the fry to Semaine, would you? I've got some other things to handle.
;(Obtain {{Item|Fry}})

;(Talk to Batasso again, optional)
:'''Batasso:''' Ah, when will Linorea's temper improve?

;(Talk to Semaine)
:'''Semaine:''' Traveler, thank goodness you're here. Did you get the fish fry?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Already done.
::'''Semaine:''' Ah. In that case, please give them to me.
:;(Opens item selection screen)
::'''Semaine:''' Wonderful! Batasso is reliable, as always. Linorea will surely love these fish fry.
::'''Semaine:''' I'll pass it to her right this instant!
::'''Paimon:''' Let's just watch from over here. If we get too close, things might get kinda...
::{{DIcon}} Awkward.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. Anyway, let's just hope Linorea does cheer up, eh?
::'''Linorea:''' Where... did you get these fish fry?
::'''Semaine:''' Hmm, didn't you tell me before that you wanted to investigate the fry in that particular body of water?
::'''Semaine:''' That's why I asked a good friend of mine to collect some. I treated him to quite a few meals on that account.
::'''Linorea:''' But when did I... Ah! Was that the day when we went boating... But I only said it in passing...
::'''Semaine:''' Ah, don't underestimate the memory of a Gestionnaire, milady.
::'''Linorea:''' Semaine...
::'''Semaine:''' Alright. Let's admire this tank of fish fry later. For now, let us go into the opera house. The show is about to begin.
::'''Semaine:''' Ah, I daresay that we are the only ones in the Court of Fontaine who would bring a fish tank to an opera.
::'''Linorea:''' And that's a good thing. It makes us unique.
::'''Semaine:''' Indeed, my dear lady. In that case, let us be off.
::'''Linorea:''' As you say, Semaine.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you just staring into space over here?
