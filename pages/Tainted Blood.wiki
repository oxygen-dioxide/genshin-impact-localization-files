'''Tainted Blood''' is a Quest item obtained after completing the [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]]: Act III - [[Song of the Dragon and Freedom]] quest "[[A Long Shot]]".

==Archive Description==
Substance acquired from defeating [[Dvalin]].<br />
A crystal imbued with the winds of antiquity as well as another occult power from within the great dragon's body.

The mighty dragon was once a captive of a cage of toxicity, woven of three poisons:<br />
The foul blood he once ingested, the lies whispered from the [[Abyss]], and the anguish of abandonment. Through tears shed and songs sung, the unholy spikes that had grown on Dvalin's body were smashed to pieces, and the web that had ensnared him was torn away...<br />
Perhaps these feats were achievable only by a free-spirited [[traveler]] from a far-away land.
