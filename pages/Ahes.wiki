==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ahes:''' Hello there! I'm presently reading the sailing logs. Captain Basil really is impressive &mdash; I've learned so much just from reading the logs she left.
:'''Ahes:''' Even though the [[Sponsian]]'s been... But I'm more than satisfied with having been able to witness her past from these records!
:{{DIcon}} How've things been going lately?
::'''Ahes:''' I've been sorting through Captain Basil's navigation maps. It's been tough going, but it's also been really fun!
::'''Ahes:''' I've learned about many lost ports through reading other stories in the past, and I've been able to approximate their locations through her records and the clues she left.
::'''Ahes:''' Still, there are some things I don't quite understand...
::{{DIcon}} Things you don't quite understand?
:::'''Ahes:''' That's right. Some of her logs constantly mention this place called the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]], and she often talks about "the children there"...
:::'''Ahes:''' I think that must've been some sort of school with lots of kids. If I had more corroborating evidence, I could prove this hypothesis of mine.
::{{DIcon}} I hope your restoration work goes smoothly!
:::'''Ahes:''' Yup. I searched for the Sponsian for so, so long...
:::'''Ahes:''' And thanks to your help, I managed to find these logs and maps!
:::'''Ahes:''' The restoration's slow going, but I believe that as long as I persist, I'll finish it someday!
:{{DIcon}} That's good...
::'''Ahes:''' Yup. Maybe someday, I'll have my own ship, and I can sail the seas just like she did.
