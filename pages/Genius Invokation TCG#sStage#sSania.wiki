;(Talk to Sania)
:'''Sania:''' Once I become a famous player, I'll be able to advertise and win lots of prizes...
:'''Sania:''' Are you my next opponent?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Let's play Genius Invokation TCG.
:;(Open Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Sania:''' Alright then, we can do this next time... Assuming I earn enough Mora and haven't packed up and left for home.

;(If the player loses the match)
:'''Sania:''' Sorry, but I'm doing this for the Mora!

;(If the player wins the match)
:'''Sania:''' How... Does this mean that I won't be able to make a living off Genius Invokation TCG either?
