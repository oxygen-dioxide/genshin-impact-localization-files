|description  = An obsidian fragment with engraved patterns styled like those of the Scions of the Canopy, which you obtained by chance while exploring. It appears that you could form a full ring using three of them, though what that will achieve, you cannot tell.

'''Green Obsidian Fragment''' is a [[Consumable]] that can be found in [[Natlan]]. Collecting all 3 will allow the player to craft the [[Green Obsidian Ring]]. Each part has a chance to drop randomly from any [[Chest|Precious or Luxurious Chests]] in [[Coatepec Mountain]] or in [[Basin of Unnumbered Flames]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Due to this item being a random drop from any Precious or Luxurious Chest, collecting all 3 may require the player to do the following:
** Complete the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]]: [[Offerings to the Treasure Stone]].
** Open a [[Shrine of Depths]] in the [[Coatepec Mountain]] or [[Basin of Unnumbered Flames]].
** Complete the [[Chamber of Night's Trial]], thus collecting all 3 [[Shattered Night Jade]].
** Complete the [[Warrior's Challenge]].
* [[Adventure Rank]] 45 is required to craft this item into the Green Obsidian Ring. Attempting to craft the ring without meeting the requirements displays the following message:
*; '''Adventure Rank too low. Cannot craft'''
