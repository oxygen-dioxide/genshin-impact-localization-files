==Descriptions==
{{Description|In ancient times, there was a sage who attained such mastery of the art of Phlogiston Engraving that they could transform all its many meanings into graceful drifting lines. With phlogiston as their medium, they used towering cliffs as canvases for vibrant murals. This, it is said, is the origin of Natlan graffiti as we know it now.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}
