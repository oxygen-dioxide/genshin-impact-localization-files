{{Quest Description|You picked up a strange dragon tooth while adventuring in Dragonspine. Perhaps you should ask around and see if someone knows anything more about it...}}

;(Picking up a Strange Tooth)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What's this... Looks like a tooth.
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe there'll be some interesting history behind it? Let's go ask around.
----
;(Talk to Iris)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Any ideas about this tooth?
:'''Iris:''' A tooth? Let me see.
:'''Iris:''' Hmm... Yes, it is a little unusual, both in shape and in size.
:'''Iris:''' I'm no expert on obscure materials... Orban may know something though, he comes across all sorts of materials in the process of forging weaponry
:'''Iris:''' Why not go and ask him? He's right over there, you can't miss him.
----
;(Talk to Orban)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} What do you make of this tooth?
:'''Orban:''' A tooth? Ugh, don't tell me you've been foraging around on the mountain for junk...
:'''Orban:''' ...Huh, although, as teeth go...
:{{DIcon}} What? What is it?
:'''Orban:''' This is a rather fine specimen. Tough as nails, too...
:'''Orban:''' And these contours... Looks an awful lot like Dragontooth to me.
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean, "Dragontooth"?
:'''Orban:''' As in, the tooth of a dragon. Weapons made from Dragontooth are supposed to be extraordinarily strong and sharp... and even possess some sort of strange power.
:'''Orban:''' It's hardly the sort of thing you come across every day, though... In all the stories you hear, it's only ever the most famous heroes who manage to acquire Dragontooth and craft weapons from it.
:'''Orban:''' As they say, if you plan on slaying the dragon to pinch his teeth... you'd better be sure to have a dragon-slayer of a weapon handy, or he might just bite back!
:{{DIcon}} Then... is this really a dragon's tooth, or not?
:'''Orban:''' Honestly, I've never dealt with Dragontooth firsthand, so I can't give a definite answer.
:'''Orban:''' I do think it has to be the tooth of some enormous beast or other...
:'''Orban:''' Anyway, since you've gone to all this effort... let's just treat it as if it really is a genuine, precious piece of Dragontooth, shall we?
:'''Orban:''' Hmm, but that said &mdash; it's not enough to make a weapon from.
:'''Orban:''' How about you go find, say, three more pieces of Dragontooth, and in the meantime, I'll do some reading and find out how to work with this stuff.
:'''Orban:''' Oh &mdash; and {{Color|buzzword|Dragontooth}} aside, we'll want to supplement it with some good ore...
:'''Orban:''' In which case, while you're up on the mountain, grab 50 pieces of {{Color|buzzword|Starsilver}}.
:'''Orban:''' Ah yes, and as well as all that... I'm also going to need a {{Color|buzzword|Northlander Polearm Prototype}}...
:'''Orban:''' Once you've got all of that, come and see me again.

;(Talk to Orban again)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Thoughts on this Dragontooth?
:'''Orban:''' I can't say whether it really is Dragontooth or not, but the quality is superb. A few more like this, supplemented with some Starsilver, and you could definitely make a good weapon from it.
:'''Orban:''' As soon as you've gathered all that, bring the goods straight back here.
----
{{Quest Description|update|You pass the Strange Tooth to Orban, and he says that this can be used to forge a weapon. But he also notes that you will need to collect 3 such teeth, 50 Starsilver Ore, and one Northlander Polearm Prototype to do so.}}

;(Upon entering the cave that has one of the Dragontooth inside)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, it's... What is it?
:'''Paimon:''' It looks just like a heart, doesn't it?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Can we go now? It really is super creepy in here.
----
;(Talk to Orban after collecting all of the items)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I found some more Dragontooth...
:'''Orban:''' Ah, I was hoping you'd swing by. Listen, before you go gathering all that Dragontooth... Oh. I see you've already finished.
:'''Orban:''' My profuse apologies... but I've hit a slight snag. No matter what I hit this thing with, I simply cannot take so much as a sliver off of it.
:'''Orban:''' It's almost as if it really were Dragontooth... If so, then based on what I read, there are several rather specific methods to work with this material.
:'''Orban:''' One of them is to have the dragon's tooth absorb some sort of... dragon-related "vitality."
:'''Orban:''' Then, use the dragon's tooth infused with dragon vitality to work the other pieces of Dragontooth into shape.
:'''Orban:''' But how to go about infusing something with dragon vitality... I haven't the foggiest idea.
:'''Orban:''' Any thoughts, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} I'll, um... see what I can do.
:'''Orban:''' Great! Here &mdash; you take this Dragontooth, then, and I'll leave that whole side of things to you.
:'''Orban:''' Huh, if just the teeth cause this much hassle, whole dragons must be seriously complicated creatures...

;(After talking to Orban)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, do you remember that place from earlier? Wasn't there something that looked a lot like a heart?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's try there! Maybe there's some vitality around there that we can absorb into the Dragontooth.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's not stay there longer than we need to, though. That place gives Paimon the creeps.
----
{{Quest Description|update|Though you have gathered all the necessary materials, Orban says that he cannot use ordinary means to work with these dragonteeth... You must first fill one Dragontooth with vitality in order to utilize the rest. Perhaps that strange... "heart" you found on Dragonspine will be of help in this matter...}}

;(After defeating the Fatui in the cave, interact with the heart)
:{{DIcon}} ???
:'''Core:''' (A strange glow emanates from this peculiar object...)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Extract Vitality with Dragontooth
:;(Opens material submission menu)
:'''Core:''' (This strange object seems to be reacting...)
:'''Paimon:''' The heart responded! Careful, we should expect the unexpected...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... there's some people coming!
:;(Fatui Skirmishers appear at the cave entrance)
:'''Paimon:''' Yikes! This isn't what Paimon meant by unexpected...
:'''Fatui Skirmisher:''' Hmph. So, your plans also involve the heart.
:'''Fatui Skirmisher:''' No matter, it seems you have saved us a great deal of work.
:'''Fatui Skirmisher:''' But our plans do not include others being privy to this secret!
:;(Combat begins)

;(After defeating all the Fatui Skirmishers)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon think<!--sic--> it's finished now...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go check on the Dragontooth.
:;(Investigate the heart)
:'''Paimon:''' Interesting... Something looks a little different about this Dragontooth now. And it seems more ominous, too...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's get back and give it to [[Orban]].
:;(Obtain [[Vitalized Dragontooth]] ×1)
----
;(Talk to Orban)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I'm here about the Dragontooth again...
:'''Orban:''' My goodness, the luster... and the texture...
:'''Orban:''' You actually managed it? You infused the tooth with dragon vitality? Wow... You are one extraordinary individual, my friend.
:'''Orban:''' This is great... I've already got someone to handle the Starsilver. Give me a moment or two, I will get this weapon made right away...
:;(Opens material submission menu)
:'''''Orban starts forging the weapon...'''''
:'''Orban:''' There! It's done! Haha! Here, hold that. How does it feel?
:{{DIcon}} How much do I owe you?
:'''Orban:''' Oh, don't worry about paying for it. The chance to work with these materials was a rare pleasure, no need to bring Mora into it.
:'''Orban:''' Alright. I'd say this weapon is ready for an adventure, wouldn't you? I hope you'll take good care of it.
:;(Obtain [[Primogem]] ×50, [[Diagram: Dragonspine Spear]] ×1, [[Dragonspine Spear]] ×1)
