'''The World's Shackles''' is [[Shenhe]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Shenhe's hair is parted off-center with evenly cut locks that flow just past chin-length framing her face, one side covering her right eye, the rest styled in a low, loose, thick braid fastened at the top below her shoulders with a red cord tied in a bow with her Cryo Vision mounted on it.

Her outfit consists of a black backless bodysuit that fades into a dark turquoise at the legs and has intricate patterns all over it. It extends to her hands, covering her middle fingers with a gold stud on each of the knuckles. At the back of her bodysuit is an article bearing resemblance to coattails, consisting of white fabric patterned with gray. She wears a cropped white-and-gray sleeveless qipao top over her bodysuit.

Her accessories consist of a detailed white-and-black curved headpiece and a red cloverleaf knot with a tassel as an earring on her right ear.
