|description    = This settlement is made in the style of [[Gandharva Ville]], with much aesthetic inspiration taken from the rainforest itself, such that you be able to live out the forest experience amidst the calming greens and blues regardless of the surrounding area.<br />Of course, you will need to master more survival skills for times when you must truly enter the forest, such as adjusting your routines and rhythms to avoid the minor quibbles caused by the humid climate. You might also need to understand some [[Forest Rangers]]' daily habits...
