'''Katsu Sandwich''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The [[recipe]] for Katsu Sandwich is obtainable from [[Ryouko]] in [[Ritou]] for 2500 [[Mora]].

Depending on the quality, Katsu Sandwich increases the party's attack by '''66'''/'''81'''/'''95''' for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].

When [[Shikanoin Heizou]] cooks Katsu Sandwich, there is a chance [[The Only Truth]] will be created instead.
