;(Talk to Taruka after completing ''[[From One Case to Another]]'')
:'''Taruka:''' No point trying to earn pity points with me. No means no.
:'''Oberon:''' Crooo...
:{{DIcon}} How are things? Getting along with Oberon?
::'''Oberon:''' Crooo...
::'''Taruka:''' Come on, you, aiming your Saurian-chick eyes at someone else won't help you either. Just give up already.
::'''Taruka:''' See, he's been like this ever since he got told to watch his diet. I'm doing this for his own good, you know... Hmm, that sounds like something Lamizana would say...
::'''Taruka:''' A&mdash;Anyway, I'll adjust his diet whenever his flying performance gets back on track, or when he grows into an adult. Don't you worry!
:{{DIcon}} About your sister...
::'''Taruka:''' She and Lamizana are the same as ever, still real close and all... Bah, I don't get what she sees in him.
::'''Taruka:''' But that's her decision to make, so I won't stop her. I've got my own concerns, after all.
::'''Taruka:''' There's a lot I have to do before I can become the best adventurer in the Flower-Feather Clan.
::'''Taruka:''' You've gotta become stronger with me, Oberon, or we won't be able to venture into Ochkanatlan together!
:{{DIcon}} I'll be off, then.
::'''Taruka:''' You're leaving? Alright. You're welcome back any time.
