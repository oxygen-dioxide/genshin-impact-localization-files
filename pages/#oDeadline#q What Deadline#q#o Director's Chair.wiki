|description    = A chair with a backrest. Made from branches, leaves, and vines, it is quite comfortable and will ease the exhaustion of any user racing to beat a deadline.<br>But the designer failed to consider that making a chair too comfortable can make those who sit in it too relaxed, and as they forget about their worries and carries, they will no longer feel nervous and anxious as the deadline approaches. This results in poor time management and working at too leisurely a pace, resulting in sudden panic when the user finally comes to their senses... Legend says a certain director once made this mistake, and it nearly resulted in calamity...
