|description     = A dish with braised meat and apples.
|desc_suspicious = Apart from a slight sourness, it tastes just like any other down-to-earth braised meat dish, and lacks any fruity aroma. One might even wonder if the apples were put in there at all.
|desc_basic      = The meat goes down smooth, its flavor dense, and when cut open, the meat juice that flows out bears traces of apple flavoring. An eye-popping, refreshing dish indeed.
|desc_delicious  = The meat is juicy in the extreme, and no matter how much of it you eat, you still want more. The way every breath you take is tinged with the flavor of apples reminds you of nothing so much as lying in an apple orchard.
