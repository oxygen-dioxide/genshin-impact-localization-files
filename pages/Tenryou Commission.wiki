The {{Lang|'''Tenryou Commission'''|ja=天領奉行|ja_rm=Tenryou-bugyou}} of the [[Tri-Commission]] is the executive arm of the [[Raiden Shogun]]. It is led by the [[Kujou Clan]] and is responsible for managing security and military affairs, including enforcement of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]],<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/l8YXe7EkmoU?t=1715 Version 2.0 Special Program]</ref> enforcement of the [[Sakoku Decree]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Together Under the Fireworks}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Hanamizaka Bulletin Board|Tenryou Notice}}</ref> Compared to the [[Kanjou Commission]] and [[Yashiro Commission]], the Tenryou Commission sees a higher desertion rate due to the reality and horrors of war plaguing them as a result of the Vision Hunt Decree in which the soldiers fight and kill other people, contrary to the expectations of some who had expected to fight ancient monsters and denizens of [[the Abyss]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou's Final Words}}</ref>

During the events of [[Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow]], the [[Traveler]] is placed on a wanted list by the Tenryou Commission after escaping the [[Vision Hunt Ceremony]] with [[Thoma]] and [[Paimon]]. After the events of [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], the commission is currently in disarray due to [[Kujou Takayuki]]'s collusion with the [[Fatui]], with the Shogun intending to mete out appropriate punishment when ready. With a replacement yet to be found, Kujou Sara occupies the role as a temporary fill-in.

Following the events of [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter]]: Act I, [[Ei]] challenges [[Takatsukasa Clan]] head &mdash; [[Takatsukasa Susumu]] &mdash; to a duel for the position of Tenryou Commissioner. In fear of the [[Raiden Shogun]], Susumu limply refuses the challenge while [[Kujou Kamaji]] accepts, knowing that he is outmatched but wishing to at least let the Kujou Clan's prestige end relatively honorably. After the duel, [[Ei]] remarks that while Kamaji is not a great descendant of the [[Kujou Clan]], his honor is admirable, and she decides to give the [[Kujou Clan]] more time.
