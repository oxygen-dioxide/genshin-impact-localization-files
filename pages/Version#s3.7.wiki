|description = A game of cards is much like life: Fortune decides the hand you are dealt, while experience might let you shift the tides of possibility toward all that could be.<br>Life is much like a game of cards: Victory is but the culminating point in the journey — the thrills of the duel, however, represent strings to melodies everlasting.

;Spiral Abyss
* Floor 11 Ley Line Disorders changed to:
** All party members' Normal Attack DMG increased by 50%.
* Updated the monster lineup on Floor 11 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Updated the monster lineup on Floor 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 3.7, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows：
** Phase I: Drumming Moon
***  After the character's Normal Attack hits an opponent, this opponent will be afflicted with a Sign of Snaring. After 3s, the Sign will be removed, dealing True DMG to this opponent. After a character's Normal Attack hits an opponent with a Sign of Snaring, the DMG dealt by the Sign's removal will be increased. This DMG can be increased for no more than 9 times.
** Phase II: Potent Moon
*** After the active character's Normal Attacks hit opponents, the DMG dealt by this character will increase by 12% for 2s. This effect can stack up to 5 times. Each stack's duration is counted independently. This effect can be triggered once every 0.05s. This effect will be canceled when the character leaves the field.
** Phase III: Willowy Moon
*** After the character's Normal Attack hits an opponent, the Physical or Elemental RES of this opponent will decrease by 6% for 2s, matching the Attribute of that attack. This can stack up to 6 times. RES decreases of different types can co-exist, and their stacks and timers will be independent of each other.
