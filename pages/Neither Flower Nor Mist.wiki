'''Neither Flower Nor Mist''' is [[Nilou]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Nilou's hair is tied loosely at the back into low twin tails. She sports a long white veil with blue embroidery stylized with gold and black horns, golden tassels, and a large gold head accessory somewhat resembling a crown.

Nilou's attire consists of a white and blue cropped top with baggy, detached sleeves and gold details going from her cuffs to her upper arms paired with a patterned dark blue skirt held together with a large blue bow adorned with a blue ornament. Nilou's skirt is decorated with numerous trinkets, tassels, blue gems, and fabrics with varying intricate designs. On her legs, she wears a gold trinket on her left thigh, and gold strapped knee-high heels. Her Hydro [[Vision]] is pinned to a large blue bow on the back of her skirt.
