==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xipilli:''' So long as we achieve our goal, what's the harm in trying something new!
:{{DIcon}} Do you mean...
::'''Xipilli:''' See, I'm an artisan who's opened a small store here.
::'''Xipilli:''' Everyone says that items created by the Masters of the Night-Wind have special effects, which is why business has been going well.
::'''Xipilli:''' My trick is to first ask customers not what they want, but what they want to do.
::'''Xipilli:''' For example... If someone wants to make a gourmet food detector, I'd suggest that they stay close to the person who they know loves eating the most.
::'''Xipilli:''' Simple principle, eh?
::{{DIcon}} But then, what about your business...
:::'''Xipilli:''' That's not how it works.
:::'''Xipilli:''' Think about it. How would you even make a gourmet food detector, anyway?
:::'''Xipilli:''' Rather than say I can't help them at all, isn't it better to find some other way to help a client solve their problem?
:{{DIcon}} Makes sense, too.
::'''Xipilli:''' That's right.
