{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kimpel:''' How did Lumidouce Harbor end up like this... it's just terrible.
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong with Lumidouce Harbor?
::'''Kimpel:''' Look at all those ships down there. Do you think there are more vessels from Fontaine or other places?
::'''Kimpel:''' Once, there were more Fontainian ships in the harbor. I don't know when it started, but at some point, there were more foreign ships instead.
::'''Kimpel:''' If this continues, can this harbor still be considered Fontaine's harbor?
::{{DIcon}} Lumidouce Harbor isn't the only harbor in Fontaine...
::'''Kimpel:''' I know, I know. But Lumidouce Harbor is an essential port. A vast quantity of international trade passes through here.
::'''Kimpel:''' However, not even the big cargo ships have been coming through the harbor much lately...
::'''Kimpel:''' I won't bother you with it now. I need to continue writing this advisory letter to Ms. [[Cassigneul]]. She should be able to turn things around here.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kimpel:''' Goodbye. Hmm, how should I start this advisory letter...
