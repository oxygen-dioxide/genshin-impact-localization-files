|description  = The people did not bow to [[Decarabian]] out of respect or adoration, but because the harsh winds had laid them low. This was the shattered dream and ambition of the Anemo [[Archon]]<ref group="Note">The Chinese version of this item's description refers to Decarabian as a {{zh|风神|tl=Wind God,}} which is a term typically translated as "Anemo Archon" in the English translation. Because of this, the English version calls Decarabian an Anemo Archon even though he was never a member of [[The Seven]]. Barbatos, who ascended to godhood after Decarabian's fall, is the first and only Anemo Archon among The Seven.</ref> before the rise of [[Barbatos]].<br />He tried so hard to make his dream come true, and so the fragments of that dream are still mighty.
