The '''Main City''' is a [[subarea]] in each [[region]] of Teyvat that provides amenities to the player. Many NPCs, [[Shops]], and other [[Points of Interest]] for a region can be found in its city. No enemies spawn inside of or travel to any city, but players can still receive damage from other sources, such as fires, [[Fall Damage|falling]], and drowning.

There are two [[Teleport Waypoints]] in each city. Activate both of them to unlock teleportation via shop pins.

The [[weather]] in cities is clear skies year-round. It never rains in cities in-game, although it may rain in-universe.<ref group="Note">Archon Quest, Chapter I, Act III, Part 6: [[The Fond Farewell]]<br />"Until one drizzly day, as I was strolling along the harbor, I heard a merchant tell one of his workers, ..."<br />The harbor mentioned must be [[Liyue Harbor]] as it is currently the only known harbor in Liyue.</ref><ref group="Note">[https://youtu.be/5DuZblVxG3I New Area Announcement: Of the Land Amidst Monoliths] opens with Klee running for cover from rain in the [[City of Mondstadt]].
