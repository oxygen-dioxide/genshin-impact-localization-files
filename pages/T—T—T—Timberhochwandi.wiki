==Trivia==
*The name of the achievement is a reference to the sound of the wood chopping made by Viking Villager in the game ''{{w|Age of Empires II}}''. The multiplied "T" seem to mimic the effect of quick clicking on the trees, causing the sound to repeat only the first letter. For an example, see [[w:c:ageofempires:Vikings#In-game dialogue language|here]].
