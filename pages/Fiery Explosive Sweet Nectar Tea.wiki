==Gameplay Notes==
* There is an additional chest available south of Xuanji obtainable by interacting with a dig spot multiple times.
* A hidden [[Floating Anemo Slime]] puzzle can be found by interacting with a separate lone Sweet Flower in the same area. The slimes seem to despawn if the player moves after activating it.
* It is possible to defeat the [[Whopperflower]]s prior to talking to Xuanji for a slightly different dialogue.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Xuanji after defeating the Whopperflowers)
:'''Xuanji:''' Yo! Dear customer, you look like your travels have you absolutely beat. Are you looking for a place to put up your feet and enjoy a cuppa tea?
:{{DIcon}} You have tea here?
:'''Xuanji:''' Just so! In fact, this is the only tea stall for miles around.
:'''Paimon:''' What teas do you have?
:'''Xuanji:''' Uh... Uh... Explo... Fiery Explosive Sweet Nectar Tea! Yeah, that's the one.
:'''Xuanji:''' It's a special type of tea made from wild Sweet Flowers and the nectar of Whopperflowers. It burns at first, but the aftertaste is cool and refreshing, and it's great for washing away exhaustion! You won't find it anywhere else.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, a tea Paimon's never heard of, and it sounds amazing, too!
:'''Xuanji:''' Unfortunately, yours truly has run out of the necessary ingredients. Fortunately, there are some close by, but unfortunately, it's a bit dangerous, since you've gotta pick Sweet Flowers while dealing with {{Color|buzzword|Pyro Whopperflowers}} that just pop up out of nowhere.
:'''Xuanji:''' So, now... Though it's really kinda embarrassing, would you mind just hanging around elsewhere for a bit? I'm going to patter on off to the [[Adventurers' Guild]] and get them to help harvest the materials...
:'''Paimon:''' A place with both Sweet Flowers and Whopperflowers... Hey, {{Traveler}}, we've been there before, didn't we already get both of those?
:'''Xuanji:''' *cough*... Really now... You already dealt with those Pyro Whopperflowers?
:'''Paimon:''' Sure, there were quite a few, but for pros like us, it was just a bit of weed-whacking.
:'''Xuanji:''' There were really quite a few, yes? Ah, no, no! Yes, yes, yours truly knows just how many there are! The two of you are truly both skilled and courageous! Please, allow me to express my admiration and undying respect!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! Looks like you've got no reason not to make us the special Fiery Explosive Sweet Nectar Tea now, right? Because we'd like to drink some, pronto!
:'''Xuanji:''' *ahem*... Yes... Your humble servant will prepare some posthaste...
:'''Xuanji:''' (Blasted... How do I even...? It can't be that hard, right!? It'll be fine if I just dump the Sweet Flowers and [[Whopperflower Nectar]] in together, right!?)
:{{Black Screen|Despite the reluctant look on Xuanji's face, he takes out the ingredients you brought and throws it all &mdash; lock, stock, and barrel &mdash; into a cup. After but the briefest moment of hesitation, he removes a small quantity, but in the end, puts it all back in.}}
:{{Black Screen|He then covers it with a lid, and begins shaking it vigorously. Soon after, a brown liquid with a strange foam floating on the surface is brought before you.}}
:{{Black Screen|You realize something isn't quite right, but Paimon picks it up and drains her cup in a single Paimonial gulp.}}
:'''Paimon:''' BLEEEECCCH!!! What the heck is that stuff!? Paimon's never drunk anything that terrible before... Just how does your tea stall manage to stay open...
:'''Xuanji:''' Ahaha...Ah! S&mdash;So sorry! I apologize for the torment inflicted upon your tongue, dear customer...
:'''Xuanji:''' Please take this, as a token of my sincerity! Consider it reparations for the crimes committed against your taste buds, and a reward for bringing me the materials...
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! Though your tea-brewing skills are pretty bad, you're pretty swell!
:'''Xuanji:''' Hehe, don't say that... Anyway, thanks to you two, your humble servant finally has all the necessary ingredients.
:'''Xuanji:''' Now, if you two don't have any other pressing matters about these parts, you should head back as soon as possible. After all, who knows what kind of dangers might be lurking out in the wild?

:'''Xuanji:''' As long as I get enough ingredients to reopen, who cares how big the reward I offer is? I'll make it all back and then some!
:'''Xuanji:''' 'Tis a shame... and embarrassing, to boot, but would you mind just hanging around elsewhere for a bit? I'm going to patter on off to the Adventurers' Guild and get them to help harvest the materials...
:{{DIcon}} Good news. We're the Adventurers you're looking for.
:'''Xuanji:''' Uh... *cough*... This, well...
:'''Paimon:''' That's right, and we've just gotta try that Explosive Sweet Nectar Tea! Just leave the ingredients to us.
:'''Xuanji:''' Th&mdash;The Whopperflowers there are as plentiful as the stones on Mt. Mingyuan! I'd caution against taking such a risk...
:'''Paimon:''' ...If there really are that many, shouldn't this place be called Whopperflower Mountain?
:'''Xuanji:''' Uh... Oh! I just remembered! I actually already have a contractual agreement with the Adventurers' Guild. If I simply allowed the two of you to just take over, it wouldn't be proper...
:'''Paimon:''' You're weird, you know that? Here you've got two readily available Adventurers right in front of you, ready to help, and yet you're backtracking...
:'''Xuanji:''' Anyway, though the tea is good, the timing isn't, hehe. I do hope you'll be back, dear customers.
:'''Paimon:''' Sure, sure.
:'''Paimon:''' (Hey, {{Traveler}}... Whaddaya say we ignore him and just go get the ingredients? We'll be able to try the tea then, right?)
:'''Paimon:''' (Paimon really wants to give that tea he talked up a try!)

;(Talk to Xuanji again)
:'''Xuanji:''' I can't believe you two haven't left yet. It's dangerous here, it's best not to tarry here too long.
:'''Xuanji:''' What is it? Still can't take your minds off the ho.... er, Fiery Explosive Sweet Nectar Tea?
:'''Xuanji:''' Such things are far too dangerous.

;(Defeat the Whopperflowers)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Guess there really are a bunch of Pyro Whopperflowers here! The teaseller wasn't lying after all.

;(Return to Xuanji)
:'''Xuanji:''' Ah? You... my dear customers, you...
:{{DIcon}} Here are the ingredients. Tea, please.
:'''Xuanji:''' What? Did you guys really deal with the {{Color|buzzword|Pyro Whopperflowers}}?
:'''Paimon:''' Sure, there were quite a few, but for pros like us, it was just a bit of weed-whacking.
:'''Xuanji:''' Quite a few? Ah, no, no! Yes, yes, yours truly knows just how many there are! The two of you are truly both skilled and courageous! Please, allow me to express my admiration and undying respect!
:'''Xuanji:''' (Good thing these two are okay... I'd lose my job otherwise... Looks like I'll need to try a different excuse next time...)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! Looks like you've got no reason not to make us the special Fiery Explosive Sweet Nectar Tea now, right? Because we'd like to drink some, pronto!
:'''Xuanji:''' *ahem*... Yes... Your humble servant will prepare some posthaste...

:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Fine. Guess you're still an alright person, although your tea-brewing skills are pretty bad...
:'''Xuanji:''' Hehe, don't say that... Anyway, thanks to you two, your humble servant finally has all the necessary ingredients.
:'''Xuanji:''' Now, if you two don't have any other pressing matters about these parts, you should head back as soon as possible. After all, who knows what kind of dangers might be lurking out in the wild?
