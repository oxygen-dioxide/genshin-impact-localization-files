==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tieshan:''' Greetings, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} About [[Rex Lapis]]' death...
:;(Unlocked after completing [[Rite of Descension]])
::'''Tieshan:''' Rex Lapis... You know, I saw him once, in a crowd. He was disguised as a commoner, so nobody noticed. But I could tell from the way he carried himself &mdash; everything about him was so dignified and graceful.
::'''Tieshan:''' How did I know it was him? To be honest, I can't know for sure...
::'''Tieshan:''' But I believe that everyone in Liyue can recognize the one who founded our nation and watched over us for millenia, even if just by his silhouette.
::'''Tieshan:''' I'm honestly still struggling to accept his death. Now I'll never know for sure whether it was really him...
:;(Before completing [[The Fond Farewell]])
:::'''Tieshan:''' We're not really supposed to discuss it to be honest. But if you can't get things off your chest... how can you expect to move on? *sigh* If anyone asks, though, we never had this conversation.
:;(After completing The Fond Farewell)
:::'''Tieshan:''' Still, I shouldn't tear myself up over it. The Rite of Parting went smoothly &mdash; and so may Rex Lapis' journey be.
:{{DIcon}} Where is this?
::'''Tieshan:''' Yuehai Pavilion. A landmark location in Yujing Terrace and also the place where the [[Qixing]] meet to discuss official matters.
::'''Tieshan:''' Unless you are here on business, you would be well advised to stay out.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a bit about yourself...
::'''Tieshan:''' My name is Tieshan. I'm a member of the Millelith, and I work to defend Liyue Harbor.
::'''Tieshan:''' Well, actually, I'm not from the city. Qingxu Pool's where my home is, thereabouts.
::'''Tieshan:''' Perhaps Rex Lapis has smiled upon my dutiful service, because after I heard the last round of divine predictions at the Rite of Descension...
::'''Tieshan:''' ...I tried helping my family to do some business on the side, and what do you know &mdash; actually had some small success.
::'''Tieshan:''' Recently, I've moved my family property to Chihu Rock, so I suppose I do count as a citizen of Liyue Harbor now. *chuckles*
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Tieshan:''' Farewell. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
