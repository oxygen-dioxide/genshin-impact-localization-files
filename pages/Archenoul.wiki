==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available prior to completing ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Archenoul:''' Hello there.
:'''Archenoul:''' I'm a diver employed by the Spina di Rosula, so I usually don't accept outside commissions. I hope you'll understand.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about diving...
::'''Archenoul:''' If people without Visions want to dive, they need to go through specialized training first, and they must be accompanied by a professional diver when they first go underwater.
::'''Archenoul:''' The underwater world is very beautiful, but never underestimate its potential dangers.
::'''Archenoul:''' For example, most people only pay attention to whether their diving equipment is intact and functional, but ignore their own physical condition.
::'''Archenoul:''' If you do not warm up before a dive, or if you cannot adapt to the water pressure in time, you can get muscle cramps or symptoms such as tinnitus.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it...
::'''Archenoul:''' Sure. See you.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Masquerade of the Guilty''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Archenoul:''' Hello.
:'''Archenoul:''' I'm the diver hired by Spina di Rosula, and I'm afraid I'm not taking any other commissions. My apologies.
:{{DIcon}} For rebuilding Poisson, right?
::'''Archenoul:''' Hmm... half-and-half.
::'''Archenoul:''' It's partly to clear out the junk in the water and perform underwater reconstruction work. And partly to recover everyone's belongings.
::'''Archenoul:''' Loads of valuables belonging to the citizens were washed away. It doesn't matter how much they're actually worth, but they all meant something.
::'''Archenoul:''' I'd like to help recover them, if I can.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Archenoul:''' Okay, goodbye.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Archenoul:''' Hello there.
:'''Archenoul:''' I'm a diver employed by the Spina di Rosula, so I usually don't accept private commissions. I hope you'll understand.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about diving...
::'''Archenoul:''' Specialized diving training is required for people without Visions, and they must be accompanied by a professional diver for their first dive.
::'''Archenoul:''' The underwater world is very beautiful, but never underestimate the dangers lurking within its depths.
::'''Archenoul:''' For example, most people only pay attention to whether their diving equipment is intact and functional, and they ignore their own physical condition.
::'''Archenoul:''' If you do not warm up before a dive, or if you cannot adapt to the water pressure in time, you may suffer from muscle cramps or other symptoms such as tinnitus.
:{{DIcon}} About the flood...
::'''Archenoul:''' The situation was bad back then, but it's all in the past now.
::'''Archenoul:''' This is exactly why I've constantly emphasized the necessity of regular diving equipment checks. It's so that we're always ready to deal with emergencies like this.
::'''Archenoul:''' Even though [[Navia]] said that the kind of disaster mentioned in the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophecy]] won't happen again, we should still pay attention to our safety.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Archenoul:''' Okay, goodbye.
