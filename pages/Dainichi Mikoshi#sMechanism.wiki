{{Lang|'''Dainichi Mikoshi'''|ja=大日御輿|ja_tl=Great Sun Mikoshi}} is an artificial sun that was created in the depths of [[Enkanomiya]] by [[Aberaku]]. It can be toggled on and off to control Enkanomiya's day and night, respectively called '''Whitenight''' and '''Evernight'''.

==Mechanism==
There is a type of special mechanism distributed throughout Enkanomiya, which can be activated after completing specific quests. These mechanisms are connected to the Dainichi Mikoshi and can be used to modify the day-night cycle to manually switch from Whitenight to Evernight and vice versa.
