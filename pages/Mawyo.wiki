==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Mawyo:''' To be an adventurer or travel with a caravan? Friend, please help me out!
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Mawyo:''' I'm a "freelancer." Just call me Mawyo.
::'''Mawyo:''' [[Hamawi|Dad]]'s been rattling a lot about what I'm doing, but I don't care. The benefits of being a freelancer are something those old fogeys like my dad and brother wouldn't understand.
::'''Mawyo:''' What to do, when to start, how much to earn... I call the shots. Isn't it amazing?
::{{DIcon}} Is the income stable?
::'''Mawyo:''' If you're a freelancer, you don't care about stability anymore.
::'''Mawyo:''' See, I can rest for a long time as soon as I make a pile with an expedition team or a caravan.
::'''Mawyo:''' It's easy to make a quick buck. With a little capital and a bit of luck, you can earn three months' money to pay for meals at the [[Kalimi Exchange]].
::'''Mawyo:''' Isn't this more proper than being an [[Akademiya]] researcher? I don't know what that old man is so worried about.
::'''Mawyo:''' Those [[Genius Invokation TCG|Invokation TCG]] cards command a ready market in Inazuma. I can trade those someday as well.
::'''Mawyo:''' And my dad and Brother [[Sal]] won't let me starve to death even if there isn't a gig for me at the moment. So, please rest assured.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I'm a little busy right now.
::'''Mawyo:''' You wouldn't happen to be planning for something big? Count me in!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Mawyo:''' Hello there! Buying coffee at night, aren't you? I guess you're a night owl just like me!
:{{DIcon}} You are a night owl, too?
::'''Mawyo:''' Of course I am! Nighttime is precious, and it'd be a waste if we didn't use it properly.
::'''Mawyo:''' Look at this coffee shop. It's a very popular one, and has provided me with a great deal of precious intel.
::'''Mawyo:''' Adventurers' commissions, clues to treasure maps, and business opportunities for new toys... Every piece of information contributes to my career as a freelancer.
::'''Mawyo:''' Well, although the tavern might be a better source of information, I just can't hold my liquor. So I have to give up on it.
:{{DIcon}} It's getting late. I should probably head back now.
::'''Mawyo:''' Okay then... Maybe we'll have the chance to talk more next time.
