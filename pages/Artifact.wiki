'''Artifacts''' are items in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that can be equipped on [[Character]]s to increase their [[Stats]]. It is the second tab in the [[Inventory]].

There are 5 types of Artifacts that can be equipped: {{Item|Flower of Life|30|type=Icon}}, {{Item|Plume of Death|30|type=Icon}}, {{Item|Sands of Eon|30|type=Icon}}, {{Item|Goblet of Eonothem|30|type=Icon}}, and {{Item|Circlet of Logos|30|type=Icon}}. Only one of each type can be equipped on a character at a time.

All Artifacts have a main affix, commonly known as a main stat, with up to 4 minor affixes, commonly known as sub stats or secondary stats. These affixes can greatly increase the character's strength in combat. Certain artifact types, such as the Flower of Life and Plume of Death, can only come with a specific [[Artifact/Stats|main stat]], while other types can come with one of many main stats.

==How to Obtain==
Artifacts can be obtained in the following ways:
* [[Investigation]] Spots
* [[Chests]]
* Destroying [[Tumbleweed]]s
* Defeating [[Elite Enemies]] and [[Bosses]]
* Claiming rewards from Petrified Trees in [[Domains of Blessing]]
* Acquiring [[Spiral Abyss/Chamber's Bounty|Chamber Bounties]] in the [[Spiral Abyss]]

At the highest Domain level, Artifact Domains averages at 1 5-Star featured artifact and 1.5 4-Star featured artifacts. Featured artifacts each have 50% to be either of the two types.

A maximum of 1,500 Artifacts can be in a player's [[Inventory]] at a time. If the player tries to collect another Artifact, a special notice will appear on-screen.

Some [[NPC]]s have dialogue branches that give the player one artifact. There are also [[Shops#Artifacts|NPCs who sell 2★ artifacts]].

==Equipping==
Artifacts can be equipped on characters from the [[Character]] > Artifacts > Switch Menu or the [[Inventory]] > Artifacts > Details > Fast Equip Menu.

==Enhancing==
{{Main|Artifact EXP}}
Artifacts require [[Artifact EXP]] and [[Mora]] to enhance. Artifact EXP can be acquired through [[Artifact EXP Materials]] or from using other Artifacts as Enhancement Materials.

1 point of EXP costs {{Item|Mora|20|x=1}} except when recycling an already-leveled artifact.

Upgrading a full set of 5{{star}} artifacts to level 20 will cost 270,475 × 5 = 1,352,375 Artifact EXP & [[Mora]].

==Destroying==
1-Star to 4-Star Artifacts can be destroyed for [[Mora]], and up to 100 Artifacts can be destroyed at a time. The Artifact must be at Level 0 (+0) with 0 EXP. The Mora received is 420/840/1260/2520 depending on the quality, which is equal to the Mora it would cost to use the [[Artifact EXP#Using Artifacts as Artifact EXP|Artifact as Artifact EXP]].

5-Star Artifacts cannot be destroyed for Mora, but they can be used on [[Mystic Offering]]s which will give back one [[Artifact Strongbox]].

==Artifact Sets==
{{Main|Artifacts/Sets}}
'''Artifact Sets''' are different kinds of artifacts that have different Set Bonuses depending on how many are of that set are equipped on a character.
{{Artifact List}}

==Stats==
{{Main|Artifacts/Stats}}
Each artifact has one main stat, determined by the artifact's type/slot. Its value at each level is determined by the stat and the artifact's quality. Main stats include HP, HP%, ATK, ATK%, DEF%, Elemental Mastery, Energy Recharge%, Elemental Damage Bonus% for each of the 7 playable [[Elements]], Physical DMG Bonus%, Crit Rate%, Crit DMG%, and Healing Bonus, but not all stats are available for all artifacts.

Along with the main stat, artifacts have up to 4 sub-stats that are all different from the main stat. For every 4 levels that an artifact gains, an additional sub-stat is added unless the artifact already has 4 sub-stats, in which case a random sub-stat is upgraded. Sub-stats include HP, HP%, ATK, ATK%, DEF, DEF%, Elemental Mastery, Energy Recharge%, Crit Rate%, and Crit DMG%.

==Lore==
Artifacts are manifestations of memories and ideals.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Sanctifying Essence}}</ref> Artifacts often take the form of items from bygone days, and their previous owners are usually described in the artifacts' descriptions.

==Trivia==
* The types of Artifacts (Flower, Plume, etc.) were inspired by {{w|Tarot|tarot cards}} and the poem "{{w|Auguries of Innocence}}" written by {{w|William Blake}}.<ref>bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/mobile?id=10739818 PASH! Interview]</ref>
