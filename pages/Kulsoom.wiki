{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ramiz:''' Grandma, may I ask you a question? [[Nawaz]] and I have been thinking about this one, but we still don't get it.
:'''Kulsoom:''' Oh, of course you can, dear.
:'''Ramiz:''' So, uh... Grandma, is King Deshret really gonna come back from the dead...?
:'''Kulsoom:''' ...!
:'''Ramiz:''' Grandma?
:'''Kulsoom:''' Those fanatic believers! Can't they spare the children!?
:'''Kulsoom:''' Child, please, listen well. Though gods are indeed very powerful, even they can disappear.
:'''Kulsoom:''' Being obsessed with things that have disappeared is madness. It is no way to live.
:'''Kulsoom:''' *sigh* If only the desert children had the chance to learn a little more. Then they wouldn't easily fall for such lies...
:'''Kulsoom:''' Child, I... I know this is a lot to ask, but please, study hard &mdash; you should learn a thing or two from [[Setaria]].
:'''Ramiz:''' I... I understand.
