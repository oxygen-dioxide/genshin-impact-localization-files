''Before completing [[Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ramiz:''' Grandma, may I ask you a question? [[Nawaz]] and I have been thinking about this one, but we still don't get it.
:'''Kulsoom:''' Oh, of course you can, dear.
:'''Ramiz:''' So, uh... Grandma, is King Deshret really gonna come back from the dead...?
:'''Kulsoom:''' ...!
:'''Ramiz:''' Grandma?
:'''Kulsoom:''' Those fanatic believers! Can't they spare the children!?
:'''Kulsoom:''' Child, please, listen well. Though gods are indeed very powerful, even they can disappear.
:'''Kulsoom:''' Being obsessed with things that have disappeared is madness. It is no way to live.
:'''Kulsoom:''' *sigh* If only the desert children had the chance to learn a little more. Then they wouldn't easily fall for such lies...
:'''Kulsoom:''' Child, I... I know this is a lot to ask, but please, study hard &mdash; you should learn a thing or two from [[Setaria]].
:'''Ramiz:''' I... I understand.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ramiz:''' Grandma, look, look! Sumeru City is just as lively as Setaria said!
:'''Kulsoom:''' But of course! Don't run too fast, or I might not be able to keep up, you know.
:'''Ramiz:''' Don't worry, I won't! There's so much to see here, I wanna take my time to take it all in.
:'''Kulsoom:''' Hehe... He's every bit as serious about having fun as he is about studying.
:'''Kulsoom:''' That's good, very good. Conscientious people are successful, no matter what they do.
:'''Ramiz:''' Grandma, can I ask you for another favor? Could you take me to the Akademiya?
:'''Kulsoom:''' Of course, of course! Still, it's uphill much of the way, so I might have to ask for your support too.
:'''Ramiz:''' No problem! Thank you so much, Grandma!
