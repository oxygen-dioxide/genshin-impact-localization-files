'''Outset of the Brave''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Brave Heart]].

==Description==
The young hero's first battle ended, and for the first time he tasted the sweet wine of victory.<br />That day, deep of the vine he drank together with his closest friend — supportive, joyful, and blissfully ignorant.

Many years later, when the cataclysm came, he led the knights to fight for his homeland.<br />On the eve of battle, he advised his childhood friend and long-time deputy to come drink with him.

"If you do not return, I will not mourn you."<br />"Nay, I will toast you, and drink in your honor, just as we do today."
