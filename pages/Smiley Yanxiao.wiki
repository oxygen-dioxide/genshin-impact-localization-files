==Profile==
Smiley Yanxiao was once a thief who attempted to steal from the [[Verr Goldet|boss]] of Wangshu Inn where he was beaten up and locked in. After getting bailed, Yanxiao became a chef in Wangshu Inn, a job which he now thinks to be better than being a thief.

===Personality===
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
While he is a sous-chef, he does not provide any services. He will often move around the kitchen to inspect and make foodstuffs, often disgruntled by the food in examination being 'too salty'.

[[Paimon]] initially considers him to be similar in personality to [[Wagner]], although he becomes much friendlier to the Traveler once they help solve his ghost problem. Despite his appearance, he is terrified of ghosts. He also enjoys working at the inn, considering his current employers to be lenient. While he is not fond of [[Jiangxue]] due to him being a freeloader at the inn, Smiley Yanxiao ensures that he has something to eat.

===Appearance===
Smiley Yanxiao is a tall and well-built man with rugged features, fair skin, and dark eyes. His hair is black, short, and spiky. He wears a brown vest over a short-sleeved white undershirt with a belt that is brown, caramel, and white in color. White bandages are wrapped around his forearms as well as his lower legs, below the hem of his brown capris. Matching brown wristbands are worn on both arms and he has black shoes with flax-colored soles.

===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Wangshu]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' What do you think you're doing? You can't just waltz into the kitchen whenever you feel like it!
:{{DIcon}} Wh-Who are you?
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I am Yanxiao, a sous-chef.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Unless you have something seriously urgent to tell me, you'd better get out of my kitchen.
::{{DIcon}} ...Just a sous-chef?
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' What's the big deal? Didn't you see me chopping meat and making a soup?
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' You're not the first person to show surprise at me working as a chef though.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' My story goes like this. I actually used to be a thief until I stole from the boss.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I took a beating for it and was locked up for a while.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' After I got out, the boss took me on to help out in the kitchen.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I find I'm much happier as a sous-chef than I was as a thief.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I feel like this is the real me.
:{{DIcon}} Bye-bye.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' See you later. Wait no &mdash; don't come back in here!

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Wangshu]].''
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Huh? What are you doing just sauntering on into the kitchen?
:{{DIcon}} Oh, sorry...
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' It's fine. Kindness should be repaid in kind and however it goes.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I'm hardly about to kick you out, not after you helped me with that ghost problem and all.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me a bit about your life to date.
:::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' What're you asking that for? Aren't you here to cook?
::;(Rest of the dialogue is the same as "...Just a sous chef?" from the second line onward)
::{{DIcon}} How've things been going lately?
:::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Pretty good. Ever since then, I've stopped seeing anything weird.
:::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' But even if something pops up again, I'll be fine. The boss met an exorcist called [[Chongyun]] through some friends.
:::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' If another ghost pops up, we'll call him in. Besides, they say he's pretty good at his job.
:{{DIcon}} Bye-bye.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Go well, eat well.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing Part II{{colon}} Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go)
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I might not have won this iteration of Masterful Chefs, but I definitely learned a lot from the competition itself!
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I was just planning to invent a few new dishes for the Moonchase Festival and maybe learn a few things from Chef Xiangling, but I sure learned quite a few unexpected things, too!
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' ...Actually, what are you doing, just sauntering on into the kitchen again?

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* While the English version added the nickname "Smiley" to make a satire more visible, his name {{Lang|Yanxiao|zh=言笑|zh_rm=Yánxiào}} literally means "talk and laugh." The word dates back to ancient times as seen in {{Lang|"[we] chatted and laughed harmoniously"|zh={{wt|言笑晏晏}}|zh_rm=yán xiào yàn yàn}}, a line of a poem collected in the ''{{w|Classic of Poetry}}'' (11th to 7th centuries BC), the oldest extant collection of Chinese poetry.
