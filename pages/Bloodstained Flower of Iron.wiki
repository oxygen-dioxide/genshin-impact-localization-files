{{Description|A dried flower stained black with blood and now as hard as steel. Probably some sort of a memento for its former master.}}
'''Bloodstained Flower of Iron''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Bloodstained Chivalry]].

==Description==
A common white flower given to the knight by a rescued damsel.<br />It is dried and hardened by the blood from all his bloodshed.

Thanking him for his valor, the damsel offered a reward.<br />He turned down all she gave, save for a pure white flower.

"For a knight, chivalry is its own reward."<br />"This flower shall be my medal. That is all I need."

He wore the flower upon his heart.<br />Like his armor, it was stained as black as a winter's night.<br />Like his heart, it was hardened like a tempered blade.
