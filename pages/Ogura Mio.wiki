==Profile==
Ogura Mio runs the Ogura Textiles & Kimonos within Inazuma City. She dearly misses her brother Yuu, who is currently in Kannazuka.

The [[Inazuma Commercial Street Bulletin Board#Ogura Textiles & Kimonos|Inazuma Commercial Street Bulletin Board]] has a posting from an anonymous frequenter of Ogura Textiles, who notes that the shop has been undergoing hard times. The person mentions her father's relationship to the [[Kujou Clan]] and tries to rally his samurai friends to come to the shop's aid. Mio, however, declines their generosity, which the person remarks was just like how her father would have responded.

==Dialogue==
===Before "Food From Afar"===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ogura Mio:''' Hello! Welcome to Ogura Textiles & Kimonos.
:'''Ogura Mio:''' The high-class silks from [[Liyue]] are still out of stock, but we have many new kimonos. Feel free to have a look.
:{{DIcon}} May I ask who you are?
::'''Ogura Mio:''' I am Ogura Mio, the owner of Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. Let me know if you need anything.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is a family-run store that has been around for a century. We sell high-class fabrics and the latest kimonos. Those upper-class samurai often come here as well. The quality of our merchandise is guaranteed.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' I see that you are not dressed commonly either. I'd wager that you've probably seen much. So, would you like to try out some Inazuma-style outfits?
:{{DIcon}} What's the issue with the silks from Liyue?
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Because of the [[Sakoku Decree]], many merchants engaged in international trade have been forced to shutter their businesses. The same goes for the import-export fabric industry.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' The dye houses of [[Ritou]] have closed down, and the dyes grown in [[Konda Village]] don't sell for good prices anymore.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Because of the difficulty in trading with Liyue, its price was driven up. It has also been out of stock for a long time, in any case.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' In the past, one could touch the silk weaved from [[Silk Flower]]s and have a sneak peek at the exotic lifestyle of the upper class in other lands. Now, I have almost forgotten what that smooth texture feels like...
::{{DIcon}} How's business?
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' Thank you for asking.
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' Although stocks of fabric are a bit tight, We are a storied and well-known store after all. Out items are excellent and have a good reputation.
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' Furthermore, my brother is a sergeant serving in the Shogun's Army, so we have the honor of offering our services to many officials of the [[Tenryou Commission]].
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' Most officers of the Tenryou Commission are high-class samurai, and they have many family members who often come here to purchase expensive, high-end kimonos. Our business is doing well thanks to them.
:::{{DIcon}} So, you mentioned your brother...
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' I have a samurai brother who is stationed afar and cannot return home yet.
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' Ever since my father's passing, the store that my brother should have been taking care of was left to me instead.
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' Although we cannot meet, we still keep writing to each other. I'm glad that we're aware of each other's well-being.
::{{DIcon}} Should have brought some from Liyue, I suppose.
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' Ah, have you been to Liyue before?
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' I was right after all. Judging from your outfit, I knew that you were a traveler from afar.
:::'''Ogura Mio:''' If you happen to come into possession of silk weaved from Silk Flowers at Liyue's [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]], we will be happy to buy them for a reasonable price.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you! Goodbye!
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Take care! Come back any time.
{{Dialogue end}}

===After "Food From Afar"===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ogura Mio:''' Oh my, if it isn't [[Kamisato Ayaka|Miss Kamisato]]'s friend?
:'''Ogura Mio:''' Long time no see. Please, come in.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to thank you again for that commission last time.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' You're welcome. It is the honor of Ogura Textiles & Kimonos to be able to make a customized outfit for Miss Kamisato.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' In any case, I rarely see Miss Kamisato so casual and happy. You two must be truly close friends.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Ah, seeing how you're so close to Miss Kamisato, I'm getting curious as to what your story is, my dear customer.
::{{DIcon}} I'm just a passing traveler.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' You jest again, dear customer... But since you insist on keeping it a secret, I will not pry.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Ogura Textiles & Kimonos will continue to count on you and Miss Kamisato for business.

:{{DIcon}} So how've things been going lately?
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
::'''Ogura Mio:''' It's still the same. The last time I got my hands on Liyue silk was when I was making that outfit for Miss Kamisato. My brother is also still somewhere far away...
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Ah, why am I saying these things to a customer? I'm sorry.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' On the upside, business has been good and my brother is safe, so everything is going well.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' If you ever run into my brother, please send him my regards. Thank you.

:{{DIcon}} How've things been going lately?
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
::'''Ogura Mio:''' With the trade routes re-opened, many customers have recently come to order silks. I have several pages' worth of names, in fact.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' If you're looking to buy any now, I'm afraid that you might have to wait a few months.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' *sigh* It's at times like these that I wish that my brother, stationed afar as he is, could return to help out...
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Ah, why am I saying these things to a customer? I'm sorry.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' If you ever run into my brother, please send him my regards. Thank you.

:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ogura Mio:''' Take care! Please send my regards to Miss Kamisato as well.
