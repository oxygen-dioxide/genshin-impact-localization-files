*The Electro Hypostasis can be interacted with before starting the quest, and gives the following dialogue up until it is defeated and disappears during the quest:
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Slumbering Monster:''' This creature seems to be related to the Electro Hypostasis you encountered before in Mondstadt, but it does not react at all as you approach. Perhaps it is in a deep slumber.
:'''Slumbering Monster:''' You know not what caused it to appear here, nor do you know when it will awaken... It may be safest to keep your distance for now.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|The shrine maiden Miyuki is currently having a massive headache over the abnormal state of the Thunder Sakura in Kannazuka...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Miyuki)
:'''Miyuki:''' Hmm? Ah, Traveler. What are you doing at a place like this at a moment like this? ...You really are an unlucky one, aren't you.
:'''Miyuki:''' If you came here to enjoy the view of the Sakura, now is categorically not the time, so please don't get your hopes up.
:'''Miyuki:''' We used to have a lot of visitors coming here for the Sakura, but no one wants to come here these days. Not with all the fighting going on.
:{{DIcon}} I didn't come for the Thunder Sakura.
::'''Miyuki:''' Oh so you just happened to be passing through? In that case, I'd rather warn you &mdash; the Thunder Sakura have been damaged. I went to inspect them earlier and something about them just didn't seem right.
:{{DIcon}} That's a bummer.
::'''Miyuki:''' It's a little more than a bummer. It's an absolute tragedy! Seeing the damaged condition that the Thunder Sakura are in fills my heart with grief.
::'''Miyuki:''' Also, when I went to inspect them earlier, something about them just didn't seem right.
:'''Miyuki:''' Don't get too close to the Thunder Sakura &mdash; it could be dangerous. Please, be careful.
:{{DIcon}} What's a Thunder Sakura?
:{{DIcon}} What's the big deal with Thunder Sakura?
:'''Miyuki:''' You don't know the first thing about them, do you? Small wonder, I suppose, since you're not from the shrine.
:'''Miyuki:''' You've probably seen the Sacred Sakura at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]]? That's a symbol of the Great Narukami's power. The Great Narukami is eternal, just as the Sacred Sakura will always in full bloom.
:'''Miyuki:''' Beyond the shrine, in [[Kannazuka]], you will find Thunder Sakura. They share a common origin with the Sacred Sakura and possess a similar power, too.
:'''Miyuki:''' Recently, however, the Thunder Sakura have been damaged, and they are not producing blossoms. It cannot be a good sign.
:'''Miyuki:''' It alarmed [[Yae Miko|Lady Miko]] enough that she sent me to Kannazuka to investigate.
:'''Miyuki:''' So far, I have discovered a group of Treasure Hoarders who keep showing up near the Thunder Sakura. They seem very suspicious to me, and I must find out what their connection is to all of this.
:'''Miyuki:''' However, I... Well to put it bluntly, I'd be hopeless in a fight, and these Treasure Hoarders look particularly fierce...
:'''Miyuki:''' Traveler, I'd ask you to investigate their camp and find out what they're up to.
:'''Miyuki:''' I initially thought that I'd be more than capable of handling the investigation on my own, but now... it's less straightforward than I'd imagined, so all I can do is ask for your help.
:'''Miyuki:''' Thank you, Traveler.

;(Talk to Miyuki again)
:'''Miyuki:''' Damage to the Thunder Sakura brings dishonor to the shrine. We urgently need to get to the bottom of this.
----
;(Investigate the Treasure Hoarders in front of an Electro Hypotasis)
:'''Paimon:''' Hah, we found the Treasure Hoarder camp! Wait a moment. That thing in there sure looks like the Electro Hypotases we've seen before.
;(Enter battle with the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Paimon:''' Here's a Treasure Hoarder camp, and they don't look like they're up to no good for once? So suspicious. Let's go ask one of them. Nicely, of course.
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... Guess we'll do this the normal way. Let's beat them all up, and ask the last guy some questions!

;(Talk to Hideaki after defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Hideaki:''' P&mdash;Please don't kill me! I had nothing to do with the Thunder Sakura, I swear!
:'''Paimon:''' Aaaand how did you know that we were here about the Thunder Sakura stuff? Guilty conscience, much?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon bets you got this Electro Hypostasis-like thingy from some dirty business, didn't you?
:'''Hideaki:''' Y&mdash;You... What's that got to do with you, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Well, it's my job.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! We've been asked to right wrongs and see justice done! Out with it, then! We'll have you tell us everything the Treasure Hoarders intend to do with the Thunder Sakura, and where you got this thing from.
:'''Paimon:''' If you don't talk, hehe, well, you'll taste the super formidable bite of this Traveler's sword!
:'''Hideaki:''' I&mdash;I'll talk! B&mdash;But it's not as if anyone cared about these trees anyway! Can't a man and his brothers make some money off their power?
:'''Hideaki:''' We had a big-shot buyer who was interested in these trees, and they even provided us with the means and tools to extract their power.
:'''Hideaki:''' As long as we did as they said and opened up a gap in those trees, we could use those tools to collect the Thunder Sakura's power.
:'''Hideaki:''' Then all we'd need to do was to direct that power into this crystal, and hey presto, we'd have something worth three [[Tenryou Commission]] mansions!
:'''Hideaki:''' They gave us a huge sum of money, too! Not a sum you small-timers could ever spend in your life!
:'''Hideaki:''' If you'll just let me go, I'll give you a share! Ten percent to you, and ninety to us. How's that sound?
:{{DIcon}} Too little, buddy.
:{{DIcon}} Dream on, kiddo.
:'''Hideaki:''' What? You know what, I'm done letting you get off easy. Once our buyer gets here, you'll be the one begging for mercy from Lord Hideaki over here!
:'''Paimon:''' You sure know how to talk big, eh?
:'''Hideaki:''' Listen, you cocky little imp! My brothers are coming here to rescue me any time now.
:'''Paimon:''' It doesn't matter who you call or how many. You won't touch a hair on Paimon's head before the Traveler sends you all running.
:'''Hideaki:''' Yamada, did you hear that? This little pipsqueak said that you can't hurt her! You gonna take that lying down?
:'''Paimon:''' Yamada? Who's that? Traveler, quick!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? There's no one there...

:'''Hideaki takes the opportunity to slip away...'''

:'''Paimon:''' Darn, Hideaki gave us the slip...!
:'''Paimon:''' But we've got enough info for now. Let's go tell that shrine maiden. That bit's more important.
----
;(Report back to Miyuki)
:'''Miyuki:''' Have you made any discoveries?
:{{DIcon}} About Hideaki...
:'''Miyuki:''' So that's what's going on... But Treasure Hoarders are just petty thieves. Could their juvenile antics really cause this much havoc?
:'''Miyuki:''' I suspect there must be other reasons why the Thunder Sakura are withering... I have my suspicions, but I can't say for sure...
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean?
:'''Miyuki:''' This is Kannazuka, where neither the Inazuman faith nor [[Sangonomiya Clan|Sangonomiya's]] has any influence.
:'''Miyuki:''' Ever since the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] was promulgated, conflict often breaks out here between the [[Shogun's Army]] and [[Watatsumi Army|the rebels]]. I don't think either side cares whether the Thunder Sakura become collateral damage in their war.
:'''Miyuki:''' To quote Lady Miko, "Honors and accolades are all these military types care about." They will not listen to reason.
:'''Miyuki:''' We were well prepared for this, but we hadn't expected the Thunder Sakura to be in quite as terrible a condition as they now are...
:'''Miyuki:''' Anyway, here and now, the most pressing matter is to put a stop to the Treasure Hoarder's juvenile antics. Traveler, can I entrust this to you?
:{{DIcon}} You got it!
::'''Miyuki:''' Please don't get careless. The Thunder Sakura being weakened makes the situation very dangerous indeed. After all, these trees serve to suppress the one who lies beneath...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds straightforward enough.
::'''Miyuki:''' I fear it may not be as straightforward as you presume. The Thunder Sakura being weakened makes the situation very dangerous indeed. After all, these trees serve to suppress the one who lies beneath...
:'''Miyuki:''' Ah, I've said too much... P&mdash;Please forget you heard me say that. In short, please exercise extreme caution.
:'''Miyuki:''' I also need some time to work though my findings. One major outstanding question is: Who is directing the Treasure Hoarders behind the scenes?
:'''Miyuki:''' This case is becoming more and more complicated...

;(Talk to Miyuki again)
:'''Miyuki:''' Actually, do you know where the Thunder Sakura are?
:'''Miyuki:''' ...Looking at your reaction, I guess you're unfamiliar with the Thunder Sakura's locations. Well, you are a Traveler from abroad. I should have guessed as much.
:'''Miyuki:''' The five Thunder Sakura trees are not difficult to find. You just have to follow {{Color|buzz|the western shoreline}} from the {{Color|buzz|northernmost point}} of the Kujou Encampment islet to {{Color|buzz|northernmost point of Tatarasuna}} &mdash; you'll encounter three of them that way.
:'''Miyuki:''' As for the other two, one is on the mountain {{Color|buzz|northwest of Tatarasuna}}, the other is on another mountain to the {{Color|buzz|southwest}}.
:'''Miyuki:''' Knowing the directions should make things easier for you. I'll leave the matter of the Thunder Sakura to you. Please be careful.
{{Dialogue end}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|You decide to help the shrine maiden Miyuki save the Thunder Sakura. To this end, you have to find the five Thunder Sakura trees in {{Color|buzz|Kannazuka}}. They are currently imperiled, and you must {{Color|buzz|observe}} them closely to find a way to solve the issue. If you meet with any trouble, you can go consult Miyuki...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach a Thunder Sakura for the first time)
:'''Paimon:''' We're in danger of being struck by lightning just by being around here! This is no way to get close to the Thunder Sakura - we've gotta find a way to {{Color|buzz|turn that lightning off}}.
:'''Paimon:''' But we can't see the source of the lightning at all... Well, if our normal eyes won't help, how about {{Color|buzz|Elemental Sight}}?

;(Turn off a Thunder Sakura's lightning for the first time)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, look, the Thunder Sakura is blooming! It's just a few flowers now, but that's gotta be a good sign.

;(Remove "juvenile antics" for the first time)
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Retrieve Foreign Object
:'''Paimon:''' The scar on that tree looks awful. And there's something strange leaking out it, too...
:'''Paimon:''' That must be what the Treasure Hoarders are using to siphon the Thunder Sakura's energy. If we remove the foreign object from inside, it should heal on its own.

;(Approach the remaining Thunder Sakura trees)
:'''Paimon:''' Use your {{Color|buzz|Elemental Sight}} to have a look. You might be able to find the source of the lightning!

;(Remove "juvenile antics" for the remaining Thunder Sakura trees)
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Retrieve Foreign Object
:'''Paimon:''' The Thunder Sakura should heal itself now.
----
;(Report back to Miyuki)
:'''Miyuki:''' How is the situation with the Thunder Sakura?
:{{DIcon}} The "juvenile antics" have been dealt with.
:'''Miyuki:''' Wonderful, that will at least stabilize the condition of the Thunder Sakura. I'm sure Lady Miko will also be relieved.
:'''Miyuki:''' How dare these crooks brazenly seek to steal the power of the Thunder Sakura for their own gain. Their actions are unforgivable.
:'''Miyuki:''' You also mentioned that the Treasure Hoarders have some sort of crystal cube at their camp with which they're trying to collect the Thunder Sakura's power? That is incredibly dangerous... It must be dealt with as soon as possible.
:'''Miyuki:''' You've already helped me out enormously, so I couldn't possibly ask you to deal with this all by yourself once again. I will join you this time.
:'''Miyuki:''' There's no time to delay. Let's go.
;(Miyuki leaves)
:'''Paimon:''' Miyuki, wait up! ...Ugh, let's go catch up with her.
{{Dialogue end}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|The abnormalities on the Thunder Sakura have been dispelled, all that remains is cleanup work...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Investigate the Treasure Hoarder camp again)
:'''Hideaki:''' Hmph. So it's a meddling maiden from the shrine getting in the way of our money-making.
:'''Miyuki:''' Money-making? You scoundrels. How dare you have designs on the Thunder Sakura. Lady Miko will not let you off easy.
:'''Hideaki:''' Pah! Big talk, but you're forgetting who you're messing with!
:'''Hideaki:''' Master, that Traveler over there's the one who's been getting in your way. Our deal's gonna be in jeopardy if you don't help us out here!
:'''Fatui Skirmisher:''' Hehe. You're going to act though in front of me, small fry?

;(Defeat the Fatui)
:'''Hideaki:''' Ugh! Just my luck, bumping into this kind of opposition.
:'''Miyuki:''' You shameless villains. Conspiring with the Fatui... the Great Narukami will strike you all down sooner or later.
:'''Hideaki:''' Huh! Don't you go thinking you've got the best of me just because you successfully interfered in my business. I still have an ace up my sleeve!
;(Hideaki awakens the Slumbering Monster)

;(The boss fight begins)
:'''Hideaki:''' I'll leave this thing to finish you off. Meanwhile I'm outta here!
:'''Miyuki:''' I'm not about to let you get away after desecrating the Thunder Sakura! Traveler, you take this fight, I'm going after him.
----
;(Defeat the revived Electro Hypostasis)
:'''Hideaki:''' S&mdash;Stop chasing me, please... We've run this loop three times. I can barely walk...
:'''Miyuki:''' You lowlifes, consorting with outlanders for profit! There would be no mercy for you, even if we ran another ten rounds.
:'''Miyuki:''' Phew... From the relaxed look on your face, Traveler, I assume you've dealt with that little problem. Thank you very much.
:'''Miyuki:''' The Thunder Sakura's power cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of these types, much less be handed over to the Fatui in the shadows.
:'''Miyuki:''' It is hard to say what the Fatui have planned, but since we've captured this little lackey of theirs, I will be sure to get some answers from him.
:'''Miyuki:''' Leave the cleanup to me. The Shogun's Army's positions are well known to me. This man will not escape.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
*The fight with the Electro Hypostasis in this World Quest is the same as the [[Pure Electro Hypostasis]] from the [[Hypostatic Symphony]] event.
* A group of Fatui Skirmishers can be found on a cliff west of Mondstadt's Electro Hypostasis, though Cape Oath otherwise has no Fatui presence. While this group of Fatui have not had any story importance, their presence in the vicinity of the Hypostasis may tie into the Fatui's plans for the Slumbering Monster here.
