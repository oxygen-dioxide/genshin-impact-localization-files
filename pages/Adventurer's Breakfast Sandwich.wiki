|description     = A nutritious egg dish.
|desc_suspicious = The congealed mayonnaise is almost solid, and it is lined with tough ham and over-boiled egg. At least wolfing it down will make you full all the same.
|desc_basic      = Luxurious mayonnaise sits atop a lining of ham and poached egg toast. The smooth mouthfeel fills you with energy for the long road ahead, and is one of the Adventurers' Guild's top-rated breakfasts.
|desc_delicious  = The mayonnaise rises like the sun over the rippling poached egg's surface, and the exquisite mouthfeel really hits the spot. The unique salty flavor of the ham cuts right through the mix as well, like light parting the gathered clouds.
