:'''Citrouillard:''' Please, Coach... I&mdash;I can't... If I c&mdash;could just rest for a moment...
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Citrouillard:''' I&mdash;I'm fine! I j&mdash;just need to catch my breath... I'm a m&mdash;merchant. I'm not used to w&mdash;working out so hard...
::'''Citrouillard:''' Phew, the training classes here are way more intense than I expected...
::'''Citrouillard:''' I thought I was signing up for a standard weight loss class. You know, some basic aerobics, a lecture or two on good nutrition... I never thought it would be this vigorous!
::'''Citrouillard:''' But I can't quit now &mdash; I've already pre-paid! I even bought a VIP membership... If only I'd known it would be this grueling, I'd have gone with my sister to the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]...
::{{DIcon}} Sister?
::'''Citrouillard:''' Yes, my sister and I are merchants from [[Fontaine]]. We're hoping to make some investments in Natlan.
::'''Citrouillard:''' She left me on my own and headed to the Masters of the Night-Wind. Apparently, she met some "Master [[Chicome]]" there and received some investment tips. She tells me she's made quite the profit.
::'''Citrouillard:''' Although, I have no idea how she's done it... That priest, [[Kabewa]], she's from the Masters of the Night-Wind too, and she says they never give out investment tips to anyone. But... as long as she's turning a profit, who am I to complain?
:{{DIcon}} Good luck.
::'''Citrouillard:''' Thanks for your encouragement! I've already paid for a VIP membership, so I'll see this through no matter what!
