==Gameplay Notes==
* The Skypiercing Might effect is a unique character buff that appears as a blue glow around the weapon holder.
* The [[Version 1.0]] description of the buff was mistranslated &mdash; in reality, it adds another {{Color|Physical DMG}} hit to Normal and Charged ATKs, similar to how [[Crescent Pike]] works. The description has thus been changed to reflect this since [[Version 1.3]].
* The buff lasts 12 seconds and will remain active for the entire duration even if the holder of the weapon is switched out.
* The {{Color|Physical DMG}} hit bonus benefits from {{Color|Physical DMG Bonus}} and can also critically strike.
* The buff effect does not apply to other team members.

==Description==
The sky-piercing fang.<br>
It once pierced the black-gold scales of the kingdom of the abyss,<br>
and cut the throats of the sons of [[Gold|ancient sinners]].

[[Mondstadt]] was once threatened by the shadow dragon [[Durin]].<br>
Its jealousy for Mondstadt's prosperity begot evil, poisoning the land.<br>
In those dark days, Mondstadt was surrounded by monsters and barren lands.<br>
Hearing the people's cry for help, the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]] descended and awoke [[Dvalin]].<br>
Dvalin rode the wind and soared up to the sky, fighting for all life.

Blessed by the Anemo Archon, Dvalin fought the shadow dragon.<br>
Clouds broke, and the sky burned red as if the end of days was upon Mondstadt.<br>
Eventually, Dvalin's blessed fangs pierced through the throat of Durin.<br>
Durin fell, but Dvalin was poisoned by Durin's tainted blood.

Unable to bear the pain, Dvalin fell unconscious.<br>
Even the most learned bards knew not where he slumbered.<br>
Centuries passed, and Dvalin's sacrifice was all but forgotten by Mondstadt.<br>
When Dvalin finally awoke, gone was his friend and the sound of his comforting lyre.<br>
And the ones he once protected now cowered in fear at the sight of him.

Honor reclaimed, poison cleansed,<br>
Ballads shall give back a people's forgotten memory.<br>
A prayer, this sword is. May Dvalin's name be restored.
