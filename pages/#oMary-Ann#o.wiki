==Profile==
During the conflict within the remains of [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]] 400-500 years ago, [[Mary-Ann Guillotin]] (the human) was gravely wounded. In her final moments, the Oceanid [[Lyris]] dissolved her and absorbed her consciousness, creating the hybrid Oceanid "Mary-Ann". "Mary-Ann" then returned to [[Annapausis]], taking on the human Mary-Ann's appearance. Eventually, she would unintentionally created [[Ann]], a young Oceanid, with parts of her memories and dreams.

===Appearance===
"Mary-Ann" appears as a young woman with fair skin, bright blue eyes, and mid-length blue hair. She dons a blue-and-white dress decorated with frills, lace, and criss-crossing ribbons at the back, as well as white sandals, a simple neck ribbon, and blue bracelets.

Her blue features and her [[Hydro]]-affected body (when viewed with [[Elemental Sight]]) are indicators of her Oceanid nature, similar to [[Hydro Eidolon]]s that take the form of humans.

==Story==
===History===
During the conflict between the [[Marechaussee Hunter]]s and the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]] within the remains of [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]] 400-500 years ago, [[Mary-Ann Guillotin]] was gravely wounded by the explosion. In her final moments, the Oceanid [[Lyris]] dissolved her and absorbed her consciousness, creating "Mary-Ann", a hybrid Oceanid with a fused consciousness.

After the battle, Mary-Ann was presumed deceased. "Mary-Ann" constructed the dream world of [[Annapausis]], hiding herself within a fairy tale that the human Mary-Ann had told Lyris many years ago<ref>Interactable: [[Annapausis#Interactables|A Story]]</ref> to avoid confronting the harsh reality of all that had happened, and waiting for everyone else from the Institute to return. As a result of this dream, "Mary-Ann" accidentally created the Oceanid [[Ann]], who possesses the memories of both the real Mary-Ann and Lyris, while acting in the role of the hero that Mary-Ann Guillotin dreamed herself to be in the fairy tale.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Search in the Algae Sea (Quest)}}</ref>

===Present===
After entering [["The Real Annapausis"]], Ann, [[Paimon]], and the [[Traveler]] encounter a person who calls herself "Mary-Ann". Over the course of their conversation, the three realize that not all is as it seems, and the Traveler deduces that the entire adventure they had experienced was all a "story" &mdash; one presumably based on the original Mary-Ann's life experiences, including her days of play-acting at the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]]. After they realize this, "Mary-Ann" sends them away, telling them that her story has already ended.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Mary-Ann's Story}}</ref>

During the events of [[Rowboat's Wake (Quest)|''Rowboat's Wake'']], the newly defeated [[Narzissenkreuz]] helps Ann and the Traveler to once again find "Mary-Ann". Though "Mary-Ann" wishes to be left alone for eternity in the fairytale-like world she had constructed for herself in Annapausis, the Traveler uses the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz to destroy the illusion and bring her back to reality. "Mary-Ann" forgives Rene &mdash; now in the form of Narzissenkreuz &mdash; for all he had done and finally accepts the past, promising to live on as herself in the real world. She then sets out on a journey to explore the world together with Ann, Seymour, and [[Mamere]], the [[Melusine]] Seymour had befriended in the years after the battle in Elynas.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rowboat's Wake (Quest)}}</ref>
