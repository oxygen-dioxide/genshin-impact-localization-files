{{Description|A bountiful harbor that lies in the east of [[Teyvat]]. Mountains stand tall and proud alongside the stone forest, that, together with the open plains and lively rivers, make up Liyue's bountiful landscape, which shows its unique beauty through each of the four seasons. Just how many gifts from the Geo God lie in wait amongst the rocks of Liyue's mountains?|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Genshin Impact Official Website]}}

==Notable Features==
Liyue features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards:

===The Chasm===
* Five [[Bedrock Key]]s are found in the aboveground part of [[The Chasm]] which must be destroyed to break the seal over the [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|Underground Mines]] in the {{Quest|Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering}}. The player must charge each nearby [[Cage-Shaped Geo Formation]] using [[Geogranum|Geograna]], then attack the formation to strike the key. The key is destroyed when this has been done with all the nearby formations.
* [[Dangerous Gas]] reacts with {{Electro}} and {{Pyro}}, producing an explosion, while {{Anemo}} temporarily dissipates it.
* [[Exploding Geo Mushroom]]s ''(unofficial name)'' explode after a short delay, sometimes destroying nearby structures. The player and enemies will incur damage if they are near one when it explodes. 
* The {{Item|Lumenstone Adjuvant}} is obtained during the {{Quest|Chasm Spelunkers}}. When equipped and energized, it lights the player's surroundings in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] and enables certain actions. The Adjuvant is disabled if unequipped or drained of energy.
** The Adjuvant's energy is quickly recharged to full when the player stands next to certain objects with the Adjuvant equipped:
*** [[Teleport Waypoint]] (when activated)
*** [[Ruin Brazier]] (if unlocked)
*** [[Lumenlamp]] (if unlocked)
*** [[Luminous Seelie]]
** Other actions can restore a limited amount of energy to the equipped Adjuvant:
*** Interacting with [[Concentrated Lumenstone Energy]] ''(unofficial name)''
*** Breaking glowing ore rocks
*** Killing {{Item|Bluethunder Weasel|text=Bluethudner Weasels}}
*** Catching {{Item|Lucklight Fly|text=Lucklight Flies}}
*** Collecting {{Item|Starshroom|text=Starshrooms}}
** Some objects may be surrounded by a blue seal, which require spending 1 energy with the Adjuvant to unlock it before the player can interact with it:
*** [[Chest]]
*** [[Lumenlamp]]
*** [[Ruin Brazier]]
*** [[Time Trial Challenge]]
** [[Lumentorch]]es ''(unofficial name)'' can be activated when approached by the player stands nearby with the energized Adjuvant equipped, or by a [[Luminous Seelie]]. This does not cost any of the Adjuvant's energy. Lighting all nearby Lumentorches unlocks a chest.
** [[Dark Mud]] quickly drains energy from the Adjuvant while inhibiting [[Sprinting]] and sapping the player's [[HP]]. Enemies within it gain [[ATK]] and [[Resistance]] to all [[DMG]]. If an [[Oozing Concretion]] is found within a patch of mud, a sufficiently upgraded Adjuvant can be used to destroy it, which will disperse the mud and potentially reveal objects it covered. Oozing Concretions and their associated Dark Mud respawn with the next [[Reset]].
** The [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[Secret Messages in The Chasm]]'' requires the player to locate and interact with nine glowing rune phrases on the walls. A rune phrase will disappear if the player nears it with the Adjuvant equipped and energized, preventing interaction. The player must unequip or drain the Adjuvant first.
** The Adjuvant can be upgraded by bringing {{Item|Lumenspar}} and {{Item|Lumenstone Ore}} to [[Jinwu]].
* [[Lumencage]]s ''(unofficial name)'' can be attacked to fire projectiles to destroy nearby targets.
* [[Mine Passageway]]s ''(unofficial name)'' can be found that allow the player to travel between a point in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] and an above-ground location in [[Teyvat]].
* A special type of [[Pressure Plate]] is found here that requires the player to touch a sequence of points to unlock a chest.
* A [[Spoutrock]] drastically increases the player's jumping height when they stand on it and momentarily prevent [[Fall Damage]].
* [[Unique Rock]]s can be broken by the reverberations that come from a [[Unique Rock Pillar]] when attacked. [[Geo Construct]]s propagate these reverberations, allowing the player to extend their range.

===Chenyu Vale===
[[Fujin]] grants the player the ability to use adeptal energy on first entering [[Chenyu Vale]]. An object which can be manipulated or used with adeptal energy has a leaping carp icon over it that turns yellow when the player is facing it and is in range. Pressing the corresponding button will cause the player to interact with that object.

* Certain objects can be repositioned to solve puzzles, including pieces of masonry (as part of the [[Millennia of History]] mechanic), [[Carefree Simulacrum|Carefree Simulacra]], and [[Jade Cascade]] hairpins (the latter occurring in the {{Quest|An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade}}).
* [[Flighty Simulacrum|Flighty Simulacra]] allow a nearby player to jump to great heights, similar to [[Spoutrock]]s.
* [[Golden Carp's Leap]] is an exploration mechanic where the player can use adeptal energy on special floating water pearls to transform into a golden carp and fly to the pearl's location. From there, the player can fly a short distance in any direction before turning back into their original form.
** [[Wrathful Simulacrum|Wrathful Simulacra]] act similarly to water pearls, but also allow the player to deploy their own water pearls anywhere they like within a certain radius.
** There are also special pearls that cause the player's golden carp to fly on a predetermined path, but these must be interacted with directly in the typical fashion rather than at a distance with adeptal energy.
* Interacting with a [[Jade Incense Cauldron]] using adeptal energy causes the orb within to fly to the player, or back to the cauldron if the player already has the orb. Censers near the orb's flight path will be temporarily lit. Light all nearby censers at once to solve the puzzle.
* Large [[Lotus Lantern]]s light up smaller lanterns within a certain radius. Adeptal energy can be used to pick up and reposition the large lantern. The smaller lanterns remain lit for a brief time after leaving the large lantern's radius of influence. Light all nearby smaller lanterns at once to solve the puzzle. 
* [[Strange Phenomenon: Miasma|Miasma]] affects nearby monsters, making them more violent. Miasma encounters come in three waves; in each wave, the player must defeat the leader of the group of monsters, then interact with the miasma source using adeptal energy to purify it.

===Other===
* [[Adeptus Bridge]]s are golden, ribbon-like structures that the player can walk on to cross over gaps, usually found in the abodes of [[Adeptus|Adepti]]. Some can be activated, deactivated, or rotated using nearby activation points.
* [[Amber Rock]]s are [[Geo Construct]]s found at [[Mt. Hulao]]. Breaking them open releases a trapped object inside, which may be wildlife, an enemy, or a [[Common Chest]]. Ambers regenerate periodically, and their contents are random each time. Once a chest is collected from a particular amber, it will never produce a chest again.
* {{Item|Geoculus|text=Geoculi}} can be offered at [[Statue of The Seven|Statues of the Seven]] in Liyue for rewards.
* [[Geo Lamp]]s can be lit by standing next to one while holding a [[Geogranum]]. Lighting all nearby Geo Lamps triggers an effect.
* [[Plaustrite Platform]]s ''(unofficial name)'' are floating platforms which are usually part of a puzzle. Some are static, while others may appear or move in response to some interaction.

==Trivia==
[[File:Liyue Latin "Motto".png|150px|thumb|Screenshot from [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]]]
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''[[Farewell, Archaic Lord]]'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Ruat caelum fiat pactum''," which roughly means "Though the heavens fall, let the contract be made," and is modified from the phrase ''{{w|fiat justitia ruat caelum}}''.
* Liyue is the most prosperous of the seven regions.
* As of [[Chapter I]], Liyue is the only region to ostensibly not have a ''ruling'' archon at all, after Morax faked his death in the quest ''[[Rite of Descension]]''.

===Etymology===
* Liyue ({{zh|璃月|rm=Líyuè|tl=}}) literally means "Glazed Moon" in Chinese. In addition, miHoYo has also offered "Jade Moon" as a viable translation, using the radical of {{zh|玉}} (jade) in Liyue's ''Li'' {{zh|璃}}.
* Liyue's ''Li'' ({{zh|璃}}) can be decomposed into {{zh|王|rm=wáng|tl=king}} and {{zh|离|rm=lí|tl=departure}}, which is the same ''li'' found in [[Zhongli]]'s name in Simplified Chinese. The ''yue'' ({{zh|月}}) in Liyue can also mean "month," therefore, Liyue's name could possibly have a secondary meaning: "The Month of the King's Departure," which bears striking similarity to a possible interpretation of Zhongli's name ("time of departure").
*{{zh|璃月|rm=Líyuè}} is a near homophone of {{zh|礼乐|rm=lǐyuè|tl=rites and music}}, a word that represents the {{w|Confucianism|Confucian}} aspect of the traditional Chinese philosophy and culture.<ref name="liyue-zhidu">{{w|zh:礼乐制度|Chinese Wikipedia: 礼乐制度}}</ref> {{w|Li (Confucianism)|Lǐ}} (rite/courtesy) is a visible practice to maintain the order of both a human society and the universe, since the orders of human, terrestrial, and celestial realms are considered to be connected in the Chinese philosophy. {{w|Classic of Music|Yuè}} (music) symbolizes the cultural harmony of a society.<ref name="liyue-zhidu" />
*{{zh|璃月|rm=Líyuè}} is also a near homophone of {{Lang|"establishing a contract"|zh=立约|rm=lìyuē}}.
* In-game lore defines the country {{Lang|Liyue|zh=璃月|zh_rm=Líyuè}} to be established in Guili Plain before the Archon Wars while the Morax's mortal name "Zhongli" was chosen after the Seven. Thus the in-game etymology of "Liyue" leads to deeper lore.
** In Xiao's Story [[Xiao/Lore#Ode to Windborne Wraith|"Ode to Windborne Wraith"]], the book "Tour of the Land of Liyue" {{Lang|zh=琉璃岩间国土纪行|zh_lit=Tour of the Land among the Rock of Glaze}} written by Sumeru Akademiya was renamed as "Hidden Diamond and Cloudy Moon: Wonders and Folklores of Liyue" {{Lang|zh=匣中琉璃云间月|zh_lit=Glaze in the Box, Moon among the Clouds}} in Liyue. {{zh|琉璃|tl=glaze}} and {{zh|月|tl=moon}} are the two main elements in the etymology of Liyue.
***[[Qingzhou]] translates the phrase {{zh|匣中琉璃云间月|lit=Glaze in the Box, Moon among the Clouds}} as "As man hides Li in a box, so nature hides Yue between the clouds," and explains that "Li" is a "precious ceramic ornament" and "Yue" refers to the moon.
** Deeper lore connects to the sword [[Lion's Roar]] {{Lang|zh=匣里龙吟|zh_tl=Dragon's Roar in the Box}}. Lion's Roar is inspired by a famous poem {{Lang|zh=古剑篇|zh_tl=Tale of the Ancient Sword}},<ref>Gushien [https://so.gushiwen.cn/shiwenv_30239239f544.aspx 古剑篇]</ref> which describes the casting of an ancient sword which "like a white lotus spit out from a glazed jade box, the golden ring on the hilt of the sword is dyed with the brilliance of the sun and the moon" {{Lang|zh=琉璃玉匣吐莲花，错镂金环映明月}}. This is the most likely in-game etymology of "Liyue."

===Cultural References===
* Liyue is inspired by China.
* Liyue Harbor is said to be an economical center, similar to many port cities in China.
*Morax, the founder of Liyue, quotes some proverbs from the ''{{w|Analects}}'' of Confucius in a (non-canon) official blog post.<ref>HoYoverse Chinese News: [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/13126 {{zh|提瓦特美食札记 “展信佳。”&mdash;&mdash;钟离生日快乐}}]</ref>
*[[Divine Body from Guyun]] says a variety of different ideals were born and died during the [[Archon War]], where Liyue survived the war. It may be a reference to the {{w|Hundred Schools of Thought}} during the {{w|Warring States period}} of Ancient China, where the Confucian philosophy of "Liyue" (Rites and Music) survived the war in academia.
