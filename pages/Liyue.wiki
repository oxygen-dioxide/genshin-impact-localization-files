{{Description|A bountiful harbor that lies in the east of [[Teyvat]]. Mountains stand tall and proud alongside the stone forest, that, together with the open plains and lively rivers, make up Liyue's bountiful landscape, which shows its unique beauty through each of the four seasons. Just how many gifts from the Geo God lie in wait amongst the rocks of Liyue's mountains?|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Genshin Impact Official Website]}}
{{Lang|'''Liyue'''|zh=璃月|zh_rm=Líyuè}} is one of the seven regions in [[Teyvat]]. It is the city-state that worships [[Morax|Rex Lapis]], the [[Geo]] [[Archon]].

Access to Liyue is unlocked after completing the [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]]: Act I - [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]].

Archon Quest [[Chapter I]]: Farewell, Archaic Lord takes place in this region.

==Trivia==
* Liyue is the most prosperous of the seven regions.
* There is an area called Yilong Port in Liyue.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Symbol of Felicitation}}</ref> Its location is currently unknown.
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''[[Farewell, Archaic Lord]]'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Ruat caelum fiat pactum''," which roughly means "Let the contract be made, though the heavens fall," and is modified from the phrase ''{{w|fiat justitia ruat caelum}}''.
* As of [[Chapter I]], Liyue is the only region to ostensibly not have a ''ruling'' archon at all, after Morax faked his death in the quest ''[[Rite of Descension]]''.

===Etymology===
* Liyue ({{zh|璃月|rm=Líyuè|tl=}}) literally means "Glazed Moon" in Chinese. In addition, miHoYo has also offered "Jade Moon" as a viable translation, using the radical of {{zh|玉}} (jade) in Liyue's ''Li'' {{zh|璃}}.
* Liyue's ''Li'' ({{zh|璃}}) can be decomposed into {{zh|王|rm=wáng|tl=king}} and {{zh|离|rm=lí|tl=departure}}, which is the same ''li'' found in [[Zhongli]]'s name in Simplified Chinese. The ''yue'' ({{zh|月}}) in Liyue can also mean "month," therefore, Liyue's name could possibly have a secondary meaning: "The Month of the King's Departure," which bears striking similarity to a possible interpretation of Zhongli's name ("time of departure").
*{{zh|璃月|rm=Líyuè}} is a near homophone of {{zh|礼乐|rm=lǐyuè|tl=rites and music}}, a word that represents the {{w|Confucianism|Confucian}} aspect of the traditional Chinese philosophy and culture.<ref name="liyue-zhidu">{{w|zh:礼乐制度|Chinese Wikipedia: 礼乐制度}}</ref> {{w|Li (Confucianism)|Lǐ}} (rite/courtesy) is a visible practice to maintain the order of both a human society and the universe, since the orders of human, terrestrial, and celestial realms are considered to be connected in the Chinese philosophy. {{w|Classic of Music|Yuè}} (music) symbolizes the cultural harmony of a society.<ref name="liyue-zhidu" />
*{{zh|璃月|rm=Líyuè}} is also a near homophone of {{Lang|"establishing a contract"|zh=立约|rm=lìyuē}}.
* In-game lore defines the country {{Lang|Liyue|zh=璃月|zh_rm=Líyuè}} to be established in Guili Plain before the Archon Wars while the Morax's mortal name "Zhongli" was chosen after the Seven. Thus the in-game etymology of "Liyue" leads to deeper lore.
** In Xiao's Story [[Xiao/Lore#Ode to Windborne Wraith|"Ode to Windborne Wraith"]], the book "Tour of the Land of Liyue" {{Lang|zh=琉璃岩间国土纪行|zh_lit=Tour of the Land among the Rock of Glaze}} written by Sumeru Akademiya was renamed as "Hidden Diamond and Cloudy Moon: Wonders and Folklores of Liyue" {{Lang|zh=匣中琉璃云间月|zh_lit=Glaze in the Box, Moon among the Clouds}} in Liyue. {{zh|琉璃|tl=glaze}} and {{zh|月|tl=moon}} are the two main elements in the etymology of Liyue.
***[[Qingzhou]] translates the phrase {{zh|匣中琉璃云间月|lit=Glaze in the Box, Moon among the Clouds}} as "As man hides Li in a box, so nature hides Yue between the clouds," and explains that "Li" is a "precious ceramic ornament" and "Yue" refers to the moon.
** Deeper lore connects to the sword [[Lion's Roar]] {{Lang|zh=匣里龙吟|zh_tl=Dragon's Roar in the Box}}. Lion's Roar is inspired by a famous poem {{Lang|zh=古剑篇|zh_tl=Tale of the Ancient Sword}},<ref>Gushien [https://so.gushiwen.cn/shiwenv_30239239f544.aspx 古剑篇]</ref> which describes the casting of an ancient sword which "like a white lotus spit out from a glazed jade box, the golden ring on the hilt of the sword is dyed with the brilliance of the sun and the moon" {{Lang|zh=琉璃玉匣吐莲花，错镂金环映明月}}. This is the most likely in-game etymology of "Liyue."

===Cultural References===
* Liyue is inspired by China.
* Liyue Harbor is said to be an economical center, similar to many port cities in China.
*Morax, the founder of Liyue, quotes some proverbs from the ''{{w|Analects}}'' of Confucius in a (non-canon) official blog post.<ref>HoYoverse Chinese News: [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/13126 提瓦特美食札记 “展信佳。”&mdash;&mdash;钟离生日快乐]</ref>
*[[Divine Body from Guyun]] says a variety of different ideals were born and died during the [[Archon War]], where Liyue survived the war. It may be a reference to the {{w|Hundred Schools of Thought}} during the {{w|Warring States period}} of Ancient China, where the Confucian philosophy of "Liyue" (Rites and Music) survived the war in academia.
