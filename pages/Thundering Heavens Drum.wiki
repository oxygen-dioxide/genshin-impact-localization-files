|description    = This kind of war drum used to be a feature of every major mountain pass in [[Liyue]], where it served as an important piece of equipment for the [[Millelith]]. When enemy forces approached, the sentries would sound the war drum as a warning and the troops would assume battle formation. The thunderous sound of this drum would also be heard when troops departed on a campaign, booming out so loud that one imagines it echoed throughout the heaven. Today, however, the people of Liyue live in peacetime, and the Millelith's signal-transmission techniques and systems of issuing orders have moved on. As a result, war drums have disappeared from the military and taken on a new role as a symbol of good fortune in various festivals.
