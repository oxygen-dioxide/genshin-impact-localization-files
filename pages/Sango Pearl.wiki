{{Description|These pearls only grow alongside the coral of Watatsumi, and they will emit a cooling sensation in your palm as gentle as a moonbeam.<br />Some local stories say that if held by a person in whose veins runs the blood of Watatsumi, these pearls will become brighter still, for these pearls are the blood that [[Watatsumi Omikami]] shed for its people. Other legends say that the great Omikami used a pearl as bright as the moon to shine upon [[Enkanomiya]], leading the people who dwelt there up to the surface. As such, the Sango Pearls are akin to sacred relics to some.<br />The "pearls and waves" of the [[Sangonomiya Clan|Sangonomiya]] emblem are said to come from these very waves that embraced Watatsumi and the bright gem that gave it light.}}
