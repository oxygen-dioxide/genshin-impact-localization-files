|description    = A heavy dark bronze metal water kettle. Beneath its simple exterior is excellent performance brought about by excellent material and shape. Even if placed atop a charcoal fire for an entire week, this kettle will experience no serious warping, and will not pose any safety concerns. As such, café staff can just use this sort of kettle and never worry about heating water, which allows them to focus all their energies on improving the quality of their coffee.
