:'''[[Nahida]]:''' After meeting the Traveler, my dreams have gotten more lively. I dreamed of the [[Sabzeruz Festival]] today, so I think it's a great opportunity to celebrate it with everyone in the dream~
:'''Nahida:''' Let's walk around before going to the [[Grand Bazaar]] to see the performance.
:{{DIcon}} Go to Treasures Street
::'''Food Vendor:''' Thanks to Lesser Lord Kusanali, my restaurant's been doing great!
::'''Food Vendor:''' But I heard from traveling scholars that there are many delicious dishes outside of Sumeru.
::'''Food Vendor:''' I wonder if I can add them to my menu so that my customers can have something new for a change...
::'''Nahida:''' Cuisine from other nations? I happen to know a few nice recipes. Let me see, which one would suit your restaurant...
:;(Select one of [[Jade Parcels]], [[Mondstadt Hash Brown]], or [[Bird Egg Sushi]])<!--pretty sure the choice doesn't matter-->
::'''Nahida:''' This recipe looks great, I hope everyone likes it!
::'''Food Vendor:''' Thank you, Lesser Lord Kusanali!
::'''Food Vendor:''' I will devote myself to studying this recipe so that everyone in Sumeru City can taste the most authentic exotic cuisine!
::'''Nahida:''' Next, let's go to the outskirts of Sumeru City~
:;(Nahida walks to the outskirts of the city)
::'''[[Jahan]]:''' *sigh* Why the poor harvest?
::'''Jahan:''' I did everything by the book. What do I do now...
::'''Nahida:''' He looks troubled. Let me help him.

::'''Nahida:''' When growing such plants, you'll have to take note of the light conditions and water sources. Perhaps you can do it like this...
::'''Nahida:''' And it will grow well!
::'''Jahan:''' It's the Dendro Archon herself! Am I dreaming...
::'''Jahan:''' I'll cultivate them with the utmost care. I'm so grateful for your help!

:'''Nahida:''' Ah, the celebration at the Grand Bazaar should've reached its climax. I should go celebrate together with everyone.
;(Nahida walks to the Grand Bazaar)
:'''Nahida:''' I've been here several times by possessing other people's consciousness, but it's my first time celebrating with the crowd in a dream.
:'''???:''' It's Lesser Lord Kusanali! Come, everyone, over here!
:'''Nahida:''' Are you having fun? I've brought some Yalda Candies. Let's share~

;(Give candies to the vendor)
:'''Vendor:''' Thank you, Lesser Lord Kusanali! It's such a blessing to receive Yalda Candies from you.
