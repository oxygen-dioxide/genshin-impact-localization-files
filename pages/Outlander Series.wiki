The '''Outlander Series''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a 4-Star [[Weapon Series]] in Genshin Impact. They are weapons that were not crafted in Teyvat.

Currently, this series is exclusive to the PS4/PS5 platform. While PC/mobile users can obtain these weapons via cross save, the ability bonus will be rendered inactive while not on PlayStation Network.

There is no shared ability bonus among the weapons of this series, but they increase the attack of a specific character by 66.
