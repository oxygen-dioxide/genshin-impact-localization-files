'''Stanley''' is an [[NPCs|NPC]] known in [[Mondstadt]] for his adventures, especially his travels in the [[Mare Jivari]].

==Profile==
Stanley was a famous adventurer from [[Mondstadt]]. Several years before the game's start, he traversed the Mare Jivari with a greenhorn adventurer named [[Stanley|Hans Archibald]], but he sacrificed his life to save Hans. Out of guilt for letting Stanley die in a windless place, which Mondstadters believe would prevent one's soul from being carried to the afterlife, Hans Archibald took on the name and identity of his friend and started spreading stories of him to keep the memory of him alive. Eventually, when [[Venti]] learned of Stanley's plight, he revealed himself as [[Barbatos]] and used his powers to save the real Stanley's soul, allowing Hans to find closure.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land (Quest)}}</ref>

As a result of Hans' posturing, most people believe that Stanley survived but his unnamed friend did not. [[Zhiqiong]] cites Stanley's friend as an example of someone who is remembered by others because they attempted something great, even if they did not live through it; the Traveler does not inform her of the truth.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Valor's Afterglow (Quest)}}</ref>
