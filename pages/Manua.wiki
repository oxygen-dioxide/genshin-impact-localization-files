==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Manua:''' None of the plans today are too impractical.
:{{DIcon}} Greetings.
::'''Manua:''' Hello, hello. I am Manua, the assistant to our chief. Hopefully she hasn't caused you any trouble...
::'''Manua:''' Don't get me wrong, Amina is very reliable, and she's learned much in the ways of managing the tribe from her grandfather. I have only the fullest of faith in her potential.
::'''Manua:''' But she is still young, and children are bound to miss some details from time to time, so please bear with her.
:{{DIcon}} What plans do you speak of?
::'''Manua:''' Ah, it's Miss Amina's entertainment facilities renovation plan.
::'''Manua:''' Do you find it strange that the chief would bring her plans to me?
::'''Manua:''' Heh, it's because I'm her assistant.
::'''Manua:''' Amina is very bright and constantly comes up with innovative ideas, like building a water coaster or hosting a kayaking tournament.
::'''Manua:''' If you ask me, I think she just wants to ride in a water coaster herself, haha. But her ideas have all been very popular with tourists, so we should support her as best as we can.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Manua:''' See ya. I hope you'll have a good time at the tribe.
