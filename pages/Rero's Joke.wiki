;(Talk at first location)
:'''Rero:''' Ah, kind passers-by, please, please take pity on me...
:{{DIcon}} What's happening?
:{{DIcon}} Do you need help?
:'''Rero:''' Thank you, thank you for listening to these old bones pour out their woes... *sigh* Come here, come here, do let me say a little more...
:'''Rero:''' When I was but a newborn, the presiding priest accidentally knocked a lamp over, burning all the long hair on my aunt's head.
:{{DIcon}} Oh dear...
:'''Rero:''' Later, I contracted some strange illness, and from then on suffered from a chronic ungainliness. Still later on, I fell from my cradle, breaking six ribs...
:'''Rero:''' And when I grew a little older, my father hit me over the head with his shovel by mistake as he fought to save my cousin, who had almost choked to death on mushrooms...
:'''Rero:''' And then there was the time when my beloved finch was eaten by the Wen Kamuy our family kept, before that same Wen Kamuy was knocked off a cliff by a boar...
:'''Rero:''' After that, the girl I liked accidentally sacrificed the priest to the Great [[Thunderbird]], and she was exiled from the island...
:'''Rero:''' When I grew up, my grandma died from grief at my ugliness and gloominess, and my grandpa soon followed...
:'''Rero:''' Then after that...
:{{DIcon}} You could at least take comfort in your family, right?
:'''Rero:''' Ah, speaking of my family... When I came of age, our witch doctor told me that I wouldn't be able to have children, because I'd grown a... One moment, let me show you...
:{{DIcon}} Uh, I'll pass!
:{{DIcon}} Too much information, thank you!
:'''Rero:''' *sigh* Alright. But would you listen to just one last thing? If you don't mind, I'd like you to do just this last thing for me...
:{{DIcon}} Well, go ahead.
:{{DIcon}} As long as it's not some weird stuff again...
:'''Rero:''' Some time ago, I accidentally dropped my golden ring into my wife's grave as I was burying her...
:'''Rero:''' That is the last thing I have in my possession, but I dare not dig it out, for fear that her spirit might be angered...
:{{DIcon}} Uh, so this is a grave-robbing gig?
:'''Rero:''' Well, uh... I mean, you're an outsider... You do all sorts of strange things, don't you?
:'''Rero:''' Um. No, no, wait... I meant to say that an outsider like you would be able to avoid angering the local spirits, yes...
:'''Rero:''' Go to Chirai Shrine. Her grave should be right beside it...
;(Talk to Rero again)
:'''Rero:''' Go to Chirai Shrine. Her grave should be right beside it...

;(After defeating the [[Thunderhelm Lawachurl]])
:'''Rero:''' Ah-hahahahah! Ah my, ah me... I'm all out of breath...
:'''Rero:''' Ahaha... I'm tearing up over here! Ah, dear Chikapu, if only you were here to see this!
:{{DIcon}} I gotta admit, you're pissing me off.
:{{DIcon}} Care to share what this is all about?
:'''Rero:''' Hahaha... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please, don't be angry...
:'''Rero:''' I and my wife have always enjoyed playing pranks on others. We've never pulled the same trick twice, you know? And everyone enjoyed them, too!
:'''Rero:''' Later, she suffered from a serious illness and left this world early... She told me then that I had to play a trick on someone in front of her grave, or her spirit wouldn't be able to move on...
:'''Rero:''' So I did. It was Chikapu's wish. How did it go? Pretty good, huh?
:{{DIcon}} It was kinda lame.
:{{DIcon}} You nearly got us killed!
:{{DIcon}} I'm gonna have trouble trusting you from now on...
:'''Rero:''' Ah, come on! You outsiders are no fun!
:'''Rero:''' Well, I've still got a trusty water-spraying trick, if you'd like to see it... No? Aw, come on!
:'''Rero:''' Alright, alright, I'm leaving! See you!
