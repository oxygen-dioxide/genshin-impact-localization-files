:'''Qispi:''' One, two... Mmm, three...
:'''Qispi:''' Hmm, hmm... One, two...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon, sound the weirdo alarm!
:'''Qispi:''' Ah, if you ask me, the only weirdos round here are you outlanders... Ho... hoho... This sure isn't the type of place you'd expect to see outlanders...
:'''Paimon:''' Is this some kind of... forbidden place? Or sacred place?
:'''Qispi:''' Nope, just some place I discovered, completely by chance... a place of buried treasure. Mmm, well come on then you two, huddle up. Can you hear it? This very special rock before you... this is... the "Treasure Stone"...
:'''Qispi:''' The low humming noise it makes rises and falls, almost like... the sound of breathing.
:{{DIcon}} "Hard" life being a rock, huh?
::'''Paimon:''' It's only breathing... What's so hard about that?
:{{DIcon}} I'm good at breathing too.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, what's so amazing about being able to breathe... Wait, why are we even talking about this?
:'''Paimon:''' A rock... can breathe?
:'''Qispi:''' Yes, and not only that... If you press your ear against it, you can hear a beat too... even the sound of rock grinding against rock beneath its coarse surface...
:'''Qispi:''' Hehe.. Hoho... Such wonderful sounds.
:'''Qispi:''' And, and... If you feed it small rocks, it'll give you even better, shinier rocks in return...
:'''Qispi:''' Aaaah, simply incredible, is it not? Look at these gemstones... look! One, two...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's what you were doing when we came over just now, counting gems...
:'''Qispi:''' Yes, and I can tell that after gobbling up all these rocks, the Treasure Stone has become even stronger, even more powerful than before...
:'''Qispi:''' This must be... a miracle! Ah, my Treasure Stone... my precious...
:{{DIcon}} That sounds... rather suspicious.
:{{DIcon}} For real? Why does it sound like some kind of scam...
:'''Qispi:''' Heh, hehe... I never expected outsiders like you to believe me. Nobody would believe it... before they'd tried it themselves.
:'''Qispi:''' I myself discovered it by pure chance after placing some ore that I'd collected on the Treasure Stone's edge...
:'''Qispi:''' Speaking of which... Why don't you give it a try? Seeing is believing, after all!
:'''Qispi:''' It just so happens that it's already eaten all the rocks around here though. I need to find it some new ones... but I can't go looking myself...
:'''Paimon:''' Umm... Why not?
:'''Qispi:''' Well of course, someone has to stay here and look after the Treasure Stone, don't they? C&mdash;Can you imagine what would happen if it went into hiding underground while I was away... What would I do then!?
:'''Qispi:''' I've stood guard here for such a long time now... all the rocks I had on me, I've already fed them to the Stone...
:'''Qispi:''' G&mdash;Go, find me some new ones, and I'll prove it. I'll f&mdash;feed them to it before your very eyes!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, sounds like a classic con-artist's pitch...
:'''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Wanna give it a try?
:{{DIcon}} Well, if they're just rocks...
:'''Qispi:''' Hehe, then it's a deal! You go pick some rocks, give them to me, and I'll feed them to the Treasure Stone... and I guarantee you it'll make some even better ones...
;(Offer {{Item|Iron Chunk|x=5}} or {{Item|White Iron Chunk|x=5}})
:'''Qispi:''' Mmm... I'll feed these to the Treasure Stone once things have quieted down...
:'''Qispi:''' Just give it some time, hehe, and it'll produce some even better rocks... Hehe... One, two...
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to ''Qispi'' again)
:'''Qispi:''' Mmm... Patience, patience is the key. When things have quietened down, I'll feed these to the Treasure Stone... Hehe, thanks for bringing these rocks...
:'''Qispi:''' C'mon Treasure Stone, time to make some even better rocks, hehe... One, two...

;(Talk to ''Qispi'' after waiting for next server reset)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, something actually did grow out of it...
:'''Paimon:''' All hail the Treasure St... Wait a sec, you didn't just place those on top, did you?
:'''Qispi:''' ...Heh, hehe, do I look like I would do something so foolish?
:'''Qispi:''' Thanks to those rocks you brought, the Treasure Stone is even more energetic than it was before. Oh, can't you hear it...?
:'''Qispi:''' That sound, pulsing as the magma that flows beneath the earth, is just like... Ah, like a heartbeat...
:'''Qispi:''' I knew it... I knew I just had to find some other rocks to feed it...
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh... Paimon's not hearing anything...
:'''Paimon:''' Can you hear it, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Just sounds like any old rock to me...
::'''Paimon:''' Right...
:{{DIcon}} Can't you hear it, hear how it screeches? "Whooooooaaaa"!
::'''Paimon:''' No way! You're just trying to scare Paimon again!
:'''Qispi:''' Hehe, outlanders... Or perhaps I should say, distinguished guests from afar...
:'''Qispi:''' If you are able, please find me some more rocks... better, more beautiful ones... The power of the Treasure Stone will not disappoint you...
:'''Qispi:''' I can feel it in my bones... I can tell that this will be good for it...
:'''Paimon:''' Why does it feel like we're falling deeper and deeper into a trap...
:'''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} If it means we'll be able to get our hands on some better rocks...
:'''Paimon:''' It's definitely worth a try...
:'''Qispi:''' Hehe, great! So this time, you'll pick some even better rocks than before, and you'll give them straight to me... And with even better rocks to feed upon, the Treasure Stone will surely become more powerful than ever...
;(Offer {{Item|Crystal Chunk|x=3}}, {{Item|Amethyst Lump|x=3}}, or {{Item|Condessence Crystal|x=3}})
:'''Qispi:''' Mmm... I'll feed the rocks you brought to the Treasure Stone once things have quieted down... Haha, and what marvelous rocks these are...
:'''Qispi:''' Just give it some time, hehe, and it'll produce some even better rocks... Hehe... One, two...

;(Talk to ''Qispi'' after waiting for next server reset)
:'''Paimon:''' Would you look at that, it's done it again, and they're even better than before... Still feels pretty magical, despite the fact that we've seen it twice now...
:'''Qispi:''' Heh, hehe, wary outlanders...
:'''Qispi:''' Now that you have seen it for yourselves, you can no longer deny the greatness of the Treasure Stone.
:'''Qispi:''' Aaah, and thanks to the rocks you have brought, the Treasure Stone's power has grown even stronger...
:'''Qispi:''' Who knows how powerful it might become...
:'''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, even Paimon's starting to feel curious...
:'''Paimon:''' All you have to do is feed it rocks and it creates even better ones for you... But how does that even work? Why don't we crack it open and take a look inside?
:'''Qispi:''' H&mdash;How could you even suggest such a thing? No, I shall not allow it!
:'''Qispi:''' If you're seriously planning on cracking it open... You'll have to step over my cold, dead body first...
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, that was just a throwaway comment...
:'''Qispi:''' Hmph, well considering that you brought it all those rocks before, I'll let your impudence slide... But just this once...
:'''Paimon:''' O&mdash;Okay...
:'''Qispi:''' I can feel it, hehe! If I can just feed the Treasure Stone some even higher quality rocks, I'm certain it'll produce something incredible...
:'''Qispi:''' Traveler from afar, a foreign merchant once told me of a special type of stone from the desert that holds extraordinary power in store...
:'''Qispi:''' Its name... Yes, its name is Trishiraite. If you could but bring me it so I could feed it to the Treasure Stone...
:'''Qispi:''' I'm certain, beyond a doubt...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... What do you think, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Let's give it a try!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's feeling pretty curious to see what will happen too, that's for sure...
:'''Qispi:''' If you really can get your hands on Trishiraite... A single chunk should suffice...
;(Offer {{Item|Trishiraite|x=1}})
:'''Qispi:''' Haha... So this is Trishiraite, a stone that does not grow within the borders of Natlan. When the Treasure Stone consumes it, it will surely be able to... absorb its power.
:'''Qispi:''' Ah, how I long to know, how I yearn to know, my Treasure Stone...

:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, the Treasure Stone's gone. All that's left is an Avatar of Lava...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, and that weird tribesperson's nowhere to be seen either. You don't think the Avatar of Lava...
