|text      = I know I shouldn't be sighing on a day like this, but this assignment... it's just so, so hard. No matter how much effort I put in, I can't seem to make any progress. If this keeps up, will I eventually have to drop out and go home...? No, no way. I can't let my parents or my mentor down.

Dear Mighty [[Lesser Lord Kusanali|God of Wisdom]], please, I beg you, let my brain start working properly... Why is everything so blurry... I can't... do this... anymore...

Ah, she's finally asleep. Honestly, after staying awake for days on end, it's no wonder she passed out...

Don't worry, she'll be fine. In fact, her prep work is already more than thorough. I think I'll just organize the key materials for her and place them on top of her paper.

If you have some time, could you please come over and keep her company? Maybe chat with her when she wakes up, or take her for a walk &mdash; anything to ease her mind for a bit, really... Thank you.
