==Description==
"Hear my last words, O [[Menilek|hero bearing the name 'Transcendence']]"<br>
"[[Xiuhcoatl|The calamity that flows within its veins]] is more ancient still than your very name"<br>
"If you yet pity mortals like your ancestors once did"<br>
"Then sever its neck and grant it the joy of freedom"

Though the stooping old sage made known this oracle to him, the hero who had suffered so much turned a deaf ear to it.<br>
Perhaps he had endured too many partings up till then, but he simply bent down, holding the dying [[Saurian]] whelp in his embrace.<br>
He touched the young Saurian's bloodstained feathers with precious elixir, utterly ignoring the sigh that marked the sage's departure.

"Whether tyrant or rampaging dragon, whether curse or fate"<br>
"The descendants of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] bow to nothing, and to no one"<br>
"If this laughable curse is a chain he was born with"<br>
"Then let me break it, just as our glorious ancestors did"

And so, the warrior named Menilek and his loyal companion [[Holawaqa Ngoubou|Ngoubou]] embarked on a pilgrimage,<br>
And many a song and scroll passed down to this day in the Flower-Feather Clan tell of those magnificent adventures undertaken by this human and Saurian:<br>
They tell of how the hero tore the mountains apart with thunderous bowstrings, of how the whelp used cunning to pierce the wicked python's throat,<br>
How they together fought a huge monster for forty days, and how they finally vanquished it using a single fish — a pike, to be precise...<br>
The stories even tell of how Menilek contended against [[Tenoch]], who had not yet been exiled from his tribe, beneath the rocks burned by countless leaping flames,<br>
And how Menilek came to admire the mighty warrior's heroism and bravery, later standing by his side many years later as they faced the [[Cataclysm|tide of darkness]]...<br>
Such are the legends now known by all who dwell on the [[Natlan|scorching plains]], whose strains and stanzas have been sung by countless poets for five hundred years.

It is often said that all unions must lead to fated partings,<br>
But even so, some hold onto that which people call "hope,"<br>
Believing that new flowers will bloom, even on fields barren and burning.<br>
Yet, just as power uncontainable is the root of many a tragedy,<br>
So too is well-intentioned hope the mold in which many worldly miseries are cast.<br>
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, he always comforted himself,<br>
Until all hope turned into betrayal, and until tomorrow would never come again.

"Ngoubou, my loyal companion, please rest here for a while"<br>
"I'll be back as soon as I finish, so get a good night's rest"<br>
"Once the dark tide has subsided, I will hurry back to your side and wake you"<br>
"And once spring returns to the earth, I shall go with you to see the new flowers blooming on the high cliffs"
