{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yiqing:''' Guess I'll have to try a new prescription...
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Yiqing:''' I'm the physician in this area. Come find me anytime if you're feeling unwell.
::'''Yiqing:''' You're young and full of fire, and ironically, that makes you more susceptible to illnesses in these mountains.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Heatiness?
:::'''Yiqing:''' Heatiness is the root of all evil inside the body, and young people are especially prone to it, for their bodies are easily excited.
:::'''Yiqing:''' I have a few herbs to help quench the flames and vent the heat. Most effective when taken with herbal tea. Please help yourselves.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Qingxin|20|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} Why are you trying new prescriptions?
::'''Yiqing:''' There are no panaceas, so a good physician must find the right medicine to treat each patient's symptoms.
::'''Yiqing:''' If the illness is complex, then we'll have to dig deep to find the ultimate prescription.
::'''Yiqing:''' Well, all that assumes the physician has seen enough to be familiar with lots of different medicines, of course...
::'''Yiqing:''' To master the effects of different prescriptions, I have to keep trying and learn from my mistakes.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yiqing:''' Work out regularly, and keep a balanced diet.
