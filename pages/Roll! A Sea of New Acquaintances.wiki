{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's about time for us to head off to Liyue. We've got a Card Snatcher to catch!

;(Cross the bridge from the Liyue Harbor entrance)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Liyue Harbor is still bustling as always.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' "Where merchants flock and all ships dock"... Now I understand what that saying was trying to describe. Still, nothing beats seeing it with your own eyes!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 baiwen 01.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Welcome to Liyue Harbor. I hope you had a smooth journey? Lady Ningguang instructed me to wait for you here.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Oh, it's Ningguang's secretary! Bai... uh, which Bai is it again?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 baiwen 02.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' It's Baiwen. I assist Lady Ningguang with collecting and organizing intelligence.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right, Baiwen! Paimon remembers now. The other two are [[Baishi]] and [[Baixiao]].
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Lady Ningguang? You mean Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, that's her. But why does Ningguang want to see us? Wait, and how did she even know that we'd be arriving in Liyue Harbor today!?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 baiwen 03.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Lady Ningguang likes to stay informed. Nothing slips through her intelligence network.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 baiwen 04.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' She wishes to invite our visitor from Fontaine, Mademoiselle Charlotte, to join her at Yujing Terrace to discuss cooperation.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hmm? What would she want with me? This is the first time I've ever been to Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 baiwen 05.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Lady Ningguang has known of you for quite some time: a talented and capable journalist with The Steambird who writes insightful, engaging, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; factual prose. She rather admires your work.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 baiwen 06.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' She also understands that in revealing the truth through your exclusive news, you have offended some interested parties that have been pulling strings behind the scenes &mdash; and that is why you have been sent on an international reporting trip to cover the Genius Invokation TCG events.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, what? That's terrible... Poor Charlotte.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' No, no, it's just part of the job. I'm already used to it.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But I'm surprised to learn that Lady Ningguang knows so much about my situation. Does she know my boss or something?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon wouldn't be surprised. She seems to know everyone and everything.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 baiwen 07.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Lady Ningguang also welcomes the two of you to join, if you're interested.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh? You didn't tell me you were best buddies with Lady Ningguang...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon wouldn't go THAT far... We've just been invited to the Jade Chamber as honored guests a couple of times, y'know...
:{{DIcon}} Enough with the humble-bragging, Paimon...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, but anyway... if Ningguang wants to discuss work stuff with Charlotte, it's probably gonna be best if we stay out of the way, right?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe we can go ask around about the Card Snatcher while you have your meeting with Ningguang.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, are you sure?
:{{DIcon}} Absolutely. No trouble at all.
:{{DIcon}} While we're at it, we can check out our old haunts.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Alright, thanks! Then I'll leave you to it. Let's catch up and swap notes later? I'm actually pretty excited to meet Lady Ningguang, so I don't want to keep her waiting...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 baiwen 08.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Very well. Please, Mademoiselle Charlotte, follow me.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' See you two later.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like Charlotte's a top-notch journalist, huh. Paimon's not sure what that "exclusive" news is all about... but it definitely sounds like a big deal.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And if she manages to write up an article about this Card Snatcher case, we'll be featured in her exclusive news, too!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, it feels like we're about to become famous!
:{{DIcon}} ...We're already famous.
:{{DIcon}} Let's just focus on the task at hand.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, you're right. Okay, why don't we start asking around at the docks? There's always a lot of people coming and going &mdash; maybe someone's seen people trading cards there.
----
;(Talk to Guanhai)<!-- talking again gives the same dialogue -->
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi there! We'd like to ask you about something.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 guanhai 01.ogg}} '''Guanhai:''' Hmm? Oh, sure, ask away. The ship's already set sail anyway, so I've got all the time in the world...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you seen anyone around here recently collecting card backs? You know, for that really popular game, Genius Invokation TCG?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 guanhai 02.ogg}} '''Guanhai:''' Collecting card backs? Hmm... I've definitely seen people around here playing the game, but... I'm usually preoccupied with thinking about the sea, I've never paid too much attention to it...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...It's fine, we'll ask someone else.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 guanhai 03.ogg}} '''Guanhai:''' Ugh... I really can't afford to wake up late next time...

;(Talk to Uncle Sun)<!-- talking again gives the same dialogue -->
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there. Got a question for ya.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 unclesun 01.ogg}} '''Uncle Sun:''' Ah hello, ask away! If it's fish you want, I've got all the answers!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, actually it's not about fish. We were just wondering, since you're here all day running your stall, have you seen anyone collecting card backs for Genius Invokation TCG?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 unclesun 02.ogg}} '''Uncle Sun:''' Genius Invokation TCG? Hmm, 'fraid I don't know anything 'bout that. People come here for Black-Back Bass, but not card backs.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Sorry to bother you, then. We'll try our luck somewhere else.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 unclesun 03.ogg}} '''Uncle Sun:''' Don't you wanna buy some fish to take with you? All my fish are "super fresh," you know.

;(Talk to Yong'an)<!-- talking again gives the same dialogue -->
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi there, can we ask you a question?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 yongan 01.ogg}} '''Yong'an:''' Sure, go ahead. I'll a&mdash;a&mdash;ATCHOO! Answer as best I can.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you noticed anyone here collecting card backs for Genius Invokation TCG recently?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 yongan 02.ogg}} '''Yong'an:''' Card backs? ATCHOO! No, I'm afraid not.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 yongan 03.ogg}} '''Yong'an:''' Sorry, just before, a... ATCHOO! A girl in Inazuman attire walked by and I've... ATCHOO! Been sneezing non-stop since.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, take care of yourself, and get well soon... We'll keep asking around.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 3 yongan 04.ogg}} '''Yong'an:''' I'll be alright. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never... ATCHOO! ...Prevail.

;(After talking to all three NPCs)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, this got off to a slow start. Let's try somewhere else.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hey, you two. Looking for someone?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon knows that voice... it's Kazuha!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Nice to see you again, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} It's been too long.
:{{DIcon}} How've you been?
::{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 03b 1.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Very well, thank you. Even better now that you're here.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Captain Beidou needed to return to Liyue to take care of some business, so I've been taking the chance to get to walk around town. It's a nice surprise to run into you two here.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Looks like you have questions. May I be of any help?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, long story short...
:{{Black Screen|Paimon tells Kazuha all that's happened recently...}}
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I see... Well, the harbor breeze is as peaceful and pleasant and as ever. I don't believe that the Card Snatcher you're looking for has been through here.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, okay...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I'm not sure if that's good news or bad in your eyes. Oh, by the way, it seems there's a competition being held nearby. I stopped to have a look. This "Genius Invokation TCG"... It seems to be immensely popular at the moment.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Have you never played it before, Kazuha?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' No, I haven't. I have quietly observed from the side.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 09.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The Captain brought a small box aboard recently that contained a variety of beautifully illustrated cards. She enjoys playing with the crew, while enjoying a few drinks... a few too many, perhaps.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's called a [[Casket of Tomes]]. It's what you use to carry your cards in, and it helps you find players nearby, too!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You should give it a try, Kazuha! The rules are pretty easy to pick up, and then you'll have a fun game to play with your friends.
:{{DIcon}} This is the perfect chance to learn.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 10.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hmm, forging friendship through card-based combat does sound quite delightful. Alright then, show me the ropes, if you please.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 08a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can teach you! Paimon's watched {{Traveler}} play a ton of times, so even Paimon's a master invokator now!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After we teach you the rules, we'll also have to get you a Casket of Tomes.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 11.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' But what about this Card Snatcher you're looking for? Is not dealing with that more urgent at present?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good point... Hehe, Paimon got so caught up chatting with our old friend that she nearly forgot about our promise to our new friend.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Now, where should we go next...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Hey, look over there.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Isn't that the Inazuman courier who Diona was chatting with back in Mondstadt? What's she doing here?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 12.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Ah, I just noticed the logo at her waist. Isn't that [[Komaniya Express]]?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Do you know that company, Kazuha?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 kazuha 13.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, I've heard of it. They provide delivery services in Inazuma.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Looks like she's having some trouble. Why don't we go and introduce ourselves?

;(Approach Kirara)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kirara 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hmm, which way is it from here...?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there! You look lost, need any help?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kirara 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Meow! You frightened the life out of me... Huh? Oh, I recognize you... Weren't you at The Cat's Tail in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! Paimon's name is Paimon, and these two are {{Traveler}} and Kaedehara Kazuha. It's a strange coincidence running into you again!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hello, hello... My name's Kirara. I'm a courier for Inazuma's Komaniya Express.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I know Komaniya Express is widely praised for its punctual and safe delivery services. But I wasn't aware that the company had started operating internationally.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Wow, it's rare to meet a fellow Inazuman abroad!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Our company just recently began expanding its services overseas... which is great for me, because now I basically get paid to travel all around the world! Only downside is, I sometimes get a bit lost when it's my first time in a new city...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Sometimes when I'm running late, I even have to change back into my original form and climb over walls to make sure the parcel's on time.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Uh... Do you happen to know the way to the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? I feel like I've been going in circles all day.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we know the place. We'll show you the way.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 5 kirara 08.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You will? Oh, thank you so much!
----
;(Approach Wangsheng Funeral Parlor)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' "Down on the ground the dice spin around, while high in the sky the sun shines bright"... Hmm, that last line could use some work...
:{{Introductory Note|Hu Tao}}
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Here we are! This is it.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, why it's {{Traveler}} and Paimon! What brings you here?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' And I see you've brought some... friends? Clients? Business partners? New associates?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahem... Maybe leave the introductions to Paimon. This is Kaedehara Kazuha, and this is Kirara.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hello, it's an honor to meet you.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Greetings, old friends and new. So, what brings you all to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor this fine day?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Wait! Don't tell me &mdash; is it our latest promotion? I'm touched that you journeyed all this way...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no, we were just giving Kirara directions.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hello, Ma'am. Are you Director Hu Tao of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? I'm your Komaniya Express courier, and we have a delivery for you &mdash; I just need to ask you for a signature.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Let me see... Ah yes, I've been expecting this.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Delivery services these days make everything so much easier... I used to have to send my consultant running to and fro for this kind of thing.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Say, Kirara, how flexible is your company in terms of delivering different types of goods? How about a living person? And what about someone who's more in-between alive and dead?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh!? Uh...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Her tails are standing up on end...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Guess that's a no... Well, maybe we can talk about potentially expanding your company's services sometime.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' C&mdash;Could I trouble you to take a moment and leave a five-star review?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 10.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Five stars? That's an odd number... Let's make it an even six! No, much too low &mdash; service this good deserves at least eight! In fact, nine: one extra for going the extra mile!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Oh, five stars will be plenty, really... But your enthusiasm means a lot!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Alright, I should be on my way now. Thanks again for the directions.
:{{DIcon}} You're welcome.
::{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Don't mention it.
:{{DIcon}} Do you handle all of the deliveries?
::{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kirara 06b 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' No... Not necessarily. Business has been picking up lately, so the company has hired lots of new staff. But I handle all the international deliveries, because I'm the quickest &mdash; I am a youkai, after all.
::{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So chances are that we'll see you on the road again soon.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Cool! Well, I look forward to seeing you all again soon. Although... hopefully next time it won't be because I'm lost...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I heard you reciting a poem just now, Director Hu. May I ask from where you drew your inspiration?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 11.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh? Do you share a liking for poetry as well?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Once in a while, I throw words at each other and see what sticks.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 12.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Aiya, there's no need for self-deprecation. I've seen people from all walks of life, and I can tell just from the way your sleeves flutter in the wind that you're a man of culture.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 13.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Anyway &mdash; I'm preparing for the tournament final that will be held shortly. Anyone feeling poetic? I need ideas.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tournament final? You mean the Genius Invokation TCG tournament?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 14.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Yeah, that's the one!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 15.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' My next opponent is no small fry. Most of the time he's so unassuming, you couldn't pick him out of a crowd. But during this tournament, it's like he sprang up outta the ground like a Whopperflower and took the competition completely by surprise.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 16.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' So I have a strong feeling that this will be a tough battle to win.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then shouldn't you be focusing on your strategy? How is writing poetry gonna help...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 17.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Because skill doesn't thrill unless you've also got style!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 18.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Lemme give you an example you'd be more familiar with... To make a great dish, it takes not just flavor, but presentation too. Ever heard the saying, "It takes two flints to light a fire"? Same principle applies when you're trying to make an impression.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that sounds like it makes sense... Or does it? Paimon can never tell with Hu Tao...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hmm... In duels to the death, some samurai pay each other respects before the fight. Often, the two opponents find they have much in common.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 19.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' See, new guy gets it! What did I say &mdash; a man of culture!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' You flatter me, Director Hu. In my humble opinion, you could try incorporating your competitive aspirations into your lines. Or perhaps some words to intimidate your opponent.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 20.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, we have an expert among us! Hey, why don't you play a match with me? It'll help me warm up, and maybe find some creative inspiration.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' As much as I'd like to oblige, I'm afraid that I haven't played before. I don't even have my own deck.
:{{DIcon}} You can use my deck.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Perfect! Paimon really wants to watch you play. How about Paimon gives Kazuha a crash course right now?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Since everyone is so willing to offer their help, how can I refuse?
:{{Black Screen|Paimon explains the rules of Genius Invokation TCG to Kazuha...}}
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So there you have it, those are the rules! Paimon also included a few little tips and tricks she's picked up from watching {{Traveler}} play. Well? Think you can handle it from here, Kazuha?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I think I've got it. Thank you, Paimon Sensei.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' S&mdash;Sensei? Hehe, wow...! Paimon's never been called that before!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 21.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Well, Kazuha? Ready to go one-on-one against Liyue's most notorious backstreet poet?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 09.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, thank you for the opportunity, Director Hu.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 22.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Any last words before the duel begins?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 10.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Umm... one moment... Okay, I think I've got something.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... that was fast.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 23.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Alright! Say your piece, challenger!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, things are really heating up!
:{{DIcon}} Shh!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 11.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 12.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' "Minds like sharp blades clash, friendship forged through cards and dice, autumn leaves burn bright." I, Kaedehara Kazuha humbly accept this duel.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 24.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hehe... "The birds are chirping, the weather's so nice, watch me roll six Pyro dice!" Director Hu of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is ready for battle!
:{{DIcon}} Bit of a jarring change of genre there...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 25.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' My turn! Chi~!
:{{Black Screen|Hu Tao and Kazuha play a thrilling match of Genius Invokation TCG...}}
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 13.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Ah, I am defeated. It's no wonder that Director Hu has earned a spot in the tournament finals.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Talk about an exciting match, though!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 26.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Good thing I was able to "[[Send Off]]" of all those Summons of yours.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 27.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I have to say, it's hard to believe that this was your first time playing!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 14.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I owe it all to Paimon Sensei's teaching.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You really mean that? Yay, hehe!
:{{DIcon}} I agree. Paimon Sensei is the best teacher.
::{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 18a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww shucks, now Paimon's embarrassed, hehe...
:{{DIcon}} Look, Paimon Sensei's ego is so inflated, she's floating.
::{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 18b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Paimon's always been able to float in the air!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Kazuha, did you enjoy Genius Invokation TCG?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 15.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes indeed, there is a good variety of card abilities, and the tempo of the match can swing in an instant. I understand now why it's become so popular all across Teyvat.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh, seems the world's gained yet another TCG player.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Keqing! When did you get here?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Shortly after these two had begun their match. Everyone seemed so focused on the game that I didn't want to interrupt.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' You must be Kaedehara Kazuha? Your reputation precedes you. It's an honor to finally meet you.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 16.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Please, the honor is all mine. I have heard great things about the esteemed Yuheng from Captain Beidou.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Just call me Keqing. You played very well indeed, considering it was your first time. I'm impressed.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If we ever have the opportunity, I too would like to play a match with you.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Kazuha's already lined up his next opponent!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Why so surprised? Practically everyone at Yujing Terrace is playing Genius Invokation TCG these days. I also play from time to time, when time permits.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 17.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It would be my pleasure to join you for a match. However, I can't borrow {{Traveler}}'s deck forever. Our match might have to wait until after I manage to obtain my own Casket of Tomes.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh, that shouldn't be a problem. When we get back to the tournament venue, I'll ask a member of the Genius Invokation TCG Society to provide one for you.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' And please don't think about returning the favor &mdash; I assure you, it's no inconvenience. Besides, a friend of {{Traveler}} is a friend of us all.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Keqing.
:{{DIcon}} And so begins Kazuha's TCG journey.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 18.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I am grateful for your kindness, Keqing.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Pleasure. Also, Hu Tao, the final is about to start. I just came to make sure you're aware.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 28.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Don't worry, it might look like my mind's on other things, but I'm still listening!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 29.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Thorough preparation is the key to victory, after all!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Will you all be coming with us to the venue?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, there's something we wanted to discuss first...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, right! Back to the task at hand...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're investigating a Card Snatcher. Have any of you seen someone going around collecting Genius Invokation card backs recently?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 30.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Card backs? You mean like the kind with a treasure chest design on it?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, exactly! That's the one!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 31.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Funny, the word "snatcher" didn't come to mind when I saw him... He struck me as more of a... potential client.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 32.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I saw him playing a match against Chongyun this morning. He said that whoever lost would have to hand over their card back. It was close, but he managed to beat Chongyun in the end. After the match, he wiped the sweat from his forehead, took the card back from Chongyun, and left.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like we need to go talk to Chongyun, then.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 33.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' In that case, try Wuwang Hill. I think that's where he should be.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If I may ask, what else has this alleged "Card Snatcher" suspected of doing?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm... We don't know too much about him, apart from his obsession with Card Backs. But apparently, he's stolen other players' cards before!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I see. I'll inform the Millelith to be on the lookout for this individual, but while he's still at large, make sure you stay safe.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 kazuha 19.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I think I'll go with {{Traveler}} to Wuwang Hill.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Alright. See you later.
:{{DIcon}} Good luck in the final, Director.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 hutao 34.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' With so many people rooting for me, I'm sure the match will be over before I can say "hyu!"
:{{A|vo dpeq002 6 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's go find Chongyun.
----
;(Approach Chongyun and Little Fang at Wuwang Hill)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 littlefang 01.ogg}} '''Little Fang:''' *sobbing*...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hey, don't panic! I'm sure we'll find her.
:{{Introductory Note|Chongyun}}
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chongyun! We found you!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Paimon? {{Traveler}}? And...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hello, I am Kaedehara Kazuha.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hi, I'm Chongyun, an exorcist from Liyue. Long story short, this boy lost his friend while they were playing Hide-and-Seek.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 littlefang 02.ogg}} '''Little Fang:''' *sobbing* ...I told Little Yu not to hide anywhere too far away... But I've looked everywhere, and I still can't find her.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, it can be dangerous to get lost out here in the wilderness! We'll help look for her, too. Did you see which direction she went?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 littlefang 03.ogg}} '''Little Fang:''' Yeah... I kinda peeked a little bit when I was counting, she went that way...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, then let's start looking in that direction.

;(Investigate the first marker)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Little Yu? Little Yuuu, where are you...?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 8 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hmm, a snapped branch and some trampled grass... It looks like the girl was hiding here.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess that means we're on the right track. Let's keep going.

;(Approach the second marker)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not the Treasure Hoarders again! Ugh, let's hope Little Yu didn't run into them!

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously, why are we always running into these guys?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hey everyone, have a look at this.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are those Genius Invokation cards?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 littlefang 01.ogg}} '''Little Fang:''' Oh! I know that one, it belongs to Little Yu!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 littlefang 02.ogg}} '''Little Fang:''' Her dad gave her a deck, and it's her favorite thing. She takes it with her everywhere.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Little Yu was definitely here... But there's a fork in the road up ahead. Which way should we go?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hmm, wait a moment... Did Little Yu's father also give her a small box to store the cards?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 littlefang 03.ogg}} '''Little Fang:''' Yeah, a Casket of Tomes. I have one, too.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Oh! Of course! Why didn't I think of that?
:{{DIcon}} Right, it can locate nearby players!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes. As long as she still has the box with her, we should be able to determine her location.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quick, get our Casket of Tomes out!
:[[File:Roll! A Sea of New Acquaintances Casket of Tomes.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo dpeq002 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see... there's Chongyun and Little Fang... Aha! There's another player over there, that must be Little Yu!

;(Talk to Little Yu)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 littlefang 01.ogg}} '''Little Fang:''' Little Yu!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 littleyu 01.ogg}} '''Little Yu:''' Little Fang? *sob* I'm sorry, I shouldn't have gone so far away...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 littleyu 02.ogg}} '''Little Yu:''' I was trying to find a hiding place, but then I saw a bunch of really angry-looking guys and I got scared... So I ran and ran till I ended up here. *sob*
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Don't worry, we've already taken care of the bad guys.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But Wuwang Hill is full of yin energy. You shouldn't be playing in a place like this, understand?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 littlefang 02a.ogg}} '''Little Fang:''' Yes Sir, we won't do it again. Thanks, everyone.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 littleyu 03a.ogg}} '''Little Yu:''' Thank you for rescuing me...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Of course. Now, don't go running off. Hang tight for a moment, and I'll walk you both home.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... Paimon's glad she was okay.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Me too. Good on Kazuha for coming up with the Casket of Tomes idea.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, how did the rest of us not think of that? Guess we use it so often when we're playing cards that it didn't occur to us to use it for anything else.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a nifty little gadget. The Sumeru scholars who invented it must be super brainy...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, by the way Chongyun, we wanted to ask you about something...
:{{Black Screen|Paimon describes the Card Snatcher situation to Chongyun...}}
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Ugh, I knew there was something fishy about his obsession with card backs! I can't believe it... I let a thief slip right through my fingers! Whew, deep breaths... stay calm...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It's not your fault. You didn't know what his intentions were.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' If I'd been in your shoes, and he invited me to a duel on the same terms, I doubt I'd have sensed anything untoward either.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly. He's crafty. If you're not paying attention, he'll just steal the card he wants, and if that doesn't work, he'll come up with some other way to get his hands on it.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Did he happen to say anything after he got the card back?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Not a lot. He seemed to be in a hurry &mdash; he just packed up his things and then left for the docks. Hmm... but I did hear him grumbling about how far away Inazuma is, and how he wasn't looking forward to the boat journey.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This guy sure talks to himself a lot...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, it sounds like a pretty solid lead, so Paimon thinks we should follow it. But first, we should stop by the venue.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Then I guess I'll take Little Fang and Little Yu home now. Though I'd really rather help track down that thief...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, leave the Card Snatcher to us.
::{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 08a 1.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Sure. I'm counting on you.
:{{DIcon}} You okay? Try not to let it get to you.
::{{A|vo dpeq002 10 chongyun 08b 1.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yeah, you're right... When I get back, I should probably meditate for a while to calm myself down. Thanks for your concern.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, is it just Paimon, or did things suddenly get gloomier here after Chongyun left? Come on, let's get outta here.
----
;(Approach the venue)
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' What an incredible match. Truly mesmerizing to watch two players compete at such a high level.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? We missed the final again? Ugh, Paimon was hoping we'd at least get to catch a glimpse of the final round.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ah, you're back. Did you find Chongyun? Everything go smoothly?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There were a few hiccups along the way, but in the end, it all turned out fine! So, Hu Tao, did you win your match?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Of course! It didn't go quite as "hyu" as I'd expected, but all in all, it was still a good old "wham, bam, I'd like to thank my fam."
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' My opponent was no pushover. We both took out a couple of each other's character cards before it came down to the decisive round.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I closed my eyes, held my breath, and clenched the dice tightly in my hand as I prayed for the blessings of all my supporters in the audience &mdash; both visible and invisible! Wink wink!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Can you guess what happened next?
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Channeling all my skill and style, with a flick of the wrist I released the dice from my hands, and shouted my battle cry at the top of my lungs!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Watch me roll six Pyro dice!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' And lo and behold, when the dice came to rest, I counted precisely six of the Pyro persuasion! It was all over before I could say, "Pyre, pyre, pants on fire!"
:{{DIcon}} Amazing.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, sounds like your poem worked like a charm!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Director Hu's play style is rapid but graceful, like a lone butterfly navigating the depths of a forest. With a little luck beneath her wings, she soared above the competition.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Luck... is a key ingredient in every success. Wouldn't you agree, {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it's Ningguang and Charlotte! Finished with your business meeting?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Yep! I have to say, the Tianquan has a very incisive mind. She's extremely insightful. I gotta admit, I'm kinda envious of Baiwen now.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh wow, you must be Kaedehara Kazuha.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It's a pleasure to meet you, Charlotte.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' First {{Traveler}}, now Kazuha... Feels like I've been inducted into the Teyvat heroes club! I remember when you made the headlines of The Steambird!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' "Young Samurai Blocks the Musou no Hitotachi!" You captured the public imagination in Fontaine for some time.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' My oh my! I had no idea I was up against such a legendary warrior in our card duel earlier!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' That's all in the past now. I count myself as the fortunate one today for this chance to make so many new friends.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Today is indeed a momentous day to have brought us all together. I propose that I treat everyone to a meal to mark the occasion, if it pleases you all?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh? Sounds like it's victory meal time! Count me in!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' You'll have to excuse me for a moment while I wrap up things at the tournament venue. I'll join you all later.
:{{DIcon}} See you later.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is great! We can have a nice, hearty meal and get a good sleep tonight before heading off to Inazuma tomorrow!
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Inazuma? Does this mean you found a new lead on the card snatcher?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure did! Investigating is what we do best! ...Well, okay, guess luck played a part in it too.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I still have some things to take care of here in Liyue, so I'm afraid I won't be able to accompany you to Inazuma.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, but remember to keep working on your Genius Invokation skills. You never know when Paimon Sensei will show up for a surprise inspection!
:{{DIcon}} You're getting pretty strict, Paimon Sensei.
:{{DIcon}} You really care for your students, Paimon Sensei.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I've also heard some things about this card snatcher you're pursuing.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Already? Wow, nothing gets past Ningguang, huh...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' A new card back appeared on the market recently. It's extremely rare, and bears an image of a treasure chest.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Some players are willing to pay exorbitant amounts of Mora for things of this nature, as they believe they can improve their luck. So I looked into them briefly to see whether there was any genuine commercial value in them.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I quickly learned that every card back with that particular design had been scooped up overnight. There's not a single one left in all of Liyue.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Initially, I thought this might just be another case of a merchant hoarding goods in hopes of maximizing their profits. But once I heard more, I realized it must be the thief you are after.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Is there anything else unusual about these card backs other than their rarity?
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 08.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Unfortunately, since I didn't manage to procure one for myself, I'm unable to say for sure.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 09.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' All I know is that despite being custom-made, they are not particularly exquisite &mdash; if they were, you can be sure I would have purchased one sooner.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hmm... The mystery of this Card Snatcher gets more baffling at every turn...
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It doesn't matter. Given how much he likes to talk to himself, he's sure to spill all his secrets sooner or later.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 10.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Every journey into the unknown is a mystery waiting to be solved. But often, it is encounters with the unexpected that make the journey all the more interesting.
:{{A|vo dpeq002 11 ningguang 11.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' For instance, it was certainly a pleasant surprise for me today to meet top talents from all around Teyvat.

:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' By the way, does Captain Beidou play Genius Invokation TCG, by any chance?

:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Would you mind putting in a word for me, Kazuha? I'm a long-time fan of Captain Beidou's. I've always hoped I'll get to make friends with her some day, but so far I've never had the chance.

:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 brotherqian 03.ogg}} '''Brother Qian:''' Sorry, do you want an answer for the media, or do you want my actual thoughts?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I'd like to hear your actual thoughts, of course.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 brotherqian 04.ogg}} '''Brother Qian:''' *sigh*
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 brotherqian 05.ogg}} '''Brother Qian:''' Well, I've always said that playing cards is seventy percent skill and thirty percent luck... But when your opponent rolls six dice of the same element at once, there's no coming back from that, not even with adeptus-level skills... so there was no hope for a mere adventurer like me.

;(Talk to Ningguang, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I've heard that even the unofficial Genius Invokation tournament is enjoying a huge turnout. Many serious TCG players have registered for both the official and unofficial ones.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' As for me... I don't mind trying my hand at the trending games from time to time, though I still prefer chess.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq002 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' But when it comes down to it, whatever differences there may be between the various games around, they all share one important thing in common: They bring friends together.
