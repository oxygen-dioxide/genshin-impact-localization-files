|text      = The [[Court of Fontaine]] is such an incredible place. Have you seen all the [[Clockwork Meka|meka]]!? Some look like humans, [[Maintenance_Meks|some like fish]], and [[Icewind Suite|others can even dance]]!

Seeing these machines made me think back on some of the hunts I've been on... and then I suddenly remembered that my birthday was just around the corner.

So as I was disassembling a mek the other day, as a way of both remembering the past and celebrating the present, I decided to hold on to a [[Clockwork Meka Material|bunch of usable parts]] — I was thinking I could use them to upgrade my [[bow]] and arrows, or even create a brand-new weapon. But when I asked some craftsmen in the Court of Fontaine, they said that they couldn't be used the way I wanted. Seems like I still have a lot to learn...

Anyway, I've sent you the parts that I picked out along with this letter.

Let's go on another hunt together soon, huh?
