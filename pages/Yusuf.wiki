==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yusuf:''' Great work I've done today!
:{{DIcon}} You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
::'''Yusuf:''' This isn't pride talking. It is a fact.
::'''Yusuf:''' At such a young age, I am already so capable! I can support myself!
::'''Yusuf:''' I work for Ms. [[Sulaykha]]. I do the daily registration every day, and get my pay at the end of the day.
::'''Yusuf:''' If I keep doing this, I'll get paid for life, and I can eat Uncle [[Lambad]]'s fish rolls every day.
::{{DIcon}} That's very... far-sighted.
:::'''Yusuf:''' Of course! You may not know this, but Ms. Sulaykha is a real genius. She was invited to study at [[Akademiya]].
:::'''Yusuf:''' She rejected those block-headed adults, though. She said, and I quote, "Learning is no fun compared to making money."
:::'''Yusuf:''' Ms. Sulaykha also told me that the biggest secret to building wealth is to "stay away from the [[Kalimi Exchange]]."
:::'''Yusuf:''' A genius boss with a caring heart. I should have enough to last me for life!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Are the fish rolls good?
:::'''Yusuf:''' I could eat them every day. You tell me if they're good or not.
:::'''Yusuf:''' Try them yourself if you don't believe me! Lambad's original fish roll will knock your socks off!
::;(Obtain [[Lambad Fish Roll]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} That's amazing.
::'''Yusuf:''' Thank you! I think so too.
