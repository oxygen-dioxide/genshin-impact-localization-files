==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Takeru:''' The village is real dangerous, big (sis/bro). Is there anything that I, Konda Takeru, can do for you?
:{{DIcon}} What kind of dangers lie within this village?
::'''Takeru:''' Heh, since you bothered to ask with such sincerity, allow me to fill you in on the horrors of this place!
::'''Takeru:''' The village is filled with mysterious incidents and dangers. For instance, my grandfather would never let me near that dried well...
::'''Takeru:''' However! I know that the Treasure Whirlpool lies within that well! Greedy treasure hunters would get sucked into the huge, horrifiying whirlpool at the bottom of the well and become trapped by the monsters inside!
::{{DIcon}} Wow, that's really spooky.
::'''Takeru:''' Heh, scared you silly, eh?
::'''Takeru:''' Well, you don't seem ready yet. I mean, look at me! I can already fully take care of myself!
::'''Takeru:''' Someday, I'm gonna become as reliable as someone like [[Ryuuji]]. That way, I'll be able to protect you and everyone in the village!
::{{DIcon}} You mentioned Ryuuji?
::'''Takeru:''' Ryuuji is a hero who once saved my life. He's helping to keep the peace in Inazuma as part of the, uh... the [[Bantan Sango Detective Agency|Manban Sanpou something-or-other]]!
::'''Takeru:''' Once, when I got stuck on a cliff while running around outside, Ryuuji dropped down from the skies and saved me.
::'''Takeru:''' I want to become a great hero just like Ryuuji. That way, I can help my dad who's in the army to fight off all the bad guys in the rebellion!
:{{DIcon}} Are you not going to play with your [[Futaba|"Aunt"]]?
:;(After completing ???)
::'''Takeru:''' "Aunt"? Oh, you mean that old hag? She's such a sore loser - I'm not gonna play with her!
::'''Takeru:''' Every time she loses, she pulls a long face and says "You have to listen to me, you're my nephew." And she's not even as tall as me! Aaand She's always trying to cheat!
::'''Takeru:''' But I won't hold a grudge against her. I'm the man who's gonna become as strong as Ryuuji, after all!
:{{DIcon}} Not at the moment. See you soon.
::'''Takeru:''' Alright then... Well, let me know if you ever need help with anything! Remember, I'm the trustworthy Konda Takeru!
