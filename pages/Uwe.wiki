==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Uwe is a Treasure Hoarder Marksman who disguised himself as a hunter from [[Springvale]], his modus operandi is to get injured in order to take advantage towards unfortunate Travelers.<ref name="Hangout">{{Ref/Quest|Healing Is My Job}}</ref> After defeating the monsters while searching for [[Sweet Flower]]s, Uwe have stumbled upon the [[Traveler]] and [[Barbara]], claiming to be a hunter from Springvale who got injured after being attacked by monsters in the forest, thus pleading Barbara to heal him.

Depending on the chosen dialogues, he will either confess that he is a Treasure Hoarder, yet expresses his gratitude to Barbara for healing his injuries in which he'll be repaying in kind by giving Barbara some Sweet Flowers,<ref name="Hangout" /> or if the Traveler decides to take him to the [[Knights of Favonius]] for being a suspicious person, Uwe will accuse the Traveler of bluffing in which he reveals his ulterior motive, thus eventually causing him to be defeated. Despite that, Barbara still feels a slight remorse for his injuries.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ulterior Motive...?}}</ref>
