<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Uwe is a Treasure Hoarder who operates around [[Mondstadt]]. His modus operandi is to fake injuries in order to take advantage of unsuspecting travelers who try to help him.<ref name="Hangout">{{Ref/Quest|Healing Is My Job}}</ref> However, Uwe was left badly injured for real after encountering a group of monsters, and travelers (wary of his claims) refused to help him. Uwe eventually encountered the [[Traveler]] and [[Barbara]] after they defeated some [[Hilichurls]] in the [[Whispering Woods]] while searching for [[Sweet Flower]]s. Pleading for Barbara to heal him, he claimed to be a hunter from [[Springvale]] who got injured after being attacked by monsters in the forest.

Depending on the chosen dialogue, he will either confess that he is a Treasure Hoarder, yet still express his gratitude to Barbara for healing his injuries and repay her in kind by giving her some Sweet Flowers,<ref name="Hangout" /> or if the Traveler decides to take him to the [[Knights of Favonius]] for being a suspicious person, Uwe will accuse the Traveler of bluffing in which he reveals his ulterior motive, thus eventually causing him to be defeated and run away. Despite that, Barbara still feels slight remorse for his injuries.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ulterior Motive...?}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Uwe appears as a [[Treasure Hoarders: Marksman]], but without the bandana while in dialogue.
