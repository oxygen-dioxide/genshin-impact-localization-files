{{Lang|'''Chouji'''|ja=長次|ja_rm=Chouji}}, full name {{Lang|'''Zushi Chouji'''{{Name Order|Japanese}}|ja=頭師長次|ja_rm=Zushi Chouji}},<ref name="unsealed letter">{{Ref/Item|Unsealed Letter}}</ref> is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Gazing Three Thousand Miles Away}}. He can be found near [[Jakotsu Mine]], [[Inazuma]].

==Profile==
Chouji and his parents lived in [[Higi Village]] until the [[Tatarigami]] began making villagers on the island ill. His [[Chouji's Mother|mother]] was infected with the energy, but unlike many other villagers who succumbed to madness, was apparently unaffected. Regardless, she was still inflicted with fever and bleeding, and departed to [[Sumeru]] with a crew of pirates for treatment.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Pharmacist's Notebook (II)}}</ref> Although she left the [[Unsealed Letter]] for him informing him of the reason for her departure, it was found and opened by an unidentified figure and left in Jakotsu Mine.<ref name="unsealed letter" />

Chouji would live by himself, seemingly unaffected by the Tatarigami, and believed that his parents were not affected by it. Since then, Chouji has been trying to save up [[Mora]] by selling [[Crystal Marrow]] in order to leave [[Yashiori Island]] and search for his parents.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Gazing Three Thousand Miles Away}}</ref> While Chouji's mother wrote to "Uncle" [[Onitaka]] and his pirate crew to take care of her son while she was gone, Onitaka's crew did not arrive to pick him up, as they succumbed to the Tatarigami and would not bring him in until they dealt with the [[Inaba Kyuuzou|samurai]] on the broken boat.<ref>Interactable: [[Pirate's Diary]]</ref>

Sometime later, Chouji met the [[Traveler]] and asked them to bring him Crystal Marrow for reasons yet unknown. The Traveler and [[Paimon]] became suspicious and began asking him why he needed it, as it was being monopolized by the Shogunate. Chouji then admitted that he was looking for his parents, and seeing this, the Traveler and Paimon began helping him acquire Crystal Marrow, and he was eventually able to leave [[Yashiori Island]], eventually departing for [[Snezhnaya]] to look for his mother.

According to the ''Puppy Union Admission Details'' that [[Heizou]] had given to the Traveler during the event [[Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness]], it was revealed that Chouji was one of the many people who were rescued from the warzone, with his codename being ''Weasel Thief No. 12''. He was 8 years old during the events of that war.<ref>Event [[Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness/Story]]</ref>

===Appearance===
Chouji has black hair and black eyes and wears a straw hat.

==Trivia==
* [[Yasumoto]] said he would take care of Chouji after "it was all over," however disappeared due to the player's involvement in helping him find a cure.
* It is heavily implied in the [[Pirate's Diary#Pirate's Diary #2|Pirate's Diaries]] that Chouji's father was not killed, but rather ended up with the very same pirates that Chouji's mother eventually left for [[Sumeru]] with. However, despite the pirates offering to help him find his wife and son, he declined and left.
** This means that Chouji's father is still implied to be in Inazuma, Chouji's mother is on her way to Sumeru, and Chouji himself is headed for Snezhnaya.
