==Trivia==
*Diluc has an unused voice-over for ''About [[Rosaria]]...'': {{A|VO Diluc About Rosaria.ogg}} "Really...? So that's how she feels about the Darknight Hero... *sigh* She's not wrong. At least, not until the darkness has been wiped out of Mondstadt."
*Prior to 1.6, Diluc referenced a nightingale rather than an owl for ''Interesting Things'': {{A|VO_Diluc_Interesting_Things.ogg}} "What? Why do you ask? ...It's a nightingale, quietly watching its prey from the darkness, waiting for the perfect moment to strike... Flawless."
