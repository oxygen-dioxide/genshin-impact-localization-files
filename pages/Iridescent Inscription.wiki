'''Iridescent Inscriptions''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. They take the form of glowing golden patterns, which can be found carved into solid surfaces or floating in the air on their own. They can also be fragmented and reassembled.

==Overview==
The [[Traveler]] can interact with Iridescent Inscriptions by touching them. In response, the Inscription may:
* Lead the player somewhere (similar to a [[Seelie]])
* Activate a mechanism
* Teleport the player to a different location
* Show readable text (like a record)

==Lore==
Iridescent Inscriptions were once used by the ancient [[dragon]]s of Natlan to wield the primal fire, [[Phlogiston]].<ref name="BCR">{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Crystal Rock}}</ref> '''Phlogiston Engravings''' are their modern equivalent, supposedly created by the humans who received Phlogiston from [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]].<ref name="TNT">{{Ref/Quest|Tracer No Tracing}}</ref>

Today, Iridescent Inscriptions have been scattered across Natlan and are thus not a common sight. The people of Natlan can no longer decipher them, but they do understand how they affect Phlogiston on an intuitive level.<ref name="BCR"/>

==Trivia==
* Conflict between Iridescent Inscriptions and [[Abyss]]al power can transform nearby terrain:
** Turning Solid Phlogiston into [[Tutorial/Unstable Phlogiston Crystals...|Unstable Phlogiston Crystals]]<ref name="BCR"/>
** Causing Solid Phlogiston surfaces to constantly shift<ref name="BCR"/>
* [[Saurian]]s may be able to sense an Inscription's power, as evidenced by [[Little One]] in ''[[Beneath the Crystal Rock]]''. This may be due to their dragon lineage.
* [[Iridescent Beam]]s are powered by disordered Iridescent Inscriptions.
