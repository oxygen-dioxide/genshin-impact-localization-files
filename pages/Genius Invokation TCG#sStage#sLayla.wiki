;(When the player defeats two of Layla's Character Cards)

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card layla invite easy 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I finally won... This was my first time trying to use real-time calculations during a card game. I was pretty sure I'd mess it up, but... looks like I managed to pull it off.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card layla invite easy 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I didn't get enough sleep last night, so my head's still all groggy... I just couldn't keep all the numbers in my head.

:{{A|vo card layla ingame hard 03.ogg}} '''Layla''': No, no, no! Oh, this is bad...

;(When Layla defeats one of the player's Character Cards)

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card layla endofgame fail 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' How did I lose? I know I memorized the formula, and I'm sure the values were correct... I guess I just messed up the calculations? I need to go back over this one with a fine-tooth comb...
