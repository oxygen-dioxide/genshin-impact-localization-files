==New Abilities and Attacks==
===Storm Rhopaloceros===
[[File:Hypostatic Symphony Storm Rhopaloceros Plunge.gif|thumb|right|Storm Rhopaloceros Interruption]]
Summons a whirlwind that envelops the entire field, that will be naturally dispelled after some time, or can be interrupted with a plunge attack by an upcurrent generated by destroying an Anemo Seed.
{{clr}}
===Vacuum Burst Weakness===
[[File:Hypostatic Symphony Absorb.gif|thumb|right|Vacuum Burst Interruption]]
If the Pure Anemo Hypostasis absorbs a non-Anemo Elemental Orb while executing "Vacuum Burst", where it absorbs leftover Elemental Orbs on the field to perform shockwaves, its attack will be interrupted and its core will be exposed for an extended period of time.
{{clr}}

==Returning Abilities and Attacks==
For most of the attacks below, the core will be exposed for a few seconds after the boss uses the attack. Use this opportunity to deal damage to the boss.
*'''Clap''': Quickly flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing damage in an area in front of the wall. Dash sideways to dodge.
*'''Crystalfly: '''Flies into the air and turns into a giant crystalfly, then shoots 2 blasts aimed at the player, dealing damage in a large [[AoE]]. Dash to dodge.
*'''Missiles:''' Moves to a location away from the player and floats in the sky, forming a large circle with pieces of its shell. Forms elemental missiles with its shell pieces and fires them at the player. Move around to dodge (can dodge without dashing).
*'''Meteors:''' Moves to a location away from the player and sends pieces of its shell into the sky. Over the next few seconds, creates falling meteors targeting the player's position, which leave updrafts at their location. The boss will '''not''' expose its core after this move, but its core will be exposed during the attack.
*'''Tornadoes: '''Flies in a spiral high into the air, forming a tornado at the center of the arena. Over the next few seconds, forms multiple tornadoes at various locations in the arena, which chase the player when nearby.
*'''Vacuum''': Quickly flies next to the player and forms a ring around its core using pieces of its shell. Sends the pieces flying outward, creating a vacuum which pulls the player toward the center. Shortly after, a large explosion centered at its core deals heavy AoE damage. Dash away immediately when the ring is formed in order to escape the vacuum.
*'''Vacuum Burst''': Teleports next to the player and forms a spinning dome formation with its shell. Every few seconds, absorbs Anemo orbs scattered in the arena  one by one, recovering its HP by 5% each and sends out a large shockwave for each orb absorbed which deals heavy damage. Emits 3 shockwaves total.
*'''Second Wind''': When HP is low (approx. 5%), moves to the center of the arena and forms 4 large Anemo Orbs which float, 1 moving large Anemo Orb, and several updrafts. After some time (approx. 15 seconds), absorbs any Anemo Orbs that remain, healing a large portion of its HP (approx. 15%) for each orb absorbed. Use the updrafts to glide into and dissipate the Anemo Orbs to prevent the boss from healing entirely before finishing it off with another move after it recovers and uses another attack.

==Strategy==
===Low/Mid Tier Route (Storm Butterfly Intermezzo I)===
*Difficulty Level: Expert
*Total Score: 2,745
*Time Remaining: 21s

A rather difficult battle because there is a long time in-between openings to attack. In this case, taking Elemental Skill CD is not advisable as Elemental Skills are crucial to use with these small openings. Some additional concessions have to be made as the variation of CRIT DMG decrease has changed to CRIT Rate decrease, severely crippling damage if taken.

===Low/Mid Tier Route (Storm Butterfly Intermezzo II)===
*Difficulty Level: Expert
*Total Score: 2,700
*Time Remaining: 44s
Be sure to react away the tornados into other elements and/or collect the Anemo orbs leftover on the field as each absorbed during Vacuum Burst restores 5% of its HP. As with the regular Anemo Hypostasis, additional time has to be factored as the Pure Anemo Hypostasis revives once even if you collect all Anemo orbs during its Revival move.
