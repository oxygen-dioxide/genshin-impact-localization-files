==Description==
The feather of a falcon proudly perched on top of an old noble's hat.<br />Hunting with the common folk and sharing the spoils with them was an old tradition.

Commonplace were the hunts, a hobby of the ruling class of Mondstadt.<br />The festivities were shared with their servants and the common folk,<br />As a sign of the benevolence of the nobles.<br />All the people were eager participants in the festivities.

Hunts soon lost their meaning.<br />The nobles everything as their own, presuming it their right.<br />Proudly the feather still stood, yet faded was its color in the people's eyes.
