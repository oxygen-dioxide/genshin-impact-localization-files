{{Description|A pair of earrings made from a single piece of jade. It has a most gentle texture.}}
'''Flowing Rings''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Echoes of an Offering]].

==Description==
[[Chenyu Vale]] is home to many mountains, streams, and stories. Among these, the most famous is:<br />
A long time ago, there was a priceless gem that fell into the hands of a demon and was thrown into the waters where it sunk...<br />
<br />
The wide river of a legend will oft produce many tributaries. One of these goes like this:<br />
This gem was once jade from a sacred mountain, carved into its current shape only by the hand of [[Rex Lapis]] himself.<br />
And the stone that had been lost to the waters may have been a lesser jade, or perhaps just a simple cup.<br />
Some even say that the "jade" in the tale is in fact an analogy for a beautiful person.<br />
<br />
The legends even have it that people had once seen this:<br />
<br />
Unnumbered koi with tails like gems in the sunlight,<br />
Having left the shackles of the lakes and rivers to which aquatic creatures are bound,<br />
Flying freely with the wind in the sky.<br />
So too did the pair of jade earrings belonging to a certain person change form.
