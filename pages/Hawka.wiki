'''Hawka''' is a notorious [[Saurian]] trafficker in [[Natlan]].<ref name="Alibi">{{Ref/Quest|An Air Race and an Alibi}}</ref> He also deals in other materials, such as [[Saurus Crackers]], alchemical ingredients, and [[Strength Tonic|shady potions]].<ref name="Soncoyoc">{{Ref/NPC|Soncoyoc}}</ref> 

He is implied to have significant power and influence; he can apparently procure anything that a client asks for,<ref name="Soncoyoc" /> always gets the Saurian he has his eye on,<ref name="Alibi" /> and has connections at the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]].<ref name="Paran">{{Ref/NPC|Paran}}</ref>

==Profile==
Hawka was once a member of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]], but he and some of his relatives were expelled a long time ago<ref name="Alibi" /> for "doing something terrible"<ref name="24h">{{Ref/Quest|Beat the Clock: 24 Hours}}</ref> (likely related to harming Saurians). 

He is the uncle of [[Paran]], though the two have rarely been in contact.<ref name="Alibi" /> According to Paran, they had some minor clashes in the past, and he does not think that Hawka particularly cares for him. For Hawka's part, he once offered to get Paran a job at the Stadium<ref name="Paran" /> and persistently tries to recruit him into his operation, but it is unclear whether he sees Paran as a family member or a tool.

Hawka is crass towards those he views as below him, calling Paran his "useless nephew" and Soncoyoc an "annoying buffoon."<ref name="Farewell">{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, Final Saurus Cracker}}</ref> He also has no problem with manipulating others to get what he wants &mdash; in ''[[From One Case to Another]]'', he has [[Quilla]] frame Paran for kidnapping [[Oberon]], a young [[Qucusaurus]], in an attempt to paint his nephew as a Saurian trafficker and force him to his side.
