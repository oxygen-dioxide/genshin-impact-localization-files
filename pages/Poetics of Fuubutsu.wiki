'''Poetics of Fuubutsu''' is [[Kaedehara Kazuha]]'s [[4th Ascension Passive]].

==Note==
* While this buff is active, affected characters will have the [[File:Icon Attribute Attack.png|20px]] icon displayed next to their HP bars.
* It can grant multiple Elemental DMG Bonuses at once (for {{Hydro}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, or {{Electro}}) if multiple elements are swirled. However, it does not boost {{Anemo}}/{{Geo}} DMG.
*This talent has unique interaction with Sucrose's Ascension Talent, [[Mollis Favonius]]. Kaedehara Kazuha may get the Elemental Mastery bonus from Sucrose's Ascension Talent, but the Elemental Mastery value used to calculate the Elemental DMG bonus provided from this talent does not take the Elemental Mastery increase granted by Sucrose's Ascension Talent into account. For example, in a party whereby both Kazuha and Sucrose have 100 points of Elemental Mastery each, Sucrose takes advantage of her Talent, thus granting Kazuha an Elemental Mastery bonus of 100 × 20% = 20 points. Kazuha's Elemental Mastery therefore increases to 120. But if Kazuha triggers a Swirl reaction, which in return activates this Talent, he obtains an Elemental DMG bonus of 4% (and not 4.8%).<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/503042 Developers Discussion - 6/30] </ref>
