'''Poetics of Fuubutsu''' is [[Kaedehara Kazuha]]'s [[4th Ascension Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* While this buff is active, affected characters will have the {{Icon|Attribute Attack}} Attack icon displayed next to their HP bars.
* It can grant multiple Elemental DMG Bonuses at once (for {{Hydro}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, or {{Electro}}) if multiple elements are swirled.
* In accordance with [[Loading Screen/Others#Combat|the established interaction between percentage-based stat conferrals]], Poetics of Fuubutsu ignores all Elemental Mastery bonuses that scale off of someone else's stat, such as [[Sucrose]]'s Ascension Talent [[Mollis Favonius]].<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/503042 Developers Discussion - 6/30]</ref>
* Kazuha can trigger this buff off-field.

==Trivia==
*{{Lang|Poetics of Fuubutsu|ja=風物詩|ja_rm=Fuubutsu-shi|ja_tl=Poetics of Scenery and Things}} refers to Japanese poems on natural scenery and the four seasons.<ref>WWWJDIC: [https://www.edrdg.org/cgi-bin/wwwjdic/wwwjdic?1MDJ%C9%F7%CA%AA%BB%ED {{ja|風物詩}}]</ref>
*{{w|Ōtomo no Yakamochi|Ootomo no Yakamochi}}, supposedly the main editor of the ancient poetry collection ''{{w|Man'yōshū|Man'youshuu}}'' ({{ja|万葉集}}), which has the same kanji characters as Kazuha ({{ja|万葉}}), drew inspiration from the ''fuubutsu'' (natural beauties of the season) of a remote region and was good at composing poetry on nature.<ref>Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/大伴家持-39439 {{ja|大伴家持}}]</ref>
