==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
Available before completing ''[[Extreme Weather Disaster!?]]''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Matzahtli:''' Burning biological rain... Wait, could it really be as the legends say? Volcanoes evolving and spreading like living creatures, turning everything around them into more volcanoes? Oh no, no, no! That'd be a disaster!
:{{DIcon}} Volcanoes don't work like that...
::'''Matzahtli:''' Right, right. No magma, no volcano. They can't just pop up out of nowhere. If they could, this place would've been a danger zone ages ago...
::'''Matzahtli:''' But... what if the legend is true? Ugh, if only that self-recording [[Kamera]] actually worked properly...
::'''Matzahtli:''' Wait! What if the Kamera glitches and doesn't catch anything? That'd be a total mess! Nope, I need to go check it out myself, just to be sure...
:{{DIcon}} Oops, sorry for interrupting.
::'''Matzahtli:''' Okay, bye... Or wait, is there something else going on here?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
Available after completing ''Extreme Weather Disaster!?''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Matzahtli:''' So, the biological fire rain is actually those [[Flowfire Bird]]s falling from the sky? Ah, no wonder they cover way more ground than a normal eruption!
:'''Matzahtli:''' Oh no, what if one of them crashes into my house someday? No, I gotta figure out a plan for this.
:{{DIcon}} Well, it's probably just a rare thing.
::'''Matzahtli:''' Yeah, yeah, those Flowfire Birds only get up there because of volcanic eruptions. My house isn't anywhere near a volcano, so I'm probably fine.
::'''Matzahtli:''' But... what if &mdash; just what if &mdash; there's some crazy, massive eruption one day? Wouldn't that mean nowhere is safe? Ugh, no, I still need to come up with a plan... just in case.
:{{DIcon}} Oops, sorry for interrupting.
::'''Matzahtli:''' No worries, you're not interrupting... Anyway, let's start by reinforcing the roof.
