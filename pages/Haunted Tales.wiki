;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo sdeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, the second round of the Test of Courage is about to begin.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon wonders if the shrine maiden knows anything about what [[Heizou]] told us... Let's go ask her.

;(Approach Itto and Shrine Maiden)
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, you guys finally made it!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' I was searching for hours. Still didn't see any sign of those three, so I decided to come back.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' How about you? Find anything?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, it's kinda hard to explain...
:{{DIcon}} We never managed to find those three, either.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' I see... So you came up empty-handed, too.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Well, it doesn't matter! I already came up with a new plan!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What plan?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' [[Shinobu]] told me a saying after she got back from studying in [[Liyue]]. It went something like... "The something by day becomes..." Uhh, something by night?
:{{DIcon}} "The hunter by day becomes the hunted by night."
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Yeah, that's what I said! C'mon, keep up!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Anyway, I was so focused on scaring people last round that those three dressed up as ghosts caught me completely off guard.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' But not this time! Oh no! I'll be hiding nearby and waiting for those three to emerge first, then I'll nail 'em with a surprise attack.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' You two just gotta keep playing it natural and join the contest. Got it? Okay, see ya later!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, Itto! Ugh, he ran off again!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, his plan does make some sense at least... Let's go talk to the shrine maiden so we can join the second round.

;(Talk to [[Hitomi|Shrine Maiden]])
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 01.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Mwahahaha... Congratulations on winning the first round of the Test of Courage.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 02.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Now you're one step closer to the dark, messy truth. But is that really a good thing?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, cut the nonsense! What we just saw was super terrifying!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 03.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Oh, really? Good to hear.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 04.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Hearing the words "super terrifying" is exactly what all us event organizers would like to hear.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh no, that's not what Paimon means! Something mysterious is also happening here, not just the event!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 05.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' So what? You've heard the stories about the Test of Courage, haven't you?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 06.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Everyone who participates in the event faces a variety of emotions.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 07.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' People are afraid of seeing their innermost fears appear before them, yet they still seek the thrill of experiencing those fears.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 08.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' So isn't it natural for us to have things in the dark and deathly silent forest to help fulfill that experience?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 09.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Just like the grinning monster standing behind you right now, waiting for you to turn around...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aaaah!!! Really!?
:{{DIcon}} She's messing with you.
:{{DIcon}} There's nothing behind us.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 10.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Hehehe... I knew a little trick like that wouldn't be enough to scare you off.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 11.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' So, congrats on passing this test. The second round of the Test of Courage will begin shortly.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 12.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Have you found your partner yet?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But don't we already have a partner from the last round...?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 13.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Yes, your team's outstanding effort certainly won you the last round.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 14.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' So it's understandable that you'd want to pair up with your previous partner... But unfortunately, you must find a different partner for each round of the event.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 hitomi 15.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' If you don't have a partner by the time the next round begins, then...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, yeah, Paimon already knows! If we don't have a partner in time, then we'll be disqualified!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's ask around and see if there's anyone looking for a partner!

;(Talk to the Shrine Maiden again)
:{{A|vo dialog sdeq001 hitomi 01.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Have you found a partner yet?

;(Talk to Yoimiya)
:{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Heya (Traveler), Paimon! I had a feeling you two would be here!
:{{Introductory Note|Yoimiya}}
:{{A|vo sdeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, [[Yoimiya]]! You're here too?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Mm-hmm. I was also here for the first round, but I arrived a little early, so maybe that's why I didn't see you.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' By the way, I heard you were the winners. Impressive! I eventually found the hidden [[Dango Milk]] too, but it was already too late.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Actually, Paimon still doesn't know how we managed to find it.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 4 paimon 03a.ogg}} {{A|vo sdeq002 4 paimon 03b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon was just hiding behind {{MC|m=him|f=her}} the whole time, and somehow we won!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' (Traveler), you never told me you were so good at this sort of event... You weren't keeping it a secret, were you?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Anyway, would ya like to pair up with me? We'd be an amazing team! With us working together, the second round will be a piece of cake.
:{{DIcon}} I want to partner up with Yoimiya.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06a 1.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, awesome! Don't worry, you'll see that being on my team is a blast!
::{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06a 2.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Now let's get out there and win this thing... We'll move faster than a firework shooting straight into the sky! It'll be like WHOOOSHHH and the round will be ours!
:{{DIcon}} Let me think about it...
::{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 1.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, I understand. You have to put some thought into choosing the best partner... You did already win the first round, after all.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 2.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But I'm definitely no pushover when it comes to the Test of Courage. I've been to loads of these events.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 4 yoimiya 06b 3.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Besides, choosing me means you'll have one less tough competitor to deal with, hehe! Anyway, give it some thought.

;(Talk to Yoimiya again)
:{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' So, made up your mind yet? Do you wanna team up with me?
:{{DIcon}} I want to partner up with Yoimiya.

:{{DIcon}} I still need to give it some more thought.
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02b 1.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Ah, really? That's a bummer...
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 02b 2.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Well anyway, I'll be right here if you change your mind!

;(Talk to Sayu)
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 01.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' *snoring* Huh? Ah, you found me...
:{{Introductory Note|Sayu}}
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, [[Sayu]]! Are you here for the Test of Courage, too?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 02.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Yes... *yawn*
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She looks like she just woke up... No wait, she's actually trying to fall asleep!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 03.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' The Test of Courage is too scary, so I keep my eyes closed to not feel scared.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 04.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' But as soon as I close my eyes, it's really easy to fall asleep...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 05.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' During the first round, a big bull-headed beast leaped out of nowhere and scared me half to death, so I ran and hid behind a tree.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 06.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' I closed my eyes and tried to hide for a while, but it was really dark and I fell asleep... By the time I woke up, the round was already over.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A big bull-headed beast... Wait, that sounds like [[Ushi]]!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 07.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Now, no one wants to partner up with me for the second round.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, poor Sayu... Wait, but why would you join the Test of Courage in the first place?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 08.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Oh, because I heard that being frightened causes you to grow taller...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What kind of silly idea is that!? That's just a load of baloney!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 09.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' I wasn't sure if it was true, either, but since I heard it could help people grow taller, I decided to give it a shot...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Sayu doesn't have a partner yet. Should we team up with her?
:{{DIcon}} I want to partner up with Sayu.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10a 1.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Really? You're willing to be my partner?
::{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10a 2.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Great... But please keep an eye on me, and don't let me fall asleep again.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10a 3.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' It's pretty scary here, but I'm going to face my fears this time.
:{{DIcon}} Let me think about it...
::{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 1.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' It's okay, no rush. I came here for my own reasons anyway.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 2.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' I'll try to overcome my fear... and sleepiness.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 5 sayu 10b 3.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' But, if you do want to partner up, just let me know...

;(Talk to Sayu again)
:{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 01.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Oh, will you pair up with me for the Test of Courage?
:{{DIcon}} I want to partner up with Sayu.
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02a 1.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Really? You're willing to be my partner?
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02a 2.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Great... But please keep an eye on me, and don't let me fall asleep again.
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02a 3.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' It's pretty scary here, but I'm going to face my fears this time.
:{{DIcon}} I still need to give it some more thought.
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 02b 1.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Okay... If you want me to be your partner, you can find me here.

;(Talk to Thoma)
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hey there! Congrats on winning the first round of the Test of Courage.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Thoma]]! Wait, were you also a contestant in the first round?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I sure was! But I couldn't shake this constant feeling that someone was secretly following me the entire round.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' He didn't seem to be from the [[Yashiro Commission]], and I was concerned that he might be out to stir up trouble at the event, so I tried to capture him.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I didn't expect him to run so fast. I gave chase for a while, but I couldn't keep up... and before I knew it, the round was over.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, is there a chance he wasn't there to cause trouble? Maybe he was just trying to scare people.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 05.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Coming all the way to the Test of Courage to scare people? Well, I guess the world is full of all kinds of weirdos...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 06.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Anyway, I'm gonna be sure to show everyone my abilities in the second round.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon remembers you once mentioned that you like kaidan...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 07.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Yeah, that's right. Once I really get into it, you might find me to be your toughest competitor.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 08.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha, I'm only kidding, of course. I'm not here for the prizes, just to have fun.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 09.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' [[Kamisato Ayato|My lord]] has granted me a rare vacation, so I'd rather spend my time relaxing than worrying about some contest.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 10.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Speaking of which, have you found a partner yet? Would you like to pair up with me?
:{{DIcon}} I want to partner up with Thoma.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11a 1.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Really? Thank you.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11a 2.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I can't guarantee we'll be able to win the second round, but I'll do my best to help. Let's give it our best shot!
:{{DIcon}} Let me think about it...
::{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 1.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Ah, I understand. Hope you can find the right partner and win the second round.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 2.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' You've probably already heard that to win the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]]'s special prize. You have to win all three rounds.
::{{A|vo sdeq002 6 thoma 11b 3.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I'd like to know what the prize is as well... And you're the only one who has that chance now, so go for it!

;(Talk to Thoma again)
:{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha, want to team up with me?
:{{DIcon}} I want to partner up with Thoma.
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02a 1.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Really? Thank you.
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02a 2.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I can't guarantee we'll be able to win the second round, but I'll do my best to help. Let's give it our best shot!
:{{DIcon}} I still need to give it some more thought.
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02b 1.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Ah, not a problem. I still wish you the best of luck, no matter who you chose to team up with.
::{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02b 2.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Just be sure not to put too much pressure on yourself. The Test of Courage is meant to be a fun event, focusing only on winning would defeat the whole purpose of participating.

;(Talk to Shrine Maiden)
:{{A|vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 01.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' You appear to have found a partner. Let's see if you can repeat your luck from the first round.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 02.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Though, whether winning should be considered "good luck" or not is debatable, hehehe...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 03.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Anyway, I will now reveal the item you'll be searching for in the second round of the Test of Courage.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 04.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' It's... a "fan."
:{{A|vo sdeq002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A fan? You mean like the thing we use to keep cool when it's hot out?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 05.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Correct. The fan was personally selected by the Yashiro Commissioner himself, and has been placed somewhere in the [[Chinju Forest]].
:{{A|vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 06.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' There will be signs to guide the way, but beware, the darkness that lurks in the forest is drawing nearer.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 10 hitomi 07.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Mwahahahaha... Remember, if you can't go on any further, you can always give up and live to see another day.

:{{A|vo sdeq002 11 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' And pretty strong ones, from the looks of it. I'll hold on to them! Hehe, they'll come in real handy for the next Onikabuto tournament!

:{{A|Vo sdeq002 12 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' It sounded like it came from inside the shrine.
:{{A|Vo sdeq002 12 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I've heard people say that some evil spirits are sealed in shrines, and at night they make banging sounds from inside.
:{{A|Vo sdeq002 12 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Whenever someone approaches, a spirit will &mdash; POW &mdash; leap out and pull that unfortunate person inside the shrine, using the victim to replace themself{{sic}} as the prisoner!

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, I know! These are all creatures from the Ultimate Youkai Field Guide that granny used to show me!

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 02.ogg}} '''Youko:''' It sure took you long enough to notice.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 kappa 02.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' Well, we recognized you right away! You're an oni, aren't you?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 03.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' According to legends, oni are grouchy, extremely strong, and crush other youkai into balls to eat them up!

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Besides, you're the ones people are scared of! Hiding behind bushes and scaring people off the road, what are you trying to do here?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 06b.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Don't think I didn't see you! ...Following {{MC|m=him|f=her}} around and conjuring up all sorts of weird, scary stuff.

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 kappa 03.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' No, we weren't trying to scare anyone. We were just trying to, uh...

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 04.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Go ahead, you can tell us.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we can help you.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 05.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' Really? You're not mad?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even though you scared the daylights out of Paimon a few times, it doesn't seem like you were doing it on purpose.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, let's hear your side of the story and Paimon will decide whether or not to forgive you!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 04.ogg}} '''Youko:''' Ahem, well, the truth is... we were planning a festival.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 05.ogg}} '''Youko:''' One hosted by the youkai, but humans are also welcome to attend.
:{{DIcon}} You mean, the [[Mikawa Flower Festival]]?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, the festival that [[Ei]] mentioned!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Mikawa Flower Festival... huh, that does ring a bell.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah right, it used to be hosted by the top youkai. I heard it was supposed to be a lot of fun... I mean, not as fun as my [[The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival|Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival]], but still...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 06.ogg}} '''Youko:''' Yes, the Mikawa Flower Festival is our aspiration... But we know that our festival doesn't deserve that name.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 07.ogg}} '''Youko:''' The times of [[Hyakkiyakou]] are long gone, we're just a bunch of little youkai living in the wilderness.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 08.ogg}} '''Youko:''' As you can see, we lack the necessary youkai powers to put on such a grand festival.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 09.ogg}} '''Youko:''' But... we're determined to still reach out to humans and express our gratitude.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Gratitude? What do you mean?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 kappa 04.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' Mm-hmm. You see, we live in the wilderness and are frequently attacked by monsters.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 kappa 05.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' They would come and stir up trouble on our land, forcing us to hand over our food... Sometimes they would even get rough and leave us injured.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 kappa 06.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' But later, many human adventurers came into the wilderness and drove off the monsters, allowing us to live in peace.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, I get it now. You wanna repay the favor, but your powers are too puny!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, don't let it get to ya. You might be a bunch of pip-squeaks, but you're all solid youkai in my book!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So are you the ones who set up the [[Akitsu Yuugei]] game on the beach?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 06.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' Yep, that was us! Have you tried it yet? Isn't it fun?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 07.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' We drew inspiration from the legendary [[Akitsu Haneasobi|Akitsu {{Rubi|Hazura|Haneasobi}}]]. It took a lot of youkai power to set it up.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 08.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' After that, we didn't have much youkai power left, so we set up some stalls in the forest to add to the festival atmosphere...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 10.ogg}} '''Youko:''' We were just following you to see your reactions.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is the Akitsu Yuugei really that important? Why did you spend all of your youkai power to build it?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon would have taken (Traveler) for a big meal if you had set up more food stalls!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 09.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' Really?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 11.ogg}} '''Youko:''' To be honest, we've never met a human before, so we had no idea what you would like...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 12.ogg}} '''Youko:''' We focused on building the Akitsu Yuugei because of a legend we heard.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 11.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, I know the one!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 13.ogg}} '''Youko:''' It's the story of youkai meeting a human during a festival hundreds of years ago.
;(A cinematic plays)
::'''Youko:''' It's said that long ago
::'''Youko:''' A human samurai once stumbled across the Mikawa Flower Festival
::'''Youkai #1:''' What's a human doing here?
::'''Youkai #2:''' We erected the barrier, didn't we? Ugh, what a pain...
::'''Youko:''' The youkai at the festival began discussing
::'''Youko:''' How to drive away the human
::'''Youko:''' When suddenly, they heard a voice
::'''Kamai Kenji:''' This is our festival, and the point is to have fun!
::'''Kamai Kenji:''' What difference does it make if a human joins us youkai!?
::'''Youko:''' The speaker appeared to be a prominent figure among the youkai
::'''Youko:''' And when he spoke, the other youkai fell silent
::'''Kamai Kenji:''' You there, young man. Do you drink sake?
::'''Yanagibashi Takuto:''' ...Yes, I do
::'''Kamai Kenji:''' Hah! Then join us. We can enjoy tonight's festivities together. Haha!
::'''Youko:''' And so, the youkai and samurai celebrated together
::'''Youko:''' The two competed in the highlight of the festival: the Akitsu Hazura (Haneasobi)
::'''Youko:''' Their spectacular game ended in a draw, and a new friendship was forged...
::'''Kamai Kenji:''' Haha, I can't believe a human could keep up with me
::'''Yanagibashi Takuto:''' Witnessing the dynamic powers of the youkai
::'''Yanagibashi Takuto:''' Will certainly help hone my swordsmanship
::'''Kamai Kenji:''' You're a swordsman!?
::'''Yanagibashi Takuto:''' Yes, I'm currently traveling the world in search of formidable opponents
::'''Kamai Kenji:''' Then let's make a deal
::'''Kamai Kenji:''' We meet for a duel every ten years, whaddya say?
::'''Yanagibashi Takuto:''' I look forward to it

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 14.ogg}} '''Youko:''' The Mikawa Flower Festival is meant to bring happiness to all who attend, and Akitsu {{Rubi|Hazura|Haneasobi}} is a symbol of friendship.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 15.ogg}} '''Youko:''' That's why, when we decided to hold the festival here, setting up Akitsu {{Rubi|Hazura|Haneasobi}} was our first priority.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 16.ogg}} '''Youko:''' Unfortunately, the real Akitsu {{Rubi|Hazura|Haneasobi}} has been lost to time. What we created is a version of the game we heard about from a wandering merchant, so we changed the name to Akitsu Yuugei.

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 10.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' Yeah, but that wasn't us!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 kappa 07.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' We have no idea what could have gone wrong!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 17.ogg}} '''Youko:''' We closed Akitsu Yuugei a while ago and carefully checked it for any issues.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 18.ogg}} '''Youko:''' But, we didn't find anything wrong with it... Maybe it was just some strange mishap caused by our unstable youkai power at the time.

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 11.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' After that incident, people stopped coming to the attraction.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 kappa 08.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' Later, a human man with blue hair appeared and walked around the area...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 19.ogg}} '''Youko:''' He had a piercing gaze, I almost felt like he could see us.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 youko 20.ogg}} '''Youko:''' But then he turned and quickly left without saying anything.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 hitotsumekozou 12.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' It wasn't long before large numbers of people began coming to the Chinju Forest!

:{{DIcon}} It must have been [[Ayato]].
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, the fan that Ayato chose is the same kind that's used at a festival... Do you think that he knew about the youkai when he decided to hold the Test of Courage here?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 13.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh, so my bro Ayato is here for the Test of Courage, too?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 14.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Or maybe he's here to catch Onikabuto... Ha, had I known that, I would have brought the one I caught a few days ago to battle him!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Itto's still clueless about who Ayato really is...
:{{DIcon}} It's alright, no need to tell him for now.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well anyway, seems like all the strange things we saw earlier were caused by these little youkai, not ghosts. What a relief...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And now that we know what was happening, the Test of Courage doesn't seem that scary after all!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 15.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, you want to hang out with humans, right? I totally get that.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 16.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' After all, we youkai are becoming a rare breed these days. If all we do is isolate, we'll only feel more lonely. So, why don't you let this oni do ya a favor, hmm?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 itto 17.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' See, I'm a youkai too, right, and I'm already a natural in human society. I bet there's not a single person in Inazuma who hasn't heard of Arataki "The One and Oni" Itto!

:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that Paimon doesn't feel so scared anymore, maybe we can walk around the area?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 57 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The youkai said they wanted to host a festival, but Paimon was too busy having the bejeebers scared out of her to pay any attention until now.

:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When it comes to having connections in Inazuma, nobody can beat Paimon and (Traveler)!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh yeah!? Alright, well then let's have a little contest and see who knows the most people!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure! Bring it on, Bull-Chucker Beetle Boy!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 youko 02.ogg}} '''Youko:''' Ahem... please don't fight. Actually, I think you're both really amazing.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 youko 03.ogg}} '''Youko:''' And you also have a great friendship. Just like [[Kamai Kenji|Lord Kamai]] and the samurai...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Haha, well, of course&mdash;
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 together 01.ogg}} '''Mamoru, Akira, and Genta:''' Boss!!!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh, it's the boys!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Darn it! I was so caught up with the youkai that I forgot I was supposed to scare the daylights outta the gang!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 mamoru 01.ogg}} '''Mamoru:''' Boss!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ahem... hey fellas, look, I can explain, I&mdash;
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 together 02.ogg}} '''Mamoru, Akira, and Genta:''' Boss, we're sorry!!!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Wait, what now?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 mamoru 02.ogg}} '''Mamoru:''' We shouldn't have ever doubted you, Boss. You were right!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 akira 01.ogg}} '''Akira:''' Yeah, the Test of Courage is terrifying! Th&mdash;There are definitely ghosts here!!!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 genta 01.ogg}} '''Genta:''' I still get shivers just thinking about it... But the thrill was kinda fun...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh... uh... hahaha well, I told you it would be an exhilarating experience, but noooo, none of you believed me.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 11.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Anyway, no need to be too scared now. Let me tell you what's happening here...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 12.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' It turns out, there aren't any ghosts here, all the scary stuff you saw was just a little misunderstanding we had with the youkai.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 13.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Right?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 youko 04.ogg}} '''Youko:''' Ah... Sorry, but I've never seen these three before.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 youko 05.ogg}} '''Youko:''' I'm not sure where you've been or what you've seen, but I don't think it had anything to do with us...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 14.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{DIcon}} Huh?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 15.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' H&mdash;Hold on, little Youko... You're kidding, right? You know, now's really not the time for that!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 youko 06.ogg}} '''Youko:''' N&mdash;No, I'm serious. I really don't know what's going on...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 16.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' But if it wasn't you guys... does that mean there are real ghosts out here!?
:{{DIcon}} Wait a minute, we did meet some lady who was all dressed up...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, that's right! Paimon assumed she was a youkai too, and we even played Akitsu Yuugei with her.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 youko 07.ogg}} '''Youko:''' ...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 youko 08.ogg}} '''Youko:''' *gulp* I&mdash;I'm not sure who it was you met...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 youko 09.ogg}} '''Youko:''' But we're the only three youkai who wanted to hold a festival here...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! So she was a ghost?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 together 03.ogg}} '''Mamoru, Akira, and Genta:''' Ah, Boss! Save us!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 17.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Calm down! Everyone j&mdash;just calm down now!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 heizou 01.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' What's all the noise about?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 18.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hmm? Oh, you're the Tenryou Commission's...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heizou!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 heizou 02.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' There's nothing to fear. Even if there really is a ghost, all your noise would drive it away.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 heizou 03.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Itto, you and your gang should go and inform the other contestants about the situation.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 heizou 04.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' (Traveler), Paimon, please come with me.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 itto 19.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh... Okay!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 60 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... Paimon somehow feels a little better now that Heizou's here...
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|After chatting with the little youkai, it turns out that the mysterious woman is not one of them... Who is she?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Akira, Genta, Itto, or Mamoru, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Don't freak out, boys! Whatever happens, I'll protect you!
:{{A|vo dialog sdeq002 together 01.ogg}} '''Mamoru, Akira, and Genta:''' You're the best, Boss!

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayaka, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Could the rumors be true then? Do strange phenomena really happen every time the Test of Courage is held...?
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Please, be careful.

;(Talk to Gorou, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' "Recite this to yourself, keep your mind clear and at peace. Free your thoughts from spirits and ghosts"...
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Those were [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|Her Excellency]]'s remarks in the directive. She once said, "There is nothing to be afraid of as long as your conscience is clear."
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' If only Her Excellency were here. She would get to the bottom of this in no time.

;(Talk to Kaedehara Kazuha, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Unease pervades the air, and fear is spreading
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Maybe this is the real Test of Courage...? It's already becoming an unforgettable experience for me.

;(Talk to Sayu, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 03.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Shh... this is one of my usual hiding spots. It's always safe here.
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 sayu 04.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Let me show you a trick. Just cover your eyes, and the scary things will go away...

;(Talk to Thoma, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I believe my lord had foreseen this situation...
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' He has my absolute trust, but given Lady Ayaka is still here, we must get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.

;(Talk to Yoimiya, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' So is there really a ghost around here?
:{{A|Vo dialog sdeq002 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I'm gonna go look for it. I've never seen a ghost before! Oh, how exciting!

;(Approach the signboard)
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh, hellooo? Miss shrine maiden...? Strange, she isn't here.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Waaaah! What's this? Look, there's something written in red on the bulletin board!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Round 3... Item... {{w|Hagoita}}."
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does this mean that the item we have to find in the third round is a hagoita?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 heizou 01.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' The shrine maiden appears to be urging us to finish the third round of the Test of Courage.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But where did she go?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* Has she been taken away by a ghost!?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Will Paimon be next!? *gulp* Oh, Paimon won't ever leave your side now!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 heizou 02.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' The words are scribbled hastily, but there's no evidence of a struggle. However... aren't there too many words written here?
:{{DIcon}} What did you notice, Heizou?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 heizou 03.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' I believe that the three items chosen for this three-round contest were each selected by the three organizing parties.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 heizou 04.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' The Dango Milk was chosen by the merchant who funded the event, and the fan was chosen by the Yashiro Commission, which provided the staff.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 heizou 05.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' So, does the hagoita, which should have been chosen by the Grand Narukami Shrine, have any unique significance?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's worry about that later. The bigger question is, are we really going to join the third round of the Test of Courage?
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon would love to win the grand prize, but our safety comes first!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How about we... make a tactical retreat!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 heizou 06.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' I still have my commission to complete, so I'll stay.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 heizou 07.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Fear arises from mystery, and it's a detective's job to unearth the truth from the mystery.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon somehow feels a little better after hearing you say that...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay then, let's wait for a while.
:{{A|vo sdeq002 68 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe the shrine maiden had something to take care of and will be back soon...
{{Dialogue end}}
<!--unused - seems like the same lines were used for all branches
* Sayu branch
:{{A|vo sdeq002 32 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, another stall? It sure looks familiar...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 32 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, this is the same stall we saw earlier!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 33 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, it's back again! Maybe it's following us. Ah, help!
* Thoma branch
:{{A|vo sdeq002 48 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, it's b&mdash;b&mdash;back again! Maybe it's following us!
:{{A|vo sdeq002 48 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I'm not sure whose stall this is, but pestering people to buy your stuff is definitely a poor business practice...
:{{A|vo sdeq002 49 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha, I don't think there's any reason to worry.
