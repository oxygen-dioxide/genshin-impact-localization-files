==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arezo:''' I don't think I've ever seen you around here... Are you a new guest here?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Arezo:''' Oh me? I'm Arezo, and I'm... a former researcher in the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]].
::'''Arezo:''' My younger brother [[Hosseini]] and I both got in the Akademiya, but I just couldn't get used to that kind of life...
::'''Arezo:''' My younger brother seems to like it though, so he can do as he likes.
::'''Arezo:''' Anyway, I gave up the life of a researcher and returned to this place, my hometown, to lead a life of comfort without any papers or report meetings!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} To be honest, I'm a little jealous.
:::'''Arezo:''' Jealousy won't make you any happier. If you have a dream, take actions and go for it.
:::'''Arezo:''' But it seems that you are in a hurry. I guess you're busy with something else, aren't you?
:::'''Arezo:''' It's okay. It rains and shines just as flowers bloom and fade. It's never too late to take a break once you've done what you have to do.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Nilotpala Lotus|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Arezo:''' Alright, I hope you enjoy your stay here!
