{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continues from the previous quest)
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, Paimon's been meaning to ask what you meant by "prepared."
:'''Arapurva:''' Nara Avin has not completely remembered. Memories and dreams are both necessary.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 01.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Dreams...
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 02.ogg}} '''Avin:''' But I'll never be able to stand again. Even if I can recover, I don't know how long that'll take.
:'''Arapurva:''' Such worries are not needed here. Nara Avin, you must remember. Dreams are connected to your heart, not your body.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 03.ogg}} '''Avin:''' My heart...?
:'''Arapurva:''' I led you this far, but now Nara Avin must find her precious things by herself.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Huh? He's gone, just like that?
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' It looks like the sky here has changed somewhat.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 04.ogg}} '''Avin:''' My heart...
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 05.ogg}} '''Avin:''' ...!
:;(Avin begins to stand up from her wheelchair)
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 06.ogg}} '''Avin:''' I... stood up.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 07.ogg}} '''Avin:''' It wasn't hard at all, and it didn't feel weird. It was like... how things were before I got sick.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so that means we're...
:{{DIcon}} We're inside a dream.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not our first time in one. Ah, no wonder Arapurva said not to worry... Avin can move freely in this dream.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 08.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Wow, that's amazing, is this... the power of my heart?
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' How amazing! Now we can all look for Arashani together.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' C'mon, let's race! Lemme see how good you really are!
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 09.ogg}} '''Avin:''' I might not have recovered yet...
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 10.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Whatever, let's go! I won't lose, not even to an adult!
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, and off she goes!
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, this was easy. Paimon thought she'd need more time.
:{{DIcon}} I guess that's what they call aptitude.
:{{DIcon}} That's the power of a wish.
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's true. Let's catch up with them.
----
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Avin, optional)
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 avin 11.ogg}} '''Avin:''' (Yoimiya's fast... I was so close to winning.)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Yoimiya, optional)
:{{A|vo xglq203 1 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' (Avin almost caught up to me. She sure is something.)

;(Approach Avin and Yoimiya)
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 avin 01.ogg}} '''Avin:''' *pants* You're... good...
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, if we had run any further, you would've caught up!
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Avin's toe to toe with Yoimiya!
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 avin 02.ogg}} '''Avin:''' I've outrun lots of adults before. Long legs don't necessarily mean you run faster. Training's important, too.
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Haha, I won't even be able to compete with you in a few years.
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hm, let's see... Where should we go next?
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, look! Something's floating up ahead!
:{{DIcon}} It looks like a... star?
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 avin 03.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Does it want us to follow it?
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hmm, maybe. Let's follow it.
----
;(While following the star)
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Want to keep chasing after it? You're not feeling worn out yet?
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 avin 04.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Getting "tired" is part of running, and I love everything about running!

;(Follow the star to the [[Bouncy Mushroom]]s)
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Whoa, there are so many huge mushrooms here. They're big enough to lie on!
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 avin 05.ogg}} '''Avin:''' That's not what they're for. Let me show you!
:{{A|vo xglq203 2 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, so it's for jumping? Watch this!

;(If the player gets lost while following the star)
:{{Black Screen|Losing your way in the dream, you somehow find yourself back at the beginning...}}
----
;(Approach the blue stone)
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is our destination? But Paimon doesn't see an Aranara. Just this big stone.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 01.ogg}} '''Avin:''' I'm so happy... I almost forgot how it feels to be this happy...
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 02.ogg}} '''Avin:''' You know, at first, it felt like my world had shrunk down to a tiny space.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 03.ogg}} '''Avin:''' But as long as I continue moving forward, new sights will always appear in front of me, and my world will keep expanding before my eyes.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 04a.ogg}} <!--{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 04b.ogg}}--> '''Avin:''' Even though I don't know how I did it, I know I have you all to thank.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, that's not important. What's important is that you've remembered the joy of going through the world.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Our memories don't just symbolize our past. They can also shine a light on our future.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Once you find the hope in your heart again, that happiness will come back to you.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 05.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Yes! Thank you, Yoimiya! Thank you all!
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 06.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Let's keep looking for Arashani. It doesn't look like he's here.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Uh, then why would the star lead us here?
:{{DIcon}} This stone really stands out.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 07.ogg}} '''Avin:''' I dunno how to explain this... I don't know what it is, but it feels very familiar...
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 08.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Almost like it's a part of me.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I know!
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Could this stone be your Urstone?
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 09.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Ur&mdash;Urstone?
:{{DIcon}} (Yoimiya's good at ad libbing.)
:{{DIcon}} (I'd almost forgotten about that.)
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' It's a very rare ore that symbolizes a person's aspirations and dreams.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Since you can see it, that means you've found what you've lost.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 10.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Is that how it works...?
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 11.ogg}} '''Avin:''' It's just like in fairy tales... I thought I'd stopped believing in those.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 12.ogg}} '''Avin:''' But I'm glad that I found that belief again.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? Th&mdash;They passed right through!
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Let's go after them!
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Yoimiya! HEY! ...Well, we have no choice.
:;(The Traveler and Paimon follow them through the "Urstone")
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We passed through, but nothing seems to have changed.
:'''Arashani:''' It has been a while, Nara Avin. It really has been a while, yes?
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 13.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Arashani...
:'''Arashani:''' Why do you look sad? Oh. Arashani knows. You are happy.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 avin 14.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Arashani! *sobs*
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Aw, the Aranara sure have a flair for magical journeys.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' They not only helped Avin find her best friend, but they also showed us what an Urstone is.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, um, we have to look for one of our own later &mdash; to make the purest lens.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! It's kinda funny, but Paimon thinks we can actually do it.
:{{DIcon}} That's an adventure for you.
:{{DIcon}} This has been pretty fun.
:{{A|vo xglq203 5 yoimiya 12.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But we have to bring her back to Sumeru City first. Her mother must be worried sick.
:{{Black Screen|The scene before you is akin to a dream. Before you know it, you are returned to where you previously were.}}
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 01.ogg}} '''Avin:''' It... The dream ended.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' We dreamed a most lovely dream.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Don't look so lonely! He's right next to you.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 02.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Arashani! Y&mdash;You're... still here...
:'''Arashani:''' Arashani wants to say sorry. It is not that Arashani did not want to find Nara. Arashani could not remember the time.
:'''Arashani:''' Arashani does not dare enter the city. Arashani did not see Nara Avin, so Arashani thought you had made new friends.
:'''Arapurva:''' That is normal and unavoidable. It is not something to be grieved.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 03.ogg}} '''Avin:''' It's okay, I understand. This happened because I lost sight of myself.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 04.ogg}} '''Avin:''' But I think I understand now. Yoimiya's right. Everyone gets bad luck, but we have to support each other through unlucky times.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 05.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Thanks for helping me rediscover my memories and dreams. I won't let your work go to waste.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe. You've also helped us a lot, so don't be so humble! To be honest, we didn't know where to start with the Urstone.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But now that we're on this track, I think we'll find it easy!
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 06.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Yoimiya, you need this Urstone because you want to see a meteor shower?
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Yep. Oh! Once we find it, you should come with us!
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 07.ogg}} '''Avin:''' If that's how things are...
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 08.ogg}} '''Avin:''' I'm happy to lend you my Urstone.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wha!?
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What just happened? Did you just take... glasses out of your chest?
:{{DIcon}} I have no idea what's going on, either.
:'''Arapurva:''' ...
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hahaha, how'd you know we'd need this?
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 09.ogg}} '''Avin:''' I didn't. I just thought that since you helped me find my precious friend, I should help you using something precious to me...
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 avin 10.ogg}} '''Avin:''' And then the light turned into this. Is this what you needed?
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Thank you. I didn't expect us to solve our problem like this. Alright, time to give it a go!
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Not that I know how to use it, but let's see what my intuition says.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Where are you... Where are you...
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Ooh! I think I see it! Oh, uh... It was pretty obvious.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' C'mon, I'll lead the way. Once we're done watching the meteor shower, I'll accompany you home.
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 12.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Also, thank you for helping us. Actually, let me scrap the pleasantries and give you a heartfelt compliment instead!
:{{A|vo xglq203 6 yoimiya 13.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' You all are great storytellers!
:'''Arapurva:''' Oh, what a coincidence. I would say the same for you, Red Nara.

;(Approach the marked area)
{{Cutscene Description|A swarm of incandescent meteors rise from the foot of the cliff, shooting upwards into the starry sky. Holding you by the hand, Yoimiya bounds off the edge, vaulting into the dazzling meteor shower together. One star among the countless multitudes carries you heavenwards.<br>Infected with your joy and courage, Avin steadily stands with Arashani's assistance. Abandoning the wheelchair, she bravely charges into the flood of meteors. Like you, she is carried aloft by a meteor, and soars freely above the clouds.<br>As the shooting stars gradually begin to dive, Yoimiya falls from her star. As she descends, golden stars explode like fireworks before her eyes, one after the other. Opening your wind glider, you catch Yoimiya, and together with Paimon, Arashani, and Avin, you watch the meteor shower bloom brilliantly against the dark sky.}}

:{{A|vo xglq203 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're waking up already? But Paimon wants to watch more...
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' The meteors we summoned flew up from the ground...
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' They were exactly like fireworks!
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Ah, I could've kept watching that forever. That was the realest, grandest, most magical dream I've ever had!
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon too! Paimon didn't expect you to just pull us onto that shooting star, though.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe~ Honestly, I didn't think about it at all. I just thought it'd be a shame if we didn't try something crazy.
:{{DIcon}} Yoimiya, you...
:{{DIcon}} You already knew that it was a dream.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' You know me. It really doesn't matter to me if our experience was real or a dream.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I really should thank you two, though. You set all this up as a backup plan because you knew that meteor showers are hard to catch, right?
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Don't worry, I loved it so so so much! I think this ranks as the absolute best gift I've ever been given.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh phew, that's good. Paimon was afraid that you might be angry after hearing the truth.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Why would I be? I dreamed about helpful, friendly, cute Aranara...
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I dreamed that we ran and jumped atop large mushrooms, and we discovered Urstone in a very unexpected way...
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' And when I thought we had woken up, the next part was even more amazing!
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' From her heart, Avin brought forth Urstone glasses. We found meteors that flew up from the earth, and we even became one with the shooting stars themselves...
:{{DIcon}} We've been in a dream.
:{{DIcon}} Who's to say we've woken up?
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 12.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' That's right. Dreams themselves may be imaginary, but they're also experiences that can never be relived or replicated.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 13.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' If we were sticklers about truth and fiction, we would've missed out on so much beauty and emotion.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, you sure know your way with words. Paimon's gonna bump you up a few places on the "Paimon's Best Friends" list!
:{{DIcon}} So there's a leaderboard for that...
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, by the way... the Aranara, they don't usually like...
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 14.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh yeah, they're so cute! We really have to thank those lovely carvings.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The wood carvings?
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 yoimiya 15.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Yeah. If we hadn't seen those wood carvings, then we wouldn't have dreamed of such cute Aranara.
:{{A|vo xglq203 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...?
:{{DIcon}} Yoimiya gets it.
:{{DIcon}} I think they're cuter than the carvings.
