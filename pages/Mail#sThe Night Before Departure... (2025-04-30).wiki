|text      = Recently, I've observed a rise in the sales of floral-flavored alcoholic drinks. The varieties used aren't limited to those native to [[Mondstadt]], either.

Although importing the various seeds to cultivate them at [[Dawn Winery|the winery]] is one possible option, I'd rather take this opportunity to travel to other nations. Such fieldwork helps ensure that any decision I make is well-informed.

Meanwhile, I've entrusted the management of the winery's affairs in my absence to [[Elzer]], and Mondstadt has the [[Knights of Favonius]] to defend it. I doubt either matter will require my intervention.

In any case, I won't be gone for long.

But I'm writing this letter anyway, so you don't come looking for me while I'm not in.
