==Introduction==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''''One day, down at Liyue Harbor.'''''
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's legs are tired, so hungry...
:'''Traveler:''' I'm curious as to how flying tires the legs, but moving on...
:'''Traveler:''' We were at the Blacksmith's all morning, I have worked up a bit of an appetite... Shall we check out [[Wanmin Restaurant]]'s latest offerings?
:'''Paimon:''' Wanmin Restaurant again! As delicious as Mushroom Slime Stew is, when are we gonna go for some fancy grub?
:'''Paimon:''' Like... That place!
:'''Traveler:''' Liuli Pavilion? I've always wanted to try, but...
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon! [[Liyue Harbor]]'s like a sacred place for tasty stuff! You have to try the local delicacies!
:'''Traveler:''' But... Doesn't Wanmin Restaurant have local delicacies? Are you trying to say&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' &mdash;No no! Wanmin Restaurant's really great! Please don't give Paimon to [[Xiangling]]!
:'''Paimon:''' Last time she looked at Paimon it was like she was looking at an ingredient or something, it was so scary...
:'''Paimon:''' You changed the subject! Are you seriously not even curious? A restaurant where you need to book so far in advance has gotta be pretty good, right?
:'''Traveler:''' *sigh* I guess you're right. So, do you know how to make a reservation?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon hadn't gotten that far yet... Let's ask the girl at the entrance!
:'''''A few moments later'''''
:'''Paimon:''' Grr... How come as soon as we mention reservation they don't tell us how to do it?
:'''Traveler:''' Could be a "members only" thing? We don't seem welcome either way... Come on Paimon... Paimon?
:;(Childe and Zhongli exit Liuli Pavilion)
:'''Paimon:''' &mdash;Eh? Who's that?
:'''Zhongli:''' Greetings both, long time no see.
:'''Childe:''' Traveler and friend? It's been a while, you're here to eat too?
:'''Paimon:''' Did you guys just have a meal at Liuli Pavilion? Wow... Was it good? Paimon's just a teeny-weeny bit jealous...
:'''Traveler:''' Paimon, you're drooling...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! Right, you two just came out of Liuli Pavilion. Can you tell us how to make a reservation?
:'''Childe:''' A reservation? One word from me and you're good to go.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, really!? Paimon didn't know you also have a nice side&mdash;
:'''Traveler:''' (Interrupting) &mdash;A thousand thanks.
:'''Childe:''' ...But&mdash;
:'''Traveler:''' &mdash;But?
:'''Childe:''' By the look of you, you've just come from the Blacksmith. Can't have been cheap.
:'''Childe:''' I can help you make a reservation, but Liuli Pavilion prices aren't friendly.
:'''Zhongli:''' I can attest to this.
:'''Paimon:''' How do you know we just came from the Blacksmith!? Amazing...
:'''Childe:''' Not telling.
:'''Paimon:''' The Traveler can look for assignments!
:'''Zhongli:''' In order to earn enough [[Mora]] for a meal? A decent and admirable proposal.
:'''Childe:''' Sure thing. Well, once you've earned enough Mora, come find me.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait and see, the Traveler will earn enough for a feast in no time!
:'''Traveler:''' Huh?

==Tutorial==
;(After completing Random Event tutorial and claiming Credits)
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! Before you know it, we'll be rich!
:'''Traveler:''' Uh... You're sure of this how?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon has to know a lotta stuff to be a great guide. Especially about food!
:'''Traveler:''' Still, why would Childe and Mr. Zhongli agree to help...
:'''Paimon:''' No time to lose! Let's find an assignment!
:'''Traveler:''' And another question, why is this all on me? You planning on lifting a finger?
:'''Paimon:''' No time to lose! Let's find an assignment!
:<span style="color:orange;">Congratulations on completing the tutorial, your reward: 10,000 Mora (the reward will be sent via in-game mail within 5–10 minutes)</span>

==Dock==
Assignments at the Dock take 5 minutes.
===Cargo===
''Give me a hand unloading the ship's cargo, will you? I'll make it worth your while. Folks in Liyue are swimming in Mora, I'm about to be rich. &mdash;Anonymous Traveling Merchant''
----
;(Childe's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' A suspicious fellow seems to be checking out the cargo. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Check out the cargo with him.
::'''Childe:'''  Huh? What's so special about this then? Time to get a closer look.
::'''Childe:''' ...Nothing out of the ordinary. Still...
::The suspicious fellow realized a crowd was gathering and left in a fluster.
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment credits +100</span>
:{{DIcon}} Report to the Millelith.
::'''Childe:''' Huh, you sure? I say we just take care of that suspicious fellow ourselves... Then there'd be no need for the Millelith to get involved, right?
::'''Childe:''' And by the time the Millelith arrive on the scene, this fellow wouldn't dare tell another lie.
::'''Traveler:''' ...You're just looking for a fight, aren't you?
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +100</span>

;(Zhongli's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' Just then, a stranger in peculiar garb blocks your path and whispers these words: "The tiger's tail is in a knot&mdash;" Hearing this, reply:
:{{DIcon}} "...Eh-he?"
::'''Zhongli:''' You appear well-versed in avoiding suspicion. May I inquire from whom you've acquired such skill?
::'''Zhongli:''' This fellow is most certainly seeking entry to Liyue Harbor's black market. Their disposition makes that quite evident.
::'''Traveler:''' Black market? Is that where illicit items can be found...?
::'''Zhongli:''' "Illicit" items? Indeed, in theory there should be some.
::'''Traveler:''' ...!
::'''Zhongli:''' For example, the bone shards obtained from Geovishap Hatchlings in the wild around Liyue.
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +100</span>
:{{DIcon}} "...And Paimon's already bubbling in the pot?"
::'''Zhongli:''' It appears that I have yet to fully comprehend the relationship between you and your little companion.
::'''Zhongli:''' Still, even though the meaning of those codewords is unclear, I suspect that fellow is seeking a way into Liyue Harbor's black market.
::'''Zhongli:''' What's more, this companion of yours, ahem... could quite possibly fetch a good price there.
::'''Traveler:''' No, I wasn't... I would never...
::'''Traveler:''' Eh? "A good price"?
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +100</span>

===Inventory===
''Can you help us total up the imports? Rest assured, you'll be reimbursed in Credits for your time. &mdash;Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs''
----
;(Childe's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' Someone wants you to falsify the inventory, promising a lucrative return when the deed is done. You reply:
:{{DIcon}} "I'm not a crook!"
::'''Childe:''' Well, well, you truly are Mondstadt's Honorary Knight. Solid in the face of temptation.
::'''Childe:''' Still, payment in arrears... Hardly a tempting offer in a dog-eat-dog environment. You know what I'm talking about, haha.
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +100</span>
:{{DIcon}} "How many are we falsifying exactly?"
::'''Childe:''' Eh, you sound a little too eager. Good luck haggling.
::'''Childe:''' ...Ooh, I get it. Trying to tease out the truth for your negotiations?
::'''Childe:''' Not too shabby! As the old Liyue saying goes: "The hunter by day is the hunted by night."
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +100</span>
----
;(Zhongli's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' Someone wants you to falsify the inventory, promising a lucrative return when the deed is done. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Refuse the offer directly.
::'''Zhongli:''' A most wise decision. I was not deceived, the promise of immediate gain holds little sway over you.
::'''Zhongli:''' As for our fellow with little regard for contracts ... His day of reckoning will come, do not dwell on it.
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +100</span>
:{{DIcon}} Discuss with Zhongli.
::'''Zhongli:''' To my mind, you would do well to agree verbally, but make sure to note down the evidence in secret.
::'''Zhongli:''' Our fellow with little regard for contracts will not balk at a direct refusal. There are many others willing to take him up on the offer.
::'''Zhongli:''' But in securing the evidence, we will surely be able to convince others of the truth of the matter.

==At 2000 Credits==
<div style="text-align:center">[[File:Event SHTJ 2000 Credits.png|300px|alt=Childe starts a "diplomatic incident"... in his imagination, at least.]]</div>
:'''Childe:''' I love the atmosphere around the dock. The sea breeze on your face, the bustle of people, not to mention...
:'''Traveler:''' Uh-huh?
:'''Childe:''' Peaceful at first glance, but beneath the surface there's something stirring... I'm just bristling for a fight.
:'''Traveler:''' A dock fight... Sounds like the kind of altercation that escalates into a major transnational diplomatic incident.
:'''Childe:''' Haha, I'm just pulling your leg.
:'''Childe:''' Still, a fight over a "diplomatic incident." Just thinking about it gets my blood racing.

==Wanmin Restaurant==
Assignments at Wanmin Restaurant take 10 minutes.
===Ingredients===
''It's no secret that the fresher the ingredients, the greater the dish. Take this, it's Wanmin Restaurant's secret ingredient list. Don't go losing it. &mdash;[[Chef Mao]]''
----
;(Childe's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' On the way to procure the ingredients, you pass a stall thronged with people. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Squeeze your way through to take a look.
::'''Childe:''' Oh? Folk breathing fire? And without the aid of a Vision...
::'''Childe:''' Liyue truly is a den of hidden talents... I wonder if I should report this to Her Majesty the Tsaritsa...
::'''Traveler:''' ...Isn't this just your average street performance?
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +150</span>
:{{DIcon}} Get Paimon to fly up and take a better look.
::'''Childe:''' So... Will we ever see your friend again?
::'''Traveler:''' Must be quite the show.
::'''Childe:''' Strangely, an old Liyue saying just came to me... "What tossed to a dog is as good as eaten."
::'''Traveler:''' ...A dumpling? Well, that certainly holds true for Paimon...
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +150</span>
----
;(Zhongli's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' While procuring the ingredients, you come across a shop where the prices are higher than expected. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Try haggling.
::'''Zhongli:''' Interesting... Small tactical sacrifices for a better overall outcome. It seems you'll part with less of your Mora.
::'''Zhongli:''' Nevertheless, if one must always consider Mora before acting, then in all things one is bound by Mora. Untainted profit is hard to come by.
::'''Traveler:''' I'd say... the price of never considering Mora before acting might be higher.
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +150</span>
:{{DIcon}} Shop around.
::'''Zhongli:''' Your judgement is well-placed. The [[Jueyun Chili]]s at this establishment are fresher and brighter than those we saw at the beginning. I can almost smell the dry fragrance after they're thrown into the pan...
::'''Zhongli:''' Oh? And cheaper too? More for your Mora?
::'''Zhongli:''' Indeed... Another way of assessing this matter.
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +150</span>

===Cooking===
''Which cuisine? How far in advance to place the order? Too many questions. Isn't it enough to just make our customers happy? &mdash;Chef Mao''
----
;(Childe's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' There's a racket coming from inside the restaurant. A patron who has been drinking all day is causing a disturbance. If it goes on much longer, there won't be any patrons left. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Have a drink with them.
::'''Childe:''' Put down the cup.
::'''Childe:''' Pretty smooth but you won't fool me, you're clearly not old enough to drink.
::'''Childe:''' Let me handle this. I think... a good thrashing should bring them back to his senses.
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +150</span>
:{{DIcon}} Let Childe deal out some punishment.
::'''Traveler:''' ...
::'''Childe:''' ...
::'''Childe:''' Nice! It's about time I got the muscles working again. All this excitement's going to my head...
::'''Childe:''' I'm thinking, so as not to ruin the ambience and keep the boss on my side... I can probably make do with just a fraction of my usual strength?
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +150</span>
----
;(Zhongli's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' "Nobody understands Yue and Li Cuisine better than me!" ...Turns out Yue and Li Cuisine enthusiasts are having a dispute at the entrance. Seeing this, your reaction is:
:{{DIcon}} "None of you know a darn thing about food!"
::'''Zhongli:''' An eloquent conjecture... At least, those enthusiasts didn't seem to disagree with you.
::'''Zhongli:''' Still, I'm beginning to see the merit of such boldness of spirit.
::'''Zhongli:''' The young Wanmin Restaurant chef is a fine example.
::<span style= "color:orange"> Assignment Credits +150</span>
:{{DIcon}} Allow Zhongli to convince them to leave.
::'''Zhongli:''' Four more [[Black-Back Perch Stew]]s, if you please.
::'''Traveler:''' Huh?
::'''Zhongli:''' I gave those enthusiasts a pertinent suggestion: "Why not let your enemy's dish do the talking rather than yourself?
::'''Zhongli:''' Since Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk are fully booked for the next three months, seize the opportunity to try the Wanmin Restaurant specialties.

:'''Traveler:''' Do you prefer spicy dishes, Mr. Zhongli?
:'''Zhongli:''' I wouldn't say I have a particular preference, why do you ask?
:'''Traveler:''' You seem partial to the Wanmin Restaurant's Black-Back Perch Stew...
:'''Zhongli:''' Compared to the regular restaurants, the Black-Back Perch Stew here makes use of [[Violetgrass]] to achieve an exceptional fragrance. Truly wonderful.
:'''Zhongli:''' Such humble and subtle divergence can be the difference between victory and defeat.
:'''Traveler:''' The ability to perceive such subtlety is the mark of quiet wisdom, Mr. Zhongli.
:'''Traveler:''' Or perhaps Mr. Zhongli has more preferences than he admits?

:'''Random Event:''' Stage fright! You're so nervous you've forgotten how the story develops. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Glance at Childe and hope he saves the show.
::'''Childe:''' Wow, I see you all enjoyed it! The people of Liyue really are too kind, they were only a few tales from my homeland.
::'''Traveler:''' Most people lead ordinary lives, your tales must seem incredible to them.
::'''Childe:''' But I didn't even get to the one about the abyssal monsters!
::'''Traveler:''' I think you've done enough. Open your mouth again and [[Tea Master Liu Su]] will write you into one of his stories.

:'''Random Event:''' Stage fright! You're so nervous you've forgotten how the story develops. You decide to:

::'''Traveler:''' Mr. Zhongli, your story seemed a little more detailed than the script.
::'''Traveler:''' Almost like you'd experienced it yourself...
::'''Zhongli:''' Liyue's thousands of years of history have been painstakingly recorded in ancient texts. I just have a good memory, that's all.
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +300</span>
:{{DIcon}} Improvise.
::'''Zhongli:''' On stage just now, you mentioned a friend by the name of "Ice Walker"?

:{{DIcon}} Ask Childe for ideas.
::'''Childe:''' So? Well-rested?
::'''Traveler:''' ...
::'''Childe:''' The heat of battle warms up the muscles and the mind. I find that's the best rest rest there is.

::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +300</span>
:{{DIcon}} Have a casual chat with Childe.
::'''Childe:''' Tales of my homeland? Hmm, let me think...
::'''Childe:''' You ever heard of "ice fishing"? You chisel a hole in a frozen lake, sit down beside it, and cast your line into the water... Sound dull? It's actually an ingenious way of cultivating your patience. A warrior must have patience.
::'''Childe:''' Have I ever fallen into the hole? Haha, not a chance.
::'''Childe:''' But ice-diving is a real test of stamina, I can assure you.

;(Zhongli's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' You've hit writer's block. The right amount of rest should help to draw new inspiration. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Ask Zhongli for ideas.
::'''Zhongli:''' Restful pastimes? Appraising antiques, admiring flowers, attending the theater... I make time for all of them.
::'''Traveler:''' Sounds expensive...
::'''Zhongli:''' And yet... A stroll through the city in good company allows both for rest and a greater understanding of life in its various forms.
::'''Traveler:''' Good to have a less Mora-intensive option.
::'''Zhongli:''' Still, the last time I paid a visit to [[Mingxing Jewelry]] there was mention of a particularly rare thrush. Perhaps we might go and&mdash;

:'''Traveler:''' So you're a fan of public performances like this?
:'''Childe:''' Yes, I'll always find time to take in a public performance. When the mood takes me, I sometimes get on stage myself.
:'''Traveler:''' Ha! I remember in another world I once came across a type of performance with no words and invisible objects. They called it "miming"...
:'''Childe:''' Huh. Sounds interesting...
:'''Childe:''' Why don't we try some of this "miming" ourselves. Invisible swords would really give the other Harbingers something to think about. Hahaha.
:'''Traveler:''' I'm not sure Paimon would be up for it.
:'''Childe:''' Haha, I understand. You wouldn't want to make a spectacle of your best friend, after all.

::'''Childe:''' "This Novel is Amazing!"?
::'''Traveler:''' I heard it's a very popular novel-writing contest help by Inazuma's Yae Publishing House.
::'''Childe:''' Interesting... Perhaps there's a gap in the market for a fighting contest... We could call it "This Sword Strike is Fantastic!". What do you think? Fighting it out to your heart's content in a justifiable context.

::'''Zhongli:''' Poverty is simply life in one of its various forms. His method is flawed, but at least he has given himself the illusion of spiritual self-righteousness.
::'''Traveler:''' If we're making judgments based on Mora, then would Mr. Zhongli consider himself rich or poor? He never seems to bring his wallet with him...

::'''Zhongli:''' Eight eyes... And where did you receive this information.
::'''Zhongli:''' The Mighty and Illuminated Adepti invariably take the form of beasts. The description of them having "three eyes and five hands" is entirely metaphorical, oft <!--spelled as is in-game--> taken out of context by imaginative children.
::'''Zhongli:''' For thousands of years, the adepti were cut off from the rest of the world, having nothing to do with the affairs of humans. This, I believe, is where the imagination began to take a hold.

::'''Childe:''' (Softly) This is nothing. I remember the wound that left me between life and death...

;(Zhongli's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' Whilst filling out the prescription, you notice that one of the ingredients has been obscured by an ink blot. You think you can make out the consonants "g" and "l", as well as the vowels "a", "e", and "i". You guess that:
:{{DIcon}} Violetgrass, perhaps?
::'''Zhongli:''' Violetgrass. Enjoys a moist environment and is best picked after it rains. Can be used in cooking.
::'''Zhongli:''' Confirming whether Violetgrass is indeed correct will require another prescription from Herbalist Gui.
::'''Zhongli:''' Though I'm no stranger to herbal medicine, when it comes to treating somebody, one can never be too careful.

:{{DIcon}} Could it be Glaze Lily?
::'''Zhongli:''' Dihua Marsh used to be full of Glaze Lilies. It is a sort of joyful flower that listens to human song.
::'''Traveler:''' What if you can't carry a tune?
::'''Zhongli:''' Confirming whether Glaze Lily is indeed correct will require another prescription from Herbalist Gui.
::'''Traveler:''' What if you can't carry a tune...?
::'''Zhongli:''' ...Though I'm no stranger to herbal medicine, when it comes to treating somebody, one can never be too careful.

;(Childe's random event)
:'''Random Event:''' As a show of gratitude, a customer has left behind a few herbal bandages. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Give them to Childe.
::'''Childe:''' Liyue herbal bandages? For me? Thanks.
::'''Childe:''' To my mind, battle scars are medals of honor &mdash; the true mark of a warrior. I don't go covering them up.
::'''Childe:''' Good of you all the same, I'm sure I'll find a use for them.
::'''Childe:''' ...On that note, how about a quick skirmish, just the two of us?
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +1000</span>
:{{DIcon}} Give them to Paimon.
::'''Childe:''' So, does your flying friend bump into the occasional tree?
::'''Childe:''' I guess it's harder to fly straight on a full stomach, hahaha.
::'''Childe:''' "Good for emergency rations"? You two make quite the pair.

:'''Random Event:''' As a show of gratitude, a customer has left behind a few herbal bandages. You decide to:
:{{DIcon}} Give them to Zhongli.
::'''Zhongli:''' Bandages... For me? I think you may have greater need. I... seldom get hurt.
::'''Zhongli:''' But your kindness should not go unappreciated, I will take them. In exchange, please have this [[Qingxin]].
::<span style="color:orange">Assignment Credits +1000</span>
:{{DIcon}} Give them to Paimon.
::'''Zhongli:''' The friendship between you is certainly not of a contractual nature.
::'''Zhongli:''' Still, your companion seems unable to appreciate the universal value of things.
::'''Traveler:''' Paimon is my best friend, after all.
::'''Zhongli:''' So it seems. There is a kindness in the mutual teasing I observe between you that defines your friendship.

:'''Paimon:''' Finally! Fine dining at Liuli Pavilion... Here we come!
:'''Traveler:''' If you're the one who obviously wants a feast, why is it that I'm the one who has to do all these assignments?
:'''Paimon:''' Childe and Mr. Zhongli are helping too, aren't they!?
:'''Traveler:''' You're the one who should be helping... Besides, why are Childe and Mr. Zhongli helping us in the first place?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Oh, Paimon knows why! They were deeply moved by your passion and determination! Yeah! It is you after all.
:'''Traveler:''' ...It's me?
:'''Traveler:''' Right... We should invite Childe and Zhongli to join us. It would only be common courtesy after all the help they've given us.
:'''Traveler:''' Let me count here... Hmm, this should be plenty to cover a meal for the four of us, with enough left over to even purchase some other goods.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, Paimon will go round everybody up! In the meantime, why don't you give this wild Cryo Slime we caught to Xiangling. Paimon's starting to drool just looking at it...
:'''Paimon:''' See you at Liuli Pavilion!
:'''Traveler:''' (l can't seem to shake a bad feeling about all this... Wonder why...)
:'''''The Traveler hurries to Liuli Pavilion and finds Zhongli and Childe waiting in a private room.'''''
:'''Childe:''' You're here at last, the food's already starting to get cold.
:'''Zhongli:''' Please, have a seat and enjoy yourself. Paimon's already ordered all the food.
:'''Traveler:''' Paimon ordered the food?
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon and sit down already! See? All your favorites! Nobody knows your taste better than Paimon!
:'''Traveler:''' These really are some of my favorite dishes... I honestly expected to see a table full of Slimes.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Would Paimon ever do something like that? Besides, Paimon already asked the waiter &mdash; no outside ingredients allowed...
:'''Childe:''' Oh, is that so? Then how did you manage to get in here?
:'''Paimon:''' Heyy!! You're lucky Paimon's in a good mood, so we'll let that one slide this time.
:'''Paimon:''' These dishes here were Mr. Zhongli's recommendation, the [[Adeptus' Temptation]], for example! Mm, it smells so good!
:'''Zhongli:''' This is an intricate dish that is quite famous in Liyue. Rumors have it that even the Adepti themselves are reluctant to return from the mortal world after trying this dish.
:'''Childe:''' Save all the chit-chat for later. We mustn't let any of the food go to waste, so dig in!
:'''''An hour and a half later.'''''
:'''Paimon:''' It's no wonder this place has a reputation for the best Li cuisine in all of Liyue.
:'''Traveler:''' It's so good, I have tears of joy.
:'''Paimon:''' Those days when we were living outdoors and eating in the wild seem like a faraway dream now.
:'''Childe:''' Good thing I've been practicing my chopstick skills. Otherwise, I wouldn't get a single bite in before a certain someone finished everything off.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Are you trying to say Paimon doesn't have any manners?
:'''Childe:''' Not when it comes to eating.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, that's it! You're really asked for it this time!
:'''Zhongli:''' Come to mention it, I certainly hadn't anticipated that you would honor your word and use all your hard-earned Credits to treat us to a meal.
:'''Childe:''' Yeah, the true Hero of Mondstadt. I thought Paimon was kidding when she first made the promise.
:'''Childe:''' It certainly feels good to be treated to a meal every now and then. Thanks a lot!
:'''Zhongli:''' Yes, thank you for your generous hospitality.
:'''Traveler:''' Wait a second...
:'''Traveler:''' All of my...?
:'''Traveler:''' Paimon!?
:'''Paimon:''' Umm... Well, you know, they say wealth is just another worldly possession. You can always just take some more assignments! Besides, Paimon is your best friend!
:'''Traveler:''' *sigh* Sometimes I just don't know what to do with you, Paimon.
:'''Childe:''' Well, either way, this was quite the meal.
:'''Zhongli:''' ...
