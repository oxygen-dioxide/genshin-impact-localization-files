'''Eroch''' was a former Inspector for the [[Knights of Favonius]].

==Profile==
After [[Crepus]] was killed as a result of using his [[Delusion]] to stop [[Ursa the Drake]] from killing his son [[Diluc]], Eroch ordered Diluc to cover the incident up to protect the Knights' reputation. Diluc was enraged at this order and promptly left the Knights and set out to uncover the truth himself.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|9}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|3}}</ref>

Eroch subsequently took the credit for Ursa the Drake's defeat for himself. However, [[Jean]] discovered his scheme and reported it to [[Varka]], who conferred her with the authority to punish Eroch as she saw fit.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|All's Well That Ends Well (Quest)|note=A Letter With Rough Handwriting}}</ref>

When Diluc returned four years later from his investigation, he learned that Eroch had been discharged as a traitor. Eroch's status is currently unknown, although his allies continued to attempt to subvert the Knights from within.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Jean|Vision}}</ref>
