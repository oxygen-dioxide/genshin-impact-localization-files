==Personality==
{{Quote|"The Knave," Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers. A poised, ruthless diplomat. To the children of the House of the Hearth, she is their feared yet dependable "Father."|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
As one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]], Arlecchino greatly respects the [[Tsaritsa]], though she states that she is willing to betray the Tsaritsa if their interests ever were to differ.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Arlecchino|About the Tsaritsa}}</ref> Arlecchino is working to achieve her goals by acquiring the [[Gnoses]] on her behalf. She handles Fatui matters with utmost importance and comes off as graceful and cordial.

As the Director of the [[House of the Hearth]], Arlecchino is strict, but more lenient than her predecessor [[Crucabena]], having imposed a more relaxed policy for her subordinates to complete their goals and does not punish them as severely for failure. She appears to have a soft spot for children, seeing that many members of the House of the Hearth are young and orphaned children taken in across Teyvat and views them all as her "children," becoming particularly angered when their well-being is threatened or manipulated.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Freminet|5}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Lyney|Vision}}</ref> While she does not like betrayal, she is not as cruel, as she was willing to spare traitors who demonstrated sufficient willpower by "executing" their identity in the House rather than outright killing them. Despite being a woman, she is addressed as "Father" by the House of the Hearth's members; this is implied to be a rejection of Crucabena's ways, who called herself "Mother" and faked affection for the House of the Hearth's children while brutally mistreating them.

Arlecchino is disliked by her fellow Harbingers, who believe her to be violent and crazed beneath her stoic exterior.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About The Knave}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Wanderer|About The Knave}}</ref> These appear to stem from biased accounts of Arlecchino's past spread by [[Pulcinella]],<ref name="breeze">{{Ref/Quest|Sea Breeze Rendezvous}}</ref> with whom Arlecchino shares a mutual dislike.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Arlecchino|About The Rooster}}</ref> Arlecchino allows these rumors about her to persist, as she believes deception to be a useful tool.<ref name="breeze"/>

Despite claiming to be a Fontainian, Arlecchino actually hails from [[Khaenri'ah]]. Arlecchino knows little about her origins, only knowing she had some kind of cursed fire running through her veins from a young age. All she does know was related to her by [[Pierro]] when she joined the Harbingers.

==Appearance==
{{See also|Moonglare}}
Arlecchino uses the [[:Category:Tall Female Characters|tall female]] model. She sports black eyes with red "X"-shaped pupils and layered black and white hair, styled in a long ponytail with asymmetrical bangs.

{{Quote|"Fate grants favors to no one. Only those who would fight it with every ounce of their being may earn the right to challenge it."|[[Pierro]], "The Jester"}}
To this day, Arlecchino still recalls that night when she was first appointed as a [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Harbinger]].

Up the stairs and down the long gallery, with naught to see through the windows but a world of ice and snow without end.

The biting wind wailed loudly, now as mirthful laughter, now as somber farewell—

With a start, Arlecchino came to, the hallucinations of her memory mingling with the sounds of real-life conversation that surrounded her.

The hearthfire burned with vigor, its gentle warmth pervading the room, and its red light glowed on the children's faces, lighting up their innocent, unaffected smiles. If some uninformed passerby were to stumble in at this precise moment, they would surely mistake the scene before them for that of an ordinary, happy family.

But just as Arlecchino raised her steaming cup to take a sip of scalding-hot black tea, the clock began to chime — and within an instant, the laughter and cheer that filled the room were banished. The flames flickered so that for a moment the light faltered, the faces of all present cast in somber expression.

Placing her cup back down, Arlecchino stood up, and in a calm, measured tone, called out several names:
"[[Chapleau]], you're with [[Lyney]]. Retrieve the required intelligence. [[Foltz]], you and [[Filliol]] are on guard duty. Stay back and tend to the Hearth..."

"Yes, 'Father.'"
Without a redundant syllable, nor a hint of hesitation, they answered as one.

Not long after, the fire had dwindled and the house fallen utterly silent, with nothing to be seen but a single shaft of infiltrating moonlight, peeking through a gap in the curtains upon a cup of gradually cooling tea.

              --><p>This continued until last year, when [[Freminet]] was given a nasty shock by a lizard that leaped down from the ceiling. The little "invader" was caught by [[Lynette]]'s sharp eyes and quick fingers and then imprisoned on top of the table by a bowl she swiftly seized.</p><!--

==Trivia==
* The names of several of Arlecchino's Talents come from book titles.
** Her Normal Attack [[Invitation to a Beheading]] is named after the {{w|Vladimir Nabokov}} novel ''{{w|Invitation to a Beheading}}''.
** Her "Masque of the Red Death" state is named after the {{w|Edgar Allan Poe}} short story ''{{w|Masque of the Red Death}}''.
* Arlecchino is the first character whose attack animations are uniquely distinct with a specific weapon; in her case, the [[Crimson Moon's Semblance]].
* Arlecchino has unique walking and running animations compared to other tall female characters.
* Arlecchino shares the same English voice actress, Erin Yvette, with [[Idyia]].
* Arlecchino's pet spider was named Bambi, a reference to the {{w|Bambi|Disney film of the same name}}.
* Arlecchino, who has the title "Dire Balemoon" and ties to the [[Crimson Moon Dynasty]]<ref>{{Ref/VO|Arlecchino|More About Arlecchino: V}}</ref> along with new and full moon imagery, was released shortly after April 2024's full moon, which happened during [[Version 4.6]]'s Version Update maintenance<!-- note that moon phases happen at the same time for everyone even if they can't see the moon, so it doesn't matter that it was daytime in Asia and they couldn't see the full moon when maintenance happened -->.<ref>Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory: [https://aa.usno.navy.mil/calculated/moon/phases?date=2024-04-06&nump=4&format=p&submit=Get+Data Dates and Times of Primary Phases of the Moon from April 8 to May 1, 2024 UTC]</ref>
** Coincidentally, a full moon in April is popularly known in English as the Pink Moon.
* Arlecchino is also known by these aliases or titles:
** The Knave<ref name="A Tea Party Most Thorny">{{Ref/Quest|A Tea Party Most Thorny}}</ref>
** The Fourth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers<ref name="A Tea Party Most Thorny"/>
** "Father"<ref name="Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights">{{Ref/Quest|Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* In ''{{w|commedia dell'arte}}'', a type of Italian theater, "{{w|Harlequin|Arlecchino}}" (Harlequin) is an astute servant, often acting to thwart the plans of his master and pursuing his own love interest, Colombina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.
** This seems to match with Tartaglia's belief that she'd turn against the Tsaritsa (her master) in a heartbeat if it benefited her.
* The name Arlecchino derives from "{{w|Alichino (devil)|Alichino}}," a demon that Dante places in the Divine Comedy as part of the Malebranche, a group of demons guarding the Bolgia of Barrators. Both Alichino and its English translation (harlequin), are in turn inspired by the demon ''Hellequin'' (also called Annequin, Hennequin or Hannequin), present in many legends and popular traditions of France and Provence.
* One of Arlecchino's titles, "Otets," derives from the Russian word {{ru|Отец|father.}}
* Arlecchino's real name, Peruere, likely comes from the Latin, ''perurere'', which means "to burn" or "to be consumed by fire."
** The name is likely also a reference to the in-game novel, [[Perinheri|Hleobranto Innnamorato]], in which the main character is named Perinheri.
