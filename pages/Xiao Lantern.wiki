==Trivia==
*The {{Lang|Xiao Lantern|zh=霄灯|zh_rm=Xiāodēng}}, while using the same name as the English name for {{Lang|[[Xiao]]|zh=魈|zh_rm=Xiāo}}, is actually based on {{Lang|mini=1|zh=霄|zh_rm=xiāo}}, which can mean "sky."
** The two words are pronounced identically in Chinese. Based on the emphasis on [[Xiao]] for this event, this is probably intended wordplay.
** {{Lang|[[Lantern Rite#Xiao Market|Xiao Market]]|zh=霄市|zh_rm=Xiāoshì}} also uses {{Lang|mini=1|zh=霄|zh_rm=xiāo}}.
