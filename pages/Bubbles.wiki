'''Bubbles''' are objects that can arise from [[Ley Line Disorders]], [[Auras]], or from attacks from certain enemies ([[Hydro Abyss Mage]], [[Large Hydro Slime]], [[Hydro Hypostasis]]).

Bubbles deal {{Color|Hydro DMG}} on impact and will trap the player inside, causing the same [[displacement|immobilizing]] effect as [[Mona]]'s [[Stellaris Phantasm]]. These bubbles can also trap small enemies as well as apply the {{Color|Wet}} status to any enemies on contact.

==Getting Trapped==
If the player gets trapped in a bubble, they will be unable to attack or switch to other characters and a red button will appear on the right half of the screen. Players can repeatedly press this button (mobile devices), the X button (PlayStation) or the space bar (PC) to break free from it.

==Popping and Avoiding Bubbles==
A certain retaliation for this attack is very simple, the homing bubble itself is very fragile when in contact on anything with a hitbox aside from the player. Using [[AoE]] or ranged attacks can help pop it from a distance, or the player can lure the bubble towards another target (enemy or object).

Other possible methods to avoid bubbles include:
*Running away until the homing bubble pops by itself due to its duration (not recommended when a timer is present)
*Popping the bubble using a bow user, or any mid-ranged abilities such as [[Zhongli]]'s [[Dominus Lapidis|Geo Construct]]'s shockwave
*Breaking the bubble using a solid hitbox entity aside from the player, such as {{Color|[[Geo Constructs]]}} or [[Amber]]'s [[Baron Bunny]].
*Manipulating the bubble into bumping with another bubble to make both pop at the same time, or letting it touch your own enemies or the summoner.

==Trivia==
*Certain [[event]] items feature bubbles that can be summoned to use against enemies:
**[[Inquisitive Endora]] during the [[Wishful Drops]] Event
** Hydro Mechanici during the [[Theater Mechanicus]] Event
