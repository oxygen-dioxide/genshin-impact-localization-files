But such things will not dissuade the star-faring Traveler from journeying here...

==Unofficial Notes==
;Unofficial List of Changes
#Removed the [[Fatui Anemoboxer Vanguard|Anemoboxer Vanguard]]'s Geo counter as the counter was designed to mimic the Swirl reaction which does not react with Geo.<ref>Chinese HoYoLAB: [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2147378 Official Future Versions Plan]</ref>
#Also added the Special Dishes [[Woodland Dream]] and [[Prosperous Peace]].
#Added in Missing Person Posters to [[Liyue Harbor]] that were notably absent after the related story, but also removed all of them from [[Mondstadt]].

;Unofficial List of Fixes
#Fixed the names of all Talent Level-Up Material books to no longer have quotation marks. For example, [[Guide to "Prosperity"]] has been renamed to just [[Guide to Prosperity]].
#Fixed the names of some other items:
##Apple Cider Vinegar has been renamed to [[Apple Cider]]
##[[Countryside Delicacy]] has been renamed to [[All-Delicacy Parcels]]
#Fixed the description of some food items like [[Mushroom Pizza]] that incorrectly stated that they heal all party members.
#Fixed the issue where [[Noelle]]'s Talent description for [[Breastplate]] displays %% in its Healing Triggering Chance.
#Fixed the issue of non-standardization of [[Namecard]]s and [[Achievements]] categories by adjusting all of them to use colons (:) instead of dashes (-) in their names.
#Fixed the description of most places including [[Weapons]], [[Artifacts]], [[Talents]] and [[Tutorials]] descriptions to read "opponent(s)" rather than "enem(ies)". However, there are still some descriptions even within those areas that state "enem(ies)".
#Fixed the error of funeral director [[Hu Tao]] being referred to as Master Hu instead of Director Hu in various instances.
#Fixed the error of [[Eclipse Dynasty]] being referred to as {{Not a Typo|Blacksun Dynasty}} in various instances.
#Fixed the error of the person [[Gold]] being referred to as him instead of having an unspecified gender in various instances.
#Fixed the error of [[Seelie]] Courts being referred to as Seelie Gardens.
#Fixed the issue where details of materials needed for forging in the forge list couldn't be viewed with a controller.
#Fixed the issue where the Crafting Bench says Cook instead of Craft.
#Fixed the issue where if you scroll down the craft list in Mondstadt and exit [[Timaeus]] snaps his head to looking straight ahead and then to you within a second like his head snapped by smoothening the transition.
#Fixed the [[Wolf of the North Challenge]] to respawn its spawn marker instead of it being unavailable to redo until weekly reset.
#Fixed the [[Pressure Plate]] East of [[Stone Gate]]'s Waypoint to always spawn instead of it randomly despawning.
#Fixed some landscape gaps at the [[Thousand Winds Temple]] and the [[Golden House]] exteriors that allowed players to clip into unintended areas.
#Fixed the issue where at the two huge statues below the [[Mt. Tianheng]] waypoint you could see a ring of grass in the sky where the [[Jade Chamber]] was after completing the story.
#Fixed the issue where newer characters like [[Zhongli]] and [[Xinyan]] were missing from the Character Archive.
#Fixed the description of [[Achievements]] that stated "cook "special" dishes" to "cook suspicious-tasting dishes" to avoid confusion with the specific Special Dishes that each character can cook.
#Fixed Control Type such that after logging in, if a controller was plugged in, it is immediately usable without opening settings to rechange from a defaulted keyboard to controller.

;Unofficial List of Bugs
#There are still some Talent descriptions that state "enem(ies)" rather than "opponent(s)".
#Searching for a special character, such as "(" on the Tutorials section in the archive and selecting the returned "Tile Text" false debug entry whether by cursor movement or exiting and entering the Tutorial section results in the game softlocking with no way to exit until the game is restarted which brings it back to normal.
#Healing Bonus and Healing Effectiveness are being used interchangeably on the character base stat screen and artifacts.
#Switching characters and/or using Elemental Bursts that shift one's position greatly such as [[Fischl]]'s [[Midnight Phantasmagoria]] while standing on [[Confront Stormterror|Stormterror]]'s neck still sometimes results in clipping through and respawning away from the neck.
#The Hydro Mimic Squirrel in [[Rhodeia of Loch|Oceanid]]'s boss arena reads "Hydro Mimic Ferret" when scanned with [[Elemental Sight]] when it is clearly a squirrel and not a ferret.
#Geo Constructs like Geo [[Traveler]]'s still can't be placed on [[Rhodeia of Loch|Oceanid]]'s boss arena.
#In some instances, the [[Defense Mechanism]]s on [[Skyfrost Nail]] can spawn embedded into the ground with only the top of them showing, making them easy pickings as they can't move.
#The light indicator of selected character sometimes does not appear in Party Setup while using a controller.
#[[World Quests]] accepted from the [[Reputation]] NPC don't display their rewards on the quests in progress screen.
#On the first claiming of an [[Expedition]] reward for every [[Katheryne]] conversation, the cursor goes back to the 4h mark even if it was a 20h expedition instead of being 20h mark.
#Claiming any reward from the [[Battle Pass]] with a controller resets the cursor to Lv.1 instead of remaining at the reward level claimed.
#The [[Adventurer Handbook]] mistranslated Common Enemies to Easy Enemies in English while every other language says Common.
#The location navigation of common enemies located via the [[Adventurer Handbook]] can't be cancelled once that enemy's navigation hints goes into cooldown. The only workaround is to then select navigation to a permanent boss such as a Hypostasis and then cancel navigation on the map which strangely works fine for them.
#[[Dark Iron Sword]] is still missing from the [[Archive]].
#[[Keqing]]'s "About [[Xingqiu]]" line is missing for the English dub.
#The button for Blur Distance and Blur Radiance adjustment in Take Photo shows Left Bumper and Right Trigger when it should be Left Trigger and Right Trigger.
#Sometimes the mouse cursor does not appear when holding Left Alt until after the Character Wheel is brought up by pressing Tab.
#Sometimes the map cursor does not appear when the map is accessed with a controller.
#There is no button to view the total time to resin refill timer on the map with a controller.
#If the shortcut key to hover over the [[Spiral Abyss]] position (left dpad) is pressed on the map, pressing the access button brings up the pin window instead of Spiral Abyss details. If a pin is then made at that position, the map will temporarily lose all pins and display 0/99 until the map is exited and returned to upon which the pins will be back as if nothing wrong happened. However, deleting two pins at the Spiral Abyss position will also trigger the 0/99 temporary bug, requiring one to exit and reenter the map window to clear them two at a time.
#Co-Op mode sometimes displays no rooms to join if the player had set join request settings to Reject Join Requests.
#There is some speculation that bringing up the pause menu screen still lets some events tick in the background (such as lightning strikes during a thunderstorm) resulting in FPS drops if left on the pause screen for a long time in some areas.
#Sometimes changing Control Type in [[Settings]] to Controller is not possible on the settings screen despite plugging in a controller until the game is restarted.
#Detaching a controller does not automatically switch Control Type in [[Settings]] to Keyboard resulting in being unable to interact with the game until then.
