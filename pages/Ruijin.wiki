:{{DIcon|Theater}} I'll play a round.
:;(Opens Theater Mechanicus menu)
:{{DIcon}} What's Theater Mechanicus?
::'''Ruijin:''' Theater Mechanicus is new kind of board game that I just invented.
::'''Ruijin:''' All you need to play is a table a few game pieces, and a game master.
::'''Ruijin:''' The objective of the game is to use various strategies to withstand the monster attacks. At least, that's the main idea for now...
::'''Ruijin:''' But who knows, if any more good ideas come to me, I'd like to expand the game's content even more.
::'''Ruijin:''' It'd be great to add things like exploring ruins, or solving evil plots... If all goes well, the game could potentially become like a true adventure in another world.
:{{DIcon}} How much does it cost to play?
::'''Ruijin:''' Well, I've only just finished designing this board game and would like to hear what people think of such a game.
::'''Ruijin:''' So during the Lantern Rite, it won't cost anyone a single Mora to play. All you need is Xiao Lantern and you can play one round.
::'''Ruijin:''' If you'd like to give it a try, just let me know.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ruijin:''' Farewell. If you'd like to give Theater Mechanicus a go, just let me know.
