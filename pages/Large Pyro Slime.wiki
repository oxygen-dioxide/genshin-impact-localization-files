{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Ignited State
|desc_1 = While in the ignited state, the Large Pyro Slime will be inflicted with the {{Pyro}} status indefinitely. Triggering certain [[Elemental Reactions]] on a Large Pyro Slime will extinguish it.
* 4 [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauges]] of {{Hydro}}, or 16 gauges of {{Anemo}}/{{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}/{{Geo}} must be applied to extinguish the Large Pyro Slime.
* Additionally, every time the Large Pyro Slime takes {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, it will immediately reignite, regardless of the amount of Pyro gauges applied or the amount of DMG dealt. Therefore, due to the [[Swirl]] and [[Overloaded]] reactions' ability to deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, {{Anemo}} or {{Electro}} on their own are unable to fully extinguish it.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A monster created by the sedimentation of Pyro dispersed throughout nature.<br>Though its intelligence has not increased with its size, it is very hot. During dry seasons, it can cause wildfires. It will spit forth blazing fireballs when angered, and will turn dark when it is feeling down. A most expressive slime, indeed.|[[Archive]]}}
