==Great War of Vengeance==
<noinclude>{{See also|Timeline#Great War of Vengeance}}
''The term "great war of vengeance" is derived from [[Neuvillette]]'s [[Neuvillette/Lore#Vision|Vision]] Character Story.''</noinclude>

===Sal Vindagnyr (Dragonspine)===
* A group of people seeking refuge from a land of snow and strife<ref group="Note" name="Snow and strife"/> find a bountiful and green mountain. They erect a monument on its peak and establish a civilization there, naming it [[Sal Vindagnyr]], and the mountain Vindagnyr. Over time they built a large and extravagant castle on the mountain.<ref name="Frostbearer"/><ref name="Snow-Tombed Starsilver"/><ref name="First fresco"/>
** Starsilver is an ore that is native to Vindagnyr, as the [[Snow-Tombed Starsilver]] was created long before [[Durin]] crashed onto the mountain.<ref name="Snow-Tombed Starsilver"/>
* The civilization has a large white tree of great significance, and the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|princess]] is born under this tree. Her mother, the priestess, passes her blessings on to the princess, which include the ability to foresee events in the future.<ref name="Frostbearer"/>
* At some point later, the princess has a dream of Durin spreading poison upon the land. The people fear that this prophecy is a curse upon them.<ref name="AnCar"/>
* For some unknown amount of time, Celestia is moored above the mountain of Vindagnyr.<ref name="Fresco of the Skyfrost Nail"/>
* '''~6000 years ago'''<ref group="Note" name="Celestial Nails"/> ― The [[Skyfrost Nail]] descends from the skies, shrouding the city with clouds and snowstorms.<ref name="Frostbearing Tree"/> One day, it shatters into three fragments, one of which turns the Irminsul tree into the [[Frostbearing Tree]]. The outlander Imunlaukr is living in the kingdom at the time, and the princess gives him a [[Snow-Tombed Starsilver|greatsword]] made of starsilver as he leaves to find answers. She promises to make a fresco for him, hoping to meet again.<ref name="Snow-Tombed Starsilver"/><ref name="Second fresco"/>
* The princess is working on a fresco and her father, the priest, goes up the mountain for guidance since the trees are starting to wither. He hopes that the princess' third painting will be of melting snow, but unfortunately she's unable to finish the painting. The Skyfrost Nail splits in three pieces, then fragments further, releasing three orbs that freeze particular locations, including shattering the white tree. The princess takes the most complete branch and tries to graft it onto another tree, but it withers and she dies next to it. Someone else comes along trying to heal the leylines, but is unable to and buries the princess.<ref name="Frostbearer"/><ref name="Snow-Tombed Starsilver" /><ref name="AnCar" /><ref name="Priest's Box"/><ref name="Princess' Box"/><ref name="In the Mountains"/>
* Imunlaukr returns, finding everyone dead. He stores the greatsword made of starsilver among the frescoes and then goes off to fight in a war since he's decided Celestia only cares for bloodshed.<ref name="Snow-Tombed Starsilver"/>

==Interim Period==
<noinclude>{{See also|Timeline#Interim Period}}
''While not formally established as its own period in time, Liyue lore indicates there was a stretch of peacetime between the Great War and the Archon War. ''</noinclude>

===Old Mondstadt===
''Note: Very little information exists about the region of Mondstadt before the fall of [[Decarabian's Mondstadt]] during the [[Archon War]].<ref group="Note">{{Ref/Book|History of Kings and Clans: Prologue}}<br>Starts recording Mondstadt's history from the Age of Kings, which is the war between Boreas and Decarabian; whether the Northland Historical Society has any record of history before that is unknown.</ref> As a result, the order of events and information listed may be highly inaccurate.''
* '''? years ago''' ― An ancient civilization in the [[Windwail Highland]] area establishes [[Cecilia Garden]], where they grew [[Cecilia]] flowers in greenhouses.<ref name="Cecilia Garden"/>
** Based on the architectural and ornamentation style of the ruins around Cecilia Garden, it may have been constructed by [[Decarabian]] or people from his civilization. However, there is currently no textual evidence of any link between Cecilia Garden and Decarabian's Mondstadt.
* '''? years ago''' ― An ancient civilization at [[Starsnatch Cliff]] establishes the Sommernachtgarten. When the civilization fell, the Sommernachtgarten was buried underground and became [[Midsummer Courtyard]].<ref name="Midsummer Courtyard"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― At some point, [[Boreas]], known as the King of the North Wind (or some variation thereof), gains his powers from an ancient god<ref name="Andrius"/> and becomes a god himself.<ref name="BWMT"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― Decarabian establishes his capital city, Mondstadt,<ref name="Venti 3"/> in the area now known as [[Stormterror's Lair]].<ref name="Tile of Decarabian's Tower"/> His territory expands to the [[Brightcrown Mountains]] and [[Windwail Highland]] areas, going as far south as the [[Teleport Waypoint]] between [[Dawn Winery]] and [[Stone Gate]].<ref group="Note" name="Decarabian style"/>
** Brightcrown Canyon was once filled with Decarabian's soldiers, guarding the entrance to the city. The city, meanwhile, was arranged in a circular formation around Decarabian's tower. Residents were assigned their own spots within the city.<ref name="TTG1"/>
** Decarabian's tower &mdash; which is already located in a very deep valley compared to the rest of modern-day Mondstadt and Liyue &mdash; extends even deeper into the ground. However, attempting to reach the bottom level of the aboveground portion of the tower results in an abrupt black screen, after which the player will find themselves on the wind current ledge above it and see unique out-of-bounds dialogue from [[Paimon]]: ''"Watch out! Don't go near there!"''
* '''? years ago''' ― The region of Mondstadt is filled with blizzards, turning it into an inhospitable wasteland. It is caused by Boreas,<ref name="RoB"/><ref name="Spirit Locket of Boreas"/> although whether it was intentional or not is somewhat ambiguous.<ref group="Translation Note" name="Blizzard"/> To protect his city from the blizzards, Decarabian creates a storm wall around it.<ref name="Venti 4"/>
<!--** ''Note:'' It is currently unknown when or why Boreas' blizzards began. While it is possible that the "land of snow and strife," which the settlers of Vindagnyr came from, is Mondstadt, there is currently too little information to draw any conclusions. For example, the snow and strife may be related to the god that Boreas received his powers from.-->

===The Age of Kings===
{{See also|Decarabian's Mondstadt}}
''?–2600 years ago''

* '''>~2600 years ago'''<ref group="Note" name="War start date"/> ― [[Boreas]] declares war on [[Decarabian]], but fails to land even a scratch on Mondstadt.<ref name="Fragment of Decarabian's Epic"/> The war between the two Kings of Ice and Frost<ref name="History of Kings and Clans: Prologue"/> turns into a stalemate,<ref group="Assumption" name="Kings of Ice and Frost"/> and Decarabian's people begin to view his rule as one of despotism and tyranny.<ref name="BOG"/>
** A boy only known as the [[Nameless Bard]] befriends a tiny, insignificant wind spirit that would later become [[Barbatos]]. The boy dreamt of seeing birds in flight, green grass, and the world outside the city.<ref name="Venti 3"/>
** The clan now known as the [[Gunnhildr Clan]] once dwelled inside Mondstadt. However, [[Gunnhildr]]'s father, the clan's leader, grew disillusioned by Decarabian's despotic control and led his people out of the city. Outside the city was only relentless cold and engulfing blizzards, however, and the clan struggled to survive. As they prayed for salvation, a wind spirit that would later be known as [[Barbatos]]<ref group="Assumption" name="Wind spirit"/> responded to their prayers,<ref name="BOG" /> as did [[Istaroth]].<ref name="SacFrag"/> The clan's faith in the spirit empowers it, granting it more powers that it uses to create a shelter for them.
** The first wines are brewed in Mondstadt when a certain mischievous wind spirit takes the form of a fox and ferments some apples under a negligent guard's care. When the guard awoke, he bit into one of those apples and, finding that he enjoyed the flavor, squeezed the sack that contained the apples to create wine.<ref name="ADT"/> Also brewed in ancient times was a wine said to make a person forget the past, used so the people could have the strength to keep surviving.<ref name="HSD1"/>
** Inside Old Mondstadt, people who grew discontent with Decarabian's rule began planning a resistance. The "Windblume" was used as a code word amongst the resistance, with the [[Red-Haired Warrior]] among the first to use this codeword.<ref name="WindOde"/>
** [[Leonard]] the Adventurer invents the wind glider. His life goal is to scale Pilos Peak (now [[Musk Reef]]), but he fails his attempt and is forced to turn back. He writes the book "[[Of Mountains and Seas]]" as an account of his journey.<ref name="UnrecStars4"/><ref group="Assumption" name="Leonard"/>
** Boreas realizes that his blizzards could not nurture life and decides that between his powers and his disillusionment with human society,<ref name="Boreal Wolf's Cracked Tooth"/> he did not have the qualifications to become one of the Seven Archons.<ref name="Boreal Wolf's Nostalgia"/> He chooses to allow his physical body to die while his powers flowed into the land of Mondstadt to nourish it.<ref name="Spirit Locket of Boreas" /> Despite losing his original physical form, Boreas' spirit remains extant and his powers are still strong enough that he can manifest a body of ice and wind.<ref name="Tail of Boreas"/><ref group="Assumption" name="Boreas death"/>
* '''2600 years ago''' ― Decarabian's people rise up in rebellion, led by the [[Nameless Bard]], [[Barbatos]] (then known as the "elf" or "wind spirit"), Decarabian's former lover [[Amos]], a knight (originally referring to the [[Red-Haired Warrior]], now possibly referring to Gunnhildr),<ref name="AB"/><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Rebellion knight"/> and the Red-Haired Warrior.<ref name="Freedom-Sworn"/> The [[Gunnhildr Clan]], led by its current namesake [[Gunnhildr]], also participates in the battle.<ref name="BOG"/> Decarabian is slain in the battle, as are Amos<ref name="Story Teaser: The Boy and the Whirlwind"/> and the Nameless Bard.<ref name="Venti 4" /> With Decarabian's death, Barbatos is elevated to godhood himself.<ref name="Venti 4"/><ref name="BOG"/> He uses his newfound powers to create a vessel in the form of the Nameless Bard's, and takes up the bow in honor of Amos.
** The Red-Haired Warrior, for reasons unclear, turns his back on Barbatos and his name is eventually forgotten by the people of Mondstadt, though his deeds are still remembered. He eventually has a family that would eventually produce [[Ragnvindr]] and the [[Ragnvindr Family]].<ref name="WindOde"/>
** Using his powers, Barbatos reshapes Mondstadt, using his winds to blow away the snow and ice covering the land and terraforming the region of Mondstadt in the process.<ref name="Venti 4" /><ref name="Along with Divinity - Prologue"/><ref name="MNG - P"/> Among the notable changes to Mondstadt's landscape was the eradication of Pilos Peak, which was turned into the modern-day Musk Reef.<ref name="UnrecStars4" /> He then takes his people from Decarabian's old city and moves to Cider Lake, where they build the modern [[city of Mondstadt]]. Prominent clans among them are:
*** The Gunnhildr Clan,<ref name="SacSword"/> led by Gunnhildr,<ref name="BOG"/>
*** The Imunlaukr Clan,<ref name="SacGreat"/> whose leader at the time is unknown, and
*** The Lawrence Clan,<ref name="SacBow"/> led by [[Venerare]].<ref name="RoyalGrim"/>
** Istaroth worked alongside Barbatos for Mondstadt's protection, and both were worshipped by the people of Mondstadt as old as the "winds of time,"<ref name="Ragged Notebook (Time and Wind)"/><ref name="Thick Notebook"/> with the belief that "Anemo brings stories while Time nurtures them."<ref name="SacSword"/> However, at some point in time, the worship of the Istaroth as well as most records of them disappear and are forgotten.<ref name="SacFrag"/>
* '''? years ago, after the establishment of Mondstadt''' ― Seeing that his people had enough wisdom and strength to live on their own, Barbatos departs so he would not be able to become a tyrant.<ref name="Venti Bonus"/>
** The [[Windblume Festival]] is established in memory of those who fought for freedom during Decarabian's reign. The codeword Windblume became conflated with literal flowers,<ref name="WindOde"/> while the festival became one about finding love.<ref name="Ode to Flower and Cloud"/>

===Mondstadt's Aristocratic Period===
{{See also|Mondstadt Aristocracy}}
''2600–1000 years ago''

====Early Aristocratic Period====
''2600–1600 years ago''

* '''<2600 years ago''' ― [[Dvalin]], an elemental dragon, is born from pure {{Anemo}} energy located in the high heavens. The birth of an elemental dragon is a rare occurrence, and such dragons are equal in strength to the gods; historically, they have come to blows with the gods of old. However, Barbatos befriended Dvalin and the dragon became the first among the Four Winds to be worshipped by humanity.<ref name="BAF1"/>
* '''? years ago'''<ref group="Assumption" name="Hexenzirkel"/> ― The [[Hexenzirkel]] challenged Barbatos into a fight, but he refused and offered to resolve the conflict through song instead. From then on, they became allies, and Barbatos agreed to conceal [[Hexenzirkel's Island in the Sky|one of the group's meeting place]] and its lantern.<ref name="Joy Above the Clouds"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― Barbatos departs, and a class of aristocrats blessed with divine powers arose as leaders of Mondstadt. The clans in the aristocracy derived their lineages from heroes who lived during the early ages of Barbatos' Mondstadt.<ref name="NobObl"/> Known clans include the [[Lawrence Clan]], [[Gunnhildr Clan]], and [[Imunlaukr Clan]].<ref name="Sacrificial Series"/>
** [[Venerare]], leader of the Lawrence Clan at the time, built the Barbatos Statue in front of the [[Favonius Cathedral]] to commemorate Barbatos' descent. Beneath the statue was an inscription written by the leaders of the clans, pledging their defense of Mondstadt.<ref name="RoyalGrim"/>
* During this time, the people of Mondstadt worshipped both Barbatos and [[Istaroth ]]. However, at some point, the Istaroth and the worship of them were forgotten by the people of Mondstadt.<ref name="TAW"/>
* Many of the festivals and customs in Mondstadt were enacted by the aristocracy for the betterment of the common people.<ref name="NobObl" /> Such festivities included:
** Hunting, a regular hobby of the aristocracy in which they worked alongside the common people and shared the spoils.
** [[Ludi Harpastum]], a 15-day festival which celebrates the blessings of wine, song, and flight Barbatos bestowed upon the people of Mondstadt.<ref name="MNG - P"/>
** [[Windblume Festival|Windblume]], a festival that celebrates the Thousand Winds.
** [[Weinlesefest]], a festival that celebrates the return of the Anemo Archon when the west wind blows every fall during the harvest season.
* '''2600–500 years ago'''<ref group="Note" name="First Field Tiller"/> ― The incident known as "The Tyrant's Final Fury" occurs.
** For about one year, the first [[Field Tiller]] shot missiles from [[Stormterror's Lair]] at anyone who approached.<ref name="dishonorable trial old stories"/> The first Field Tiller had wandered into the abandoned tower of Decarabian after being damaged by [[Lupus Boreas]], who mistook it for a challenger when it wandered into his arena.<ref name="dishonorable trial old stories"/><ref name="A Soul Set Apart"/>

====Late Aristocratic Period====
''1600–1000 years ago''

* '''? years ago''' ― [[Ursa the Drake]] starts terrorizing Mondstadt.<ref name="MNG - P"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― The Lawrence Clan became the foremost clan in Mondstadt and became the main rulers of the city.<ref name="MNG - P"/> However, they grew corrupt and fell to degeneracy, eventually becoming tyrants who enslaved and tormented the common people while viewing themselves as overlords and kings.<ref name="SacBow"/>
** The Gunnhildr Clan allegedly maintained its honor,<ref name="BOG"/> but were less influential than the Lawrence Clan which ruled Mondstadt. The status and fate of the Imunlaukr Clan are unknown, while other clans among the aristocracy followed the Lawrence Clan's lead.
* '''? years ago''' ― The aristocracy used various methods to control the people and keep them ignorant. Anyone who posed a threat to their reign was enslaved and used for labor or entertainment;<ref name="NobObl"/><ref name="LOV1"/> knowledge of the past was suppressed, and cultural and historical relics that would point towards the truth were taken down.<ref name="RoyalGrim"/>
** The knight order at the time, who referred to themselves as the "starlit knights," served the aristocracy and upheld its degeneracy, using their strength to oppress the commoners.<ref name="Venti Bonus"/><ref name="BOTS1"/>
** The royal mages no longer instilled virtue in the nobles, and instead helped them keep the people ignorant. The Church also used their influence to justify the aristocracy's actions and keep the commoners from realizing the truth.<ref name="TMT"/><div id="Vennessa"></div>
** The [[Church of Favonius]] suffers a schism, with the higher-ranked clergy backing the nobility.<ref name="Soyears ago"/>
* '''>1010 years ago''' ― [[Vennessa]] and her younger sister [[Lind]] are born into a nomadic tribe of the southern plains, exiled from its homeland for reasons unknown.<ref name="LOV1" /><ref name="AquFav"/>
** '''1010 years ago''' ― After running afoul of [[Ursa the Drake]] and being starved by the dragon over the course of several days, she and her people flee to Mondstadt, only to be enslaved by the aristocracy.<ref name="MNG - P" /> Because of her great strength, Vennessa was made into a gladiator, bound by chains. The chains themselves could not bind her; as a child of [[Murata]], Mondstadt's ordinary-quality ores and lack of her homeland's divine flame meant its metals were nothing before her strength. What kept her subservient was her responsibility to her people.<ref name="Shackles of the Dandelion Gladiator"/>
* '''~>1000 years ago''' ― [[Eberhart]], an illegitimate heir to [[Landrich]]'s clan, was a particularly manipulative and ruthless figure who lived at the end of the aristocratic era. He grew up in a noble home with his older half-brothers, [[Parsifal]] and [[Ingbert]]. Due to his illegitimacy, he was never looked on the same way as his older half-brothers which bred discontentment within Eberhart. He also knew how far the aristocracy had fallen from its golden days and sought to restore the ancient aristocracy's glory. To this end, he used his cunning to become a key figure in the aristocracy's downfall.
** '''? years ago''' ― Eberhart goaded his older half-brother Parsifal's love of chivalry and play-acting,<ref name="AIJ3"/> convincing him to become a Phantom Thief, then deceived him in some unknown manner, forcing Parsifal to flee Mondstadt and removing him from the line of succession.<ref name="FavLance"/>
*** During the late Aristocratic Period, spears and polearms came to be viewed as weapons used by lowly commoners and slaves, likened to gladiators' weapons compared to the noble and elegant sword. However, Eberhart secretly trained to use one in order to overthrow the aristocracy,<ref name="Royal Longsword"/> and even became the disciple of the witch who created the [[Crescent Pike]], using her love for Parsifal to get close to her before discovering her weakness and killing her.<ref name="FavLance"/><ref name="CrePike"/> It appears that he took up the lance to gain an element of surprise against Ingbert, a Vision user, who would have easily bested him in combat otherwise.<ref name="AIJ3"/><ref name="Ragged Records"/><ref group="Assumption" name="Ingbert"/>
* '''>1000 years ago'''<ref group="Assumption" name="Wanderer's Troupe disbanding"/> ― The [[Wanderer's Troupe (Faction)|Wanderer's Troupe]] is established, comprised of people from all over Teyvat.<ref name="Stringless"/> It was both a musical troupe and a militaristic troop, gaining the moniker "Swordsman's Troupe" as they traveled throughout the continent. At one point, they faced an unknown foe in the [[Mare Jivari]], and they made their final stop in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. They tried and failed to overthrow the aristocracy, and most of its members were slain during the battle, enslaved afterwards, or fled.<ref name="WT"/><ref name="WS"/> Known members include:
** The founding member was the [[Conductor]] who wielded [[The Widsith]], a collection of the Troupe's travels and musical compositions. He was slain in battle.<ref name="WS" />
** The [[Sojourner]], also known as the harpist and lyrist, who wielded [[The Stringless]]. He hailed from [[Fontaine]] and left his home country in search of his true fate. He was the second member of the Troupe, having met the conductor by chance. He fell in love with a Mondstadt girl, only for her to be chosen as the Ludi Harpastum princess &mdash; which meant she would be claimed by a member of the Lawrence Clan. In the attempted rebellion, he lost his life to protect his allies.<ref name="Stringless"/><ref name="ROS"/>
** The [[Dawnlight Swordswoman]], also known as the sword dancer, wielded [[The Flute]] and was the third to join the Troupe.<ref name="ROS" /> She was enslaved after the attempted rebellion and turned into a gladiator, where she ultimately met her end. Even while enslaved, she sang of freedom and openly questioned the aristocracy's reign and the people's acceptance of their rule. Her interactions with [[Ragnvindr]] inspired him to rise up against the aristocracy, and he adopted her epithet in his title, "Dawn Knight."<ref name="The Flute"/><ref name="BOTS2"/>
** [[Kreuzlied]], who abandoned the Lawrence Clan, was the fourth to join the Troupe.<ref name="ROS"/> He wielded [[The Bell]] and is the only known survivor of the Troupe, spared because of his lineage. Despite the Troupe's disbandment, Kreuzleid did not give up resisting the aristocracy; he established an underground organization, which would remain active even 500 years later, and used it to aid Vennessa's rebellion.<ref name="TB"/>
*** 500 years later, it was secretly used by [[Rostam]] to aid the Knights of Favonius from the shadows. It is unknown whether the organization is still active in present day.<ref name="TB"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― After many years of loyally fighting under his master Eberhart, the Gladiator who wielded the [[Deathmatch]] (and who the [[Gladiator's Finale]] set belongs to) meets his end at Vennessa's hands. Despite fighting many bloody battles for Eberhart's and his own glory, even after he had already won his freedom &mdash; having been manipulated by Eberhart into continuing &mdash; the Gladiator finds that Eberhart had already left the scene for reasons unknown.<ref name="Gladiator's Finale"/><ref name="DM"/>
** '''~1000 years ago, after the Gladiator's death'''<ref name="AIJ2"/> ― Landrich organizes an aristocracy-led expedition to Sal Vindagnyr, hoping that the expedition will be a great success and their achievements will quell those hoping to rebel against the aristocracy. The expedition party included Ingbert, Eberhart, [[Luther]], [[Nick]], and several other promising young aristocrats. However, the expedition party never returned, so documentation on the event is sparse.<ref name="LandEntombed"/>
** Sometime after arriving at the mountain, the team gets caught in a snowstorm and the unnamed members get separated from the others, who meet up at the South Base Camp. Eberhart convinces the others that the unnamed members should be able to find their way back to the camp, and additionally persuades them to investigate a [[Mural Room|secret room]] that supposedly contains frescoes and weapons forged from [[starsilver]].<ref name="AIJ1"/>
** Not only are they unable to open the locked door of the secret room, but a cave-in kills Nick, burying his supplies with him. Returning to the South Base Camp, they notice the unnamed members have still not returned and Luther hopes they made it back down the mountain to get help. They decide to return to the original plan of exploring the cellar in the southwestern ruins once the storm dies down a bit.<ref name="AIJ2"/>
** Eberhart leads Ingbert and Luther into the cellar and then takes out a polearm, striking Ingbert first and trying to kill them both. While he gravely injures both, Ingbert uses his Vision to launch a counterattack,<ref name="Ragged Records"/> forcing him to retreat heavily injured. While bleeding out in the cellar, Luther realizes Eberhart's large-scale scheme, writing down an apology to [[Priscilla]] before leaving a message for whoever reads the journal to warn Landrich.<ref name="AIJ3"/>
** After leaving the cellar, Eberhart takes refuge in an area where a prison used to be and plans to follow the waterway to where his supplies are hidden. Either at the prison or between there and the supplies, Ingbert catches up to him and Eberhart manages to kill him. Eberhart then heads east to reach the sea and finds his boat and more supplies untouched. He then leaves for Mondstadt with the knowledge that if news reaches the city, Priscilla &mdash; who unbeknownst to Luther, was one of Eberhart's co-conspirators &mdash; will warn him by lighting a torch at [[Stormbearer Point]].<ref name="Ragged Records"/> However, there are no records of Eberhart's return, leaving his ultimate fate a mystery.<ref name="LandEntombed"/>
*** Eberhart's boat never reaches the shore and the waiting Priscilla gets caught by the nobles after the plot is revealed.<ref name="Missive Windspear"/>

===Mondstadt Reborn===
''1000–500 years ago''

* '''1000 years ago, after Ludi Harpastum'''<ref group="Assumption" name="Vennessa's rebellion"/> ― The prayers and cries of the oppressed awakens [[Barbatos]] from his slumber, and he descends on Mondstadt under the guise of [[Venti]]. He befriends [[Vennessa]] after she raised the ire of [[Barca Lawrence]], the heir to the Lawrence Clan, and was sentenced to undergo a series of gladiator matches to win her and her people's freedom. Her last battle is against Ursa the Drake itself, as Lord Lawrence had bartered with the evil dragon to give Mondstadt peace with her and her tribe as an offering. At this moment, Barbatos descends on the battlefield and reveals his true form, giving Vennessa the power to prevail against Ursa and freeing the people from the aristocracy's villainy.<ref name="MNG - P"/><ref name="LOV2"/>
** The above is the official history recorded by Mondstadt's historians. However, this was the beginning of a longer rebellion, during which Barbatos forged a contract between the aristocracy and [[Morax]], claiming that the aristocrats had sold all of Mondstadt to the Geo Archon &mdash; including their own troops. After it was discovered, this "treachery against the wind" caused the troops to rally against the aristocracy, hastening its end. Only many years later did scholars discover that this treaty was fake.<ref name="Venti Bonus"/>
** [[Ragnvindr]]<ref name="FCX"/> and [[Kreuzlied]]<ref name="TB"/> are among those who assisted Vennessa's rebellion, as were adherents to the [[Church of Favonius]] mobilized by the Nameless Shepherd.<ref name="Soyears ago"/> It is unclear whether the rebellion [[Eberhart]] intended to assist when he sabotaged the Dragonspine expedition was Vennessa's, or if it was a different one that was being plotted around the same time.
* After Vennessa's rebellion succeeded, most of the aristocracy and those who had collaborated with them, such as the royal mages, are exiled from Mondstadt.<ref name="Royal Bow"/> Those who proved themselves uncorrupted, such as the [[Gunnhildr Clan]], were allowed to remain.<ref name="BOG"/>
** Vennessa establishes the [[Knights of Favonius]], with herself as its first Dandelion Knight and Grand Master, and restores the Church of Favonius to prevent tyrants from taking over Mondstadt again.<ref name="AquFav"/><ref name="Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds"/><ref name="4WIND"/>
*** After the Knights of Favonius was established, a certain Knight of Boreas arrives at Mondstadt and joins them.<ref name="BAF2"/> However, the wolf companion he originally journeyed with chose not to follow him into the city, preferring the wilderness. The two continued to fight together whenever the Knight left the city to hunt or do battle. When the wolf dies of old age, the Knight buries it in the remote countryside and leaves the Knights of Favonius to become a wanderer.<ref name="WGS"/>
** Ragnvindr converts the aristocrats' indoor bathhouse into the original [[Mondstadt Library]]. It would eventually become the largest library in all of northern Teyvat, up until the Great Fire of Fall Equinox reduced it to one-sixth of its original size.<ref name="FCX"/>
*** The Barbatos Statue, which was originally erected by [[Venerare]] but taken down by the late aristocracy, is also restored, though the original inscription on it has been lost.<ref name="RoyalGrim"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― The [[Four Winds]] are established, with [[Boreas]] as Wolf of the North and [[Dvalin]] as Dragon of the East. Vennessa was simultaneously the Lion of the South (as the first Dandelion Knight) and Falcon of the West.<ref name="4WIND"/><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Falcon of the West"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― Vennessa is chosen by the gods and ascends to [[Celestia]] at [[Windrise]]. A massive oak tree grows where she stood when she ascended.<ref name="Venti Bonus"/><ref name="Jean 4"/>
** This tree has a mysterious connection to Celestia; Venti channels power from it to purify himself from the Abyss' influence,<ref name="Let the Wind Lead (Quest)"/> as well as to heal his body after getting his Gnosis forcefully taken by [[Signora]].<ref name="Ending Note"/>
* '''? years ago''' ― The Great Fire of Fall Equinox reduces the Mondstadt Library to one-sixth of its former size. However, the contents within the library's restricted section, located behind the poplar doors in the library basement, were left untouched.<ref name="FCX"/>
*'''? years ago''' ― Boreas and his wolf pack did not originally live in [[Wolvendom]], but moved there at an unknown point in time.<ref name="ADT"/> It is unclear whether the [[Temple of the Wolf]], located near the [[Thousand Winds Temple]], formerly housed Boreas' spirit.

==Pre-Cataclysm==
<noinclude>''>500 years ago''</noinclude>

* '''>500 years ago''' ― [[Arundolyn]], [[Rostam]], and [[Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter]] are born.
* '''>500 years ago''' ― Arundolyn and his childhood friend Rostam grow up together in Mondstadt and eventually both join the Knights of Favonius. Arundolyn becomes the Grand Master known as the "Lion of Light," while Rostam becomes the "Wolf Pup."<ref name="FGS"/><ref name="BH"/><ref name="FS"/>
** Rostam gained the title of Wolf Pup when he was 27 years old.<ref name="FSWD"/> He preferred doing dirty work in the shadows, without restraints of being a knight, so that Arundolyn could remain a model knight.<ref name="Defender's Will"/> It is said that he continued running the secret society established around 500 years earlier by [[Kreuzlied]].<ref name="TB"/>
** Rostam taught the Knights of Favonius his sword style, the [[Favonius Bladework]], which continues to be used to this day.<ref name="FSWD"/><ref name="Defender's Will" /> Arundolyn's fighting style, which wielded a greatsword in one hand and a longsword in the other, required immense strength that few were able to replicate, and so it soon died out.<ref name="FGS"/>
* '''>500 years ago''' ― Rostam and Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter fall in love.
* '''>500 years ago, just before the cataclysm''' ― Rosalyne leaves Mondstadt to study at [[Sumeru Akademiya]].

** Rostam mentors a man known as the White Knight (possibly "Roland"<ref name="Elegy for the End"/> who loved justice above all else and fought against the monsters of Khaenri'ah.<ref name="Defender's Will"/><ref name="TBS"/><ref name="BSC"/> As he fought monsters, he came to be known as the Bloodstained Knight, and people started fearing him.<ref name="BSC"/> He then ventures deeper into Khaenri'ah and dies battling monsters. In the depths of the world, he learns about the origin of the monsters that destroyed Khaenri'ah and the ultimate injustice that turned the people of Khaenri'ah into monsters, therefore joining the [[Abyss Order]].<ref name="BSC"/>
* An alchemist from Khaenri'ah, "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]], creates one of her masterpieces, [[Durin]].<ref name="chalk-prince-afterword"/><ref name="SWS"/><ref name="Snowy"/> She sends Durin and other creatures she created to the continent of Teyvat to "display [their] beauty."<ref name="FstDsr"/> Upon reaching Mondstadt, however, Durin lays waste to the city,<ref name="BAF2"/><ref name="SWS"/><ref name="Chunk of Aerosiderite"/><ref name="SWB"/><ref name="SWP"/> although it is suggested that Durin was not conscious of his actions after reaching Teyvat until Dvalin fatally wounded him in their battle.<ref name="DgspSpr"/>
* At that time there was no Lionfang Knight, as Arundolyn, then Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius and Lion of the South, gave up fighting after his friend Rostam died during the expedition to Khaenri'ah.<ref name="BAF2" /><ref name="FGS"/><ref name="BH"/><ref name="FS"/><ref name="FSWD"/><ref name="Defender's Will"/> As a result, there was also no one strong enough to take on Durin.<ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Rostam"/><ref group="Translation Note" name="Difficult time for Mondstadt"/>
* The people's cry for help are heard by the Anemo Archon, who calls upon Dvalin. The two engage Durin in battle and eventually defeat him, but Dvalin ingests Durin's poisonous blood, corrupted by the Abyss' power, in the process. To recuperate, Dvalin takes refuge in Decarabian's Tower in Old Mondstadt and falls into deep slumber.<ref name="BAF2"/><ref name="SWS"/><ref name="SWB"/><ref name="SWP"/><ref name="Dvalin's Claw"/>
** Durin's corpse falls over on Dragonspine and the power inside Durin's blood seeps into the land, reviving the [[Frostbearing Tree]]. Durin's blood appears to coagulate as [[Scarlet Quartz]], due to the high concentrations of the mineral in [[Wyrmrest Valley]], wherein Durin's heart still beats.<ref name="DgspSpr"/>
* [[Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter]] returns to Mondstadt and learns of Rostam's death. In her rage and despair, she uses the art of liquid flame she learned at [[Sumeru Akademiya]] to turn her body into that of living flame to avenge him, and becomes known the Crimson Witch of Flames.<ref name="Crimson Witch of Flames"/><ref group="Assumption" name="Rosalyne"/>

** After Varka's departure, Diluc returns to Mondstadt, taking over as head of the Dawn Winery that he had entrusted to [[Adelinde]] and [[Elzer]] and taking up his Vision once more.

Unbeknownst to most people, this hero is Diluc himself.<ref name="Diluc 5" />
* A thief steals an artifact from a certain eastern temple in Mondstadt, a vial supposedly containing Barbatos' breath. After word got out, counterfeits have flooded the black market and since then, Diluc and the Fatui have been in a purchasing war in their attempts to each secure the genuine artifact.<ref name="State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel"/>
* '''Last Ludi Harpastum (~1 year to 6 months ago)'''<ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Crepus discrepancy"/> ― The events of the manga's main story occur.
** The Fatui, led by [[Il Dottore]], attempt to take of Ludi Harpastum to recruit more test subjects, but are thwarted in their initial attempt by Diluc and Kaeya's plan, and Dottore loses interest in the city. As some Fatui diplomats are about to leave on Dottore's orders, they run afoul of [[Collei]], who needed a distraction to slip into the city. She uses the power of her Archon Residue to create a serpent of black fire that kills the diplomats, and the Knights of Favonius are obligated to investigate the situation to maintain relations with the Fatui.
**Collei, seeking information about Barnabas to exact her revenge, runs into Amber, then Jean and Lisa. They give her permission to enter the library as they continue investigating the Black Fire Incident, and discover that the power that slew the diplomats is similar in nature to the Delusion (Evil Eye) used by Crepus several years earlier. Amber, who had encountered Dottore as he departed from Mondstadt, grows suspicious after noticing that both he and the Delusion smelled of Mist Pollen. She decides to try and track him down, and manages to find a Fatui device inside a hilichurl camp. However, she is then attacked by [[Krupp]], a former Fatui researcher whom Dottore transformed into a Ruin Hunter. Together with Jean, who went to reinforce her, they take down Krupp for good and return to Mondstadt with evidence against the Fatui.
** Realizing that the Fatui are hoping to instigate a swarm of monster attacks during the festival so they can take the credit for defeating them and saving Mondstadt, the Knights of Favonius decide to track down the Fatui devices and destroy them. In the meantime, Lisa contacts her teacher at Sumeru Akademiya to see if anyone would be able to seal Collei's Archon Residue. Amber takes advantage of the situation to let Collei experience Ludi Harpastum's festivities, but their fun is interrupted by Kaeya, who lures Collei away and attacks her to draw out her powers, confirming that she was behind the Black Fire Incident.<ref name="CHAP10"/> Upon realizing that Collei herself is innocent, and Amber's interruption allowing her to get away, Kaeya decides to enlist Diluc's help in creating an alibi for the girl.
** Barnabas, who came to deal with the Black Fire Incident in Dottore's stead, confronts Kaeya about Collei, having witnessed Amber help her escape. Kaeya pretends to help, with Diluc posing as the perpetrator behind the incident to Barnabas' guards. However, Barnabas himself notices the archon power emitted when [[Cyno]] &mdash; who was sent from Sumeru Akademiya in response to Lisa's message &mdash; seals away Collei's Archon Residue. He confronts and attacks Collei and Amber after Cyno leaves to report to Lisa, but is eventually thwarted by Amber and Diluc's efforts.<ref name="CHAP15"/>
** Kaeya "traps" Diluc after Barnabas' defeat, allowing the Fatui guards to arrest him and take him away, thereby absolving the Knights of Favonius from any responsibility. Shortly thereafter, Diluc breaks out, leaving behind his mask and Delusion for an uninterested Dottore. The Harbinger also grows irritated by Barnabas' failure and has his guards get rid of him.<ref name="CHAP16"/>
*** In the manga, Kaeya returns Diluc's Vision after he breaks out of prison, hiding it inside the Strange Vase that can be seen inside the Dawn Winery in-game.<ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Strange Vase"/>
* The Traveler wakes up after being attacked by the Unknown God, finding the current state of Teyvat unfamiliar. They continue wandering alone for some time until they meet Paimon.<ref name="TravelerCS2"/>
* '''2 months ago''' &mdash; The Traveler meets Paimon after saving her from drowning by fishing her out.<ref name="AQ0-0"/> After teaching the Traveler the common Teyvat language, she suggests that they look for the Seven Archons to see if they have clues about their sibling's whereabouts.

<!--Mainpage notes-->
--><ref group="Note" name="Archon War start">Occurred at some point before the destruction of Guili Assembly 3700 years.</ref><!--
<!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Celestial Nails">All Celestial Nails are implied to have been cast down simultaneously after the Heavenly Principles won the great war of vengeance. Therefore, this takes place at the same time as the creation of [[The Chasm]], which happened 6000 years ago.</ref><!--

<!--Mondstadt notes-->
--><ref group="Note" name="Snow and strife">While snow and strife could be the interpretation and the result of the war between [[Decarabian]] and [[Boreas]] in the Archon War, the existence of the Celestial Nail meant that snow and strife were the results of the great war of vengeance.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Decarabian style">Ruins containing the ornamentation style found primarily in Stormterror's Lair can be seen across Brightcrown Mountains and Windwail Highland. It is unique from other ruins' ornamentation styles, making it easy to connect them.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="War start date ">The [[Biography of Gunnhildr]] gives the earliest known date for Boreas and Decarabian's war at 3000 years ago. However, this only records the start of the Gunnhildr Clan's story, so it may have begun well beforehand, while Venti's character stories give a more precise date for the fall of Old Mondstadt at 2600 years ago.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="First Field Tiller">It is unclear whether the first Field Tiller came to Mondstadt before or after the cataclysm. Barbara's story only vaguely frames the story between Decarabian's death and before the present day, and Boreas' account of his fight against the Field Tiller places it after he moved to [[Wolvendom]] &mdash; except there is no timeframe for that either. Note that [[Guizhong]], who lived far before Decarabian fell, had access to Ruin Guards and Ruin Hunters, so it is possible that the first Field Tiller wandered into Mondstadt before the cataclysm and not after it, like most other Ruin Guards.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Defiled Statue">Since the Loom of Fate operation is still in its early stages in Present Day, the Defiled Statue was likely stolen somewhat recently. However, it was stolen long enough ago that Barbara says that it's an "old story" and happened "a long time ago."</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Kaeya's story"">It is currently unknown exactly when Kaeya told his story that happened "a decade ago" to the Grand Master.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Crepus death">In the flashback, the pacing suggests that the battle with Ursa ends, Crepus collapses, Kaeya and other knights arrive at the scene, and Crepus dies in Diluc's arm's all in very short order, with no suggested timelapses. However, when Crepus dies in Diluc's arms, there is blood on Diluc's face that was not there when Crepus collapsed after the battle ended.</ref><!--

===Lore Discrepancies===
{{Reflist|group=Lore Discrepancy|refs=<!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Rebellion knight">In [[Amos' Bow]]'s description and the ''The Boy and the Whirlwind'' trailer, both from the Closed Beta Test era, there were four leaders of the rebellion: the Nameless Bard, the elf/wind spirit, Amos, and the knight. Based on process of elimination, the red-haired man in the trailer was the knight. Much later, in [[Version 1.6]], [[Freedom-Sworn]] named the Red-Haired Warrior as a fifth leader and thus left the identity of the knight a mystery. Based on process of elimination again, the knight would probably be Gunnhildr, whose involvement in the rebellion was otherwise only attested to in [[Biography of Gunnhildr]].</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Falcon of the West">The manga suggests that Vennessa became Falcon of the West after her ascension, but Venti's Character Tale depicts her as a mortal after the establishment of the Four Winds, which indicates that she was both while she was alive.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Rostam">[[Breeze Amidst the Forest#Vol. 2|Breeze Amidst the Forest]] appears to place Rostam's death (indicated by "The Lionfang Knight was without a suitable heir") before Barbatos and Dvalin began to fight Durin. However, [[Elegy for the End]] says that Rostam fought at the same time as Barbatos, Dvalin, and Durin and that Rostam died at around the same time Durin did.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Outrider">Amber's Character Story 3 and Vision Story conflict on whether she joined the Outriders before or after her grandfather's disappearance.<br>One possible resolution of this discrepancy is that trainee Outriders are not considered Outriders proper until they're no longer trainees, as Amber's Vision Story specifies that she officially became an Outrider after her grandfather's death while her Character Story 3 only says that she was admitted to the Outriders before her grandfather's death without specifying if being admitted to the Outriders means officially becoming an Outrider or if it can also mean being admitted as a trainee.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Crepus discrepancy">Crepus' death occurs 3 years before the manga's events while Diluc's character stories place it 4 years before the game's story, making the manga set roughly a year before the game. However, according to Diluc's stories, he returned to Mondstadt after Varka left on his expedition, making his return occur sometime within 6 months before the game's story. The message on the [[Cat's Tail Message Board#About Collei...|Cat's Tail Message Board]] about Collei says she was seen at the "last Ludi Harpastum" before the game's story, with no indication of how long ago it occurred.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Strange Vase">The Strange Vase exists in-game and is also referred to in [[A Child's Secret]]. However, the events of the manga happen in at least three days, which means that Diluc &mdash; who hosted a large party at the beginning of the manga with esteemed guests such as [[Seamus Pegg]] &mdash; had already been back in Mondstadt for at least three days by the time he received his Vision in the vase, conflicting with his [[Diluc/Lore#Vision|Vision story]], which says that he took up his Vision the same day he returned to Mondstadt.</ref><!--
-->}}

===Translation Notes===
{{Reflist|group=Translation Note|refs=<!--
--><ref group="Translation Note" name="Blizzard">The original Chinese version of "This land was once a realm of sub-zero blizzards and ice storms filled with razor-sharp ice shards, all at the command of Boreas" uses a more passive tone which suggests that Boreas did not actively will it, but rather caused it simply by existing.<br>Chinese text: {{zh|这片大地上曾经北风呼啸，呼气凝霜。|tl=Long ago did the North Wind howl on this land, his breath congealing into frost.}}</ref><!--
--><ref group="Translation Note" name="Difficult time for Mondstadt">In [[Breeze Amidst the Forest#Vol. 2|Breeze Amidst the Forest]], the English translation treats the paragraph beginning with "It was an especially difficult time for Mondstadt." as a cause and the paragraph beginning with "The prayers of Mondstadt's people awoke the Anemo Archon" as the effect. However, the original Chinese text treats them more like two descriptions of events that happened in the same timeframe instead of cause and effect.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Translation Note" name="Jacob Musk">The original Chinese text attributes "An Investigation into the Cultural Customs of the Wind Kingdom" to an unspecified [[Musk Family]] member; Jacob Musk is not specified like he is in English.</ref><!--
-->}}

===Editors' Assumptions===
{{Reflist|group=Assumption|refs=<!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Kings of Ice and Frost">According to Fragment of Decarabian's Epic, Boreas declared war on Decarabian but was unable to break through Decarabian's storm wall. However, there is currently no in-game reference to Decarabian's response towards Boreas. It can be assumed that Decarabian either had no interest in fighting Boreas or was equally incapable of overcoming the other god. Boreas eventually chose to die of his own volition while Decarabian was slain by humans and the wind spirit, leaving their conflict a draw.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Wind spirit">The wind spirit who saved Gunnhildr's Clan is not explicitly stated to be Barbatos. At the same time, there is no evidence that suggests they worshipped another wind spirit, and there is too little information about Istaroth to draw any conclusions about them.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Leonard">Assuming Barbatos terraformed Mondstadt shortly after his ascension, Leonard's attempt to scale Pilos Peak must have come before 2600 years ago, even though Mona rounds his time period down to 2000 years ago. He also mentions [[Venerare]], the leader of the [[Lawrence Clan]] at the start of Barbatos' Mondstadt, which means he had to have lived around the end of Decarabian's Mondstadt.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Boreas death">It is unknown when Boreas died. The land outside of Decarabian's Mondstadt was a snowy wasteland, which would indicate that Boreas had not yet let his powers flow into the land to nourish it, but Barbatos became Anemo Archon shortly after Decarabian fell, which suggests that Boreas had already chosen to remove himself from the Archon War via death by the time Barbatos rose.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Hexenzirkel">Based on the frequency of Barbatos's descent and the Hexenzirkel's possible time frame, the event has been tentatively put here without clear evidence. One of Alice's titles, "Defender of Old Mondstadt," might have been coined during this event.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Ingbert">Ingbert is never specified to be an allogene. However, [[Ragged Records]] refers to someone as one of "the chosen"; this must be Ingbert, based on [[Ancient Investigation Journal: Part III]]. So far, those who are referred to as "chosen" are largely, if not exclusively, Vision bearers.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Wanderer's Troupe disbanding">No dates have been specified for the Wanderer's Troupe's active period, but it disbanded a few years before Vennessa's rebellion at most. Ragnvindr and Kreuzleid were both around for the fall of the Troupe and would later assist Vennessa's rebellion.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Vennessa's rebellion">It is unclear when Vennessa's rebellion occurred relative to the failed Dragonspine expedition, but it likely came afterwards or coincided with it at earliest. Vennessa offends Barca on the last day of Ludi Harpastum, after which she was purchased by Lord Lawrence and sentenced to do battle in the arena to win her freedom, but we don't know how long those battles took.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Rosalyne">As Rosalyne set out to burn demons and monsters, the cataclysm may have still been ongoing when she became the Crimson Witch of Flame.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Crimson Witch">The lands that the Crimson Witch of Flame burned are unspecified, but as Rosalyne lived in Mondstadt and learned of Rostam's death upon her return to Mondstadt, it is assumed that Pierro found the Crimson Witch of Flame in Mondstadt. The exact time he found her is also unknown, but since the Tsaritsa sent Pierro to recruit for the Fatui in response to the cataclysm and the Crimson Witch of Flame was being burned alive by the very flames she turned herself into, Pierro must have found the Crimson Witch of Flame shortly after the cataclysm.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Eroch">In the manga, Amber mentions that she overheard the argument between Eroch and Diluc while hiding in a cupboard to prank her grandfather, indicating that he hadn't resigned at the time of Crepus' death.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Albedo joining the Knights">It is unclear when exactly Albedo joined the Knights of Favonius, but between Albedo's [[Albedo/Lore#Character Story 2|second character story]] and Klee's [[Klee/Lore#Character Story 1|first character story]], it appears they came to Mondstadt around the same time.</ref><!--
