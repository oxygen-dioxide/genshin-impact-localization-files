==Profile==
Gohar is a well-known and popular individual at Caravan Ribat. Safie describes her as "a beautiful lady that everyone here in Caravan Ribat likes."

Some weeks before the [[Traveler]] visits Caravan Ribat, Gohar received a letter via [[Dusk Bird]] to meet someone &mdash; ostensibly her lover<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Hawad}}</ref> &mdash; in [[Sumeru City]]. She immediately departed for the city and was escorted by the [[Eremite]] mercenary [[Safie]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Safie}}</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Vikram]] sent [[Baharak]] to pass on an identical message to Gohar; by the time Baharak arrived, she learned that Gohar had received the message and was no longer in Caravan Ribat, leaving her to wonder whether she had made a mistake somewhere.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Baharak}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* According to a message on the [[Akademiya Public Message Board]],<ref>{{Ref/BB|Akademiya Public Message Board|About Rifaet and Vikram}}</ref> Vikram is married, and [[Hawad]] says that she traveled to Sumeru City to find her lover. This makes it possible that Vikram and Gohar are lovers, although this cannot be confirmed based on current information.
