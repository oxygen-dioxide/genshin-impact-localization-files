[[Version 0.7.1]]
* The quest's story was changed to accommodate the Fatui now stealing the Holy Lyre at the end of ''Venti's New Plan'':
** {{Color|Old:}} Jean tells the Traveler that they have two of the three signatures needed to borrow the Holy Lyre, so she and the Traveler go to meet with Barbara to obtain the third signature.
** {{Color|New:}} Jean and Diluc tell the Traveler where the Fatui have likely hidden the Holy Lyre, so Diluc and the Traveler go to retrieve it.

[[Version 0.0.1]]
