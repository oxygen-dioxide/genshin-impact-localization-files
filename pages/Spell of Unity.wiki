** Additionally, during steps 5-6, a trial Citlali joins the active party.<!-- Is this the first time there have ever been 5 trial characters in one party? -->
** Leaving the Special Story Mode will reset the quest to Step 3, and all progress will be lost.
* All characters' [[energy]] and [[HP]] will be restored to full when the fight at the Children of Echoes base begins, after its flag is switched, after the flag at the People of the Springs base is switched, and when the fight at the Scions of the Canopy base begins.

:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah... I blame Kachina, being all mysterious about some gathering to discuss "something important." I was so curious, I couldn't stop tossing and turning the whole night!
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Also, how come it's so quiet today? You didn't lock Ajaw up, did you?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' When I tried to wake him up this morning, his response was: "Leave me be, minion! Dar'st thou disturb the Almighty Dragonlord in our slumber?" I figured it would be for the best that he's not here anyway, so I didn't bother calling him again.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Haha, good thing you didn't tell him about our gathering. We could do without his gate-crashing, for sure...

:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 02.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' It's... a long story. One that begins with a "mysterious friend" of Milray's...
:{{Black Screen|Ifa relates what happened in the Bloomflower Trials centuries ago, and the tale of the little Qucusaur, Antu.}}
:{{Black Screen|After hearing such a tragic tale, everyone seems a bit gloomy.}}
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Bloodshed between the tribes... That seems almost unthinkable today, but it was an everyday occurrence in that era.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Even working together on something was impossible... That's just too awful!
:{{Introductory Note|Varesa}}
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' There have always been disputes, but once they escalated into fully-fledged clashes between tribes... Even a peacemaker would have been powerless to mediate.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' And that little Qucusaur, Antu, believed that the Sacred Flame Crystals harbored some kind of evil power that lay at the root of these inter-tribal conflicts.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' And that led to all the later misunderstandings. At this point, it would be nigh impossible to explain the truth to him... Granny's right, it would only make him suffer all over again.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That said, Antu will naturally sense that something's off once we've collected enough Sacred Flame Crystals and cure Milray, won't he?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' He'll see that no one has been "corrupted" and that all is as it should be. At that point, he would realize the truth of what happened in the past, even as young as he is.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 03.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Exactly. That's why we came up with a plan.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 04.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' When the second half of the tournament wraps up, we'll have enough Sacred Flame Crystals. That's when I want everyone to act like the Crystals have messed with us and start arguing.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Ooh, acting! That sounds fun. Then what?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 05.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Then, we'll bring Antu over and cast a "Spell of Unity" to cleanse all the bad vibes within the Sacred Flame Crystals and bring everyone back to their senses.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 06.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Of course, neither the evil power or the magic are real, but we've gotta make the lil' dude think he's done "something awesome."
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Aha, yeah. I get where you're going with this.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The best way to make up for regrets is to do what you failed to do before. We'll recreate that scene from his past, only this time, he'll get the chance to rewrite the future.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So, how exactly are we going to do this? Is there anything we can look to?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Once, when I was reading a foreign book, I came across something called an "interactive play," designed specifically for kids.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The story usually features a showdown between a hero and a villain, with twists and turns throughout. Just as things reach a climax, the hero will pretend to be losing and ask for the children's help.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Then, the children all raise their hands, lending their power to the hero and helping them defeat the villain.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' For the adults watching, it's just a performance, but the children will walk away feeling happy for days to come.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' At that age, happiness doesn't come from material rewards, but from "a heart that believes."
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' True! I can totally relate.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' When I helped out at my parents' shop as a kid, they would always intentionally leave me some simple tasks, like dusting down the shelves or making sure the merchandise was arranged neatly.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Then they'd shower me with praise when I was finished, saying stuff like, "Good job, Mualani, you're a genius!"... And the funny thing is, it always made me super happy!
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 07.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Spot on, that's exactly it. We wanna make Antu feel the same way a kid who just helped a hero would, lessen his regret and pain... before he moves on.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 08.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Besides, Milray already heard the rumors about the Sacred Flame Crystals from him. If we don't dispel the "curse" right in front of him, he might refuse to take the medicine.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 09.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' But we can't pull off a show like that with just us. That's why I'm asking for your help.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' We'll probably need about five more people... *ahem* I mean, there are five more spots up for grabs. First come, first served!
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You have my board! Hehe, I'm probably the best at arguing here, don'cha think?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We get some pretty rude customers in our shop, and I've had to develop quite a few communication skills to deal with them.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You have my... cabbages? I can help prepare some props and special effects, like smoke to mimic the "evil power" and bright lights for the "Spell of Unity."
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And my Flamestrider.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, you're joining too, Archon?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It really resonated with me when Citlali mentioned a clash between heroes and villains.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And unlike the heroes in those plays, I've borrowed strength from all of you in the real world &mdash; and we've overcome powerful foes together as a result. I think I'll do justice to the role.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' If Mavuika's on board, then you have my hammer. I'm really interested in the part where we "pretend to argue."
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 ifa 10.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Let's see. We've got our actors, and the stage is set. Now, we need a... director. A dude to run the show.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Wh&mdash;What's wrong? Why are you all looking at me?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Consider it our vote of confidence, Kinich!
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Fine. Then you have my grappling hook. I happen to have some time.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' So that's everyone, then? In that case, Varesa and I will take care of the cleanup.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Sorry, guys. I'd love to sign up, but I already promised to help transport the wounded.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' As for me... Ugh, if I see you all arguing, I wouldn't be able to resist stepping in.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' And I'm just really bad at acting. I'd be so stiff, the game would be up before we even got started.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I'll stay and help the saurians search for Ocean Zephyrs. Once they've brought enough back, I'll join you as soon as I can.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' As our Archon herself often says, "we all have our own part to play"... Right?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right. Alright, once the second half of the exhibition match is over, we'll split into two teams and play our respective "parts."
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Great! Let's make the second half an even more exciting fight. That way, we'll be able to collect more Sacred Flame Crystals to help cure Milray.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I've even come up with a "secret strategy" that's sure to catch you all off guard!
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' After centuries, we're holding the Bloomflower Trials once more. I hope that this time, we can bring them to a close free from regret.
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Are you all confident that we can do this?
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 together 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' Yeah!!!
:{{A|vo nteq003 1 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Then let's get this show on the road!
:;(The competition begins)<!-- black screen transition, enter domain -->
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, looks like everyone's here. Time for a strategy meeting!
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, why do they keep picking battlefields covered in mountains that need climbing...
:{{DIcon}} ...But you can fly, Paimon.
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' If you're worried about getting tired, I can just fly you straight to the top.
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Launching a surprise attack on their base would also be a good tactic.
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I'll use smoke to sow confusion amongst their ranks, then you guys can just charge in and beat the living daylights out of them.
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It'll be over as soon as it began.
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *ahem* These two are in even more of a rush than Paimon is...
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Let's all just calm down for a moment. We don't even know what their formation will be like. Besides, if we don't deal with nearby opponents first, our main base could be at risk.
:{{DIcon}} Slow and steady wins the race.
:{{DIcon}} Let's start with the base at the foot of the mountain.
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the area nearby is full of rocks... Looks like they're trying to block our path.
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Pff, that's nothing. Let's just charge straight through.
:{{A|vo nteq003 2 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' C'mon, time for a warm-up!

;(Destroy the Pulverite rocks)
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you actually managed to smash all the rocks...
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Whew, that loosened me up.

;(Approach Kachina)
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I&mdash;I'll stop you in your tracks!

;(After defeating the first wave of enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Don't worry, everyone, we can do it!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Ugh, we've got to fall back for now...

;(Change the flag)
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Excellent, we've secured the Children of Echoes' base. Time to head up the mountain.
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' All tuckered out? Let me give you a hand.
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Granny to the rescue! Now that's what Paimon calls some serious backup!
:{{A|vo nteq003 3 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Uhh... Granny's... not here to check if I've been slacking, is she...?

;(Approach the People of the Springs' base)
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 nalani 01.ogg}} '''Nalani:''' Find a way to hold them off!

;(Change the flag)
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Nice, another one in the bag.
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Something's wrong... There are far fewer people in their base than expected.
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' And Mualani hasn't put in an appearance yet either...
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 sanora 01.ogg}} '''Sanora:''' Uh oh, not good! The People of the Springs took back the base we just captured.
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 sanora 02.ogg}} '''Sanora:''' And even worse, they're sending troops to attack our main base...
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hah. That girl has some moves, I'll give her that...
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Looks like we'll have to split our forces to hold off their counterattack.
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Don't worry, I'll handle Mualani. She still owes me for wrecking my front door. You just focus on moving forward.
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You're a lifesaver, Granny Citlali. We can rest easy knowing you're here covering the rear.
:{{A|vo nteq003 4 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Thanks, Granny. We've got this.

;(Head towards the first base)
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Citlali's taking care of things over there... Let's head to their next base!

;(Head towards the third base)
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How is this not over yet? How many people do they have in reserve...?
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Splitting their forces into smaller squads to slow our advance and undermine our morale... Very clever.

;(Approach the cliffside)
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Looks like the Scions of the Canopy's base is on the other side of that cliff.
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oooh, does that mean it's finally time for the big showdown?
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' That clifftop's very high up... Whatever you do while you're flying over, don't look down.

;(Approach Kinich)
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I knew that wouldn't stop you. Let's have our weapons do the talking.

;(After defeating the first wave of enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' This isn't over yet.

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo nteq003 5 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' This fight is done. Sound the retreat.

;(Change the flag)
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' The fruits of victory taste almost as sweet as ones I've grown myself... At least I won't be in for one of Granny's scoldings.
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well that explains why you were so fired up today...
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ororon... Since when has your Granny ever gone around scolding people like some sort of scary monster, huh? Huh!?
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' ...
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Ahem, anyway... Good workout, huh?
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You can say that again. It's not every day you get to enjoy the thrill of battle.
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You youngsters sure love a good brawl, huh?
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Once this is all over, I think I'll need a few days at home to lie down and recover...
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Thanks, Granny. Without your support, who knows what might have happened.
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hmph, I'll have you know that Mualani didn't pull any punches during our little skirmish just now.
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Next time she shows up at my place asking for a favor, I'm giving her a proper talking-to...
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, shows that everyone really was giving it their all.
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, after all that, surely we've collected enough Sacred Flame Crystals now?
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' We have indeed. Let's gather them up and head back.
:{{A|vo nteq003 6 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Next up, time for our little "play."
:;(The group reconvenes)<!-- black screen transition, leave domain -->
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ifa, this should be enough, right?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ifa 01.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Yeah, plenty, maybe more than we can even use.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's great news. Just goes to show how fired up everyone was. Let's set the remainder aside in case of emergency.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Next up, the main event. When do we start?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ifa 02.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Just a sec. Before we roll the kameras, let's break it all down one more time.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ifa 03.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Shortly, you'll all take the Sacred Flame Crystals and place them in front of Milray and Naiyan. Then, once Kinich gives the signal, Ororon will do his thing, and the Crystals will start giving off a black mist.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ifa 04.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' That'll be the cue to start fighting. Once things get real heated, we'll bring Antu in and have him cast the "Spell of Unity."
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ifa 05.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Afterwards, Ororon will clear his black mist, and then we all go back to chillin' with each other. Any questions?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Relax, I've played it all through in my head many times now.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ifa 06.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Great. Then let's do this.
:;(They wait until sunset)
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Phew. Finally, we've got all the Sacred Flame Crystals we need. Don't worry, little guy, you'll be better in no time.
:'''Milray:''' Wroooh...
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 milray 02.ogg}} '''Milray:''' Rawrrrrrr!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It's just like Ifa said &mdash; he looks very reluctant to go through with this...
:'''Naiyan:''' Wrrawr...
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' As long as he sees us "dispel the curse" with his own eyes, we'll be alright... Let's proceed.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Hey, Mualani! Ugh, that's weird, I feel a bit... dizzy...
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' (Special Effects team, get in position.)
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' (On the case.)
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Now, time to get squabbling. As agreed, we'll start with Mualani.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' You've got this, Mualani...!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Leave it to me!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' *ahem* Now listen up, Kachina&mdash;
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I, uhh... I&mdash;I'm gonna give you a piece of my mind, ya hear me? I'd never have thought you'd do something so terrible, Kachina! Why, I'm positively furious!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Eh? Wh&mdash;What did I do again?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That... is a good question! Let me... think about that...
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' ...I thought you said you were a natural at this?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I&mdash;I am! But... I'm struggling to come up with a reason to argue! How am I supposed to tap into old talents when I'm drawing blanks here...
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 milray 03.ogg}} '''Milray:''' Rrrarawwr?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' If this goes on much longer, even the little saurians will realize something's off.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Don't get caught up on the reasons for an argument! Just start by setting the atmosphere for one!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Don't panic, I'm thinking, I'm thinking... I know! How about this...
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Kachina! You stand accused of the heinous crime of eating my very last Saurus Cracker!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Ehhh?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' When we went out for a picnic last night, you ate the last Saurus Cracker! How could you have done such an abominable thing? I was saving that for the end!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' O&mdash;Oh! I'm sorr&mdash; Uh, I mean, so? You ate way more than I did...!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' No, no, no! You just don't get it! The ones we ate in the middle don't matter &mdash; the last one's always the tastiest!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 milray 04.ogg}} '''Milray:''' Wrraawr...?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Good, he's starting to buy it. Time to turn up the heat.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Mualani, isn't it about time you paid up for wrecking my door?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Seriously, you're bringing this up now!? You promised to let it go the last time we had dinner together!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' And when might that have been?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The last time we had dinner, like I said! We were over at the People of the Springs, and you'd had just a teensy bit too much to drink... You took my hand and said it was "all water under the bridge"!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hold on, have you genuinely forgotten? This isn't part of your act, is it? And to think, I tried so hard...
:'''Milray:''' Roarrr!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Is this... what Sacred Flame Crystals can do? It's like you've all become completely different people.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Surely, our only hope now is for me to&mdash;
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Can it, Mavuika! Do you even have any idea how long I've had to put up with your nonsense?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Without so much as a heads up, you just dump some pile of design schematics in my workshop that you'd gotten from who knows where, then tell me to build you that... Flamerider, or whatever you call it!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Then you drive it into the wilderness every single day, then whenever it breaks down, you send it straight back to me for repair &mdash; even when I'm on vacation!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Oh, and not to mention your special sunglasses and that precious sword of yours that's impervious to even the hottest of flames... Do you need me to make a list?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Uhh...
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kachina 06.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Is it just me, or is Xilonen's acting pretty convincing?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' She might be the only one who's not actually acting, Kachina.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' *yawn*... So sleepy. Why didn't you wake me up this morning, Kinich?
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' From now on, I'm not taking any more work during holidays, and you're banned from showing up at my vacation spots.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Wait a minute, I remember now! You were the one who kept encouraging me to drink more that evening!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Trying to get me drunk so you could write off some old debts, huh? Smooth moves, Mualani! Figured out some tricks to use on old Granny, have you?

:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Listen up, everyone! Arguing won't solve any problems, so let's settle this with a good old-fashioned fight to the death! I, the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw, hereby appoint myself your referee!

:{{A|vo nteq003 7 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Perfect timing.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You! Well, you're the worst! You wasted an entire bucket of ice by taking a BATH in it!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kachina 07.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' And you ate all those crackers I baked! I spent the whole night preparing them...
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Always yelling at the top of your lungs &mdash; you're a permanent earache in a pint-sized package!
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' No list would suffice to record the horrible things you've done.
:{{A|vo nteq003 7 ajaw 06.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Whoa, whoa, whoa, time out, time out! Why's this all suddenly aimed at me?

:'''Milray & Naiyan:''' Raaaawr...
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' H&mdash;How could this be? The argument's spiraling out of control! I can no longer cleanse the evil power within the Sacred Flame Crystals myself!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If this goes on much longer... Continues for much longer... Uhh, how does it go again... Let me see...
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh yeah. "If this goes on much longer, Natlan will be in grave danger."
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "We're so close. If only a brave hero would step forward..."

:{{A|vo nteq003 8 shanga 02.ogg}} '''Shanga:''' What right do you Children of Echoes think you have to point fingers at us? How many times have you wronged us over the years?
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 monetech 01.ogg}} '''Monetech:''' Bunch of liars and cowards, banding together like the vermin you are. It's sickening.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 tepanahui 01.ogg}} '''Tepanahui:''' Never have the heavens smiled down upon those who live by the rules. If something's worth having, you've got to take it by force.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 paio 01.ogg}} '''Paio:''' I should never have believed you!
:'''Antu:''' (It's all my fault... If only I'd never fallen ill in the first place...)
:'''Antu:''' (I don't want to be cured, and I don't want the Sacred Flame Crystals. Please stop fighting, please!)

:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 06.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Fly, my dude, fly! Cast the "Spell of Unity," just like I taught you!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 antu 06.ogg}} '''Antu:''' Gruuuu!

:;(A sphere appears around Antu bringing him into the sky)
:;(Light shines down as he flies over the bickering crowd)
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 07.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' "The path of fate lies bleak. Walls rise in human hearts."
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 08.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' "Yet those walls we shall break, and we will march on."
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 09.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' "From this day forth, may worldly strife be no more&mdash;"
:'''Antu:''' Gugugu&mdash;!!!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' What in the... Look, the evil power is fading.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The magic's working.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Grainfruit Chips taste so much better with sweet cheese &mdash; that's not even up for debate!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hmph, I think you'll find that salted cheese is the classic &mdash; the first and best choice in Natlan for centuries.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Pfff, cheese? That stuff's for kids, I'd never go near it!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, I guess you're not completely wrong! They have a unique flavor with salted cheese too &mdash; the perfect storytime snack.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Also great with a glass of wine. Though sweet cheese with a splash of liqueur works well too...
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Let's have another get-together sometime. Don't worry, I won't bring up the door incident again.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You're amazing, Granny! Next time, I'll come with Kachina, and we'll bring some home-baked Saurus Crackers and Grainfruit Chips along...

:{{A|vo nteq003 8 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Sure! In that case, I'll go find Varesa and we'll make you some nice... juice, or something. *sigh* When will you all grow up? Why does it feel like I'm always the only one drinking...
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You should stay off the bottle, too, Granny! Isn't there some kind of sweet and sour soup that's all the rage with the Masters of the Night-Wind right now? What's it called again... Mystique Soup? Much better than alcohol, if you ask me!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Wait a minute, what exactly is going on here? Your attitudes towards each other are changing way too fast!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That's weird... What was I just saying?
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I can't remember for the life of me... Can you, Mavuika?
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hmm, something about wishing I dropped by your workshop more often, and how grateful you are that I keep pushing you to achieve the impossible...?
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "Life is like climbing a mountain &mdash; all the best views are at the top." You just give people that kind of... vibe.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' ...Wait, are you serious?
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Just kidding! I'll... try my best not to dump any more strange commissions on you.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' How in Teyvat have you two...
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Snap out of it, people! It's like you're all under some kind of spell! Quick, Kinich, think of something&mdash;
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Ajaw... I owe you an apology, too. I've been too harsh on you.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ajaw 05.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' !!!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It seems the evil power is completely gone. Were you the one who helped us?

:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 10.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Great job, Antu. Now that the Sacred Flame Crystals have been cleansed, we can use them to cure your friend.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 11.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Don't leave him hanging, go tell him the good news!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 milray 01.ogg}} '''Milray:''' Rawr?

:'''Milray & Naiyan:''' Raaawr...
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 12.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Thank you so much, all of you. This turned out even better than I imagined.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' See, told you it would all work out! Didn't I mention I'm an old hand at this whole argument game?
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You were this close to spilling the beans.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hear, hear! Even the kids of our tribe would have done a better job. Tell you what, we're lucky they don't speak our language...
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I couldn't help it! Besides, how was I supposed to, you know, criticize Kachina to her face like that?
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Mualani...! Actually, it was the same for me... Even though I knew it was all just an act, I didn't want to argue with you.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ajaw 06.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Huh? So you were all just playing pretend? Ugh, boooring. I'm going back to bed.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Now all that's left are the Ocean Zephyrs, right? I heard on the way over that we'd already found some, so it shouldn't take long...
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Everyone, over here!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Iansan! And... Whoa, that's a lot of saurians!
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' We've gathered enough Ocean Zephyrs! I asked them to give them to me, but they wanted to bring them over themselves.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' So we came together. Here, I think this should be enough.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 13.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Just hang on a moment, everyone. I'll go mix the ingredients.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 14.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Hey, Cacucu, dude! Less chat, more help.
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 cacucu 03.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Sure thing, bro. I've got you, bro.
:{{Black Screen|Ifa quickly prepares the medicine and feeds it to Milray.}}
:{{Black Screen|Now comes the most important step of all...}}
:{{A|vo nteq003 8 ifa 15.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Phew... This is it. The moment we've all been waiting for.

:{{A|vo nteq003 9 ifa 01.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Cheer up, bro. It's always tough to lose a friend, but in this case, our parting is their reunion.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 ifa 02.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Antu's already wandered the world for way too long, but now that you're all fixed up, he can be at peace.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 ifa 03.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' His final wish was to be reunited with his bro, and he's done that. We should be happy for him, just like he celebrated your recovery.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 milray 02.ogg}} '''Milray:''' Wrrooah!
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 ifa 04.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Thanks a ton, everyone. With your help, I've been able to do what my ancestor could not.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 ifa 05.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Not only did we save this little saurian from his torment, we also made a historic contribution to the study of phlogiston-related diseases.

:{{A|vo nteq003 9 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well said. Then without further ado, I hereby announce that the Bloomflower Trials have come to a successful close!
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' From my perspective, though, this competition had another meaning. Throughout the event, I didn't witness any arguments, scheming, or plotting for personal gain. All six tribes united to accomplish something truly remarkable.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even without the threat of the Abyss, we're still as close as family. We've surpassed those who came before us, and in the future, our people will surely grow more united still.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, in keeping with our traditions... It's time for a celebration. Let's make this a lively one, people!
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 together 01.ogg}} '''Mualani & Paimon:''' Woohoo!
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' As it happens, I picked a whole batch of fresh vegetables just yesterday. I'll go get them now.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Leave the meat to me.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And don't you dare skimp on it, Kinich.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I'll go gather the others. Many hands make light work, and besides, the best meals are always ones prepared together.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' See you tonight, everyone.
:{{A|vo nteq003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See you tonight! Hehe, Paimon's ready for a feast and a half...

:{{A|vo nteq003 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oooh, in that case, Paimon'd be glad to oblige!
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... good... Hehe, Paimon's tempted to eat the whole cake!

:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Yep, I'm feeling much better! I definitely was unsure about where my future lay for a while there.
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' But reading through those old scrolls, I realized that the six tribes haven't always been so united. They used to argue a lot, and even got into big fights...
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 06.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I've never experienced anything like that. I can barely imagine such a harsh way of life.
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 07.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I love Natlan the way it is today, and I love spending time with my friends! As Uncle Pacal once told me, the harder something is to come by, the more we should treasure it.
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 08.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' So I've decided to always do my best to help and make sure my friends are happy. Most importantly, I want us all to stay united, forever and ever!
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 09.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I haven't figured out exactly how I'm gonna do that... But I can start with what I'm good at, like baking delicious crackers and cakes to share with everyone!
:{{DIcon}} Kachina...
:{{DIcon}} You're a good kid.
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y'know what, Paimon just had an idea. You could open a cake shop!
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That way, Paimon would be able to enjoy your cakes even more often than she already does...
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 10.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' You really think so? I'll have to get Mualani to teach me how to run a shop then...
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 11.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Baking delicious desserts every day and making everyone smile... That does sound like a wonderful life!
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 12.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Thanks guys! I think I might've found a new goal to work towards.

:{{A|vo nteq003 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, Paimon hasn't seen Ifa or that Qucu-Thesaurus yet. Any idea where they went?
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 kachina 13.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Before the party, I heard he was planning on heading up that hill to pay respects to his ancestor. They're not back yet?
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If he doesn't get back soon, all the best food's gonna be gone!
:{{A|vo nteq003 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess we've got no choice but to take the cake with us and go check on them...

:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' It was just an illusion. If Granny had been the one doing it, she could've come up with something much more impressive.
:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Alright, alright, you can stop with the flattery. "Just an illusion?" Hmph, you're already good enough to fool me.

:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Relax, I'm not here to dig up the past. I'm just saying you've got a real knack for illusions &mdash; and that's something to be proud of!

:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Judging from my experience with the Pilgrimage, things are pretty quiet for a few days after competitions. There usually isn't much trouble.
:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, competitions do take a lot out of everyone. We all need a good rest.

::{{A|vo dialog nteq003 mavuika 03b 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh really? Well then, next time something like this comes up, don't forget to keep me in the loop.

;(Approach Ifa)
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 01.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Yo, ancestor man. Guess you're reunited with Antu already?
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 02.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' I have a Qucusaur companion too, so I totally get how you must've felt.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 03.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' First time I saw this dude, he was out in the wild, being bullied by other saurians because of his unusual appearance. He'd been pecked all over the place, bleeding from head to toe...
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 04.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' He barely made it. I gave him some meds, and from then on, he just stuck to me like glue. Even wound up becoming my assistant.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 cacucu 01.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Thanks, bro.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 05.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Hey, don't mention it, dude.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 06.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Being on the road with me as a vet was never gonna be an easy gig. One time, when we were treating a sick saurian, Cacucu got infected too.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 07.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' He ran a high fever, and I searched everywhere for ingredients and did everything I could for him. But despite giving it my all, he was right on the edge, man... and all I could do was keep praying.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 08.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' If he hadn't recovered, I know I'd have felt the same guilt you did.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 09.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Luckily, he managed to pull through, and he even stayed by my side helping me ever since. He's a solid assistant, no question.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 10.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' So yeah, Cacucu, I'm the one who should be thanking you.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 cacucu 02.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Hey, don't mention it, dude.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 11.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Your "medicine born of guilt"... Don't sweat it. We'll keep improving it as we go. You have my word.
:{{A|vo nteq003 11 ifa 12.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' That way, no one else will ever have to feel the same guilt that you did, ever again.

;(Talk to Ifa, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 ifa 01.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Huh? Yo, bros, what brings you guys here?
:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bringing our bros some cake, of course! Kachina made these herself, ya know &mdash; they're incredible!
:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 ifa 02.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' For real? In that case, I gotta&mdash;
:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 cacucu 01.ogg}} '''Cacucu:''' Oh wow, that's awesome, bro!
:{{A|vo dialog nteq003 ifa 03.ogg}} '''Ifa:''' Hey, save some for me!
