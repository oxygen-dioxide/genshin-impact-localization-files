==Trivia==
*The Chinese name of the soundtrack may be a reference to a poem by {{W|Liu Zongyan}}. The poem{{Lang|zh=别舍弟宗一|zh_tl=Seeing Off My Younger Cousin Zhongyi}} reads:
**{{zh|零落残魂倍黯然，双垂别泪越江边。<br>一身去国六千里，万死投荒十二年。<br>桂岭瘴来云似墨，洞庭春尽水如天。<br>欲知此后相思梦，长在荆门郢树烟。}}<br>Wandering in distraction, our bereft souls double their gloom, we both shed tears of parting at the riverbank.<br>A whole lifetime away from home six thousand miles, dying a thousand deaths in the wilderness twelve years.<br>At Guiling when the miasma comes, the clouds look like ink; at {{W|Dongting Lake|the Grotto Court}}, when spring ends the water resembles the sky.<br>If you want to know where from now on my dreams of longing will take me, it'll always be to {{W|Jingmen}} and {{W|Ying (Chu)|Ying}} among the misty trees.<ref>Translation by Hans H. Frankel, in ''The Flowering Plum and the Palace Lady: Interpretations of Chinese Poetry'', p. 149.</ref><br>
