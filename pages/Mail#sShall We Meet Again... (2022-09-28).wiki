|text    = Before we met, my birthday routine was meeting guests and receiving gifts. It embarrasses me to admit that although I tried my best to maintain proper etiquette, I felt a certain fatigue. It was as if my birthday was no different from other days. They were all... like a pond of still water.

But I no longer feel this way now, because ever since we met, your adventure stories have shown me that there's a vast world out there. The plants in the outskirts, the nations in distant lands... You've always told me about things that I aspire to experience.

I will be a year older after today, and I would like to mark the passing of time with something - I wish to become a better person and bring warmth and sunshine to people around me. Ah, it is fascinating how even trivial matters become interesting in our conversations. Perhaps, this is a talent only you possess.

Now, I wonder if we could meet again beneath the moonlight?
