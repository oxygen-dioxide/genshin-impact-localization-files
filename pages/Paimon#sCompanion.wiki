::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_razor_03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-huh! But the wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!

::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_dihuamarsh_02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes, and it's considered an elegant art in Liyue.

::{{DIcon}} Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_peelgrass_04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?

:{{DIcon}} About Swords
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_sabre_01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler), have you noticed?
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_sabre_02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In Inazuma, people who wear swords on their waists are a minority. Most soldiers use spears.
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_sabre_03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could it be that swords are a symbol of status... Should we wear them as well?
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_sabre_04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the swords here are all too big for Paimon... There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!
::{{DIcon}} A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_sabre_05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?
::{{DIcon}} ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_sabre_06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Really? Let's have a look!
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_sabre_07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Isn't that the knife we use to cut fruit?
::{{DIcon}} Well, at least it's the right size for you...
:::{{DIcon}} Ahem, "What matters isn't the value of the sword..."
:::{{DIcon}} "It's the fighting spirit."
::{{A|vo_paimon_mimitomo_sabre_08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice try, but Paimon won't fall for this, no matter how cool it sounds!

:{{DIcon}} About [[Canned Knowledge]]...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo cannedknowledge 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Free knowledge without having to study at all? Canned Knowledge is amazing!
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo cannedknowledge 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could Sumeru have Canned Knowledge about the different customs of the seven nations, too?
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo cannedknowledge 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If so, Paimon could just open a can every time we get to a new place. Paimon wouldn't have to explain things ever again!
::{{DIcon}} Or we could just open them all...
::{{DIcon}} Here in Sumeru...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo cannedknowledge 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... but traveling wouldn't be any fun without surprises to look forward to!
::{{DIcon}} Plus, if we opened them all here...
::{{DIcon}} I wouldn't even need Paimon as a guide anymore.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo cannedknowledge 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay scrap that idea! No more Canned Knowledge. Let's save our Mora for something else!
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo cannedknowledge 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Something like... Oh! Tipping Paimon for guide services! Heehee, seems fair, right?

::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo gildedbrigade 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Eremites are a real motley crew...
::{{DIcon}} There's certainly a diverse range of characters.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo gildedbrigade 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmmm... yeah, that could explain it! Paimon can play lots of different characters too.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo gildedbrigade 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Judgy Paimon, knowledgeable Paimon, helpful Paimon...
::{{DIcon}} ...And of course the classic, completely-misses-the-point Paimon.

:{{DIcon}} About the [[Grand Bazaar]]...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo grandbazaar 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The residents of the Grand Bazaar are all so talented!
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo grandbazaar 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They sell their own woven goods, beautiful vases and jars, and delicious-smelling spices that make Paimon's tummy start rumbling...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo grandbazaar 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And they all sing and dance really well! Paimon wishes she could do that.
::{{DIcon}} Well, if you're serious about it, there's no reason you couldn't learn.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo grandbazaar 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? Really?
::{{DIcon}} Well for starters...
:::{{DIcon}} You won't trip over yourself...
:::{{DIcon}} Or accidentally step on someone else's foot...
::{{DIcon}} You have a natural advantage when it comes to dancing.
:::{{DIcon}} You won't trip over yourself...
:::{{DIcon}} Or accidentally step on someone else's foot...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo grandbazaar 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah! Paimon always forgets how useful flying can be!
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo grandbazaar 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright then! Let's go bust a move at the Grand Bazaar and watch everyone shower Paimon with admiration!
::{{DIcon}} Aha, so that's what this is all about.

:{{DIcon}} About Divination...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo divination 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' People in Sumeru seem to take divination and fortune-telling pretty seriously.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo divination 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For starters, there's astrology, although only the scholars get to practice that. But ordinary citizens have their ways, too. They can do divinations with just a cup of coffee!
::{{DIcon}} It's the nation of wisdom after all...
::{{DIcon}} It seems like people have an insatiable curiosity to learn about everything, including their own future.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo divination 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon heard that they can tell your fate just by looking at the bottom of a finished cup of coffee...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo divination 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds way easier than climbing to the top of a tower and staring at the stars all night!
::{{DIcon}} Are you interested in learning your fate, too?
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo divination 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... although, Paimon's really more interested in finding out what the coffee tastes like.

::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo homeofhealth 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, healthcare is FREE in Sumeru?
::{{DIcon}} Are you feeling unwell, Paimon?
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo homeofhealth 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, not right now. Thanks for asking, though.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo homeofhealth 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Eating the street food on every corner has never sounded so tempting!
::{{DIcon}} Your stomach is going to punish you for that!
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo homeofhealth 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If so, Paimon'll go see a doctor and get treated &mdash; it's all for free! It'd be a waste not to take advantage of this, don't you think?
::{{DIcon}} Maybe... but then again...
::{{DIcon}} The treatment would likely include a restricted diet.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo homeofhealth 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* Oh no! So no more delicious food, then?
::{{DIcon}} That, plus the doctor would make you take the most bitter-tasting medicine ever.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo homeofhealth 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' O&mdash;Okay... Maybe Paimon needs to reconsider this idea...

:{{DIcon}} About the Scholars...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So many people in Sumeru want to become scholars.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Motivated by this ambition, they all study really hard to try and achieve it...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Paimon bets that the first ever scholar didn't set out to become a scholar...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... so what do you think the first ever scholar's ambition was?
::{{DIcon}} Probably...
::{{DIcon}} To get their research paper written as quickly as possible.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But isn't a scholar's ultimate goal supposed to be "pursuing the highest and greatest knowledge" or something?
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's sure that it must have been because of a fervent desire for knowledge that they became Sumeru's first true scholar.
::{{DIcon}} Writing papers is how you pursue knowledge.
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But what about when it's the highest and greatest knowledge of all...
::{{DIcon}} Even then, if you wanted to prove it, you'd need a research paper.
:::{{DIcon}} And after that, you'd need to start working on another paper
:::{{DIcon}} To validate your original thesis...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' O&mdash;Okay, Paimon's got it! Come on, don't look so sad! It's not like you have to worry about writing papers yourself!
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo scholar 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Y&mdash;You've never had to write a paper before, right...?

::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo aranaraname 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The only bit Paimon's sure of is that they all start with "Ara"!
::{{DIcon}} Right, so if you were an Aranara...
::{{DIcon}} Your name would be "Arapaimon."
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo aranaraname 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, and as for you...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo aranaraname 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, actually, they'd probably call you "Nara Traveler"...
::{{DIcon}} Yeah, we're all Nara to them...
::{{A|vo paimon mimitomo aranaraname 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So if there was someone whose actual name was "Nara," what would the Aranara call them?
::{{DIcon}} "Nara Nara"... I guess. Sounds kinda cute.
