{{Quest Description|Mavuika's spirit enters the Night Kingdom at a critical moment to extract everyone. She seems to still be at the Speaker's Chambers. Time to go visit her.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Mavuika)
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, there's a lot less stuff here than before...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's good to see you all here in one piece.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I know you must have a lot of questions, but let [[Chuychu]] check you over first. It's best not to let any lingering effects of the [[Abyss]] go untreated.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chuychu 01.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Thank goodness you made it back! I came here as soon as the Pyro Archon told me about your plan.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chuychu 02.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Take a seat, everybody. I'll examine you one by one...
:{{Black Screen|Despite the short stint in the Night Kingdom, Mualani and the others all have some degree of Abyssal contamination.}}
:{{Black Screen|But, thanks to Chuychu's extensive experience treating Abyssal contamination, the harmful effects will not be permanent.}}
:{{Black Screen|The treatment also relieves Kachina's symptoms.}}
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Alright, that should do it for now. But just to be safe, I'll perform another check-up in a couple of days.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chuychu 04.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I have to say, though... I've never seen anyone react to the Abyss like you, Traveler. It's like you're completely immune to its power.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 02b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s always been special like that. {{MC|m=He|f=She}} can even purify its power. Wait, now that you mention it, Paimon doesn't think she's affected, either...
:{{DIcon}} We don't know why, though.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Given the current situation, that ability will likely play a great role in the events to come.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chuychu 05.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Of course! I still have patients to see, so I'll head out.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Thank you, Chuychu.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chuychu 06.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Alright, alright... We might not see eye to eye, but we both had good intentions.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chuychu 07.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Just give it time. I'm sure we'll figure things out between us one day.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yeah...
:;(Chuychu leaves)
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Alright... There's so much to discuss, I don't even know where to begin. You've seen it for yourselves, now... the devastation in the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...I'll get straight to the point. Natlan is on the verge of destruction. It's very possible our nation has less than a year before total devastation.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' N&mdash;N&mdash;No... Th&mdash;That can't be true, can it!?
:{{DIcon}} Less than a year...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right, but I've only ever disclosed that fact to the handful of people working with me to save this nation.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Our looming destruction is not a recent development, but the inevitable conclusion of the disaster the Abyss initiated [[Cataclysm|five hundred years ago]].
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Mualani]] told us a little bit about that...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Five hundred years ago, all the nations of [[Teyvat]] were invaded by the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Unlike the other nations, Natlan never had stable and deep-rooted [[Ley Line]]s, so we suffered the worst of the invasion.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The battle against the Abyss was exceedingly long and brutal. In the end, victory came at the cost of our civilization and countless lives.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even then, it took centuries of solving the disasters caused by the Abyss to finally achieve the peace we know today.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Still, this is but a superficial victory. The forces of the Abyss have merely been driven back underground &mdash; their threat to Natlan remains as real as ever.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I&mdash;I'd never have guessed...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The problems plaguing the Night Kingdom are all the more complicated because that realm is essentially functioning as Natlan's Ley Lines.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Immediately after the war, our calculations estimated that we would have a maximum of five hundred years before the Night Kingdom was completely lost to the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But at that time, we were a nation of the destitute. Our people no longer believed in victory, nor did they hold hope for the future.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Our civilization was dying, our faith crumbling, and the line of power passed down from the [[Wayob]] nearly severed...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If we didn't bring the nation back together, it would be foolish to even dream of defeating the Abyss in the future.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, the Archon had a long and involved discussion with the heroes of each tribe, and finally came up with a five hundred year-long plan to save Natlan.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So that's what happened...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' After finding Kachina, I encountered a strange figure who gave me a series of new memories.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Since the plan was mentioned in those memories... I guess I've been chosen to play an important role in it.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But, there's still something I don't understand. Those memories showed me the [[Pyro Archon]] from back then... and it was you.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? But, that doesn't make any sense! The Pyro Archon is supposed to be human. It's impossible for a human to live that long!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right. The hardest thing for humans to overcome has always been time &mdash; or rather, the natural limitations of our lifespan.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 21.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A god can extend a human's life by using a certain amount of divine power, or subjecting them to a curse.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, as we all know, Natlan doesn't have gods like that. We can only rely on our own methods.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 23.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A human life is like a flame destined to be extinguished. Five hundred years ago, I placed my life within the [[Sacred Flame]].
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 24.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Only by dying before my time could I have the chance to wake up again.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' So, in other words, this is your... second life?
:{{DIcon}} That was all part of the plan?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 25.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes. We only managed to defeat the Abyss all those years ago because the tribes came together as one.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 26.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If the Natlan of the future was to have a fighting chance, the Pyro Archons that came after the war had to rebuild the decimated tribes.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 27.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The goal was to reunite the people and restore the strength of each tribe's Wayob.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 28.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Once a tribe was back to its full strength, the tribe's Wayob would select a "hero," indicating the tribe was once again ready for war.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 29.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The chosen would then stand by my side in defense of our nation, just like great heroes of old, five hundred years ago.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So that means... I'm one of the chosen?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 30.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right. You bear the [[Ancient Name]], "Umoja," the same one held by [[Tupac|the hero]] from your tribe five hundred years ago. It means "unity."
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 31.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' After your adventure in the Night Kingdom, I trust you've come to fully understand the meaning of that Name.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, in other words... You always knew who the Wayob were going to pick from each tribe?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 32.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes. According to the plan, each tribe was supposed to have been fully restored by the time I awoke. But, something went wrong along the way...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 33.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The six heroes successfully inherited the Ancient Names from five hundred years ago, but the intel regarding the plan wasn't passed on to them.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 34.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Once again, it comes down to the deterioration of the Night Kingdom. Communication between the Sacred Flame and the Wayob has been blocked.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Just like how the [[Ode of Resurrection]] failed to bring Kachina back.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 35.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Exactly. It's just another tactic the Abyss is using against us. The Abyss may not possess intelligence, but its methods certainly aren't easy to counter.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 36.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If we want to unblock that information from being passed on, my presence alone isn't enough. The Ancient Name bearer must establish a greater connection to their Name.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 37.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, I've tried my best to help them from the sidelines.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 38.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Currently, [[Xilonen]] of the [[Children of Echoes]], [[Kinich]] of the [[Scions of the Canopy]], and [[Iansan]] of the [[Collective of Plenty]] have all been acknowledged by their Names.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 39.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' During your adventure, you, too, earned the acknowledgement of your Wayob, Mualani. In the process, you gained the memories stored within your Name.
:{{DIcon}} That leaves two people left...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, we have less than a year...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 40.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes, but we have no choice. We cannot start the plan until all the heroes have been gathered.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 41.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's also why I haven't been able to take action despite the urgency of the situation.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But, if you knew this whole time, why didn't you just tell me about my role in all this? Wouldn't that make everything go a lot faster?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 42.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Perhaps, but the opposite could also be true. Knowing your destiny too early could mean failing to realize your full potential.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 43.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Just like your determination to save Kachina, I hope your commitment to this endeavor comes from your own strength of will, rather than a sense of obligation.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' So, I suppose you're not going to tell us who the final two heroes are, then...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 44.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right. Their "time" is yet to come. Putting pressure on them beforehand will only hinder their development.
:{{DIcon}} But what if they don't make it in time...?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 45.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I can only trust in the judgment of the Wayob.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 46.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I have never believed I could solve this crisis alone. In fact, it was precisely because I chose to trust and rely on others that we managed to get this far.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 47.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Natlan's salvation lies not in its Archon, or any singular individual, but in us all.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Does that mean, you...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 48.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You're quite perceptive, aren't you? I thought I might get away with avoiding the topic.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh, right! All the stuff you stored here before... Where did it go?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 49.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even though I sacrificed my power, I still needed a contingency plan to ensure you would make it back from the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 50.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' After all, I was the one who allowed you to take that risk, and Mualani has an important role to play in my plan.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 51.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' In addition to their sentimental value, the items I stored here held a much more important purpose &mdash; "fuel."
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Fuel? Ah, so back then, that's why you...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 52.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes. The stories embodied by those items are certainly important, but there's an even more significant trait they all share &mdash; every item belonged to a hero of Natlan.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 53.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Over time, they became imbued with a certain amount of [[Contending Fire]] from being carried in battle.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 54.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' On their own, each item's power is limited, but, together, their combined effect can prove quite useful in a dire situation.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 55.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' By burning those items, I was able to activate the Contending Fire stored within them to open the boundary between the two worlds.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 56.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It was a rather crude approach, so all their power was depleted in an instant, as you can see.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, weren't they all precious treasures? What about their stories...?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' *sigh* That's exactly why I dragged you all here... No matter what, I never wanted the Pyro Archon to have to use that power.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I'm so sorry...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 57.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You have nothing to be sorry for. You all deserve my thanks, actually. If you hadn't saved the totem pole, that area of the Night Kingdom would have been forever lost to the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 58.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Then, it would only be a matter of time before the Children of Echoes was met with disaster.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 59.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Besides, when those heroes entrusted their belongings to me, or the Pyro Archon of their time, it was out of a desire to contribute to Natlan's survival.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 60.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If they knew those items helped save the present-day heroes of Natlan, they would not mourn their loss.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Even when you put it that way, I still feel bad...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 61.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hehe, there's no need. Remember what I told you about "time"?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 62.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The people and events of the past are never truly lost to us. We simply carry them with us in a different form. In that sense, we didn't lose anything at all.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 63.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If you still have regrets, let them fuel your resolve in the battles to come.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 64.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Your deeds will become new legends and nurture new forms of power, just like the items once stored here.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we'd still like to return the favor...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 65.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, if that's the case, just treat me to a drink sometime.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 66.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Now that Kachina has returned, we can finally hold the victory feast and celebrate your team's triumph in the [[Night Warden Wars]].
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 67.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We could all use the rest, that's for sure. Plus, you'll be able to silence everyone who doubted you once and for all, Kachina.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' *sigh* Still, now that I know the danger we're facing, having a victory feast doesn't feel right...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 68.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Try not to let it get to you. It's important to stay calm. Worrying about it will only affect your judgement.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 11 mavuika 69.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Alright, you should head out. I'll join you in a bit.
:;(Everyone leaves except Mavuika, who sits at her desk)
----
;(The scene changes to walkways and towers in a foggy space with Natlan's emblem glowing in the sky)
:;(Mavuika stands on the top of the tower with [[Atea]])
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 01.ogg}} '''Atea:''' When I was young, I used to sit by the hot springs and listen to the stories of warriors from all over Natlan.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 02.ogg}} '''Atea:''' They attract people from all walks of life. Friends come easy here, no matter what tribe you're from.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 03.ogg}} '''Atea:''' The [[People of the Springs]] have never claimed the hot springs as their own private property. They are there to bring all "hot spring buddies" together.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 04.ogg}} '''Atea:''' It's been really nice, seeing the children of my tribe get older. It's helped me gradually understand the true value of the springs.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 05.ogg}} '''Atea:''' I've witnessed their energy, their determination, their absolute passion for life...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 06.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Even when they cause trouble, I never manage to hold on to my anger for long. It's unbelievable how quickly they worm their way back into my good graces.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 07.ogg}} '''Atea:''' I'm certain Mualani will become a great warrior when she grows up. She possesses infinite potential... I can see it.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 08.ogg}} '''Atea:''' One day, when I'm no longer in fighting form, I'll come here and tell stories to all the children, just like those warriors did for me.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 atea 09.ogg}} '''Atea:''' So, you better get busy, Pyro Archon, or I'll end up running out of stories, hahaha.
:;(Atea disappears and a walkway to the next tower forms)
:;(Mavuika walks across where she is met with [[Tenoch]])
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 tenoch 01.ogg}} '''[[Tenoch]]:''' Our nation is engulfed in darkness, our tribes stand divided, and yet you promise victory in the distant future...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 tenoch 02.ogg}} '''Tenoch:''' The Abyss is a cunning enemy, one that I've faced in battle many times. Were that not the case, I would never understand exercising this degree of caution.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 tenoch 03.ogg}} '''Tenoch:''' My rage will never know absolution, and my power will no longer aid you in victory.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 tenoch 04.ogg}} '''Tenoch:''' But, you came to me because you knew you could convince me with just a single sentence.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 tenoch 05.ogg}} '''Tenoch:''' I understand your choice. The heroes of today will forge the path ahead with blood and fire. Just remember to earn us the victory we're owed.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 tenoch 06.ogg}} '''Tenoch:''' Otherwise, rest assured, I'll find a way to collect the debt.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 tenoch 07.ogg}} '''Tenoch:''' ..."For Natlan."
:;(Tenoch disappears and Mavuika takes the next walkway where she finds [[Hine]] and [[Haumia]])
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 hine 01.ogg}} '''Hine:''' So... you're gonna head five hundred years in the future to serve as the Pyro Archon again...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 hine 02.ogg}} '''Hine:''' But, what about the you from right now? You're just gonna die?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 haumia 01.ogg}} '''Haumia:''' You can't ask her those questions and expect her to answer, my dear. The decision is hers to make, and she deserves our support.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 haumia 02.ogg}} '''Haumia:''' We will do everything we can to rebuild the tribes. Don't you worry.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 haumia 03.ogg}} '''Haumia:''' Even across time, we will all do our part to fight for Natlan's future.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 hine 03.ogg}} '''Hine:''' Yeah, mom's right! We'll always believe in you, Sis!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 hine 04.ogg}} '''Hine:''' Seriously, though, Dad should be here. Where is he?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 haumia 04.ogg}} '''Haumia:''' I&mdash;I imagine he&mdash;he didn't know what to say, so he chose not to come at all. Don't take it to heart, my dear, that's just who he is.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 haumia 05.ogg}} '''Haumia:''' Just remember &mdash; no matter what happens in the future, we will always love you.
:;(Haumia disappears and Mavuika begins to take the next walkway)
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 hine 05.ogg}} '''Hine:''' I'll come find you one day!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 hine 06.ogg}} '''Hine:''' I know I can't live that long, but I'll think of something!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 hine 07.ogg}} '''Hine:''' There has to be a way for us to meet again one day! If there's an answer out there somewhere, I'm gonna find it!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 hine 08.ogg}} '''Hine:''' So, don't forget about me!
:;(Hine disappears and Mavuika continues walking along the path where [[Ngendi]], [[Kalunga]], [[Fietena]], and [[Nzambe]] also give their final words before disappearing)
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 ngendi 01.ogg}} '''Ngendi:''' If that's your decision, then you have my full support, Archon.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 kalunga 01.ogg}} '''Kalunga:''' May our children live to see such a lovely sun.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 12 fietena 01.ogg}} '''Fietena:''' For Natlan.

:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Chuychu! You here for the victory feast, too?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 01.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Oh, no. I knew Chasca would be here, so I just came to deliver some medicine. I was about to leave, actually.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 02.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' It's not that I don't want to celebrate Kachina and the others. I'm so glad she made it back, it's just... I'll make things awkward if I'm around my sister right now.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, well, you two had a fight, so Paimon can understand...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' She didn't cause any trouble during your trip, right?
:{{DIcon}} Of course not.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, she was super helpful! She gave us a lot of useful information about the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 04.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' That's good. That's all I needed to know.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is there a reason you asked? You were pretty outspoken when we first met, but now it's like you're holding something back...
:{{DIcon}} You can tell us anything.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 05.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 06.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Maybe it seemed unreasonable, picking that fight with her before you left. But, I did it for a reason.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 07.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Her impulse to fight is extremely strong. Her mental strength helps her rein it in, but she still loses control sometimes. I had no idea what you might face in the Night Kingdom, so I didn't want to take any chances...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what you're saying is...
:{{DIcon}} You deliberately provoked her so she'd take that impulse out on you?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 08.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Okay, so maybe it sounds a little... stupid. But, it works pretty well. It helps her keep her cool for a little while, at least.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 09.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Anyway, I'm just glad you were able to make it back safe and sound. That's all I wanted.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, do you really have to go that far? Can't you just... talk it out?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 10.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' No way. Chasca never opens up about her own pain, especially to her family. She can't learn about this, or it'll be even harder to help her.
:{{DIcon}} I respect your decision.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for confiding in us.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 11.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I appreciate the understanding, and don't worry &mdash; I'll find a way to help her ease this burden. Anyway, I need to get going. Enjoy the celebration.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 chuychu 12.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Oh, and, if you ever need a doctor, you know who to find!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Who would've thought there was a deeper reason behind their arguing...
:{{DIcon}} They're trying to look out for each other in their own way.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In the end, it's all the Abyss' fault. Paimon's had enough of them! Hmph!

:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 sabea 01.ogg}} '''Sabea:''' Well done, Kachina!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Th&mdash;Thank you, everyone! I'm so glad I finally made it.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 weqro 01.ogg}} '''Weqro:''' I always knew you could do it! With so much potential at your age, you have a great future ahead of you!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 pacal 02.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' You're one to talk! Don't think I didn't know you were the first person to abandon your team. I'll be dealing with you when we get back.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 weqro 02.ogg}} '''Weqro:''' I&mdash;I had no choice! My friend invited me, I couldn't just say no!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 sabea 02.ogg}} '''Sabea:''' Oh really? So you weren't just trying to get ahead in the first round?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 weqro 03.ogg}} '''Weqro:''' I wasn't, I swear! I just happened to find that bearer injured in the wild, so I stopped to bandage his wounds.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 weqro 04.ogg}} '''Weqro:''' When he insisted on repaying the favor, what was I supposed to do? I'm just one person, I figured Kachina would have no trouble replacing me.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 pacal 03.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' But the fact of the matter is that after your departure, everyone else started thinking about swapping teams too.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 tlaco 01.ogg}} '''Tlaco:''' I'm really sorry, Kachina... It was wrong of us to abandon you like that.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 cempoa 01.ogg}} '''Cempoa:''' It's amazing that you still made it all the way through to the Night Warden Wars... That's the highest honor.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' So, uh, wh&mdash;what about you guys? Did you make it far?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 tlaco 02.ogg}} '''Tlaco:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 cempoa 02.ogg}} '''Cempoa:''' Our team captain drank too much the night before the competition, and turned up late to the stadium on the day... We got disqualified.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 pacal 04.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' Hahaha, serves you all right! No sympathy from me.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Alright, alright. There's no need to be like that, Uncle [[Pacal]].
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Um, dear friends, I'd like to say a few words...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Firstly, I'm grateful to my friends and our Great Archon for helping to bring me back.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 06b.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' This Traveler and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} companion Paimon are some of the strongest people I've ever met. If they were allowed to participate in the [[Pilgrimage]], I have no doubt that they'd win the whole thing.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 07a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 07b.ogg}}--> '''Kachina:''' They've agreed to let me learn from them. With their help, I believe I can become even stronger still!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 08a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 08b.ogg}}--> '''Kachina:''' And let's not forget my good friends, Mualani, Chasca, Kinich, and Iansan... They all helped the Traveler and Paimon figure out a way to bring me back from the Night Kingdom...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 09.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' They, too, deserve to be called our heroes. So... please give another round of applause, for them. Thank you so much!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 teayo 02.ogg}} '''Teayo:''' Well said!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 sabea 03.ogg}} '''Sabea:''' I'll drink to that!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, how does it feel being a hero, Kachina?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 10.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' To be honest, it's a bit overwhelming... It all just feels so surreal...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you'd better get used to it! Next stop, undefeated champion!
:{{DIcon}} That way, I'll also become a champion coach.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 14 kachina 11.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Hey, please don't make fun of me...

;(Talk to Kinich, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' My apologies. I knew more than I let on.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Everything comes at a price, and most heroes aren't people who set out to become a hero.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' If you cling too tightly to your goal, you end up losing things that are far more precious.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But in any case, we're now on the same page.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I wonder how long before the two final heroes appear, from the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] and the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]...

;(Talk to Kachina, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I've been through so much all at once. Everything still kinda feels like a dream.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you still feeling unwell?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Nope, all better now! Hehe, I told you I bounce back pretty quick. So don't worry about me.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I bet you guys must be tired, though. Make sure you get some good rest tonight. You gotta recharge so you'll be in the mood to have fun!

;(Talk to Iansan, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' It cost us a lot, but we got Kachina back safely, and that's what matters.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' There'll be even tougher challenges coming our way in the days ahead, though. We'll have to train harder, make sure we're in peak condition.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That includes you, Paimon. I can do a special one-off session to show you the ropes, interested?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, n&mdash;no thanks...

;(Talk to Mualani, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' At previous victory feasts, you'd always find me in the crowd, singing and dancing. But after what I found out today... It's too much. I'm still trying to process it.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It does feel weird, seeing you so out of sorts...
:{{DIcon}} Natlan's fall isn't set in stone though, right?
:{{DIcon}} It's important to try and enjoy moments like this when they come along.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Is this another pearl of wisdom based on your adventuring experience?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon agrees with {{Traveler}}! Everyone's come together to celebrate Kachina's achievements. That's gotta be a first.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You're right. Hehe, Kachina looks really happy. And now I'm being the moody one...
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Ugh, enough doom and gloom. Time to shake it off!

;(Talk to Mualani again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, Kachina! Let's party!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I&mdash;I'm a little embarrassed...
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Don't be! Come on, you're the star of the show today!

;(Talk to Chasca, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It's rare to meet travelers as strong and brave as yourselves. I raise my glass to you.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Anyway, my sister's already gone back to our tribe. She has patients to treat.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we actually ran into her on our way here, and uhh... Well, Paimon just thinks she really cares about you!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yeah... I'm planning on visiting home myself in a few days, to tell her and the rest of the family that they need to be extra careful. I just hope they'll take it seriously.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The Abyss has likely sensed your arrival in Natlan by now. So exercise caution on your adventures as well.

;(Talk to Mavuika)
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ah, you're here. Have some fruit juice &mdash; I got it specially for you two.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How did you know? That's Paimon's favorite!
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You look like you've still got questions. Ask away.
:{{DIcon}} Isn't your plan a little convoluted?
:{{DIcon}} Why didn't you get the heroes of the past to join you in this age?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Because they had their own lives to live.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The thought of telling them, abandon your families and everyone you love, and come with me to the end of time, for in five hundred years, Natlan will be destroyed... It seemed too cruel.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You could just as easily point out that everything in this world will come to an end eventually. But life is short, and beyond a point it just doesn't seem real.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Imagine if I said, "Let's leave right now and go save the sun, because it'll flame out in a few million years"... It would sound quite ridiculous.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I couldn't make them shoulder that burden with me.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Besides, every generation will have its heroes, this one included. The plan could still work without them.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Or of course, without me. But since I was the one who came up with the plan, I felt duty-bound to see it through to the end.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's suddenly remembering that portrait in your room. Was that... your family from back then?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes, it was. So when you asked me who my sister grew up to be, the truth is that very little information survives.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' From what I've been able to piece together, I can conclude with a reasonable degree of confidence that she ended up as an architect and artist.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' She played an instrumental role in rebuilding the Scions of the Canopy tribe, designing and building many houses. But of course, none of her buildings are around anymore.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Still, it was an impressive achievement, and I'm very proud of her.
:{{DIcon}} So that's the life you had to leave behind...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You feel loss keenly. It seems to stir up feelings of regret in you... But this is something I have long since come to terms with.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' This is a war, and there can be no war without loss. I am already far more fortunate than those who lost their lives to the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The people of Natlan look to me as their Archon, and the weight of their expectations is mine to bear. I must see our fate through to the very end, no matter what I may find there.
:{{DIcon}} That's actually what I wanted to ask...
:{{DIcon}} If you're already aware of "fate"...
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, doesn't that mean the way everything ends has already been written, including your plan?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I suppose, but so what? Don't forget, time takes many forms. The past, present, and future co-exist, and all are equally important.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even if the future ends in destruction, that's still no reason to give up on the here and now.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And it's precisely because we humans cannot know our fate that we will never give up on our struggle.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' This is a pivotal moment. We are still two heroes short.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 21.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well... three, to be precise. There's one further hero who I'm hoping to get on my side, whatever it takes.
:{{DIcon}} ...Surely you don't mean me?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Your resistance to the corrupting power of the Abyss is truly remarkable. It would easily make you an all-important figure in the upcoming battle.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 23.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If you agree to join us, you will not only gain my full support in your journey, but I will also forge a brand new Ancient Name for you.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ancient Names... can be forged?
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 24.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' They can. Several strict conditions must be met, but if they couldn't be forged at all, then the number of them in circulation would have long dwindled to zero.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 25.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Possessing an ancient name would mean that your adventures in Natlan are recorded in full. Your stories would be remembered by our people for all the years to come.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 26.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Ode of Resurrection may have temporarily lost its power, but still... Take this as my personal guarantee that I shall never let you fall.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 27.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Just like in the Night Kingdom, I will be there for you. That is a promise I will fulfill at all costs. This nation always honors its heroes.
:{{DIcon}} You don't have to promise me anything.
:{{DIcon}} I just want to help out the people.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we can't just ignore the situation here.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 28.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Wonderful. Then I'll reach out to Xilonen right away. She's the one who will forge the Name.
:{{A|vo ntaq008 15 mavuika 29.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We've never forged an Ancient Name for an outlander before, but I trust she'll find a way.

:{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh, something else you'd like to ask?
:{{DIcon}} About [[The Captain]]'s whereabouts...
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02a 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, our intel suggests he hasn't made any new movements yet. Although, Kinich's investigation helped us confirm that he is being aided by someone from the Masters of the Night-Wind.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02a 2.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'm getting closer to narrowing down who that may be, but it's still unclear whether this person aided The Captain out of willingness or coercion.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02a 3.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If you learn anything about this during your adventures, please let me know.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Elemental energy and the Abyss...
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02b 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Abyss is the most formidable enemy in all of Teyvat. In the beginning, it took failure and tragedy to even begin to learn how to fight back.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02b 2.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' All of the methods you've seen in other nations were developed based on experience and insight passed down over generations. We know them to work, but few of us actually understand why.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02b 3.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's the same for the method we use here in Natlan. Ever since ancient times, Elemental energy has been one of our most reliable weapons against the Abyss.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02b 4.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As for the principles behind it... I'm afraid you might have to seek answers from someone older than the position of Pyro Archon itself.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the absence of people from Natlan in other nations...
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02c 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ah, that also comes down to the longstanding effects of the Abyss. Our people's survival is inextricably tied to the Wayob.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02c 2.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, their power has its limits. They cannot offer our people the same degree of protection outside our borders. In fact, people who do decide to leave often suffer from memory loss and emotional issues.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02c 3.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Everyone in Natlan understands this. That's why our people never leave without a good cause. Even if someone is left with no choice, the chief of their tribe must seek approval with the Wayob to grant them leave.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02c 4.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Wayob have always been very strict about granting that approval, since extending protection beyond our borders means consuming power reserved for our fight against the Abyss.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq008 mavuika 02c 5.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Still, there's no need to worry. The Wayob extend their protection to all within Natlan, including visitors from afar.
