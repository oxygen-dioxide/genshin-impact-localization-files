|desc_basic      = All the ingredients were sliced into ribbons in a single go, and after being washed, they were placed into the broth and cooked till they floated. The resulting flavor is light and fresh, and would not be out of place as a chef's recommendation in a Liyue restaurant.
|desc_delicious  = The tofu, thread-thin as the autumn leaves, floats amidst the bowl, like mist in a forest, and the shredded bamboo shoots give the image a sweet, lustrous sheen, while the broth combines the essence of fowl and ham, giving off an unbelievable aroma. A single taste is enough to cause the customer to lose themselves in this fog of flavor.

==Trivia==
* Whilst the recipe makes mention of {{w|Oncidium}} (a type of orchid), it is typically not used in cooking.
* Rather, the real-life counterpart to this recipe is the real-life [http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/cooking/2014-06/04/content_622415.htm Wensi Tofu] (文思豆腐，Wénsī dòufu), a Chinese delicacy and tofu soup associated with Jiangsu cuisine.
** The use of oncidium in the name for this dish was likely inspired from the original use of dried daylilies in the original Qing version of this dish.
** The actual dish itself mainly consists of tofu cut into fine shreds (5000+ shreds, as the story goes), mixed with bamboo shoots, shredded ham, and mushrooms. Some variants also use shredded chicken breast (hence the ingredients for the actual in-game recipe).
