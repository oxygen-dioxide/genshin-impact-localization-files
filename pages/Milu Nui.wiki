==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Milu Nui:''' Don't tell me... That guy [[Pakaa Nui|Pakaa]] moved my records to the children's section again!
:{{DIcon}} And who's Pakaa?
::'''Milu Nui:''' Ah, he's the one at Xochicuicatl Records.
::'''Milu Nui:''' Have you been? Although Pakaa isn't the most reliable guy, he's got good taste, and they even carry some of my records.
::'''Milu Nui:''' There are tracks that you can listen to for free. Don't miss out!
::'''Milu Nui:''' ...Oh and, please let me know what you think after you've listened to it. Like... does my music really sound like it's meant for children?
::{{DIcon}} I've not heard. What do other people say?
::'''Milu Nui:''' *sigh*... Well, everyone agrees. That's why Pakaa keeps moving my records from the popular section to the children's section.
::'''Milu Nui:''' Really, shouldn't a musician have the right to say what genre of music their work is supposed to be?
::'''Milu Nui:''' Besides, if you really think about it, I'm Pakaa's uncle! That brat, no respect for his elders...
::'''Milu Nui:''' Ah well, there's no point continuing to be mad at him. He rarely listens to what I have to say, but at least he's got a knack for running a store.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Milu Nui:''' Leaving already? Alright.
