{{Main|Traveler}}
{{Pyro}} is the sixth [[Element]] the [[Traveler]] acquires after completing the {{Quest|Where All Hopes Lie}}. It can subsequently be swapped to by resonating with the [[Statue of The Seven]] in [[Natlan]] or the [[Throne of the Primal Fire]] in [[Ochkanatlan]].

The Traveler has 2 sets of constellations in Pyro alignment. The first set of 6 constellations are unlocked at once during [[Where All Hopes Lie]], and can subsequently only be used while fighting [[Lord of Eroded Primal Fire]]. The second set of 6 constellations can be unlocked by offering {{Item|Blazing Flint Ore}} through [[Primal Flame Resonance]], and can be used anywhere.
