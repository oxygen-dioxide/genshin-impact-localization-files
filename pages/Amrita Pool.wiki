{{Description|The original Amrita nourished the Vourukasha Oasis and many kinds of Khvarena. The Amrita Pool is only a clear spring overflowing from it. Through this, the mayflies of Khvarena flow down into the underground roots, returning to the embrace of the Harvisptokhm.}}
The {{Location Intro|description=<p>The Amrita Pool is an overflow of the [[Amrita]] surrounding Vourukasha Oasis that has formed into a small spring in a nearby cave.</p>}}

[[Offering]] [[Plume of Purifying Light|Plumes of Purifying Light]] to the Amrita Pool will increase [[The Gift of Amrita]] level and provide rewards.

Access to the Amrita Pool is unlocked by completing ''[[Heart of Amrita]]'', which is available after completing the {{Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}.

==Lore==
The Amrita was created during the [[cataclysm]] five hundred years ago, when [[Egeria]], the previous Hydro Archon, was killed at [[Tunigi Hollow]] while fighting against the monsters and corruption spewing into [[Teyvat]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Vibrant Pinion}}</ref> [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] grew the [[Harvisptokhm]] from the Amrita, which anchored Egeria's consciousness to the mortal realm and allowed her to serve as a seal over the dark hollow.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref> However, the Amrita and Harvisptokhm started becoming corrupted. To purify it, the [[Khvarena]] [[Simurgh]], which [[Nabu Malikata]] left in Rukkhadevata's care for this very moment, drank from the Amrita before bursting into countless Khvarena, which became the [[Pari]].

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{Lang|{{w|Amrita}}|sa=अमृत}} is a Sanskrit word meaning "immortality" and is a central concept in Indian religions, often referred to in ancient Indian texts as an elixir.
