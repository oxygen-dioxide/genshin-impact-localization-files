==Trivia==
*The [[Ruin Scout]]s and the Hilichurl group led by the Hydro Samachurl will change positions every day through a series of three days:
**On the first day, the Hilichurl group will be at the outskirts of the ruins with the scouts in dormant state near the tree.
**On the second day, the Hilichurl group will be near the scouts from the previous day, while the scouts themselves move a bit further from the tree.
**On the third day, the Hilichurl group will be up on the large ruins while the scouts are active and run in a triangular formation.

===Etymology===
* The name may be derived from {{Lang|mini=1|ain=チラィ|ain_rm=ciray}}, one of the Ainu words for {{w|Sakhalin taimen|''Parahucho perryi''}}, also called the Sakhalin taimen, Japanese huchen, or stringfish.
** Ciray is said to be the name of a fish monster in an Ainu folktale, which was eventually slain with a harpoon by Kanna-kamuy.<ref>Manga Nippon Mukashi-banashi Database: [http://nihon.syoukoukai.com/modules/stories/index.php?lid=54 Monster Fish of the Lake] (Japanese)</ref>
