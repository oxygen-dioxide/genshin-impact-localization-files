{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Save the merchant on the road outside the warehouse, optional)
:'''Strange Merchant:''' Thank you so much, I am so grateful! Haiyaa, the entire cargo would've been lost without you!
:'''Strange Merchant:''' I don't have much money on me, but please, take this as your reward. Don't be shy.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, you're too kind!
:'''Strange Merchant:''' This is farewell then. I hope we'll meet again!

;(Read the Warehouse Notice, optional)
:'''Warehouse Notice:''' ...
:'''Warehouse Notice:''' ...This cave is being used as a temporary warehouse. Please do not store any items here unless they are of great mercantile value!
:'''Warehouse Notice:''' ...
:'''Warehouse Notice:''' ...Qiaoying Village has been busy trying to resolve its tea leaf problem lately. The number of villagers guarding the ruins has been greatly reduced. We can store the antiques we've been digging up here and transport them under the guise of being "tea leaf products."
:'''Warehouse Notice:''' ...
:'''Warehouse Notice:''' ...Tusheng discovered a merchant with some Sumpter Beasts. Perhaps we could use them to transport our goods...
:'''Warehouse Notice:''' ...Important: Do not hit the <abbr title="Refers to the Ruin Machine">big iron lump</abbr> in the depths of the cave!

;(Talk to the Treasure Hoarders guarding the warehouse, optional)
:'''Sitting Tiger:''' Hey, keep off! This is the boss man's turf!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, so mean!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you people?
::'''Coiled Serpent:''' That's up to you. If you're nice, we can be pals. But if you get nosy, we'll have to do something about it.
::'''Sitting Tiger:''' You should grow a brain and go back the way you came!
:{{DIcon}} Who is this "boss man" you speak of?
::'''Sitting Tiger:''' Who is the "boss man"...? Ha! If I told you, you'd keel over with fright!
::'''Coiled Serpent:''' It's for your own good, pal! Leave well alone what you shouldn't mess with.
:'''Paimon:''' You're so suspicious!
:'''Coiled Serpent:''' Suspicious? Whoa there... We're just the doormen. If anyone's acting suspicious, it's you weirdos poking your heads everywhere!
:'''Sitting Tiger:''' Whatever, we've got nothin' to say to you! Just quit bothering us!

;(Talk to the Treasure Hoarders guarding the warehouse again, optional)
:'''Sitting Tiger:''' You two again!?
:'''Coiled Serpent:''' Stop snooping around, friends. Just pretend you didn't see us, and we'll pretend didn't see you.
:{{DIcon}} What are you guarding?
::'''Coiled Serpent:''' Take a guess what we're paid to do, buddy.
::'''Paimon:''' What!? Why?
::'''Coiled Serpent:''' *Ahem* Cough cough...!
::'''Coiled Serpent:''' (I'll only tell the two of you, so don't tell anyone... C'mon, come closer now...)
::'''Paimon:''' (Sure, Paimon's listening!)
::'''Coiled Serpent:''' It's to get rid of people like you!
::'''Paimon:''' Waaah!
:{{DIcon}} I just heard a weird noise from inside the cave...
::'''Sitting Tiger:''' I farted!
::'''Coiled Serpent:''' Uh... right. He farted.
::'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;So everything's okay then...

----

;(Approach the Ruin Guard blocking the other cave entrance)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... What a gigantic Ruin Guard! Huh? Is that a cave behind it?
:'''Paimon:''' But it's so huge and heavy. How can we move it aside...?

;(Defeat the Ruin Machines north of the other cave entrance)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? It looks like something strange fell onto the ground!

;(Return to the Ruin Guard blocking the entrance)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... If we insert this thingamabob into the slot, we can activate the big guy, right?

;(Submit the {{Item|Ruin Machine Core (Chenyu Vale)|text=Ruin Machine Core}})
:{{Black Screen|You insert the charging core into the rusty slot of the Ruin Guard. The stiff ancient machinery slowly begins to move.}}

;(Enter the cave after defeating the Ruin Guard and fight the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Treasure Hoarder A:''' What's going on? Is it an earthquake!?
:'''Treasure Hoarder B:''' Oh no, not good! Someone's coming! Someone go tell the boss, pronto!
:'''Paimon:''' Ha! These punks had no idea we'd be coming in through here!
:'''Mountain Wang:''' Hey, who goes there? How did you get in here?
:'''Mountain Wang:''' It's no good! Run!

;(Free the Strange Merchant)

;(If the player did not meet the merchant before)
::'''Strange Merchant:''' G&mdash;Great Chivalrous {{MC|m=Hero|f=Heroine}}! Please, spare my life! I'm not with them!
::{{DIcon}} And just who are you!?
::'''Strange Merchant:''' Me!? I'm... Uh... It's a long story...? They stole some stuff, and I was asked by my master to register them and return them, that's all.
::'''Strange Merchant:''' Well, since you drove away all the thieves, and my work here is done, I'll just skedaddle for now, if you don't mind!
::{{DIcon}} A moment...!
::'''Strange Merchant:''' No need, after all, we'll definitely meet again!
::{{Black Screen|The strange merchant quickly exits stage left...}}

;(If the player met the merchant before)
::'''Strange Merchant:''' P&mdash;Please spare me, O magnanimous heroes... Wait, it's you guys!?
::{{DIcon}} It's you!?
::'''Strange Merchant:''' Hey hey, what a coincidence, eh...? Ehehe, why don't you guys go back to what you're doing. Now, if you'll excuse me...
::'''Strange Merchant:''' I suggest you see what valuables they left behind. Oh, don't mind me, I've already made notes of everything.... I'll return everything that needs to be returned.
::{{DIcon}} Wait...!
::'''Strange Merchant:''' No need, after all, we'll definitely meet again!
::{{Black Screen|The strange merchant quickly exits stage left...}}

;(Approach the Treasure Hoarders who were guarding the main entrance from behind)
:'''Sitting Tiger:''' The area inside the cavern is important, and unauthorized personnel are forbidden... huh? How'd you guys manage to come from inside?
