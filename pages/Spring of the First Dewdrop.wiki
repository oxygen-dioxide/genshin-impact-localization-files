==Description==
{{Description|A limpid drop of dew floating amidst the waters of Morte Region. It is different from other pure water bodies, as though it is a conglomeration of even more pure and primordial Elemental Energy.<br>The Natural Philosophers of ancient Fontaine never recorded such a creation, until engineers from the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] began to conduct some scattered research over 400 years ago. Some scholars believe that this pure Ichor was the final legacy [[Egeria]] bequeathed to Fontaine &mdash; but even today, this theory has no reliable evidence to support it.|[[Archive]]}}
