|text      = If you receive this letter, that means I was unable to come back before my birthday and cancel it.

At the time I was writing this letter, I was planning to go investigate some ruins...

Ahem! I know what you're thinking. Oh, maybe she fell into another trap, maybe she got trapped by another mechanism... But if one is too concerned over such trivial risks, they will find themselves unable to make any new contributions!

But I am also one who learns from their experiences. For the sake of safety, I prepared this letter in advance, and the location of the ruins is attached. If something does go wrong, then this time, there will be someone who knows where to find me.

I have a hunch that this time, I'll be able to collect reams of materials, and end up losing track of time... If that does occur, then bring some snacks with you, and come remind me to celebrate my birthday~
