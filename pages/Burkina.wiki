'''Burkina''' was a historical figure from the [[Scions of the Canopy]] in [[Natlan]], and was one of the [[Heroes of Natlan|six warriors]] who joined forces with [[Tenoch]] in a war against the Abyss, alongside his [[Yumkasaurus]] companion [[Kongamato]].<ref name="TS">{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref> He makes his first appearance in a flashback in {{Quest|The Last Turnfire Night}}.

Burkina bore the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name|MLP|'''Malipo'''|bearer=1}}, which has since been inherited in the present-day by [[Kinich]].

==Profile==
Burkina has been shown wielding the [[Polearm]] [[Footprint of the Rainbow]] in battle, and has been known to wield the [[Claymore]] [[Fruitful Hook]].

During one of the many battles with the abyss, an abyss-tainted Kongamato took Burkina's life.

==Story==
When the [[cataclysm]] came to Natlan, Burkina and Kongamato worked together to repel the Abyss invaders. During one battle, Kongamato became severely tainted by Abyssal energy, and in a fit of rage, killed Burkina. Before he died, Burkina passed part of his power and blood to Kongamato. The stories from most of the [[Scions of the Canopy]] instead claim that he fell in battle defending Natlan.
