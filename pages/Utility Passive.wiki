'''Utility Passives''', officially referred to as '''Exploration Talents''',<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqWr7dyJNgLKLO-Zpw9muZ9NnC0TyOpij Collected Miscellany]</ref> are a type of Passive [[Talent]]. Upon obtaining a [[Character]], their Utility Passive is automatically unlocked without requiring any Ascensions. The only exception is the [[Traveler]], who doesn't possess one. These talents usually provide some sort of utility outside of combat.

As these passives have not been officially categorized, the categories on this page are all unofficial and were determined by players based on the similarities between certain Talents.

==Cooking Bonuses==
Characters with a '''cooking bonus''' as their Utility Passive have a chance of obtaining an additional [[dish]] for free when they achieve Perfect Cooking on a specific type of dish.

The cooking bonuses of [[Jean]], [[Diona]], [[Yun Jin]], and [[Nilou]] can trigger even when they cook their respective Special Dishes, resulting in the player receiving an additional Special Dish. The cooking bonuses of [[Hu Tao]] and [[Kamisato Ayato]] also trigger when they cook their respective Special Dish, but the player will instead receive an additional Suspicious Dish.

Talents that mark different types of materials can "stack", resulting in multiple resources being displayed on the mini-map at once. Talents that mark the same type of materials (e.g. [[Qiqi]]'s [[Former Life Memories]] and [[Yanfei]]'s [[Encyclopedic Expertise]]) will not stack.
