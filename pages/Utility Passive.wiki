'''Utility Passives''', officially referred to as '''Exploration Talents''',<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqWr7dyJNgLKLO-Zpw9muZ9NnC0TyOpij Collected Miscellany]</ref> are a type of Passive [[Talents|Talent]]. Upon obtaining a [[Characters|Character]], their Utility Passive is automatically unlocked without requiring any Ascensions. The only exception is the [[Traveler]], who doesn't possess one. These talents usually provide some sort of utility outside of combat.

As these passives have not been officially categorized, the categories on this page are all unofficial and were determined by players based on the similarities between certain Talents.

==Cooking Bonuses==
Characters with a '''cooking bonus''' as their Utility Passive have a chance of obtaining an additional [[dish]] for free when they achieve Perfect Cooking on a specific type of dish.

The cooking bonuses of [[Jean]], [[Diona]], and [[Yun Jin]] can trigger even when they cook their respective Special Dishes, resulting in the player receiving an additional Special Dish. The cooking bonus of [[Hu Tao]] can also trigger when she cooks her Special Dish, but the player will instead receive an additional Suspicious Dish.

==Resource Finding Talents==
Characters with a '''resource finding talent''' as their Utility Passive will display the locations of specific types of resources on the mini-map, one location at a time, with a unique icon. These passives only take effect when the character is in the party, but the character does not need to be alive.

Talents that mark different types of materials can "stack", resulting in multiple resources being displayed on the mini-map at once. Talents that mark the same type of material (e.g. [[Qiqi]]'s [[Former Life Memories]] and [[Yanfei]]'s [[Encyclopedic Expertise]]) will not stack.
