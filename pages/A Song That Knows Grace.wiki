==Trivia==
* The Chinese name of this hangout is a partial quote of the saying {{zh|闻弦歌知雅意|rm=wěn xián'gē zhī yǎyì|tl=[the person who] hears the song plucked on a stringed instrument understands the meaning concealed within.}} The full saying is a description of the ancient Chinese musician {{w|Bo Ya#The story about Zhiyin|Bo Ya}} and his close friendship with Zhong Ziqi, whom Bo Ya considered to be the only person who understood the true meaning behind all of his musical compositions. Bo Ya's story is also referenced in the Chinese name of the weapon [[The Stringless#Etymology|The Stringless]].
