|description     = It is said that "mazd" means "wisdom" in [[Sumeru]], and such delicate "wisdom" is simply irresistible. There is a gentle smile in [[Nahida]]'s eyes: "The sea anemone has helped the little fish and witnessed its growth, so it's only natural for the little fish to give something back."

'''Halvamazd''' is a [[Special Dish|special]] [[food]] item that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Candied Ajilenakh Nut]] with [[Nahida]]. The recipe for Candied Ajilenakh Nut is obtainable from [[Puspa Café]] for 5,000 [[Mora]].

Depending on the quality, Halvamazd increases the party's defense by '''282''' for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].
