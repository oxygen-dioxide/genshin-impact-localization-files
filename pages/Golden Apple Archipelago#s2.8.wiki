==Dialogue==
<!-- The dialogues below happen at various places while exploring the open world. They don't seem to be associated with any quest. It worth it to keep them noted somewhere and this looks the best place. Feel free to move them if they are better fitted somewhere else. -->
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Failed a challenge at Pudding Isle regarding collecting Elemental Particles for the 3rd time)
:'''Paimon:''' Grabbing Elemental Particles floating in mid-air is just way too tough...
:'''Paimon:''' But y'know, Paimon does remember that bridges can appear under floating particles in some situations. Might as well give that a go, huh, (Traveler)?

;(Approach the Geo elemental monuments at Pudding Isle)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, why are these elemental monuments all locked up? Are there others on other mountains?

<!-- This should belong to some quest. -->
;(Talk to Electrohammer Vanguard at Minacious Isle)
:'''Electrohammer Vanguard:''' No, I need to... bring the insignia back to him... I've got to find it...
:{{DIcon}} (We aren't getting through to him...)
:{{DIcon}} (Let's leave him alone for now...)

<!-- This should belong to some quest. -->
;(Talk to Mirror Maiden at Broken Isle)
:'''Mirror Maiden:''' ...I have to get back... I have to get back... He's still there. But my brothers are gone, and their photo...
:{{DIcon}} (We aren't getting through to her...)
:{{DIcon}} (Let's leave her alone for now...)

<!-- This should belong to some quest. -->
;(Talk to Hydrogunner Legionnaire at Broken Isle)
:'''Hydrogunner Legionnaire:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Hey!
:'''Hydrogunner Legionnaire:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} (This is strange...)
:{{DIcon}} (No response...)
