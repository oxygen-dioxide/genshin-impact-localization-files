==Overview==
The name Dodoco means "best friend."<ref name="kleestory" /><ref name="dodocotales">{{Ref/Weapon|Dodoco Tales}}</ref>

According to a story told by Alice, the peace-loving and plaful Dodocos of the Dodo Clan have long lived on the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]].<ref name="dodocotales" /> When a Dodoco is born it "rides the wind and goes off on a big adventure."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Story for You}}</ref> Residents of "Dodoland," which may refer to the Dodo Clan, eat roasted apples with jam.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Dodoco's Dodo Stove}}</ref>

===Kaboomball Kombat===
The event [[Kaboomball Kombat]] also features items named with "Dodo." Players faced off against Dodofortresses and used Dodoguards to reflect Kaboomballs.

Dodofortresses share features with Dodoco, as noted by [[Paimon]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Big Badaboom Battle}}</ref> but like the [[Heartbreak Balloon]], they have narrowed eyes and a red band around the middle with a zigzagging pattern. Dodofortresses are also shown in the namecard [[Celebration: Kaboomball]], which mentions a faraway kingdom called the Grand Alliance where the people could throw Kaboomballs. It is unclear if this is also related to the story of the Dodo Clan and the Golden Apple Archipelago.
