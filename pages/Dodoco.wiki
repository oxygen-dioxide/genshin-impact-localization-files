==Appearance==
Dodoco resembles a white furry rabbit with a teardrop-like, fluffy tail. Moreover, it is attached to a chain which hangs from the side of Klee's backpack.

==Information==

===Kaboomball Kombat===
The event [[Kaboomball Kombat]] also features items named with "Dodo." Players faced off against Dodofortresses and used Dodoguards to reflect Kaboomballs.

Dodofortresses share features with Dodoco, as noted by [[Paimon]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Big Badaboom Battle}}</ref> but like the [[Heartbreak Balloon]], they have narrowed eyes and a red band around the middle with a zigzagging pattern. Dodofortresses are also shown in the namecard [[Celebration: Kaboomball]], which mentions a faraway kingdom called the Grand Alliance where the people could throw Kaboomballs. It is unclear if this is also related to the story of the Dodo Clan and the Golden Apple Archipelago.
