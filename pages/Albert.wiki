==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Albert:''' Sorry! I was just leaving...
:'''Albert:''' Oh, you're not a nun. Can I help?
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Albert:''' Stormterror must have been moved by Barbara-sama's charisma, which returned it to its senses at last!
::'''Albert:''' Barbara-sama's smile is like the dawn that breaks through the darkness. It is the star flashing through the night sky. Even Stormterror cannot withstand her loveliness!
::'''Albert:''' If you cannot understand that, then you're part of the problem. You are not yet sufficiently enlightened!
::'''Albert:''' Yes, this must be the truth! Go Barbara, Go!
:{{DIcon}} Did you just say "Barbara-sama"?
::'''Albert:''' Yes. Is there something you find strange about that?
::'''Albert:''' Barbara-sama lights up my world. She is so adorable, so kind, so pure and innocent...
::'''Albert:''' ...What's that look for? You think I'm making this up?
::'''Albert:''' You, ma'am, need to be baptized in the spirit!
::'''Albert:''' ...By which I mean, you need to witness one of Barbara-sama's live performances!
::'''Albert:''' Do you hear me? You must go and watch her performance! *sigh* You ignorant fool... You wouldn't recognize the grace of the gods if it slapped you in the face!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Albert:''' Nothing, just out for a stroll.
::'''Albert:''' Because this is the closest I can get to Barbara-sama without disrupting her work at the Cathedral!
::'''Albert:''' Can you smell the scent of honey in the air?
::'''Albert:''' ...Um, do you want to join the Barbara Fan Club?
::'''Albert:''' 'Cause if you do, you're in luck &mdash; I actually run it! Whether you want to show your support through fan activities or get up-to-date info on performance arrangements, once you're a member you can always find someone to point you in the right direction.
::'''Albert:''' What do you reckon? Give it some thought!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Albert:''' "Go Barbara, Go!"
::'''Albert:''' Oh, you're still here? I wasn't being a weirdo, I was just practicing the chant we do at performances.

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Albert:''' I hope Barbara-sama will like what we've prepared...
:'''Albert:''' ...*sigh* Traveler, what kind of gift do you think moves people the most?
:{{DIcon}} Flowers?
::'''Albert:''' Flowers... a-as a matter of fact... we at the Barbara Fan Club already have a similar idea.
::'''Albert:''' Sending flowers the old-fashioned way would be too boring, better to come up with something a little more... unique...
:{{DIcon}} A letter?
::'''Albert:''' Not a bad choice, but if it's just an ordinary letter then it'll be forgotten in no time...
::'''Albert:''' Hmm, the content has to be different from a normal letter, we need something unforgettable...
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid I don't know either...
::'''Albert:''' Hmm... I wonder how Barbara-sama will react when she sees our gift...
