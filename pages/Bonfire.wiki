'''Bonfires''' are structures that players can find while exploring [[Teyvat]]. They occasionally form part of puzzles.

When part of a puzzle, lighting them up will cause [[Enemies]] to spawn. Defeating them for the first time will award the player with a [[Chest]].

Unlit bonfires can be lit with any {{Pyro}} attack, including [[Overloaded]] and the activation knockbacks of [[Guide to Afterlife]] and [[Niwabi Fire-Dance]].

Lit bonfires carry 1 [[gauge unit]] of Pyro, and can be snuffed out with 1 unit of {{Hydro}}/{{Electro}} or 2 units of {{Cryo}}/{{Anemo}}/{{Geo}}.
