{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing Return to Days of Winter)
:'''Lily:''' Daddy, what's Mommy doing?
:'''Rudolf:''' Mommy is a sister, she believes in [[Barbatos]], and she helps and guides all the other people who believe in Barbatos, too.
:'''Lily:''' Daddy, who's Papa Toes? Is he a magic man?
:'''Rudolf:''' Barbatos is the God of the Wind. He's a very magical man.
:'''Rudolf:''' The reason why Mommy and Daddy and Lily have such a happy life is because Lord Barbatos is a very nice man and looks after us.
:'''Lily:''' But Daddy, why is [[Viktor|that man over there]] saying nasty things about Papa Toes?
:'''Rudolf:''' Little boys and girls aren't allowed to listen to what the [[Fatui]] men say, alright dear?

;(After completing Return to Days of Winter)
:'''Lily:''' Dadda, will that man come back?
:'''Rudolf:''' I don't think so.
:'''Lily:''' Dadda... Is that Fatooey man really a very, very bad person?
:'''Lily:''' He told me stowies, and he got me lots of food, too...
:'''Lily:''' I don't think that's how bad people are...
:'''Rudolf:''' Lily... Bad people and good people aren't that easy to tell apart.
:'''Rudolf:''' This is... It's complicated. You'll understand when you're older.
:'''Lily:''' Oh...{{Dialogue end}}
