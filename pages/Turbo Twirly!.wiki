'''Turbo Twirly!''' is a Permanent [[Event]] released in [[Version 5.0]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* Permanently available after the Version 5.0 update

===Requirements===
* Complete the [[Archon Quest]] "[[Bedtime Story]]"
* After completing the Archon Quest "[[A New Star Approaches]]," you can use the "[[Quick Start]]" function on the event page to begin the Archon Quest "[[Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn]]" directly.

===Summary===
* Progress through the Archon Quest "[[Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn]]" to invite "Mottled Gold Yet Unsmelted" [[Kachina]] ({{Geo}}).
* You can only invite "Mottled Gold Yet Unsmelted" Kachina (Geo) once while progressing through the Archon Quest "Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn." The event page will close once you have invited the character.
* Before you invite the character, the event page will be available before the [[Version 6.0]] update. After the Version 6.0 update, the event page will close. Then you will no longer be able to use the "Quick Start" function via the event page, but you can still invite "Mottled Gold Yet Unsmelted" Kachina (Geo) while progressing through the Archon Quest "Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn."
