|description  = A type of bait based on flour mixed with the pulp and seeds of [[Bulle Fruit]]. When tossed into the water, it quickly spreads a sweet and sour fragrance that is irresistible to fishes such as Heartfeather Bass. A group of anglers once resorted to eating this bait in an emergency after they had run out of supplies, and were poisoned as a result. To prevent such accidents from happening again, this type of bait was made much sourer than it was before – so sour in fact that simply holding it up to their noses makes people feel dizzy and causes their eyes to stream, let alone putting it in their mouths...<br><br>Suitable for catching [[Heartfeather Bass]].
