:'''Vinesh:''' Welcome to the "Saurian Expedition Supply Station." We're currently guiding the little saurians along on their expedition. Want to join in?
:{{DIcon|Saurian Treasure Seeker}} Guide the little saurians.
:;(Opens [[Tournament of Glory in Bloom/Saurian Treasure Seeker|Saurian Treasure Seeker]] menu)
:{{DIcon}} Have a chit-chat.
::'''Vinesh:''' My brother and I are interns at Mr. [[Ifa]]'s clinic. Although we've only been working there for a short time, every day is fulfilling.
::'''Vinesh:''' Mr. Ifa and Mr. [[Cacucu]] are both amazing. My brother and I would love to become vets beloved by [[saurian]]s, just like them.
::'''Vinesh:''' I especially admire Mr. Cacucu, hehe. Although... he's been picking a concerning number of fights with another [[Ajaw|weird, yellowish little saurian]] lately.
::'''Vinesh:''' That little thing calls itself "Almighty Dragonlord," or something like that. I hope he doesn't become a bad influence on Mr. Cacucu...
:{{DIcon}} Leave.
