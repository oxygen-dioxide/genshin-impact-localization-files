==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nour:''' It might be time to check the durability of the bearings...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Nour:''' I'm a patrolling Gardes member.
::'''Nour:''' More precisely, I accompany the Gardemek on patrol.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Gardemeks...
:::'''Nour:''' They're machines, but they're an indispensable part of the Gardes. We rely upon them for the maintenance of public safety, day in and day out.
:::'''Nour:''' As for me, you can consider me more of an engineer in charge of their maintenance.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Sounds pretty easy.
:::'''Nour:''' It's a lot easier if we don't need to deal with any danger directly.
:::'''Nour:''' In turn, the maintenance and upkeep of Gardemeks must be practiced every day.
:::'''Nour:''' As long as I keep a Gardemek in good condition, it will be able to protect others. Simple, isn't it?
:::;Obtain {{Item|Adventurer's Experience|x=4}}.
::{{DIcon}} That dog is a machine?
:::'''Nour:''' Huh? Oh, no, no, I'm referring to that big machine over there in the distance, not this little cutie.
:::'''Nour:''' Of course, it's also of great assistance to us Gardes. Guard Poodles can do a great many things &mdash; neither man nor Mek can replace them.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Nour:''' It's fine.
