The '''Missing Miners''' are a group of quest-exclusive [[NPCs]] that appear in Act II of the [[Historia Antiqua Chapter]]. Their names respectively are Long, Bold Cen, Brave Cen, and Mao.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Truth in the Stones}}</ref> The disappearance of them is a mystery which needs to be solved in this whole Act.

==Profile==
While the miners were working at [[The Chasm]], they were hypnotized by [[Jiu]] and led to the [[Dragon-Queller]], where they were forced to dig to break the seal on [[Azhdaha]]. Forced to work to the point of exhaustion, Mao, one of the four miners, ran out of the cave near the Dragon-Queller and fainted nearby. Fortunately, the [[Traveler]], [[Zhongli]] and [[Kun Jun]] found him. After taking him to a tent to rest, they continued onward and immediately discovered the remaining three miners, who attacked them; however, Zhongli protected the group from the miners' attacks until Jiu appeared to forcibly take them to Azhdaha. After Azhdaha was defeated and sealed again, all four workers were brought back safely to [[Liyue Harbor]] by [[Uncle Dai]].
