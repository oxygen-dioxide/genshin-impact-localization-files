'''Photo Mode''' is a system in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that allows the player to take photos of their [[characters]] and the surrounding environment. It can be accessed from the [[Paimon Menu]] by default upon starting the game.

However, neither Photo Mode nor the [[Kamera]] gadget can capture images nor record video inside [[Domains]]. The player must use an external screenshot or screen recording utility. Photo Mode also cannot capture images during combat, but the Kamera may be used instead.
