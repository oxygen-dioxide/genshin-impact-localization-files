==Trivia==
*Prior to [[Version 2.0]], this Event Wish along with [[Gentry of Hermitage]] were the Event Wishes that have a new 4 Star character featured, specifically [[Diona]], [[Rosaria]] and [[Xinyan]], [[Yanfei]].
*In the first and second runs of this Event Wish, both newly featured 4 Stars were from [[Mondstadt]] and wield {{Cryo}} [[Vision]]s.
*The name of the event may be a reference to "{{w|Farewell of Slavianka}}", a famous Russian patriotic march.
*The third run of this Event Wish series uses the same 4 Stars from [[Kamisato Ayaka]]'s Event Wish, [[The Heron's Court/2021-07-21|The Heron's Court]], namely [[Chongyun]], [[Yanfei]] and [[Ningguang]].
