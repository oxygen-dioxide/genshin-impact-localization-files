:'''Tano:''' That timbre sounds pretty good! I'm assuming his turntabling skills have become even better?
:'''Pochtli:''' His turntabling skills have always been pretty good, but this time, I think the credit has got to go to the new record-pressing technique.
:'''Tano:''' Ohh, you mean what we talked about last time regarding the new [[Liquid Phlogiston|liquid phlogiston]] method! You've already managed to make it work?
:'''Pochtli:''' Of course! Don't underestimate me.
:'''Tano:''' Oh, never! I'm just really happy for you.
:'''Pochtli:''' It's still in the experimental phase. I'm still gathering feedback even as I watch the show.
:'''Pochtli:''' Hmm... Sounds like it's pretty difficult to control the movement of the record when you're trying to scratch it...
:'''Pochtli:''' Seems like there's still room for improvement.
