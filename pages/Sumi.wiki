==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sumi:''' Hey there, are you looking for me?
:'''Sumi:''' You can talk to [[Yuuzou]] if it's work-related.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Sumi:''' I used to work at Tatarasuna. Yuuzou rescued me from the ruins after the disaster &mdash; straight up saved my life.
::'''Sumi:''' I have no obligations to [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya]] and can leave here at any time. But I've been through life-and-death situations with everyone here... I won't be separated from them again.
::{{DIcon}} About your companion...
::'''Sumi:''' Though the resistance is definitely involved with the incident at the [[Mikage Furnace]] in some way, the Shogunate's policies are still way too harsh.
::'''Sumi:''' I know the difficulties Vision-bearers face. I've taken some in before, after all.
::'''Sumi:''' All in all, I don't particularly support either side, but I've chosen to stay here because of my companions.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sumi:''' Okay, goodbye.
