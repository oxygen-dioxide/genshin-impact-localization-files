:'''Chambelland:''' Hey, Boss, need a navigator? I'm your man!
:{{DIcon}} You're the navigator here?
::'''Chambelland:''' I am... or was, rather, the best navigator in [[Lumidouce Harbor]]. I know these waters like the back of my hand.
::'''Chambelland:''' I can help you bring in even a tiny raft into the harbor without capsizing.
::{{DIcon}} You used to be...?
::'''Chambelland:''' Um... Ahem! I'd say the future of those working in Lumidouce Harbor isn't very bright. It's practically a black hole for career progression, and the pay is lousy. It's better to strike out on your own.

:::'''Chambelland:''' Boss, if you hire me, I... I could help you make some connections. I know [[Chaussivert]], and with his protection, there ain't nobody in the world who would dare lay a finger on your cargo.

:::'''Chambelland:''' Wait a minute, you're...! Oh my goodness! It's an honor to see you here. I've heard Mr. Chaussivert talk about you. You're truly exceptional!
:::'''Chambelland:''' If you decide to hire me for the job, I'll give you a... let's say, 20% discount!
::'''Chambelland:''' Why don't you think it over? If you ever decide to hire me, you know where to find me.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Chambelland:''' Goodbye! If you want to hire me, you know where to find me.
