The '''Elemental Burst''' &mdash; or '''Burst''' for short &mdash; is a [[Talent]] that requires [[Energy]] to use and is usually more powerful than the [[Elemental Skill]]. In community circles, it is sometimes referred to as an "'''Ultimate'''" ("'''Ult'''" for short) or {{key|Q}} (reference to the corresponding default hotkey on PC).

Elemental Bursts grant a varying number of [[Invincibility Frames]] upon casting, during its duration where the character is immune to damage. For the duration of these i-frames, the HP bar locks, effectively preventing any forms of damage from enemies or debuffs for at least a few seconds, depending on the character.

==Overview==
Every [[character]] has the talent associated with the Elemental Burst unlocked by default. In order for it to be used, it is required to fulfill two conditions:
# Just like with the Elemental Skill, the Burst must not be on cooldown. When it is on cooldown, the Elemental Burst icon on the HUD located at the bottom-right side of the screen will show how much time it takes for it to be ready again, similar to Elemental Skills.
# The character must have gathered as much energy as the Burst's Energy Cost indicates. The Energy collected since the last time the Burst was used by the on-field character is reflected in the Elemental Burst icon as it fills with the character's element's color. Excess Energy is not taken into account.

Whenever both conditions are fulfilled, the Elemental Burst icon will glow and an audio cue will play, indicating that it is ready to be used. When a character off field has their Burst ready, the icon will appear next to their portrait and life bar. On certain mobile versions, this icon is replaced by a checkmark of the same color. The same checkmark will appear below other players' names in co-op and in the sidebar. After using an Elemental Burst, all Energy will be consumed and the skill will enter a short cooldown (Energy can still be gathered while in cooldown).

==Trivia==
* [[Barbara]] is the only 4-star character to have an Elemental Burst animation like those of 5-star characters. It is also the only burst that deals neither buff nor damage.
* [[Tartaglia]] is the only 5-star character to have an Elemental Burst with two distinct versions: One can be performed while in Ranged Stance, and the other can be performed while in Melee Stance. Unlike other Elemental Bursts with behavior that varies based on certain conditions<!-- Albedo, Alhaitham, Hu Tao, Kuki Shinobu, Ningguang, Yae Miko -->, the two versions of Tartaglia's Elemental Burst have separate animations, voice-overs, and targeting logic<!-- is this the right term? -->.
** [[Wanderer]] also has separate voice-overs for his Elemental Burst based on whether he is in the Windfavored State or not at the time of casting, and he is the only other character to have Elemental Burst voice-overs that depend on certain conditions. However, the Elemental Burst itself is unchanged.
* The [[Traveler]] is the only 5-star character to have Elemental Burst animations like those of 4-star characters.
