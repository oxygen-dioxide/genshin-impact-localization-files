{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jiawei:''' Hmm. I made my wife some [[Squirrel Fish]] yesterday... How about some [[Black-Back Perch Stew]] today, then?
;(After completing [[Exploding Population]])
:{{DIcon|Fishing Supplies}} I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
::'''Jiawei:''' Ah, so you're a hobbyist too, are you? Well, have a look. I sell nothing but the best!
:;(Opens the [[Liyue Fishing Association]] shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Jiawei:''' Ah, how do you do? My name's Jiawei.
::'''Jiawei:''' As you can see, I'm a fisherman... An elite one at that.
::'''Jiawei:''' I know I just look like some guy staring out into space here at the harbor, but back in the day, I was a seafaring, legendary-fish-catching professional!
::'''Jiawei:''' As for now, well, you've got to stay grounded, you know? A lifetime of adventure on the waves, with your family worrying about you day in and day out... That's no way to keep living forever.
::'''Jiawei:''' Wouldn't you agree?
:{{DIcon}} So, what are you doing?
::'''Jiawei:''' I'm preparing ingredients, of course, haha!
::'''Jiawei:''' My wife really loves eating fish and is always hankering after something made from a fresh catch of mine. That's just how it is, you know?
::'''Jiawei:''' The good news is that I'm a dab hand and then some at fishing. After all, I am an elite fisherman &mdash; I even once put out to sea to catch a fish of legendary size back in the day.
::'''Jiawei:''' That was before I met her, of course, and I'm not going to delve into ancient history. Did you need something from me?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Jiawei:''' See you! May your catches ever swell in size.
