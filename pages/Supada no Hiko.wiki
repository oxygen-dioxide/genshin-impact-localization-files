'''Supada no Hiko''', also known as '''Spartacus''',<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2}}</ref> is an quest-exclusive NPC in [[Enkanomiya]] that appears during the [[World Quest]] ''[[Lotus Eater]]''.

==Profile==
Spartacus was the leader of a resistance against the [[Sunchildren]] and the nobles that controlled Byakuyakoku. However, he was captured by the [[Sunchildren]] and imprisoned within [[The Altar at The Serpent's Heart]], where he eventually died. Due to the nature of the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], his shade remained long after his death and would be discovered by the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] thousands of years later.

Spartacus was initially relieved to see someone but realized the Traveler was not a member of the resistance. He wanted them to relay a message to his comrades, but he had forgotten his name and the phrase needed. After being informed of his name, he began to gradually remember everything and asked them to inform his comrades to continue fighting the nobility. The Traveler arrived at the location and met [[Adonis]], who told them that after Spartacus' capture, the resistance collapsed. To try to get back on their feet, they tried selling [[Dragonbone Orb]]s. This earned them good money, but the placating effects of the Orbs also caused the resistance members to lose their will to fight, resulting in their ultimate disbandment. Adonis lamented that if Spartacus had been around, he would have stopped it from the start.

===Appearance===
Like most [[Shades of Tokoyo|shades]], Spartacus is a translucent humanoid figure without defining physical features.
