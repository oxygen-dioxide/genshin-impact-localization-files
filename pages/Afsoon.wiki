==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Afsoon:''' Why can't [[Xing Cheng|he]] understand? It already takes so much time to enter and exit the port, and we just have to wait?
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
::'''Afsoon:''' Don't even bring that up. I can't stand that captain. Every time he comes to unload his cargo, it takes several times longer than any other ship.
::'''Afsoon:''' He keeps saying that tea is fragile cargo that must be handled delicately, and that it naturally takes more time.
::'''Afsoon:''' If taking so much time is really on the up and up, then why did he feel the need to secretly hand out some tea to the port officials? Hmph...
::'''Afsoon:''' Next time, I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind!
::{{DIcon}} And just how do you plan on doing that?
::'''Afsoon:''' I... uh... I have to bring more spices!
::'''Afsoon:''' He claims I don't understand tea, but what does he know about spices? We'll see whose goods sell better.
:{{DIcon}} B&mdash;Bye!
::'''Afsoon:''' How can you reason with someone like that?
