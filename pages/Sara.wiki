==Trivia==
* She decided she wanted to import [[Jueyun Chili]] peppers from [[Liyue]] for local resale. However, [[Vile]] thinks this would not be a sound business decision, as the peppers are supposedly extremely hot and "86%" of locals wouldn't want them. Vile is considering sending [[Kaeya]] to talk to Sara after having failed to convince her otherwise herself.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Vile}}</ref>
