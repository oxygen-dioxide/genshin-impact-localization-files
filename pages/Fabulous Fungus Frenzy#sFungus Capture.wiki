==Fungus Capture==
;Capture Zone Map Description
{{Description|The zone charted by the organizer of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament. It is believed that the Fungi inhabiting here match up well with Wisdom Orbs. Therefore, even the most basic type of Wisdom Orbs alone should suffice to capture and tame them.}}

|{{Card|Floating Hydro Fungus|link=Floating Hydro Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|Huh... Didn't we meet this sort of Fungus a long while back? Well, let's make sure to give it a nice name!
* Bongo-Head
** Paimon remembers an idea she had from before! Let's call this one Bongo-Head!
* Bongo-Head
** Bing bong, bing bong... Oh! How does Bongo-Head sound?
* Bongo-Head
** Hmm... No matter how Paimon thinks about this, Bongo-Head seems to be the right name for it!
|-
|{{Card|Stretchy Electro Fungus|link=Stretchy Electro Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|This Fungus is super tall and can use Electro. Now, what shall we call it...?
* Eledrill
** Hmm... How about Eledrill? If only its cap could be stiffer...
* Tingleshroom
** That cap looks so familiar... Paimon knows, let's call it Tingleshroom!
* Stormlord
** This Fungi reminds Paimon of some strong hilichurls who can also wield the power of Electro... Paimon's gonna name it Stormlord!
|-
|rowspan=2 | II
|{{Card|Stretchy Geo Fungus|link=Stretchy Geo Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|This Fungus has such a big head, but it's more agile than it looks! Let's give it a unique name, shall we?
* Stoutwaist
** That must be a strong waist to withstand such a large upper body... Let's go with Stoutwaist!
* Hardhat
** Even this heavy head can't hurt its speed. The name Hardhat suits it well!
* Crasherbasher
** The way it moves makes Crasherbasher a perfect name for it! Don't you think?
|-
|{{Card|Whirling Cryo Fungus|link=Whirling Cryo Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|This sort's pretty hard to catch, huh? Let's figure out what to call it, shall we?
* Pickinding
** It's full of spikes... It's probably gonna make some loud noises if it touches anything. Why don't we call it Pickinding?
* Coolshroom
** Paimon's all sweaty now after following it this far... Let's just call it Coolshroom.
* Coolit
** Paimon's heard that names can be warnings as well. Maybe we can go with Coolit?
|-
|rowspan=2 | III
|{{Card|Floating Dendro Fungus|link=Floating Dendro Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|Now this is a pretty ordinary-looking Fungus, but let's give it a nice name all the same!
* Greenhead
** Its color is the closest to that of grass and trees among all Fungi. Paimon names it... Greenhead!
* Floatwell
** Paimon has heard some stories about it, but it's been behaving itself so far, so Paimon's gonna call it Floatwell!
* Bloomsoon
** Plants that bloom and bear fruits seem to be important, so how about Bloomsoon?
|-
|{{Card|Stretchy Pyro Fungus|link=Stretchy Pyro Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|This is also a Pyro Fungus, but it's super long. Let Paimon think...
* Pyrotechpuff
** Those wielding the power of Pyro all have flashy skills that look like fireworks. And so... this is Pyrotechpuff!
* Blazesword
** Paimon thinks that if you grab its body and wield it as a sword, you'd be unstoppable! Well, Blazesword sounds about right!
* Sparksnspores
** If it can release fireballs, Sparksnspores would be a pretty fitting name! If not, it's a pretty good name, anyway.
|-
|rowspan=2 | IV
|{{Card|Floating Anemo Fungus|link=Floating Anemo Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|Ooh, this one's just like Twirly-Whirly! Paimon's got a new idea coming on...
* Shroomterror
** Shroomterror it is! Paimon would like to make a hat of its shape and gift it to someone in Mondstadt!
* Superswirl
** Do you think this one can blow itself away if the wind it unleashes is too strong? That would really be a Superswirl!
* Stormicorn
** Layla has already come up with some cute names, so we'd better use some powerful-sounding ones. How does Stormicorn sound?
|-
|{{Card|Whirling Pyro Fungus|link=Whirling Pyro Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|Huh, isn't this guy pretty similar to [[Haniyyah]]'s Pyro-1? Let's be sure to give it a cool-sounding name!
* Retribushroom
** Hmm... How about Retribushroom? Oh... Paimon's hoping this won't threaten our ability to order grape juice ever again...
* Flamewrath
** Speaking of might, the name Flamewrath sure belongs to someone mighty!
* Firepunch
** It looks like a fighter already! How about Firepunch? Hmm, might be a little strange though...
|-
|rowspan=2 | V
|{{Card|Whirling Electro Fungus|link=Whirling Electro Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|This Fungus is really dangerous. It even leaves Electro behind when it runs off. What should we call it...
* Sparkdart
** This one makes super loud noises! Perhaps we can call it Sparkdart.
* Ringthunder
** It moves in circles, so maybe sometimes even in an arc. So of course we're gonna call it Ringthunder!
* Elebit
** It somehow reminds Paimon of a tool used by miners. Oh, Paimon gets it! Let's call it Elebit!
|-
|{{Card|Stretchy Anemo Fungus|link=Stretchy Anemo Fungus/Fabulous Fungus Frenzy|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}
|A jumpy Fungus that uses Anemo... Feels kinda familiar, don't you think?
* Windyhead
** Hmm... Paimon suddenly lost her train of thought... Now Paimon's head's feeling so hollow that the wind could blow right through it... Uh, let's just call this one Windyhead, shall we...
* Skillshroom
** It's rather skillful, so how about... Skillshroom?
* Boundstrider
** Hey, the way it bounces is as if it could step on the wind! Let's call it Boundstrider. How about that?
