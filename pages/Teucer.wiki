==Profile==
Teucer is a young boy from [[Snezhnaya]] and the younger brother of [[Tartaglia]], [[Tonia]] and [[Anthon]].<ref name="JP CV tweet" />

After learning of the [[Traveler]] through Tartaglia's letters (and feeling lonely without him), Teucer took a boat from Snezhnaya to Liyue to look for him. Teucer somehow managed to wander out of the harbor and into [[Lingju Pass]] where he encountered a massive "[[Ruin Guard|Mr. Cyclops]]", which the Traveler ran into and destroyed. Upon learning of the situation from him, they brought him to [[Northland Bank]] where he reunited with his older brother. Childe, not wanting to let Teucer know of his relationship with the Fatui, asked the Traveler to help babysit him, but Teucer quickly grew bored, wanting to see his brother at work. Following two awkward run-ins with Childe, he promised to leave when he saw Liyue's "Institute for Toy Research", a facility that [[Il Dottore]] had abandoned. When the visit concluded, Teucer took the boat back to Snezhnaya.

===Personality===
On account of Teucer's young age, Tartaglia dotes on him and tries his best to keep him out of Snezhnaya's "darker side." As a result, Teucer is sometimes incredibly naïve about the world &mdash; believing Ruin Guards to be his friends, calling them "Mr. Cyclopses", and growing angry at anyone who attempts to tell him that they are dangerous machines. He also hands a huge sum of Mora to the Traveler because he was taught that, if he gave it to a "nice person", they would "take good care of Teucer". He is particularly picky with what he eats, preferring overly sweet foods cooked in extra virgin olive oil and cannot tolerate spicy foods.

Teucer is, if nothing else, rather brave &mdash; he made it all the way to Liyue as an accidental stowaway and even managed to wander the country while having no combat skills and only some bags of Mora on hand.

===Appearance===
Teucer is a young boy with pale, freckled skin, blue eyes, and orange hair, strongly resembling his older brother. He is seen wearing what is likely traditional Snezhnayan clothes, including a brown and white bomber hat.
