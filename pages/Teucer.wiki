==Profile==
Teucer is a young boy from [[Snezhnaya]] and the younger brother of [[Tartaglia]], [[Tonia]] and [[Anthon]].<ref name="JP CV tweet" />

After learning of the [[Traveler]] through Tartaglia's letters (and feeling lonely without him), Teucer took a boat from Snezhnaya to Liyue to look for him. Teucer somehow managed to wander out of the harbor and into [[Lingju Pass]] where he encountered a massive "[[Ruin Guard|Mr. Cyclops]]", which the Traveler ran into and destroyed. Upon learning of the situation from him, they brought him to [[Northland Bank]] where he reunited with his older brother. Childe, not wanting to let Teucer know of his relationship with the Fatui, asked the Traveler to help babysit him, but Teucer quickly grew bored, wanting to see his brother at work. Following two awkward run-ins with Childe, he promised to leave when he saw Liyue's "Institute for Toy Research", a facility that [[Il Dottore]] had abandoned. When the visit concluded, Teucer took the boat back to Snezhnaya.

===Appearance===
Teucer is a young boy with pale, freckled skin, blue eyes, and orange hair, strongly resembling his older brother. He is seen wearing what is likely traditional Snezhnayan clothes, including a brown and white bomber hat.
