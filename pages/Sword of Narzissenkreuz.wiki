==Description==
Travels are full of meetings and partings.<br>
Perhaps the only trusty and inseparable companions of a Traveler,<br>
Are the sword in their hand and the dream in their heart.

Before growing old, the eternal Traveler shall pass through many worlds.<br>
Leaving behind naught but stories beyond count and a slightly brighter future.

==Lore==
The Sword of Narzissenkreuz was a ceremonial sword used by the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]] in a ritual to separate the mind from the body. It has been notably used by [[Narzissenkreuz]] himself to grant a certain hilichurl intelligence by those means. The sword's very existence can be considered a hypothetical "vision," in that its constituent elements are based entirely on ancient philosophies concerning the soul. Through unknown means, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo was able to recreate these elements of the soul in the material world - these "elements" being Memory, Wish, Soul and Persona (each of which was sealed in their respective Orthant). The fusion of these elements is "reason" to the Ordo, and it can henceforth cut or unite any "will of water." According to [[Caterpillar]], the Sword of Narzissenkreuz can also be any object that holds "reason."
