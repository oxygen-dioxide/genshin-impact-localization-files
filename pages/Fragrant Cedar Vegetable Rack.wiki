|description    = A tall stack of shelves built from Fragrant Cedar. This shelf rack can store a great number of items, and is typically found in kitchens of busy inns and restaurants as well as the estates of wealthy families.<br />Each shelf can bear a good amount of weight, but firsthand user experience suggests it is not wise to put large items on the very top shelf. Especially not, say, a full-bellied [[Guoba]].

==Trivia==
* At release, the Fragrant Cedar Vegetable Rack could not be found in the indoor furnishing screen. There was a work-around to place the vegetable rack as an independent indoor furnishing by placing the [[Busy Kitchen]] Furnishing Set and retrieving any one of the furnishings to break up the set. Then the Fragrant Cedar Vegetable Rack becomes an independent indoor furnishing that could be freely adjusted in the area. Using the Busy Kitchen set requires the [[Wide Stone Stove]], which was only available from the [[Battle Pass/Realm of Diversion|Realm of Diversion]] Battle Pass: Gnostic Chorus.
