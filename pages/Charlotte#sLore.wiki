{{Quote|...Euphrasie, three days ago, one of your journalists secretly followed a suspect all the way from the Court of Fontaine to Romaritime Harbor, and almost ended up being tied up and thrown into the sea by a gang of criminals. Whether or not there's any truth in the notion that 'nearer to the action is closer to the truth,' surely Miss Charlotte doesn't value her reports more than she does her own life?|Yet another exasperated exchange between Captain [[Chevreuse]] of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol and [[Euphrasie]], Editor-in-Chief of The Steambird}}
Fontaine's famous newspaper The Steambird has a veritable legion of reporters it can call upon, each with their own area of expertise. Some specialize in celebrity gossip, others follow the word on the street, while others still focus on political affairs...

But among them all, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest thanks to her seemingly boundless reserve of energy and perseverance &mdash; the inimitable Charlotte.

Unswervingly committed to the principle that "nearer to the action is closer to the truth," Charlotte has a habit of popping up literally anywhere and everywhere in Fontaine &mdash; from its widest avenues to its narrowest back alleys, its highest vantage points to its lowest subterranean vaults, even its tallest mountains to its deepest undersea caverns. She captures the "truth" with her Kamera, records it in her articles, and finally unveils it for all to see.

And when the "truth" comes out, she's met with a variety of different reactions ranging from applause, to embarrassment, to outright fury. There are even some who would resort to any means necessary to make a particular article connected to themselves disappear. Or alternatively, just make Charlotte disappear.

For this reason, the newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie has on numerous occasions felt the need to distance Charlotte from the Court of Fontaine by sending her off on faraway "field reporting" jobs, only recalling her once the [[Maison Gardiennage]] or Special Security and Surveillance Patrol had finally managed to clear things up.

But despite all this, neither the toil of the job itself nor the pressure of external denunciations and threats has ever {{sic|phased}} Charlotte in the slightest.

With her trusty companion Monsieur Verite by her side, she invariably carries out her journalistic duties with unfaltering fervor, rushing about in pursuit of all the "truths" out there just waiting to be discovered.

              --><p>For example, [[Romaritime Harbor]] might suddenly swell with new ships, crewed by sailors of obviously non-Fontainian origin. Some fishmonger in [[Poisson]] might suddenly buy three months' worth of fish in a single month, or countless flyers boasting of a certain place where especially delicious fish can be found might suddenly appear in the Court...</p><!--
              --><p>In the eyes of a mediocre reporter or ordinary city folk, these are "independent" tales, just like there will always be waves rippling across the sea's surface &mdash; such ordinary events are barely worth paying attention to at all.</p><!--

              --><p>The first [[Rainbow Rose]] that bloomed in the yard come spring, exceeding all others in vibrance. The children gladly padding about in puddles on the leaf-strewn streets after a storm and their hapless laughing families. The beauty of a solitary shell on the seashore, and the tiny crab surveying the world from underneath. The [[Blubber Profiterole]] she had with her family on her birthday, and the ever-so-slightly-too-deep color of the cream...</p><!--
              --><p>To most, a flower is a flower, a shell is a shell, and a Profiterole is still a Profiterole even if it is a bit too sweet &mdash; that's just how the world is.</p><!--

              --><p>Charlotte's father, a seasoned reporter and professional nature photographer, noticed his daughter's interest in and knack for "observation."

              --><p>"Not all people are attentive enough to seek out and observe subtle differences, but this, Charlotte, is your unique talent."</p><!--
              --><p>Those were the words of her father, the "Reporter of the Idylls," Galanopoulo.</p><!--
              --><p>From then on, there was a little junior reporter by the senior reporter's side. This father-daughter tag team could be found on streets wide and narrow, forests and rivers alike, raising two Kameras, one large and one small, taking countless still images of moving beauty.</p><!--
              --><p>Even though their "interviews" always caused the gentle yet strict Mrs. Gagnepetit to nag them incessantly, Charlotte's laughter never failed to be the quickest way to make her mother stop. And as for her soiled clothes and dirtied hat, those were left to the ever-capable Mr. Galanopoulo.</p><!--
              --><p>To her, the whole world is a giant treasure trove.</p><!--

              --><p>With her consent, he sent the photos they'd taken to The Steambird. The editors were quickly taken with their photos &mdash; especially Charlotte's &mdash; and profusely praised Galanopoulo's ever-improving photography skills, reserving, just as before, prime placement for them in their publication.</p><!--
              --><p>Those pictures caused quite the stir when they were published, with critics stumbling over each other to flatter them, and newspaper hobbyists fighting to get copies to make their clipping collections yet more colorful and vivid.</p><!--

              --><p>The veteran reporter lightly pushed Charlotte forward, saying calmly: "Ah, such pictures are beyond me. It's all my daughter's handiwork!"</p><!--
              --><p>The experienced, learned ladies and gentlemen who had come knocking could not but fall silent first, before expressing surprise, and then beginning to whisper amongst themselves and even venturing a few questions.</p><!--
              --><p>Charlotte blinked. The bewildered adults before her seemed every bit like little insects searching for shelter in a storm, waving their antennae this way and that, crying "Where are the leaves? Where are the leaves?"</p><!--

              --><p>The young child's cry caused them to collectively leap out of their worn skins, and everyone turned to look, only to be greeted by a custom-made Kamera and the click of a shutter.</p><!--

              --><p>Euphrasie was straightforward about her intent. She hoped that Charlotte would agree to become a "special correspondent" &mdash; someone who would conduct interviews and write articles in addition to taking photographs.</p><!--

              --><p>Her parents responded with silence, for they knew that their daughter had already made her choice. Charlotte was old enough, and all birds are destined to spread their wings and leave the nest someday.</p><!--
              --><p>The next morning, Euphrasie went to work as usual, and there, waiting for her at the entrance to The Steambird, she saw Charlotte, ready with her Kamera and notepad.</p><!--

              --><p>Charlotte's articles swept through the Fontainian media world like a tidal wave, and in response to public outcry, the Maison Gardiennage declared an official inquiry into the Award, suspending its activities and investigating all suspicious awardees.</p><!--

The chubby-faced man did not seem keen on speaking the truth, and indeed was only interested in answering any questions insofar as he might redirect them. The divers he employed, too, proved quite tight-lipped.</p><!--

They were in a titanic undersea rift, a place where it was completely forbidden to work according to Fontainian diving regulations.</p><!--

              --><p>Scrutinizing it, all she could manage was to mumble a few words:</p><!--
