{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Roialte:''' Work done without error is work well done.
:{{DIcon}} Is everything going smoothly?
::'''Roialte:''' Thanks to you, other than the occasional racket the Autostamper 3000 makes, everything else is going quite alright.
::'''Roialte:''' It's quieter when Mr. [[Thales]] isn't around, really, like a dog tied to a post in front of a cafe.
::'''Roialte:''' You see, even the most energetic little creatures know that a little rest will allow one to run further the next day.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Work-life balance, I get it...
:::'''Roialte:''' Well said. It could be a motto.
:::'''Roialte:''' Cornelia just brought some refreshments, please be my guest and have some.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Conch Madeleine|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Roialte:''' Take care.
{{Dialogue End}}
===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Roialte:''' The day is so lively with the youngsters around and the night seems ever more quiet by comparison.
:{{DIcon}} Good evening.
::'''Roialte:''' Good evening, Traveler. Seems like you've had a rather busy day yourself, hmm? Just like Mr. [[Iaune]].
::'''Roialte:''' You do seem a lot happier than he does, though.
::'''Roialte:''' He's too passionate, and that exhausts him. This is quite common in the young, and they'll need some time to adjust.
::'''Roialte:''' Don't worry, [[Semaine]] and I will keep an eye on him.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Roialte:''' See you, then. Tomorrow will be another lovely day.
