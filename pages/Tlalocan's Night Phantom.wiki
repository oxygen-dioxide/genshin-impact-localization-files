==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Chasca wears a brown cowboy hat with golden accents shaped like a bird's beak and eyes. The brim is decorated with blue and red feathers, and an ornament with dangling orange and white feathers hangs from the underbrim.

She sports a blue and golden earring on her right ear, along with a black, sleeveless, form-fitting crop top. The top features intricate golden detailing and cutouts along the center. Two fabric pieces extend from opposite sides, forming blue and red cloak-like elements that flow down to her calves. The back of the top is split, held together by more golden detailing, from which an orange feather dangles.

On her right arm, she wears a black glove, while her left arm is adorned with a tight, detached sleeve that extends to her left hand, resembling an archer's glove. A golden bracelet rests on her left wrist.

She dons a red scarf attached to it a cape-like element with feathered tassels that drapes across the right parts of her back. A brown belt, with her {{Anemo}} [[Vision]] hanging from the left side, supports various ornaments that reach down to her knee. She wears tight black leggings, with one side stopping at the hips and the other extending to full length, paired with black heeled boots.
