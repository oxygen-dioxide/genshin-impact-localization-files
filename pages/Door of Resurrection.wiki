'''Doors of Resurrection''' are revival portals found in certain [[Domains]]. If a player falls in combat, they will revive at the nearest active Door of Resurrection. If a player enters an out-of-bounds area, they will also revive at the nearest active Door of Resurrection, at the cost of a small portion of the party's HP.

They are automatically activated by walking close to them. Once active, they glow green. Sometimes they are hidden, but they serve the same purpose.

==Notable Doors of Resurrection==
* On the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]] during [[Version 1.6]], a Door of Resurrection is located on [[Pudding Isle/1.6|Pudding Isle]], the only known Door of Resurrection to exist in the open world outside of a Domain. Players who enter an out-of-bounds area are directly teleported to this Door of Resurrection, instead of being forced to turn back.
* Inside of [[Summertime Odyssey]]'s mirages [[The Islands' Stirring Strings]], [[Immernachtreich Keep]] and [[Temple of the Star Latitudes]], as well as the quest domains [[Place of Revelations]] and [[Unknown Sanctuary]], Doors of Resurrection have a purple aura instead of the usual green, and can be interacted with to access the [[Party]] Setup screen, normally unavailable inside of domains.
** They can be interacted with during combat, making these the only way to change the party setup during combat.
