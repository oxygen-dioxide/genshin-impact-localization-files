{{Location Intro|1='''The Orchard of Pairidaeza''', also known as the '''Eternal Oasis''',|description=<p>The oasis was created by [[King Deshret]] as a cemetery for the [[Goddess of Flowers]]. He created it to preserve a single moment for all eternity as a memorial to her; as such, everything in the oasis is frozen in place, from the animals to the water, the latter of which can be walked on.

It lies beneath [[Mt. Damavand]] and can only be entered through [[Deshret's Glass Goblet]], which is located beneath it.</p><p>The [[Traveler]] visits the Eternal Oasis with [[Jeht]] in the [[World Quest]] ''[[The Eternal Dream, Ever Lush]]''. She leaves her [[Jebrael|father]]'s axe and her [[Ufairah|mother]]'s notes next to a tree there, where they can be found from that point forward.</p><p>There are three chairs in the middle of the oasis, one for each of the three God-Kings of Sumeru. Abbreviated forms of their names are written in [[Deshret Script]] on the chairs.

There is a withered [[Irminsul]] tree similar to that on [[Tsurumi Island]], [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] and [[Dragonspine]] located beside the central island, indicating the presence of the [[Celestial Nail]] that has fell onto Mt. Damavand. </p>}}

==Trivia==
* The [[Dendro Treasure Compass]] cannot be used in this location.
* After the completion of the {{Quest|Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises}}, the Eternal Oasis becomes one of only two places in all of Teyvat that fully preserves a reference to [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Rukkhadevata]]'s original existence after [[Irminsul/Modifications#Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|her removal from Irminsul]], as one of the three thrones has her name engraved in Deshret Script. The other is a name given to a hypothetical ancient tree as an altered explanation for the creation of [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]].

===Etymology===
* ''Pairidaēza'' is the Avestan word for an enclosed garden, especially {{w|paradise garden}}s owned by Persian nobles and royals.
** The word entered Ancient Greek as {{Wt|παράδεισος|''parádeisos''}}, becoming synonymous with the biblical Garden of Eden as well as its cognate "paradise."
