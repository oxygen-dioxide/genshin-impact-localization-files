==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Yan'er is a childhood friend of [[Hiromi]] and [[Shun]], often being referred to as "Big Sis" by them. They used to hang out at [[Uyuu Restaurant]] together before the [[Sakoku Decree]] took effect, upon which she and Shun went treasure hunting in Liyue, while Hiromi ended up as a Shogunate soldier, much to both of their disgust.

The [[Traveler]] would later encounter her in some ruins south of Wuwang Hill where she addressed herself as a researcher studying [[Qingce Village]] and told them about the legend of "[[Chi]]."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Chi of Yore}}</ref> Believing treasure to be found there, she directed her Treasure Hoarders to investigate and pilfer any treasure they could find, but their attempts were unsuccessful due to the presence of [[Ruin Machines]] inside. She told the Traveler of her discoveries, where they were able to defeat the automatons and claimed the treasure for themselves, much to her irritation.

Sometime after this, she cooperated with [[Raptor]] in an attempt to pilfer treasures from the [[Abyss Order]]. They even hired the [[Grand Thief]] to help, although he was killed and no treasures were found.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Involuntary Sacrifice}}</ref>

After the coordinated heist, Yan'er and Shun were pursued by [[Sun Yu]] and [[Little Que'er]]. While they managed to avoid the [[Guhua Clan|Guhua]] disciples, Yan'er was separated from Shun and fell into a pit, where [[Mountain Shaper]] arrived and encased her in amber both to protect her from being injured by the fall and to punish her for trespassing.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Hiromi's Watch}}</ref> Hiromi, wishing to learn of her whereabouts, asked the Traveler to help look for her. The Traveler found her in a pit at [[Mt. Hulao]], encased in amber and freed her. She feigned ignorance about knowing Hiromi, but promised to meet him at Uyuu Restaurant when she had the time.
