{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the location)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr rawr!

:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawwr!
:'''Vigilant Yumkasaurus:''' Roar!
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, are we interrupting its mealtime? It sure looks annoyed...

;(If the player tries to [[indwell]] the Yumkasaurus during the fight)
:{{Black Screen|You feel a strong will reject your attempt at indwelling...}}
:;(Quest restarts)

;(After defeating the Yumkasaurus)
:{{Black Screen|Ah. It's something furry. Something furry is blocking your path...}}
:'''Energetic Alpaca:''' Mmm?
:'''Vigilant Yumkasaurus:''' Roarrr...
:'''Energetic Alpaca:''' Mmmmm&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? So you're all friends, then?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr rawr!
:{{Black Screen|Someone who seems in charge of watching the Alpacas comes over and calms the Yumkasaurus...}}
:'''Wactana:''' Hey, hey, calm yourself, [[Half-Baked]]. See, that's why you've got your name, making rash judgments like you always do.
:'''"Half-Baked":''' Rawr...
:'''Wactana:''' Don't worry about him, he's just got too strong a sense of duty. Gets all antsy when there are strangers about. But it's also thanks to that dedication that I've got an easy time over here taking care of these Alpacas.
:'''Wactana:''' Anyway! What brings you people to my little spot?
:{{DIcon}} Just roaming about. You know, on our adventures.
::'''Wactana:''' Ah, adventurers, then! That said, I imagine Half-Baked saw you as dangerous folks with the scary, scary auras.
:{{DIcon}} I've been considering an idyllic, pastoral life recently...
::'''Wactana:''' Then you've come to the right place. Just leave all the Alpaca care to your Saurian, like I do, and the world's your oyster!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Paimon didn't know that Yumkasaurs could do that. And here we were thinking the Alpacas were about to get attacked! Guess it was all just a misunderstanding, huh?
:'''Wactana:''' Aye, and a common one it is, too. I know my fella looks fierce, but he's pretty close to yon' Alpacas. Why, I'd even call them friends!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrooo... Rawr! Rawr! Raaawr!
:'''Wactana:''' Hmm? What's up, little guy? You wanna be friends with them too?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawrrr!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, guess so. But yeah, thinking about it, you usually just hang out with the two of us. Some animal friends...
:'''Wactana:''' That would do 'im good, yes. Would be quite the adorable scene, too, don't you think &mdash; a lil' [[Tepetlisaur]] surrounded by Alpaca friends? Me, I could chow down on three bowls of [[Blazed Meat Stew]] before I got bored of it.
:'''Wactana:''' Still, that'll depend on whether my Alpacas agree or not. Friendship's not to be forced, and all. Wouldn't you say so, Half-Baked?
:'''"Half-Baked":''' Mrrmph.
:{{DIcon}} Oho, what's this? Someone doesn't wanna get friendly with our {{Little One}}?
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey, no need to get all defensive! Let's just give {{Little One}} a chance to try this out for himself.
::'''Paimon:''' Kids only grow when they learn how to get by through their own hard work, right?
:{{DIcon}} It's alright. Whatever happens, {{Little One}}'s still got us.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon knows you're trying to be nice just in case things don't work out... But there's no need to be this pessimistic from the get-go!
::'''Paimon:''' Kids need more encouragement to grow up strong and healthy! That's right, {{Little One}}, you can do it! Paimon believes in you!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Wactana:''' Well, your Tepetlisaur's got confidence coming out of its ears, or I'm blind. Guess I'll head back and get some rest. Just holler if there's trouble...
:'''Wactana:''' Wait, you know what? Might as well holler for Half-Baked instead. He's the Alpaca expert here, after all... Just kidding. Alright, little fella, you've got this. Good luck!

;(Talk to Wactana, optional)
:'''Wactana:''' "I have neither goals I must reach, nor have I urgent desires. I am a happy shepherd. I care only for alpacas, for the seasons and things that grow, for the cool breeze and rains..."
:'''Wactana:''' That's my favorite song. What do you think? Pretty good, huh?

;(Talk to "Half-Baked", optional)
:'''"Half-Baked":''' Roar!

;(Talk to "Half-Baked" while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''"Half-Baked":''' One, two, three, four.
:'''"Half-Baked":''' Four... It's hiding again. Where has it gone?

;(Talk to [[Energetic Alpaca]])
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roooah... Rawr?
:'''Energetic Alpaca:''' Mmmmm&mdash;
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wooo... Rrrooo...
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Is this one holding a grudge because of our misunderstanding with Half-Baked?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh well, not much we can do about that now. C'mon, {{Little One}}. Let's try our luck elsewhere!

;(Talk to Energetic Alpaca again, optional)
:'''Energetic Alpaca:''' (Looks like it's still mad at us...)

;(Talk to [[Dopey Alpaca]])
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Dopey Alpaca:''' ...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roar...? Rawr! Raaawr!
:'''Dopey Alpaca:''' ...
:'''Dopey Alpaca:''' ...Mmmm?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Dopey Alpaca:''' ...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rroo...
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't look like there's much hope here...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, uh, these things happen, you know? Don't feel down, {{Little One}}. You've still got a chance!

;(Talk to Dopey Alpaca again, optional)
:'''Dopey Alpaca:''' ...
:'''Dopey Alpaca:''' ...Mmm?

;(Talk to [[Greedy Alpaca]])
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Greedy Alpaca:''' Mmmmm&mdash;
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roooah... Ooroo...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh boy, looks like we interrupted a feeding session... Don't worry, {{Little One}}. This was just bad timing, that's all! Let's try our luck elsewhere.

;(Talk to Greedy Alpaca again, optional)
:'''Greedy Alpaca:''' Mmmmm&mdash;

;(After talking to Energetic Alpaca, Dopey Alpaca, and Greedy Alpaca)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, none of these three Alpacas wanna make friends with {{Little One}}...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders if there are {{Color|buzzword|any Alpacas nearby that we haven't asked}}...

;(Approach [[Scaredy-Cat Alpaca]] below the cliff)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Scaredy-Cat Alpaca:''' Mmm...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What's this other Alpaca doing here?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong. Is it trapped down there?
----
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' We've got some wooden planks here. Let's use 'em to make it a way up!

;(Talk to Scaredy-Cat Alpaca after picking up the wooden planks, optional)
:'''Scaredy-Cat Alpaca:''' (It looks terrified...)

;(Place the wooden planks)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:{{Black Screen|Only after much "Rawr! Rawr!"-ing encouragement from {{Little One}} does the timid Alpaca climb back up using the freshly-laid wood plank path...}}
:'''Scaredy-Cat Alpaca:''' Moo... Mmmmoo&mdash;
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Oroo? Rawr! Raaawr!
:{{Black Screen|Faced with {{Little One}}'s enthusiasm, the timid-looking Alpaca seems unafraid, instead bending down and gently touching {{Little One}} with its nose...}}
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roooah... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe! Guess that means you're getting on great, huh?
:{{DIcon}} A friend of yours, {{Little One}}, is a friend of mine.
::'''Paimon:''' And Paimon's too... Wait, when did this become a competition?
:{{DIcon}} I'm kinda jealous...
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Jealous of who exactly...?
:'''Paimon:''' Still, it's kinda dangerous for this Alpaca to be out here completely on its own. We'd better go tell Wactana what's going on.
:'''Paimon:''' Also, Paimon's sure she'll be happy to hear that {{Little One}}'s made a friend, too!

;(Talk to Scaredy-Cat Alpaca, optional)
:'''Scaredy-Cat Alpaca:''' (Doesn't look quite so scared anymore...)

;(Talk to "Half-Baked" again while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''"Half-Baked":''' One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
:'''"Half-Baked':''' All four are here.

;(Talk to Wactana)
:'''Wactana:''' I see you're back, little fella. How did it go? Make any Alpaca friends?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr rawr!
:'''Wactana:''' Haha, aren't you a happy camper? Why, you're even making me feel all jolly!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Wactana, shouldn't you be a bit more concerned about what happens to the Alpacas? The one {{Little One}} made friends with was in a real tight spot back there.
:'''Wactana:''' That so? Guess I gotta talk to Half-Baked real quick then, tell it to take more care.
:{{DIcon}} You're way too chill about this.
::'''Wactana:''' I mean, I am living the dream! C'mon, be happy for me and stuff!
:{{DIcon}} Half-Baked has it rough, huh...
::'''Wactana:''' Sure... But he was always a massive worrywart. If I took him off Alpaca guard, he'd start losing fur from stress, I tell you!
::'''Wactana:''' So this arrangement's best. Job satisfaction for him, free-and-easy living for me. Win-win, wouldn't you say?
:'''Wactana:''' Ah, yes. If {{Little One}}'s fond of the Alpaca toy over by the side, I can let y'all have it.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawwr!
:'''Paimon:''' Guess {{Little One}} doesn't know what "standing on ceremony" is, huh. Thanks then, Wactana!
:'''Wactana:''' Eh, no biggie. And if you wanna drop by again, you're always welcome.
