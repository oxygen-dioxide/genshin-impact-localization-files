[[Version 4.1]]
* After Creating a Furnishing, the schematic selection interface will no longer move so that the selected schematic appears at the bottom, and will instead align the interface so that the selected schematic is in the middle of the screen. Moreover, schematic for which the player runs out of materials will not immediately be moved to the bottom of the list; the list will only be updated after switching to another screen.
* When picking a character to assist the Creation process, the currently selected character will appear at the top of the list instead of at their place according to their available [[Utility Passive#Bonuses on Crafting Methods|Utility Passive]] bonus or obtainment order.
