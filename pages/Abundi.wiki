:'''Abundi:''' Hello, are you a helper, here to provide some supplies? Or a friend in need of our help?
:{{DIcon|Reputation}} About my reputation with the Flower-Feather Clan... ''(Available after unlocking [[Tribe Reputation]])''
::'''Abundi:''' Thank you for your supplies and help. Rest assured, the corresponding recompense will be yours.
:;(Opens Tlalocan<nowiki>:</nowiki> Flower-Feather Clan Reputation menu)
:{{DIcon}} Hello. What is this place? ''(Available after unlocking Tribe Reputation)''
::'''Abundi:''' Here's the Obsidian Totem Pole that belongs to us, the Flower-Feather Clan.
::'''Abundi:''' If you've been to the other tribes, then you've probably seen similar stone pillars before.
::'''Abundi:''' This totem pole looked like this when I was a kid, and hasn't changed a bit. It has always borne witness to the ebbs and flows our clan has gone through.
::'''Abundi:''' I believe we shall continue to soar high so long as it endures.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Abundi:''' I am the assistant responsible for looking after our tribe's supplies. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
::'''Abundi:''' Whether it's daily tribal affairs or our all-important flying squads, support is needed everywhere you look.
::'''Abundi:''' I was a flying squad member when I was younger, and I know very well what's required.
::'''Abundi:''' I've gotten old now and get dizzy as soon as you plop me atop a [[Saurian]], I can't just stay idle.
::'''Abundi:''' Being able to help out everyone here is a position that suits me.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Abundi:''' See you later, and stay safe.
