Hapless traveler, what brings you to this deep underground cave?<br />
Did the legendary tales of Hasad the Golden Adventurer entice you so?<br />
Know that the tales told the world over are but a speck of sand compared to what I have experienced.<br />
Only the nameless god of the desert knows what terrible misfortune has befallen me.<br />
Those ancient secrets unbeknownst to anyone,<br />
They have laid layer upon layer of curses on me,<br />
And I have become the oracle of a creature invisible.

Three challenges I have set forth, by order of the evil spirit watching me from the shadows.<br />
Within them I hide treasures brought forth from the cursed city of brass.<br />
If fear shall not stay your greed and curiosity,<br />
Then follow my path.
