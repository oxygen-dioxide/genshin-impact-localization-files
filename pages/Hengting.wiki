==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hengting:''' *sigh* I can't spend my whole life growing mass-market tea, can I...
:'''Hengting:''' That stuff's often poured as the first cup for a customer who's just sat down. Hardly any difference between that and a cup of water.
:'''Hengting:''' If that's all my effort amounts to, then what's the point?
:'''Aige:''' Is it really that bad? Did your master say something again?
:'''Hengting:''' Two days ago, he said I was good enough to strike out on my own. But I had a feeling that he meant I was a gone case.
:'''Hengting:''' He didn't even look at me when he said those things.
:'''Aige:''' Um, perhaps you're overthinking this...
:'''Aige:''' Your master's always been strict with his students. He would never let someone sub-par go independent and ruin his reputation!
:'''Aige:''' Maybe he didn't say anything because he thinks you're completely ready, which is why nothing more needs to be said.
:'''Hengting:''' Could that really be?
:'''Aige:''' And there's no hurry either, is there? You've been doing this for, what? Less than ten years? It would be unrealistic to expect to surpass the masters right away!
:'''Aige:''' Given our age, it's normal to be far from being masters of our respective professions.
:'''Aige:''' The tea baskets I weave look pretty ordinary, right? I think it's better that way. At least I'm not too stressed out about my job.
:'''Hengting:''' I'm just glad you're not always tired. But I won't be satisfied with growing "ordinary" tea!
:'''Hengting:''' I need to think of something to improve the quality.
:'''Aige:''' How about our trip? Is that getting delayed again?
:'''Hengting:''' Let's await the second harvest. If the quality improves, then we'll travel!
:'''Aige:''' And if it doesn't?
:'''Hengting:''' Then we wait for another harvest, of course!
