{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kulemana:''' Ugh, what am I gonna do? I can't even afford to hire anyone anymore... and our volcano project budget is just about drained. I need to come up with something.
<!-- black screen transition -->
:'''Kulemana:''' Hey, hey, hey! This stuff's for selling. If you're not buying, you're not touchi&mdash; Huh... Hey, you! Yeah, you with the blonde hair &mdash; hold on a sec, don't rush off. Let me get a better look at you.
:'''Kulemana:''' Hmm, just as I thought. That hair, glowing like the sun, and those eyes, as deep as the [[Night Kingdom]]... I can tell &mdash; no, I'm sure &mdash; that you're going to become someone incredible one day.
:'''Kulemana:''' Here, I've got a set of wondrous jade ornaments, each containing a different melody. Perfect for a real hero like you!
:'''Kulemana:''' Mind you, these are nothing short of priceless treasures. If anyone else wanted to buy them, I'd be asking for at least 10 million Mora. But I see you're meant to have them, so you can have them at just one-tenth of the price. What do you say?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, one-tenth!? That's a steal! But wait, isn't that still at least... a million Mora? That's a bit much, don't you think?
:'''Kulemana:''' Yeah, well... this is basically cost price. Small-time sellers like me don't make a ton of profit, you know?
:{{DIcon}} You really shouldn't be making money like that...
:{{DIcon}} Weren't you the one who said that a helper's worth a million Mora?
:'''Kulemana:''' Ah, so you heard all that, huh? Haha, guess I've got a habit of talking to myself...
:'''Kulemana:''' *sigh* Fine, since you caught me, I'll be real with you. I found this jade ornament by accident. It's not worth anywhere near that price.
:'''Kulemana:''' But well, as you heard, we're kinda strapped for cash &mdash; so much so that we can't even pay anyone to collect the buoy data.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, then just forget the buoy collection! Better than ripping people off, right?
:'''Kulemana:''' That won't do... Other organizations can just stop operating if they lack the funds, but our volunteer work also includes volcano observation.
:'''Kulemana:''' We planted those buoys to measure volcanic activity by collecting data on water temperature and the like.
:'''Kulemana:''' With the volcano becoming more active, we need to recover those buoys fast, or there could be serious consequences.
:'''Kulemana:''' Injured as I am, I can't break the buoys, let alone retrieve the data from them...
:'''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Why don't we help her out? This volcano stuff affects everyone, so we can't just ignore it...
:'''Kulemana:''' R&mdash;Really? If you're willing to help, these jade ornaments are all yours, for free! Consider it your reward. Sounds good?
:{{DIcon}} Didn't you mention a million Mora...?
:{{DIcon}} Oh, so this is all I get for a reward, huh?
:'''Kulemana:''' Don't worry. We haven't got much, but we certainly have more to give you than just these jade ornaments.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, they're enough for us! After all, we're doing this for the safety of everyone near the volcano! So don't worry, we've got this.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Well, let's begin, then.
:;(Starts challenge)
:{{DIcon}} I'll need a moment to prepare.
::'''Kulemana:''' I'm good to go anytime.

;(Talk to Kulemana again after postponing, optional)
:'''Kulemana:''' So, are you ready?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Alright, I'll give it a try.
:;(Starts challenge)
:{{DIcon}} Maybe later.
::'''Kulemana:''' I'm good to go anytime.

;(Upon starting the challenge)
:'''Kulemana:''' Just make sure to destroy all the buoys!
<!-- The Great Buoy Retrieval
Target: Retrieve all the survey buoys within the time limit
Time: 2min -->
;(After completing the challenge)
:{{Black Screen|You hand over all the buoy data you just obtained to Kulemana.}}
:'''Kulemana:''' Phew, what a relief. Looks like the volcano situation isn't as bad as we thought. Guess we can sleep easy tonight...
:'''Kulemana:''' It's all thanks to you, of course. If you hadn't stepped in and helped us without holding grudges, things wouldn't have gone so smoothly.
:'''Kulemana:''' Please, take this as a token of my gratitude &mdash; and as an apology, to boot!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, well, since you put it that way... we graciously accept!
:{{DIcon}} What do you plan to do next?
:'''Kulemana:''' I've still got some cargo stocked up. Normal operations should put our finances back on track.
:'''Kulemana:''' Of course, we're not in an emergency situation this time, so I'll be doing honest business, don't you worry!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
Available after completing Kulemana's challenge.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kulemana:''' Ten, twenty... Sold a bunch of stuff, so our finances should be healthy for now...
:{{DIcon}} Not going to try and make a bit more?
::'''Kulemana:''' Haha, nope! I'm calling it quits for now! If you hadn't been so understanding and helped me out, I'd have gotten myself into trouble over those couple of jade bits for sure.
::'''Kulemana:''' Besides, constantly chasing money is boring. It's just a hobby for me. Observing the volcano is what really matters.
::'''Kulemana:''' We can always make more money, but if an eruption warning doesn't get sent out on our account... that would be a huge loss.
::{{DIcon}} Don't you get funding from the [[Speaker's Chamber]]?
::'''Kulemana:''' We didn't apply for any. With all the stuff they already have to deal with on the daily, I doubt they need the extra stress.
::'''Kulemana:''' The gang and I are a different story. We're used to funding our own travels by picking up odd jobs as we go. It's become a lifestyle, you know?
::'''Kulemana:''' As such, monitoring the volcano while we travel isn't a big deal, just like how you often help people in need &mdash; it just comes naturally!
:{{DIcon}} Alright then, see you around.
::'''Kulemana:''' Take care, hehe. May we meet again!
