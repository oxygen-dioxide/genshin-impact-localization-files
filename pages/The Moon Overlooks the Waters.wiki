==Trivia==
*The Chinese and Japanese names of the constellation roughly translate to {{Lang|"Moon's Proxies of One Thousand Rivers"|zh=月摄千川|zh_rm=Yuè Shè Qiān Chuān|zh_lit=Moon's Proxies and One Thousand Rivers|ja=月に摂す千の川|ja_rm=Tsuki ni Sessu Sen no Kawa|ja_lit=One Thousand Rivers That Serve as Proxies for the Moon|sort=zh,ja}}. These names are likely from the combination of two Chinese philosophical phrases.<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv12863163 {{Lang|mini=1|zh=【原神】技能名称出处解析：珊瑚宫心海}}]</ref>
**The first quote is {{Lang|"all the moons reflected on the water are the proxies of one moon"|zh=一切水月一月摄|zh_rm=yīqiè shuǐyuè yī yuè shè}} from the Buddhist poem ''{{w|Song of Enlightenment}}'' by the Chinese Zen monk {{w|Yongjia Xuanjue}} (665–713).
**The second quote is {{Lang|"the moon reflects in myriad rivers"|zh=月映万川|zh_rm=yuè yìng wàn chuān|ja_rm=Tsuki ni Sessu Sen no Kawa|sort=zh,ja}} by the Chinese philosopher {{w|Zhu Xi}} (1130–1200), who is one of the founders of Neo-Confucianism and extended the above Buddhist philosophy to establish his cosmology of heavenly principles.
