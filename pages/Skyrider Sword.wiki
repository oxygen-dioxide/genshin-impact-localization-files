==Description==
Leap, the master swordsman [[Skyrider]] did, from the heights of Jueyun Karst.<br />
He pierced the clouds as the winds hollered by his ears,<br />
But what followed was the sound of shattering.<br />
What he had hoped for was something swordsmanship could not bring him.<br />
He pawned the sword for medicine,<br />
But die it did not, his dream of flight.
