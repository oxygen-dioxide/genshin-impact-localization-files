{{Description|What kind of interesting potions can we make out of these different ingredients?<br>Enjoy a novel potion-making experience with Paimon!}}
'''Glittering Elixirs''' is a [[Web Event]] in [[Version 3.6]].

==Event Duration==
May 11, 2023 – May 20, 2023 23:59 (UTC+8)
* Rewards cannot be claimed after the event ends. Please claim them in time.

==Eligibility==
Travelers who have reached Adventure Rank 10 or above can participate in this event.

==Event Description==
During the event, you can log into Genshin Impact daily, consume Original Resin, and complete other missions to obtain potion crafting materials.

After successfully crafting potions, you can earn Primogems and other in-game rewards based on the total number of potions crafted. During the event, Nahida and Cyno will also visit your booth, and gift you special ingredients. Complete the dialogues and obtain all of their ingredients to gain additional Primogems and in-game rewards.

==Obtaining Ingredients==
Travelers can obtain potion-making ingredients through the following methods:
# Complete the following actions within Genshin Impact and the web event, including: Log into Genshin Impact daily, consume 40 Original Resin daily, and complete other missions to obtain the corresponding number of potion ingredients.
#* Log in to the web event daily
#* Explore Genius Invokation TCG Page
#* Log in to Genshin Impact daily (0/1)
#* Use 40 Original Resin daily (0/40)
#* Claim Genshin Impact's Check-In rewards on HoYoLAB today
# Daily missions refresh at 04:00 (Server Time) each day. Unclaimed potion ingredients will be cleared at the same time as the daily reset. Please claim and use the potion ingredients in time. Claimed potion ingredients will not be cleared.
# After Nahida and Cyno visit the Traveler and Paimon's booth, they will deliver special potion crafting materials and normal crafting materials after the special dialogue is clicked on. Nahida and Cyno will each trigger two special dialogues and provide the corresponding potion ingredients respectively.

* You can only trigger dialogue with either Nahida or Cyno and obtain their potion ingredients once per day.
* If Travelers try to visit the web event at around 04:00 (Server Time), which is when the daily missions refresh, they may encounter a brief network error. Please refresh the page if you encounter this error.

==Crafting Potions==
# When crafting potions, Travelers will need to separately place a plant-based potion crafting ingredient, another potion crafting ingredient, and water or oil. After the above ingredients have been added, the mixing process can begin. Travelers need to control the stirring rod to mix the ingredients, and after mixing is complete, they must use the bellows to heat up the mixture to complete a potion.
# Potion ingredients will not be consumed if the potion-making process fails, and Travelers can try again multiple times.
# During the potion-making process, Travelers may click the "Reset" button at any time to start over. Resetting does not consume potion-making ingredients.
# After successfully crafting a potion, the associated potion formula will be unlocked. Travelers can enter the potion archive, and click on "Autocraft" below the potion to craft the potion again with a single click.

* Exiting the potion-making process before it is complete will not consume potion-making ingredients.
* If Travelers try to craft potions at around 04:00 (Server Time), which is when the daily missions refresh, they may encounter a brief network error. Please refresh the page if you encounter this error.
