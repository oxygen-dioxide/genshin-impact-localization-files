Recently, I often feel like I can't improve anymore. I don't think I'm making progress at all, whether it's work at the [[Favonius Cathedral|Church]] or the songs I practice every day. Though I can still help people around me, I understand I can't be like this anymore and I have to improve.

I went to my [[Jean|sister]] for her advice, and she said what she has done so far is to "persevere."

"Don't be in a hurry to grow.

Growth is a kind of accumulation. Stick to what you have been doing and the rest will follow."

I believe in what my sister said, so I would like to share this secret tip with you, [[Traveler]].

May your journey be accompanied by songs and happiness.
