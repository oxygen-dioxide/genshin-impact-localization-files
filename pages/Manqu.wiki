==Profile==
Manqu is a member of the [[Saurian Relics Association]]. When the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]] and [[Little One]] ran into him while exploring Natlan, Manqu greeted them before noticing that the Little One had the [[Xiuhcoatl|Flamelord's Blessing]] and explained it to the Traveler, asking that they give it to the [[Children of Echoes]] so it could be "dealt" with. The Traveler, understanding the underlying meaning behind his words, refused to, not wanting to abandon their companion. Seeing their resolve, Manqu instead pointed out another way they could remove the mark; by making a pilgrimage to the volcano and washing the name remembered by {{Rubi|Fallen Dragon|Xiuhcoatl}} to remove the blessing.

Manqu would later ask [[Pacal]] for his permission to head to the volcano, but Pacal refused, as many others had attempted but failed the trials, losing their lives in the process. The Traveler, Paimon and Little One arrived, and seeing their resolve, Pacal decided to give them his permission after a brief duel. Manqu would remain behind while the three explored the volcano, coming out with a [[Golden Entreaty (Revelations from the Past)|Golden Entreaty]]. Manqu was shocked to see a Golden Entreaty, as they were believed to be nonexistent. The Traveler then mentioned [[Ochkanatlan]]; Manqu caught the term and explained that it was an ancient city north of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]. He could not help them regarding the city, as both his tribe and the Saurian Relic Association forbade entering it due to an incident several years with the Association where a team went missing when they were commissioned to investigate it. Manqu later bade farewell to the trio to record his thoughts on the Golden Entreaty, wishing them luck on removing the Flamelord's Blessing.

==Dialogue==
{{Stub|First interaction should be moved when a more suitable location is found, ideally as pre-quest dialogue, but investigation needs to be done to see if it is possible to "accidentally" complete things before encountering Manqu. Additionally, verification is needed:

1. The first interaction happens at the Teleport Waypoint directly southwest of the Tequemecan Valley Statue of The Seven. There also is another "first encounter"-location at the teleport point east to the Arena with the same conversation. Both are avoidable by running away fast enough/avoiding the area. Are there other locations?
2. Are there any variations of this dialogue? Any at all?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(First encounter, upon approaching one of the {{cx|"first encounter"-locations}} after completing {{Quest|Lost in the Woods}})
:'''???:''' One moment, friend!
;(Dialogue begins, when Manqu is close enough to the player)
:'''???:''' Excuse me. You two are... travelers from beyond these lands, yes?
:'''???:''' Heh... Sorry, but is this little [[Tepetlisaur]] your companion?
:'''???:''' Even got a lovely scarf tied to his tail, I see! Haha, he sure is a little bundle of energy.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup, this is {{Little One}}. We met as soon as we arrived in [[Natlan]], and he's been traveling with us since.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''???:''' Traveling together, are you? Hmm. Well, then, forgive me for being presumptuous, but that kind of behavior is dangerous indeed...
:{{DIcon}} Traveling together with a [[Saurian]], you mean?
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I've been careful not to get et...
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, {{Little One}} wouldn't do that to you!
:'''Paimon:''' Humans and Saurians living together is pretty normal here, isn't it?
:'''Paimon:''' Or do you mean that traveling is dangerous, and so {{Little One}} shouldn't wander off too far?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Err?
:'''???:''' Not exactly... Travel's good for Saurians and humans alike. But if you'll forgive my bluntness, {{Little One}} here is quite different.
:'''???:''' Sorry. All this talk, and I haven't even introduced myself! Manqu's the name. I am a researcher for the [[Saurian Relics Association]], and am responsible for scholarly inquiries into certain tribal customs...
:'''Manqu:''' Simply put, I study past tribal customs.
:'''Manqu:''' And of course, I've heard our little Tepetlisaur's name. May I have yours too?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Manqu:''' Ah, such energy. Looks like {{Traveler}} and Paimon have been taking good care of you...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Err... Err?
:'''Paimon:''' Of course we have! We've feasted a ton in our time together, haven't we, {{Little One}}?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Little One}}, don't go wandering off!
:'''Manqu:''' Shame. He's such a vigorous little one too...
:{{DIcon}} So, what's the danger exactly?
:{{DIcon}} Mind your tone, would you?
:'''Manqu:''' My apologies. Eloquence is not my strong suit... But I really do think it is a shame.
:'''Manqu:''' Alright. I'll be forthright. You must have seen many little Tepetlisaurs before, yes? {{Little One}} is different from them.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, he has a beautiful ribbon on his tail!
::'''Manqu:''' Haha, that was your doing, no? But that's not what I'm talking about &mdash; rather, I speak of the mark on his horn.
:{{DIcon}} You mean the red mark on his horn?
:'''Manqu:''' That is not a mark that an ordinary Saurian would bear. In truth, records indicate this to be the "{{Rubi|Flamelord's|[[Xiuhcoatl]]}} Blessing".
:'''Manqu:''' How to put it... Saurians with this mark often possess incredible power, such as greater strength than other Saurians, swifter swimming speed, or being able to leap to greater heights.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds like a perk to me.
:'''Manqu:''' But as I said before, this is a blessing from the Flamelord, and not their own power.
:'''Manqu:''' This is the power of the far more ancient dragons, and Natlan's Saurians can no longer withstand it today.
:'''Manqu:''' The [[Wayob]] and the [[Night Kingdom]] also reject this power, and as such, refuse to accept such Saurians.
:'''Manqu:''' And in the process of growing, they will sometimes be killed by this power, or driven mad by it... Both dangerous possibilities.
:'''Manqu:''' Perhaps, I believe, you should deliver him to the [[Children of Echoes]]. They will deal with the matter appropriately.
:{{DIcon}} "Deal with the matter"?
:{{DIcon}} That phrasing is ice-cold.
:'''Manqu:''' Again, apologies for my clumsy words. But I believe it best to leave this to us locals.
:{{DIcon}} ...Thanks for letting me know.
:'''Manqu:''' But you do not intend to give up on him, I presume?
:{{DIcon}} Giving up should never be the first resort.
:{{DIcon}} I do not abandon my companions.
:'''Manqu:''' ...*sigh* Alright. Very well, outlander. Your resolve is evident.
:'''Manqu:''' I do not know if I should reveal this to you, for this is a secret that only we locals know...
:'''Manqu:''' ...But if you wish to save {{Little One}}, you must take him on a pilgrimage to the volcano.
:'''Manqu:''' Legend has it that our tribal warriors would carry a token that was split in two, and in the great volcano they would wash the name of their companion as remembered by the Fallen {{Rubi|Dragon|Xiuhcoatl}}.
:'''Manqu:''' Then, they would gain their Saurian the Night Kingdom's acceptance once more.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you telling me this?
:'''Manqu:''' Because the people of the six great tribes no longer attempt this, nor have they the time to spare for such an attempt.
:'''Manqu:''' But you are an outlander, a traveler from afar, unbound by the old-fashioned ideas the tribes hold.
:'''Manqu:''' And if you succeed, you will prove beyond doubt that the inscriptions on some ancient relics and crumbling scrolls remain true to this day.
:'''Manqu:''' This is of the utmost importance to me... so if you would like to try, I will help you find that token.
:'''Manqu:''' And as for you, you will be able to save your companion.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like a win-win.
:{{DIcon}} It's worth a shot...
:'''Manqu:''' In that case, I shall let you know if I find the place. Alternatively, you could come find me. My research will take me near the Children of Echoes for the time being...
:'''Manqu:''' Until we meet again, then, friend.
:{{Black Screen|The Saurian Relics Association member, Manqu, turns and departs.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey! {{Little One}}! Quit running around already!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roar...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, and by the way, {{Traveler}}, is that guy gone? He didn't say anything weird, did he?
:{{DIcon}} Long story short...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... In other words, {{Little One}} is sick, and we need to grab some stuff and take him up the volcano to get that illness cured...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Err?
:'''Paimon:''' *sigh* Not that he seems to understand anything that's going on, of course.
:'''Paimon:''' Not that it matters. Maybe we'll solve all the problems before he gets big. That way, there'll be nothing standing between him and growing up healthy!
:'''Paimon:''' Now, we can't be sure if we can rely on that guy... But if it's a token we need, we can look around too, can't we? Who knows, we might find it even faster!
:{{DIcon}} {{Little One}}...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Err?
:{{DIcon}} You come along too!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
;(After the dialogue)
:'''Paimon:''' Then let's get rolling, and look for this token while we're at it!

;(Subsequent interactions)
:'''Manqu:''' Oh, hello. How have you been lately?
:'''Manqu:''' Or is there something you would like to confirm?
:{{DIcon}} About the Flamelord's Blessing...
::'''Manqu:''' The Flamelord's Blessing... Some hold that it is a kind of atavism, because everyone has always been convinced that this power must stem from a deeper, ancestral source.
::'''Manqu:''' Yet, according to the Saurian Relics Association's records, these young Saurians that bear this mark are wracked by uncontrollable forces that rise within their bodies as they grow...
::'''Manqu:''' This power rips and tears their bodies, turning them into something altogether different from regular Saurians... It drives them berserk, and causes them to lose their sanity.
::'''Manqu:''' The best example is [[Holawaqa Ngoubou|Holawaqa]], the Qucusaur tyrant... It is said that it once had the Flamelord's Blessing bestowed upon it.
:{{DIcon}} How would the tribe "deal with the matter," again?
::'''Manqu:''' They would send him back to the Night Kingdom, for while he could perhaps never gain the acceptance of the dragons or the Night Kingdom while he lives...
::'''Manqu:''' ...Once he has left this world, he will without doubt return to the embrace of the night. This may seem cold, yet there he would be reunited with the souls of all beings...
::'''Manqu:''' Forgive my presumption, but perhaps that too might be seen as a form of kindness.
::{{DIcon}} Any clues about the token?
::'''Manqu:''' Some, but... I need to find someone who can confirm them. Later on, perhaps you'll find me over with [[Pacal]], leader of the Children of Echoes.
::'''Manqu:''' He might look a little... over the top, perhaps, but in all frankness, he's more reliable than the most solid of crystals.
:{{DIcon}} I have no more questions. Goodbye!
::'''Manqu:''' Your visits are always welcome, friend.
