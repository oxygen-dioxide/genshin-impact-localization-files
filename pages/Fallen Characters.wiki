'''Fallen Characters''' are characters who have been incapacitated due to their [[Health]] dropping to zero (death), due to drowning, or due to falling out of bounds.

Dead characters can be revived with certain [[:Category:Revive Dishes|Dishes]], by certain [[:Category:Revival Constellations|Constellations]], or by visiting a [[Statue of The Seven]]. They cannot be sent on [[Expeditions]] or added to a new [[party]] they are not already in. After dying, they lose all their [[Energy]].

==Types==
===Death===
'''Death''' is the most common type of falling that occurs when a character's HP drops down to zero. This usually happens because the incoming [[Damage]] or [[HP Loss]] exceeds the current character's or enemy's HP. Enemy death is also triggered automatically after drowning or falling out of bounds. Certain enemy attacks also trigger the death of the active character.

When death is triggered but not detected by the client before the character is switched out, the fallen animation can be entirely skipped, but the character nonetheless cannot be switched back in until revived.

===Out of Bounds and Drowning===
Going '''[[Out of Bounds]]''' and '''Drowning''' causes all characters in the party to fall. This, however, does not trigger the death of the active character. Instead, all characters' energy is reset to zero, the character is respawned where their stamina was last at maximum, and all characters lose 10% of their current HP.

If, after the penalty is applied, a character reaches zero HP, they will die and remain fallen until revived.

When drowning is triggered but not detected by the client, the fallen animation and voice-over may be played instead if the character is on land.

==Game Over Screen==
When all party members fall, a Game Over screen will show with a tip depending on how the last character in the party fell. Clicking on the Revive button will revive the entire party at the closest [[Teleport Waypoint]].
