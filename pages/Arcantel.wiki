{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arcantel:''' Miss, have you ever heard of the "Ultra-Revivalist School"?
:'''Oia:''' No, I'm afraid to say I'm a bit behind the times when it comes to fashion.
:'''Arcantel:''' Nonononono, that's not your fault! You know why? Because I just created it!
:'''Oia:''' Ohhh, so what does it mean?
:'''Arcantel:''' It's a school of art that I am about to guide, pioneer, and carry up to lofty heights!
:'''Arcantel:''' As for what the style will be... Hehe...
:'''Arcantel:''' That depends on what I end up drawing next!
:'''Oia:''' Wow, that sounds pretty impressive.
:'''Arcantel:''' ...Huh, really? You really think so?
:'''Oia:''' Of course! Isn't that how all popular art goes?
:'''Oia:''' They start with a concept, then give it a name, and finally, they try and give it as much exposure as they can so that it baffles as many people as possible, and... Tada! You've created the latest fad.
