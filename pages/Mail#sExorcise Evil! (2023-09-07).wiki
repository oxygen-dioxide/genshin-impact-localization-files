|text      = Evil spirits have been spotted behaving aggressively in the area recently. Though today is my birthday, as a [[Tianheng Thaumaturge]], how could I possibly take a day for rest and pleasure, and allow the evil spirits to run rampant?

I must set out, purge the evil spirits, and uphold peace in the region!

I am deeply aware of your fame in Liyue for your heroic deeds, and I presume you wouldn't miss such an opportunity? Why not join me, and indulge in the thrill of battle for a day, drinking deep the joy of victory and extirpating the evil spirits...

Ahem...

Apologies for what I just said, I forgot myself and my manners... But my invitation to you comes from the heart. It would undoubtedly be a source of regret for friends to be a thousand leagues away during such a joyous occasion. You needn't overly concern yourself with the flavor of the food, as I recently purchased a medicine most effective at negating the effects of spiciness with incredible alacrity.
