:[Record Begins]<br>
:CL-01: Now that all lords are present, let us begin.<br><br>
:CL-02: Before we start, allow me to ask &mdash; where is the Fourth Lord? If memory serves, Aj Awaj K'umilal Kan Ch'ule-L has been absent from the sessions of this council for quite some time. Tell me, Speaker, is that disdainful, decadent, decrepit old thing still holed up in his lonely citadel atop the high cliffs, lost in his futile research on the Phlogistonization of Life? Or has he already perished like the Sixth and Tenth Lords, drowned in his own folly and decay?<br><br>
:CL-01: According to the Fourth Lord, the research he has been undertaking has now reached a critical juncture. As such, he has been unable to participate in our recent councils.<br><br>
:CL-11: Hah, I doubt that. He is merely looking for an excuse to neglect his duties. If he truly loves research so much, why not relinquish his title as a sovereign ruler and instead serve under the [[Kukulkan|Regent]], who seems to share his facile obsession with technology?<br><br>
:CL-01: Watch your tone, Eleventh Lord. His absence will not hinder the proceedings of this vote.<br><br>
:CL-07: Let him rot in his domain. Speaker, begin the deliberations.<br><br>
:CL-01: Then let us proceed. This session has been convened upon the initiative of the Fifth Lord, who proposes that &mdash; in the interest of mitigating the risk of rebellion and ensuring long-term prosperity, stability, and peace &mdash; the sovereign rulers implement the neutralization of human settlements exceeding a certain scale within each of their respective territories. Should consensus be reached, even abstainers will be bound to uphold the council's decision. Let the session commence. Fifth Lord, you may now present your case.<br><br>
:CL-05: Comrades, brothers and sisters, esteemed sovereign rulers, hear my words. As you all know, of the [[Thirteen Sovereign Lords]] who govern [[Natlantea]], two have already fallen to humanity's schemes. My reasons for bringing forth this proposal need no further elaboration &mdash; I only hope that you will not continue to ignore the truth. At this very moment, the species known as humanity has become a threat to our noble kind. Their propagation and expansion have far exceeded our initial predictions, and now they have even stolen the secrets of wielding [[phlogiston]]. Admittedly, their understanding of phlogiston remains as crude as an [[Phlogiston Aphid|Aphid]]'s, yet the heights to which their overweening arrogance and ambition soar may be compared to that detestable [[Heavenly Principles|reaver from beyond the skies]]. If left unchecked, the kindling of rebellion will only grow more dangerous. As such, I, Aj K'astajibal Cha'ama' Ho'o Ch'ule-L, overseer of Ek' Pulinik, propose to this council: To keep their numbers within a controllable range, we must periodically neutralize human settlements within our domains by incinerating the excess. Clearly, such a course of action would require coordination among all present &mdash; lest the humans, in their cunning malevolence, flee across our territories, and in so doing escape their ordained fate, thereby undermining the effectiveness of such measures.<br><br>
:CL-02: The Sixth and Tenth Lords fell to their own weakness and incompetence. I have read the reports compiled by the [[Secret Source Servant|Servant]]s, and I can find no better word to describe them than disgraceful. The Sixth Lord was bested in combat by a mere human, then felled by a single arrow to the throat. The Tenth Lord's fate was even more contemptible &mdash; deceived into mistaking a crude human imitation of jade for my token, then ending up being sealed alive within the mountains. You should be grateful to the humans who killed them, for if they could be brought low by such creatures, what right did they have to sit among us as sovereign rulers?<br><br>
:CL-05: The matter at hand has nothing to do with how they perished, Jade Maiden.<br><br>
:CL-02: Do not mistake me, Fifth Lord. I do not stand in opposition to your proposal &mdash; on the contrary, I will cast my vote in its favor, for humanity is worthy of neither our clemency nor our tolerance. Yet still, I do not find your reasoning sound. If the day ever comes when humans truly imperil our kind, it would but prove that our kind have indeed grown too weak. And in their decline, they would deserve only to kneel before their subjugators and accept destined destruction, for there would be no need, nor possibility, to seek an alternative. The strong endure, the weak perish &mdash; that is the eternal truth of this world. Do not forget it.<br><br>
:CL-03: I abstain. The fate of these soulless creatures bound to [[Constellation|star signs]] concerns me not. Do with them as you will.<br><br>
:CL-09: I, too, shall abstain. Fifth Lord, surely you do not truly hope to persuade us that these wretched insects, these creatures who know naught but to cower in the dark and slaughter one another without end, will one day suddenly unite? That they might march upon the Sacred City, which not even the surper of the sky could shake? Such absurd hysteria from a dragon, such loathsome cowardice... Unworthy even of my defiance.<br><br>
:CL-13: You and your arrogance are what is truly loathsome, Ninth Lord. If you do not support this lofty-minded proposal, then go, wriggle back to your beloved [[Chichen Uctokah]]. Continue there in self-deception, pretending your land will never be threatened by these insects, for even the most witless ants would not be so foolish as to burrow into that [[Old Core of Chu'ulel|bone-chilling well]] of yours.<br><br>
:CL-09: You...! You dare mock me, wretched worm!?<br><br>
:CL-08: Wherefore comes such ire, Thirteenth Lord? The ruler of Chichen Uctokah has spoken nothing but the truth. If humanity cannot be eradicated entirely, such drastic measures will only backfire in the end. Rather than pacifying them as you intend, you will only spur them on to cease their incessant infighting and unite against us. If that is your proposal, Fifth Lord, then for the future of our kind, I stand in firm opposition to such folly.<br><br>
:CL-07: Oh? The Priestess of Floral Candles and Skyborne Feathers would lecture us on "the future of our kind"? I remind you, Eighth Lord, that you hold no standing in this matter &mdash; for you have long since forsaken duty to your kin in favor of a misguided partiality for humanity. To this day, you have yet to explain why you employed dragon artisans of your domain to forge a [[Chain Breaker|longbow]] for your little [[Lianca|human pet]]. Was this not a blatant overstepping of your mandate?<br><br>
:CL-08: You stray from the topic, Seventh Lord. Furthermore, my actions were sanctioned by our [[Xiuhcoatl|Sovereign]], and I have never yet exceeded that mandate. I owe no explanations to the weak.<br><br>
:CL-12: You need not explain yourself to others, for already, I have grasped your full intent. Indeed, as the Eighth Lord has stated, such drastic measures can hardly be deemed efficient. Humanity should instead be manipulated into regulating their own numbers. We need only select and support certain individuals from the shadows, bestowing upon them the necessary resources and aid to seize power over their tribes. With such support, they can easily be shepherded into betraying their own kin &mdash; driven by their innate vanity and the need to secure their tenuous positions. Willingly they shall foment conflict with other tribes, spilling one another's blood and shattering whatever fragile trust may have existed between them. This alone shall suffice, so why go to unnecessary lengths and expend our own resources on a far less efficient plan?<br><br>
:CL-11: One might almost have mistaken such feeble words for the self-conceited ramblings of some human whelp, Twelfth Lord. Have you spent so much time among the fawning livestock in your domains that you have forgotten our way? Have you fallen so low as to measure your wit against insects, disdaining even to hunt them yourself?<br><br>
:CL-12: I have no interest in responding to your infantile insults, dear sister. Even the bestial hisses of those sunken degenerates, those mindless lizards who spend their lives groveling in the dust, have more worth than such senseless drivel. Of course, you may hunt as you will &mdash; that right is beyond dispute. However, out of genuine respect and concern for my brethren, I sincerely hope that you do not follow in the footsteps of the Sixth and Tenth Lords, who foolishly squandered their not-so-lofty lives out of sheer arrogance and folly.<br><br>
:CL-11: You&mdash;!<br><br>
:CL-01: Silence. All sovereign rulers present have spoken. The vote shall now be held.<br><br>

:CL-12 "Murmuring Spring" Ix Roq'ratik'obala' Ka'alahun<br><br>
:[Record Begins]<br>
:CL-01: I demand that you explain yourself immediately, Twelfth Lord. What is the meaning of this? Against all expectation, you would call for the execution of your own flesh and blood, and at such a critical hour?<br><br>
:CL-12: Venerable Speaker, what kind of an explanation do you wish for? The words I wish to speak &mdash; the words I must speak &mdash; have already been made clear in my proposal. I, Ix Roq'ratik'obala' Ka'alahun Ch'ule-L, custodian of Q'umqaraq'aj, accuse the Eighth Lord among us, Ix Ajkotz'i'j Iq'ismal Waxak Ch'ule-L, of betraying our kind, and thus request her immediate execution. Instead of pressing me yet again on matters you already know, why not first question the Eighth Lord herself to see what she might say in her own defense?<br><br>
:CL-08: I have no intention of defending myself. If any of you believe I have betrayed our kind and defiled our Sovereign's vision, then cast your vote for my execution. Only a weakling would waste words on such matters.<br><br>
:CL-12: How dignified your haughty grace, my dear sister. Yet as I see it, you are merely grasping for an excuse &mdash; one you cannot find &mdash; to explain your own betrayal. How else would you justify why the [[Lianca|human]] you keep &mdash; that vile reaver, that brazen harborer of degenerates we had exiled, that insect who dared trespass upon my domain whom you dare call "daughter," who wields a [[Chain Breaker|weapon]] forged by dragon-smiths &mdash; has chosen to follow in [[Xbalanque]]'s path, assisting him in slaughtering our kin? And why, even now, do you continue to tolerate her savagery rather than cast her out yourself? Is that not so, our ever-venerable Paragon Priestess of Floral Candles and Skyborne Feathers?<br><br>
:CL-08: You name me a traitor, Twelfth Lord. If I truly were one, you would now be lying at my feet, begging for mercy to save your pitiful life. As for my beloved daughter, you have no right to make such accusations. She has chosen her path, just as I have chosen to remain loyal to our Sovereign. If a weak worm like you cannot even kill her, or maintain the territory granted to you by our [[Xiuhcoatl|Sovereign]] &mdash; then that is your fault, neither mine nor hers.<br><br>
:CL-01: I, too, refute your accusation, Twelfth Lord. The human named Xbalanque is a powerful warrior, worthy of our respect. Even in my eyes, he has shown himself worthy of facing me in combat, and of my killing him in person. This is a fact that you should respect. That humanity's offspring would flock to his banner is as natural as the idea that a plant would turn towards the sun, or that its seeds would drift along with the wind. This stands beyond reproach, and certainly does not constitute treason.<br><br>
:CL-07: You would speak in puny humanity's defense?<br><br>
:CL-01: I have no intention of defending anyone, Seventh Lord. My words are crystal clear, surely as my teeth gleam with the brilliance of gemstones. I esteem the formidable enemy named Xbalanque, just as I long to tear open his chest in glorious battle, and to bathe my very heart in his blood out of respect for his nobility. If you would call this a defense, I would not mind so defending your honor either, Seventh Lord.<br><br>
:CL-07: ...I request your pardon. It was not my intent to provoke you.<br><br>
:CL-01: Such an outrageous proposal is itself an affront to the Chamber of Deliberation. I, too, do not consider following Xbalanque to be an unforgivable crime. Perhaps you should call for my execution as well?<br><br>
:CL-02: The Eighth Lord speaks the truth in this matter. If you cannot defeat even a puny human, Twelfth Lord, then truly you all deserve to perish.<br><br>
:CL-05: You would deny her betrayal too, Jade Maiden?<br><br>
:CL-02: I would not deign to label the Eighth Lord a traitor. Yet my regard for you, Eighth Lord, does not sway me sufficiently to reject this proposal either. Even if the possibility of your betrayal is but one in a hundred thousand, that sliver of corruption is enough to repulse me. Pure primal flame brooks not the slightest speck of impurity &mdash; and well you know this, too.<br><br>
:CL-08: I know that well, indeed. Were I in your position, Second Lord, my choice would be the same.<br><br>
:CL-02: Very well, then. You almost stir in me a pang of regret, Eighth Lord. In fact, perhaps I have already begun to feel it.<br><br>
