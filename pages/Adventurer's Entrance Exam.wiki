:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild. What kind of commission would you like to take on today?
:{{DIcon}} About the adventurers' ranking exams...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' You wish to take an exam? Please wait while I verify your adventure record and the status of your recent commissions...
:{{DIcon}} I wasn't asking for me...
:{{DIcon}} I meant Noelle...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Sorry, Ms. Katheryne. Actually, I am the one who wishes to take the exam...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Oh? Noelle... You are finally ready to join the Adventurers' Guild? Wonderful, I will process your application at once...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' No, no... I just want to take an exam for the experience...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Right now, I don't have any plan to become an adventurer... I'm sorry...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' I see... What a pity.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Our exams are only available to official members of the Guild. The content of each exam is determined based on the adventurer's individual experience and commission status. As such, I am unfortunately unable to arrange for you to have an exam.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 06.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' However... since you just want to experience what an exam is like, perhaps you can talk to Cyrus, the branch master?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 07.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' As it happens, he has recently been working on a new entrance exam for the Guild. It has not yet been approved for official use... Perhaps you could give it a trial run?
:{{DIcon}} Pretty sure there was no such exam when I first joined...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 08.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Indeed... Although, the entrance exam does have something to do with you joining the Guild...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 09.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' You can ask Branch Master Cyrus if you require more details. He should be at Angel's Share right now drafting a syllabus. He said he gets more "inspired" when he's there...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 katheryne 10.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' We don't yet know what's included in the syllabus. Others in the Guild have produced several drafts, but all of them were rejected by Cyrus...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' It sounds as if I'll have a good chance of running into something unexpected.
:{{DIcon}} Let's give it a try.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908501 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Yes, let's... I wonder what will be on the exam...

===Adventurer's Entrance Exam===
{{Quest Description|From Katheryne, you and Noelle learn that the Adventurers' Guild Branch Master, Cyrus, is currently working on an entrance exam for new adventurers.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Go to the Angel's Share and find Cyrus)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hunt down three Ruin Guards... Hmm, could it be a little too difficult? Ugh, what am I thinking, the newcomers will run a mile...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hunt down three boars in the forest... Nay, the Guild will never approve that...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh, it's you... and Noelle, I see...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Hello, Mr. Cyrus. Are you working on the exam syllabus? How is it coming along?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ugh, don't get me started... Since (Traveler) solved the Stormterror crisis and became Mondstadt's hero, a whole load of young people got excited and decided to join the Adventurers' Guild...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' But most of them have no experience at all. They can't even handle a single slime without getting all battered and bruised in the process. So, some genius in the Guild decided: Why don't we make an entrance exam? *sigh*
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' That sounds... like a good idea, no? This way, the adventurers won't get hurt so easily.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...Yes, but if the exam is too difficult, no one will want to join!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' A few scrapes and bruises is nothing a strong will can't compensate for! Why doesn't anyone else in the Guild understand this...?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 08.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Anyway, I already rejected two drafts, and now I am working on a third one myself. It's absolutely crucial that I get the difficulty level right...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 09.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' *sigh* If only someone could give it a test run... At least then I could decide where the upper limit of difficulty should be...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Then... Mr. Cyrus, may I give it a try?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I am very interested in... in experiencing the adventurer's entrance exam!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 10.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh? Noelle, you mean... you want to take the adventurer's entrance exam?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 11.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Haha! That's fantastic! Well, if it's you, Noelle... even with every challenge at the highest difficulty, you shouldn't have any problem at all.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Yes, please make sure they are the most difficult!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 12.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Excellent! That's the spirit of a true adventurer! Now, let me explain the rules of the exam.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 13.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' First, since adventurers often work in groups, you are welcome to invite others to assist you during the exam.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 14.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' If (Traveler) is willing, please join Noelle.
:{{DIcon}} So even at the highest difficulty, you can just get someone else to help...?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 15.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Indeed. Second, there are three parts to the exam, which are basic knowledge, survival skills, and a combat exercise.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 16.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You only need to pass two out of three parts to succeed in the exam... but of course, Noelle should find she has no trouble getting a perfect score.
:{{DIcon}} So you can still pass the exam even if you're no good at combat...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 17.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ahem... And finally, remember at all times that being an adventurer takes courage and resilience! Ad astra abyssosque!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Ad... Ad astra abyssosque...!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 18.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Haha, that's the spirit. Without further ado, let's start part one &mdash; basic knowledge.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 19.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' A true adventurer must be well-versed in all sorts of relevant knowledge to handle whatever may come their way.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 20.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' I will ask you three questions. You may discuss among yourselves first before giving me an answer.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 21.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Question one. An adventurer must be well acquainted with their environment to make sure they can obtain any resources they need.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 22.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Tell me, which of the following local specialties of Mondstadt cannot be found near {{Color|buzzword|Wolvendom}}? Dandelion Seeds, Calla Lilies, Windwheel Asters, or Small Lamp Grass?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Hmm, Wolvendom... I remember reading that there are [[Wolfhook]]s everywhere, but the book made no specific mention of any other plants...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 08.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Hmm... No, I must approach this question differently... Is there anything here that requires specific environmental conditions in order to grow? Conditions that {{Color|buzzword|Wolvendom}} cannot provide?
:{{DIcon}} [[Dandelion Seed]]s.
:{{DIcon}} [[Small Lamp Grass]].
:{{DIcon}} [[Calla Lily]].
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 24.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ooh, I'm afraid... That's the wrong answer...
:{{DIcon}} [[Windwheel Aster]].
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 09.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' That's it! The Windwheel Aster mostly grows in [[Stormterror's Lair]], at [[Windrise]], and near [[Statue of The Seven|Statues of The Seven]]. All the others are much more widely found...
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 10.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Mr. Cyrus, our answer is Windwheel Aster!
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 23.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Correct! There's no fooling you two, eh?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 25.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' On to question two. An adventurer must always learn from their experience and keep track of everything they encounter in the form of a diary.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 26.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' There is a famous adventurer who once went exploring all over Liyue, documenting his whole journey.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 27.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' {{Color|buzzword|Thanks to the [[Diary of Roald the Adventurer|notes]] he took of each location that he went}}, young adventurers are now able to plan ahead and avoid the dangers there. What is the name of this adventurer?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 11.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Learning from experience, writing diaries... It seems like adventuring requires constant self-reflection, just like studying.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 12.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Regarding this adventurer... I do believe I have read about him. He even made his mark on Dragonspine. Yes, it must be him... Hmm... Oh, what was his name...?
:{{DIcon}} Wilde.
:{{DIcon}} Sayid.
:{{DIcon}} Wyatt.
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 29.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ooh, what a pity... You were so close, but not quite close enough. Never mind, eh.
:{{DIcon}} [[Roald]].
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 13.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' That's it! It's Roald!
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 28.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Correct! I had thought this question would be a little more challenging to adventurers from Mondstadt. Once again, Noelle, you never fail to impress.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 30.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Last question. Let's have some fun with this one. The most terrifying domain for adventurers from Mondstadt, the infamous {{Color|buzzword|windless land}}...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 31.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' All that awaits you there is a sea of ashes and the deathly silence in the air... So, what is the name of this taboo territory?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 noelle 14.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' A sea of ashes... A windless land... What could it be...?
:{{DIcon}} Mare Safari.
:{{DIcon}} Jare Mivani.
:{{DIcon}} Mair Javiri.
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 33.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Wrong answer! Huh... Was that supposed to be some sort of joke?
:{{DIcon}} [[Mare Jivari]].
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908502 cyrus 32.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Correct! Keep this name in mind. Some day, you too will pass through this domain!
;(If answered all questions correctly)
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hahaha, that's three for three! As expected, these questions were no match for you.
;(If answered at least one question incorrectly)
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hmm... Are the questions too difficult? If even Noelle wasn't up to the task...
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Never mind, don't worry too much. This was just testing your rote learning ability, anyway. It wouldn't be much practical help on an adventure.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' But be warned, things start to get a little trickier in the survival skills test!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908503 cyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Now, go and prepare yourselves. Meet me at Good Hunter when you think you're ready.
----
{{Quest Description|After fully understanding Noelle's reasons for seeking him out, an elated and excited Cyrus decides to put you both through his new exam at the highest difficulty level.}}
;(Head to Good Hunter and talk to Cyrus)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Okay, let's begin with part two of the entrance exam.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Ready and willing, Mr. Cyrus.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Staying well-fed and making sure to prepare sufficient food supplies is a key survival skill for adventurers.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' That's why the second part of the exam is to prepare a food item fit for an emergency out in the wild. There are three criteria:
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Firstly, the ingredients must be easily accessible in the wilderness.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Secondly, preparation and cooking must be quick and easy.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Thirdly... Well, the food item in question must be able to help someone in dire straits to bounce back from the brink and regain their strength!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 cyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' So go ahead, cook something full of passion and packed with flavor! Just bring it to me whenever it's ready. Noelle... I await your dish with the greatest anticipation! Haha!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Hmm... {{Color|buzzword|simple ingredients, easy to cook, helps you rally}}...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' (Traveler), do you have any idea?
:{{DIcon}} Emergency Food.
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Emergency Food...? Though I have never tried any, it doesn't sound like a specific dish... Let's think of something else.
:{{DIcon}} Mondstadt Grilled Fish.
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Mondstadt Grilled Fish... You have a point. All it needs is a fish fillet and some pepper.
:{{DIcon}} Steak.
::{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Steak? Good point! In a real emergency, all you'd need is a piece of meat... you wouldn't even need any seasoning.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Okay then. Once it's ready, let's take it over to Mr. Cyrus.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908601 noelle 08.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' We can always change our minds if we have a better idea. One must be careful not to act too hastily when taking an exam.

;(Talk to Cyrus and give him the dish that meets his requirements)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...Oh, you're ready to go? Don't be too hasty, now. You still have time to prepare, use it wisely.
:;(If you give him Mondstadt Grilled Fish)
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' *sniff* Mondstadt Grilled Fish, if I'm not mistaken? The fragrance is certainly rather rejuvenating.
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' So... Mondstadt Grilled Fish... is the correct answer?
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Well, uh, the issue is... many people can't eat fish that hasn't been seasoned with plenty of pepper.
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' I, for one, am quite happy to eat it straight from the grill with no seasoning at all... But basically, I think there are more straightforward dishes available.
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908603 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Oh, I see... I'm sorry, I didn't take that into consideration...
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ah, don't get down in the dumps! I've saved the best part of the exam for last.
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908603 cyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Go get yourself ready and meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.
:;(If you give him Steak)
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Steak! Steak! Hahaha, hands down the top choice of a true adventurer!
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Simple ingredients, high nutritious, and most importantly, all you need to cook it is an open flame!
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Mm... And when it's not an emergency, adding a bit of seasoning makes it even better. Succulent and juicy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside... The perfect accompaniment to an alcoholic beverage...
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Really?
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908602 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' If you like it so much, I can always make a few more!
:::{{DIcon}} This was all a ploy to get Noelle to cook some drunk food for you...
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ahaha, not at all! I was merely contemplating having a celebratory libation on Noelle's behalf.
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' In any case, congratulation on passing part two of the exam! Up next is the final stage.
:::{{A|vo noecop002 1908602 cyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Go get yourself ready, then meet me at Brightcrown Canyon.
----
;(Talk to Cyrus at Brightcrown Canyon)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ad astra abyssosque, and welcome to the third and final part of your exam. Are you ready?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908701 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Please... begin. I am ready.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Good! Now. The most important skillset for an adventurer is, of course... combat skills!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ferocious monsters, dangerous machines... Only in the heat of the battle against your enemy does that surge of adrenaline really kick in!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' This is the last part of the exam... Defeat the nearby Ruin Guard {{Color|buzzword|as quickly as you can}}.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' I will be watching from here. Give it all you've got, Noelle!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908701 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Okay! This time... I am confident I will pass!

;(Talk to Cyrus again)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908701 cyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Go for it, Noelle! Remember, keep track of your time!

;(After defeating opponent within the time limit)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' *catches breath*
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Honorary Knight! I did it!
:{{DIcon}} This is all the result of your hard work.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Not entirely... whenever I've taken an exam in the past, I always get nervous and I can't control it.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I know that it's just like in training, but I always end up worrying I might fail...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' But not this time... This time, it seems I was able to remain calm.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Somehow, having you by my side is... soothing...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' It must be because you are here with me that I was able to complete the exam.
:{{DIcon}} No, Noelle. It's because you have what it takes.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 08.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Thank you, thank you...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 09.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' ...On the day of the real exam, if &mdash; and I mean only if...
:{{DIcon}} I will have time.
:{{DIcon}} I will be there.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908704 noelle 10.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Great! Maybe, just maybe, things will be different this time...
;(Talk to Cyrus)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Oh, back already? Seems like...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Even the third part of the exam is a walk in the park for you!

;(Failed to defeat opponent within the time limit)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Ohhhh....
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' In the end, I... I couldn't do it...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' My palms were sweating, and my heart was racing, and...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I know that it's just like in training, but still, I always end up worrying I might fail...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' And in the end, I couldn't even solve the problem at hand...
:{{DIcon}} It's not because you lack the ability...
:{{DIcon}} It's because you were too fixated on the formality of the exam...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' But if I cannot perform well in an exam, what good is my ability...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908705 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' *sigh* Maybe... I should train some more...

{{Dialogue start}}
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Now, please allow me to announce the results of your adventurer's entrance examination...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...You passed with a perfect score! Noelle, you are incredible, as always!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' It's all because... I had an Honorary Knight by my side...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Without further ado, it gives me great pleasure to officially grant you the title of adventurer!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 07.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' May your days ahead be filled with adventure, and may you boldly explore the stars above and the abyss below! Ad astra abyssosque! Hahaha!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 08.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' My, my, I never thought I'd see the day when Noelle would finally come around to the idea of joining the Adventurers' Guild...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Oh &mdash; oh Mr. Cyrus, I... I'm terribly sorry, but actually, I...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 09.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' There's no need to talk like an outsider anymore! From now on, you can call me Branch Master, and I will call you Adventurer!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I'm very sorry, but... I actually wasn't planning to join the Adventurers' Guild at all.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I just wanted to take an exam, so I could get used to the atmosphere... I thought it might help me better prepare for the Knights of Favonius selection exam.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 10.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Ah? You mean...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 11.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' How... How can this be? I was just about to recommend you to the perfect Adventure Team...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 12.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Wh&mdash;Why not give it some more thought? Even if you're not ready to be a full-time adventurer, you'd be more than welcome to help out every now and then.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 13.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Just think of it as, uh... Ah, yes, think of it as part of your exam preparation!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 14.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You know, if you think about it, adventurers have a lot in common with the Knights.... both want to defend Mondstadt!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' ...Exam preparation? ...Defend Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 15.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Yes, precisely! I assure you it won't take up too much of your time. I believe it's only around four commissions per day...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Four commissions... M&mdash;Maybe if I can squeeze out some time from my breaks...
:{{DIcon}} Noelle, stay strong!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Argh, if I'm not careful the urge to accommodate just takes over...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 08.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I'm sorry, Mr. Cyrus. But I'm afraid that my answer is still&mdash;
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 16.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Please, Noelle! I'm begging you, we need your help!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 09.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Ooh, uhh... Well, if my assistance is required...
:{{DIcon}} Noelle, let's go back and do some studying!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 10.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Ohh... Okay! Sorry, Mr. Cyrus, maybe next time!

:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Now, please allow me to announce the results of your adventurer's entrance examination...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 17.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...You successfully passed the exam! And you were so close to getting a perfect score... It feels like a missed opportunity...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 18.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' But... if even Noelle could not get a perfect score, then maybe... I still need to adjust the difficulty level a little further...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 19.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Yes, the barrier to entry must be lowered to cater to the newcomers, then we can raise the difficulty at a later stage... Only in this way can we successfully attract newcomers...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 11.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I... I didn't get a perfect score...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 20.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hey now, first things first! Allow me to congratulate you on what was nevertheless a sterling performance in your exam! I will have Katheryne handle the admission process for you right away...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 21.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Uhh... Noelle?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 12.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' ...Where did I go wrong? Is there any hope for me to improve? If I could start over...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 13.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Oh, I'm sorry... Mr. Cyrus, what were you saying just now? I was a little lost in my own thoughts...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 22.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Huh... I was about to ask whether you would have the time to visit the Guild with me...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 14.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I do apologize, Mr. Cyrus... I must get back to my exam preparation.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 15.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' If I don't review my mistakes, I will only repeat them the next time I run into the same problem...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 16.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' It seems... I still have lots to learn...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 noelle 17.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I will head back to the library now, and continue studying!
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 23.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' N&mdash;Noelle? You... you already passed your exam. What do you need to study for? Sure, you made a few mistakes, but this is an overreaction...
:{{DIcon}} Here's the situation...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 24.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' ...I see. *sigh* Well, (Traveler), when you get back, would you mind going to the library and checking on Noelle?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 25.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' I hope my exam hasn't affected her mood...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908801 cyrus 26.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' How can I get the exam to the right difficulty level? Hmm... I should go back to the Angel's Share and give this some careful consideration over an alcoholic beverage...

;(Return to the library and find Noelle)
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' *dozing off*
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Mustn't... fall... asleep
:{{DIcon}} Noelle... Are you okay?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Ah... sorry, I zoned out a little... I didn't notice you there...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I've summarized my experiences from the mock exam and created a new reading list...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' "Getting to Know Mondstadt's Geography" and "A One-Minute History of Adventuring in Mondstadt"... There is so much I can learn from them.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Then there's "Eating Well in Mondstadt"... I never realized there were so many ways to cook in the wild.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' And also "Self Defense: The Art of Down-to-Earth Dialogue With Monsters"... The combat approach of adventurers is definitely worth further study.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 08.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' The only thing is... There is so much to get through. Will I really be able to finish them all?
:{{DIcon}} Surely these topics won't be covered in the Knights' selection exam?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 09.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' But, but... what if this is the one time they do come up? What then?
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 10.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' What if they ask me... How to rescue an adventurer... Or how best to collaborate with the Adventurers' Guild...
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 11.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' If I neglect these topics now... I may live to regret it later.
:{{A|vo noecop002 1908902 noelle 12.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' *sigh* It looks like every second I have between now and my exam is going to count.

====Noelle's Study Notes====
{{Dialogue start}}
:{{DIcon}} Noelle's Study Notes
:'''Noelle's Study Notes:''' "Windwheel Asters commonly found at Stormterror's Lair and Windrise," "Hit Ruin Guards in weak spots to gain upper hand"...
:'''Noelle's Study Notes:''' Each and every new detail learned during the adventure is recorded in neat and tidy handwriting &mdash; though it starts to get messier as you go down the page.
:'''Noelle's Study Notes:''' Some vague descriptions are closely followed by precise annotations adding further detail. This seems to be evidence of the writer fighting a valiant battle against sleepiness.
