::'''Shadi:''' Haven't you heard? He's famous among us merchants! [[Dori|Lord Sangemah Bay]]!

::'''Shadi:''' Look at this batch of rugs I've got. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to sell them because of the quality and high cost.
::'''Shadi:''' But the lord said not to worry and that I'd make a good deal, so I was bold and asked for the price I wanted.
::'''Shadi:''' And the result was solid. I made a good profit even after paying a high trade fee!
