{{Quest Description|You meet two children playing at the Fleuve Cendre...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Verut or Aurele)
:'''Verut:''' You won't find the hiding spot I picked this time!
:'''Aurele:''' If you hide in those places, it'll be your parents who come looking for you, not me.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:'''Verut:''' I'm playing hide-and-seek with my brother! Trouble is... Well, he knows all my hiding spots...
:'''Aurele:''' Verut, we've been playing here for so long that you've hidden everywhere there is to hide.
:'''Aurele:''' As for those places where you can't hide... If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times why you can't go there.
:'''Verut:''' Oh, those places aren't that dangerous! Mom and Dad exaggerate way too much!
:'''Aurele:''' But when you hide in those places, your clothes and pants will get dirty or torn. Mom and Dad work hard enough already, so don't give them one extra thing to worry about.
:'''Verut:''' Oh... Alright...
:{{DIcon}} Why don't I join in?
:{{DIcon}} Well, I might not be able to find you.
:'''Verut:''' Really? You wanna play with me?
:'''Aurele:''' Verut, don't make trouble for others! Sorry, all my brother ever thinks about is playing...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I've got time.
:{{DIcon}} It's alright. You're not bothering me.
:'''Verut:''' Awesome! See, brother? {{MC|m=He|f=She}} agreed! I'll definitely hide better than you, just watch!
:'''Aurele:''' *sigh* Alright then. In that case, we'll be counting on you.
:'''Aurele:''' Verut, don't hide in those places I told you about, alright? If our parents get back &mdash; they're getting back late today &mdash; and see your clothes all tattered, no one's gonna help you patch them up.
:'''Verut:''' Got it, I got it... Ugh, you're such a nag! I'm gonna go hide now. You hide too, quickly!
:'''Aurele:''' You go first. I already know where I'm hiding.
:'''Verut:''' Really? You're bragging, I know it! {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s gonna find you for sure!
:{{Black Screen|Aurele and Verut hide in their respective spots...}}

;(Approach Aurele)
:'''Aurele:''' I hope Verut will enjoy himself.

;(Talk to Aurele near Crossa<!--unsure if he is always there-->)
:'''Aurele:''' When will Verut grow up... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} Not hiding?
:'''Aurele:''' I never really intended to. If Verut didn't bother me as often as he does, I would prefer to read my books for a while more.
:'''Aurele:''' Our parents work so hard, so I've got to grow up fast and help lighten their load.
:'''Aurele:''' But Verut keeps saying that he misses Mom, so I have to accompany him. That way, he'll stop crying for a bit.
:'''Aurele:''' Sorry, I've said too much. I'll be waiting at our meeting spot.
:'''Aurele:''' I can only hope that Verut won't dirty his clothes this time...

;(Approach Verut)
:'''Verut:''' Can't find me...

;(Talk to Verut)
:'''Verut:''' Whoa! You found me! Did my brother tell you about this spot!?
:'''Verut:''' Bah, alright, guess you're pretty good at this. I'm going to our meeting place.

;(After finding both Aurele and Verut)
:'''Verut:''' Hey! Did you tell {{MC|m=him|f=her}} about my spot? How did {{MC|m=he|f=she}} find me that quickly?
:'''Aurele:''' I've told you this before. Your hiding spots are way too obvious.
:{{DIcon}} Experience is on my side, I fear.
:{{DIcon}} I'm very good at hide-and-seek.
:'''Verut:''' Really? In that case, will you come over next time too? Could we play together again?
:'''Verut:''' Our parents aren't at home in the day, and my big brother's always reading... No one has time to play...
:'''Aurele:''' Well, you can do what I do and read the books on the shelves. That's a lot more useful than playing hide-and-seek.
:'''Verut:''' Well... I'd rather go look for Mom and learn sewing from her...
