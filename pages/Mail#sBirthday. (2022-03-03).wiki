I don't remember what my last wish was. It should have come true, right?

It's hard to think of something to wish for.

I don't want anything big, or many things. As long as it's something I can touch, that's fine.

I want to feed the [[:Category:Finches|finches]] with you.

I have already prepared the seeds.
