}}{{Description|Abyss creatures that utilise Electro in battles. While studying at the Academia, researcher Alva Nikola once conducted a systematic study of the methods by which Electro Abyss Mage manipulate Electro and came up with a theoretical weapon known as the Nikola Coil. However, it has yet to be put into practice. Some say that his research materials were eaten during a fungal infestation.|[[Archive]]}}

==Stats==
{{Enemy Stats|hp_ratio=2|atk_ratio=3|hp_type=1}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*The '''Electro Abyss Mage''' has these unique properties compared to its counterparts:
**Prioritizes '''Special Attacks''' over '''Normal Attacks'''.
**When using '''Teleportation''' in its shielded state, reappears extremely close to the target.
*'''Electro Shield:''' Upon initiating combat, the Electro Abyss Mage immediately gains an {{Electro}} [[Shields|Shield]], protecting it from damage. The shield takes damage from certain [[Elemental Reactions]] and suffers additional damage based on the strength of the attacks it receives.
*'''Normal Attack:''' Shoots an Electro projectile at the target, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}
*'''Special Attack: Electro Ring:''' Summons a large Electro ring around itself and deals one instance of '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to targets anywhere inside the ring's AoE. Afterwards, the ring itself will deal '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to targets upon contact.
*'''Teleportation:''' If the target is too far from the mage, it clutches its mask and teleports directly in front of the target, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} at its location upon reappearance. The mage can also teleport away from the player to avoid attacks when vulnerable.
*'''Revival:''' If the mage is left alone after its shield is destroyed, repeatedly shoots out 4 medium-sized orbs in different directions around it, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. During this attack, the mage's [[Interruption Resistance]] is increased. If the mage is not staggered or defeated within 10 seconds, it regains an Electro Shield, dealing '''150% ATK''' and '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.
*'''Enhancement:''' Certain enhanced Electro Abyss Mages can be found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges. There are 2 possible types of enhancements: Attack and Shield.
**'''Attack Enhancement:''' While using '''Teleportation''', automatically generates an '''Electro Ring''' upon reappearance.
**'''Shield Enhancement:''' The '''Electro Shield''' becomes twice as durable. When a character's attack hits the shield, 1 [[gauge unit]] of Electro will be applied to the character.

==Strategy==
*{{Pyro}} and {{Cryo}} attacks are both the most effective at destroying the {{Electro}} shield by triggering [[Overloaded]] and [[Superconduct]] respectively.
*{{Hydro}} attacks can deal continuous but low damage to the Electro shield by causing the [[Electro-Charged]] reaction.
*As Electro Abyss Mages deal {{Color|Electro DMG}}, any active characters may take increased damage if they are currently affected by {{Hydro}}, {{Cryo}} or {{Pyro}}, causing the Electro-Charged, Superconduct and Overloaded reactions respectively against the active character. Electro-Charged deals continuous damage; Superconduct and Overloaded deal an instance of damage.
*Abyss Mages have no innate elemental resistance to their corresponding element while unshielded. Electro attacks against the mage during this state will be just as effective as any other element.

==Trivia==
*Alva Nikola and the Nikola Coil mentioned in the Electro Abyss Mage's description is a reference to {{w|Nikola Tesla}} and the {{w|Tesla coil}}.
