}}{{Description|Abyss creatures that utilize Electro in battles.<br />While studying at the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]], researcher [[Alva Nikola]] once conducted a systematic study of the methods by which Electro Abyss Mages manipulate Electro and came up with a theoretical weapon known as the Nikola Coil. However, it has yet to be put into practice. Some say that his research materials were eaten during a fungal infestation.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''
{{Enemy Attacks
|desc_1 = The Electro Abyss Mage has the following unique properties compared to its counterparts:
* Prioritizes '''Special Attacks''' over '''Normal Attacks'''.
* When using '''Teleportation''' in its shielded state, reappears extremely close to the target.

|name_2 = Electro Shield
|desc_2 = Upon initiating combat, the Electro Abyss Mage immediately gains an {{Electro}} [[Shield]], protecting it from damage. The shield takes damage from certain [[Elemental Reactions]] and suffers additional damage based on the strength of the attacks it receives.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Electro|8}}
|strat_2 = {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, and {{Dendro}} attacks are both the most effective at destroying the {{Electro}} shield by triggering [[Overloaded]], [[Superconduct]], and [[Quicken]] respectively.

|name_3 = Normal Attack
|desc_3 = Shoots an Electro projectile at the target, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}
|file_3 = Electro Abyss Mage Normal Attack

|name_4 = Special Attack: Electro Ring
|desc_4 = Summons a large Electro ring around itself and deals one instance of '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to targets anywhere inside the ring's AoE. Afterwards, the ring itself will deal '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to targets upon contact.
|file_4 = Electro Abyss Mage Special Attack

|name_5 = Teleportation
|desc_5 = If the target is too far from the mage, it clutches its mask and teleports directly in front of the target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} at its location upon reappearance. The mage can also teleport away from the player to avoid attacks when vulnerable.

|name_6 = Rite of the Radiant Lightning
|desc_6 = If the mage is left alone after its shield is destroyed, repeatedly shoots out 4 medium-sized orbs in different directions around it, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. During this attack, the mage's [[Interruption Resistance]] is increased. If the mage is not staggered or defeated within 10 seconds, it regains an Electro Shield, dealing '''120% ATK''' and '''160% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

|name_7 = Enhancement
|desc_7 = Certain enhanced Electro Abyss Mages can be found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges. There are 2 possible types of enhancements: Attack and Shield.
* '''Attack Enhancement:''' While using '''Teleportation''', automatically generates an '''Electro Ring''' upon reappearance.
* '''Shield Enhancement:''' The '''Electro Shield''' becomes twice as durable. When a character's attack hits the shield, 1 [[gauge unit]] of Electro will be applied to the character.
}}

==Trivia==
*Alva Nikola and the Nikola Coil mentioned in the Electro Abyss Mage's description is a reference to {{w|Nikola Tesla}} and the {{w|Tesla coil}}.
