::'''Yelafath:''' Thanks to them, business is pretty good! If your rod's broken, I can help fix it as well!
::'''Yelafath:''' I'm quite good at handicrafts, so I also sell small badges and ornaments.
::'''Yelafath:''' Many tourists {{sic|went}} to bring some souvenirs back, so I do custom work as well &mdash; if you want to engrave a name or something like that, I can do it, easy!
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
