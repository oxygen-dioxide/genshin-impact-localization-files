|text    = In recent years, I usually spend my birthday with Lord [[Kamisato Ayato|Ayato]] and Lady [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]].

But this morning, my lord asked me if I had other plans today... Honestly, I wanted to meet up with you.

Lately, I've been worried that you haven't been taking good care of yourself on your journey. As I walk around [[Ritou]], [[Mondstadt]] occasionally comes to mind. There are many reasons, but ultimately... It's because I want to see you.

Tell me where I can find you!

Oh, that's right, leave dinner plans to me. Don't worry about it.

I'm on top of my game today and I'm sure you'll be well satisfied. If there's anything else you need, just let me know. Don't be a stranger! I'll be sure to bring everything along!
