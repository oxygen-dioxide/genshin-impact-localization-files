==Description==
A nimble sword with holes and delicate engravings on the blade. The sword once made the sound of a flute when wielded by one with the requisite skill. The pitch and tone were determined by the swinging angle.<br>
This sword was buried when the [[Wanderer's Troupe (Faction)|Wanderer's Troupe]] disbanded. Unearthed years later, it has long since lost its ability to sing.<br>
Even so, it still makes for a lethal weapon.

Among the members of the Wanderer's Troupe was a valiant sword-wielding dancer.<br>
After the Troupe's attempt to tear down the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy|ruling class]] failed, she was enslaved as a gladiator.

Though all her hope and all her companions were lost, still she fought bravely.<br>
Her sword sang with the radiance of the morn's light, and she was dubbed the "[[Dawnlight Swordswoman]]."

In his youth, the Dawn Knight [[Ragnvindr]] was in the retinue of a knight.<br>
He went with his master to watch a gladiator match, and was moved by the Dawnlight Swordswoman's splendid finale.<br>
He named himself the Dawn Knight in her honor, and knew in his heart what he must do next.
