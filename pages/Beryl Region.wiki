{{Dialogue Start}}
:"Discovered an ancient ruin that remains unmarked on any map. The entrance has completely collapsed. If I manage to find a way in, I may discover some rare treasure..."
:"Convincing everyone that whatever's in there is gonna be worth our while was tough going... The next part's gonna be a walk in the park by contrast. There's no need to keep a low profile here..."
:"Didn't find aught else but this arcane formation and the peculiar barriers around it, and after all that effort, too..."
:"There seems to be someone trapped inside the barriers... Can't tell if they are alive or not. Well, I'm not going back empty-handed, not after how far I've gone. That's just not my style..."
:(The remaining pages are filled with black stains, making the text unreadable.)

==Descriptions==
{{Description|An ancient ruin-studded mountain range across the water from the [[Court of Fontaine]].<br>Many, many centuries ago, the followers of [[Egeria]] once saw this place as a prime location for excursions and picnics. Gathered here, they sang of love and dreams as pure and stainless as polished gems. Their songs have long faded into the pale moonlight, and now, only cool breezes continue to caress these lonely, mint-studded highlands.|[[Expedition]] description}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The Beryl Region may be named after the mineral of the same name. Well-known varieties of {{w|beryl}} include {{w|emerald}} and {{w|aquamarine (gem)|aquamarine}}. The [[Beryl Conch]] is also likely named after this.
