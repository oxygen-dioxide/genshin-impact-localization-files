|description = The Brown Deer is a creature with a reddish-brown body, but its fiery passion is only shown when wrestling with its own kind. Under most circumstances, this animal is peaceful and will not attack other creatures without good reason.<br>The iconic antlers of the Brown Deer are a symbol of the individual's strength. Generally speaking, the larger the antlers of a male deer, the greater the power they contain and the more authority they have in the herd. And the people of Natlan, who live in harmony with the Brown Deer, will hang ornaments such as ribbons and firefly lamps from the antlers to make them still more magnificent...
