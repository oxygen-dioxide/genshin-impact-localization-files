===About Miss Kozue===
:'''Message:''' "[[Kozue|Ms. Kozue]] of the [[Komore Teahouse]] is very lovely."
:'''Message:''' "Although she has a sharp tongue, a bad temper, and it really hurts when she hits you with the back of her sword..."
:'''Message:''' "But she is really lovely."
:'''Reply:''' The local Police Station has already opened a file based on a lawsuit lodged by Miss Kozue. Please report any leads that you may have.
:'''Reply:''' This message will be used for handwriting recognition. Removing or defiling it is prohibited.

===Grand Narukami Shrine Notice: Food Aid===
:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' With the permission of Guuji [[Yae Miko]], the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Faction)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] will provide help to those businesses and families affected by the war in the form of aid loans and food aid.
:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' We ask that those in need of help visit the [[Kamisato Clan]] to file the required paperwork.
:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' As the war continues and public funds become more tight, food aid will be reduced by half. We apologize for any inconvenience.
:'''Message:''' "I'd just like to say a big thank you to Lady Yae and the [[Kamisato Ayato|Yashiro Commissioner]] for their consideration. It's just that there are way too many people here everyday for food aid..."
:'''Message:''' "People are not receiving the daily allotment of food aid that they are supposed to. What should we do..."
:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' I am sorry, but we don't have a better way. Lady Yae and the Commissioner are doing their best to handle the situation.

===Grand Narukami Shrine Notice: Yae Publishing House===
:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' "The [[Yae Publishing House]]'s reader's forum will take place as planned. All are welcome, regardless of whether they come from territories controlled by the [[Shogunate]] or the [[Watatsumi Army|rebels]]!"
:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' Even though the ongoing war is a bitter one, Lady [[Yae Miko]] ensures equal treatment for all on account of sharing a common hobby.
:'''Reply:''' As a major publishing house, isn't welcoming rebels to a leisure activity a bit much?
:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' So long as our great [[Raiden Shogun|Shogun]] doesn't forbid it, then it's perfectly fine. Shouldn't the [[Tenryou Commission]] refrain from making controversial remarks?
:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' Besides, it seems a little out of order to label those who merely live under the dictatorship of the rebels "traitors."

===Tenryou Notice: Posting Notices===
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Please do not post notices everywhere!
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Anyone found posting notices without authorization will be punished!

===Tenryou Notice: Vision Hunt Decree===
{{Transclude|Ritou Harbor Bulletin Board|Tenryou Notice: Vision Hunt Decree}}

===Tenryou Notice: Fight Against Rebels===
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' The fight against the rebels proceeds apace. Only one more strike, and they shall be destroyed completely.
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' We hope that all young samurai will join together and fight to accomplish this great work!
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Come join the army! Or you may regret not having done anything for your country when the war is over!
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Please visit the [[Tenryou Commission]] for information about joining the army.
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Attention! Families that have received draft orders must send at least one adult to join the military.
:'''Message:''' "This war is a monster that devours people..."
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' What right do those who haven't joined the army have to criticize the war effort? It's because the rebels have been defeated that you are able to sit here and whine!
:'''Message:''' "Is that so? My husband wounded my younger brother on [[Yashiori Island]]. He may never walk again."
:'''Message:''' "I haven't heard anything from my husband since then... Perhaps he was killed by some rebel? And who's to say that that rebel was never once an honorable samurai?"
:'''Message:''' "Forgive me, but I do not see the point of this war. I will no longer send people to join the army."
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Just because these posts are anonymous doesn't mean you are free to spread slander. Such anti-war sentiment is naught but part of the [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya]] rebel's propaganda campaigns!
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Defacing of military draft notices is prohibited! Anyone caught will face severe punishment!

===About Kamisato Ayato===
:'''Message:''' "I visited [[Kamisato Ayato]] earlier and was surprised at how young he is."
:'''Message:''' "Compared to his sister [[Kamisato Ayaka]], he is a lot more determined and mature. With a family head like him, the [[Kamisato Clan|Kamisato]] clan surely has a bright future."
:'''Reply:''' "Thank you for your kind words about my brother."

===War Stories===
:'''Message:''' "I have taken a short break from the frontline on [[Yashiori Island]] to come home. My parents seem to have gotten a lot older, while my wife looks very exhausted."
:'''Message:''' "I feel very guilty about not spending more time with my family because of the war..."
:'''Message:''' "Inazuma seems to have become a lot more quiet. Friends who used to be talkative are now mostly silent."
:'''Message:''' "Strange. I thought my family would enjoy the war stories that I had sent home."

===Arataki "The Strongest" Itto===
:'''[[Arataki Itto|Arataki "The Strongest" Itto]]:''' "[[Kujou Sara|Kujou Tengu]]! I'm here on the Commercial Street. Stop hiding!"
:'''Arataki "The Strongest" Itto:''' "Crawl out of whatever hole you're in and fight me fair and square!"
:'''Arataki "The Strongest" Itto:''' "This one's for taking my [[Vision]] away! An eye for an eye!"
:'''Reply:''' Everyone, no need to worry! This fellow is just a small-time hooligan.
:'''Reply:''' Madam Kujou Sara promises that she has nothing to do with this person and that she will handle these messages immediately.

===Ogura Textiles & Kimonos===
:'''Message:''' "Due to the current situation, [[Ogura Textiles & Kimonos]] is going through some tough times. We can't just sit here and do nothing."
:'''Message:''' "[[Ogura Mio|Miss Ogura]]'s father was once a relative of the [[Kujou Clan]]. If we don't help each other, that would put the samurai name to shame."
:'''Message:''' "Please don't worry, Miss Ogura. We'll round up some old friends, and we'll help you get through this tough time."
:'''Reply to Message:''' "I really appreciate your kindness on my late father's account, but I am afraid I must decline."
:'''Reply to Message:''' "I don't want to trouble everyone over such a small matter. I am sure that my [[Ogura Yuu|brother]] and I can make it through."
:'''Message:''' "Miss Ogura, you really are just like your father."

===Outlanders in Ritou===
:'''Message:''' "If it were up to me, I would expel all the outlanders in [[Ritou]]!"
:'''Message:''' "The war just won't end, and the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] remains in effect. I find it hard to believe that the outlanders have no hand in this at all!"
:'''Message:''' "Those outlanders must have some way of smuggling [[Visions]] and rebels into our country..."
:'''Message:''' "If only we could make the [[Sakoku Decree]] more strict. All these problems would be gone!"
:'''Reply:''' Please don't spread rumors and defame outlanders!
:'''Reply:''' The Vision Hunt Decree and the suppression of the rebels are also going very smoothly!

===Superiors===
:'''Message:''' "Despite this long period of peace, it seems that few are altogether willing to fight on behalf of our lords..."
:'''Message:''' "But if the eldest son of [[Kujou Takayuki|Lord Kujou]] is already on the frontline, then what have we to complain about?"
:'''Message:''' "And I've heard that [[Kujou Masahito|Lord Masahito]] is an honorable man who looks after his soldiers. I wish I could be assigned to his command."
:'''Message:''' "Madam [[Kujou Sara]] is also a good commander... although she is famously strict with her soldiers, at least she is fair and no selfish motives."
:'''Message:''' "Leaders like them are rare in the [[Tenryou Commission]]..."
:'''Message:''' "I will stop talking about my superiors now, I think. Dear parents, please don't worry. I will come home triumphant soon, and I will bring our family honor!"

===Shogun's Decisions===
:'''Message:''' "I am about to leave my parents and sister. Though I come from a martial family, the thought of war still makes me uneasy."
:'''Message:''' "Is the war really necessary? Will [[Raiden Shogun|Her Excellency the Ogosho]] really take responsibility for the war and for every one of us?"
:'''Message:''' "As a samurai, perhaps now is not the time for doubt."
:'''Reply:''' A samurai should never have cold feet before a battle, nor should they doubt our Shogun's decisions.
:'''Reply:''' I urge you to turn yourself in for posting inappropriate messages in public. You will receive a lighter sentence of detainment and re-education.
:'''Reply:''' Removing or defiling this message is prohibited.

===Tenryou Notice: Suspicious Outlanders===

{{Transclude|Ritou Harbor Bulletin Board|Hiratsuka's Message}}

===General Gorou===
:'''Message:''' "General [[Gorou]] was here."
:'''Reply:''' Please don't make such terrible jokes!

===Military Strategy Dojo===
:'''Message:''' "I, [[Tatsunosuke]], hereby announce that the military strategy dojo will be permanently shut down starting today."
:'''Message:''' "The Path of the Sword is an art meant to protect others. It should not be used to kill our brothers."
:'''Message:''' "Lately, I have witnessed a lot of my disciples fighting against each other. Though I am no saint, my conscience was still pricked by it."
:'''Message:''' "It's time to put a stop to all this."
:'''Message:''' "This is why I am shutting the military strategy dojo down, and why I shall never reopen it. I've also forbidden my disciples from serving the [[Kujou Clan]]."

===General Gorou II===
:'''Message:''' "General [[Gorou]] was here again."
:'''Reply:''' Ah, to think that I was not present to receive such fine guests from faraway Watatsumi. You have my most sincere apologies for my failings.
:'''Message:''' "Uh, wow, that's kinda formal... How am I supposed to reply?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Eh, you can just take that to be the [[Narukami Island|Narukami]] way. All roundabout and longwinded-like, not like us [[Watatsumi Island|Watatsumi]] folk!"
:'''Reply:''' What that guy above means is: None of my business.

===Grand Narukami Shrine Notice: Post-War Counseling===

:'''Grand Narukami Shrine Notice:''' Additionally, the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] will hold sharing sessions for samurai who took part in the war and their families to help heal the traumas caused by the war.
:'''Message:''' "Thank you, Lady [[Yae Miko|Miko]], for your painstaking efforts, but I fear that some of our hurts may never be healed."
:'''Reply:''' It is "companionship" that gives "eternity" meaning. The past may have been cruel, but the future shall be longer still.
:'''Reply:''' It is alright to harbor inescapable hurts, for in this, no one is forever alone.
:'''Reply:''' In my own name and that of the Grand Narukami Shrine, I, Yae Miko, await your arrival.

===Kamisato Clan===
:'''Message:''' "The Kamisato siblings of the [[Yashiro Commission]] have been in higher spirits lately."
:'''Message:''' "It seems that the recent changes have seen the [[Kamisato Clan]]'s prestige grow significantly. I suppose that's the unpredictability of life for you, huh?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Ah, are you feeling a little sour about our [[Kamisato Ayato|Commissioner]]'s rise, my friend?"
:'''Reply:''' "No, no, I wouldn't dare... I'm just saying that it's going to be tough times for the other two major [[Tri-Commission|Commissions]]."

===Kujou Clan===
:'''Message:''' "The previous [[Kujou Takayuki|Clan Head]] was remiss in his duties, resulting in a crisis for the clan. But thanks to [[the Shogun]]'s clemency, the clan was spared capital punishment."
:'''Message:''' "As such, we retainers of the [[Kujou Clan]] have in turn been spared the agony of watching this venerable house's extinction. We must redouble our efforts from this day forth to atone for our failures..."
:'''Message:''' "We must support Young Masters [[Kujou Kamaji]] and [[Kujou Masahito]] in setting our affairs in order and in defending the reign of our Almighty Shogun."

===Missing Person Poster===
:'''Missing Person Poster:''' I'm searching for my husband, [[Inaba Kyuuzou|Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou]]. He is a tall man without any facial hair and has a scar on the side of his forehead. He has yet to return home despite the ceasefire.
:'''Missing Person Poster:''' If any returning samurai or old friends and acquaintances know of his whereabouts, please inform me. You will be duly thanked for your help!

:'''Message:''' "Silence, you!"

===Ogura Textiles & Kimonos II===
:'''Message:''' "Thanks to your aid and support, [[Ogura Textiles & Kimonos]] has weathered the worst of this storm."
:'''Message:''' "Word is that the [[Kanjou Commission]] is currently negotiating with [[Liyue]]'s mercantile guilds and that the import of silks and ready-to-wear clothes will soon resume..."
:'''Message:''' "Once [[Ogura Yuu|my brother]] returns from his duties, we shall refurbish this store together."
:'''Message:''' "Once again, I, [[Ogura Mio]], would like to thank all our neighbors and friends for lending a helping hand. I will find a way to repay you all in turn."
:'''Reply:''' "No, no, it was what we should've done. You're too polite, Miss Ogura!"
:'''Reply:''' "Well, the war's over in any case, so don't mind if I engage your services again the next time I need a custom-made kimono!"

===Post-War Thoughts===
:'''Message:''' "We fought to the death against the folks from [[Sangonomiya Clan|Sangonomiya]], and now we need to rebuild an [[Yashiori Island|island]] together with them..."
:'''Message:''' "I mean, I know that it's an arrangement that comes down from the top and that everyone acknowledges that this is the right thing to do, but it just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, you know?"
:'''Reply:''' The time for peace has come, so don't think about it too much. Our cooperation now is also meant to build a better nation for future generations.

===Shikanoin Heizou===
:'''Message:''' "I am currently seeking my foolish younger brother, [[Shikanoin Heizou]]. He names himself a detective and behaves arrogantly and disrespectfully."

:'''Another Person's Message:''' "He's gone again, is he?"
:'''Message:''' "He's gone off to investigate again, yes... I can only hope that no one else gets hurt in the process."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "...Oh, so you were just worried about other people, huh..."

:'''Arataki "The Unbeaten Troublemaker" Itto:''' "Well alright then! Guess I'll just march right up to Tenshukaku's gates and challenge you to&mdash;"
:'''Scrawls:''' (The words here cannot be made out, almost as if the person who wrote them suddenly had a fall. Or perhaps...)

:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Due to his age and in consideration of his accomplishments, he has been confined to his quarters indefinitely, and will not be released on bail.
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' If he commits any treasonous acts during this time, his judgment will be executed with great prejudice and without mercy.
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' While the [[Tenryou Commission]] discusses matters of reformation, its duties shall be performed by a personal deputy of [[Raiden Shogun|Her Excellency]].

===Tenryou Notice: Tanuki===
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Citizens of [[Inazuma]], please stay alert while traveling at night. A monster in the form of a [[tanuki]] has been spotted around the city lately.
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' This monster appears to be infant-sized. It moves very quickly and is quite fierce!
:'''Tenryou Notice:''' Please report to a nearby Doushin or to the Tenryou Commission upon seeing it!
:'''Childishly Written Message:''' "I've told you, it's not a tanuki! Not a tanuki! Not. A. Tanuki. You hear!?"

:'''Message:''' "Ever since I read one of his books, I've always wondered what sort of person he might be."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Don't think about it too much. Maybe he's just like most authors from [[Inazuma]]. You know the type: some sickly, thin, glasses-wearing middle-aged man."
:'''Someone Else's Message:''' "He could also be some rotund scholar who speaks weirdly and stuff, you know..."
:'''A Third Person's Message:''' "You know what I think? I think he's got to be some mountain of martial muscle! A powerful body and a sharp mind, all rolled into one!"
:'''Yet Another Person's Message:''' "You're all wrong! I mean, just look at that lovely handwriting! It's gotta be a beautiful young woman, one who knows her way around books and scholarly tomes of all kinds!"
:'''Reply:''' Please control yourselves! This is a public notice board, not someplace to endlessly jabber about personal matters!

==Trivia==
* The "Mujina" in the Tanuki monster notice is likely referring to [[Sayu]], who is known as the Mujina Ninja.
* The "Outlanders in Ritou" message is hinted to be written by [[Heihachi]], an NPC the most opposed to outlander presence on Inazuma.
