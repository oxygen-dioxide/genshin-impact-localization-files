The '''Seven Archons''', typically shortened to '''The Seven''',<ref name="C0A2">{{Ref/Quest|Abyss Mage (Quest)}}</ref> are the seven [[gods]] who preside over the seven regions of [[Teyvat]], established after they or their predecessors emerged as the victors of the [[Archon War]] 2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an [[element]] and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment and determined their method of governance over their regions.

Each Archon possesses a magic focus called a [[Gnosis]], which allows them to resonate directly with [[Celestia]].<ref name="C0A3">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> By comparison, [[Vision]]s are "primitive" &mdash; though a Gnosis's capabilities and purpose, beyond acting as a symbol of an Archon's status, remain unknown. Each Archon is bound to a Divine Throne, which is composed of the Elemental Authority of one of the [[Seven Sovereigns]], and which grants them authority over the corresponding element.<ref name="TOONAB">{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}</ref>

As of [[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter IV]]: Act V - ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]'', only six Divine Thrones remain. The Hydro Archon's Divine Throne was destroyed, returning the Authority within to the [[Neuvillette|Hydro Dragon Sovereign]] and breaking the established order of the Seven.<ref name="TOONAB"/>

==History==
{{main|Archon War}}
The Archon War began an indeterminate time in the past, and ended around 2,000 years ago. During this period of time, many gods and archons roamed the land, locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy. It appears that the battles associated with the Archon War are a multitude of local struggles that were grouped together by human history. For example, Barbatos became the first Anemo Archon among The Seven after the death of [[Decarabian]] 2,600 years ago,<ref name="Venti V3"/> while Morax is implied to have already become Geo Archon by the time the last of the original Seven claimed their title and thus brought an end to the War.<ref name="ZL5">{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|5}}</ref>

The original Seven appeared to be relatively close, sharing a common duty of guiding humanity and often gathering in Liyue for drinks. However, over time, five of The Seven passed away, and some of the newer Archons no longer adhered to the duty of guiding humanity.<ref name="ZL5" />

===The Cataclysm===
500 years ago, the destruction of [[Khaenri'ah]] led to [[forbidden knowledge]] pollution and the rampage of [[Rhinedottir]]'s creations, which held the power of the [[Abyss]] and ravaged the world of Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest}}</ref> Among those who were perished in the ensuing conflicts were [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], [[Makoto|Raiden Makoto]], and [[Egeria]]. They were subsequently replaced by [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], [[Ei|Raiden Ei]], and [[Focalors]], respectively. The [[Tsaritsa]] was also greatly affected by the cataclysm, resulting in a drastic change in her personality.

The Seven were summoned to [[Tunigi Hollow]], where the worst outpouring of forbidden knowledge and monsters was occurring. During the battle, Egeria was killed and her body turned into the pool of water known as the Amrita.<ref name="Vibrant Pinion"/> To preserve the water's purity and tether the god to the mortal realm, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the [[Harvisptokhm]] &mdash; which serves as a seal over the dark hollow and prevents the corruption from spreading further &mdash; from the Amrita.<ref name="Splendorous">{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref> The [[Oceanid]]s, who served the former Hydro Archon but did not get along with Focalors,<ref name="Life Flows On II">{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (II)}}</ref> made their way to the Harvisptokhm in search of their master. Seeing that her current state was not what they had hoped for,<ref name="Pale Fire">{{Ref/Quest|Pale Fire (Quest)}}</ref> they spread all over the continent and world itself.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Rhodeia of Loch}}</ref>

During this time, the Traveler and [[Traveler's Sibling|their sibling]] descended on Teyvat and, seeing the chaos, attempted to leave this world, only to run afoul of the [[Unknown God]]. While the twins did not meet The Seven during this time, The Seven are aware of them and have been awaiting the Traveler's arrival.<ref>[[Map]], Interactable: [[Statue of The Seven#Description|Statue of The Seven]]</ref>

Around 400 years ago,<ref name="night-bird">{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref> Ei completed her research into creating a lifelike puppet, [[the Shogun]], to enforce her vision of Eternity over Inazuma while she retreated to the [[Plane of Euthymia]].<ref name="wanderer cs 2">{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|2}}</ref> Ever since then, the Shogun has been ruling Inazuma in her stead. Though Ei failed to make her puppets compatible with the Gnosis and thus gave it to [[Yae Miko]] instead, the Shogun is capable of tremendous feats even without it.

==Powers and Abilities==
An Archon's source of power has been attributed to three sources: the first is through presiding over their respective region,<ref name="C0A2" /> the second is from their people's faith in them and the third being one the Elemental Authorities stolen by the Heavenly Principles from the Seven Sovereigns.<ref name="BOAT"/> Barbatos, who refuses to govern Mondstadt directly and had left Mondstadt for extended periods of time in the past, claims to be the weakest of The Seven as a result; however, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was imprisoned in the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]] and shunned by the sages since she was born 500 years ago, explains that her fighting skills are inferior to the [[Traveler]]'s because she does not hold her people's faith.

The Seven appear to be privy to information that mortals are generally unaware of or deem to be merely fictional. Venti, Zhongli and Mavuika are aware of the existences of other worlds, as well as the fact that the Traveler had the power to travel between different worlds.

===Elemental Control===
Each Archon presides over their respective element and have used it to shape the landscape and climate of their respective territories. This ability seems to be held by any god and not only The Seven, but ever since the end of the Archon War, there have only been seven Archons at a time.

Unlike humans, who rely on resonance with a Vision to use the elements, the Archons seen so far were already affiliated with their elements before becoming Archons: [[Barbatos]] was originally a wind spirit who ascended to godhood, historical records regarding Morax address him as the "God of Geo" long before he became the Geo Archon, and Ei (and by proxy, Makoto) is an "incarnation of lightning."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|When Thunder Strikes}}</ref> Incarnations of Irminsul, i.e. Rukkhadevata and Nahida, are appointed guardians and maintainers of the tree of [[Irminsul]]. Nahida was created using a branch of Irminsul, confirming the connection between Irminsul and Dendro. [[Focalors]] (and by extension, [[Furina]]) was an [[Oceanid]] who was transformed into a human by [[Egeria]] using the power of the [[Primordial Sea]], though Furina has since been converted into a full human. An Oceanid legend says that Egeria herself was created by the [[Four Shades|Shade of Life]] to take the place of "the Primordial Sea's Heart" after the [[Hydro Dragon]] was "removed from that role." After the victory against [[Xiuhcoatl]], the {{Pyro}} [[Dragon Sovereign|Sovereign]], the first [[Pyro Archon]], [[Xbalanque]], bargained with the Ruler of Death, [[Ronova]], to borrow her power to establish the rules that would aid [[Natlan]]'s fight against the [[Abyss]] &mdash; the [[Ode of Resurrection]] and the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref> He also set up the systems and rules that would allow future mortals to ascend to Pyro Archonhood.<ref name="echoes"/>

While people on Teyvat commonly believe that the Archons grant Visions,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Research}}</ref> they actually have no control over the distribution of Visions and are largely unaware of circumstances surrounding Visions.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About the Vision}}</ref> However, within her Plane of Euthymia, Ei could enact the "Vision Hunt Decree" effect to seal all characters' Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts besides the [[Traveler]]'s.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Stormy Judgment}}</ref> Because the Plane of Euthymia is Ei's personal dimension, there is not enough information to determine how this effect works or whether Ei is capable of enacting this anywhere else.

==={{Not a Typo|Gnoses}}===
{{Main|Gnosis}}
While gnoses are described as being emblematic of an Archon's status and give them a direct connection to Celestia, their exact purpose and abilities remain a mystery. They evidently grant Archons a large power boost and the "divine ability" to defend their nations,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|Gnosis}}</ref> and Zhongli attributes the ability to mint [[Mora]] as something that "requires the use of the Geo Archon's power."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> The use of the gnoses' power is not exclusive to its respective Archon, as Nahida also utilized the power of the Electro Gnosis to aid in the healing of Irminsul. When [[Mavuika]] first ascended to Pyro Archon, it is implied that she threw away the vision she had as the [[Sacred Flame]] granted her significant knowledge and memory of Natlan.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Mavuika|Vision}}</ref>

===Divine Throne===
Each Divine Throne is composed of one of the Elemental Authorities stolen from the Seven Sovereigns by the Heavenly Principles, and it is the Throne that grants each Archon their authority over the corresponding element, though what exactly this entails remains yet unknown. A great amount of power is required to destroy the Throne, and its destruction, resulting in the death of the Archon bound to the Throne, appears to be the only way to return the Authority contained within to the Sovereign.<ref name="TOONAB"/>

===Vessel Creation===
On multiple occasions, Archons have fashioned humanoid vessels using their powers as an Archon, perhaps through the use of their Gnoses. Venti's vessel was his first use of his newfound divine power after ascending to godhood as the Anemo Archon.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|4}}</ref> [[Zhongli]]'s body was likely created through this method as well, as he states that his "structure is not the same as that of normal people."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|Feelings About Ascension: Building Up}}</ref> After becoming the first Electro Archon, Makoto "reforged" Ei's body after Ei gave up her bodily form so Makoto could ascend to the "heavenly citadel."<ref>{{Ref/Book|Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi|1}}</ref>

Although gods are immortal, their physical vessels &mdash; including those made with the power of an Archon &mdash; have finite lifespans and can be "killed," while their consciousness can fade away.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|1}}</ref> By the time of the main story, five of the original Seven have died and been replaced. While pondering how she would overcome her physical lifespan, Ei stumbled on a method of creating synthetic puppets indistinguishable from true life, which she used to create [[Scaramouche]] and [[the Shogun]]. After giving her Gnosis to [[Yae Miko]] for safekeeping, Ei discarded her physical form, the Shogun warning her that there was no return from giving up her body.<ref name="Raiden 2">{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|2}}</ref> Due to no longer having a physical body, Ei is only able to manifest herself outside of her Plane of Euthymia by using the body of the puppet as her own.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell to the Past}}</ref>

Vessels created through an Archon's power have another major weakness: they are incapable of being healed through ordinary means, including a Vision-bearer's healing abilities.<ref name="C0A3"/> Venti harnesses the power of the [[Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero]] twice to heal himself; first was to expunge the [[abyss]]al magic that poisoned him via [[Dvalin]] when the Traveler unintentionally interrupted them,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Let the Wind Lead (Quest)}}</ref> and the second was to recover after having his Gnosis taken by Signora.<ref name="C0A3" /> The exact properties this tree holds is unclear, but it may have a connection to Celestia: according to legend, it grew from the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia.

In case of [[Pyro Archon]], a mortal can ascend to godhood after winning the position through the [[Pilgrimage]]. As Pyro Archons are still mortals who age and die like regular humans, Natlan has had many Pyro Archons in the past. When a new Pyro Archon ascends to the Divine Throne, their "inner flame" will awaken, and the [[Sacred Flame]] grants them significant knowledge and memory of this land.<ref name="echoes">{{Ref/Quest|Echoes of Life}}</ref>

It's important to note that vessels can be the Archons themselves and not different entities. This page specifically refers to a human body created by Archons to live among the people of Teyvat as vessel creation is not exclusive to the Archons, in fact most gods are capable of this feat.

{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}

==Trivia== 
* When casting Elemental Skills and Bursts, the ends of an Archon's hair glow brightly with their element's color.
* Though the only two remaining Archons of the original Seven are Barbatos and Morax, Beelzebul &mdash; the current Electro Archon &mdash; was also a veteran of the Archon War, with her sister Baal taking the original Electro seat. It is not yet known if any of the other current Archons were active during the Archon War.
** During the {{Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is erased from Irminsul, becoming forgotten by all of Teyvat except for the Traveler. In the new history that results from this action, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's existence is replaced by that of Lesser Lord Kusanali; it is now believed that she has been the Dendro Archon since the end of the Archon War &mdash; therefore being one of the original Seven &mdash; and became imprisoned by the sages of Sumeru after losing her memories during the cataclysm.
* Currently, there is a running gag<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Traverse the Mortal Plane|quote='''Paimon:''' Wait a second. Ei... are you saying you don't have any Mora either?<br>[...]<br>'''Ei:''' ...Wait, what do you mean, "either"?}}</ref> in which the Archons encountered have no Mora:
** Barbatos, as Venti, has those listening to him buy him drinks instead of giving him Mora.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|2}}</ref> He also pilfers from the [[Dawn Winery]] to eat<ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|Good Afternoon}}</ref> and as soon as he has something that is spendable, he thinks of spending it on drinks.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|Opening Treasure Chest}}</ref> His occupation as a bard is also not lucrative in the first place.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|About Mona}}</ref>
** Morax did not pay attention to price tags prior to beginning life as Zhongli, because he could make Mora as needed with his Gnosis.<ref name="the fond farewell">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> As a result, Zhongli easily spends (or agrees to spend) large amounts of Mora, generally having others pay for his expenses. He also did not think of setting aside some Mora for personal use before relinquishing his Gnosis.<ref name="the fond farewell" />
** Beelzebul has no need for Mora, as she simply asks the [[Tri-Commission]] to bring the items to her.
** Buer has not mentioned any struggles with Mora in her dialogue, but she struggles to place a hypothetical price tag on the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]] despite ruminating over it for a long time,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Nahida|About Dori}}</ref> implying that she struggles to comprehend values that would equate to large amounts of Mora. This is likely due to her 500-year imprisonment in the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]], where she received information and items for free via the Akasha and sages, respectively.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Nahida|Nahida's "Toy Box"}}</ref>
** Although Furina is not an Archon, she partially continues the running gag, as she is considered unemployed following the {{Quest|Masquerade of the Guilty}}.
*** While [[Neuvillette]] has made arrangements to ensure Furina will not have material issues,<ref name="Finale">{{Ref/Quest|Finale}}</ref> she decides to live alone in a small apartment, where she struggles with cooking and ends up only eating macaroni with different sauces.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Yesterday}}</ref>
*** Furina herself does have a substantial amount of Mora, as she saved the Mora she earned over the last few centuries in a "private reserve." She now uses this Mora as an ordinary Fontainian, though she tends to overspend.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Furina}}</ref> This may be a direct callback to Zhongli's failure to set aside some "private funds" for himself and how particularly disastrous it can be when he habitually agrees to transactions involving large amounts of Mora.
** [[Mavuika]], the current Haborym, is the first Archon to break this trend of having a poor sense on money, having a frugal mindset based on the scarce resources of her nation due to the war against the [[Abyss]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Sun Rises and Sets|quote='''Mavuika:''' Besides, with so much of our nation in ruins, resources are still scarce. Extra spending for my sake is the last thing we need.}}</ref> and tactfully handling with said resources.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Sun Rises and Sets|quote='''Mavuika:''' In addition, all leftover supplies will be purchased by the Speaker's Chamber, sorted, and donated to the appropriate areas.}}</ref>

===Etymology=== 
* The term "{{wt|archon}}" is a Greek word that refers to "A person who claims the right to rule, or to exercise power or sovereign authority over other human beings." ''Genshin Impact'' uses its {{w|Gnosticism|Gnostic}} usage,<ref name="PASH">Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv10739818 Chinese translation of the PASH May 2021 article] (original Japanese text included)</ref> in which the {{w|Archon (Gnosticism)|archons}} are seven supernatural beings who each rule over one of the {{w|Classical planet|seven planets}}. They are subservient to the {{w|demiurge}}, the creator of the material universe who is beneath the {{w|Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad}}, the true God. By reaching ''{{w|gnosis}}'', an understanding of divine knowledge, one can transcend the confines of the material world and escape the dominion of the archons.
** A miHoYo developer interview on the May 2021 edition of the Japanese entertainment magazine PASH states that Gnosticism was selected as the primary mythological basis for ''Genshin Impact'', particularly in regards to how Gnosticism deals with the relationship between man and world, and how the archons influence the world.<ref name="PASH" />
* Several Archons have their Goetic names directly derived from one of the 72 demons found in the ''Ars Goetia'', one of the books in ''{{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon}}''. Gods who predate The Seven have varying levels of similarity to a demon name in the ''Ars Goetia'' (see {{S|Gods#Etymology}}).
** {{w|Barbatos}} is one of the Dukes of Hell.
** {{w|Morax (demon)|Morax}} is a Great Earl and a President of Hell.
** {{w|Bael (demon)|Baal}} is the first king of Hell.
*** Although {{w|Beelzebub|Beelzebul}}, Ei's alternate name, is not used in the ''Ars Goetia'', it is associated with Baal. Ei herself has continued to rule under the name "Baal."
** {{w|Buer (demon)|Buer}} is a Great President of Hell.
** {{w|Haborym}} is another name for Aym, a Great Duke of Hell.
** Unlike the other named Archons, Focalors is not a direct lift; instead, it is a derivation of {{w|Focalor}}, a Great Duke of Hell.
