The '''Seven Archons''', typically shortened to '''The Seven''',<ref name="C0A2">{{Ref/Quest|Abyss Mage (Quest)}}</ref> are the seven [[gods]] who preside over the seven regions of [[Teyvat]]. Each Archon is associated with an element and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment and determined their method of governance over their regions.

The original Seven were the victors of the [[Archon War]] two thousand years before the main story. By the start of the game, only two of them remain: [[Barbatos]] and [[Morax]]. Of the current Seven, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali|Buer]] is the youngest, at 500 years old.

Each Archon has an internal magic focus called a [[Gnosis]], which allows them to resonate directly with [[Celestia]].<ref name="C0A3">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> By comparison, [[Vision]]s are "primitive" &mdash; though what exactly a Gnosis is capable of, as well as its purpose beyond a symbol of an Archon's godhood, is unknown.

==History==
The Archon War began an indeterminate time in the past, and ended around 2,000 years ago. During this period of time, many gods and archons roamed the land, locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy. It appears that the battles associated with the Archon War are a multitude of local struggles that were grouped together by human history. For example, Barbatos became the first Anemo Archon among The Seven after the death of [[Decarabian]] 2,600 years ago, while Morax is implied to have already become Geo Archon by the time the last of the original Seven claimed their title and thus brought an end to the War.<ref name="ZL5">{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|5}}</ref>

The original Seven appeared to be relatively close, sharing a common duty of guiding humanity and often gathering in Liyue for drinks. However, over time, five of The Seven passed away, and some of the newer archons no longer adhered to the duty of guiding humanity.<ref name="ZL5" />

[[Murata]], the suspected current Pyro Archon, came into power some time before Barbatos went into slumber for the first time. When he woke up 1,000 years ago in response to the aristocracy's oppression of Mondstadt, he tells [[Vennessa]] about Murata and speaks about her with familiarity.

At some point in time, the previous Hydro Archon died and was replaced by the [[Focalors]], the current Hydro Archon. The [[Oceanid]]s who served her did not get along with the new archon and went on self-exile from Fontaine,<ref name="Life Flows On II">{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (II)}}</ref> spreading all over the continent and world itself.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Rhodeia of Loch}}</ref>

500 years ago, the alchemist [[Rhinedottir]], also known as "Gold," caused the destruction of [[Khaenri'ah]] and created multitudes of monsters which ravaged the world of Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest}}</ref> Among those who were perished in the ensuing conflicts were [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] and [[Makoto|Raiden Makoto]], who were subsequently replaced by [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] and [[Ei|Raiden Ei]] respectively. The [[Tsaritsa]] was also greatly affected by the cataclysm, resulting in a drastic change in her personality.

During this time, the Traveler and [[Traveler's Sibling|their sibling]] descended on Teyvat and, seeing the chaos, attempted to leave this world, only to run afoul of the [[Unknown God]]. While the twins did not meet The Seven during this time, The Seven are aware of them and have been awaiting the Traveler's arrival.<ref>[[Map]], Interactable: [[Statue of The Seven#Description|Statue of The Seven]]</ref>

==Powers and Abilities==
An Archon's strength derives from the level of control they exert over their respective region. Barbatos, who refuses to govern Mondstadt directly due to following his ideal of Freedom, is the weakest of The Seven despite being the second-oldest member.<ref name="C0A2" />

The Seven appear to be privy to information that mortals are generally unaware of or deem to be merely fictional. Both Venti and Zhongli are aware of the existences of other worlds, as well as the fact that the Traveler had the power to travel between different worlds.

===Elemental Control===
Each Archon presides over their respective element and have used it to shape the landscape and climate of their respective territories. This ability seems to be held by any god and not only The Seven, but ever since the end of the Archon War, there have only been seven Archons at a time.

Unlike humans, who rely on resonance with a Vision to use the elements, the Archons seen so far were already affiliated with their elements before becoming Archons: [[Barbatos]] was originally a wind spirit who ascended to godhood, historical records regarding Morax address him as the "God of Geo" long before he became the Geo Archon, and Ei (and by proxy, Makoto) is an "incarnation of lightning."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|When Thunder Strikes}}</ref> Incarnations of Buer, i.e. Rukkhadevata and Nahida, are appointed guardians and maintainers of the tree of [[Irminsul]]. Nahida was created using a branch of Irminsul, confirming the connection between Irminsul and Dendro.

While people on Teyvat commonly believe that the Archons grant Visions,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Research}}</ref> they actually have no control over the distribution of Visions and are largely unaware of circumstances surrounding Visions.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About the Vision}}</ref> However, within her [[Plane of Euthymia]], Ei could enact the "Vision Hunt Decree" effect to seal all characters' Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts besides the [[Traveler]]'s.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Stormy Judgment}}</ref> Because the Plane of Euthymia is Ei's personal dimension, there is not enough information to determine how this effect works or whether Ei is capable of enacting this anywhere else.

==={{Not a typo|Gnoses}}===
{{main|Gnosis}}
While gnoses are described as being emblematic of an Archon's status and give them a direct connection to Celestia, their exact purpose and abilities remain a mystery. They evidently grant Archons a large power boost and the "divine ability" to defend their nations,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|Gnosis}}</ref> and Zhongli attributes the ability to mint [[Mora]] as something that "requires the use of the Geo Archon's power."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> The use of the gnoses' power is not exclusive to its respective Archon, as Nahida also utilized the power of the Electro Gnosis to aid in the healing of Irminsul.

===Vessel Creation===
On multiple occasions, Archons have fashioned humanoid vessels using their powers as an Archon, perhaps through the use of their Gnoses. Venti's vessel was his first use of his newfound divine power after ascending to godhood as the Anemo Archon.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|4}}</ref> [[Zhongli]]'s body was likely created through this method as well, as he states that his "structure is not the same as that of normal people."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|Feelings About Ascension: Building Up}}</ref> After becoming the first Electro Archon, Makoto "reforged" Ei's body after Ei gave up her bodily form so Makoto could ascend to the "heavenly citadel".<ref>{{Ref/Book|Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi|1}}</ref>

Although gods are immortal, their physical vessels &mdash; including those made with the power of an Archon &mdash; have finite lifespans and can be "killed," while their consciousness can fade away.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|1}}</ref> By the time of the main story, five of the original Seven have died and been replaced. While pondering how she would overcome her physical lifespan, Ei stumbled on a method of creating synthetic puppets indistinguishable from true life, which she used to create [[Scaramouche]] and [[the Shogun]]. After giving her Gnosis to [[Yae Miko]] for safekeeping, Ei discarded her physical form, the Shogun warning her that there was no return from giving up her body.<ref name="Raiden 2">{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|2}}</ref> Due to no longer having a physical body, Ei is only able to manifest herself outside of her Plane of Euthymia by using the body of the puppet as her own.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell to the Past}}</ref>

Vessels created through an Archon's power have another major weakness: they are incapable of being healed through ordinary means, including a Vision-bearer's healing abilities.<ref name="C0A3" /> Venti harnesses the power of the [[Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero]] twice to heal himself; first was to expunge the [[abyss]]al magic that poisoned him via [[Dvalin]] when the Traveler unintentionally interrupted them,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Let the Wind Lead (Quest)}}</ref> and the second was to recover after having his Gnosis taken by Signora.<ref name="C0A3" /> The exact properties this tree holds is unclear, but it may have a connection to Celestia: according to legend, it grew from the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia.

;Notes
{{Reflist|group=upper-alpha}}

==Trivia== 
* When casting Elemental Skills and Bursts, the ends of an Archon's hair glow brightly with their element's color.
* Though the only two remaining Archons of the original Seven are Barbatos and Morax, Beelzebul &mdash; the current Electro Archon &mdash; was also a veteran of the Archon War, with her sister Baal taking the original Electro seat. It is not yet known if any of the other current Archons were active during the Archon War.
* After the {{Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is fully erased from Irminsul, becoming forgotten by all of Teyvat except for the Traveler. In the new history that results from this action, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's existence is replaced by that of Lesser Lord Kusanali; it is now believed that Lesser Lord Kusanali has always been the Dendro Archon since the end of the Archon War &mdash; and therefore is one of the original Seven &mdash; and became imprisoned by the sages of Sumeru after losing her memories during the Cataclysm.
* All currently released archons (and the [[Unknown God]]), with the possible exception of Morax, seem to be visually inspired by characters in ''{{W|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'':
** Barbatos as [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Wendy|Wendy]].
** Morax's inspiration is unclear and debated among fans. One possible inspiration is [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Welt Yang|Welt Yang]].
** Raiden Ei as [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Raiden_Mei|Raiden Mei]].
** Kusanali as [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Theresa Apocalypse|Theresa Apocalypse]].
** The Unknown God as [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Herrscher of the Void|Kiana Kaslana]] in Herrscher of the Void form.
** Murata may be named after [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Murata Himeko|Murata Himeko]] as well.
* Currently, there is a running gag in which the Archons encountered have no Mora:
** Barbatos, as Venti, has those listening to him buy him drinks instead of Mora. His voice-overs also mention him pilfering from the [[Dawn Winery]] to eat and trading whatever he comes across for Mora to immediately spend on drinks.
** Morax did not pay attention to price tags prior to beginning life as Zhongli, because he could make Mora as needed with his Gnosis. As a result, Zhongli easily spends (or agrees to spend) large amounts of Mora, generally having others pay for his expenses.
** Ei has no need for Mora as she simply asks the [[Tri-Commission]] to bring the items to her.
** Kusanali has not mentioned any struggles with Mora in her dialogue, but she is implied to not to have any need for Mora due to being initially imprisoned in the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]] and simply getting the information she needs from Irminsul.
* All of the playable members of the Seven have a [[Weekly Boss]] tied to them in some way.
** Of these, Kusanali is currently the only one that does not have a "companion" of sorts that serves as a Weekly Boss.

===Etymology=== 
* The term "{{wt|archon}}" is a Greek word that refers to "A person who claims the right to rule, or to exercise power or sovereign authority over other human beings." ''Genshin Impact'' uses its {{w|Gnosticism|Gnostic}} usage,<ref name="PASH">Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv10739818 Chinese translation of the PASH May 2021 article], with the original Japanese text included</ref> in which the {{w|Archon (Gnosticism)|archons}} are seven supernatural beings who each rule over one of the {{w|Classical planet|seven planets}}. They are subservient to the {{w|demiurge}}, the creator of the material universe who is beneath the {{w|Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad}}, the true God. By reaching ''{{w|gnosis}}'', an understanding of divine knowledge, one can transcend the confines of the material world and escape the dominion of the archons.
** A miHoYo developer interview on the May 2021 edition of the Japanese entertainment magazine PASH states that Gnosticism was selected as the primary mythological basis for ''Genshin Impact'', particularly in regards to how Gnosticism deals with the relationship between man and world, and how the archons influence the world.<ref name="PASH" />
* So far, every named Archon has a name directly derived from one of the 72 demons found in the ''Ars Goetia'', one of the books in ''{{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon}}''. Gods who predate The Seven have varying levels of similarity to a demon name in the ''Ars Goetia'' (see [[Gods#Etymology|Gods § Etymology]]).
** {{w|Barbatos}} is one of the dukes of Hell.
** {{w|Morax (demon)|Morax}} is a president of Hell.
** {{w|Bael (demon)|Baal}} is the first king of Hell. Although {{w|Beelzebub|Beelzebul}}, Ei's alternate name, is not used in the ''Ars Goetia'', Beelzebul is associated with Baal and Ei herself goes by the name "Baal" amongst the other Archons due to her former status as Makoto's ''kagemusha''.
** {{w|Buer (demon)|Buer}} is a Great President of Hell.
