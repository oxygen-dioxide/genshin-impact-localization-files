|desc_suspicious = The Mint and Jueyun Chili have neither been matched nor incorporated well, which makes for a dish so spicy that any who eat it will be at a loss for words for a time.
|desc_basic      = Finely chopped Jueyun Chilis blended with a sauce and mixed with Mint leaves. It looks like nothing special, but it has surprisingly potent powers of refreshment and reinvigoration. It is also the perfect palate-cleanser after a greasy, indulgent meal.
|desc_delicious  = The slightly bitter minty-fresh flavors do not cover the blazing mouthfeel of the Jueyun Chili but instead cause the spiciness to reach new heights. The two whirl and pirouette on your tongue like a pair of contending dancers to the hearty and vigorous applause of all.
