==Steps==
Start the quest by interacting with the stone tablet in the middle of Cuijue Slope.
#Collect all [[Stone of Remembrance]] (obtained by making offerings to [[Statues of The Seven]] in [[Liyue]])
#Climb each of the pillars and insert the stone
#*Collect the exquisite chest that spawns after inlaying each [[Stone of Remembrance]].
#*Some pillars are guarded by enemies.
#Enter the ruins
#Search the ruins
#*The fight does not start until you approach the inactive Ruin Guard in the center of the ruins. You can kill the spiders at the edges of the room before activating the Ruin Guard for an easier time.
#*Pyro [[Infusion Stone]]s will spawn periodically during the fight. They will buff the enemies considerably but they can be destroyed to remove the buff (although sometimes it may be bugged where they cannot be destroyed; logging out and into the game resolves the bug).
#*There will be 3 waves of enemies:{{Enemy List|Ruin Guard;Geovishap Hatchling*2;Ruin Hunter}}
#**A {{Enemy|Geovishap Hatchling}} and a trap will spawn alongside the Infusion Stone when facing the Ruin Hunter. The Geovishap Hatchling and the trap will despawn once the infusion stone is destroyed.
#Search the ruins
#*The room in the back will have 1 Luxurious [[Chest]], 1 Precious Chest, and 1 [[Noblesse Oblige|Royal Flora]] (5 Star)
#Fetch a good price for the [[Dull Ring]]
#*Choose one option:
##Talk to [[Bolai]] at Liyue Harbor
##*You can choose to sell the ring for 180,000 Mora + 5 [[Adeptus' Temptation]].
##Talk to [[Linlang]]
##*You can choose to sell the ring for 200,000 Mora.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing the quest requires selling the ring to either Bolai or Linlang. From a long-term perspective, the difference in rewards is largely negligible. However, for a practical comparison between their rewards:
** While Linlang offers 20,000 more Mora upfront than Bolai does, Bolai also gives 5 regular-quality Adeptus' Temptation.
** The required Mora for purchasing all the ingredients needed to make 5 Adeptus' Temptation, instead of collecting them from the world, ranges between 19,450 - 22,950 Mora (depending on the player's active discounts and ingredient processing choices).
** Cooking Adeptus' Temptation requires [[Salt]] (for [[Ham]] processing) and [[Shrimp Meat]], ingredients currently only obtained through shops. Purchasing 20 Salt and 15 Shrimp, the amount needed to cook 5 Adeptus' Temptation, costs 1200 Mora for the Salt and 1800 Mora for the Shrimp (1000 Mora (Salt) and 1575 Mora (Shrimp) respectively, if purchasing from [[Second Life]] with Liyue [[Reputation]] Rank 4), lowering the practical difference between Bolai and Linlang's offers to 17,000 (17,425) Mora. In exchange, players who can cook Delicious Adeptus' Temptation get 56 more ATK and 2% more CRIT Rate out of each dish compared to its regular quality.
* Completing this quest grants the {{Achievement|Scourge of the Battlefield}}.
* This battle '''can''' be played in [[Co-Op Mode]] by starting the quest in solo mode and then inviting friends. Only the host can interact with the pillars and claim the rewards, but other players can help with the fight.
* It is possible to leave the area in between waves and battle progress will be saved. (For example, if you teleport away after defeating the Ruin Hunter, returning to the area will continue the fight with the Geovishap Hatchlings.)

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Read the inscription, for the tablets both outside and inside the temple)
:'''Inscription:''' "Greed, nostalgia, vision, jealousy, anger, lust, self-aggrandizement, competition, turmoil..."
:'''Inscription:''' "These nine mortal desires may heal the world, or do it great hurt. Their fire will never diminish, and it will never fade... Thus, we lay down nine pillars to bring peace, to end here the conflicts that plague this world."
:'''Inscription:''' "If one who comes after will break those pillars and enter, war shall once again consume the world."
:'''Inscription:''' "O you who read this tablet, claim the treasure that lies within, and bring peace to Liyue."

;(Read the inscription again, outside tablet only)
:'''Inscription:''' "All the turmoils in the world have their root in human vice..."
:'''Inscription:''' "Nine pillars we raise here to suppress conflict, that we may never again raise armies against each other..."
----
;(Upon opening the chest with the Dull Ring)
:'''Paimon:''' This ruin gives Paimon the creeps. But this should be the end of it...
:'''Paimon:''' And we got some treasure for our efforts, too &mdash; we even got ourselves that ring!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go find someone who has an {{Color|buzzword|eye for antiques}} and see how much it'll sell for.

===Selling the ring to Linlang===
;(Talk to Linlang)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Could you help us look at this antique?
:'''Linlang:''' An antique? Well, you've come to the right person. I'd say that I'm the fairest at valuating such things in all of Liyue. Let's see it.
:'''Linlang:''' Hmm, both the gemstone and the band are of fine quality, and it is very ancient... Yet it is very well-preserved &mdash; highly unusual.
:'''Linlang:''' Still, I can't say I've ever heard the phrase "Disaster runs rampant throughout the world <!--extra space in dialogue-->, and all who live do so in agony."
:'''Linlang:''' Never mind that. Where did you find this ring?
:{{DIcon}} In a ruin near Cuijue Slope.
:'''Linlang:''' You... You're fair hand at this, aren't you? Not many dare to go there to hunt for treasure.
:'''Linlang:''' Were those ruins surrounded by nine pillars, with a stone tablet in the center, by any chance?
:'''Linlang:''' Don't look so surprised. I've heard many people who come to do business with me mention that place. They always say that such a large formation must have some sort of treasure within.
:'''Linlang:''' They even say that those pillars and that ruin were built by Liyue's forebears in order to quell conflict...
:'''Linlang:''' But I suppose that's just a legend. After all, if nine stone pillars could quell strife, this world would have been at peace long ago.
:'''Linlang:''' But regardless of whether this legend is true or not, this ring was found in that ruin, and has to be related to that legend.
:'''Linlang:''' It's got a name, a history to go with it, and it's of good quality, too. It'll fetch a fine price.
:'''Linlang:''' ...Relax, I'm not going to ask how you got in there. I just do business. Other matters are none of my concern.
:'''Linlang:''' All in all, I'd say this ring's worth {{Color|buzzword|200,000 Mora}}. What do you say?
:{{DIcon}} We have a deal.
::'''Linlang:''' Well, here's the money, then. I'll take the ring in exchange.
::'''Linlang:''' If you ever pick up any other antiques that you'd like to sell, feel free to come to me.
:{{DIcon}} Let me give it some thought.
::'''Linlang:''' My prices are likely to be the fairest. If you have any problem with it, you can go and check with other people.

;(Talk to Linlang again)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Regarding that ring...
:'''Linlang:''' Oh, you've considered the matter? Will you sell or not, then?
:{{DIcon}} Sold.
:;(Same as dialogue for "We have a deal," above)
:{{DIcon}} I need to give it some more thought.
::'''Linlang:''' How conscientious of you. Well, go ahead then. Compare the prices as much as you wish.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Selling the ring to Bolai===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Bolai)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Could you help us look at this antique?
:'''Bolai:''' Antiques and curios? I'm not too familiar with them, but I'll have a look.
:'''Bolai:''' This ring... Huh, it's set with a jade gem, and one of good quality, too. Just the gem alone would be worth a sum.
:'''Bolai:''' There's an inscription on it, too... "Disaster runs rampant throughout the world, and all who live do so in agony..." Where did you find this ring?
:{{DIcon}} In a ruin near [[Cuijue Slope]].
:'''Bolai:''' Cuijue Slope, huh... Tsk, tsk, what a shame. [[Jueyun Karst]] is so nearby, too...
:'''Bolai:''' If this ring came from a ruin in Jueyun Karst, it would surely fetch a great price.
:'''Bolai:''' Unfortunately, without any storied origin, this one's price falls a great deal. But it's of good quality. I'm sure someone would want it nonetheless.
:'''Bolai:''' How about this? I'll offer you {{Color|buzzword|180,000 Mora}} for this ring, with a few add-ons to boot. Would you sell it to me?
:{{DIcon}} Sold.
::'''Bolai:''' Wonderful! Very decisive. Here's the money. It's yours.
::'''Bolai:''' Ah, this ring is a true treasure...
::'''Bolai:''' There must be other such gems within those ruins...
:{{DIcon}} What add-ons?
::'''Bolai:''' What, you ask... Well, it'll be good, that's for sure. I won't do wrong by you.
::{{DIcon}} Sold.
::;(Same as above)
::{{DIcon}}  Let me give it a little thought...
:::'''Bolai:''' You... Well, alright. Give it some thought. Perhaps my offer isn't the best you've heard.
:::'''Bolai:''' But when it comes to business, I'll do right by you should sell it to me.
:::'''Bolai:''' Think about it. This ring won't stop changing hands with me. If you sell it to me now, don't you think I'll let you in on any further transactions that take place down the line?
:::'''Bolai:''' Moreover, I'm willing to add some things on, to boot...
:::'''Bolai:''' Think on it carefully, and come back to me anytime should you decide to sell!
:{{DIcon}} Let me give it a little thought...
:;(Same as above)

;(Talk to Bolai again)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Regarding that ring...
:'''Bolai:''' Have you considered it? Well then, are you willing to sell it to me?
:{{DIcon}} Sold.
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} What add-ons?
::'''Bolai:''' What, you ask... Well, it'll be good, that's for sure. I won't do wrong by you.
::{{DIcon}} Sold.
::;(Same as above)
::{{DIcon}} Let me think again...
:::'''Bolai:''' Are you comparing prices, or what...
:::'''Bolai:''' Fine. Consider the matter carefully. I'll be here to seal the deal if you're willing to sell.
:{{DIcon}} Let me think again...
:;(Same as above)
