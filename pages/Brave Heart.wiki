==Trivia==
* This artifact set is based around [[Arundolyn]] and his childhood friend [[Rostam]].
* In the description for Crown of the Brave, "she" is [[Vennessa]]. However, the cataclysm takes place 500 years before the main story, making it 500 years after Vennessa's rebellion and not 1000. This error is also present in the original Chinese text.
