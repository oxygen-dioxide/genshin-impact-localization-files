* During this attack, the Consecrated Flying Serpent will temporarily exit '''Phagocytic Form''' and spawn a Phagocytic Energy Block that lasts for '''6''' seconds.
** The Phagocytic Energy Block can be destroyed using a single {{Anemo}} attack or 6 non-Anemo elemental attacks.
** If destroyed, the active character will obtain a status that lasts for 10 seconds:
*** While the status is active, all party members will lose '''2%''' of their Max [[HP]] every second.
*** The next time a [[Normal Attack|Normal]]/[[Charged Attack|Charged]]/[[Plunging Attack|Plunging]] Attack, [[Elemental Skill]] or [[Elemental Burst]] hits the Consecrated Flying Serpent, the status is consumed and it will lose '''15%''' of its Max HP and become paralyzed.
*** If the status expires after 10 seconds, the Consecrated Flying Serpent will re-enter '''Phagocytic Form'''.
** If not destroyed in time, the Consecrated Flying Serpent will reabsorb the Phagocytic Energy Block and re-enter '''Phagocytic Form'''.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A reptile that has mutated after feeding from greater lifeforms.<br />Though now imbued with the power of elemental manipulation, the Consecrated Beasts themselves still cannot fully digest the pieces of flesh they devoured from the immortal carcasses that they ate. Instead, the pieces slowly fused with the beasts themselves, weaving a bony shell over their body, one that shares a similar composition to a [[Crystal Marrow|certain type of smelting material from Inazuma]].|[[Archive]]}}
