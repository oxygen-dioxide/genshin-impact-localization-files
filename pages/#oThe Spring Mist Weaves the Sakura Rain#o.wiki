|description    = A lovely and lush Sakura Tree that has the purest "cherry color."<br />In daylight, the radiant crowns of these trees catch the sunlight. When the gentle wind blows through, its leaves fall like rain, scattering their light yet rich fragrance around. Four parts elegance, three parts sweetness, two parts warmth, and one part tranquility, its aroma blend guides people into sweet sleep like pillows of [[Yumemiru Wood]], allowing them to have sweet dreams for so long as they rest under the tree's shade.

A blueprint for "The Spring Mist Weaves the Sakura Rain" cannot be obtained, but the furnishing itself can be obtained as a reward upon raising the [[Sacred Sakura's Favor]] level to 50.

Interacting with the cat statue in front of the tree makes it meow, while rays of light appear (daytime only) and sakura petals start to fall around player. One of the petals appears on the statue's nose and, unlike others, doesn't start to fall immediately.
