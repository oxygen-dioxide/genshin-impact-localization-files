==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Gontharet:''' *sigh* What are we going to do about this?
:{{DIcon}} What's the matter?
::'''Gontharet:''' There's something terribly wrong in Fontaine, that's what! Something's got to change, and we're all responsible for making that happen! We have to band together and fight for our rights!
::{{DIcon}} What are you talking about, anyway?
::'''Gontharet:''' Fontaine, of course, Fontaine! The Palais Mermonia, our energy situation, our top-down system... We have so many problems here. Can't you see?
::'''Gontharet:''' I've spoken to Arouet about them many times, and he agrees with my points &mdash; why, he's even treated me to coffee several times!
::'''Gontharet:''' It's just that... Well, that hasn't worked as well recently. He says that my opinions don't attract him the way they used to.
::{{DIcon}} Not working?
::'''Gontharet:''' Work? Why, I'm doing something far more important than work!
::'''Gontharet:''' Those who always work and work will find themselves little different from clockwork machines. It is only through constant questioning and asking that we can forge a new path!
::'''Gontharet:''' Our history and present are all proof of this.
::'''Gontharet:''' If you do not mind treating me to a cup of coffee, we can continue this line of conversation.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Gontharet:''' ...Wait, you're leaving already?
