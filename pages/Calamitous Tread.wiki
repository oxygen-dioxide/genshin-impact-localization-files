{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter the infirmary)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're back!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Welcome back. Do you want a cup of tea?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How can you be so much like Wriothesley, always drinking tea...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Huh, actually, now that you mention it, I just remembered something now.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' While I was sedated, I could still barely hear two people talking next to me. They were discussing everything from the leaves to the water and even the teacups themselves...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Must have been Wriothesley and Sigewinne.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Yeah, I heard one male voice and one female, so it should have been the two of them. They... really were just talking about brewing tea.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I really can't make sense of this place...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So, {{Traveler}}, Paimon... Were you able to learn anything from Wriothesley?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, he explained everything.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Very well... then would you mind checking your answers against my speculations?
:{{DIcon}} Lyney sounds a lot more like his old self.
:{{DIcon}} Feeling better now, Lyney?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yeah, I took the time to rest, so I'm feeling a lot more relaxed now.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Nobody else is around, and Miss Sigewinne is also busy with something or other, so let's just talk here.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Alright. Then, I'll posit my theories. I asked myself three questions.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Firstly, why was Freminet affected by the Primordial Seawater? It was because he dove into the sea. My theory is... the long lost Primordial Sea is probably very close to the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, he's good! He got that right on the first try!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' That's our Lyney.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Secondly, Wriothesley's attitude changed dramatically during the course of our stay here. He ignored us completely at first, then suddenly roadblocked us. Why?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I spent quite a long time thinking about this. If he has been monitoring the Fatui since the very beginning, he probably ignored us at first because he was hoping we could find Master Childe for him.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' What's more, the Fortress of Meropide is not a part of Fontaine's court system, nor does it report to Iudex Neuvillette. Wriothesley is basically the king of a no man's land.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' As long as the Fortress doesn't do anything about Master Childe's disappearance, "Father" can use it to pressure the Fontaine authorities. And while the two factions are pitted against each other, Wriothesley will be free to move between the parties of interest.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If I had to guess, he probably has something that he's working on himself. It's likely related to the secret of the infirmary, but I just can't think of what it could be...
:{{DIcon}} Lyney's grasp of the big picture is amazing.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're super smart!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, thanks so much. Then finally, there's the last question.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If Wriothesley does have a plan, what could it be? All I know for now is that his plan probably has something to do with the changing nature of the seawater. He's even gotten Clorinde to help him out...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...That can't be the full extent of what he's doing. There's probably a secret passageway behind the block in the infirmary, and there's something big in the Fortress that most people here never get to see. He has a bargaining chip, and it could be important enough for Father to deal with him directly.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I don't have enough information, so I have no idea what his chip might be. But let me guess... you have the last piece of the puzzle.
:{{Black Screen|After some deliberation, you share the information you just learned with Lyney and company.}}
:{{Black Screen|While sharing what you saw, you emphasize that now is not the time for disputes, and it's very important that they take the matter seriously and considerately.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I can't believe it...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' The sea... will engulf everyone. Just like the prophecy said...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Could Wriothesley have wanted to meet "Father" to figure out a way to deal with this crisis?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If you remember, I once mentioned that "Father" sees the House of the Hearth as her base of operations, and she truly wants to resolve the crisis. But how could Wriothesley have known that?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Or perhaps, he didn't know, and just wanted to bring "Father" over to his side? Which could be why he said he just wanted to "negotiate."
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Yeah, that makes sense to me. I understand your concerns as well, {{Traveler}}. I'll figure out a way to pass this on to our "Father." No matter what, we're on your side.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The two of you have already aided us far too much. We probably would not be standing here right now if not for you.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If you ever need anything else going forward, please come to the House of the Hearth at any time.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lyney 21.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Though you may not share the sentiment, after all that we've gone through together, the three of us basically see you as family now.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...You have my gratitude.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Thank you for protecting Lyney when it really mattered, and thank you for sharing the secrets of the Fortress with us. We didn't think you were going to do it.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why are you all being so formal all of a sudden?
:{{DIcon}} Don't mention it.
:{{DIcon}} We can work together again if necessary.
::{{A|vo fdaq108 1 lynette 09b 1.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Given your strength, you might not need our help at all. But if you are ever in danger, we will try our best to protect you.
::{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 07b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww! The sound of that makes Paimon feel all warm and safe inside!
:'''Paimon:''' *growl*...
:{{DIcon}} What was that?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... Paimon... Paimon's hungry...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' You've done so much already, go get some food!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, then we'll catch you guys another time!

;(Talk to Freminet, Lynette, or Lyney again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq108 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I feel like... I should try to become someone more capable of helping.
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq108 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You're incredibly helpful. Lyney thinks so too.
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq108 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yeah. You two are always telling me not to push myself, but aren't you just like that as well?
----
;(Approach the cafeteria)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 prisonbroadcast 01.ogg}} '''Prison Broadcast:''' It's time for dinner. Welfare Meals now being served in the Coupon Cafeteria!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, let's go pick up ours as well!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Ah, {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Over here!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you here for dinner too, Miss Sigewinne?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Mhm, and I'm taking the opportunity to prepare Miss Clorinde's dinner as well.
:{{Color|menu|You follow Sigewinne's gaze, and see that Clorinde is seated not far away...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, you're right... She's actually sitting in the fortress cafeteria...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' What would you like to eat?
:{{DIcon}} Huh? We can choose?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yep, you can! I've already talked to our chef, Mr. Wolsey. It's all on me today, so you can get whatever you'd like.
:{{DIcon}} Then I'll have the tastiest stuff you have to offer!
:{{DIcon}} Then I'll get the biggest portion you have to offer!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Me too, don't forget Paimon!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' No problem! Just leave it to me.
:{{Black Screen|After a while, the meals Sigewinne ordered for you arrive. Unlike days prior when you had to rely solely on luck, the dishes before you today are bursting with flavor.}}
:{{Black Screen|Sigewinne also brings some drinks over to you. They taste a little strange, but she insists that they are very nutritious... She also insists that Wriothesley is also a fan of them, but neither you nor Paimon buy her claims.}}
:{{Black Screen|...Okay, the shakes genuinely taste pretty terrible. At the very least, however, they help you to calm down and relax.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahhhh!! Sooo delicious!!
:{{DIcon}} Amazing!
::{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 06a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's so happy, Paimon wants to feast like this every day, hehe.
:{{DIcon}} Free dinners are the absolute best!
::{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 06b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this how it feels to be freeloaders? Wait a second, we did do plenty of work, after all...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Feeling full yet? How's the food?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Delicious!
:{{DIcon}} Exquisite, thank you!
:{{DIcon}} Besides the milk&mdash; Uh, I mean, everything was super delicious!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Aw, I'm so glad to see you all so happy! See, the expression on your face just now... The muscle here just moved, which suggests that you're feeling quite relaxed at the moment.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sigewinne, do you do this to help your patients, or to better understand human beings?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' A bit of both, I suppose. I'm a Melusine, which means I'm very different from human beings. I must know what you're thinking if I want to take good care of you.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're really good at taking care of people... Even though you're so short, you still talk and act like an older sister.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Really? You're reminded of an older sister? Hehe, that's great to hear.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and what did you mean back in Wriothesley's office, when you said that you were protecting Lyney and his siblings as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh, that? I just asked His Grace to look out for those children, especially that diver boy. I was getting a bit worried after hearing that something was wrong with the water...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 11.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Thankfully, Clorinde is very strong, and managed to save him in the nick of time. His Grace also sealed the pipes after Clorinde left to make sure that Lyney wouldn't impulsively chase after his brother.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 12.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Although the path was blocked, we still stationed some guards there to stop anyone from approaching. They were instructed to only open the door once Miss Clorinde had returned.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 13.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh, and I was keeping an eye on Mr. Lyney as well. We had to press him, but we couldn't allow him to be in any real danger.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You are all super considerate and really thought everything through...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 14.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hehe, it's just what we do down here at the Fortress. At least, this has been His Grace's style for as long as he's been the leader.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 15.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' *sigh* I really wish Monsieur Neuvillette would come down here more often too. I feel like he'd like it here... With all the darkness and chaos...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (But that doesn't make sense at all... It's hard to imagine Neuvillette outside of his office...)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 2 sigewinne 16.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Get a good night's rest, you two! You've both worked very hard.

;(Talk to Clorinde, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Clorinde!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Ah, it's you two.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How's dinner?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It's alright. Miss Sigewinne really put in a lot of effort.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we heard that Wriothesley invited you to come down to help and you saved Freminet, too. You sure work super fast.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It was child's play.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still, Paimon didn't know even Champion Duelists could take on side jobs...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh and, why aren't you eating with Sigewinne and the Duke? Won't you get bored eating by yourself?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Miss Sigewinne was with you, and the Duke has business of his own.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hm... Actually, didn't Navia say that you went out for dinner with her as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Yeah. First time in a long time.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "First time in a long time"? So you mean, you've gone out to dinner with her in the past?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' In the past, yes.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You seem to be enjoying yourselves here.
:{{DIcon}} It's all thanks to Neuvillette...
:{{DIcon}} This is technically a work trip for us too...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 3 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Things will be getting messy at the Fortress soon. Don't run around unnecessarily.
----
;(Approach the bed at the dormitories)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... So much has happened, Paimon just feels absolutely exhausted now that she's finally relaxed...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's super sleepy... Are you sleepy, too...?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I'm also getting there.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zzz... Zzz...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Wow, she really immediately fell asleep.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Delicious... Paimon wants seconds... For free!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Goodnight.)
:{{Color|menu|Half asleep, you seem to hear a loud noise from afar...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 4 prisoner4 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' Out of my way! Get out of my way!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 4 prisoner5 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' What happened? Why is everyone running?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 4 prisoner6 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' No idea, but something must've happened, stop asking...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh...? Who's yelling... Paimon still wants to sleep...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...!? What's that sound?)
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, wake up! We need to go out and see what's going on!

;(Leave the dormitories)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened, why is everyone running around... Hey! What are you doing?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 prisoner7 01.ogg}} '''Hurried Prisoner:''' No time to explain, mate! Goodbye!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? Hey, wait!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's wrong with these people!? They won't even talk to us!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 cuistot 01.ogg}} '''Cuistot:''' They're here! Ah, there you are!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 laverune 01.ogg}} '''Laverune:''' Thank goodness.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cuistot and Laverune? Do you know what happened here?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 cuistot 02.ogg}} '''Cuistot:''' We came here especially to inform you! Something seems to have gone terribly wrong just now, His Grace is telling everyone to evacuate and get out of here.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 cuistot 03.ogg}} '''Cuistot:''' Laverune was saying, you two are new here, and don't have many friends, so you might slip through the cracks. Haven't you heard of stories like that? An evacuation is successfully completed, yet you only find out once you do a headcount that one or two people are missing...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 laverune 02.ogg}} '''Laverune:''' Wait, weren't you the one who brought that up? Why is it suddenly my idea?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 cuistot 04.ogg}} '''Cuistot:''' Shut up!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 laverune 03.ogg}} '''Laverune:''' Okay, whatever. The point is, you should come with us.
:{{DIcon}} You said His Grace said to... evacuate "outwards"?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 laverune 04.ogg}} '''Laverune:''' Yeah, he said to get as far away as possible, upwards and outwards.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Then that means whatever happened must have happened down below... Oh no, isn't that gate at the very bottom!?)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, it can't be that thing!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 cuistot 05.ogg}} '''Cuistot:''' What? Hey! Where are you going!?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We have to go find the Duke! You two, just go and get out! Go on without us!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 5 laverune 05.ogg}} '''Laverune:''' Hey! Heyyy!&nbsp;...Be careful!

{{Cutscene Description|You and Paimon rush into the Forbidden Zone, and two solemn figures await you: Wriothesley and Clorinde.<br>At the bottom of the Forbidden Zone, a huge sluice gate trembles, the needle on the indicator swaying wildly near the very limit.<br>Suddenly, the tremendous water pressure overwhelms the four locks holding the sluice gate shut, and vast torrent of water breaks free and gushes forth. The surging Primordial Seawater rushes into the room like a fountain.<br>Wriothesley unleashes his full power, freezing the torrent of seawater into a pillar of ice. But the relief is temporary, as the torrent continues to rush up from below, surging past the layer of ice. Wriothesley knows his own ability to delay has reached its limit, and he turns and runs as fast as he can.<br>Beyond the isolation gates, Clorinde stands before you, and just as she agreed with Wriothesley, prepares to blast the gate controls the moment he makes good his escape.<br>In order to stop the seawater leaking through, all three isolation gates slam into place one after other, with Wriothesley barely making it through as the final gate shuts.<br>Faced with a torrent of water that threatens to overwhelm the isolation gates at any time, Wriothesley orders you to go to the overworld and find Neuvillette to resolve the crisis.<br>He and Clorinde resolve to stay put as the final line of defense...}}

:{{A|vo fdaq108 7 receptionist 02.ogg}} '''Receptionist:''' Though I'm sure he's already explained, this should be a mostly cordial conversation unlikely to give rise to violence, but it would be most appreciated if you could protect Lady Furina to the best of your abilities.
:{{DIcon}} I will do my best.

:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 furina 01a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo fdaq108 8 furina 01b.ogg}}--> '''Furina:''' Of course, of course! How could they not attend a meeting such as this? I must always have two or more guests at my dessert table, otherwise the occasion would be too lonely and unbecoming of my station.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 02.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It is my pleasure to make your acquaintance, {{Traveler}}, I have heard much of your accomplishments. I am The Knave, one of the eleven Fatui Harbingers.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (So this is The Knave... the head of the House of the Hearth, and the Lyney siblings' "Father." She certainly does not seem easy to deal with.)
:{{DIcon}} Greetings.
:{{DIcon}} Pleasure to meet you, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I've already prepared seats for you. Come, sit beside me.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Perhaps you two are unaware of how Miss Furina and I do things. You see, we actually recently agreed to get together for tea when we had the time.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' See this? This is a limited type of confectionery that Miss Furina simply adores. There are only sixteen slices sold every day. Here, why don't you and Paimon have a taste?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (She seems friendly enough, but that can't be all there is to her... The Knave is a force to be reckoned with. I should be very cautious around her.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' {{Traveler}}, what do you think of this cake?
:{{DIcon}} It's pretty good.
:{{DIcon}} It's quite tasty, and I think Paimon agrees too.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' That's good to hear. So what Childe said was on the mark after all... you do share a taste in desserts with Furina and I.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Wait, Childe should have no reason to have said something like that.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I wonder how he's doing nowadays. You must have heard, right? He's suddenly gone missing. I'm really worried about his safety, you know. Here's to hoping that he's an excellent swimmer.
:{{DIcon}} I have faith in his abilities.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Uh... Since we're talking about him, I feel like I should add something. His martial prowess really looked... certainly pretty impressive, yeah!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Furina looks quite nervous... There must be some kind of bad blood between her and The Knave.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Oh, so you're also familiar with his aptitude for fighting, Miss Furina? Ah, right, I almost forgot. Childe was subdued by Iudex Neuvillette right in front of you.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Against ordinary people, my colleague would never be on the back foot, but alas, he just never imagined he'd run into such a person... Hmm... I must express my admiration for Monsieur Neuvillette.
:{{DIcon}} I managed to find a few leads on his whereabouts.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Hmm. Coming from you, that's not surprising at all.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Eh? But... I thought you would be happier to hear the news...?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Of course, but it's still a bit of a shame. You see, I would have been far happier had I received this news somewhat earlier. As you well know, a long time has passed since Childe disappeared.

:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Oh? And just how do you know that?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Because... Because we found evidence that proved he left the Fortress of Meropide!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 12.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' And where did he go after leaving the Fortress?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Oh no... Paimon's statement just left us wide open...)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 13.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' The Fortress of Meropide lies deep beneath the waves. Unless he pranced right out of the main gate, he must have had to swim for it. Do you have any proof that he surfaced safely?
:{{DIcon}} ...We do not.
::{{DIcon}} But there was also no evidence that he's been injured or killed.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 14.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Ah, that is good news at least. His sister [[Tonia]] sent a letter to Fontaine not too long ago. Since he was unfortunately unavailable, I picked it up on his behalf.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 arlecchino 15.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Do you have any idea how he usually writes back to his family? "Dear Tonia, your letter made me feel like we were still enjoying our time in Snezhnaya together. I'm currently admiring the scenery on the streets in front of the opera house..." Is it something like that?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (She's turning up the pressure, I'm not sure if I'll be able to convince her... But I can at least try to distract her from Furina.)
::{{DIcon}} That sounds good to me, yes.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 8 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' All letters tend to follow the same few formats anyway, right? As long as the contents are accurate, it doesn't matter so much how it's written, or how it's worded...

:{{A|vo fdaq108 9 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I figured you would have at least brought a few people along for appearances' sake. It appears I underestimated just how confidential the mission was.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 9 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Shouldn't you have gotten used to confidential missions by now? That's just how the courts operate.

:{{A|vo fdaq108 9 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' He already has tons of tea in his office. I'm thinking about a set of legal codices.

:{{A|vo fdaq108 9 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I'm sure His Grace doesn't consider the Fortress to be outside the law.

:{{Color|menu|Neuvillette looks pensive...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 9 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Anyway, you've still got some unfinished business to attend to in the overworld, correct?

:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 02.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Miss Furina. As the Hydro Archon, I am sure you understand the exact meaning of the phenomenon we just witnessed. Or should I say, that's what I originally thought, but looking at your expression... was I wrong, and you haven't a clue?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...What are you trying to say?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' At this point, I don't think there's any more need to speak as diplomatic representatives. Allow me to speak to you now as just a Fontainian: You know the prophecy by heart, and also that every part of it is being proven true.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Yet here you are relaxing, drinking tea and eating desserts as if it's all nothing more than a few stray bugs in your garden. Do you really think that's acceptable?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' The prophecy's hanging above our necks like a guillotine. Every faction is looking for a way to either avert the disaster, or save their own. Even the orphans of the House of the Hearth have devoted everything to saving their homeland.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' But you? It beggars belief just how nonchalant and carefree you have been. From the very beginning, you, the god Focalors... You have utterly failed to take action.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You're wrong... I've never ignored the prophecy, nor have I just been passing the time in self-indulgence. Retract your accusation, and stop doubting the wisdom of the gods with such absurd conjectures!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I am not alone in my doubts, you know. All the children of Fontaine may be harboring the exact same thoughts right now.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' O great Hydro Archon, how are you going to save them? Save us? How are the people you've sworn to protect supposed to survive in a land that will soon disappear beneath the waves?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I have my ways, and I've been working on them for all this time... Even if you look down upon me, you have no right to judge me!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Fontaine will be saved. Even... Even if I still cannot see the true future right now, as long as I continue on as I am, I will be able to hold my head up high!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Furina's not acting like her usual self. She's actually seriously refuting The Knave's accusations... She means what she says. She's not putting on a front.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Then I ask you, Miss Furina, just what have you been working on? Where can we see it, and what is it doing to help?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...I...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...So was that all a lie? Or can she really not tell us? She was so full of conviction and confidence just now, but now she's deflated like a popped balloon.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...My machinations are just like the prophecy itself &mdash; they will only reveal themselves at the fated time. It is just that beings like yourselves are unable to perceive them as of yet.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I see. As a god, the proof of your labor always lies beyond prying mortal eyes.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Allow me to be so bold as to ask another way. Would it be possible for you to tell us the parts of your plan that are not confidential? Such as... your emergency response plan for the impending disaster.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Uh... An emergency response plan...?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 12.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Ah, that look in your eyes... Have you not even prepared one of those?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The... The emergency response plan is also strictly confidential.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 13.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Then allow me to jog your memory. Miss Furina, what is the purpose of your [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]]?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 14.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' And what do you plan to do with the massive amounts of [[Indemnitium]] that it has accumulated over the years?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' T&mdash;The Oratrice? It... It's just like it appears to be...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 15.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Hmph, so you also have no idea? If I'm not mistaken, someone's using it to prepare for something. But unfortunately, it would seem that someone is not you, Miss Furina.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 16.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I first caught wind of this when Lyney tried to investigate the Oratrice in the opera house. You see, even just getting close to the core contaminated him with an extremely large amount of Indemnitium.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 17.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' But if even that had nothing to do with you... Then what could you possibly be working on, O great Hydro Archon?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 18.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Oh, right, I almost forgot. Iudex Neuvillette is not at the tea party with us today. Miss Furina, I suppose you must have ordered him away to take care of some troublesome business.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, yeah, yes, that's exactly right! Please keep it a secret for me.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 19.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Of course I will. Although I must say, Miss Furina, you seem quite insecure without the Iudex by your side.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 20.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Very well, let's stop that conversation here. There are still a few slices of cake left, so please help yourselves, everyone.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (These aren't topics I can speak about... I don't even know what Neuvillette's task was.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (If I had to guess, he probably went down to deal with the surging Primordial Sea... But can he really deal with it all by himself?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (And is Furina being truthful or not?)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 21.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' {{Traveler}}, I heard that you were recently commissioned to handle a few matters on behalf of the Iudex. Why don't you take an extra slice of cake? Those who work hard deserve gratitude and praise.

:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Mhm-mmm, if it's on my tea table, it must be of the highest quality. Ah, yes, and we must thank The Knave for bringing these over as well.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 23.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You're welcome. I'm sure the cake also felt greatly honored to be featured at Miss Furina's table. And I was merely catering to Miss Furina's tastes, seeking a chance to chat over tea.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 24.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It is getting late. Why don't we call it a day? There are still a few matters that I need to take care of, so I must take my leave now.

:{{A|vo fdaq108 10 arlecchino 25.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Mind seeing me off, {{Traveler}}? We could use the opportunity to discuss Childe before I must be on my way.

:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You dare to run from me? Stop right this instant!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 14.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (My goal is just to discover the location of the Gnosis, but I didn't expect the chance to approach Furina to be handed to me on a silver platter. This is so easy, it's actually making me a bit suspicious...)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 15.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (Anything left unguarded is usually just bait. But no one will blame someone for taking the bait. After all, from the moment it was attached to the hook, the bait is meant to be sacrificed.)
:[[File:Calamitous Tread Graphic 3.png|200px]]
:{{Color|menu|Furina is utterly unable to resist, collapsing on the ground in utter panic...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Waaaaaah!
:[[File:Calamitous Tread Graphic 4.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 16.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (It's just as I guessed in the second before I struck. The Hydro Gnosis is not currently held by the Archon...)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 17.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (In fact, this "archon" doesn't seem like a god at all... And I sense that she's under some kind of curse...)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Who are you? A&mdash;And wh&mdash;what are you trying to do? Please don't kill me, I'm begging you, please...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 18.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (The fear in her pupils is genuine, so perhaps she is not bait after all. Either way, targeting her has lost all meaning.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 19.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 20.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (I left the scene with ease. Nobody came looking me, and nobody could serve as a witness to my near-assassination of Focalors. I suspect even Furina dares not mention this incident to anyone.)
:[[File:Calamitous Tread Graphic 5.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 21.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (Not long after, my informants confirmed what I had guessed: After returning to her quarters, Furina quietly cried alone. She was so scared that she could not sleep that night, nor could she even bring herself to eat her cake.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 22.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (There's no doubt that there's something wrong with her. I began to entertain the possibility that she is not the true Hydro Archon &mdash; perhaps Iudex Neuvillette is actually the genuine article.)
:[[File:Calamitous Tread Graphic 6.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 23.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (I have to find the Gnosis. If the Neuvillette hypothesis is correct, he is probably in possession of it. Alternatively, it might have been hidden in a place that's hard for ordinary people to access.)
:{{Color|menu|The Knave summons Lyney and the others...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, "Father"!
:[[File:Calamitous Tread Graphic 7.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 24.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' My dear children. Please speak.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' News from the Fortress of Meropide. Master... Master Childe has gone missing. On top of that, the contacts and guards we bribed at the Fortress have all gone quiet as well...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 25.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' ...Probably the handiwork of that Wriothesley.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I'm afraid so.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 26.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' This is a good opportunity. The value of a Harbinger is much higher than most would imagine. We now have an excuse to exert diplomatic pressure on the Fontaine authorities.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 27.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Set up a meeting for me. I would like to meet the Hydro Archon and Iudex Neuvillette.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 28.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Oh, and I have an additional mission for you three.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 together 01.ogg}} '''Lyney, Lynette & Freminet:''' Yes, "Father"!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 29.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (Tartaglia's disappearance was not a part of my plan, but I can use it to make a breakthrough. With this as my excuse, I can ask for an official audience, and continue my investigation of Furina and Iudex Neuvillette.)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 11 arlecchino 30.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' (The initiative belongs to the House of the Hearth. My wish to investigate the Fortress of Meropide will be a front. Lyney and his group will be responsible for the actual intelligence-gathering.)
:;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 01.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You should know the rest. Lyney's group is quite close to you, so they wouldn't have hidden anything from you.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You attacked the Hydro Archon?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 02.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It wouldn't mean anything even if you shouted it from the rooftops. After all, even Furina herself is still pretending that nothing of that sort ever happened.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, alright then...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I've now had two chances to enjoy tea with Furina. I have to say, the leadership of Fontaine is even more inscrutable than I had imagined. I once surmised that Iudex Neuvillette must be the Hydro Archon, but now, that doesn't seem right to me either.
:{{DIcon}} How did you come to that conclusion?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I am a servant of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa. Over my years of service, I've learned how a real Archon conducts and carries themselves. Whether Iudex Neuvillette or Furina, neither fits the bill. It's hard to imagine either of them as the Archon.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Of course, that is all just how I feel. Gut feelings often do not require justification.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It is, however, quite amusing to me that after all my years working in intelligence gathering, I've come to realize I am at a complete loss regarding the identity of the god of the land of my birth.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Don't you think Fontaine is quite intriguing? A catastrophe looms, yet many secrets have yet to rise to the surface. It looks like Fontainians will have no choice but to save themselves.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Ultimately, though, one must survive in order to do anything else. Should the need arise, I would be happy to cooperate with you.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You don't need to commit to anything right now, of course. I have a feeling that the situation will continue to evolve. And as your name is often connected with noble deeds, I'm sure we will work together someday.
:{{Color|menu|Neuvillette comes over...}}
:{{DIcon}} ...Neuvillette?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' He certainly returned quickly. You must want to catch up with each other, so I'll leave you to him.
:{{Color|menu|The Knave unhurriedly leaves...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Neuvillette, is it over?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' For now, yes, but this issue will prove quite thorny in the long term. I am concerned that sooner or later, the prophesized events will occur...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thank you for protecting Furina.
:{{DIcon}} May we ask what happened down there?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Mmm... To put it simply, I used my power to force back the Primordial Sea and re-seal the sluice gate.
:{{DIcon}} As for what happened on our side...
:{{Black Screen|You recount the happenings of the tea party to Neuvillette...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...So, as expected, The Knave has turned up the pressure on Furina. She's trying to feel her out, though I'm still unsure as to her motives.
:{{DIcon}} Can I ask you some questions?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Permission granted.
:{{DIcon}} You have enough power to force back the Primordial Sea...
:{{DIcon}} Does this mean you have some deeper connection with the Hydro Archon?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, it can't be that you're the real Hydro Archon, right? But that's just a speculation on our part, though...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can't tell us? Then... Then that's okay, we can talk about something else, we won't try to force you... Hahaha, you guys in Fontaine are super strange...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If by the phrase "you guys" you are referring to Furina and I, then although I'm not sure just what you are trying to imply, I must clarify that I do not share her positions on a multitude of topics.
:{{DIcon}} What did you sense in the Fortress of Meropide?
:{{DIcon}} Did you manage to protect those that needed to be defended?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I believe so. The Fortress has a long and complex history. It has seen much grief and suffering.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...And now, another catastrophe will soon be upon us. I mourn this turn of events.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why is it raining all of a sudden?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The clear skies suddenly filled with dark clouds. The rain became heavier, light rain soon growing to a downpour.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (And just moments before, Neuvillette has just mentioned his sense of grief.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Thinking back to that legend, and what Freminet said... "It's said that a Dragon of Water once resided in Fontaine. Every time it weeps, the skies will cloud up and pour out rain.")
:{{DIcon}} Wait, Neuvillette, you can't be...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...You may be closer to the truth than you think.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and what are you thinking?
:{{DIcon}} ...He's the Dragon Sovereign of Water.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Dragon of... Huh wha!?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...HUUUUUUUUUHHHH???
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please do not be so surprised...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...Furina?
:{{Color|menu|Furina steals a glance at you from afar before quickly leaving herself.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Villette! Neuvillette! Are you listening?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Ah, my apologies.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were just guessing randomly... We didn't guess right, did we? You're not actually the Dragon Sovereign of Water, right? Well, if you don't want to confirm or deny...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You guessed correctly. I sincerely hope you'll be able to keep this a secret for me.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... right! Of course! We'll definitely help you keep it a secret!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's still something Paimon wants to ask you, though...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please go ahead.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if you are the Dragon Sovereign of Water, and you were able to force back the Primordial Sea from the Fortress...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then since Fontaine's prophecy is all about seawater, couldn't you just use your power to solve the crisis?
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' None of the currently living dragon sovereigns in the world, myself included, possess our full dragonhood.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' They say that when the [[First Usurper]] arrived on Teyvat, they seized a part of the dragons' power. Today, that stolen power is the basis of the Archons' Authorities.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There are seven elemental Archons, and seven matching Dragon Sovereigns...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The Dragon Sovereign of Water who lived through that era perished a long time ago. As their successor, I know far less of that part of our ancient history.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 20.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In any case, I believe I will not be able to do much unless the Archon disappears and returns their elemental Authority to me.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 21.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Given the status quo, however, I would recommend finding another way to deal with the prophecy.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... So even you can't solve it...
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 22.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I still have some urgent matters to attend to at my office. If you have any more questions regarding ancient history, you are welcome to discuss them with me at a later time.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, please go right ahead! There's a place that Paimon wants to go, too. Traveler, why don't we pay another visit to the Fortress of Meropide? Paimon is a little worried...
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:{{DIcon}} See you later, Neuvillette.
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll see you another time!
:{{A|vo fdaq108 12 neuvillette 23.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Take care.
