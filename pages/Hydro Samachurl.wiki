==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Splash:''' Summons water that bursts from the ground at the player's location, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
*'''Soothing Rain:''' Summons rain that applies the {{Color|Wet}} status to any players or allies within its AoE, while also [[healing]] its allies within the AoE by up to ~60% of their max [[Health|HP]]. This ability does not deal DMG.
** Certain enhanced Hydro Samachurls, found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges, will create rainclouds that follow their healing targets around.
*'''Smack:''' If the player is within melee range, swings its staff at the player, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and knocking the player back. The Samachurl also falls in the process due to the staff's weight. The Samachurl will not perform this attack while it is on top of a pillar.
