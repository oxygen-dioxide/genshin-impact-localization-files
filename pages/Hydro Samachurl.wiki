{{Enemy Attacks

|name_1 = Tidal Impact
|file_1 = Hydro Samachurl Splash
|desc_1 = Summons water that bursts from the ground at the player's location, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.

|name_2 = Prayer for Rain
|desc_2 = Summons rain that applies the {{Color|Wet}} status to any players or allies within its AoE, while also [[healing]] its allies within the AoE by up to '''~60%''' of their max [[Health|HP]]. This ability does not deal DMG.
* Certain enhanced Hydro Samachurls, found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges, will create rainclouds that follow their healing targets around.

|name_3 = Staff Strike
|desc_3 = If the player is within melee range, swings its staff at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and knocking the player back. The Samachurl also falls in the process due to the staff's weight. The Samachurl will not perform this attack while it is on top of a pillar.
