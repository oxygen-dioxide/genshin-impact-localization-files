{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bricole:''' Oh! You again.
:{{DIcon}} About Coutrot...
::'''Bricole:''' Just being kicked out of the Fontaine Research Institute didn't bring him to his senses. He really is pigheaded.
::'''Bricole:''' But nobody is backing him now, so you can relax. He can't cause any more trouble.
::{{DIcon}} Anyway, who is Kuisel?
::'''Bricole:''' I don't know either. I don't recall anyone by that name at the Fontaine Research Institute... Perhaps, as far as he's concerned, it's better that nobody by that name exists?
::'''Bricole:''' Just like he said himself, Kuisel was just a convenient character. The more different that character was from himself, the better, as it made it less likely anyone would recognize him... Although that's just a guess of mine.
::'''Bricole:''' *Sigh* If you ask me, though, I think he changed enough over the years as it is. I didn't recognize him at first.
:{{DIcon}} About the device here...
::'''Bricole:''' It's puzzling, isn't it? It seems like he's made... uh... various modifications to this place.
::'''Bricole:''' Now it feels more suited to some ancient ruins that tourists might visit... Although perhaps it isn't too prudent to say it like that.
::'''Bricole:''' *Ahem* The aforementioned viewpoint is only my personal opinion, and is not representative of the Fontaine Research Institute or its viewpoints.
:{{DIcon}} I'll let you work.
::'''Bricole:''' Leaving so soon? Okay...
::'''Bricole:''' *sigh* This place starts to feel scary if you're alone here for too long...
