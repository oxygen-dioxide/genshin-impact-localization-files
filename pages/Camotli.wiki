{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Camotli:''' Hmm... What should I put in today's healthy meal?
:{{DIcon}} Healthy meal?
::'''Camotli:''' Yes&mdash; Seriously? What are you giving me that look for? "Healthy" doesn't necessarily mean "unpalatable."
::'''Camotli:''' As long as it satisfies your body's needs, any food can be considered healthy. After all, different people have different nutritional requirements.
::'''Camotli:''' In fact, if it doesn't taste good, it really shouldn't be considered healthy at all! Am I right?
::'''Camotli:''' Anyway, back to the matter at hand &mdash; are we going to eat [[Grilled Fish in Mint Sauce]] with [[Grainfruit Chips]], or Meat Stew with Volcano Braised Rice...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Any food recommendations?
:::'''Camotli:''' Food recommendations... Hmm, you're probably no super hungry yet, are you? How about some [[Puffed Grainfruit Bars]] to get those tastebuds going?
:::'''Camotli:''' Healthy, delicious, and relatively easy to make! This one's on me &mdash; and trust me, nutritious meals aren't anywhere near as bad as some people make them out to be!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Recipe: Puffed Grainfruit Bars}})
:{{DIcon}}Goodbye.
::'''Camotli:''' Goodbye. I hope you have a wonderful day!
