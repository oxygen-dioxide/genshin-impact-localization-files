{{Quote|Like most of Mondstadt's young people, Noelle always dreamed of being a knight of Favonius when she grew up.<br />She may not have what it takes to be a knight just yet, but she is learning. Working as a maid at the Knights' headquarters, she is constantly taking notes on what constitutes knightly speech, knightly conduct, and knightly customs.<br />She holds firm to her belief that one day she will join their ranks &mdash; she just needs to keep trying her hardest at everything she does.|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/mondstadt?char=10 Noelle]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|A maid who faithfully serves the Knights of Favonius. She dreams of joining their ranks someday.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Noelle is a polite young woman and professional maid, helping those in need without hesitation, regardless of how far they are or what they need done, as long as they say her name. She has a very high standard of work ethic, as she always strives to ensure that everyones' needs are satisfied and always makes the effort to go over their expectations. No work is a problem for her; [[Lisa]] believes that the more work she is given, the happier she is.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Lisa|About Noelle}}</ref>

Despite this, she is relatively stubborn and inexperienced; she states that she is useless in an argument and simply does what she believes is best, regardless of the other party's advice. Likewise, her attempts to meet everyone's needs is double-edged; although most people are genuine, others can take advantage of her generosity. [[Jean]] also considers her to be eligible for the Knights, but refrains from knighting her because she is worried that she is not ready for what lies outside Mondstadt.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Jean|About Noelle}}</ref>

She looks up to all of the Knights and asks them for advice on how to be a proper member when she officially joins, regardless of how much experience they may have, such as the rambunctious [[Klee]]. Her aspiration of joining them means that she will refuse any other invitations offered to her.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Bennett|About Noelle}}</ref>

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Noelle possesses a short stature and petite build, which contrasts the big and heavy weapon she carries in-game. She has short, neck-length pale lavender hair with a straight fringe and lopsided locks of hair framing her face. A section of hair is braided over her bangs and pinned down at the right side of her face with a gold shield clip. Her eyes are olive green.

As for wear, Noelle has the typical maid ensemble with the exception of a priestess hat, a cravat, and many fuchsia roses, which she wears as to remind herself to never leak confidential information. Her fuchsia dress has two bows, one at her hip and the other on her rear, the latter of which her Geo Vision is sat on top of. Gilded white armor plating adorns her chest and she wears a pauldron upon her left shoulder. She also wears black tights beneath her armored boots. Her outfit, [[Armored Rose]], is described to be heavy and durable velvet and metal plates.

▌Maid of Favonius · Noelle<br />
A Maid's Job Knows No Bounds

<nowiki>========================</nowiki>

Many people in Mondstadt think there's something a little bit magical about Noelle: She seems to have the ability to be everywhere at once, and to do absolutely anything she sets her mind to.

Whether it's a Knights of Favonius dinner party, a winery banquet, or just an ordinary barbecue, Noelle is a whirlwind of helpfulness that will burst through your door at the first sign of a problem and whisk it away for you.

It's no wonder that people have taken to calling her the "Wondermaid."

But ask Noelle and she'll tell you there's nothing wondrous about the way she works, let alone magical. She just takes pride in her work and is constantly in pursuit of perfection.

"Nothing more, nothing less. Just as it should be, and not as it should not be."

If there's anything that you need, Noelle is glad to be of aid.</p>

|text2         = <p>Noelle is "the maid of all maids" to many.</p><p>Such people also tend to say this of her: "She's everywhere."</p><p>For example, there was a child who once tried to get a plate during a banquet, but found that there was no way to open the cabinet without all the plates falling out...</p><p>"Noelle!!!!!!"</p><p>All the child needed to do was scream, and Noelle appeared. She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up other plates, and then put them back in order.</p><p>Noelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.</p><p>However, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter.</p><p>"No more, no less. As it should be, not as it should not be."</p><p>Noelle doesn't think herself special, only that she thinks too much at times.</p>

|text3         = <p>Noelle is always eager to help, sometimes excessively so.</p><p>If you were to ask her how to build a campfire as she passed by, she would not only stop and build the campfire for you, she would also put up the grill racks, season the food, cook it for you, taste it herself to make sure it's done, and remind you to put out the fire when you've finished so as not to burn the forest down. Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.</p><p>Of course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...</p><p>For example, a [[Landa|merchant]] from [[Snezhnaya]] once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.</p><p>He disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.</p><p>Initially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.</p><p>Noelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that [[Tia|his daughter]] liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.</p><p>This spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?</p><p>In the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.</p><p>Noelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously.</p>

It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.</p><p>However, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.</p><p>At the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.</p><p>The adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.</p><p>It was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.</p><p>In order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, [[Jean]] had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then [[Kaeya]] would have to save the day.</p><p>During the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few "urgent matters" for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over.</p>

|text5         = <p>Noelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength.</p><p>This does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength.</p><p>Once, [[Lisa]] accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand &mdash; and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.</p><p>There was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by [[Pyro Slimes]] as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue &mdash; hurling the carts &mdash; cargo and all, into the [[Cider Lake]], before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.</p><p>Rumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent [[Wagner]] &mdash; who prided himself in his forging skills &mdash; into despairing seclusion.</p><p>In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.</p><p>At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.</p><p>Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy [[claymore]] that was further reinforced by her affinity for [[Geo]]. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.</p><p>But don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.</p><p>They say, however, that the very day Noelle received her [[Favonius Greatsword|custom-made claymore]], she was set upon by a pair of drunken [[Treasure Hoarders]] in [[Drunkard Gorge]], who thought her a harmless lamb...</p><p>Let's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky.</p>

During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.</p><p>It's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.</p><p>The crispy [[Moon Pie]]s; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering [["Pile 'Em Up"|Pile 'Em Ups]] &mdash; all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.</p><p>The smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh.</p><p>For the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol.</p><p>The festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning.</p>

These things are all top secret.</p><p>To avoid leaking such information, Noelle used red cloth to make a great many roses &mdash; in Mondstadt, this flower means "my lips are sealed."</p><p>She specially wove one such rose into her gauntlet as an ever-present reminder to herself.</p><p>Revealing secrets would be a major dereliction of duty for a maid, and those who aspire to be knights cannot afford such errors.</p><p>So you can forget about probing Noelle for any secrets.

Some years ago, after failing her seventh selection test, which was really a foregone conclusion, she felt somewhat discouraged.</p><p>The etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?</p><p>She had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.</p><p>At that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.</p><p>Without a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.</p><p>Immediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.</p><p>But just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.</p><p>After a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.</p><p>This was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.</p><p>Her hard work had been remembered after all.</p><p>From that day forward, [[Vision]] in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable &mdash; and yes, everywhere at once too.</p>
