==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Dwarkanath:''' It seems like a lot of merchant ships have been coming and going lately. I wonder if any of them sell weapons...
:{{DIcon}} You want to buy a weapon?
::'''Dwarkanath:''' I'm fine myself, I already have a handy one. It's just that my brother [[Iradj]] is always going on about how he wants a [[Claymore]] and he asked me to keep an eye out for one.
::'''Dwarkanath:'''  Strange, just where can I buy a sword that's not only fit for purpose, but also looks nice? I asked him why he wants it, but he just hemmed and hawed without giving me a clear answer...
::'''Dwarkanath:'''  Ah! Maybe he wants to buy it as a gift for a girl somewhere? But... which girl would want a greatsword as a gift?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Dwarkanath:''' See you around.
