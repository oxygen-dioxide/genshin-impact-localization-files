==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Betresa:''' Our previous leader, Lord Bamoun...
:{{DIcon}} Hey there. You mentioned Bamoun, didn't you?
:'''Betresa:''' Ah, greetings, [[Traveler]].
:'''Betresa:''' Ah, I know of you. Indeed, we all know about the journey you, Lord [[Cyno]], and Sir [[Tighnari]] made to our Temple. We thank you all for making that decision.
:{{DIcon}} We didn't do anything... No need to thank us.
:'''Betresa:''' You may not know this, but Lord Bamoun and I were very close friends.
:'''Betresa:''' I'm usually in charge of day-to-day matters, and after he fell ill, caring for Lord Bamoun often fell to me.
:'''Betresa:''' As you see, I am hardly young myself and have lived here all my life...
:'''Betresa:''' Here, we keep secrets and shoulder our duties. To put things nicely, we have our principles. To be blunter about it... We have nowhere else to go.
:'''Betresa:''' Lord Bamoun and I have spent our whole lives in the desert. He was full of life and boldness in his youth, just like you, and thus became our leader.
:'''Betresa:''' I sometimes feel that he was always searching for a way to better the lives of all humans.
:'''Betresa:''' It was for this purpose that he obtained the Ba Fragments to protect our faith &mdash; the contest with you, your companions, and Sir [[Cyrus (Sumeru)|Cyrus]] was part of it too.
:{{DIcon}} You believe that he intended all this?
:'''Betresa:''' Though I am not sure what you are referring to specifically, I would think so.
:'''Betresa:''' Lord Bamoun had hoped for change to come all his life, which is why he treasured his relationship with Sir Cyrus.
:'''Betresa:''' He believed that the challenges he took upon himself could bring the changes to the current situation that we needed.
:'''Betresa:''' And as you have seen, Lord [[Sethos]] has succeeded him as our new leader.
:'''Betresa:''' As surely as we have eyes to witness it, the [[Akademiya]] and the [[Temple of Silence]] shall begin building bridges between them once more... It comes a little late, but I believe it is what Lord Bamoun desired.
:'''Betresa:''' He and his grandson, Lord Sethos, were very close, and they must have agreed on this long ago.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for explaining.
:'''Betresa:''' Think nothing of it, Traveler. As I see it, you, too, represent many possibilities, and I am glad to have met you here.
:'''Betresa:''' Lord Sethos, too, says that you are a friend to us and the Temple. Stay a while if you have time. I imagine all of us would be glad of it.
