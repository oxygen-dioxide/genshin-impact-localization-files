{{Quote|Star of the [[Zubayr Theater]]. Her dance is as graceful as a water lily in first bloom, pure and pristine.<br>But she is by no means a haughty and cold person. Even the most hurried traveler will not forget her innocent and radiant smile.|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/sumeru?char=5 Nilou]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|The star of Zubayr Theater. She is full of warmth and innocence, and her dances are lively and elegant.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Nilou is extremely polite to just about everyone she meets, especially when she's off-stage. She is highly skilled in dancing, being the main star of the Zubayr Theater. She is patient and helpful, guiding people through issues they have step-by-step and offering ways to relieve stress.

However, she is extremely protective of the arts and the right people have over self-expression with said arts, and is not afraid to fight for what she believes in.

She enjoys sweets, seeing them as a way to make people happy. On the other hand, she despises mushrooms; she has trauma after eating a poisonous mushroom and is unable to discern the differences between poisonous and non-poisonous mushrooms.

==Appearance==
{{See also|Neither Flower Nor Mist|Breeze of Sabaa}}
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Nilou uses the [[:Category:Medium Female Characters|medium female]] model. She has fair skin, bright red hair that is shoulder-length in front and goes past her hips at the back, and light aqua eyes. She also has a red tattoo in the shape of a lotus flower on her back, which is only present on her default outfit.

{{Quote|What's so great about that little theater? If she went with me on tour all around [[Teyvat]], she could earn so much Mora, more than what she could ever dream of... Alas, she's too innocent. So innocent that she knows nothing of her own worth.|[[Dori]]}}
If you have time, don't miss the performance at the Zubayr Theater.

Against a backdrop of lights and music, Nilou's graceful demeanor resembles that of an unsullied lotus flower, her delicate dance leading the audience into a world of fantasy.

When the performance comes to an end, the audience is brought back to reality, often in a trance.

"The girl dancing on stage is so beautiful, she looks straight out of a fairy tale."

But those who are close to Nilou know that she is very different from the aloof image she portrays on stage.

Once Nilou steps off the stage, she is like any girl her age: sweet, warm, and smiling.

If you meet Nilou off-stage, don't be intimidated. Say hello to her, and she'll be very happy about it.

              --><p>It was only when the dance had ended that little Nilou realized what she had done, and hurriedly apologized to the people around her who had made room.</p><!--
              --><p>It was at this moment that her teacher also walked down from the stage in an elegant manner and helped her pick the Yalda Candies back up.</p><!--
              --><p>She reached out her hand to little Nilou, and asked gracefully&mdash;</p><!--

              --><p>Nilou can often find good reasons to go with any of the options she is considering, and so they are like Forest Tree Frogs sitting across from one another with bellies out, not one able to win the others over.</p><!--
              --><p>But if there was a person who could make a decision at this time and tell her with confidence and calm:</p><!--

              --><p>During her free time when there are no shows or rehearsals, Nilou will read every letter carefully, share this joy with the other members of the Zubayr Theater, and then carefully preserve these letters.</p><!--

              --><p>Like dewdrops on a lotus leaf, a Hydro Vision had appeared at her waist.</p><!--

==Trivia==
* Nilou's style of dance is likely inspired by various forms of traditional Iranic dances.
** Her dance in ''[[The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings]]'' in addition to the dance moves featured in her [[Dance of Haftkarsvar|Elemental Skill]] and [[Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring|Elemental Burst]] appear to be based on the {{w|Iranian dance|classical Persian court dance}}. Particularly evident is the emphasis on graceful hand and arm movements, which is characteristic of this style of dancing.
** Additionally, the whirling motions, lotus motifs, as well as drum beats featured in Nilou's dances may also reference elements of the {{w|Sogdian Whirl dance}} {{Lang|zh=胡旋舞|zh_rm=Hú-xuánwǔ}}, an ancient Iranian folk dance that was popularized in China during the Tang Dynasty. The dance, likely brought over to China by Sogdian merchant-dancers who settled down in the region, was popularized in the court as well as among the common people.<ref>The Sogdians: [https://sogdians.si.edu/sogdian-dancer Sodgian Dancer]</ref>
* Nilou is known by these aliases or titles:
** Forest Fairy<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Story Begins in a Forest Without Rain}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* Nilou may be derived from {{lang|{{w|Niloufar}}|fa=نیلوفر}}, a Persian female name meaning "blue lotus" or "water lily," which is a traditional symbol of Anahita, a Zoroastrian goddess, hence the lotus motif in her name and back tattoo.<!--
