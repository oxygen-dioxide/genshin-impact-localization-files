{{Description|An icy flower fashioned from northland jade. Over the course of its long life, its petals have crumbled to dust.}}
'''Deep Gallery's Echoing Song''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Finale of the Deep Galleries]].

==Description==
Following her [[Surtalogi|master]]'s guidance, the [[Skirk|girl]] ventured northward, traversing the freezing wastelands and the corridor of fractured mirrors at the edge of the frozen sea.<br>After slaying countless monsters that wandered the ruins, finally, before the withered husk of a [[Irminsul|silver tree]], she caught a glimpse of treasure concealed beneath drifting snow. 

That was when the silver moonlight had yet to be shattered in the fires of war, when the divine prophecies of the [[Celestia|heavens]] still extended over the land.<br>The [[Voyager|youth]] who had ventured deep into the earth's bowels met the [[first angel]], inquiring about the most forbidden origins of the world.<br>The dawn-daughter trembled at these profane words, not knowing how this mortal had uncovered such a closely-kept secret,<br>But her visitor laid bare his origins before her, singing to her dreams of beauty that had never yet graced her mind.

In an instant, the fetters laid upon her by the [[Heavenly Principles|enthroned ruler]] broke apart like a spider's web; for the first time, she discovered what it meant to serve herself,<br>And to the one she loved, she poured out the matter of creation, that most forbidden of unspeakable secrets. 

"Alas that your ruler would dare to blaspheme such noble beings."<br>"Even the demonic sculptors of bloody nightmares, who delight in tormenting souls, would be taken aback by such cruelty."<br>"O dawn-maiden who has never known love, let me stand as the enemy to your laws."<br>"Raise your eyes to the stars, as you should, for the sake of all beings imprisoned by your ruler."

"Let me be your sword, your shield, your guide, your unpardonable conspirator in rebellion."<br>Then did she, most exalted of the [[angel]]s, bend down and kiss his forehead, as countless icy blooms unfurled on the frigid silver tree.<br>Yet this moment of betrayal did not go unwitnessed, for at that very moment, the [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon|heavenly moons]] peered down through the cloak of clouds, a longing still more audacious arising within them...
