==Description==
{{Description|A plant that grows in environments rich with Hydro. This plant can be found everywhere in Fontaine after its long rainy seasons. The plant is named "Pluie" &mdash; which means "rain" in the local tongue &mdash; for that reason.<br>The plant's growth can be influenced by abnormal Hydro density in its surroundings. It is said that ancient Fontainian natural philosophers would perform divination based on Pluie Lotuses' growth, predicting living souls' destinies and futures. The method they employed, however, was lost to time.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* As the description states, {{Fr|pluie}} is French for "rain."
* The design of the Pluie Lotus is likely inspired by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontederia_crassipes pontederia crassipes], an aquatic floating plant whose individual flowers have the same distinct purple-orange pattern found on the Pluie Lotus.
