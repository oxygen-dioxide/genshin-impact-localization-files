The '''Hiiragi Clan'''{{Lang|ja=柊家|ja_rm=Hiiragi-ke}} is a clan that serves [[Ei]]. They are the head of the [[Kanjou Commission]]. Their estate is situated on the [[Ritou]] peninsula of [[Narukami Island]].

It is uncertain when the clan was established, but it has been around for at least 500 years. 500 years ago,<ref group="Note">While this is not explicitly stated, it can be deduced based on other stories that take place during that time. According to [[Emblem of Severed Fate#Ornate Kabuto|Ornate Kabuto's description]], Ritou had been established by the time Hiroshi trained under [[Iwakura Michihiro]], which was over 13 years after the [[cataclysm]]. Hiroshi also claims that Doukei could take on [[Ako Domeki]], who is mentioned to have lived 500 years ago in [[Pirate's Diary]].</ref> [[Hiiragi Hiroshi]] established the settlement in Ritou and impressed Baal.<ref>{{Ref/VP|Ritou, Narukami Island}}</ref>
