==Profile==
{{Quote|One might say she pays too much attention or dotes on people too much... But while her actions can be flawed, I believe her sense of responsibility as Sumeru's deity to be a commendable thing. Ah, that the youngest of gods should be thus, while a certain other person, by contrast, should be so prone to hysterics...|Chief Justice Neuvillette of Fontaine|[https://www.hoyolab.com/article/9343828 The panacea brings purity, and from the palace depths is spring renewed]}}
Neuvillette has only been mentioned through their quote in [[Nahida]]'s official introduction. Although the quote gives little information on Neuvillette, it indicates that they are aware of Nahida's active intervention in [[Sumeru]]'s affairs, which is something unknown to Sumeru's general populace and is relegated to rumors. Neuvillette also regards Nahida's actions favorably compared to another god &mdash; possibly the current [[God of Justice]] &mdash; whom they characterize as "prone to hysterics."

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The French word and name ''Neuvillette'' can be deconstructed into three parts: ''neu-'', derived from ''neuf'' or ''neuve'' which means "new;" ''-ville-'', which means city or town; and ''-ette'', a suffix used with grammatically feminine words to indicate diminution or endearment.
** When used as a surname, Neuville is historically often paired with the {{w|Nobiliary particle#France|nobiliary particle}} ''de'' placed between the first name and surname, indicating a family's city of origin or dominion.
* The name Neuvillette may be a reference to Christian de Neuvillette, the deuteragonist of {{w|Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|''Cyrano de Bergerac''}}, who himself is loosely based on the real-life Christophe de Champagne, baron de Neuvillette. In the play, Christian is a fair-faced man but lacks eloquence and wit; with the help of the play's main character, Cyrano, he wins the heart of Cyrano's distant cousin Roxane, but later dies during the {{w|Siege of Arras (1640)|Siege of Arras}}. Nothing is known about the real-life Christophe besides his death during the Siege of Arras and his marriage to Madeleine Robineau, Baronne de Neuvillette.
* There are three French villages named {{w|Neuvillette}}.
