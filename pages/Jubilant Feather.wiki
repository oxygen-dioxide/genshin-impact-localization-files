{{Description|Like a mystical gem crystallized from peals of joyous laughter, it appears as two pages intertwined, or perhaps a feather flying freely. After being touched, "Excerpts of Bliss" can be retrieved from it...<br>It seems that their locations can be quickly ascertained using Jocund or Joyous Letters...|[[Map]] description}}
'''Jubilant Feathers''' are items found during the [[Summertide Scales and Tales]] event around the [[Simulanka]] map. When the player comes into contact with one, it will grant them {{Item|Excerpts of Bliss|x=3}}.

When a Jubilant Feather is within close proximity of a player, an icon {{Icon|Jubilant Feather}} will appear on the [[Minimap]] along with a sound effect, similar to an [[Oculus]]. They are marked with the icon on the [[Map]] after using the [[Jocund Letters]] or [[Joyous Letters]] Gadgets.
