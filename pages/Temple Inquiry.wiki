;(Talk to Aberaku)
:'''Paimon:''' Here comes one of those spirits...
:'''Aberaku:''' My name is...
:'''Aberaku:''' Aberaku, Helios-Forger!
:'''Aberaku:''' How could I have been felled by your vile slander, or imprisoned by your puppet infants!?
:'''Aberaku:''' I&mdash; No, wait. I was imprisoned for months and years beyond count, was I not? Then... This must be my post-life form?
:'''Paimon:''' "Post-life form"? You mean that you're already dead, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Takes a pretty rare spirit to realize that.
:'''Aberaku:''' And yet, though it shames me to say so, I know not just how I died...
:'''Aberaku:''' But I recall that I was imprisoned on orders from a child.
:'''Paimon:''' A child?
:'''Aberaku:''' Indeed. But till today, I can never feel any hatred for that child, only pity.
:'''Aberaku:''' He was not at fault. The blame should fall upon those who controlled him like a puppet in their palms... Forget it. Such things are best left unsaid.
:'''Aberaku:''' After that, I was imprisoned...
:'''Aberaku:''' Imprisoned in a...
:'''Paimon:''' In a...?
:'''Aberaku:''' In a very high place.
:'''Aberaku:''' But though it was high up, it was dark, lightless, and cold as the ice itself.
:'''Aberaku:''' ...Strange. Why is that?
:'''Aberaku:''' Why do I feel that a high place should have brought a person warmth and comfort?
:'''Aberaku:''' Why... Why can't I remember any of this?
:'''Paimon:''' Are you hungry, maybe?
:'''Paimon:''' Whenever Paimon's famished, forget thinking, she can barely even talk straight!
:{{DIcon}} I don't think that's his issue...
::'''Paimon:''' Come on, it's gotta be! Look at him, he can hardly speak clearly!
:{{DIcon}} Well, it just so happens that we have some emergen&mdash;
::'''Paimon:''' Hey!
:'''Paimon:''' Actually, {{Traveler}}, could you check if there's something to eat amongst the offerings?
:'''Aberaku:''' Wait! That's it! The offerings!
:'''Paimon:''' What, do you wanna eat them?
:'''Aberaku:''' No, I just remembered...
:'''Aberaku:''' When I died in prison, my attire and body were enshrined in various places due to my contribution in creating the Helios.
:'''Aberaku:''' But that also caused my spirit to be separated and rendered unable to rest.
:'''Aberaku:''' This place should have been the resting place of my sacred crown, though it has surely decayed by now. This must surely be why my thoughts are so... stuck.
:'''Aberaku:''' If this persists, I doubt that even my current state can be sustained for long...
:'''Aberaku:''' But these offerings can be used to replace the remnants of my body and my attire in sustaining an ounce of my thoughts.
:'''Aberaku:''' As such, please take them with you.
:'''Aberaku:''' However, there are many perils on the enshrining path. So though it may seem rude of me, could you accept a certain test first?
:'''Paimon:''' Test? What test?
:'''Aberaku:''' Please defeat the monsters hereabouts, the prison wardens of my spirit.
:'''Aberaku:''' This matter is perilous. Tell me once you are ready, O Traveler, and we shall begin.

;(Talk to Aberaku)
:'''Aberaku:''' Are you fully girded up, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready
::'''Aberaku:''' Then I wish you... every success in your battle ahead.
:;Start trial
:{{DIcon}} I need a while more to prepare.
::'''Aberaku:''' Then I shall await your tidings.

;(Talk to Aberaku after completing the trial)
:'''Aberaku:''' Ah, if only Byakuyakoku had such valiant warriors as you! Then...
:'''Aberaku:''' *sigh* If this thing is done, then my wishes shall be fulfilled.
:'''Aberaku:''' You must bring these offerings bearing my thoughts to be enshrined... in the place where I was held under arrest. We must do this, in order to...
:'''Paimon:''' In order to what?
:'''Aberaku:''' In order to... In order to...
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, there's no use talking to this guy now. Seems like his spirit's all messed up again.
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, let's just take those items with us.
:'''Paimon:''' But where was this high-up place where this guy was imprisoned?
