{{Description|Sumpter Beasts are friends of humanity. Gentle by nature they serve as important tools of production and transport. Sumpter Beasts can adapt to various different natural environment. Long before the forest merchants ever noticed them, these hardworking animals were already the much-relied-upon domesticated beasts of the desert peoples|[[Archive]]}}
'''Desert Sumpter Beast''' is a [[Wildlife]].

Much like [[Shaggy Sumpter Beast]]s, they spend their time wandering around the desert digging for meal. When resting, they will lie down on one side or burrow themselves in the sand. Unless they are not owned by an enemy faction, they will launch an attack to drive away approaching enemies.
