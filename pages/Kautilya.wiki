==Profile==
Kautilya is an [[Amurta]] researcher who was interested in [[Fungus|Fungi]], entering an agreement with [[Elchingen]] to host the [[Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament]]. The tournament was actually a guise as he had discovered the "Capturing Device" and "Withering Potion", which were failed attempts to control dangerous monsters. He began to work on the experiment himself, modifying them into the [[Wisdom Orb]] and Floral Jelly. At the end of the tournament, he is arrested by the [[Matra]] for academic misconduct.

===Personality===
According to [[Najah]], Kautilya is extremely arrogant and rude towards his students; he treats them as expendable servants to do his chores and ignores the papers that his students give him, making excuses that he has no time or disapproves of them.

===Appearance===
