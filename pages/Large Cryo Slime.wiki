{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Cryo Shield
|desc_1 = The Cryo Slime can generate a Cryo [[Shields|shield]] to protect them from all incoming DMG. The shield is weakest to {{Pyro}}.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Cryo|8}}
|strat_1 = The Cryo armor has 8 gauge units. 4 units of {{Pyro}}, 8 units of {{Electro}}, or 16 units of {{Anemo}}/{{Geo}} are required to destroy its shield. The Cryo armor also takes additional damage from [[Blunt Attack]]s.

|name_2 = Ice Shards
|desc_2 = Launches 3 ice shards at the player, each dealing '''33.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}. This attack is only used while the '''Cryo Shield''' is intact.

|name_3 = Leap
|desc_3 = Jumps high into the air before slamming down at the player's location, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}. This attack is only used while the '''Cryo Shield''' is intact.
* Certain enhanced Large Cryo Slimes, found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], and overworld events and challenges, have reduced [[Cooldown]] on this attack.

|name_4 = Regeneration
|desc_4 = If the '''Cryo Shield''' is destroyed, retreats and forms an ice mist that deals '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DoT}}. After the mist cloud is created, it will retreat into the middle of the cloud, waiting for its shield to regenerate.

|name_5 = Drowning Immunity
|desc_5 = The Large Cryo Slime constantly [[Frozen|freezes]] surfaces of water below them, making them unable to drown.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A monster created through the coagulation of Cryo in the natural environment.<br />These slimes can use the abundant Cryo energies within themselves to freeze the moisture in the atmosphere and form a protective shell around themselves. They can also utilize a similar principle to freeze the water around them. On some level, this can be considered to be the freest species of slime, as it can cross oceans and seas with ease.|[[Archive]]}}

==Notes==
*Cryo slimes are immune to [[Frozen]], but they can be wet. This may occur from contact with Hydro slimes, Hydro-based attacks, and [[rain]]. When attacked with [[Anemo]] they will swirl [[Hydro]] (in preference) initially until that status is dispelled, after which they then swirl with Cryo. The wet status only is briefly indicated together with Anemo on a Swirl.
**Even without a shield a Large Cryo Slimes remains immune to frozen.
**When raining it may be possible to very briefly inflict frozen on shieldless slimes.
