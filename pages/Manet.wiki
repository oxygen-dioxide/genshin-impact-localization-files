:'''Estella:''' The hearth in your home has been burning brightly lately, I see.
:'''Olivier:''' And the balances in yours have been working hard, haven't they?
:'''Manet:''' My hearth is strong, and the firewood, sufficient. As for the balances, I don't need 'em. It's not like I'll miss those one or two pieces of vegetables at the market, anyway.
:'''Estella:''' ...
:'''Estella:''' You'd best be careful. If the flames leap onto the opera house carpet, they'll put your hearth out while fighting the fires.
:'''Olivier:''' Ooh, very scary. But can you guarantee that the opera house would survive said flames?
:'''Manet:''' Nah, the fire in my house won't reach the opera house. It's way too far away!
:'''Olivier:''' ...
:'''Estella:''' ...So, have those flames been staying put?
:'''Olivier:''' Hmph. Why don't you guess?
:'''Estella:''' I'm not doing that. Just tell me.
:'''Manet:''' I bet they're behaving themselves instead. Where can they go, anyway?
:'''Olivier:''' ...
:'''Estella:''' ...
