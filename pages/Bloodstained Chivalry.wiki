'''Bloodstained Chivalry''' is an [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities which can be obtained from [[Clear Pool and Mountain Cavern]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* A 4{{star}} Bloodstained Chevalier's Goblet can be obtained from one of Sister [[Victoria]]'s dialogue branches in the Mondstadt Cathedral.
* 4-Piece Bonus:
** Is not lost when the character is switched out.
** Can be triggered upon defeating [[wildlife]].
** Even while active, Charged Attacks still require the minimum amount of stamina to be performed.
** Stamina regeneration will continue even while performing Charged Attacks provided the buff is active.
** If a Co-Op or off-field teammate kills the enemy, the 4-Piece Bonus will not take effect.<ref name=KQM>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/equipment/artifacts#bloodstained-chivalry Bloodstained Chivalry]</ref>
** If the character equipped with this set isn't the active character when an enemy dies through one of their skills, the 4-Piece Bonus will also not take effect.<ref name=KQM />
