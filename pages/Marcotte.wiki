==Description==
{{Description|A pink flower with a pearl-like luster and rich scent profile. It is one of the major perfume ingredients.<br>Marcotte is said to represent purity and sincere care.<br>In Fontaine, the first thing a perfumer learns is to extract fragrant substances from Marcotte. On top of that, the plant's honey can be used for making jam and mulled wine, making it an indispensable part of everyday life in Fontaine.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* {{Fr|Marcotte}} is a French word used in horticulture to describe a plant propagated through the process of {{Fr|marcottage|{{w|layering}}.}}
** Unlike propagation via {{w|Cutting (plant)|cutting}}, the new plant is only separated after the production of new roots. This technique is mostly applied to {{w|woody plant}}s.
