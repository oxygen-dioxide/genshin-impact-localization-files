==Dialogue==
===Brokeboat Mountain===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with Scene Notes for "Brokeboat Mountain")
:'''Scene Notes:''' This is a cut scene of the show "Brokeboat Mountain"
:'''Scene Notes:''' Originally, the story showed two Hydro Eidolons on board a broken boat, floating along, who fall deeply in love.
:'''Scene Notes:''' After confessing their feelings for one another, they stand upon the prow of the boat illuminated by the afterglow of the sunset. The scene is extremely romantic.
:'''Scene Notes:''' However, this scene was abandoned because... the two Hydro Eidolons acting the part were simply too energetic and couldn't stop moving for the big romantic scene.
:'''Scene Notes:''' If only I could catch {{Color|buzzword|two of them on the prow of the boat at the same time}}, the scene would be perfect...
:'''Scene Notes:''' &mdash; [[Zosimos|The Director]]
{{Dialogue End}}

===Journey to the East===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with Scene Notes for "Journey to the East")
:'''Scene Notes:''' This is a cut scene from the show "Journey to the East"
:'''Scene Notes:''' The original idea revolved around a tale of a traveler and their journey eastwards from [[Fontaine]] to [[Sumeru City]] to search for unassuming wisdom in the [[House of Daena]].
:'''Scene Notes:''' This scene concerned how the traveler saved the "Master of Earthly Transformations" from being crushed by a massive boulder, and their adventures on the road.
:'''Scene Notes:''' Unfortunately, the Hydro Eidolons acting the part of both the traveler as well as the Master of Earthly Transformations have disappeared.
:'''Scene Notes:''' If only someone could {{Color|buzzword|bring them both back}}, and capture the rehearsal by the huge boulder...
{{Dialogue End}}

===The Great Escape===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with Scene Notes for "The Great Escape")
:'''Scene Notes:''' This is a cut scene from the show "The Great Escape"
:'''Scene Notes:''' The original story was about a Hydro Eidolon trapped in a mysterious cave, who could only use the tools hidden within a tome to escape to freedom...
:'''Scene Notes:''' But [[Idyia]] outright rejected the idea.
:'''Scene Notes:''' She had a point, Hydro Eidolons wouldn't need tools to escape a cave, they could just leave whenever they wanted. Also, hiding tools in a book was a bit contrived.
:'''Scene Notes:''' But... this is definitely a blockbuster idea! If only Idyia could see just how brilliant it is...
:'''Scene Notes:''' But, alas, first the {{color|buzzword|tome containing the tools stolen by hilichurls}} must be retrieved...
:'''Scene Notes:''' &mdash; The Director

;(After approaching the two newly spawned hilichurls)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah. That noticeboard did say that the hilichurls stole the prop book in the abandoned studio!
:'''Paimon:''' That wouldn't be this hilichurl here, would it...?

;(After the battle)
:;(Obtain [["The Great Escape" Prop Book]])
{{Dialogue End}}
