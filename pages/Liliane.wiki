==Profile==
Liliane is a thief from Mondstadt who eventually came to Fontaine. She was first spotted stealing from [[Lectoure]] in the [[Romaritime Harbor]] by [[Lyney]] during {{Quest|Soloist's Prologue}}. She was pursued by Lyney alongside [[Lynette]], the [[Traveler]], and [[Paimon]], but was able to escape, albeit without the stolen items.

She would later be seen as an audience member in Lyney's magic show at the [[Opera Epiclese (Instance)|Opera Epiclese]] during {{Quest|The City of Rains and Remembrance}}. She had intended to go to the show in order to destress, but after learning that the show had been sold out, she stole a ticket to get in. She would use the alias '''Halsey''', a famous Fontaine artist, in the registration.

During the show, she was selected by Lyney's random number generator to participate in a special trick. However, unbeknownst to her or Lyney, she was targeted by [[Marcel (Fontaine)|Marcel]] as part of kidnappings and experiments involving young Fontainian women to bring back his love [[Vigneire]], by exposing them to water from the [[Primordial Sea]] and attempting to reverse the transformation. Marcel had tasked [[Cowell]] with acquiring the subject, who rigged the random number generator to always select Liliane's seat. Cowell proceeded to place a balloon with Primordial Seawater inside the magic box, which would pop when the magic box descended into the tunnel and a metal hook pierced it, therefore dousing the victim with the water. Cowell then sabotaged the rope holding up the water tank to make sure that once the victim dissolved and the magic box reached the stage after being transported through the tunnel, the rope would quickly burn and the water tank would fall and spill water onto the stage, thereby obscuring any evidence of the Primordial Seawater used to commit the crime. However, as she hailed from Mondstadt and the water only worked on people from Fontaine, it had no effect on her and she instead found herself suddenly drenched, causing her to panic and force her way out of the box that the rest of the audience heard as a loud thud, and into the tunnel under the stage. Cowell, who believed that the seawater needed time to take effect, tried to subdue her, but Liliane overpowered him, smashing him with a vase. She then put his body back in the box, unaware of the sabotaged rope and water tank and changed her clothes, hiding in a box of costumes stored in the tunnel.

The act resulted in Cowell being killed, crushed by the sabotaged water tank. Lyney was initially accused by [[Furina]] of causing Halsey's disappearance and killing Cowell, which resulted in him and Lynette becoming defendants in a trial. As [[Neuvillette]] ordered the opera house to be locked down, Liliane was unable to leave and became hungry, stealing some macarons that [[Navia]] had made for herself, the Traveler and Paimon. The Traveler defended Lyney in court, but all seemed to be lost when [[Vaughn]], another associate of Marcel's, revealed Lyney had Primordial Water stored in his belongings. Navia then realized that something was off and discovered Liliane outside the court, correctly identifying her as the suspect that had stolen her macarons, convincing her to testify on Lyney's behalf in return for a reduced sentence. Liliane agreed and returned to the courtroom with the same magic trick Lyney had used, confessing to theft and how Cowell had ended up in the box. She revealed that she had hidden because she feared that she would be sent to the [[Fortress of Meropide]], believing that Lyney was onto her after their encounter at Romaritime Harbor.

Her testimony resulted in Lyney being absolved of the charges placed against him. While Neuvillette stated that her actions would warrant additional investigation, presumably for her thievery, she was cleared in the matter of Cowell's death.
