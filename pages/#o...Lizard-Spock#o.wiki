==Trivia==
* The description of the achievement calls it the "rock-paper-scissors" attack, but the hypostasis actually does it in the order of rock, scissors, paper.
* The achievement's name is a reference to Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard, an expanded version of Rock Paper Scissors invented by internet pioneer {{w|Sam Kass}} and Karen Bryla.<ref>Sam Kass: [http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard]</ref><!--
