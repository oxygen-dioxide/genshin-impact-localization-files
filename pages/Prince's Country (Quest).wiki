;(Approach Freminet and Zuria Destree)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Is your child feeling any better?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 zuria-destree 01.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Thank you for your concern, Freminet. His condition is fairly stable. The family doctor said we might be able to take him out for a stroll today.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zuria! Freminet! We're here.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 zuria-destree 02.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Hehe, seems like everyone's arrived now.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not quite, aren't we missing someone? But Paimon has a guess where he might be!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Thelxieeee!
:;(Thelxie waddles out of the tent, armed with a colorful sword and shield.)

:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Thelxie's got himself a sword and a shield now! He's lookin' sharp.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 zuria-destree 03.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Indeed, with his weapons in hand, Thelxie looks more formidable than ever. You've really outdone yourself, Freminet.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We helped, too!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yes, you really had a good eye for materials. Everything you found was high quality.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Speaking of which, Zuria just told me that she wants to end the adventure with a coronation ceremony. So, could I also trouble you with finding some materials for the crown?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' You can just keep an eye out for them on our way to the ruins. I was planning to collect the materials myself, but then I realized you might be able to find some prettier ones than what I could get my hands on.
:{{DIcon}} Consider it done.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like everything's ready to go. Shall we head out?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 zuria-destree 04.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Please wait a moment. I was just thinking... Since Thelxie has already shown us his brand-new appearance, we may already be able to draw a new page in the picture book. What do you think?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Paimon's excited now!
:{{DIcon}} What should we draw on the page?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Hmm, why don't we use the story we know as a reference? Just make the atmosphere a bit less grim...
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we'll take out the sad parts and replace them with happier stuff? Sounds great to Paimon.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 zuria-destree 05.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Alright, I'll give it a try. I'm not very adept at drawing, but I've seen a lot of art during my work. Now, as for the actual content of the drawing... please tell me what you'd like to see.
:[[File:Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures Picture Book 1 Part 1.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Let me think... We can draw the weapon. The prince has picked up the sword of courage and the shield of perseverance, which proves he has crossed the mire of doubt, and is now ready to wage war against the darkness.
:[[File:Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures Picture Book 1 Part 2.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 zuria-destree 06.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Okay, I'll add the weapon... Anything else?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to give him some friends! Thelxie's got some friends by his side now, so he's no longer fighting alone.

;(Approach the collection area)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, those are materials that we can use for the crown, right? Let's get some for Freminet.

;(Interact with Inscribed Shell (II), optional)
:'''Inscribed Shell (II):''' Those are pearls that were his eyes; nothing of his bones that do fade.

;(Collect 3 {{Item|Material for Thelxie's Crown}})
:{{A|vo rpeq002 3 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' These should be enough... I knew you'd have a knack for finding the best materials. We shouldn't need anything else to head to the Kingdom of Water Imps.

;(Approach the domain entrance)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Is that the entrance to the underwater ruins ahead?
----
;(Enter the domain)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So these are the underwater ruins that Freminet found... They're pretty amazing, but still not exactly the kind that Paimon was imagining...
:{{DIcon}} This is the Kingdom of Water Imps, Paimon, not ruins...
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, Paimon knows, it's just... Paimon thought we'd actually see a fairytale world, like with the Water Imps' colorful houses, and the rainbow bridge...
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I'm sorry... I was hoping to put up some decorations but ran out of time to do it by myself.
:{{DIcon}} It's okay, it's fantasy time now!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Someone's already switched into fantasy mode!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 zuria-destree 01.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Seems like {{Traveler}}'s already got the gist of things. You should do your best too, Paimon.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, don't underestimate Paimon! Paimon can flip the switch, too. Now entering... Paimon Fantasy Mode!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahem... Young adventurers! 'Tis Paimon, Guardian Goddess of this land. State your goals and intentions for visiting this nation!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 zuria-destree 02.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' We are the companions of Prince Thelxie, Your Divine Highness. We have come to help him reclaim the glory that he has lost.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Reclaiming your glory! Thy goddess here has golden glory, silver glory, and bronze glory. Which is it that the prince has lost?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 zuria-destree 03.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Uhh...
:{{DIcon}} Did you break character, Paimon?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not at all! This is the goddess's test! From your responses, the goddess has concluded that you're all brave adventurers without the taint of greed in your hearts! As such, you are worthy of everyone's respect!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, please accept the goddess's reward. The goddess will now bestow all three types of glory upon you!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And as for this prince... the goddess will also bestow upon you the rainbow glory, so your future will always be filled with light!

:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 zuria-destree 04.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' My gratitude to Your Divine Highness for such generous blessings. Power is now surging through every part of my body.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Me... Me too... Is this the divine inspiration of legend?
:{{DIcon}} All thanks to the power of Goddess Paimon!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe! Ahem... now adventurers, forge bravely ahead and defeat the monsters that have taken over the kingdom! You will be sure to find that which you seek!

;(During combat)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Please be careful, brave adventurers! Just ahead are some evil enemies that have invaded the Kingdom of Water Imps! They are called... uhh... Hilichurls of the Deep!
:'''Thelxie:''' -.. -... .-- -...!?<ref group="Note" name="Ça va"/>

;(After defeating the second wave)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 5 zuria-destree 01.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Those accursed enemies are back again... Your Highness, please show them what you're made of!

;(After defeating the fourth wave)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 5 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' We're under attack again! It's a Lawachurl of the Deep!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 5 zuria-destree 02.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' There's no need to fear, my friends! His Highness is so strong now that even a Divinichurl of the Deep would pose no threat to him!

;(After defeating the opponents)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, it's finally over! So, have we defeated the evil monsters and reclaimed the Kingdom of Water Imps?
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 zuria-destree 01.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Yes, it should now be time for us to attend Thelxie's coronation ceremony... The only thing is, I didn't expect this to go so smoothly. I thought it would have taken longer for us to reach the heart of the ruins...
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 zuria-destree 02.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' It was my mistake. I should have told Freminet earlier that we would also need a crown...
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's all because {{Traveler}} and Goddess Paimon were too strong! We just eradicated all the monsters in one go.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' It's okay, Zuria. We can come back again once I've made the crown.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 zuria-destree 03.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Then I must thank all of you again for taking the time. And you too, Thelxie, my child.

:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thelxie's turning out to be a real expert at fighting!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I don't think there's anything that will be able to stop him... He's like a true prince now.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 zuria-destree 04.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Yes, I agree as well!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Let's head back to camp for now. I asked {{Traveler}} to search for some materials on the way because I want to make the crown as soon as possible.
:{{A|vo rpeq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can add an update to Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures as well! Now that we've reclaimed the Kingdom of Water Imps, it's time for us to draw some new scenes in the picture book.
:;(The player is teleported back to the camp)
----
;(Return to the camp)
:{{A|vo rpeq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zuria and Freminet, why don't we draw the new pages first? Paimon really wants to update the picture book!
:{{DIcon}} You just want to see someone draw Godddess Paimon...
:{{A|vo rpeq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! You didn't have to say it out loud!
:{{A|vo rpeq002 7 zuria-destree 01.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Haha, no problem, I'm happy to oblige. Then in that case, the story today should go something like this...
