==Description==
In a time no one remembers, the night before the sandstorm of tragedy swept through [[Ay-Khanoum|paradise]]...<br>
The flowers and the trees once spoke of the mortal realms, their hopes, and their desolate future.<br>
The ones who must not be approached brought about the [[Forbidden Knowledge|gray death]], and the dark tide ravaged the raw river banks,<br>
Only for the newborn plants and beasts to unite with mortals and push the rolling sinister waves back.

In the lonesome years after she had broken off ties with the [[King Deshret|lord of the red sands]], the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|queen of grass and trees]] forged [[Khvarena]] into a [[Simurgh|divine bird]],<br>
Charging her with the protection of two worlds, with the guardianship of the border between new birth and death.<br>
The divine bird lived amongst the pines, the cypresses and the snow-lotuses, and slumbered in dreams that recalled a time when the covenant still endured...<br>
It was only when disaster came that she awakened, and went to her inevitable doom.<br>
Later, just as [[Nabu Malikata|that person]] had prophesied sadly, the deathly, silent gloom would permeate the rainforest...<br>
Just as that covenant fellow had warned, the [[Cataclysm|tides of dark beasts]] swarmed forth and swept through the newly birthed forests...

The [[Egeria|former leader]] of the [[Fontaine|realm of water]] was slain amidst the upheaval, and her body was transformed into a sea of pure dew, the Amrita,<br>
And yet even that pure sea would dry up in a desolate land destroyed by the [[Abyss]].<br>
Yet the mistress of grass and trees had no time to mourn, for the [[Harvisptokhm|mother-tree of numberless seeds]] needed to be nurtured...<br>
To cleanse the dark impurities and ensure the purity of the Amrita, Simurgh would shatter its divine form—

"All beautiful things born from the Khvarena of flowers must face their fate — to wither and fall into the mud,"<br>
"And once they have withered, they shall be reborn, nourished by the Amrita, as beings of the flowery sea, no longer troubled by such things as 'death.'"

==Trivia==
*In the original Chinese text, the "realm of water" is {{Zh|水之国|tl=kingdom of water (Hydro)}}. It is likely that the former leader spoken about is the previous Hydro [[Archon]].
