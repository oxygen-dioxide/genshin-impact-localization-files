'''Adventure Encounters''' is a [[Game System]] that provides an alternative way to collect [[Commission]] [[Commission#Rewards|Rewards]] through the usage of '''Encounter Points'''.

It is unlocked upon reaching [[Adventure Rank]] 24.

==Overview==
{{Stub|If your AR increases and you enter a new Commission Reward bracket, do your Commission Rewards from Encounter Point redemption immediately increase, or are they still the amount corresponding to your bracket at reset like for normal Commissions?}}
Adventure Encounters can be found on the bottom of the [[Adventurer Handbook#Commissions|Adventurer Handbook "Commissions"]] page, under the heading "Encounter Points Stage Rewards." Encounter Points can be earned through various means and can be used to claim Commission Rewards.

==Usage==
Encounter Points can be used to claim [[Commission#Rewards|commission rewards]]. The standard range of commission rewards will always be offered (instead of the reduced rewards found in many NPC commissions).

A maximum of 4 commission rewards can be obtained each day, regardless of the method used to obtain them: 
* by either completing [[Commission|Daily Commissions]]; or 
* using Encounter Points; or 
* a combination of both.

Upon receiving all 4 commission rewards for the day, all incomplete Daily Commissions will no longer offer commission rewards, but they can still be completed to obtain commission-specific rewards, such as [[Achievement]]s. 

Although fractions of an Encounter Point may be obtained (see [[#Obtaining Encounter Points|Obtaining Encounter Points]]), only whole Encounter Points can be used. These appear as orange-red gift icons in a complete, purple ring. When redeeming Encounter Points, the player will receive the maximum number of commission rewards that can be awarded based on how many whole Encounter Points they have, up to the daily limit. There is no option to redeem a smaller number of commission rewards than what the player can currently obtain with their Encounter Points.

==Storage==
A maximum of 4 Encounter Points can be stored at a time. This limit '''decreases''' by 1 for every Daily Commission completed. Upon reaching the storage limit, any Encounter Points obtained thereafter will be stored as [[#Long-Term Encounter Points|Long-Term Encounter Points]].

Once all 4 commission rewards for the day are claimed, any unused Encounter Points will become unavailable. For instance, this may occur if the player obtains Encounter Points, does not use the Encounter Points, and proceeds to complete the 4 Daily Commissions. The unused Encounter Points in this case will be lost and will '''not''' be converted into Long-Term Encounter Points. 

Encounter Points are reset at each [[Reset|Daily Reset]].

===Long-Term Encounter Points===
Encounter Points obtained after reaching the daily limit will be converted into and stored as Long-Term Encounter Points. Long-Term Encounter Points are not reset at Daily reset and are instead reset every [[Version]] ending with x.0.

Every 30 {{Item|Original Resin}} used while not in possession of maximum Encounter Points will convert one Long-Term Encounter Point into an Encounter Point.

==Obtaining Encounter Points==
* '''4''' Encounter Points for:
** Completing an [[Archon Quest]]
** Completing a [[Story Quest]], including most Event Story Quests
*** Shorter Event Story Quests, such as ''[[The Two Musketeers' Triumph (Quest)|The Two Musketeers' Triumph]]'', may award less than 4 points.
* '''1''' Encounter Point for:
** Opening the [[Luxurious Chest]] found in a [[Shrine of Depths]]
* '''0.5''' Encounter Points for:
** Opening a [[chest]], except for those found in [[Shrines of Depths]]
*** Chests that are specially featured as part of a [[Domain]], [[Quest]], or [[Hidden Exploration Objective]], as well as [[Takashi]]'s Common Chests, do not award Encounter Points.
*** [[Mora Chest]]s do not award Encounter Points, as they are not actually chests.
** Collecting certain [[item]]s, including:
*** [[Oculi]]
*** [[Crimson Agate]]s
*** [[Lumenspar]]
*** [[Plumes of Purifying Light]]
*** [[Spirit Carp]]
* Varying amounts for:
** Claiming rewards from in-game [[Event]]s, with the total rewards for a single stage of an activity<!-- e.g. claiming all 3 tiers for one "day" of a small event, or likewise for one mini-event in a flagship event --> typically awarding '''2 - 3.5'''{{Verify|likely outdated}}<!-- could use some refining --> Encounter Points
*** [[Chest]]s that are part of Events, such as [[Lost Riches]], can award Encounter Points, with the amount determined by the event instead of being the standard 0.5 Encounter Points.
*** [[Test Run - Character Trial Event]] does not award Encounter Points.
*** Encounter Points are not awarded when acquiring rewards granted through other mechanisms, including:
**** Bonus rewards from [[Ley Line Overflow]] and [[Overflowing Mastery]]
**** [[Marvelous Merchandise]]
** Completing a [[World Quest]], excluding Event World Quests
*** [[Random World Quest]]s and [[Requests|Reputation Requests]] do not award Encounter points.
** Completing a [[Hangout Event]] Quest (also known as an Invitation Quest) for the first time
*** The additional rewards for unlocking a certain amount of Hangout Memories do not award Encounter Points.
