'''Hanbei''' was the [[Tenryou Commission]] officer in charge of the maintenance of the [[Mikage Furnace]] when the [[Traveler]] first arrived in [[Inazuma]]. He is mentioned several times throughout the [[World Quest]] series ''[[Tatara Tales]]'', during which his absence is openly criticized by those handling the situation in his stead.

Following the events of the quest series, Hanbei has been relocated from his former position, all but demoted due to his mishandling of the situation.

==Profile==
During the events of ''Tatara Tales'', Hanbei was not present in Mikage Furnace to solve the incident caused by the high saturation of [[Tatarigami]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales: Process Is Everything}}</ref> [[Miyuki]] and Xavier believe he went to [[Inazuma City]] to submit forms and report the incident to powerful individuals instead of taking decisive action himself.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales (Quest)}}</ref>

After [[Xavier]] and the [[Traveler]] finally resolve the situation on their own, [[Toranosuke]] informs them of Hanbei's fate: their superior, [[Mikoshi Genjirou]], came to Mikage Furnace to learn about the situation directly. He passed Toranosuke's report to his own superior, who then decided that Hanbei's "praiseworthy" work ethic earned him the illustrious job of being dispatched to [[Sumeru]] to oversee the [[mushroom]] trade.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales: The Last Act}}</ref>
