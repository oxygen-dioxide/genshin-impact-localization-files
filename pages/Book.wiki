There are numerous '''books''' found within ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that feature short stories or reveal history and lore about the world of [[Teyvat]].

Players can find books by exploring Teyvat. Some books are received from NPCs through dialogue or [[quest]] rewards. Others can be bought from [[Wanwen Bookhouse]] in [[Liyue]], the [[Yae Publishing House]] in [[Inazuma]], the [[Newsstand Board]] in [[Fontaine]], or [[Idukan's Trove]] in [[Natlan]]. When collected, the majority of books go straight into the Archive instead of appearing in the inventory.

Players can see the books they've collected by opening the [[Archive]] on the Paimon menu, and navigating to 'Books.' For the rest of the books not considered part of collections, they can be found under the Quest Items tab in the inventory.
