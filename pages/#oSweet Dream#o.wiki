'''"Sweet Dream"''' is a [[Special Dish]] that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Almond Tofu]] with [[Xiao]].

"Sweet Dream" increases all party members' ATK by '''114''' for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* To celebrate Xiao's playable release, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] released a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/13899 real-life recipe] for [[Almond Tofu]] and "Sweet Dream." In the blog post's story, Xiao doesn't actually make "Sweet Dream" &mdash; the [[Traveler]] prepared it as a gift to him, and the only difference from regular Almond Tofu is the choice of toppings.
