==Trivia==
*To celebrate Xiao's playable release, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] released a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/13899 real-life recipe] for [[Almond Tofu]] and "Sweet Dream." In the blog post's story, Xiao doesn't actually make "Sweet Dream" &mdash; the [[Traveler]] prepared it as a gift to him, and the only difference from regular Almond Tofu is the choice of toppings.
*The following birthday mails included "Sweet Dream":
**[[Birthday/Xiao#I got you some Crystalflies.|Xiao's 2021 Birthday Mail]] (1 "Sweet Dream")
**[[Birthday/Xiao#When You're Free...|Xiao's 2022 Birthday Mail]] (1 "Sweet Dream")
