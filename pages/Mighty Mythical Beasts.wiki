'''Mighty Mythical Beasts''' is a Wushou dance troupe based in Liyue. [[Gaming]] is its founder and current leader.

==Overview==
Gaming formally founded the Mighty Mythical Beasts soon after meeting his suanni companion [[Man Chai]].<ref>{{Ref/CS|Gaming}}</ref> His goal for the troupe is to popularize Wushou Dance in [[Liyue Harbor]]. Gaming works hard to promote the troupe however he can, including by busking and recommending them to his [[Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency (Faction)|transport agency]] clientele. The Mighty Mythical Beasts haven't yet seen much professional success, but their recent performance at Liyue's [[Lantern Rite]] was very well received.
