{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Abbanes:''' Something's not quite right recently... Looks like we need to get a couple more mercenaries.
:{{DIcon}} Is something up?
::'''Abbanes:''' Nothing serious, but something's not right either way.
::'''Abbanes:''' We have a ship in our caravan, right? I recently found out that [[Snezhnaya]]n imports to the [[Akademiya]] have increased by quite a lot.
::'''Abbanes:''' Many caravans were surprised by this turn of events, and many agreed upon plans were disrupted.
::'''Abbanes:''' Also, I feel that the pirates have been making bigger moves these days. There have also been sightings of Kairagi in the open sea!
::'''Abbanes:''' I don't want to run into any pirate attacks. We've got to think of something.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Abbanes:''' Bye. I'll have to think about hiring someone.
