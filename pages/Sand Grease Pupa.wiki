==Descriptions==
{{Description|In the legend of the desert folk, Quicksand Eels and Wenut are all descendants of the giant serpent that once devoured the sun. Although this statement is but groundless, judging from the research on Sand Grease Pupa, it does share many similarities with the body fat of Wenut given their respective composition. It is precisely because of this that sometimes cunning merchants will collect Sand Grease Pupae and grind them into powder to pass off as the high-end spices extracted from the body fat of Wenut.}}
