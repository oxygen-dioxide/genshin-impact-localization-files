:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... hot... If only there was some shade for us to cool off under...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we should take a break.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We still have a long way to go, so you'll need to hang in there for a while longer. This is not a good place to rest, anyway.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *pant* Okay... But don't you feel hot too, Cyno?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Of course, but I'm accustomed to these conditions.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Care to share any tips? Paimon's about to melt away...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Just try to stay focused &mdash; use your willpower to support your mind. The moment you start to give in is when you'll feel more tired.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Take one step after another. Don't let your mind perceive your body's limitations. We must get somewhere safe before we can relax.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh okay, if you say so. But where would be a more safe place to rest? Paimon thinks this is a perfectly safe place to stop.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just look around, it's just sand and desert. There aren't any monsters for miles around... Whoa! Where did these scorpions come from!?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 1 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Watch out, something's not right about them...
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|You are attacked by scorpions in the desert. Defeat them quickly!}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After defeating the scorpions)
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... Well, Paimon really didn't expect to see those here.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Those weren't just normal scorpions.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' See, there are marked numbers on their pincers. They were raised by someone.
:{{DIcon}} So, you mean...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Someone doesn't want us to show up at the auction. These scorpions were sent to keep us away.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We are surrounded by desert as far as the eye can see. If we were killed out here, nobody would ever know.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This place is super dangerous! Good thing we didn't let our guard down.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Something's not right... There are no roads in the desert, so how could they know where we are?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Stay still, (Traveler).
::[[File:Miniature Tracking Device.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Here's the answer... They must have planted this on you.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What is it?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' A miniature tracking device made by the [[Kshahrewar]]. They can use this to discern your approximate location.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But this device wasn't licensed for mass production. Where did they get it... Could someone from the Kshahrewar also be involved? Hmm, but that doesn't seem right...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 paimon 04a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo cnlq002 2 paimon 04b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Paimon never knew that kind of thing even existed! Why would it be on (Traveler)?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' They probably planted it on the Traveler during our fight with the mercenaries earlier.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry.
:{{DIcon}} I didn't even notice...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It was a frantic fight. It's only natural you didn't notice the device.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, good thing you were able to find it, Cyno! Now let's get rid of it!
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmm, no... Hold on to it for now. It might still be useful for us.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 2 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Let's keep heading to the auction. It would be dangerous to linger here any longer.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|The scorpions lying in ambush here have all been defeated. That said, there seem to be more and more forces involved...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo cnlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They're back again! How many of them are there!?

;(Approach the auction site)
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Weird... Is this where the auction is?
:{{DIcon}} There's nobody here.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, not a single soul... Maybe they're on break right now or something?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We didn't waste any time getting here after we defeated those mercenaries. They shouldn't have been able to give any warning of our arrival.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But even so, they still knew we were coming. Someone here must have been watching the tracker, and warned everyone to clear out.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, what should we do now?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We search the area. They couldn't have moved all the Knowledge Capsules so quickly. There might still be something left for us to find.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's take a good look around the area!

;(Investigate the Canned Knowledge on the mat)
:'''Investigate:'''(Ordinary Canned Knowledge, seems to have nothing to do with the Court of Desolation.)

;(Investigate the Canned Knowledge on the box)
:'''Investigate:''' (A large amount of Canned Knowledge has been piled here, enough to fetch an extremely large amount of Mora at market price.)

;(Investigate the footprints)
:'''Investigate:''' (The scattered footprints have not been completely buried by the wind and sand, but it is impossible to speculate on the direction of the merchants' escape from the footprints.)

;(Investigate the Sumpter Beast)
:'''Investigate:''' (The Sumpter Beast is drinking water leisurely and seems to be completely unaffected.)

;(After investigating the four spots)
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Did you find anything?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, nothing in particular...
:{{DIcon}} Only some average-looking Knowledge Capsules.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's possible there weren't many Knowledge Capsules containing info about the Court of Desolation, so they carried those off.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But don't worry, I have another idea. (Traveler), you two start heading back the way we came. I will remain hidden here.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Come back and meet me here after some time has passed. I'm sure something will come up by then.
:{{DIcon}} So that's why you wanted me to carry the tracking device...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' They packed up in a hurry and didn't have time to carry off all their goods. They won't just leave them here.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Once they think we've left the premises, they'll be back to pick up their belongings. We just need to make sure the tracker goes far enough from here to make them assume that it's safe to come back.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it! We'll lure them out because they'll think we've left!
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, we'll start heading away and leave this place to you.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 4 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes, and don't worry, if they dare to return, I'll make sure they stay.

;(Talk to Cyno again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq002 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There's no time to lose. Leave as soon as you're ready.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|The auction site is already empty, and Cyno decides to let you leave with the tracker to lure them back...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo cnlq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... So tired... We've probably gone far enough now, right?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, this is far enough.
::{{A|vo cnlq002 6 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Let's rest for a little while before we go back to find Cyno!
:{{DIcon}} We should go a little further.
::{{A|vo cnlq002 6 paimon 02b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Further? But Paimon can't go another step... How about we rest here for a while.

:'''You sit and rest for a while nearby.'''

:{{A|vo cnlq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, it's probably about time for us to head back to the auction.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go, maybe Cyno's finally found some leads.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|It is almost time. Go check if Cyno has got anything.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the auction site)
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Looks like Cyno caught someone!
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you're the bad guy behind all this, aren't ya? Alright, tell Paimon everything you know!
:{{DIcon}} Does he know anything about the smuggling?
:{{DIcon}} Does he have an important role in the auction?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I didn't act immediately when he showed up. Rather, I laid low and observed for a while instead.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' He is not the primary instigator, but he is most likely one of the more important dealers here. Am I right?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 bahari 01.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Yes, impressive... You certainly live up to your reputation, Cyno. If I had any idea you were still around, I wouldn't have gotten so greedy.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Greedy? What do you mean by that?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 bahari 02.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Once everyone knew you were coming, all the Canned Knowledge dealers abandoned their goods and fled at once. Obviously, there wasn't time to pack up everything.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 bahari 03.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Since all the goods were just left here unsupervised, I thought I'd use the opportunity to come back and take what I could. You know, free merchandise is good business, but... *sigh* I suppose there's no use explaining it now.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You must know who's manufacturing and selling the Canned Knowledge, correct? Will you tell us willingly, or do I need to make you talk?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 bahari 04.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' No, no, I'll talk. But before that, perhaps we can take the conversation elsewhere?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 bahari 05.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' If we stay here, chances are that someone will see me with you. That would put both me and my family in danger.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright. Where do you suggest we go?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 bahari 06.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' How about my home in Aaru Village? It should be safe there.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 7 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Fine, let's head out. You can throw away the tracker now, (Traveler).

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo cnlq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Listen buddy, you'd better not try to trick us!
:{{A|vo cnlq002 8 bahari 01.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' C'mon now, do you really think I'd try to pull anything under Cyno's watch? Seriously, what can I even do?
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|You caught a man who returned to the auction, and he invited you to Aaru Village to have a talk.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Bahari's house)
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 simin 01.ogg}} '''Simin:''' Dad, you're back!
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 simin 02.ogg}} '''Simin:''' Oh, we have guests? Uh, hi there...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 01.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' This is my daughter, Simin. She can be a little shy of strangers.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 02.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Why don't you run along now, dear? Dad needs to talk with our guests.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 simin 03.ogg}} '''Simin:''' Oh... okay.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 03.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Everyone knows Cyno in our business, but let me ask, who are you two?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon is Paimon, and this is (Traveler)!
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 04.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' To be honest, I really didn't expect to see Cyno the lone operator working with any partners. When I saw the tracker start moving away, I assumed you had decided to just go back empty-handed.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 05.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' But even though you caught me, I'd still urge you to stop while you still can. You should abandon this investigation.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Why's that?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 06.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Everything from the manufacturing of Canned Knowledge, to the sales and even splitting the profits... every step of the process involves dozens, if not hundreds of people. Massive profits have brought everyone together in this business.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 07.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Everyone will try their best to defend this industry that we've worked to build. It will be a long and difficult fight, even for you, Cyno.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 08.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' And even if you manage to win in the end, no one will thank you. If anything, you yourself might even feel remorse... Why are you so bent on putting us out of business?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Everyone has their own reasons for what they do. I don't have to explain mine.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 09.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 simin 04.ogg}} '''Simin:''' Here's some tea, Dad... and for the guests, too.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 10.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Ah, right. I forgot to offer tea to our guests. Thank you.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 simin 05.ogg}} '''Simin:''' Don't mention it... And, uh...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 simin 06.ogg}} '''Simin:''' I should tell you that our tea tastes kinda bitter, but I put some sugar in to make it a little tastier.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 11.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' That's my girl. Do we still have any sugar left? If not, I'll buy some more next time.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 simin 07.ogg}} '''Simin:''' Yes, we do... Okay, I'm gonna go have a rest now.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Didn't you say that everyone's in it for the massive profits? That sure doesn't seem to be the case for you.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 12.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Ahem, actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I was hoping to ask you for a favor.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 13.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' My daughter was born with a chronic disease, so she has a relatively weak heart and lungs. Even slightly strenuous exercise can cause her to faint and prove to be a life-threatening risk.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 14.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' That's why she's never really had any friends to play with, and why she locks herself up in her room most of the time. She has to take lots of medicine, and it doesn't come cheap.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 15.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' As for me, I was just an average merchant. I would wake up early and travel all around to make a profit, but the Mora was still nowhere near enough. I could only watch my daughter's health deteriorate day by day.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 16.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' Until one day, someone reached out and showed me a way to really make a profit...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Selling Canned Knowledge?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 17.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' That's right. With all the Mora I made, I could finally afford medical treatment for my daughter. Nothing made me happier than seeing her get better.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 18.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' There are many others like me. Smuggling Canned Knowledge might seem like an unforgivable crime to you, but to us, it's a means of survival.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 19.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' I wanted to tell you all this so that maybe you could understand and change your mind. Please stay out of this, Cyno. Give us a way to survive.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... That means that if we prevent the sale of Canned Knowledge, his daughter will...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I must get to the truth.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I can find someone to help treat your child, but I cannot turn a blind eye to the smuggling. These are two completely different issues.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 20.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' *sigh* I somehow knew you would say that, but having your word to help my daughter is enough for me. Since you insist on continuing the investigation, you should have a look around the back of my home.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 bahari 21.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' You'll find some goods I received just recently. I think everything will become clear to you once you see them.

:'''You go to the back of the house with Cyno.'''

:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Look at all of this!
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes, all neatly packed away and organized in boxes. To think that this is only one dealer's worth...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Small producers couldn't possibly support such a large quantity of goods. Hmm, could the Akademiya have a hand in this? But such a volume of goods wouldn't be able to slip through inspection...
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! These seem different from the other Knowledge Capsules we've seen. Maybe they contain knowledge about the Court of Desolation?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes, that would make sense. Wait, what's this...?
:{{DIcon}} Some sort of marking we've never seen before.
:{{DIcon}} Do you know what it is, Cyno?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes, it's a matra seal, indicating that the goods have passed matra inspection.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I started to suspect that someone in the Akademiya might be involved when I found the tracker earlier, but how they could ship so much Canned Knowledge out of the Akademiya was still a mystery.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The pieces have now all fallen into place. With this matra seal, goods can leave the Akademiya without undergoing a second inspection.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmph, no wonder they don't want me to investigate. It turns out that a matra is behind this. Even I find it hard to believe.
:{{DIcon}} It could be a misunderstanding.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Could I ask you for a favor, (Traveler)?
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Since all this Canned Knowledge came from the Akademiya, then it's highly likely that the knowledge regarding the Court of Desolation originated from research files stored within the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 17.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If we can enter the repository, we can find out who accessed these files.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 18.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But considering my current status, if I suddenly show up at the Akademiya now, it will only draw unnecessary attention.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 19.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You'll need to be the one who checks the records. I'll write a letter to [[Nabil]] and he'll take you there.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing, leave it to us!
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 20.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'll also keep working here in the meantime. Although our leads all are currently pointing to someone within the Akademiya, it's obvious that they also have power outside of it.
:{{A|vo cnlq002 9 cyno 21.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We can get more information on other dealers from Bahari. I'll stay here and make some preparations. You can come find me anytime if you uncover more info.
:;(Obtain [[Cyno's Introduction Letter]])

;(Talk to Simin, optional)<!--no ASTK-->
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq002 simin 01.ogg}} '''Simin:''' I just want to get better... I don't want to be stuck at home by myself anymore.

;(Talk to Cyno or Bahari, optional)<!--no ASTK-->
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq002 bahari 01.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' If you start sniffing around the Akademiya, it won't be long before people catch on to you.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq002 bahari 02.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' And once word gets out, they'll soon be after my daughter and I.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq002 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Don't worry. I'll find them before things escalate that far.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq002 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But if you still feel uneasy, then why don't you tell me about anyone else you know who was involved. The more information I have, the safer you will be.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq002 bahari 03.ogg}} '''Bahari:''' *sigh* Alright...
