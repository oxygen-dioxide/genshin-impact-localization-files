{{Enemy Intro}}

One [[Local Legend]] Arithmetic Enhancer Mek, the '''Automated Supercomputing Field Generator''', can be found in the [[Central Laboratory Ruins]] sub-area of the [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region]], just north of the [[Institute of Clockwork Applications]].

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Arkhe-Powered
|desc_1      = Arithmetic Enhancer Meks are powered by either {{Pneuma}} or {{Ousia}} and will use different attacks depending on their [[Arkhe]] alignment. Hitting it with the opposite Arkhe will cause it to lose Arkhe and become stunned for a short period of time. The Arithmetic Enhancer Mek is able to recover Arkhe much faster than other Clockwork Meka after being stunned.
|file_1_2    = Arithmetic Enhancer Mek Arkhe-Powered 2

|name_2      = Tail Swipe
|desc_2      = This attack is used when there are no Clockwork Meka with identical Arkhe alignment nearby. Attacks using its tail, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
}}

====Pneuma====
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = ATK Increase
|desc_1      = If there are {{Pneuma}}-aligned Clockwork Meka nearby, enters support mode and increases their [[ATK]] by '''20%'''.

|name_2      = Restore Pneuma
|desc_2      = If a nearby {{Pneuma}}-aligned Clockwork Meka has their Arkhe annihilated, the Arithmetic Enhancer Mek will restore their Arkhe.
}}

====Ousia====
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = RES Increase
|desc_1      = If there are {{Ousia}}-aligned Clockwork Meka nearby, enters support mode and increases their [[RES]] to all DMG by '''20%'''.

|name_2      = Restore Ousia
|desc_2      = If a nearby {{Ousia}}-aligned Clockwork Meka has their Arkhe annihilated, the Arithmetic Enhancer Mek will restore their Arkhe.
}}

===Local Legend===
{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Arithmetic Enhancer Mek Local Legend

|name_1      = Arkhe-Powered
|desc_1      = The Local Legend is powered by {{Ousia}}. Hitting it with the opposite Arkhe while it is not shielded will cause it to lose Arkhe and become stunned for a short period of time.

|name_2      = Geo Shield
|desc_2      = The Local Legend protects itself with a {{Geo}} [[Shield/Enemy|shield]] that grants it a '''200%''' increase to all [[RES]] while active and protects it from Annihilation Reactions caused by {{Pneuma}} attacks. The shield is weakest against [[Blunt Attack]]s. When destroyed, the shield will be regenerated after some time.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Geo|20}}

|name_3      = Gravity Reduction Field
|desc_3      = The Local Legend has a Gravity Reduction Field around it while Arkhe is available, which greatly boosts the jumping height of characters within.

|name_4      = Gravity Ripple
|desc_4      = Periodically sends out a shockwave that expands outwards that can be jumped over, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit. If used the second time during a single Gravity Reduction Field, releases three consecutive shockwaves at the end. This attack cannot be dodged using [[sprint]] [[i-frames]].

|name_5      = Enhanced Attack 2
|desc_5      = Consecutively detonates multiple explosions around itself, each dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} and spawns several rocks midair. The rocks then fire themselves at the player, each dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit.

|name_6      = Enhanced Attack 3
|desc_6      = Marks areas on the ground where rocks emerge from the ground after a short delay, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit.

|name_7      = Tail Swipe
|desc_7      = Attacks using its tail, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is only used when Arkhe is unavailable.

{{Description|A clockwork meka designed to transmit and enhance signals.<br>The power that drives this clockwork meka is generated from a controlled annihilation reaction between ousia and pneuma in the kinetic core. As a result, overloading it with excessive energy will cause its original equilibrium to be disrupted.|[[Archive]]}}
