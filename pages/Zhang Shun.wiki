==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Zhang Shun:''' What do you think of my wares, friend? Rare things to see on dry land.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Got anything good in?
::'''Zhang Shun:''' Every last item is a keepsake from a voyage across the oceans. Genuine goods at honest prices!
:{{DIcon}} Just what are these things from exactly?
::'''Zhang Shun:''' What? You think they're stolen?
::'''Zhang Shun:''' Of course not, I'm a sailor with The Crux. They're the spoils of years of service.
::'''Zhang Shun:''' But I got injured during the battle against Haishan. If it weren't for Captain [[Beidou]], I'd be a goner.
::'''Zhang Shun:''' So I decided it best I leave The Crux. Can't have a crewmate's old injury flaring up and dragging the crew under...
::'''Zhang Shun:''' At least the things I collected over the years is enough to keep me going though.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Tell me about your battle trophies.
:::'''Zhang Shun:''' Of all of them, this cup here is probably the one I'll never forget. Brings back memories of my drinking days.
:::'''Zhang Shun:''' ...But to be honest, now that I've decided to settle down and have a normal life, having it around only makes me sad that those days are over, which doesn't really help me move on.
:::'''Zhang Shun:''' Thanks for listening to me for so long. Actually, why don't I give this to you? Maybe it'll come in handy on one of your adventures.
::;(Obtain 3{{star}} [[Outset of the Brave]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(Unlocked after completing "[[Rite of Descension]]")
::'''Zhang Shun:''' Aye... In my many years spent sailing the open ocean, Captain Beidou took great delight in telling us many a tale of Rex Lapis' many feats.
::'''Zhang Shun:''' If Captain Beidou is the star that guides us in the night sky, then Rex Lapis is what keeps the whole sky up in place.
::'''Zhang Shun:''' I always said that I would see a Rite of Descension if I returned to land. I never thought...
:{{DIcon}} No need.
::'''Zhang Shun:''' Nothing takes your interest? Travel well.

===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Zhang Shun:''' Have you heard the news? Captain Beidou of the Crux brought something amazing back from overseas again!
:'''Zhang Shun:''' They say that it's the statue of an ancient adeptus... Or a god... Well, whatever it is, it's a really awesome statue!
:'''Zhang Shun:''' Well, it's the Crux Fleet, you know? Anything they're packing is bound to be good. Well then. Would you like something today, friend?

===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Zhang Shun:''' I heard that Captain Beidou took up some salvaging work recently. I wonder what treasures she'll dredge up this time...
:'''Zhang Shun:''' But since it's work from the [[Liyue Qixing|Qixing]], I doubt any of those treasures will ever find their way to me anyway.
:'''Zhang Shun:''' Still, I've got quite a few rare items that you can hardly find on land. Care to have a look?
