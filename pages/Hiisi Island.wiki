'''Hiisi Island''' is a location within [[Nod-Krai]] in [[Snezhnaya]]. It was first mentioned in the [[Song of the Welkin Moon]] event and is home to the [[Frostmoon Scions]].

According to [[Helka]], there are relics on the island that appear to have similar designs as [[Secret Source Automaton: Firepower Enhanced|Secret Source technology]], though all of them seem to be inactive or no longer working.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Helka|quote="I've seen relics of a similar stripe in Nod-Krai... Yeah, on the island where the Frostmoon Scions gather... But they're all as dead as dead can be"}}</ref>
