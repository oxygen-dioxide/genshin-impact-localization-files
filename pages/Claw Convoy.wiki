|Thank you so much for being willing to lend a hand to the cause of rescuing animals in need. They too are sentient beings, and they surely have long sensed your kindness.<br>Those with chivalry in their heart stand up for the weak of the world, and you, like me, have chosen to join the "Claw Convoy." From that, I may assume that you too nurse the desire to preserve the lives of living beings.<br>Next we meet, let us go to the mountains together to pay them a visit.<br>Though they have met you but once, some animals have excellent memories. Who knows, they may still recognize you!

|I'm guessing you probably don't know just where these little troublemakers came from:<br>Fluffball was captured along with her entire family by hunters, and they were planning to just kill the young along with the adults. My comrade thought that she was so tiny and piteous, and decided to buy her and bring her back.<br>That's how Braveheart, Pumpkin, and Fluffball all ended up here.<br>Though I support my comrade's decision, the Reconnaissance Company isn't the best place to raise these little guys, and so they need to learn some survival skills before they can be released back to live independently in the wild.<br>It's lucky the Claw Convoy is here to help, and thank you for your gift. Feel free to drop by the Company when you've got a moment, we'll treat you to a nice meal.

I'll leave musing on the grand truths of life to others &mdash; after all, I'm just a rock musician, and I don't like dealing in vagaries and hollow phrases.<br>I love the outdoors, and practicing singing out there with the animals.<br>They may not understand rock 'n' roll, but they understand freedom better than some people.<br>Treasure the time you spend with them, it's a gift to us from nature.

|Let me tell you a story:<br>A prince had just been born to a young and vigorous "King," whose health then suffered as a result. "Top Squirrel," who always had a penchant for petty thievery, took advantage of this moment of weakness to steal some branches from the "King"'s palace for his own home.<br>The hoodlum "Big Ears" thought the prince looked tasty, and so while the furious "King" was fighting with "Top Squirrel," he stealthily snuck behind the "King"'s back to make a meal out of the prince, but was knocked out at a blow by the "King," who just happened to turn around at that moment.<br>As for me, I simply happened to be passing by at that moment, and so I separated the three of them, who were locked in a struggle that had brought them to the brink of death, and took them to the Feiyun Commerce Guild to raise. Now, the three of them are at each other's throats every time they see one another, hahaha!
