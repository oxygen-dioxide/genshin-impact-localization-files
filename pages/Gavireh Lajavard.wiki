==Interactables==
===Bizarre Transcript===
This interactable is located by the campsite where [[Pyrrho]] is located, southwest of the [[Teleport Waypoint]] leading into the Temir Mountains and west of the Molten Iron Fortress domain.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:(Hastily scrawled notes transcribed from an [[Rene|unknown source]].)
:...The true source of the mysterious power unique to this place that the locals call [[Khvarena]] is unknown. But based on its ability to eliminate or reverse the influence of the [[Abyss]] (in fact, it is a type of annihilation reaction), the two powers are of the same level, that is to say, they are of the same order in terms of rules...
:...In other words, both possess the power to "re-write the rules"...
:...Regrettably, be it Abyss or Khvarena, all current users are stuck in an "unconscious" stage of being influenced and overwritten by their power...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Teachings of the Skeptics===
This interactable is located on an outpost behind the [[Statue of The Seven]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...Strict control over entry and exit of all mountain passes is necessary to ensure that the ceremony and plan can be completed...
:...Investigations into activity related to the [[Abyss Order]] can be postponed...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Khvarena Monument Inscription===
This interactable can be found after inserting all four [[Khvarena Inscription Fragment]]s during the {{Quest|Monumental Study (Quest)}}.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...With the power of [[Amrita]] and [[Khvarena]], we have extinguished the [[The Sign of Apaosha|phantoms mirroring the bedeviled sky]]...
:...Praise be to the spirits of the light, praise be the protection of the [[Khaenri'ah|Dahri]]! It is thanks to them that our great cause has come to fruition...
:...The Khvarena is without beginning or end, the Amrita is neither created nor destroyed, but must be kept pure through ritual prayer...
:...Let the inscription here serve as a warning. All who come after, be diligent and brave, fall not to decadence and neglect...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ancient Engineering Notes===
This interactable is located on the entrance walkway of the pipe room inside the underground [[Khaenri'ah]]n ruins.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:(These logs have been piled up amidst the junk. They are from an unknown era, though they appear to be quite ancient.)
:...Based on our projections, the [[Azosite]] concentration will exceed 60% after this round of smelting...
:...Though it still fares poorly when compared with that newly-discovered so-called "perpetual" energy source, after these energy alloys form a matrix, they should suffice to break through the technical bottleneck in energy efficiency requirements imposed by the large-scale "[[Ruin Golem|Mechanical Wardens]]"...
:...Not relying on some [[Abyss|dogma]] from beyond the heavens, but only upon the wondrous achievements brought about by human intelligence. If we continue to explore this path, perhaps we shall one day be able to create a true perputual machine...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ragged Engineering Notes===
This interactable is located on the left side of the upper floor of the smelting furnace room inside the underground Khaenri'ahn ruins.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:(Most of the content here has been deliberately erased, with only the title page retaining traces of legible text.)
:...After the smelting furnace in the Royal Machine Workshop "Gnade" was officially abandoned, this should be the last machine workshop in the [[Khaenri'ah|kingdom]] that still has a complete [[Azosite]]-powered system...
:...The efficiency problems posed by such a highly complex power system has proved intractable, so results of this nature are to be expected. Even for miniaturized, mass production units like [[Field Tiller]]s, using a power core is much more convenient...
:It may not be long before even this workshop is closed. After all, humanity is always shortsighted when it comes to technology...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Someone's Abandoned Letter===
This interactable is located in the room where the fight with [[Klingsor]] and [[Nasejuna]] occurs inside the underground Khaenri'ahn ruins, at the very bottom of the elevator.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:(This mangled letter looks to be unfinished, and it is unknown who left it here)
:...Eminent [[Anfortas|Marshal]]...
:...Of course, I am keenly aware that the four pillars of our [[Khaenri'ah|kingdom]] have achieved the prosperity they have today precisely thanks to us spying upon secrets from beyond the skies, and thus have our mechanisms been able to throw off the shackles imposed by [[Heavenly Principles|this world's laws]]...
:...But that technology... It cannot be said to be perfect...
:...The [[gods]] are untrustworthy and the [[Abyss|demons]], ineffable. If there is one thing that can pry open the corners of this hollow world, then it can only be human will...
:...To this end, if you can petition the [[Irmin|King]] to allow some machinery manufactured according to the old standard to be preserved under your ministry's purview, perhaps it may light a spark under the latent will of countless future generations to devote themselves to exploring technology...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Barely-Legible Bulletin===
This interactable is located immediately outside the room where the fight with [[Klingsor]] and [[Nasejuna]] occurs inside the underground Khaenri'ahn ruins.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:(A notice that once recorded important information, but the content has become nearly impossible to distinguish with the passage of time.)
:...In view of [[Irmin|King Irmin]]'s present indisposed state and the current [[Cataclysm|unknown threats]] facing the [[Khaenri'ah|Kingdom]]...
:...Knight Marshal [[Anfortas]] has proclaimed that he will temporarily take up the post of Regent and lead the Regnum Concilium Ultimum until the Kingdom returns to a state of normalcy...
:...
:...All citizens... wait... will...
:...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ancient Journal===
This interactable is located next to a [[Hydro Hilichurl Rogue]] below the Barely-Legible Bulletin interactable.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:(A journal that looks positively ancient, it is remarkably well-preserved &mdash; a function of its environment, perhaps.)
:...Most people fled [[Sumeru|aboveground]] with the [[Schwanenritter]], and only we are left hiding down here...
:...For my mother, this is as far as she can go. Even if we went into the wilderness, we would never survive. I have to stay together with my family...
:...Terrifying rumors are spreading. Those who went aboveground and returned say that they have personally witnessed those who fled to the surface being afflicted with a strange disease and turning into [[Hilichurls|monsters]]...
:...I don't know how long it's been. The surrounding area has calmed down, but our supplies have nearly been exhausted...
:...I can feel it. If things continue on this way, something terrible is going to happen, I must...
:...
:...There's no need to do anything anymore... It's too late...
:...Cities are collapsing, and perhaps this entire world will become a wasteland, but what does it matter? I wish I hadn't survived this long...
:(The rest of the handwriting suddenly becomes distorted and unreadable.)

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* ''Gavireh Lajavard'' comes from the Persian words {{Lang|''gawîre''|fa=گویره}}, the {{w|ezāfe}} form of the word {{Lang|''gawīr''|fa={{wt|کویر||Persian}}}}, meaning "desert," and lajavard, from the Persian {{Lang|''lâjvard, lâjavard''|fa={{wt|لاجورد||Persian}}}}, meaning "lapis lazuli" or "azure." Taken together, they mean "azure desert."
