==Steps==
# Venture beyond the seal
#* Enter the Domain [[Storming Terror]]. The battle is split into two parts for the two crystals [[Dvalin]] has on his back.
# Ride the winds to defeat Dvalin
#*The first part is the same air battle from [[Dragon Storm]], with the addition of dodging Dvalin's attacks and flying through rings.
#*You control only the Traveler for this part, regardless of whether the Traveler is part of your active party or not.
#*If you find yourself having a difficult time dodging, eat something that regenerates health over time like [[Radish Veggie Soup]].
#*When Dvalin accelerates out of your attack range, destroy Anemo orbs to create acceleration rings. Fly through the rings to catch up to him.
# Defeat Dvalin
#*The second part is fighting Dvalin. [[Venti]] will be added to your party.
#*You can use Venti or other long-range fighters to attack Dvalin when he's flying.
#*Breaking Dvalin's shield will cause him to collapse on a platform and expose the crystal. You have enough time to climb up his neck and attack it, or enter Aimed Shot Mode with Venti and shoot at the crystal.
#*When the floor is covered with white cracks that constantly deal damage, glide a couple of platforms away until you land on a safe one.

==Notes==
* [[Barbara]] is not directly awarded from this quest, but rather from [[Baptism of Song]], which can be found in the [[Events]] menu.

==Achievements==
* Completing this quest will grant the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Winds Change Their Course]]."

;(During the first phase of the fight)
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Look! There are {{Color|buzzword|two shiny spots}} on Dvalin's back!
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' They appear to be poisonous blood clots that have coagulated on his wounds...
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The Abyss Order must have cursed the wounds. That's what's corrupting Dvalin's mind.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' To save Dvalin, we're going to have to get rid of those {{Color|buzzword|blood clots}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Aim for those blood clots!
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Dvalin is getting away... but I am familiar with his tactics. Just hold on a bit longer.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I'll extract and condense the pure Anemo from the shots being fired.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Shattering them will create {{Color|buzzword|acceleration currents}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I can't control where they will appear, so keep your eyes peeled.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Shatter the {{Color|buzzword|condensed Anemo orbs}} to create {{Color|buzzword|acceleration currents}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I know it's hard to tell amidst the barrage of bullets, but this is the only way.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 2 venti 12.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Dvalin... I'm sorry this is hurting you... Hang on, just one more!
----
;(During the second phase of the fight)
<!--:'''Venti:''' With the help of the best bard in the world, we are now on par with Dvalin.--><!-- Unused? -->
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Now we can fight Dvalin on equal grounds. The grandest bard is here to help!
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But first, let me be clear...
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Even after hundreds of years without use, Dvalin's teeth and claws are still very dangerous.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' A-ha, this is Dvalin's ace in the hole: Caelestinum Finale Termini!
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...This dragon has strange taste when it comes to naming things.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I named it for him just now.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously!?
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Well... Anyway, let's ride the {{Color|buzzword|wind currents}} and stay away from the breaking platforms.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The energy flooding out from the fissures will be hot. Be sure to watch your step.
:{{A|vo mdaq069 3 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Now is our chance! Aim for the tainted blood clot on his neck!
----
;(After defeating the Stormterror, a cutscene begins. The platforms give in, and everyone loses their footing.)
:'''Paimon:''' This place is gonna collapse!
:;(Dvalin rescues everyone from falling, and flies away with everyone on his back)
:'''Venti:''' It's been a while since we flew like this together, huh, Dvalin?
:'''Dvalin:''' Just now... Why... Why did you not ask me to protect you like the last time?
:'''Venti:''' Me not wanting you to listen to the Abyss Order doesn't mean that you have to listen to me.
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Freedom, if demanded of you by an archon, is really no freedom at all.
:'''Dvalin:''' Is this... the power of the Anemo Archon? But I am no longer part of the Four Winds.
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Even if that's so, you still protected us regardless.
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Now, spread your wings of freedom and go with my blessing.

:;(Back in Mondstadt)
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' And so, the Stormterror threat was quelled.
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I clarified the misunderstanding to the citizens of Mondstadt
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' and let them know that they are safe.
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' To them it seems Stormterror attacked Mondstadt out of nowhere
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' and then vanished just as quickly.
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' They must be finding the whole ordeal very confusing.
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' However, winds change their course.
:{{A|vo mdaq071 1 cs venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Someday, they will blow towards a brighter future.
