{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to the lone Raven in the tower)
:'''Flight Master:''' Heh. I never expected that someone else would find this place...
:'''Flight Master:''' This route was created specifically to hone one's flight skills. I shall not suffer anyone without our Prinzessin's [[Nightwatch Contract]] to use it!
:'''Flight Master:''' I believe I mentioned this before: I shall not suffer anyone without our Prinzessin's Nightwatch Contract to use this path!

;(Talk to the Flight Master after submitting a Nightwatch Contract)
:'''Flight Master:''' I say, this is indeed a Nightwatch Contract penned by our Prinzessin...
:'''Flight Master:''' Well! I know not how Her Highness gave you leave, but it seems you are a figure of some standing at least. Still, I caution you that this route is most perilous.
:'''Flight Master:''' I recommend you reconsider. When you are truly ready and willing to recant any doubt or concern and resolutely travel upon this route, then seek me again.

;(Talk to the Flight Master again)
:'''Flight Master:''' Hmm, a brave soul you are! It seems you are well-resolved. Good. Good! Then prove that you have the skill to conquer this route!

;(Talk to the Flight Master after completing the flight)
:'''Flight Master:''' Your elegant trail through the skies is awe-inspiring indeed. Verily, I acknowledge your skill. Come then. Receive your reward for conquering this route, valiant flyer!
:'''Flight Master:''' Yea, though the perils of flight are brief, those who experience that apex of euphoria shall not forget it.
:'''Flight Master:''' May this sea remember your valiant form forevermore!
:;(A Common Chest appears)
