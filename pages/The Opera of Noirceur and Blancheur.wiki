;(Continues from previous quest)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 01.ogg}} '''Uh... Furina?:''' Pfft... Hahahaha...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 02.ogg}} '''Uh... Furina?:''' ...Sorry! That shocked expression on your face is just too amusing, I couldn't help myself.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You are not Furina. Who are you?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 03.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Ah, the sweet sound of bewilderment. Marvelous! A sure sign that my attempt to deceive everyone was a resounding success... But to answer your question: I am Focalors. You know? The god?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Focalors... Why did you deceive us?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 04.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Oh, that wasn't my goal, of course. Goodness, no! But I had to fool everyone else, too, if I was to stand any chance of deceiving...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 05.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' ...The [[Heavenly Principles]].
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Deceiving the Heavenly Principles...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 06.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' It's all because of that pernicious prophecy. Dreadful, wasn't it? Everyone doomed to dissolve, Fontaine condemned to be flooded...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 07.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' One was not amused, in fact, one was positively bemused, when that problem was thrust upon me by my dearest predecessor &mdash; that's the former Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]], for the uninitiated. It hardly gets more disastrous than a preordained national catastrophe, now does it?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 08.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' She knew full well that the prophecy would surely come to pass.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 09.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' And as one of [[The Seven]], she also knew full well that... one defies the Heavenly Principles at one's peril.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 10.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' So yes, as you have no doubt surmised, it was a rather impossible situation that I found myself in.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 11.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' I spent a terribly long time mulling it over, alone on the ocean floor... and I was almost growing barnacles by the time I finally realized: There was only one possible solution to this confounding conundrum.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 12.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' I had to outwit the Heavenly Principles. Allow the prophecy to be fulfilled, ostensibly at least, while saving everyone at the same time.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 13.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' I'm a genius, I know. I can only assume that's why Egeria chose me as her successor.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 14.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Although looking back now, it was hardly the inheritance one dreams of... Between the task of saving the nation, the quotidian duties of the Hydro Archon, and not to mention the original sin of creating a new race of humans, I dare say she left me quite a colossal mess to clean up.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 15.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' *sigh* But one can only play the hand one is dealt. I did not choose this, any more than I chose to be one of her Oceanid familiars.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' So, you were also once one of the Oceanids, transformed into a human by Egeria's hand?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 16.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Yes, I was. I always dreamed of becoming human... And I still do, even now. In my eyes, to be human is to be part of the greatest opera ever known.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 17.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' After becoming a god, I separated my divinity from my body and spirit, leaving behind only a self that was as naive and bewildered as my past self on her first day as a human being.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 18.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' The "me" you see before you now is that "divinity," and the human counterpart I left behind, I named "Furina."
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 19.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' She could feel joy, sorrow, and everything in between. She could be as vain and conceited, or as meek and vulnerable as she wished...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 20.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Her strengths were of a kind only a human could possess, as were her shortcomings.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 21.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' But in my eyes, Furina's humanity was what made her perfect. She was perfectly human in every way... the person I always wanted to be.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 22.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Anyway &mdash; so then I cursed her.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 23.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' ...All part of the plan, of course. The plan to deceive the Heavenly Principles.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 24.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Do you still remember the final scene of the prophecy? The Hydro Archon, alone, weeping on her throne.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 25.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' In order that the prophecy might appear fulfilled, I invited Furina to be an actress: to play the part of the Hydro Archon in the prophecy.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 26.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Under the curse I placed on her, so long as I, Focalors' divinity, continued to exist, she could not die. But nor was she free to live her life in the pursuit of happiness.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 27.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Instead, she was forced to take the stage in the opera house, to embrace the role of leading lady, to forever play the part of the god from the prophecy... All to create a deceitful appearance of that prophecy coming to pass.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 28.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' I suppose now you probably understand why your court is called the “Opera Epiclese.”
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...But Furina is only human, isn't she?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Even though she has had a long life, her mind is no stronger than that of any other ordinary human being.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I cannot begin to fathom what she has had to endure... It must have been torture for her.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 29.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' It has indeed. And although she is, in a sense, "me" in human form... I most definitely owe her an apology for it.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 30.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' It's been five hundred years...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 focalors 31.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' ...And all along, she's been playing her part in the most unimaginably long, unbearably lonely, and agonizingly painful opera of all time.
:;(Meanwhile, the Traveler awakens)<!-- black screen transition -->
<!--:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Where am I? Am I still in the opera house? No. That's not quite right...)--><!--unused?-->
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I came into contact with Furina's... tears? If I remember correctly, tears often contain a being's strongest emotions...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (With sufficiently strong Hydro sensitivity, I can form an emotional connection, just like I did with that Oceanid at the Fountain of Lucine...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Wait, could this be... Furina's inner world?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Furina? What is she doing onstage? Wait a moment. That probably isn't Furina. That's likely a reflection of her "inner self.")
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (If I can directly speak to that self, I might be able to easily get what I wanted to know.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I came here for answers. Either way, this opportunity is not to be missed. Let me try talking to her.)

;(Talk to Furina)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh? Who permitted you to come onto this stage? Now, I understand your admiration for my august self, but I must ask you to keep to the rules.
:{{DIcon}} Come on, it's me.
:{{DIcon}} Uh... Furina?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, alright, it is not my intent to reprimand you. There is no need to state your name. Just be off with you &mdash; do not distract me from my performance.
:(Don't look at me, don't look at me...)
:{{DIcon}} But...
:{{DIcon}} I don't see an audience here?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hah. Do not jest. Can you not feel it?
:(Just let the stage lights go off, please, if only for one second...)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I am Focalors. The eyes of countless Fontainians are upon me. I must, at all times, display the utmost elegance and nobility.
:(...That way, I can... become "myself" again...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Something's off. There's no getting through to her &mdash; even in her heart of hearts, she's still "playing" the role of the Hydro Archon...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What sort of resolve must she have that even her inner self and subconscious would have such an impenetrable defense?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I have to find a way...)

;(Talk to Furina, optional)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Something's off. There's no getting through to her &mdash; even in her heart of hearts, she's still "playing" the role of the Hydro Archon...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What sort of resolve must she have that even her inner self and subconscious would have such an impenetrable defense?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I have to find a way...)

;(Turn off the first spotlight)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Dear audience, the performance is experiencing a technical difficulty, but worry not! The guards shall resolve it soon enough!

;(Turn off the second spotlight)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 1 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey! What gives!? The audience is still watching me, you know! Guards! Wait, where are the guards? GUARDS!

;(After turning off all three spotlights)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (That's all the spotlights turned off. In Furina's heart, they must have symbolized the eyes of the people on her.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Speaking of which, I think I just received some sort of signal. Was that her true voice?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Hmm...? A ticket? When did that end up here?)
:[[File:The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur Ticket.png|120px]]
:;(A spotlight shines on one of the seats in the audience)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Either way, looks like the show is about to begin. In that case, show me how you truly feel, Furina.)

:{{Black Screen|Scene 1, Before a Mirror, Furina}}

;(Approach the mirror)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Furina... Furina...?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? Who's that? Who's calling me? Where are you?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 02.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Be not nervous. Be not afraid. I am before you.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' W&mdash;W&mdash;Wait a moment! You're... mirror-me? How can this be?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 03.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Hmmm. "Mirror-you," huh? You know what? That's not bad. Let's go with that.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' "Mirror-me"... Wh&mdash;What do you wish to say?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 04.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' The "prophecy"... Have you heard of it?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What prophecy...? Oh, wait. I know &mdash; I think. I don't know why, but it's... in my head somehow...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' "The people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne. Only then will the sins of the people of Fontaine be washed away."
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 05.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Oh, very good. You know it well.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What's... going on? I can't seem to remember... anything clearly. The only thing I know for sure is this prophecy... Will it really come to pass?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 06.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Yes, it will, and that is why I've come to you. Disaster will come to Fontaine sooner or later. Things will develop just as the prophecy declared &mdash; there is no escaping it.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But... Doesn't that mean everyone will die? I'm a Fontainian just like them &mdash; will I dissolve too?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 07.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Hehehe... Don't worry. Magical meetings exist in this world precisely to give people a chance to turn things around. It is the reason why you met me today.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 08.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' I will tell you how to save everyone, but... you may have to suffer somewhat...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' O&mdash;Oh, so there's still hope after all? Goodness, you frightened me &mdash; you spoke so much, and with so much certainty...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' As for the suffering... Well, I will admit that the first thing that came to mind was, "Why do I have to be the one to suffer?"...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But if the prophecy will come true, I'll also die anyway, right? So if I've already met you as my magical meeting in this world...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If there were scales, with all the people of Fontaine on one side, and my pain on the other... Is it not obvious where the scales should tilt?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 09.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Hehe... You truly are the perfect human &mdash; my "ideal."
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 10.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' I suppose this would also be the "justice" that belongs to you.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh...?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 11.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Don't worry, it's nothing. Listen well. Fontaine has just lost its Hydro Archon. I need you to "play" a role &mdash; that of the new Archon.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Play as... a god?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 12.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' That's right. You must begin a never-ending masquerade. You must never let anyone suspect your identity...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 13.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' If you can keep it up, then I shall have my way of defying this prophecy... But should your identity be revealed, then all hope will be lost.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But... how will I do this? A human assuming the role of a god without being exposed...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 14.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Don't worry. What you must do is not to turn yourself into a real god. You simply need to play the role of a god as humans imagine them to be.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 15.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Being a human yourself, I'm sure you already know what such an entity would be like.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 16.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' Remember, your true challenge will not be pursuing "divinity," but contending against "humanity."
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Um... I'm still not sure I understand, but... I'll try. I'll try to do this.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So, how long am I going to have to play this role?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 17.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' To accomplish this mission, you will have to stay on the stage for many, many years. You will endure and not grow old until your task ends.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 focalors 18.ogg}} '''Person in the Mirror:''' But I promise you... all will eventually end in a magnificent and dramatic trial, and everyone will be saved.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 2 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' A trial, huh... How exciting. I'll be looking forward to it.

:{{Black Screen|Scene 2, Accession Speech, Furina}}

;(Approach the throne)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Phew. The [[Maison Cardinalice]] has announced my accession, but this is my first time facing the people...)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (What should I say... to most appear like a god? To be honest, I still don't know. Perhaps I should first try to act natural...)
:{{DIcon}} Summon Courage
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *cough* Um, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, and welcome to the Opera Epiclese.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sure you've all heard about how I have taken on the role of Hydro Archon. Indeed, I am Furina de Fontaine, your new Archon.
:{{DIcon}} Appear Earnest
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' In truth, I know little about becoming a nation's new god, but it will be my honor to guide you all.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' As the god Focalors &mdash; the God of Justice &mdash; I shall do all within my power to lead you into an age of fairness and justice.
:{{DIcon}} Close Politely
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Once again, thank you all for coming. If you should have any questions or suggestions, please send them to the Maison Cardinalice &mdash; the future of Fontaine will require us to work together, after all.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (This... should do it.)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (I thought I might stammer, but thankfully, I was able to convey my thoughts just fine. Okay, and next...)
:;(Spotlights begin to light up above the theater seats)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 audiencea 01.ogg}} '''Questioning Audience Member:''' That's the new Hydro Archon? Is this some kind of joke by the Maison? I would've thought that a being that surpasses humanity would be a bit more... assertive...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 audienceb 01.ogg}} '''Jeering Audience Member:''' Hey, did you hear that? She even told us to send her suggestions there at the end...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 audiencec 01.ogg}} '''Frustrated Audience Member:''' Shouldn't gods be all-powerful? She's being so modest... What's the difference between her and an ordinary person, then?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 audienced 01.ogg}} '''Skeptical Audience Member:''' If you ask me... Perhaps the succession didn't actually happen. She might just be a Maison-backed puppet!
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Wait, what's going on? Why is everyone suspecting me of being a fake? Oh, this is bad. If I get exposed here... there'll be no saving the people from the prophecy...)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Right! "Mirror-me" said that I just need to play the role of a god as humans imagine them to be...)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Calm down, Furina... Think. Think. What do the people want? How would they imagine a god to speak and act?)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Assertive, with a strong sense of presence, one who can dispel all doubt... That is the character I'm fated to play...)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hahahaha!&nbsp;...Very good, my people. Only ones such as you are deserving of my rule.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Now, I was wondering &mdash; if some weak puppet were to one day come onto the stage and claim ownership of this opera house, would the children of Fontaine follow them?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Well! It seems that you would all see right through them. Having passed my test, you are qualified to witness wondrous trials alongside my august self, here in this opera house!
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You may consider my previous "act" a door gift of sorts. I thought it was a debut that suited the atmosphere.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Now then, let us be re-introduced!
:;(The spotlights over the audience turn off one by one)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 audiencee 01.ogg}} '''Eureka-Moment Audience Member:''' Ah, so that was just a performance! How could I have forgotten that we were inside an opera house?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 audiencef 01.ogg}} '''Agreeing Audience Member:''' Such personality! It's quite shocking, to be honest, but I suppose it's a better look than before...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 audienceg 01.ogg}} '''Delighted Audience Member:''' Such a fascinating and bold deity. How wonderful! Our future may yet be bright after all...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (It seems I've turned them around. Best follow this flow and restart my accession speech...)
:{{DIcon}}  Summon Courage
:{{DIcon}}  Resolutely, with Conviction
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' My dear people. Whether you acknowledge me or not, whether you trust me or nay, I say to you &mdash; keep faith in your ardor for justice!
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' We have heard it said that this nation's sins can no longer be washed away. Well, I say that justice is most fragrant when it blooms amid sin!
:{{DIcon}} Appear Earnest

:{{DIcon}} Turn up the Drama
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 24.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The scales of justice should not weigh heavy in the hands of its god. On one side, it must carry fairness and justice, and on the other, praise and applause.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 25.ogg}} '''Furina:''' May law be the prayer on our lips. May judgment be our worship. Let us light the fires, and drink to the future of Fontaine!
:{{DIcon}} Close Politely

:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 27.ogg}} '''Furina:''' There is no trouble in this world that justice cannot solve. All that is needed is for you, my people, to believe in it, heart and soul.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 3 furina 28.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So long as I, the Archon Focalors, stand within the Opera Epiclese... so long as I stand before the Oratrice... I shall even judge the gods of this world!

:{{Black Screen|Scene 3, Opera House, Furina}}

;(Approach the desk)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 4 cipherb 01.ogg}} '''Unknown Voice:''' Lady Furina, here are today's case reports as well as a summary of the follow-up, for your perusal...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 4 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *sigh* Come now, was I not just at the opera house in person? Leave these kinds of things to Neuvillette.

:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' So even Furina doesn't know the truth? You've never once let her in on the full plan?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 01.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Yes. It had to be done. To deceive the Heavenly Principles, you must first deceive yourself.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 02.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' She did very well. If she had let her resolve falter even once in these five centuries, Fontaine would have been doomed to the most tragic fate.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 03.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' It seems that "trusting humanity" was the right decision, after all.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I believe that I understand how your deception works... but that is only half the truth, is it not?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' How would you build on this foundation to save the people of Fontaine? That is the most important thing.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 04.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Ah, good, good. Of course the Iudex of Fontaine has pinpointed the crux of the issue.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 05.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' I'm sure you've long sensed that the [[Oratrice]] is no simple machine, yes?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I've always suspected that it had its own consciousness, and Lyney did mention that he heard a "human voice" within the core chamber...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It now seems that that "person" was you, hidden within the machine all along. Am I right?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 06.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' And then I "became one" with the Oratrice, taking Fontaine's Gnosis with me... Yes, it would seem so, wouldn't it?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 07.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Alas, your understanding of this device still lacks sufficient depth.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 08.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' In truth, it is no enactor of justice... It is, in fact, a device created to kill the God of Justice.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...I beg your pardon?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 09.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Oh, you have it &mdash; and to be more precise, not only will the Oratrice take down the God of Justice, it will also take down the divine throne upon which she has been placed.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 10.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Hehe, I mean, did you think I would be the sort to enjoy peaceful repose while Furina suffered?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 11.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' My work over these last five hundred years... has been to constantly accumulate Indemnitium within the Oratrice.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 12.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' But really, some have already discovered that only a small fraction of the energy generated by the device was ever used to provide power to Fontaine...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 13.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' The vast majority has been &mdash; had to be &mdash; accumulated... to enact this death sentence.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It was all a part of your plan, then &mdash; both the trial and the sentence...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 14.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Indeed. This power, accrued over five centuries, could have sustained Fontainians for millennia had it only been used for that purpose. Almost all of it has now been stored within the Oratrice...
:[[File:The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur Still 1.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 15.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' But only power of this magnitude could hope to destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne, shaking the rules established by Celestia and breaking through the institution that is The Seven.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' So, the Oratrice's call for death was for neither Furina nor Focalors, but for the Hydro Archon...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The destruction of that divine throne... If I do not misunderstand your intent, you must be...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 16.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Returning what's rightfully yours to you, of course!
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 17.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' In other words, this was all done to return the authority of the Hydro Archon to the Hydro Dragon of this planet.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 18.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' What? Getting sad again, are we?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 19.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' The authority of the ancient dragons shall soon be yours once more, O Hydro Dragon Sovereign, and this is the face you make? Hehe...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' All you've done throughout the years... is just so you can sacrifice yourself at the very end?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 20.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' I've never quite seen it that way, you know. Even now, I'm quite pleased at how well my deception worked, hehe.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 21.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry."
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 22.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' I must say, had it been within my rights, I would have loved to judge the Heavenly Principles themselves. Were they not guilty of essentially the same crime?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 23.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Egeria stole the power of the Primordial Sea, and the Heavenly Principles stole the power you ancient dragons possessed.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 24.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' I, for my part, am the God of Justice. And is it not just that your original powers should be returned to you?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 25.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Speaking of justice, I have always believed that justice lies in the process of pursuing human existence itself.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 26.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' So if the theft of the Primordial Sea's might was Fontaine's "original sin"...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 27.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Then, leaving matters of procedural right and wrong aside, the descent of the Fontainians as humans and their right to exist in this world... would be Fontaine's "original justice."
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 28.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' In other words, "existence" was Egeria's justice... and to me, justice is the "continuation" of that existence.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 29.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Defying the prophecy and ensuring that Fontaine's people shall live on &mdash; that should be the justice enthroned over all others.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 30.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' At this point, we &mdash; whether it be myself, or all other Fontainians &mdash; have shouldered the burden of this "sin" for far too long.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 focalors 31.ogg}} '''Focalors:''' Iudex Neuvillette, the highest judge in our land... When you regain your full power as an elemental sovereign, what verdict shall you pass upon us?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' So, when I was invited to the Court of Fontaine to serve as Iudex... I see now that that was your idea, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' At last, I now understand the true purpose behind this position.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In the beginning, I was uninterested in human existence, but these five centuries of living alongside them have gradually brought about mutual understanding between us, and I have even attempted to feel as they feel...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You are a devious one, Focalors.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 11 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Things being as they are... Surely you know that I could never again declare them to be "guilty."

:{{A|vo fdaq306 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aaahhh! We're about to be eaten!

;(Within the All-Devouring Narwhal)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why's there hole-looking thingy over there? It looks... really scary...

;(During the fight)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 12 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Manifest the authority of the ancient dragons. Witness the might of the Primordial Sea.

;(After defeating the All-Devouring Narwhal)
:{{Cutscene Description|You engage in a fierce battle against the All-Devouring Narwhal. At the last, you leap out from the belly of the beast, and Neuvillette lands beside you, gathering his might to finish the creature off.<br>At this time, another strange energy shrouds the creature and shrinks it until it falls into the palm of a mysterious woman's hand.<br>She grabs the shrunken Narwhal in one hand and the unconscious Childe by the scruff in another. Opening a teleporter, she throws them both into it.<br>After that, she turns around to face you, as if nothing had happened.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Thanks for helping with the "cleanup." It should've been my job, but... Oh well.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 02.ogg}} '''???:''' It was just supposed to be a short private training session for me... I didn't think that my disciple and my master's pet would start brawling in the meantime.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Well, actually, I had a feeling that it would happen at some point, but they bumped into one another earlier than I'd thought. What a blunder... I suppose I'll have to swing my sword three million times as penance.
:{{DIcon}} Disciple...?
:{{DIcon}} Your master's pet?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That power... Who are you, exactly?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon has an idea... From what she said earlier, she must be Childe's master... Skirk, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just that he gave us the impression that she was a less... talkative person.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 04.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' I simply did not have anything to say to the weak. But you, on the other hand, managed to defeat the All-Devouring Narwhal without using "power from beyond this world"...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 05.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' So you may speak to me as equals.
:{{DIcon}} What sort of person...
:{{DIcon}} ...Would take the All-Devouring Narwhal as a pet?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 06.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' I have to agree. It's a strange use of a planet's primordial waters just to raise an All-Devouring Narwhal.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 07.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' That kind of power is wasted on it. It's not cooperative, it eats too much... and I have more important things to do with my time than pet-sitting. The only thing that creature has going for it is its looks.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 08.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' All in all, it fails as a pet.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Uh, Miss Skirk, I think you might have missed the point.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 09.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' The point being?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, being that this "pet" almost destroyed an entire nation...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what sort of person is your master &mdash; well, Childe's master's master?&nbsp;...Is that right?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 10.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Ah, right, so you don't know him... Sorry, I assumed you did.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 11.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' His name is [[Surtalogi]].
:{{DIcon}} Who?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I am unfamiliar with that name.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 12.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Huh. So Master is insufficiently famous. Hmm, how should I describe him, then... Have you heard of the name... "The Foul"?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' "The Foul"...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 13.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Still nothing? Well, how about "The Visionary," [[Vedrfolnir]] then? Or "Gold," [[Rhinedottir]]?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, that one we've heard! Rhinedottir's part of the [[Hexenzirkel]] &mdash; she's Albedo's mom, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 14.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Ah, so you do know that name. To be honest, I also heard all of those names and titles from my Master. I don't actually know them either.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 15.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' But I suppose you understand now, yes? My Master is likely a similar sort to Rhinedottir &mdash; they are both "pursuing some form of perfection."
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait. Didn't you also mention a... "Visionary" person? Paimon didn't quite catch their name...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 16.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Actually, never mind that. I believe it expedient to inform you...
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 17.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' That the All-Devouring Narwhal used up nearly all its strength fighting you.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 18.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Such roiling Hydro energies will prove difficult for the planet's deep seas to digest.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 19.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' As such, the Fontaine back on the surface has most likely been thrown into chaos.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 skirk 20.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' In other words, the prophecy that you have been fretting over should now be in full swing.
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{DIcon}} No...
:{{DIcon}} ...There's little to be surprised about, Paimon.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It is natural, after all. The prophecy will surely come true. We knew this... and accepted it.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (However...)
:{{A|vo fdaq306 13 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Not to worry. Focalors has... already managed to deceive the Heavenly Principles.

==Trivia==
* The cinematic of Focalors' execution contains two text cards written in [[Teyvat Script]], with subtitles written in the Latin alphabet. However, the subtitles do not exactly match the original text, though the meaning is basically the same:
** The first card's subtitle reads "Thank you, Furina / For all you've done," but the original text says "It's been tough for you / Furina."
** The second card's subtitle is "From this moment on / Please live happily as a human / Just as I wished we could," while the actual text reads "Pray live blissfully / As a human / For that is what I wished for."
