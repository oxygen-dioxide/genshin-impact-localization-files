The '''House of Purbiruni''' is an esteemed lineage of researchers in [[Sumeru]], descended from the sage Biruni.

==Overview==
The patriarch of the Purbiruni lineage was Biruni, a sage who lived 500 years ago.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Sea-Beast}}</ref>

At some point, the House of Purbiruni and the [[House of Pursina]] were rivals in the field of astrology. Since then, it appears that the two families have become rather close,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Khedive}}</ref> and [[Khedive|Khedive Pursina]] is even a member of the Purbiruni school.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Spike Self-Circulation Report: Conclusion (Part 2)}}</ref> Following the events at [[The Chasm]] and as a reward for the help they provided, Khedive gives the [[Traveler]] an [[Akademiya Recommendation Letter]] to enlist the Purbirunis' assistance.
