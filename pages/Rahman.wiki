==Profile==
Rahman is a friend of [[Dehya]] and was raised in the desert. He is a devout follower of the [[Scarlet King]]. During the events of ''[[King Deshret and the Three Magi]]'', Rahman was manipulated by the Akademiya's misinformation campaign into kidnapping the Village Keepers of [[Aaru Village]] under the belief that the Scarlet King would return. Dehya tries to persuade Rahman to side with her, [[Alhaitham]], [[Cyno]], and the Traveler and convince him and his [[Eremites]] that they are on the same side and that their common enemy are the sages of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]], although he initially refuses to believe such a claim. Dehya offers her arm in return for the Village Keepers, which Rahman initially agrees with, but soon finds himself unable to go with the act and instead proposes for a duel the following day.

During their fight, Dehya easily overpowers Rahman, but an earthquake causes the entire group to fall into some [[Mysterious Ruins|mysterious ruins]] which they investigate. They learn from [[Kasala]] that Rukkhadevata and King Deshret were never enemies in the first place but worked together. After realizing this, Rahman apologizes to the group for being misled and informs the rest of his group of the truth. He also turns in [[Judar]] of the Akademiya as he was responsible for kidnapping the Village Keepers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>

Rahman and his men later infiltrated [[Sumeru City]] through a plan devised by [[Alhaitham]], where they would fight the [[Corps of Thirty]] under the pretense that their illegal activities had been discovered. Once there, they laid low before surrounding and subduing the guards at the Grand Bazaar. After the sages' plot was foiled and Kusanali freed, Rahman returned to the desert alongside [[Setaria]], where she revealed that she had approached Rahman to find Eremites suitable to teach and spread knowledge across the desert, something which he agreed with. He was also working with [[Cyno]] to help bring badly needed academic materials to the people of the desert. The Traveler offered them some invitations to the celebratory feast, although Rahman declined as he had to take care of Setaria.

===Personality===
Rahman is a follower of the Scarlet King like many Eremites living in the [[Great Red Sand]]. He is also friends with Dehya, although during the events of the Archon Quest, he clashes with her over their true enemy. Despite falling for the Akademiya's propaganda, Rahman is reasonable, having initially accepted Dehya's arm in return for the Village Keepers, although he quickly relented due to realizing it as unnecessary violence against his own.

Upon being shown the truth between the Scarlet King and Rukkhadevata, Rahman initially found it hard to accept the truth, but after [[Alhaitham]] pointed out that it was the Scarlet King's technology that held the knowledge, he quickly apologized for being misled and devoted whatever resources he could to help out.

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:'''Rahman:''' Well now, if it isn't our new friend!
:'''Rahman:''' How are things going? How's your mood? Everything going fine?
:{{DIcon}} Fine. And you?
::'''Rahman:''' Well, if I may be frank? Things are changing so very suddenly... It's hard not to feel lost.
::'''Rahman:''' That's the truth of the matter, I fear.
::'''Rahman:''' Though I'm not fond of the people on the other side of the Wall of Samiel, I'd like to think myself the sensible sort &mdash; I won't be having any further delusions about King Deshret's revival.
::'''Rahman:''' We're friends now, I say &mdash; should you need me, I won't just stand idly by and watch.
::'''Rahman:''' If I might say something else, I would warn you that you're up against the lofty Akademiya. Whatever you do, you've got to be careful.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing new.
::'''Rahman:''' Haha! Is that how it is? Well, whatever, keep on keeping on.

;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:'''Rahman:''' We meet again. How have you been recently? Have things settled down a bit for you?
:{{DIcon}} A bit is about right. And you?
::'''Rahman:''' Hah, well, I've actually gotten busier recently. Other than completing the work that Cyno has assigned to us, I still have my lady's protection to worry about.
::'''Rahman:''' By "my lady," I mean Ms. Setaria, whom I'm sure you know. She left the Akademiya recently &mdash; with permission, of course.
::'''Rahman:''' She wants to pass on the things she knows to the desert people. Both Lesser Lord Kusanali and Cyno have approved of this plan, and they've both helped quite a bit, too.
::'''Rahman:''' Ah, this is a blessing that is hard to come by, especially for us, the children of King Deshret. We must hold it most dear indeed.
:{{DIcon}} Things aren't going too differently for me.
::'''Rahman:''' Is that so? Well then, please stay safe while you're out exploring.
::'''Rahman:''' If there's anything I can help you with, don't hesitate to ask. I'll be here for the foreseeable future, in any case.
