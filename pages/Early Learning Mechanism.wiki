'''Early Learning Mechanism''' is a quest in [[Faruzan]]'s [[Hangout Event]], Act I: [[A Confounding Conundrum]].

==Steps==
# Go to [[Port Ormos]] and look for Anis
# Talk to the staff at [[Acara Crafts]]
# Leave Port Ormos
# Wait until two days later
# Head to the conference

==Gameplay Notes==
* The ''[[Memories of the Heart]]'' achievement ''[[Mechanics: From Beginner to...?]]'' is granted for correctly answering Faruzan's question about the lowest number of steps needed to complete a seven-layer "Pagoda Stack"
** The "Pagoda Stack" game is based on the {{w|Tower of Hanoi}} puzzle. The minimal number of moves required to solve the puzzle is calculated as <code>2<sup><i>n</i></sup> - 1</code> where <i><code>n</code></i> is the number of disks. 
** The solution to Faruzan's question can be calculated as: <code>2<sup>7</sup> - 1 = <b>127</b></code>

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Nadwah again at the Akademiya, optional)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 nadwah 01.ogg}} '''Nadwah:''' Archon be praised, I can finally send a report to my superiors! Thank you so much!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 nadwah 02.ogg}} '''Nadwah:''' I have no idea how we might have persuaded her otherwise...

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Nadwah, optional)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917301 nadwah 01.ogg}} '''Nadwah:''' (How did I end up getting myself into this...)

;(Go to Port Ormos and look for Anis)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 01.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Madam Faruzan...! It's really you! Did you... change your mind?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Alright, calm down. Let me be clear: I'm still not all that interested in Kshahrewar. I'm just here to see how the project is going.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' After all, you're here as representatives of the Akademiya in this collaboration. The reputation of all researchers is at stake here, so I will not simply stand by should mistakes get made.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 02.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Haha... Either way, it's good that you were willing to come.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 03.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Now, we've given Acara Crafts many ideas over the past couple of days. However, their owner thinks that our designs are too complicated, which will drive production costs too far up...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That's expected. Students who have never had to deal with budgetary constraints probably don't understand how important it is to keep costs low. How enviable... Ahem!
:{{DIcon}} By any chance, has it been very difficult for you...
:{{DIcon}} ...To get funding for your research?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 04.ogg}} '''Anis:''' If you join the Kshahrewar, your budget will be as big as you want it to be! I guarantee it.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That's enough. I will not repeat myself. Take me to Acara Crafts' owner first, if you please.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917202 anis 05.ogg}} '''Anis:''' *sigh* ...Alright. He's usually at the slope up ahead recruiting volunteers to test out his toys. Let's just head over.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Mamdouh, optional)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917301 mamdouh 01.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' (Surely the kids will like this one...?)

;(Talk to the staff at [[Acara Crafts]])
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 01.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Mamdouh, the one I recommended is here!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 01.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Oh, so you're... uh, Madam Faruzan?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Yes, that's me.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 02.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Ah, wonderful! We haven't been able to make any progress on our collaboration recently.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 03.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' We've made many suggestions, but Miss Anis thought that those ideas were too simple and wouldn't be effective in training the mind...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 02.ogg}} '''Anis:''' These early learning toys are meant to help the Akademiya train future researchers, after all. If they're too simple, then how are they any different from regular toys?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 04.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' But if they're too complicated, not only will they be expensive to produce considering our production capabilities, but they won't have much broad appeal to Sumeru's children, either.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' So the design can't be too complicated, but it can't be too easy to play with, either? Hmm...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 03.ogg}} '''Anis:''' I remember that, in your notes, many contraptions have managed to fulfill complex functions despite using simple parts. Maybe we can do something similar with these early learning toys...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' The contraptions in my notes? I didn't create those. I simply took the contraptions in the ruins apart and analyzed them.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' But now that you mention it, the ruins did have things like that. Do you have a pen, paper, and scissors? I'll make a paper prototype.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 05.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' You have an idea already? ... I suppose I should have expected as much of a respected Akademiya senior researcher. We do have those, yes. Please, help yourself!

:'''Faruzan starts to sketch and cut...'''

:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 06.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Oh, you're done already?
::[[File:Early Learning Mechanism Pagoda 1.png|300px]]
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 05.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Let me explain. These three thick lines represent three poles.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 06.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' These paper strips of varying lengths represent rings of different sizes. They can be slotted onto the poles and stacked up like a tower.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 07.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Well... That is easier to make than I expected. So, how is this game played?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That's very simple as well. You just need to shift the "tower" from this pole to another pole.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 04.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Um, isn't this a little too simple? Even by the standards of an early learning toy, I mean...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 08.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Of course, when moving each "ring," the paper strips in this case, you must follow one rule: You can only move one ring at a time, and you can't place a bigger ring on top of a smaller one.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 09.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' It's like building a tower. The rings in the three poles must be stacked from big to small. I name this toy... "Pagoda Stack."
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 05.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Hmm, Pagoda Stack...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 08.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' That sounds way too simple. Even I feel like it's missing something.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 10.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Give it a try and you'll find out if it's simple or not. I heard from Anis that you find volunteers to try out the toys, right? Why don't we do the same for this game?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 09.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' It's such a simple toy. There's no need to...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 06.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Mamdouh, let's just do as she says.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 10.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Huh? Okay then...

:'''Mamdouh gathers the nearby volunteers over, and Faruzan explains the rules to them...'''

:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 11.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' And that's how you play this game. You can all give it a try. Let's see who's able to move the "tower" to another pole in the smallest number of steps.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 01.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' You called everyone here for such a simple toy?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 01.ogg}} '''Alia:''' It doesn't look like it'll take that many steps...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 01.ogg}} '''Ruhi:''' Come on, we all promised to help Mr. Mamdouh test out the new toys. He said he'd give us new Genius Invokation TCG cards!
:{{DIcon}} So they were lured in by the promise of a different toy...
:{{DIcon}} So they were lured in by the promise of new cards...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 02.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' Ugh... fine. Let's get this over and done with so we can head back and play cards.

:'''The children start to play with Pagoda Stack...'''

:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 02.ogg}} '''Ruhi:''' ...Done. It took me 19 steps.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 02.ogg}} '''Alia:''' Huh? It took me over 20 steps!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 03.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' Hehe, I only needed 18 steps!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 12.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Not bad! Looks like you're all familiar with the rules now.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 13.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Then, let's increase the difficulty. The next "tower" will be five layers tall. Now then, give it a shot.
::[[File:Early Learning Mechanism Pagoda 2.png|300px]]
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 03.ogg}} '''Alia:''' Wait, there's more?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 04.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' Since we're already here, why don't we just give it a try?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 03.ogg}} '''Ruhi:''' An extra layer shouldn't make it that much harder, right?

:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 05.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' ...What's going on? I've already moved over 30 steps, but I'm still not done yet.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 04.ogg}} '''Alia:''' Hehe, I'm almost done. Looks like I'm the faster one this time.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 04.ogg}} '''Ruhi:''' Done! It took me 35 steps!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 06.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' What, how!?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 ruhi 05.ogg}} '''Ruhi:''' This "Pagoda Stack" toy is pretty fun to play with!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 14.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Good. We'll try it one final time. This time, we'll add two more layers, making seven layers in total.
::[[File:Early Learning Mechanism Pagoda 3.png|300px]]
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 15.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Mamdouh, we've still got quite a few paper strips here. Why don't you give this a go as well?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 11.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Do you need that many steps for something this simple? Let me try!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 07.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Madam Faruzan... allow me to try it as well!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 16.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' You were looking at it quite seriously just now. Are you starting to understand the principles involved?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 08.ogg}} '''Anis:''' I... think so?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 17.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' If you want to test out your hypothesis, you'll just have to play and find out!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 09.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Got it!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 18.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Ah. We don't have enough paper strips left for you, (Traveler). However, by the looks of things, you seem to have the game figured out.
:{{DIcon}} Somewhat.
:{{DIcon}} Just about.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 19.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Why don't you guess what the lowest number of steps needed to solve a seven-layer "Pagoda Stack" is?
:{{DIcon}} 100 steps.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 21.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' What a shame. You were close. However, you did well for someone seeing "Pagoda Stack" for the first time.
:{{DIcon}} 108 steps.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 21.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' What a shame. You were close. However, you did well for someone seeing "Pagoda Stack" for the first time.
:{{DIcon}} 127 steps.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 20.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Oh? Color me impressed. You figured it out so quickly!
:{{DIcon}} 136 steps.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 21.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' What a shame. You were close. However, you did well for someone seeing "Pagoda Stack" for the first time.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 22.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Let's see how well they do, then.

:'''After some time...'''

:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 12.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' If I move this small ring, then the big one won't be able to go on top of it. This is going to take more steps than I expected...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 07.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' I&mdash;I've lost count of how many steps I've taken! Can I restart?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 05.ogg}} '''Alia:''' This got a lot harder...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 10.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 11.ogg}} '''Anis:''' I solved it! Madam Faruzan, it takes 127 steps in total!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 13.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' That many? But there are only seven layers!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 12.ogg}} '''Anis:''' For every extra layer in the Pagoda Stack, the move order you need to consider becomes much more complex, and the number of steps required will at least double...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 23.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' More accurately, it will require double the steps, plus one each time. You did well. You didn't underestimate the "principles" behind it just because it's an early learning toy.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 24.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' The complexity of any given contraption isn't determined by the number of parts it has. The way the parts interact and the rules behind how it operates are important too.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 13.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Oh, I see. No wonder you emphasized in your notes that no contraption should ever be underestimated.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 14.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' I see. So even a simple toy can become complex with the right set of rules...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 25.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That's right. The rules used for "Pagoda Stack" are the simplest kind when it comes to ancient contraption-making techniques.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 26.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I could spend some time picking out all those machines that do something similar and write you a reference book.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 27.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Once that happens, you can give the volunteers the reference book and paper prototypes, and find out which toy is the most popular.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 alia 06.ogg}} '''Alia:''' Do you have any other toys?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 qasit 08.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' Yeah, when can we play with them?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 28.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Uh, in about two days or so, I think. Anis, if you're free, can you help me with the illustrations for the reference book?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 anis 14.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Of course! I'd be honored!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 15.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Two days should be enough for us to find more volunteers. Then, we can organize a huge conference here, at which we can announce which toy we'll be making.
:{{DIcon}} Should I come back in two days, then?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 mamdouh 16.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' You'd be most welcome! We need more people to get a healthy range of opinions. The more, the merrier!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917203 faruzan 29.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Thank you for coming here with me today. I'll walk back with you.

;(Talk to Mamdouh again)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 mamdouh 01.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' No wonder she's so well-respected at the Akademiya. When I first saw her, I thought she might be unreliable because she's so young...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 mamdouh 02.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Ah! Don't let her know I said that. Anis warned me about that before...

;(Talk to Anis again)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 anis 01.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Is Madam Faruzan really going to mentor me? What an honor!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 anis 02.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Ah, I'm sure she'll say "helping with illustrations isn't mentoring"... So, ah, don't tell her I said that.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Anis, optional)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917301 anis 01.ogg}} '''Anis:''' (Ah, if only Madam Faruzan were willing to switch to Kshahrewar... *sigh*)

;(Talk to Qasit, Ruhi, or Alia again)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 qasit 01.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' We need to wait two whole days before we get the new toys...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 ruhi 01.ogg}} '''Ruhi:''' It might just be all reference stuff. It'll be a loooong time before we can play with the real toys.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 alia 01.ogg}} '''Alia:''' Guess all we can do is play [[Genius Invokation TCG]] in the meantime...

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Anis, optional)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917301 alia 01.ogg}} '''Alia:''' (This new game's not bad, but Genius Invokation TCG is better...)

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Qasit, optional)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917301 qasit 01.ogg}} '''Qasit:''' (This new game's fun, like Genius Invokation TCG.)

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Ruhi, optional)
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917301 ruhi 01.ogg}} '''Ruhi:''' (This new game is even more fun than Genius Invokation TCG!)

{{Dialogue start}}
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I'll be going then. Say hi to Tighnari and Collei for me if you can. Once everything here is settled, I'll make my way over to Pardis Dhyai as quickly as I can.
:{{DIcon}} So, about Kshahrewar...
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' You want to ask why I'm unwilling to join them, yes?
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Putting aside the fact that they're too full of themselves, I actually have no issue with their research methodologies and approach.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' After all, knowledge is either right or wrong. Superiority and inferiority do not come into the conversation. All researchers are just doing their best to shed light on the unknown in their respective fields of expertise.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 05.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' No matter what corner of the unknown they shed light on, it's a step forward for us all.
::{{DIcon}} Then why do you refuse to join them?
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 06.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Because I believe wholeheartedly in that principle.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Even if others call my research "useless," as long as the knowledge I gain from it is accurate, it could become useful in the future.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 08.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' In the end, "useful" and "useless" are concepts that shouldn't be used to evaluate knowledge.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 09.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' When I first started deciphering ancient documents, I didn't think about how it'd be "useful" to Kshahrewar.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 10.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That's why there's no need for me to join them to do "useful" research. I'd rather stay in Haravatat. It's much more convenient for me to access the materials I need for my research here.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 11.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' *sigh* ... Still, the funding that Kshahrewar has offered me is so hard to get in Haravatat...
:{{DIcon}} Oh yeah, about Anis...
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 12.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Anis? We haven't had much time to get to know each other, but she seems like a good kid.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 13.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' She's able to calmly figure out the basic principles behind something without being influenced by others.
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 14.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I'll do my best to teach her over the next few days... Still, how much she learns will really depend on her.
::{{DIcon}} Why don't you take her on as your student?
::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 15.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Well, her interest lies in the application of mechanisms.

::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 17.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' My research into mechanisms is, in a sense, a side effect of my research into ancient texts.

::{{A|vo frzcop001 1917204 faruzan 23.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' You're right. Explanations are a core part of early development, too.

:{{DIcon}} I must apologize, too...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' No, you simply gave suggestions. I was the one who decided to follow through. Anis, too, was only following my instructions.

:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 05.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' Let me introduce myself. I'm Kamal, the Branch Master of Sumeru's Adventurers' Guild.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 03.ogg}} '''Anis:''' What's the Branch Master doing here? Were you looking for us, or did something happen?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 06.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' Ah, I came to Port Ormos to visit some old friends. On the way over, I saw the booklet you all were handing out, so I came to take a look.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 07.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' Can you print a few more copies of this booklet and sell them to the Adventurers' Guild? Also, could you make full-fledged models of those paper prototypes and sell them to us as well?

:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 08.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' You may see them as toys, but to adventurers who need to deal with all sorts of machines and contraptions within ancient ruins, this booklet is a true treasure!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 09.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' We have many members who can't read, so books are of little use to them. What they know of handling mechanisms has been learned solely through word-of-mouth.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 10.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' Even if the Akademiya granted public access to all their books, there are people who can't use them...

:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Well, it IS designed for children...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 11.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' It might be a bit too difficult for children, but it's perfect for adventurers. Also, those paper strips... Uh, you called them paper prototypes?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 12.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' If you can make wooden versions for demonstration purposes, even the most illiterate person would be able to follow along and understand.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 13.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' If we can supply a model set for each branch and if each adventurer carries a booklet with them, then ruin exploration will become much safer!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 faruzan 08.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Y&mdash;You really think so? *cough* I mean, yes, yes, I always knew it! Knowledge will always be needed one way or another!
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 mamdouh 06.ogg}} '''Mamdouh:''' Making models of contraptions for the Adventurers' Guild? To be honest, that sounds like a good avenue to explore to me.
:{{DIcon}} Will there be an issue with the Akademiya?
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 05.ogg}} '''Anis:''' Uh, we'll probably have to send in a separate application, but it shouldn't be an issue.
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 anis 06.ogg}} '''Anis:''' After all, this concerns safety during the exploration of ruins. It's a problem that the Akademiya is actually trying to address as well...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 14.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' Then let's cut to the chase and discuss the details of our first order. The amount we're offering to pay in advance is...
:{{A|vo frzcop001 1917205 kamal 15.ogg}} '''Kamal:''' ...This much.
