{{Description|With the end of the incident in [[Inazuma]], [[Kazuha]] follows [[The Crux]] and returns to [[Liyue]].<br>However, he has suddenly passed a short message along, requesting that his fellow sailors keep an eye out for you. Might he be in some sort of trouble...?}}
'''Tuned to the World's Sounds''' is a [[Rhythm Game]]-based event in [[Version 2.2]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
2021/10/15 10:00–2021/10/25 03:59

===Requirements===
*[[Adventure Rank]] 30 or above
* Complete [[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter II]]: Act III - [[Wishes (Quest)|Wishes]]

===Summary===
*During the event, after completing [[Kazuha]]'s special commission, [[Tuned to the World's Sounds (Quest)]], you can use the instrument given to you by Kazuha to play ensemble pieces together with other characters. Achieve a certain number of points to obtain the gadget "[[Floral Zither]]", [[Primogem]]s, and other rewards.
*Performances are split into Normal, Hard, and Pro difficulties. Normal difficulty is unlocked by default and subsequent difficulty levels can be unlocked by completing the previous difficulty with at least a "Euphonia" rating.
*Long notes have been introduced as a new mechanic to this event.

| You will be accompanied in your performance by a certain character. Different songs will correspond to different characters. You can view the songs and their corresponding characters through the Event Menu.

| During your performance, Rhythm Rings will appear on screen, and when the light circles around these Rhythm Rings shrinks down to accurate positions, you can press the Rhythm Rings to score points. Pressing consecutive Rhythm Rings correctly will award greater amounts of points.

| Sometimes, a long strip of light representing a long note will fall upon a Rhythm Ring, at which they should be held down until the light strip disappears, after which you will score points for this Rhythm Ring.
|}

===Notes===
* On PC (using mouse and keyboard), you can use your mouse to tap the notes, but because some notes are played simultaneously, a keyboard is also required.
* Bonus points are awarded for combos (consecutive notes played successfully):
::{| class="wikitable align-center"
|-
!Combo!!Multiplier
|-
|1-5||None
|-
|6-10||Points ×1.3
|-
|11-15||Points ×1.6
|-
|16+||Points ×2.0
|}
* Long notes may still be considered a success when releasing the note slightly earlier than the full duration. However, the full amount of points will not be rewarded.

==Songs==
There are a total of 7 songs, each with a different character as accompaniment.
