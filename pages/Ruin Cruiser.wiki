==Weak Point Location==
<gallery>
Ruin Cruiser Weak Point.png
</gallery>
* The Weak Point is only exposed while charging the '''Tri-Shot Blast''', '''Orb Lay''', and '''Stinger Bombardment''' attacks.

==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Tri-Shot Blast
|desc_1 = The three orbitals each charge an orb that is then shot from the main head, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} on hit. The core is exposed during this attack.

|name_2 = Stinger Shot
|desc_2 = Using the three orbitals as a scope, the main head fires a long and slender stinger that deals '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} on hit. While charging, it will protect its core.

|name_3 = Orb Lay
|desc_3 = By withdrawing its three orbitals and diverting all power to the head, it pushes itself back while also laying an energized orb. This attack is performed when the player is close to the Ruin Cruiser. The orb stays on the field for some time and deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to players that come in contact. It exposes its core during the charging of the orb.

|name_4 = Stinger Bombardment
|desc_4 = Mimicking the shape of a flower, the Ruin Cruiser fires multiple stingers into the air before they all bombard the area in front of it four times, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|AoE Physical DMG}} over a large area. Before bombarding, it fires a light beam at the player quickly that deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}. While charging, its core is exposed. When firing, its core is protected.

|name_5 = Deactivated
|desc_5 = When the weak spot of the main head is hit twice while it is exposed, the Ruin Cruiser deactivates for a short time where it does not attack back.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet both of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
* If multiple abilities meet both conditions, one will be chosen at random.
* Global CD is shared with all nearby [[Ruin Sentinels]].

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Various bizarrely-shaped machines that have taken different forms and functions to adapt to different goals.<br />Legend has it that they are war machines left behind by a nation that has already been destroyed. Compared to the more common [[Ruin Guard]]s, their design has greater value in the study of biomimesis. The inspiration for its decentralized design and combat modes seem to have come from honeybee colonies, rendering it able to change forms and to attack from different directions.|[[Archive]]}}
