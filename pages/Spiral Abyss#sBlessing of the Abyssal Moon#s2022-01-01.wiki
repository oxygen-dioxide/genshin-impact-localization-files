<li>When a character deals Elemental DMG to opponents with a Normal ATK, Charged ATK, Plunging ATK, Elemental Skill, or Elemental Burst, all party members gain 10% Bonus DMG for that element, and will gain 10% more Bonus DMG every 3s until they obtain 100% Bonus Elemental DMG through this Blessing of the Abyssal Moon. When a character deals a different type of Elemental DMG to an opponent this way, the previous Elemental DMG Bonus gained will reset.</li>
