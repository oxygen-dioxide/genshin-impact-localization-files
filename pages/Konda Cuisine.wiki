|desc_suspicious = If the fowl that had not been fried beforehand could still barely be tolerated, the un-boiled lavender melon truly makes this a culinary disaster. Not only is the taste astringent, but the mix even stains your tongue to the point where someone else might think that you were being poisoned.
|desc_basic      = Everyone in [[Konda Village]] knows how to make this dish. It originally had no name but would spread throughout Inazuma on account of its nutritious deliciousness. This eventually caused those from outside the village to give it its name &mdash; "Konda Cuisine."
|desc_delicious  = Well-honed temperature control has allowed every ingredient to be cooked just right. This is it - the exact same aroma that you smell, simple yet surpassing many delicacies, when you take a stroll through Konda Village at night. Surely a village local roaming abroad would begin to miss home if they were to eat this dish so made by you.
