|description  = A traditional instrument from [[Natlan]] that can be used in performances.<br>A small, four-stringed lute shaped similarly to — and which plays like — a guitar, though its fret count and tuning differ. Thanks to the material the strings are made of, it sounds clear and bright, yet soft, soothing the hearts of those who hear it.
