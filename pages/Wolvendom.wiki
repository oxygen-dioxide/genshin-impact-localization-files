==Trivia==
*All four major languages (supported in Genshin Impact) use a name that either sounds archaic or gives a European atmosphere.
** The English name consists of the archaic adjective ''{{wt|wolven}}'' ("wolf's") and the suffix ''{{wt|-dom#English|-dom}}'' ("jurisdiction"), whose usage is archaic in this sense. The translation "Wolvendom" is perhaps influenced by Elvendom, the domain of elves in {{w|J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien}}'s novels.
** The name in the original Chinese version {{Lang|Bēnláng-lǐng|zh=奔狼领}} means the "Fiefdom of Running Wolves." However, the hanzi {{Lang|mini=1|zh=领}} as a suffix in this sense is relatively rare in Mandarin and limited to European fiefdoms such as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=伯爵领}} ("county" in Europe, but not in ancient China).<ref group="Note">See the discussion [https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=23706672 NGA.CN: 破事氵 奔狼领的领字，为什么不用岭？] (CN) for details.</ref> Therefore, the term offers the atmosphere of medieval and early modern Europe and gives an impression that its ruler [[Andrius]] is a European noble lord, not just the leader of a pack of wolves.
**The Japanese version uses the name "{{Lang|mini=1|ja=奔狼領}}," the direct hanzi-to-kanji conversion, which has the same sense as the Chinese name. Unlike Mandarin, however, the suffix {{Lang|mini=1|ja=-領}} ("domain" or "fief") is very common in Japanese and has no specific connotation. Meanwhile, the usage of {{Lang|mini=1|ja=奔}} ("to run") is relatively rare compared with Mandarin; therefore, the name gives an archaic or literary atmosphere overall.
**The Korean name {{Lang|mini=1|ko=울프 영지}} means "''Ulpeu'' Fiefdom," where ''Ulpeu'' is a transcription of the English noun ''wolf'' or the German noun ''Ulf'' ("wolf"), thereby giving a European atmosphere.
* If the player enters combat with an enemy at the [[Wolf of the North Challenge]] arena, an [https://youtu.be/xTlOpeZhHGY untitled battle theme] will play (does not play while in combat with [[Andrius]]). This soundtrack apparently was intended to be featured in the Archon Quest "[[Dishonorable Trial]]" while fighting the [[Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents|Abyss Herald]] at the arena.
** The soundtrack shares a motif with "[[Make Haste, Partner]]."
* As of Version 2.4, Rifthounds can now be encountered around the Wolvendom area, as first hinted by Razor's quest: [[The Meaning of Lupical]].
