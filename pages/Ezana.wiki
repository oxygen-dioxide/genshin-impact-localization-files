:'''Ezana:''' Welcome.
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Ezana:''' Here, we sell masks in the styles of all the different tribes. Let me know if you see anything you like the look of.
::'''Ezana:''' In the extremely unlikely event that none of our pre-made masks take your fancy, we also have materials for you to make your own.
::'''Ezana:''' If you make one yourself, you'll only be charged the cost of the materials.
::{{DIcon}} When do you usually wear a mask?
:::'''Ezana:''' You can wear a mask whenever you feel like it.
:::'''Ezana:''' But normally, you'll see more people wearing them on holidays.
:::'''Ezana:''' Also, when there's a competition, many people wear the masks of the tribe they support as a way of cheering on their warriors.
:::'''Ezana:''' But normally, you can just wear it as a fancy accessory.
::{{DIcon}} I'd like a Flying Lavender Melon mask, then.
:::'''Ezana:''' ...Huh? What's that?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ezana:''' Goodbye.
