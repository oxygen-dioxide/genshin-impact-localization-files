|text    = This year's fruit harvest is superior to previous ones on every front. I wanted you to experience the fine flavor at the first opportunity, so I have mailed you the choicest [[Apple Cider]]. You will find it enclosed.

I trust that your travels are going smoothly? You will undoubtedly encounter the unexpected from time to time, where the most important strength is knowing how to adapt, with having a capable assistant as the second.

I have seen how you handle things &mdash; quite simply, it's remarkable... Thus I need not worry about how you are faring.

You have many admirable qualities. In particular, your ability to unite people is awe-inspiring. These days, I often find myself drawing lessons from you when reflecting on myself. This is a novel experience for me, but also an enjoyable one.

I am forced to conclude that I must proceed forward with greater determination.

Though we may not share the same end goals, our paths are intertwined nonetheless. Thus, I shall join you on your journey.
