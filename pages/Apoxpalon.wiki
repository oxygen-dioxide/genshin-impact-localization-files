''Available before completing [[The Rainbow Destined to Burn]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Apoxpalon:''' Things in this world are often a mixture of fortune and woes.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Apoxpalon knows)
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' A few of my regulars have been kind enough to mention seeing some [[Condessence Crystal]]s nearby, and quite a bit of Magical Crystal Ore to boot.
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' I'm still nowhere near to running out myself though, so I thought I'd just leave them for someone else who needed them more than I did. They're probably around about... here. If you could use them, go check it out.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Apoxpalon knows)
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' Sorry, I only really pay attention to what's going on with the customers who come to me for weapons, and that's not something I'm at liberty to share with you.
:{{DIcon}} And why do you say that?
::'''Apoxpalon:''' Let me give you a practical example. Say that on a certain date, a long time ago, ta-da! You were born into the Children of Echoes.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' Good news &mdash; the lands of the tribe are rich in valued minerals. Everyone can make a living by mining stones. Between making jewelry, forging weapons, and conducting business with other peoples, there's tons of fun to be had.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' The bad news, of course, is that this land also produces nothing but stones. If you want anything else, you'll have to trade for it... using stones.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' What do you think? Simple and easy to understand, right?
::{{DIcon}} Indeed it does.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' Yep, that's exactly how it is. My work is like that, too.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' Good news &mdash; I am quite skilled at making weapons. Not only can I produce enough for the people of my tribe, I can also trade my products with the other tribes for goods.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' The bad news, of course, is that I am absolutely useless when it comes to cutting gems and making jewelry.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' Anyway, so I've also presented both good and bad news to my clients. The good news: the quality of my equipment is always guaranteed!
::'''Apoxpalon:''' The bad news: No haggling!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' See you! This rule also applies to meetings and farewells!

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing The Rainbow Destined to Burn''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Apoxpalon:''' Things in this world are often a mixture of fortune and woes.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} And why do you say that?
::'''Apoxpalon:''' Let me give you a practical example. Say that on a certain date, a long time ago, ta-da! You were born into the Children of Echoes.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' Good news &mdash; the lands of the tribe are rich in valued minerals. Everyone can make a living by mining stones. Between making jewelry, forging weapons, and conducting business with other peoples, there's tons of fun to be had.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' The bad news, of course, is that this land also produces nothing but stones. If you want anything else, you'll have to trade for it... using stones.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' What do you think? Simple and easy to understand, right?
::{{DIcon}} That's for sure.
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' Yep, that's exactly how it is. My work is like that, too.
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' The bad news, of course, is that I am absolutely useless when it comes to cutting gems and making jewelry!
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' But the good news &mdash; the best of all in fact &mdash; is that I have quite the knack for making weapons!
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' As you know, the [[Abyss]] is a tough adversary indeed. I only hope that my weapons can be used to deliver a mighty blow against it.
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' Of course, it would be even better if they could bring their own owners back with them... *sigh*...
:::'''Apoxpalon:''' Do you know [[Batz]]? That hothead... Rushed off brandishing a sword he'd barely used to save a [[Saurian]] trapped in a mine, and we haven't heard a word from him since...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Apoxpalon:''' See you! This rule also applies to meetings and farewells!
