==Descriptions==
{{Description|This plant is named after the giant grains that grow along the cob.<br>Legend has it that there was a period in ancient times when the tribesfolk faced a desperate plight. The earth refused to accept their seeds, and as such, they could not obtain food from the land. At that time the priest [[Maghan]] heeded the guidance of the night spirits, who told him to dredge up silt from the riverbed and plant animal teeth within it. He then stood in the silt, cut himself, and watered the crop with his own blood. The result was that the teeth sprouted and began to grow upwards, using the priest's body as support, finally transforming into the plant we now call Grainfruit.<br>According to a tradition of ancient origin, the shaft of the Grainfruit plant must never be casually disposed of, for it is believed to be the physical transformation and embodiment of Maghan's self-sacrifice.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Grainfruit leaves can be used to make very comfortable pillows.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Varesa|Good Night}}</ref>
