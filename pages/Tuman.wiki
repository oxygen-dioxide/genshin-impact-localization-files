:'''Tuman:''' Chin up! For Rukkhadivine Mushrooms...
:{{DIcon}} Rukkha... divine?
::'''Tuman:''' Ahem, yes, those huge mushrooms on the trees. Everyone's seen them.
::'''Tuman:''' Huh? They're called [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]]?
::'''Tuman:''' Fine, if you say so. It doesn't make a difference to me, it's still some divine thingy I can sell.
::{{DIcon}} Sell?
:;(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Tuman:''' Yeah, don't you know? These huge mushrooms that grow in the rainforest can be sold for quite a bit in the city.
:::'''Tuman:''' Seems like the [[Akademiya]]'s always in need of a huge amount of these great mushrooms, so they probably wouldn't mind a nobody like me making a little money, right?
:::'''Tuman:''' Anyway, my plan to resell &mdash; I mean, my plan to sell these mushrooms is perfect, but there's just one problem, The Withering.
:::'''Tuman:''' *sigh* How strong must my desire to sell mushrooms be in order to get a [[Vision]]?
:::'''Tuman:''' Dealing with [[The Withering]] will be a piece of cake once I have a Vision.
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Tuman:''' Yeah, don't you know? These huge mushrooms that grow in the rainforest can be sold for quite a good sum in the city.
:::'''Tuman:''' Seems like the Akademiya's always in need of a huge amount of these great mushrooms, so they probably wouldn't mind if a nobody made a little sum off 'em, right?
:::'''Tuman:''' Anyway, my plan to resell&mdash; I mean, my plan to sell these mushrooms is perfect! There's just one problem, though. The Withering.
:::'''Tuman:''' Wait, what? The Withering isn't cropping up everywhere anymore? But I've heard that it's still out there in the forest... you aren't trying to trick me, are you?
:::'''Tuman:''' *sigh* Do you know how strong my desire to sell mushrooms must be in order to land a Vision?
:::'''Tuman:''' The Withering would be a piece of cake if I had one of those.
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Tuman:''' Good luck! Oh, I meant for myself...
