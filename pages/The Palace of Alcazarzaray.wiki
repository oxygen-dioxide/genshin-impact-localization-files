{{Location Intro|description=<p>The Palace of Alcazarzaray is currently owned by [[Dori]]. It was designed by [[Kaveh]] and is considered to be his magnum opus.</p>}}

The project had given Kaveh near complete creative freedom over the palace, with Dori only stating that it should be "large and extravagant," so the architect committed himself fully to it, being able to work without restrictions. However, near the completion of the project, [[The Withering]] had expanded in the night, destroying the worksite and leaving it beyond saving. Dori did not want to continue the project, but Kaveh had already invested too much into the project, knowing how rare an opportunity like this was. After much contemplation, he decided to take out a loan with Dori, and the palace was rebuilt, leaving Kaveh in massive debt.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaveh|4}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* An ''{{w|alcázar}}'' is a type of Islamic palace built in the {{w|al-Andalus}} region. {{es|Alcázar}} is a Spanish word derived from the Arabic {{lang|mini=1|ar=القصر|ar_rm=al-qaṣr}}, meaning "the fort" or "the palace," which itself is derived from the Latin word {{lang|mini=1|la=''castrum''}}, meaning "fortress" or "military camp."
* The derivation of ''-zaray'' is unclear, with multiple possibilities:
** The Arabic word {{lang|mini=1|ar={{wt|زرع|زَرَعَ|Pronunciation_1}}|ar_rm=zaraʿa}} means "planting" or "sowing," and its adjective form is {{lang|mini=1|ar=زَرْعَيْ|ar_rm=zaray}}. Combined with ''alcázar'', or ''al-qasr'', it would mean "Planting/Sowing Palace."
** The Persian word {{lang|mini=1|fa={{wt|سرای||Persian}}|fa_rm=sarây}} means "palace."
** The Avestan word "zaray" means "yellow," "golden," or "golden shine" and is used to form the first part of the name {{w|Zarathustra}}, another name for {{w|Zoraster}}.<ref>Google Books: [https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Faith_philosophy_of_Zoroastrianism/4lNPn6kQEAcC?gbpv=1&dq=zaray&pg=PA14 Faith & Philosophy of Zoroastrianism]</ref><ref>Google Books: [https://www.google.ca/books/edition/From_the_Mysteries/hvvoDwAAQBAJ?gbpv=1&pg=PA148 From the Mysteries]</ref>
* The Chinese and Korean names are phonetic transcriptions of "cazarzaray."
