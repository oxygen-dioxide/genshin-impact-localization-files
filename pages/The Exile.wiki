==Gameplay Notes==
*4-Piece Bonus:
**The 4-Piece Bonus is '''not affected''' by Energy Recharge.
**Energy regeneration doesn't start immediately, but after 2s, and ticks every 2s for 3 times.
**Characters that have longer Energy consumption frames may not receive the first Energy regeneration tick.
