|description    = A small settlement that strives to recreate the scenery of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], with buildings laid out to resemble the crest of an [[Iktomisaurus]].<br>To the eyes of outsiders, the Masters of the Night-Wind are a mysterious and inscrutable tribe, and most assume their shamans to be eccentric and hard to approach &mdash; not without good reason, for the environs which the Masters of the Night-Wind inhabit are not somewhere that those of a more conventional disposition would thrive.<br>Eccentricity aside, these shamans excel at tending to themselves &mdash; in addition to their festivals. How else would they be able to meditate in comfort all day long?
