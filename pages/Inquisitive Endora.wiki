The '''Inquisitive Endora''' is a limited time [[Gadget]] obtained from the [[Wishful Drops]] Event. It is used to capture [[Hydro Mimics|Oceanid Creatures]] when exploring during '''Endora's Education'''. It expires on 2021/04/16 04:00.

==Endora's Educational Notes==
Endora's Educational Notes are expanded and completed by capturing mer-creatures in the [[Wishful Drops]] event.

{{Quote|Want to grow quickly. Want to find Rhodeia.<br><br>A child. New life, like Endora. A child's mission is to grow. To grow? I thought it was to see the world.<br><br>Love. For Oceanids, this is to meld together as one. There will be no division then. That is why Oceanids need no learning or thoughts of their own. All that is needed is love.<br><br>It seems that Oceanids cannot love others, for others will only drown in the embrace of pure waters. So they disguise themselves as the dreams of young children, and withdraw from the lives of all other people.<br><br>Every day, a child takes a stumbling step forward. Every day, a stream flows into the sea.<br><br>Love, that is our destiny. But I still have a whole world left to see.|Endora}}

==Trivia==
*Inquisitive Endora can also be used to restrain small [[enemies]] like [[hilichurls]] and [[slimes]]. However, these other creatures cannot be captured like the [[Hydro Mimics]] can.
*This item combines [[Special Bottle]] with [[Endora]], thus the icon is similar to [[Holy Water]].
