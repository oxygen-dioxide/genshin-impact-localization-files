==Profile==
Olaf is a Springvale villager that has been frozen for the past 300 years by a [[Cryo Regisvine]] after chasing a boar into an underground ruin. The [[Traveler]] and [[Xiangling]] run into Olaf while looking for fresh ingredients, who was recently unfrozen. They give him hot soup to warm him up, and he returns to Springvale where he tries to get used to life in the future.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Olaf:''' Life in the future is hard to get used to...
:{{DIcon}} How do you get on with your modern family?
::'''Olaf:''' Well, I have skipped over so many centuries that try as we might, [[Draff]] and I cannot figure out where exactly I fit in the family tree, and therefore how we should address one another.
::'''Olaf:''' So we just gave up and started using first names instead. You have got to overlook some things when you are in a strange situation like this, do you not think?
::'''Olaf:''' Being related by blood does seem to give us an inexplicable connection though. Draff and I are complete strangers, and yet we keep finding that we just have so much in common.
::'''Olaf:''' ...Especially when it comes to drinking. It comforts me to know that hundreds of years on, Mondstadt still has such excellent taste in alcohol.
::'''Olaf:''' But every time we start talking about it, his little girl [[Diona]] gives me this dirty look that really makes her great-great-great... I don't know how many greats it is but anyway, it really makes her Grandad of indeterminate greathood feel... greatly aggrieved.
:{{DIcon}} What was Springvale like in your day?
::'''Olaf:''' You mean, the age I lived in before my accidental cryopreservation?
::'''Olaf:''' This spring was formed from melted snow and ice that came down from [[Dragonspine]]. I heard that Springvale originally began as just a group of hunters like me who settled in this area because of the water source.
::'''Olaf:''' Over time, it gradually grew to the size of a small town. I certainly do not believe this nonsense you future folk trot out about some [[Spring Fairy|fountain fairy]].
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Olaf:''' Back to the hunt for you, is it? May it be a fruitful one.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Of Ballads and Brews===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Olaf:''' Traveler! It's you! Welcome to Mondstadt's Weinlesefest.
:'''Olaf:''' I really miss it... Although there seem to be few people brewing the "Thousand-Wind Wine" now, the return of the west wind is still so familiar...
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* [[Draff]] and Olaf are unable to figure out where he exactly fits in the family tree, so they gave up and just call each other by their first names.
