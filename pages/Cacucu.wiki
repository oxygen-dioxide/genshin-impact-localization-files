'''Cacucu''' is [[Ifa]]'s [[Saurian]] companion and self-proclaimed "brother."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kotimy}}</ref>

He is summoned into battle through Ifa's [[Elemental Skill]], [[Airborne Disease Prevention]], and allows Ifa to enter a flying mode similar to a [[Qucusaurus]].

He makes his first appearance in {{Quest|After the Peace}}.

==Profile==
Cacucu is a cheerful, energetic [[Qucusaurus]]. He assists at Ifa's clinic and is capable of understanding and mimicking human speech. Due to the limits of his vocal cords, he can only communicate by repeating catchphrases he learned from Ifa:

:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 09.ogg}} Hahaha!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 02.ogg}} No way, bro!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 01.ogg}} Nuh-uh!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 03.ogg}} Oh dear! Oh dear!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 06.ogg}} Oh wow... No way, bro!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 12.ogg}} See you later!
:{{A|vo mwklq001 5 cacucu 04.ogg}} The heck are you on about?
{{Dialogue End}}

However, like other Saurian NPCs, Cacucu is capable of fluent communication with the [[Traveler]] when the latter [[Saurian Indwelling|indwells a Saurian]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|After the Peace}}</ref>

In the past, Cacucu was bullied by other Saurians due to his unusual appearance and was in poor condition when Ifa found him. Ifa nursed him back to health, and Cacucu began following Ifa. When they were treating a sick saurian, Cacucu also became infected and ran a high fever. Though Ifa gave it his all, Cacucu nearly died, but managed to recover from his illness and continued following him.<ref name="unity">{{Ref/Quest|Spell of Unity}}</ref>
