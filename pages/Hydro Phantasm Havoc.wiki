# Defeat the Tainted Hydro Phantasms

==Request Details==
{{Quest Description|Tainted Hydro Phantasms are causing trouble...}}
===Request from Lectoure===
"Tales of Humanity":<br><!--
-->You get used to seeing weird stuff after spending too long in the harbor.<br><!--
-->But for travelers from other lands, it must all be a bit much &mdash; crabs that can take off a thumb before you've had time to blink, giant working robots, and even the water itself seems bent on attacking people.<br><!--
-->In fact, a traveler from Liyue on our ship has been scared so silly by what he calls "water that attacks people" that he now refuses to leave the ship no matter what.<br><!--
-->Would someone please look into this? He's insistent that he won't set foot on land again until the problem's been dealt with, and we can't set sail until he's done so...
