'''Leonard''' was an adventurer who lived approximately 2,600 years ago,<ref group="Note">While Mona only says "two thousand years ago," he must have lived around 2600 years ago, before [[Decarabian]]'s fall and [[Barbatos]]' ascension to the position of Anemo Archon. After Barbatos became the Anemo Archon, he reshaped Mondstadt and in the process, turned Pilos Peak into the modern-day Musk Reef; for Leonard to attempt to climb Pilos Peak means he had to have done so before Barbatos ascended. He also personally knew [[Venerare]], the leader of the Lawrence Clan at the time Barbatos became the Anemo Archon, which indicates they were contemporaries.</ref> as well as the designer and inventor of the [[Wind Glider]].<ref name="US4">{{Ref/Quest|Where Ancient Stars Align}}</ref> Leonard and his legacy are the driving force behind the meteorites in the [[Unreconciled Stars]] event.

==Profile==
Leonard's lifelong dream was to reach the summit of a mountain called [[Musk Reef|Pilos Peak]], and his journal, "[[Of Mountains and Seas]]," was written on his attempt to conquer it.<ref name="US4" /> The strength of his will was so strong, some two thousand years later, it induced the meteorite showers during [[Unreconciled Stars]] that sent those who touched it into a deep slumber, where they dreamt of ascending the mountain. Those trapped in the dream felt compelled to climb it, as though possessed.

He somehow knew [[Venerare]] of the [[Lawrence Clan]], who supported his efforts to climb Pilos Peak in some way.<ref>{{Ref/Book|"Of Mountains and Seas"|q=Thanks to help from Venerare and... I was finally able to get across... and make it to this mountain peak...}}</ref>
