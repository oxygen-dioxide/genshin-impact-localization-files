==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Daniaud:''' I never expected that so many strange objects could be fished out of the water before I first learned to fish...
:{{DIcon}} Mind telling me about your fishing history?
::'''Daniaud:''' A friend introduced the hobby to me. At first, I thought it to be quite boring &mdash; I mean, what else could you call an activity that tests one's patience?
::'''Daniaud:''' But my friend just waved his hand in a mysterious way, claiming that fishing itself could not encompass the whole hobby.
::'''Daniaud:''' Just as reading a book could open you to other experiences beyond its contents, he said.
::'''Daniaud:''' For example, one might consider and analyze the story's backdrop, listen to comments from other readers, view other work derived from the text, and so on.
::'''Daniaud:''' And the truth has borne his statement out quite nicely, I feel. The simple thought of what I might fish up this time is already very fascinating to me.
:{{DIcon}} About the strange objects you spoke of...
::'''Daniaud:''' Fishermen often say that "fishermen can catch anything &mdash; just not fish."
::'''Daniaud:''' I thought that was just a joke, to be honest, but as it turns out, there really is such a [[Kayvan|person in Sumeru]] &mdash; no matter what water body he goes to, what bait or equipment he uses, he always catches... Well, not fish!
::'''Daniaud:''' What an enviable ability! I thought that simply being able to catch clockwork fish here in Fontaine was already quite amazing!
::'''Daniaud:''' If the things we catch define a fisherman's world, then his world truly is vibrant and full of life.
::'''Daniaud:''' *sigh* Enough talk. I should do my best as well!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Good luck.
::'''Daniaud:''' Thank you! I am still new to this, so I only managed to fish out some plants.
::'''Daniaud:''' Uh... But someone told me that algae are not actually plants...
::'''Daniaud:''' I don't know much about that. They are not of much importance to me anyway. If you don't mind, you can take these.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Tidalga|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Daniaud:''' See you. Ah, I look forward to today's catch!
