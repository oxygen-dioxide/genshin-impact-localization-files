::'''Vanita:''' Hello.
::'''Vanita:''' ...
::'''Vanita:''' Sorry, my colleagues and I are not good at small talk. It's easy to get distracted by talking after all.
::'''Vanita:''' This is the [[Wikala Funduq]]. Many people come here to do business every day. Interest rates can incite disputes, so this place must be strictly guarded.
::'''Vanita:''' Oh, right, I must also remind you that if you are new to the city, it's best not to trust those who wear the uniform of [[the Eremites]].
::'''Vanita:''' Especially those who peddle dangerous goods related to obtaining knowledge. They are driven by money and are not afraid to cross the lines considered unforgivable by the Akademiya.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Vanita:''' See you.
