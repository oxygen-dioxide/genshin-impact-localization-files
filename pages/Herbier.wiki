===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing [[Masquerade of the Guilty]])
:'''Herbier:''' No two cases are alike. The details guide the story.
:{{DIcon}} And how would you differentiate them?
::'''Herbier:''' Well, we'd need to analyze each case in detail, but I do have a personal "prescription."
::'''Herbier:''' If Lady [[Furina]] comes personally and looks excited, then the case itself might not be important, but there must be something incredible about it all the same.
::'''Herbier:''' ...Though even if there is no such thing, she will whip up drama of her own accord.
::'''Herbier:''' And if the [[Neuvillette|Chief Justice]] personally presides over the trial, then it's almost certainly worth paying attention &mdash; it will certainly be more newsworthy, that's for sure.
::'''Herbier:''' But such cases aren't very easy to report on. In fact, some of them involve information blackouts.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Herbier:''' See you.

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing [[Masquerade of the Guilty]])
:'''Herbier:''' No two cases are alike. The details guide the story.
:{{DIcon}} And how would you differentiate them?
::'''Herbier:''' Well, we'd need to analyze each case in detail, but I've always had a personal "prescription."
::'''Herbier:''' If Lady Furina comes personally and looks excited, then there will be something incredible about the case, even if it isn't an important one.
::'''Herbier:''' ...Even if there's nothing special about the case, Lady Furina can create drama herself.
::'''Herbier:''' And if the Chief Justice personally presides over the trial, it'll most likely be worth paying attention to. Certainly more newsworthy, at any rate.
::'''Herbier:''' But such cases aren't very easy to report on. In fact, some of them involve information blackouts.
::'''Herbier:''' But now... it seems like only half the "prescription" is applicable.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Herbier:''' See you.
