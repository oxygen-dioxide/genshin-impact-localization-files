'''Flash-Fried Filet''' is a [[:Category:Special Dishes|special]] [[food]] item that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Stir-Fried Filet]] with [[Beidou]]. The [[recipe]] for Stir-Fried Filet is obtainable somewhere in [[Mingyun Village]].

Flash-Fried Filet revives a character and restores '''10'''% of Max HP, then restores an additional '''150''' HP to the target fallen character with a 120-second cooldown. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].
