==Profile==
According to accounts heard by [[Delaroche]], Lescot was only 8 years old when he tied a bunch of heavy seashells to his body and walked into the water, never to return again. This occurred a month before the events of [[Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures]]. His family took on the name after moving into the city as they originated from a place called Destree. His father passed away in an accident years prior.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Miraculous Crown (Quest)}}</ref>
