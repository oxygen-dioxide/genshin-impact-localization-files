==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ulfr:''' *grunt* What do you want? Are you here to jeer and ridicule me too?
:{{DIcon}} ...Whoa, I haven't said anything yet...
::'''Ulfr:''' Well, what is it then? I highly doubt you're here to help me build my boat.
::'''Ulfr:''' Anyway, whatever it is I'm not in the mood for it now. *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} ...You're building a boat?
::'''Ulfr:''' Yes. Just a little one, so me and [[Flora]] can go boating on the lake.
::'''Ulfr:''' I thought that with Flora being so light and dainty, no boat would be fit for her unless I got rid of the keel, which is heavy and unwieldy.
::'''Ulfr:''' I also figured I'd build the hull from her favorite thing in the world &mdash; dandelions!
::'''Ulfr:''' ...What? You want to see the boat?
::'''Ulfr:''' My first attempt is on the lake bed over there, and the second one is on the lake bed right here.
::'''Ulfr:''' I just don't understand why they won't float.
::{{DIcon}} So, about Flora...
:::'''Ulfr:''' You must want to know why I'm so nice to Flora?
:::'''Ulfr:''' Well... it's like this. My parents separated when I was very young, and I spent much of my childhood on my own.
:::'''Ulfr:''' I sometimes imagined what it would be like to have a sibling, and the way I imagined them is exactly how Flora is: light-hearted, bubbly, and carefree...
:::'''Ulfr:''' So, I just want to treat her like I would my own sibling, you know, do nice things for her.
:::'''Ulfr:''' It sounds stupid, I know, but I always wanted to go boating together as a family. My old man practically laughs till he cries whenever I mention it to him, though... Tsk, that old cynic...
:::'''Ulfr:''' But, I'm sure that Flora wouldn't laugh at me like that.
:::{{DIcon}} Hehe, uh-huh! You're probably right.
::::'''Ulfr:''' Hey, don't do impressions of Flora! That's disrespectful!
:::{{DIcon}} Seems mildly self-indulgent of you.
::::'''Ulfr:''' Right, exactly...
::::'''Ulfr:''' Wait, what? Self-indulgent? No, no, it's not like that!
::::'''Ulfr:''' You have to have some degree of admiration for your own goals, don't you? Otherwise, why would you pursue them?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} ...Good luck to you.
:::'''Ulfr:''' Someday, I'll invite Flora to board a dandelion boat that I made myself... It's just a shame that they keep sinking.
:::'''Ulfr:''' ...But every cloud has a silver lining. My swimming ability has improved greatly as a result!
:::'''Ulfr:''' Last time, I even had several crabs grab onto my eyelids. But I still managed to swim back to shore, even though I couldn't see.
:::'''Ulfr:''' Oh, and several more ended up in my pockets too... Here, you can have them. Now, I have a boat to build!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Crab|x=5}})
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it...
::'''Ulfr:''' Hmph. Bye.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* In his old dialogue, Ulfr wished to confess his love to Flora on board a dandelion boat one day. This was most likely due to Flora initially using an adult NPC model in the [[Closed Beta Test]] version of the game.
