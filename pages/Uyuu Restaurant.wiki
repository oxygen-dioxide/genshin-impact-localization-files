{{Dialogue Start}}

==Trivia==
* The restaurant was first mentioned in [[Someone's Drifting Bottle]], which was implemented into the game in [[Version 1.2]], five [[Version]]s prior to its release.
* Okazaki Rikuto may be the adoptive father of, or at least somehow related to, [[Okazaki Kunihiko]] and [[Okazaki Toraemon]], two [[Iwakura Art]] practitioners whom the [[Traveler]] can potentially kill while exploring Inazuma. They share the same surname, {{Lang|Okazaki|ja=岡崎}}.

===Etymology===
* ''Uyuu'' comes from the Chinese word {{zh|乌有|Wūyǒu|nonexistence|not-have,}} which in turn comes from the name of a fictional character in the ancient Chinese ''fu'' (rhapsody) called {{Lang|Zixu Fu|zh=子虚赋}}. {{Lang|Zixu|zh=子虚}}, which is also the name of the main character, means "nonexistent thing."
