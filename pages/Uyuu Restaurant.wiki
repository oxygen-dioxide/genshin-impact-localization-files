The bulletin board can be found next to the restaurant.

==Trivia==
*The restaurant was first mentioned in [[Someone's Drifting Bottle]], which was implemented into the game five patches earlier in [[Version/1.2|Version 1.2]].
*Okazaki Rikuto may be the adoptive father of, or at least somehow related to, [[Okazaki Kunihiko]] and [[Okazaki Toraemon]], two [[Iwakura Art]] practitioners whom the [[Traveler]] can potentially kill while exploring Inazuma. They share the same surname, {{Lang|Okazaki|ja=岡崎}}.

===Etymology===
*''Uyuu'' comes from the Chinese word {{Lang|mini=1|zh=乌有|zh_rm=Wūyǒu|zh_tl=nonexistence," lit. "not-have}}, which in turn comes from the name of a fictional character in the ancient Chinese ''fu'' (rhapsody) called {{Lang|Zixu Fu|zh=子虚赋}}. {{Lang|Zixu|zh=子虚}}, which is also the name of the main character, means "nonexistent thing."
