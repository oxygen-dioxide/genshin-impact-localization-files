'''Cutting Torrent''' is [[Tartaglia]]'s [[Normal Attack]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|Riptide Flash|1}}
** This particle generation has a cooldown of 3 seconds. This cooldown is shared with the [[Riptide Slash]] particle generation.
* [[Normal Attack]] bonuses from artifacts or weapons affect the damage of Riptide Flash and Riptide Burst.
* Riptide Flash is not affected by damage fall off due to being not a part of the Fully Charged Aimed Shot.
* If an attack that would apply Riptide (e.g., Fully Charged Aimed Shot, Riptide Burst, 4th ascension passive Swords of Torrent triggering, and Havoc: Obliteration Ranged Stance version) to an enemy who is not affected by Riptide, would deal enough damage to kill it, Riptide will still be applied, causing Riptide Burst to trigger immediately.
