For different people, fireworks represent different things, like friendship, marriage, beliefs. As Yoimiya noticed, people tend to associate fireworks with things precious to them.<ref name="yoimiya quest act 1 part 4" />

==History==
{{Quote|The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.|Old Inazuman folksong|{{Ref/CS|Yoimiya|5}}}}
The Naganohara Fireworks Show first began over a century ago with a commemorative show set up by the [[Yashiro Commission]], with fireworks created by the most expert pyrotechnicians. The show began to occur more frequently as fireworks became more common, and families began to participate via the paper slip system by setting off their favorite fireworks, turning it into a cherished tradition.<ref name="Yoimiya 1" />

50 years ago, [[Imatani Saburou]] proposed to his wife [[Imatani Kaori]] at the event.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Sliver of Hope}}</ref> [[Takami]] from the [[Yashiro Commission]] helps manage the fireworks show on [[Amakane Island]]. Watching the fireworks show as a kid even inspired her to work on the fireworks show growing up to help people appreciate the beauty of fireworks.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Takami}}</ref>

On the first year Yoimiya took over, [[Kamisato Ayaka]] requested that she add the Electro Mitsudomoe, the emblem of the Raiden Shogun, into the fireworks show, as the Shogun herself would be watching from [[Tenshukaku]]. The fireworks display that year was an elaborate scene of Inazuma City, and when viewed from an angle from Tenshukaku, the fireworks aligned to create the Electro Mitsudomoe.<ref name="Yoimiya 1" />
