==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Augustus Lovelace:''' The structure of ships here in Sumeru is interesting indeed. Hmm, inspiring, too...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Oh, it's you. I was just studying the ships here at Port Sumeru.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Though [[Raimondo]] is likely going to order a "reorganization" of my project... which really means terminate.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' But I've spent too long on this research to just let it go.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I couldn't help but start to compare the differences in design between these ships and aquabuses...
::{{DIcon}} What is an [[aquabus]]?
:::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' In [[Fontaine]], a kind of transportation system called aquarails.
:::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Aquabuses are dedicated vehicles that use them.
:::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' If you ever find yourself in Fontaine, you should definitely ride one.
:::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Not only are they fast and convenient, but they even have [[Melusine]] guides on board who will provide commentary on the scenery.
:::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' I swear, I am not exaggerating in the least when I say that riding an aquabus is simply a sublime experience.
:{{DIcon}} Your travels...
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Nothing special, really. I could have come directly to Sumeru from Fontaine... after all, there's a line going straight to the [[Bayda Harbor]] in Sumeru.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' But to make the trip a bit more interesting, I went to Liyue via [[Lumidouce Harbor]] and [[Chenyu Vale]].
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' After that, I took a ferry to [[Port Ormos]] from [[Liyue Harbor]]. Then I traveled northwards along the river, and here I am.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' When I return, I may trek across the desert, and return via [[Romaritime Harbor]].
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' ...However, I have plenty of Mora left, so crossing the desert to [[Natlan]] sounds nice, too...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Augustus Lovelace:''' Goodbye, then. I'll continue my observations. Fascinating, indeed...
