==Profile==
Vichama was an {{Ancient Name|bearer=1}} [[Ancient Name]] bearer with a talent for scouting. Five years before the Natlan Archon Quests, he and his friend [[Mallko]] won the Pilgrimage of the Sacred Flame and were scheduled to participate in a [[Night Warden War]]. However, Vichama suffered a leg injury the day before the invasion was to take place when the [[Abyss]] invaded his tribe. Believing his injuries would be a liability, the team convinced [[Mavuika]] to allow him to remain behind. Unfortunately, the group was overwhelmed by monsters, and none returned alive. Vichama grew severely depressed, having once promised Mallko that they would die together if they ever fell in battle.<ref name="Reclaim">{{Ref/Quest|To Reclaim an Ancient Name}}</ref>

During the Natlan Archon Quests, Vichama agrees to aid [[Kachina]]'s rescue party after hearing about their plan to recover her Ancient Name, which had been lost due to the Abyss' interference; in exchange, he is allowed to search for Mallko's Ancient Name afterwards. Although he fails to find Mallko's Ancient Name, he recovers Mallko's last memories<ref name="Reclaim" /> &mdash; and unwittingly causes portions of Mallko's spirit to briefly reassemble, who goes on to aid Kachina's rescue party after they venture into the [[Night Kingdom]].<ref name="Eternal Night">{{Ref/Quest|Into Eternal Night}}</ref> The [[Traveler]] can inform Vichama of this turn of events after returning, which brings Vichama peace of mind. He promises Mallko that they will be reunited one day.

This day comes to pass sooner rather than later. During the Abyss' large-scale assault in ''The Rainbow Destined to Burn'', Vichama participates in the defense of the Scions of the Canopy and perishes off-screen. The Traveler finds his name among those memorialized in the [[Record Penned by All]], and another memorial comprised of his visors and a flower can be found within the "Scions of the Canopy,” where he once stood.

==Story==
===History===
Growing up, Vichama was close friends with a fellow tribesman named Mallko. Vichama's talent at scouting and reading the battlefield, combined with Mallko's strength, made the two a formidable pair. They were friends with [[Atea]], another famous fighter, and were considered among her "hot spring buddies." <ref name="Reclaim" />

Five years ago, Vichama and Mallko emerged victors of the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]] and were selected to participate in the Night Warden Wars. They promised each other that even if they never rooted out the Abyss for good, they would at least fight together to the very end. However, the Abyss attacked the Scions of the Canopy the night before they set to depart, and Vichama's leg was injured while rescuing someone. On account of his injury, the rest of the team deemed it unwise to bring him into battle with them, and Mavuika gave him permission to stay behind. Unfortunately for the rest of the team, they faced far more enemies than anyone expected, and they had a lapse of judgement which led them to be overwhelmed and killed by monsters. Believing his presence could have prevented them from making that fatal error, Vichama blamed himself for their deaths and deeply regretted that he lost his chance to make good on his promise to Mallko.<ref name="Reclaim" />

Despite the attempts of those around him to console him, Vichama sank into a deep depression. For the next five years, he whiled away his time gazing at the scenery from the clifftops, reflecting on how things could have been different.<ref name="Reclaim" />

===Present Day===
During the {{Quest|To Reclaim an Ancient Name}}, Vichama is sought out by [[Chasca]], [[Mualani]], and the Traveler as someone who would be able to use the Spiritspeaker Stone to retrieve Kachina's Ancient Name, as she died in the latest Night Warden Wars but could not be resurrected due to the Abyss' interference. After learning of their plan, he agrees to assist in exchange for allowing him to pursue his own goal &mdash; to do the same for Mallko's Ancient Name, so Mallko can be revived.

He successfully retrieves Kachina's Ancient Name, but using the Spiritspeaker Stone to connect to the Night Kingdom causes the Abyss to encroach on the ritual site. Though the Traveler attempts to purify the Stone to buy Vichama time as he searches for Mallko's name, Chasca ultimately destroys the Stone to prevent Vichama from being corroded. Vichama's efforts were not entirely for naught, as he was able to retrieve memories of Mallko's last moments, and he encourages Mualani's determination to save Kachina. After Chasca teaches him how to manage the Abyss' corrosion that entered his body during the ritual, the group brings him back to the Scions of the Canopy.

Unbeknownst to the group at the time, Vichama's attempt to find Mallko's Ancient Name causes parts of Mallko's self to reassemble, although only temporarily. He guides them to Kachina, but is vanquished off-screen after using the little time he had left to stall the Abyss Lector that was following them.<ref name="Eternal Night" /> Afterwards, the Traveler can tell Vichama about the encounter, which gives Vichama a sense of relief.

During the Abyss invasion in ''The Rainbow Destined to Burn'', Vichama partakes in the defense but is eventually slain by monsters.He had stayed behind to facilitate escape for others, and was killed. After Natlan emerges victorious, his name is among those recorded in the Record Penned by All, a memorial set up outside the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. The Scions of the Canopy also create a memorial for him within the village. Since the Ode of Resurrection was not functional at the time, he was unable to enter the Night Kingdom, leaving his soul to wander the overworld and at the risk of fading away.

===Legacy===
The Traveler, [[Paimon]], [[Xilonen]], and [[Citlali]] later encounter his lost spirit upon testing the Traveler's new [[Obsidian Ancient Name]]. He thanks Citlali for allowing the use of the Spiritspeaker Stone, and was grateful to have been able to fulfill his dream of serving in the Night Warden Wars, even though it had resulted in his death. Citlali managed to use her spells to send his soul to the Night Kingdom, as he had only recently died and was not severely degraded.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Sun Rises and Sets}}</ref>

Due to this, coupled with the strengthening of the Night Kingdom after the Abyss' defeat, Mallko's soul was strengthened, and Vichama was finally able to reunite with his friend after not seeing him for so long. When the Traveler came upon a dense fog in the Night Kingdom, the two appeared and helped them navigate through it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Journey of Stars and Flames}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Although Vichama's Ancient Name is never revealed, its meaning was revealed to be "to seek."<ref name="Reclaim" />

===Etymology===
* In {{w|Inca mythology}}, Vichama is the god of death and the son of {{w|Inti}}. His body was formed from the remains of his deceased older brother, Mallko.
