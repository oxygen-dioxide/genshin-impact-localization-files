'''Radishes''' are a [[Cooking Ingredient]] found in the wild in [[Teyvat]].

==How to Obtain==
Radishes grow in various locations of Teyvat, mainly in [[Mondstadt]], and most often grow alongside other Radishes and/or [[Carrot]]s.

See the Video Guides section or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=168 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

They can also be dropped by destructible crates, barrels and pots as well as [[Investigation]] points.
