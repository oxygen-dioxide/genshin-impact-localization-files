==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Fengyan:''' At your service.
:{{DIcon}} You are...?
::'''Fengyan:''' Name: Fengyan. Occupation: [[Millelith Sergeant]]. {{MC|Sir|Ma'am|mc=1}}.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the Millelith.
:::'''Fengyan:''' "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."
:::'''Fengyan:''' The Millelith is the successor to the Millelith Brigade that served long ago during the [[Archon War]].
:::'''Fengyan:''' Today, the Millelith rarely encounters any truly evil forces of the kind we are sworn to defend against. But we serve with the same rock-solid commitment as our predecessors did.
:::'''Fengyan:''' You may find on a day-to-day basis that some in our ranks fail to display the level of military discipline you might expect. But rest assured that if a truly diabolical threat ever did present itself, every last one of us would fight tooth and nail to protect Liyue.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Sergeant?
:::'''Fengyan:''' It's just a title. All it means is that I had more of a knack than my comrades for unarmed combat, so I was tasked with teaching martial arts to the new recruits.
:::'''Fengyan:''' Your eyes... they remind me of a soldier I once trained. He was on track to take over from me...
:::'''Fengyan:''' ...Unfortunately, he died in a tragic accident. I had planned to personally present him with this flower on the day of his promotion to Sergeant, but I never had the chance...
:::'''Fengyan:''' Sorry, that was more than you needed to hear. Please, take the flower, I feel it'll make up for it all somehow.
::;(Obtain 3{{star}} [[Instructor's Brooch]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Fengyan:''' I am in charge of patrolling the area around [[Yiyan Temple]]. This is where we hold the [[Rite of Descension]], so we must pay special attention to safety measures.
::'''Fengyan:''' When I was young, I accompanied my father to take part in several Rites, in order to see [[Rex Lapis]]' true appearance.
::'''Fengyan:''' The majesty and divinity of Rex Lapis at the rite made a deep impression on me, one that stayed with me my entire life &mdash; from my personality to the path I've chosen in life.
::'''Fengyan:''' Ugh, look at me. One slip of the tongue, and I end up saying so much... If you see anything unusual, please feel free to let me know.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Fengyan:''' Farewell.
