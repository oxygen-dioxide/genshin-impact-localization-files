{{Lang|'''Mikoshi Chiyo'''|ja=御輿千代|ja_rm=Mikoshi Chiyo}}, also known as {{Lang|'''Torachiyo'''|ja=虎千代|ja_rm=Torachiyo}}, was an [[oni]]<ref name="Mask of the Kijin">{{Ref/Item|Mask of the Kijin}}</ref> and a member of the [[Mikoshi Clan]] who lived around five hundred years ago. She was the biological mother of [[Iwakura Michihiro]]<ref name="Emblem of Severed Fate">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Emblem of Severed Fate}}</ref> and the adoptive mother of [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref> She was a close ally of the [[Raiden Shogun]], [[Ei]].

Chiyo is depicted alongside the Raiden Shogun, [[Sasayuri]], and the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] in [https://youtu.be/ydPqFAEgHzs Raiden Shogun: Nightmare]. She is the second to disappear from the picnic ground after Ei recollects their battle against each other.

==Profile==
Chiyo was once a valuable ally of the Raiden Shogun Ei and campaigned with her against the dark forces that emerged during the [[cataclysm]]. However, she was swallowed whole by a "beast of sin" and while inside its stomach, was tainted by the darkness. Even though she managed to rip the beast apart and slay it, she was forever changed: she would later turn her blade on Ei, after which she was defeated and killed.<ref name="Festival"/>

===Appearance===
She allegedly looked "as lovely as the moon," and was so beautiful that the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] wanted to hide her own face behind a mask.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring}}</ref> She is also described as "petite" and "dainty".<ref name="Redhorn">{{Ref/Weapon|Redhorn Stonethresher}}</ref>

In [https://youtu.be/ydPqFAEgHzs Raiden Shogun: Nightmare], she is depicted with two large horns on her head, red iris, golden pupil, and long grayish purple hair with red highlights. She is wearing her battle-garb: a white {{w|Jūnihitoe|juunihitoe}} with red and pink trim and a gold interior. When Ei recollected their battle, Chiyo is shown with glowing red eyes and two glowing red scratches on the left side of her face.

==Story==
Chiyo was a close ally of Ei and fought against the dark forces of the cataclysm. According to the legend, during one particular battle, she was swallowed whole by a beast with a tiger's body and a snake's tail. While within this "beast of sin," she was "stained by a deep sin" and witnessed her comrades being torn apart by the beast's jaws.

After escaping the beast's belly, she was discovered by Shogunate soldiers. However, from that point on, she came under the influence of nightmares that twisted her perception of reality, causing her to see everyone—her family, friends, and subordinates—as her enemies or being helplessly slaughtered by monsters. In this state she eventually turned her blade against Ei on [[Mt. Yougou]], who struck her down with the [[Musou no Hitotachi]], severing her sword-arm and one of her horns and splitting Mt. Yougou into two hills in the process.<ref name="Festival">{{Ref/Quest|As Though Beholding Illusions}}</ref> She then fled and disappeared into the forest, with her ultimate fate left unknown: people believe she was slain by either the [[tengu]], the [[Shuumatsuban]], or even the [[Iwakura Clan]]. Others claim that she encountered an "oni-masked, sword-bearing doll," likely referring to the [[Maguu Kenki]].<ref name="Mask of the Kijin" /> Her severed horn was buried and was later discovered by the bake-danuki [[Tetsunosuke]], [[Kinkaku]], [[Ginkaku]], and under the influence of the nightmares contained in the horn, they began to see humans as monsters intent on harming them.<ref name="Festival"/>

==Legacy==
After her severed and corrupted horn was found by three bake-danuki, the "Nightmare" used their anxiety to create panic among human and youkai. Eventually, they were discovered and the [[Traveler]] purifies them to remove them from nightmares.<ref name="Festival"/>

==Trivia==
* Based on her appearance in Raiden Shogun's Character Teaser, Chiyo was right-handed. This also means she lost her right arm during her battle against the Raiden Shogun.
* Some time before Chiyo was swallowed by a beast, she defeated the [[Otogi King]] when he challenged her to a wrestling match.<ref name="Redhorn" />
===Etymology===
* Her name {{Lang|Torachiyo|ja=虎千代|ja_lit=Chiyo the Tiger}} is likely a reference to the childhood name of the Japanese warlord {{w|Uesugi Kenshin}} (1530–1578), known as the "War God" for his military prowess.<ref>NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=28016578 {{zh|闲聊杂谈:关于稻妻人名地名角色天赋命座的考据(更新珊瑚宫心海九条裟罗考据)}}]</ref>
** The Japanese name {{Lang|Chiyo|ja=千代|ja_tl=Eternal Prosperity|ja_lit=Thousand Generations}} was a common male childhood name for the samurai class but is nowadays used as a female name. Furthermore, there is a widespread speculation in popular history that Kenshin was a female (although never taken seriously by academic historians). Kenshin is therefore sometimes depicted as female in popular culture.
