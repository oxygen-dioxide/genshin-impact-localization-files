{{Lang|'''Mikoshi Chiyo'''|ja={{Rubi|御|み|輿|こし|千|ち|代|よ}}|ja_rm=Mikoshi Chiyo}}, also known as {{Lang|'''Torachiyo'''|ja={{Rubi|虎|とら|千|ち|代|よ}}}}, was an [[oni]]<ref name="Mask of the Kijin">{{Ref/Item|Mask of the Kijin}}</ref> and a member of the [[Mikoshi Clan]] who lived around five hundred years ago. She was the biological mother of [[Iwakura Michihiro]]<ref name="Emblem of Severed Fate">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Emblem of Severed Fate}}</ref> and the adoptive mother of [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref> She was a close ally of the [[Raiden Shogun]], [[Ei]].

Chiyo is depicted alongside the Raiden Shogun, [[Sasayuri]], and the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] in [https://youtu.be/ydPqFAEgHzs Raiden Shogun: Nightmare]. She is the second to disappear from the picnic ground after Ei recollects their battle against each other.

==Profile==
Chiyo was once a valuable ally of the Raiden Shogun Ei and campaigned with her against the dark forces that emerged during the [[cataclysm]]. However, she was swallowed whole by a "beast of sin" and while inside its stomach, was tainted by the darkness. Even though she managed to rip the beast apart and slay it, she was forever changed: she would later turn her blade on Ei, after which she was defeated and badly injured. Her ultimate fate is unknown.<ref name="Mask of the Kijin" />

===Appearance===
She allegedly looked "as lovely as the moon," and was so beautiful that the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] wanted to hide her own face behind a mask.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring}}</ref> She is also described as "petite" and "dainty".<ref name="Redhorn">{{Ref/Weapon|Redhorn Stonethresher}}</ref>

In [https://youtu.be/ydPqFAEgHzs Raiden Shogun: Nightmare], she is depicted with two large horns on her head, red eyes, and long black hair with red highlights. She is wearing her battle-garb: a white {{w|Jūnihitoe|juunihitoe}} with red and pink trim and a gold interior. When Ei recollected their battle, Chiyo is shown with glowing red eyes and two glowing red scratches on the left side of her face.

==Story==
Chiyo was a close ally of Ei and fought against the dark forces of the cataclysm. During one particular battle, she was swallowed whole by a beast with a tiger's body and a snake's tail. While within this "beast of sin," she was "stained by a deep sin" and witnessed her comrades being torn apart by the beast's jaws.

She drew her sword against the Shogun, but her sword-arm and horn were severed. She then fled and disappeared into the forest, with her ultimate fate left unknown: people believe she was slain by either the [[tengu]], the [[Shuumatsuban]], or even the [[Iwakura Clan]]. Others claim that she encountered an "oni-masked, sword-bearing doll," likely referring to the [[Maguu Kenki]].<ref name="Mask of the Kijin" />

==Trivia==
*Based on her appearance in Raiden Shogun's Character Teaser, Chiyo was right-handed. This also means she lost her right arm during her battle against the Raiden Shogun.
*Some time before Chiyo was swallowed by a beast, she defeated the [[Otogi King]] when he challenged her to a wrestling match.<ref name="Redhorn" />
===Etymology===
*Her name {{Lang|Torachiyo|ja=虎千代|ja_lit=Chiyo the Tiger}} is likely a reference to the childhood name of the Japanese warlord {{w|Uesugi Kenshin}} (1530–1578), known as the "War God" for his military prowess.<ref>NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=28016578 {{zh|闲聊杂谈:关于稻妻人名地名角色天赋命座的考据(更新珊瑚宫心海九条裟罗考据)}}]</ref>
**The Japanese name {{Lang|Chiyo|ja=千代|ja_tl=Eternal Prosperity|ja_lit=Thousand Generations}} was a common male childhood name for the samurai class but is nowadays used as a female name. Furthermore, there is a widespread theory in popular history that Kenshin was a female (although never taken seriously by academic historians). Kenshin is therefore sometimes depicted as a female in popular culture.
