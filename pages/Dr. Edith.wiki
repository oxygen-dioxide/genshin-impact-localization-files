==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Dr. Edith:''' Hello traveler. Do you want me to tell you the tale of [[Vennessa]]?
:{{DIcon}} Did you say Vennessa?
::'''Dr. Edith:''' Yes, the gallant knight and the heroine who liberated [[Mondstadt]]. She grew up a slave, but rose up to overthrow the oppressive ruling aristocrats, securing freedom for all in Mondstadt.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' Legend has it that this is where she ascended to [[Celestia]] and became the goddess who protects Mondstadt for eternity.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' Different legends offer varying accounts of her life, but for the most part they converge right here, at this place, where her story ends.
::{{DIcon}}Tell me about the huge tree.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' This oak tree grew at the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia, in the same year she left. I daresay you won't find a bigger tree in all of Mondstadt!
::'''Dr. Edith:''' I have come across so many stories and ballads about this tree in my time, far too many to count. Let's find somewhere to sit, I could talk non-stop about them for days...
::{{DIcon}} Maybe next time.
:::'''Dr. Edith:''' Okay, never mind. The offer will still be there when you want it though!
::{{DIcon}} What's Celestia?
:::'''Dr. Edith:''' Celestia is where all the great heroes and heroines of the mortal realm go at the end of their lives. Those heroic enough to be accepted into Celestia become one of the gods and continue to keep watch over their people from on high.
:::'''Dr. Edith:''' Mere mortals will never know what Celestia looks like.
:::'''Dr. Edith:''' Even though there are many gods who roam the land in [[Teyvat]], they are silent on the topic of Celestia.
:::'''Dr. Edith:''' Maybe only those heroes who have lived and died in the mortal realm earn the right to tell the story of Celestia.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Her story really is fantastic.
:::'''Dr. Edith:''' Isn't it? Her whole life was resistance. This must be the spirit of freedom that runs through Mondstadt.
:::'''Dr. Edith:''' If you want to understand more about her past, why not give this book a read?
::;(Obtain {{Item|The Legend of Vennessa (I)}})
:{{DIcon}} You are...?
::'''Dr. Edith:''' Ah, sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. Just call me Edith. I'm a historian and folklore researcher, lately I've been looking for material for my new book.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' You might have met the scholar with the strange [[hilichurl]] obsession? That's my older sister, Ella Musk.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' Farewell, and may Vennessa watch over you.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Dr. Edith:''' Hmm, you're not celebrating the festival in the city. Are you, by any chance... an Asterist?
:{{DIcon}} Asterists?
::'''Dr. Edith:''' Yes. They are also known as the "Windblume Traditionalists."
::'''Dr. Edith:''' As opposed to a celebration of romance, they believe that the Windblume Festival is more about commemorating the liberation of Old Mondstadt from tyranny.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' As far as I'm aware, "Windblume" was possibly once a code word for people who wished to stay in contact and plot resistance in secret...
::'''Dr. Edith:''' But most people have forgotten this layer of meaning, and so those who feel that this festival should stand for the liberation of Mondstadt have become the minority.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' [[Windwheel Aster]]s bear the title of "the visible winds," and so the traditionalists have chosen it to represent them.
:{{DIcon}} What camp do you belong to?
::'''Dr. Edith:''' Me? I don't put much importance on what sort of flower the "Windblume" actually is.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' I'm a researcher and writer who studies history and culture. I must maintain a neutral stance...
::'''Dr. Edith:''' ...Opinion is the great enemy of scholarship.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' But if you find any documents or material of historical value, you're welcome to discuss them with me.
:{{DIcon}} Did you say Vennessa?
:;(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Dr. Edith:''' Indeed. No matter which camp you belong in, remember to enjoy this hard-earned freedom that we possess.

==Trivia==
* One of her ancestors is Jacob Musk, author of "An Investigation into the Cultural Customs of the Wind Kingdom," which was excerpted in [[Breeze Amidst the Forest Supplement: The Dragon Tome]]. Based on the fact that the cataclysm of 500 years ago occurred "a hundred years ago" at the time the book was written, he lived 400 years ago.
* Her English idle voice-over is erroneously also used as [[Adelinde]]'s voice-over.
* At the conclusion of [[Invitation of Windblume]] It is confirmed by [[Venti]] that Dr. Edith's suspicion about "Windblume" being a codephrase used during the liberation is indeed correct, as opposed to being the name of a long lost species of flower as most residents of Mondstadt believe.
