Investigating three empty [[Wooden Crate]]s in the water in the center of the Production Zone will cause Grainville to thank the player and spawn a [[Common Chest]] containing {{Item|Primogem|x=2}} and {{Item|Credit Coupons|x=30}}.
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Open the first crate)
:'''Paimon:''' Could it be useful? Uh... Guess not...

;(Open the second crate)
:'''Paimon:''' This doesn't seem to be useful either... But whatever, let's pick it up anyway.

;(Open the third crate)
:{{Black Screen|You hear someone calling, so you leave the water...}}
:'''Grainville:''' It's you! You maintained order in the production zone.
:'''Grainville:''' Maintaining a sanitary environment is part of maintaining order, so we thank you for your contributions to the production zone. These Credit Coupon are a well-deserved reward. Please, take them.
