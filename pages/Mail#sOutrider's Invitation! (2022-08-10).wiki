|text    = Hello! Do you have time to return to [[Mondstadt]] today? I wanna see you!

I happen to be patrolling the area around the city today. How about we decide on a place to meet up? I'll come get you, and then we can find something good to eat in the city...

Recently, I heard that "the golden-haired traveler and their floaty companion" have been doing some pretty amazing stuff in lots of places. I'm sooo proud of you!

But compared to hearing it from other people, I would love if you could tell me all about it in person.

It's always good to return to somewhere familiar for a break before embarking on your next adventure, right?
