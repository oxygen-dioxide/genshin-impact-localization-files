==Description==
Just as the sea beasts within the deep currents and massive waves follow the sounds of water to their resting place,<br><!--
-->So too did the great dragon that once ruled the land of flame have a tomb to amass its legacy.<br><!--
-->There, spindly spider-leg ridges of bleached bones grasp at the sky like giant claws.<br><!--
-->The [[Secret Source Automaton|secret machines]] that guard the night and borders of death were ordered to patrol there around the clock.<br><br><!--
-->That is a dangerous place to any and all, and even the most agile of couriers would not willingly go prying.<br><!--
-->Moreover, why disturb powerful foes who carefully counting down their last days on their claws?<br><!--
-->Sitting around the tribe's bonfire, [[Wanjiru]] suddenly leapt for joy upon hearing the tales of this place.<br><!--
-->For there were no longer any foes in the world more terrifying than them, and Wanjiru, who already possessed wondrous strength,<br><!--
-->Could surely obtain what she desired more than anything else at that time from their remains.<br><br><!--
-->O Wondrous Wanjiru, with whose single swing ironwood that had endured a hundred years would shatter asunder,<br><!--
-->And in whose palm raw ore would be crushed to powder, and before whose arm all boulders that bar her path must bend,<br><!--
-->Not to mention how objects made of the toughest metal were as malleable as misshapen mud in her fingers...<br><!--
-->Where should she find a reliable weapon? After pondering it day and night, Wanjiru finally had the answer.<br><br><!--
-->She leaped into the volcano from [[Great Volcano of Tollan|Tollan]]'s peak, avoiding the creations that slithered like serpents and entering the ruins that had lain desolate for ages.<br><!--
-->As she followed the traces left behind by the heroes who once fought a vicious battle against the great dragon, the great gashes left in the mountainside by their struggle,<br><!--
-->If only she had been born in those times, she thought! Then, she would be just like those ancestors who had left legends behind.<br><!--
-->How she envied those ancestors who had had the chance to pit their skills against the mighty, robust dragon, and to test their martial might against the primordial spirits.<br><br><!--
-->But that jagged boneyard of which the tribe's storytellers had made a point of stressing its deadly seriousness,<br><!--
-->Was nothing more than the lonely corpses of a few giant beasts who had met gruesome ends.<br><!--
-->Just as disappointment was setting in, the young girl with hand outstretched suddenly saw in a trance a huge shadow with wings outstretched, throwing itself towards her.<br><!--
-->With no time to consider just what that figure was, with a great laugh, she fought the golden shadow.<br><!--
-->There is no need to dwell overmuch on the details of that desperate battle. It was an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a battle of raw blows as they fought for their lives,<br><!--
-->Finally, the one who ended the battle was the brave warrior, tearing off the dragon's shattered wing with her two bloody hands.<br><!--
-->And that golden shadow disappeared with a wailing cry, as though it were a creation once real.<br><br><!--
-->As she came to her senses, her hand was still extended, as though it had all been but a fleeting fragment of a dream.<br><!--
-->But had it really been a dream? The arm that she had shattered in the dream still ached dully, and in her outstretched palm,<br><!--
-->A heavy dragon bone had appeared, as if out of nowhere, and it was the spitting image of the tail of the giant beast she had caught in battle.<br><br><!--
-->When she told her friends who loved to tell stories about this, the nose of that High Priest of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] scrunched and wrinkled,<br><!--
-->"The Great Volcano of Tollan is forbidden ground, and ordinary people cannot even enter! Moreover, you were still so young then."<br><!--
-->And the man holding the ceremonial blade said, "Also, are you serious? We've never even seen you draw that blade."<br><!--
-->"Of course I'm serious! I just don't use it because I usually don't need to, my hands are more than enough."<br><!--
-->Beside the campfire, on the eve of battle, she could already see the great black beast's silhouette on the shore, Wanjiru said,<br><!--
-->And she gripped the hilt of that bleached bone blade, silently waiting for the battlefield where she would draw it once more.
