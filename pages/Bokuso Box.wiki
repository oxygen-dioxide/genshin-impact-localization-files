The '''Bokuso Box''' is an event [[gadget]] obtained from the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]] event, which is based on [[Enkanomiya]].

When equipped, the Bokuso Box allows the Traveler to approach [[Illusory Platforms]] and collect [[Tokoyo Legume]]. When used, the Bokuso Box expends 6 energy to disperse the darkness around enemies and [[Aphotium Ore]], to activate [[Guiding Light]], and to rotate [[Illusory Stairways]].

As the Traveler endeavors into darker areas of the event map, the Corrosion Intensity also grows stronger. When the Bokuso Box's Corrosion Resistance is lower than the area's Corrosion Intensity, it periodically loses energy and causes Corrosion to accumulate. (See [[The Encroaching Dark]].)

Bokuso Box's energy can be replenished by collecting [[Light Conch]]es or [[Coral Butterfly]], or by recuperating at the [[Statue of the Vassals]].

{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Bokuso Box 1.png
|text1  = In lightless Enkanomiya, some foes will be defended by the darkness and cannot be defeated by ordinary means. You can expend a certain amount of energy to use the Bokuso Box and disperse this aegis of unlight and deal a certain amount of DMG to such opponents.
|image2 = Tutorial Bokuso Box 2.png
|text2  = While exploring Enkanomiya, you can expend a certain amount of energy to use the Bokuso Box and disperse the darkness clinging to challenge arenas, treasure chests, and harvestable items. As the Bokuso Box is upgraded, it will become able to disperse more intense darkness.

==Statue of the Vassals==
At the statue, [[Light Realm Sigil]]s can be used to upgrade its level to increase its energy capacity and Corrosion Resistance. The Bokuso Box also needs to reach a certain level to unlock certain [[Corrupted Waypoints]].
