===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp 1.png
|text1  = Tap the forward button to instruct the Onikabuto to expend a small amount of Stamina to move {{Color|help|half a tile}} forward and get closer to its opponent.<br>This move will not deal DMG.
|image2 = Tutorial Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp 2.png
|text2  = Hold the forward button to instruct the Onikabuto to charge its energy. When the charging process ends, the Onikabuto will expend a greater amount of Stamina to rush forward. When this rush hits an opponent, it can deal DMG. The Stamina consumed, the distance traveled, and the DMG dealt will all change based on the amount of time spent charging. A {{Color|help|fully-charged}} rush will take the Onikabuto {{Color|help|2 tiles}} forward.
|image3 = Tutorial Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp 3.png
|text3  = If the Onikabuto {{Color|help|reaches its opponent's exact position}} upon finishing its rush and hits it, it can perform a {{Color|help|piercing strike}} to deal greater DMG. You cannot trigger this special attack by tapping to advance, and over-charging will not allow you to trigger it either.
|image4 = Tutorial Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp 4.png
|text4  = The time spent charging decides your rush distance, and you can use the charging progress to judge how far your Onikabuto will advance forward.
|image5 = Tutorial Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp 5.png
|text5  = Tap the back button to expend a certain amount of Stamina and instruct the Onikabuto to move {{Color|help|1 tile}} backward and dodge your opponent's attacks.<br>If the distance or timing of the dodge is incorrect, your Onikabuto may still take DMG.
|image6 = Tutorial Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp 6.png
|text6  = If both Onikabuto unleash their attacks at the same time, your Onikabuto will be knocked down without dealing DMG to the opponent. Take note of the attack timings, and should your plans change, {{Color|help|cancel charging}} to avoid unnecessary {{Color|help|Stamina expenditure}}.
|image7 = Tutorial Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp 7.png
|text7  = Press the Guard button to consume some Stamina and form a {{Color|help|shield}} against hostile Electro Bullets and Jetstreams.<br>Holding the Guard button will continuously consume Stamina to maintain the shield. Use Guard right before an Electro Bullet hits to bounce it back.

==Challenges==
{{Description|After obtaining permission to host the event, the Arataki Gang put up this temporary venue for "Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp." To eventually gain Guoba's recognition and learn the "ways of communicating with shelled organisms", Arataki Itto must now wait here for Grandmaster Hanakado to round up the mightiest beetle-battlers of Liyue, so he and Crimson Staff can keep honing their skills...|Beetle Battle Boot Camp description}}
