<!-- Section 1, Rouge -->
Real names are of no consequence. He roams the land of Fontaine, which he loves most, under the name [[Rouge]].<br>
He shall bring those who seek justice, equality, and hope together.<br>
And they will dedicate themselves to aiding those who have fallen into hardship and poverty.<br>
The world is full of inequity, poverty, and greed.<br>
And until the day all this is wiped away, they will roam their beloved land, Fontaine.

Having read this far, friend, are you willing to take an oath and continue that work?<br>
If you share their ideals, find the withered tree on which the fruit of wisdom grows.<br>
There, ask three times to receive Rouge's honor and tribute.

<!-- Section 2, Freeman -->
He was once wrongly accused and, as he was about to be thrown into prison, saved by the selfless members of the press.<br>
Thanks to the honorable ladies' arguments, [[Freeman]] was freed.<br>
As his benefactor [[Euphrasie]] said:<br>
"Truth is always marching onward, and nothing can stop it."<br>
He has been continuing and waiting. Waiting for those who will carry on his ideals.

If you have read this far, friend, are you willing to believe in justice and hope?<br>
If you share those ideals, please light a flame.<br>
Of the four flames, only that which is set upon the land is the flame of hope. Light it to receive a token of Freeman's gratitude.

<!-- Section 3, Liam -->
[[Liam]] once wore bright clothes and laughed happily.<br>
Liam once wrote songs without fear of taboos and mocked the hypocrites.<br>
Liam will no longer sing out loud or act so proud.<br>
But Liam will not stoop to beg.<br>
And Liam will not bend or compromise.<br>
Liam and his music will travel far and fly high.<br>
And in a vast and empty land, Liam will continue to sing.

If you have heard this song, friend, will you, too, never give up?<br>
If you share those ideals, please retrieve Liam's pride,<br>
And he shall reward you.

<!-- Section 4, Rocky Avildsen -->
He achieved nothing, he loved no one. He wasted his life in the duelists' ring.<br>
After decades of living like that, [[Rocky Avildsen]] found everything he owned usurped by his butler, [[Brandt]].<br>
His assets and reputation now belonging to another, he went into self-imposed exile.<br>
He dedicated the remainder of his life to his selfless friends, in pursuit of their dreams.

Friend, you who know of his journey, even be it from accidentally finding this letter,<br>
Or because you have come to discover his fate for the Avildsen family's glory,<br>
Go and collect his assets, his final gift to the world.

<!-- Section 5, Athos -->
Athos's Grocery sold vegetables, kitchenware, and sewing materials.<br>
It was Athos's pride and joy, but the jeweler Brandt used underhanded methods to destroy both his stall and his life.<br>
Athos stabbed him to death in revenge and dumped his corpse in the [[Salacia Plain]].<br>
To murder someone is, of course, a crime. But is the victim necessarily entirely innocent?<br>
Brandt got his just deserts, while Athos will spend the rest of his life in hiding.

All those who know the full story, if you are willing to help Athos get the truth out,<br>
Please look for the thank-you gifts he has left on the beach between the waterfalls. Your kindness should be rewarded.

<!-- Section 6, Autumn -->
[[Autumn]] had no faith she stuck to when she was alive, and presumably no last messages the day she died.<br>
She once danced like a puppet amidst sweet lies.<br>
When she woke up, the most precious thing in her life, her [[Molli|daughter]], had been taken.<br>
Autumn wanted nothing more than a perfect world for her daughter to live in and dedicated everything to make it so.

If you understand the pain a mother can feel, you who are reading this note,<br>
And if you are willing to grant a mother's wish to protect her daughter,<br>
Please go to the shelter in the center of the lake and take what she has left for you. Your kindness deserves her trust.

<!-- Section 7, Parker -->
[[Parker]] and her husband swore to travel around Fontaine and spent their entire lives on the road.<br>
They had a daughter, [[Penny]], a lovely girl who loved swimming and fish.<br>
They left her with their best friend, Rouge, to spare her the disruption and rootlessness.<br>
Despite the lack of a fixed abode, Parker's life is full of joy and surprises, and she hopes her child will share that same happiness.

Parker also wishes the reader of this letter that happiness. Why not go and find the surprise she has hidden for you?<br>
Hint: The "surprise" is in the belly of the "fish." The key to finding the surprise is in the eye of that "fish."

<!-- Section 8, Barrow -->
[[Barrow]] and his wife swore to travel around Fontaine and spent their entire lives on the road.<br>
They had a daughter, Penny, a lovely girl who loved swimming and fish.<br>
They left her with their best friend, Rouge, to spare her the disruption and rootlessness.<br>
Despite the lack of a fixed abode, Barrow's life is full of joy, adventure, and surprises, and he hopes his child shall share that same happiness.

Barrow also wishes the reader of this letter that happiness. Why not go and find the surprise he has hidden for you?<br>
Hint: The "surprise" is between the "claws." Solve the riddle between the "claws" to get your surprise.
