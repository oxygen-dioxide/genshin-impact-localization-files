{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cheriez:''' That [[Zadra|gentleman]] from [[Sumeru]] seems to be a real careful sort. He'll be fine even if I don't guide him, I reckon.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Cheriez knows)
:::'''Cheriez:''' I just bumped into an old friend, who said he saw a place with loads of [[Condessence Crystal]]s on the way here. There was even some Magical Crystal Ore!
:::'''Cheriez:''' Now, I was in the ore business for a while myself, but not any longer. If you need some, I'd say... this place is a good shout.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]] marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Cheriez knows)
:::'''Cheriez:''' If you're not here to hitch a boat ride, there really isn't any reason to stay. How about sailing to the city?
:{{DIcon}} A gentleman from Sumeru?
::'''Cheriez:''' Yes. He seems to work at the [[Akademiya]], and decided to travel here during a vacation.
::'''Cheriez:''' I've heard that he's very meticulous in research and in life. He found me through several layers of relationships, and invited me to be his guide.
::'''Cheriez:''' Which is fine, of course. I've got lots of free time, so I can accompany him anywhere.
::'''Cheriez:''' But compared to traveling itself, he seems to enjoy designing itineraries more &mdash; he even wanted to carefully calculate the length of [[aquabus]] rides.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I can help to speed him up.
::'''Cheriez:''' It's okay. I don't mean to rush him. It is a good thing to think carefully while making plans for the future and then slowly enjoying the rest of it.
::'''Cheriez:''' It's just that he seems to be a bit too preoccupied and forgot to have some of the bread that I brought for him. I can't finish the bread alone. Would you like to share it with me?
:;(Obtain {{Item|Garlic Baguette|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Cheriez:''' See you.
