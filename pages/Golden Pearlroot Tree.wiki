|description    = Save for certain trees with special nobility, the people of [[Liyue]] are more used to naming vegetation based on their morphology as opposed to their precise species. Thus, it was to these trees with pale branches that they gave the name "Pearlroot."<br>The branches of the Golden Pearlroot trees are very tough and are often used by skilled craftsmen to make into ornaments or furniture.
