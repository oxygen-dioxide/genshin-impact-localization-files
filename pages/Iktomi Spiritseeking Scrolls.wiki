===Summary===
* During the event, the following gameplay modes will unlock in sequence: "Search for Lost Spirits," "Evil Banisher," and "Restoring Fragmented Records."
* In the "[[Iktomi Spiritseeking Scrolls/Search for Lost Spirits|Search for Lost Spirits]]" gameplay, the scattered Roaming Spirits will avoid nearby characters. Travelers must work with other players and use this behavior to drive the Roaming Spirits to the Spirithub and accumulate Spirit Count.
* In the "[[Iktomi Spiritseeking Scrolls/Evil Banisher|Evil Banisher]]" gameplay, Travelers must banish opponents that are disrupting the rite by completing all Banishing Rite objectives and obtain Banishing Aura in order to finish the battle more efficiently.
* In the "[[Iktomi Spiritseeking Scrolls/Restoring Fragmented Records|Restoring Fragmented Records]]" gameplay, Travelers must place the fragments in the area in a specific order and position, and adjust the relative positions of the layers, using overlapping, blocking, and other methods to restore the overall picture to the target state.
* Complete the event's various gameplay modes to gain Incense Crystals. Reach a certain amount of Incense Crystals to obtain [[Calamity of Eshu]] (Sword), [[Primogem]]s, [[Crown of Insight]], event-exclusive Weapon [[Refinement Material]]s, and other rewards.
