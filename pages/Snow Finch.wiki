|description = A chirpy little bird, found in nooks and crannies all over [[Teyvat]].<br>Snowy white from tip to toe, it enjoys a carefree existence in its snowswept natural habitat. Snow Finches are naturally adapted to cold climates and are highly sensitive to changes in temperature. In warmer environments, they become somewhat fatigued, making them easier to catch.
