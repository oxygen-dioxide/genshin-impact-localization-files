{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Xu Liushi:''' Hey now, it's dangerous up here in the crow's nest. Don't come up here if you've no important business.
:{{DIcon}} Who might you be?
::'''Xu Liushi:''' I'm the ship's lookout, Xu Liushi.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' If you were older, you might've heard some tales about me...
::'''Xu Liushi:''' ...not that it's anything worth talking about, of course.
::{{DIcon}} So, about those tales...
::'''Xu Liushi:''' You ever hear the name [[Third-Round Knockout]]?
::'''Xu Liushi:''' That place used to be some no-name watering hole. The specialty there was the wine-fermented sweet rice balls, but they were waxy and soft, and the wine was all there was to the soup...
::'''Xu Liushi:''' I was young then, and I'd lost a bet with some folks. I had three bowls in a row... and got so plastered that I fell off the ship and into the sea, right as we were weighing anchor.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' That incident gave pub its name, Third-Round Knockout. It also lost me my job.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' No one wanted a sailor too deep into his bottle &mdash; only Captain [[Beidou]] was willing to give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' ...And that's how it happened. I hope my story can serve as a lesson to you, traveler.
:{{DIcon}} How's the situation?
::'''Xu Liushi:''' Huh, that reminds me, I did hear [[Furong|someone]] yelling from down below...
::'''Xu Liushi:''' But the winds were too strong. Couldn't hear too well.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' Everything looks normal. If something comes up, I'll ring.
:{{DIcon}} Later, then.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' See you, and mind you don't fall!

===After Hangout Event===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Xu Liushi:''' Hello there, Traveler! Seeing as you've come all the way up here... Wanna revise the meteorology stuff I taught you previously?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a little about yourself, please...
::'''Xu Liushi:''' I'm the lookout on this here boat, Xu Liushi. That I've achieved all I have is thanks to Captain Beidou taking me in and instructing me.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' *sigh* I mean, you  know the thing that happened to me at Third-Round Knockout.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' That's what you get for being young and stupid, and losing a bet with some folks. I had three bowls of them wine-fermented sweet rice balls in a row... Got so plastered that I fell off the ship and into the sea, right as we were weighing anchor.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' No one wanted a sailor too deep into his bottle &mdash; only Captain Beidou was willing to give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' ...And that's how it happened. I hope my story can serve as a lesson to you, traveler.

::'''Xu Liushi:''' Huh, that reminds me, I did hear someone yelling from down below...
::'''Xu Liushi:''' But the winds were too strong. Couldn't hear too well.
::'''Xu Liushi:''' If you have a look, I'm sure you'll see as well that everything looks normal. If something comes up, I'll ring.
