|description    = Fish-shaped pillows that can be seen at [[The Cat's Tail]]. Designed with sobbing expressions that linger on in the mind's eye, these pillows offer relief to customers when held or used as a backrest. It is as if the fishes are "crying" on behalf of those that lean on them. Hence, they are often rated quite highly by customers.<br>Legend has it that before [[Prince]] became the respected Duel Saint of Cats and attained its present stature, it also suffered a few brutal defeats. In such situations, Prince only wanted to lay upon a pillow that wasn't too soft, wasn't too hard, wasn't too flat, and wasn't too round before drifting off to sleep. [[Diona]] and [[Margaret]] searched for a long time but couldn't find what they needed. Thankfully, after a successful match, Prince had a wonderful dream, and after [[Shuyun]] elaborated on the details, Margaret finally found proper inspiration to have this unique pillow custom-made.
