'''Grass''' is a {{Dendro}} construct that appears during Exploration. When using [[Elemental Sight]], grass will appear green.

It is possible to [[Burning|burn]] grass by applying {{Pyro}}, but not all Pyro attacks may burn grass in a single use.

Specifically, it appears that a 2B Pyro application is needed (see [[Gauge Unit Theory/Talents]]) or applying multiple 1A attacks is needed to burn grass.

After some time, the burning will stop. The duration may be related to the theory on gauge decay.

Burnt grass will appear darker than non-burnt grass. After some time, the burnt grass will [[respawn]] as non-burnt.

==Grass Burning Talents==
The following Pyro attacks can immediately cause grass to burn:
*Amber's Charged Shot
*Bennett's Elemental Skill
These are 2B Pyro applications.

The following may require multiple uses to burn grass:
*Diluc's Elemental Skill
*Yoimiya's infused arrows and charged shots
These are 1A Pyro applications.
