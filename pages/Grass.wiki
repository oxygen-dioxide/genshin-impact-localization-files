'''Grass''' is a {{Wood}} construct that appears during Exploration. When using [[Elemental Sight]], grass will be highlighted in light green.

==Burning Grass==
'''2''' [[gauge unit]]s of {{Pyro}} application is required to burn grass. Grass has '''4.8''' gauge units of {{Wood}} and will burn away in '''12''' seconds without the interference of other elements. {{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}/{{Hydro}} can be applied to burning grass to cause elemental reactions and extinguish the fire. Note that [[Overloaded]] reactions caused on burning grass will ''not'' deal DMG.

While burning, grass will deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}} every '''0.25''' seconds. This DMG applies 2 gauge units of {{Pyro}} and follows the default [[Internal Cooldown]] of 2.5s/3 hits.

The level of grass will vary greatly depending on the location. At [[World Level]] 8:
* [[Mondstadt]] grass ranges from Lv. 45 to Lv. 59
* [[Liyue]] (excluding [[The Chasm]]) grass ranges from Lv. 52 to Lv. 60
* [[Inazuma]] (excluding [[Enkanomiya]]) and [[Sumeru]] grass ranges from Lv. 57 to Lv. 60
* Grass in The Chasm and Enkanomiya is Lv. 62

Burnt grass will appear darker than non-burnt grass. After some time, the burnt grass will [[respawn]] as non-burnt.
