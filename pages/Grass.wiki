'''Grass''' is a {{Wood}} construct that appears during Exploration. When using [[Elemental Sight]], grass will be highlighted in light green.

==Burning Grass==
'''2''' [[gauge unit]]s of {{Pyro}} application is required to burn grass. Grass has '''4.8''' gauge units of {{Wood}} and will burn away in '''12''' seconds without the interference of other elements. {{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}/{{Hydro}} can be applied to burning grass to cause elemental reactions and extinguish the fire. Note that [[Overloaded]] reactions caused on burning grass will ''not'' deal DMG.

While burning, grass will deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}} every '''0.25''' seconds. This DMG applies 2 gauge units of {{Pyro}} and follows the default [[Internal Cooldown]] of 2.5s/3 hits.

The level of grass will vary greatly depending on the location. At [[World Level]] 8:
* [[Mondstadt]] grass ranges from Lv. 45 to Lv. 59
* [[Liyue]] (excluding [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]]) grass ranges from Lv. 52 to Lv. 60
* [[Inazuma]] (excluding [[Enkanomiya]]) and [[Sumeru]] grass ranges from Lv. 57 to Lv. 60
* Grass in The Chasm and Enkanomiya is Lv. 62
* Grass in [[The Realm of Beginnings]] and [[Scattered Ruins]] is Lv. 90

Burnt grass will appear darker than non-burnt grass. After some time, the burnt grass will [[respawn]] as non-burnt.

The grass in [[Dragonspine]] cannot be burned.

==Gameplay Notes==
* In [[Co-Op Mode]], grass that was burned can be respawned for the non-host players by teleporting away and teleporting back, but only for the player who performed this action. The grass will remain burnt for other players. If the grass is lit on fire, the burning grass will only deal DMG to the player who respawned the grass.
