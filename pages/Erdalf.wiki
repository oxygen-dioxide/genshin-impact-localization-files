==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Erdalf:''' Ughhhh... This is my first time trying the delicacies of the [[Collective of Plenty]], and this is clearly a delicious meal, but why does it have to be like this...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Erdalf:''' Oh, hello! Here's the deal &mdash; my name's Erdalf and I'm an adventurer from [[Mondstadt]].
::'''Erdalf:''' I heard the food at the Collective of Plenty was beyond compare, and even better, I heard it was healthy. So, I came here to order their signature meal for one...
::'''Erdalf:''' But just look at the size of this portion! It's excessive!
::'''Erdalf:''' How can this possibly be a meal for one!? Is tackling this mountain of food what the locals consider an "adventure"?
::{{DIcon}} Couldn't you have just asked for the rest to-go?
:::'''Erdalf:''' Well, that's what I thought at first, but it seemed a little rude. After all, the owner was so welcoming. And what was it they said again... Oh, right. "Eat every last bite and you'll become as strong as a [[Tatankasaurus]]!"
:::'''Erdalf:''' Still, I'm sure they'll be happy to box it up for me if I genuinely can't finish. I mean, it wouldn't do to let such good food go to waste...
::{{DIcon}} Why didn't you just tell them you couldn't finish it all?
:::'''Erdalf:''' Well, I thought of that too, but they seem to view food as a symbol of friendship. If I leave too much on my plate, I'm worried they might think I don't appreciate their kindness...
:::'''Erdalf:''' *Sigh* Never mind. Next time, I'll just have to ask for a kid's serving...
:{{DIcon}} Farewell.
::'''Erdalf:''' Bon appetit... I mean, goodbye! May your travels &mdash; and mine &mdash; be blessed by appropriate portion sizes!
