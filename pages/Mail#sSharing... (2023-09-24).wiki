|text      = Today, [[Lyney]] and [[Lynette]] used magic to create a small cake for me. The cake has a lot of different fresh fruits arranged on top, with dollops of cream frosting crowded in between that reminded me of water droplets. It looked really delicious. I wanted to cut a piece for you, but I just couldn't find the right angle to cut it, though I tried for a long time. The cake really is just too perfect. After discussing with Lyney and Lynette, I've decided to place the whole thing in a box, and bring it over to share with you.

We took care to walk slowly, so it shouldn't have gotten bumped or jostled on the way.

Cake is a luxury, but friends are even more precious.

...After we finish eating it, would you like to take a night walk with me beside the sea?
