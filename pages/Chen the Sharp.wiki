==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Chen the Sharp:''' Tiger fish! Get it while it's fresh and hot!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy a snack.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Sure thing! Fresh and piping hot, coming right up. Mind you don't burn your tongue!
:;(Opens the Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} How're the fish selling?
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Only about 1,800 sold. I'm proud to say my tiger fish is the most authentic in all of Liyue.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' I mean, at least half the city's barbeque fish is sourced from here, so if mine's no good, then nobody's is. Haha.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' As for how I can sell this much? Well that comes down to my Guhua bladework &mdash; descaling, gutting &mdash; a few quick swipes and it's all over.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Yup, I'm from the [[Guhua Clan]]. Ten years training in seclusion. First thing I ate when I got out was this fish...
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Some say it's a waste of my talents being here, but can't say I agree.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Our founder taught that the noblest martial virtue is to pursue that which benefits other people. I figure that as long as I do a good job, surely using my skills to fillet fish is something I can be proud of?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Tell me about the Guhua Clan.
:::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Ah, the mere mention of it takes me back. I do wonder what everyone's doing these days, you know, my master and all the others I trained with...
:::'''Chen the Sharp:''' As for me, I'm more than happy that I can combine keen bladework with the kitchen arts to bring my customers a delicious, piping-hot Grilled Tiger Fish every single time.
:::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Thanks for stopping by. It's been a while since I had such an in-depth conversation with someone...
:::'''Chen the Sharp:''' This is the sword I used to use back in the day. I doubt I'll be getting in any more sword fights again in the future, so why don't you take it off my hands?
::;(Obtain 3{{star}} [[Dark Iron Sword]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} About [[Rex Lapis]]' death... ''(After completing Rite of Descension)''
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Oh, I still can't believe it.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Can't believe he went out like that. If my father and grandfather were still alive, I have no idea what it'd do to them.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Sadly, as far as my children and their children will be concerned, the legacy of Rex Lapis will live on only in stories...
:{{DIcon}} See you later.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Be sure to come again! I'll always be here.

:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy a snack.
:;(Same as usual dialogue)
:{{DIcon}} Do you say that every year?
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' Haha... Yes, I do! I say the same thing every year, but I'm never lying.
::'''Chen the Sharp:''' It says so in the [[Historia Naturalis Liyue]]: a thousand years ago, all the adepti loved eating grilled Tiger Fish...
