'''"Battlegoat"''' and '''"Ironclaw"''' are a pair of a [[Local Legend]]s found in [[Natlan]]. Unlike most other Local Legends, they are not aggressive to the player unless they are attacked.

While idle, "Battlegoat" and "Ironclaw" will periodically attack each other using '''Charge''' and '''Projectile''', respectively. This will deal DMG to the player if they are in the way, but will not trigger [[aggravation]].

|name_3      = Melee Combo
|desc_3      = Battlegoat swipes with its head and rams foward, dealing '''45% Battlegoat's ATK''', '''75% Battlegoat's ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.

|name_4      = Projectile
|desc_4      = Ironclaw tosses an orb at the player, dealing '''100% Ironclaw's ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit. If Battlegoat is defeated, it will toss 3 orbs at once.
|file_4_2    = Battlegoat Ironclaw Projectile 2

|name_5      = Stomp
|desc_5      = Battlegoat stomps the ground near Ironclaw, deailng '''100% Battlegoat's ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. If Ironclaw is hit by the stomp, it will take massive DMG and begin rapidly spinning, dealing '''80% Ironclaw's ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact. If Battlegoat is hit by the spinning Ironclaw, it too will take massive DMG. If Ironclaw is defeated, Battlegoat may use this attack 3 times in quick succession.

|name_6      = Charge
|desc_6      = Battlegoat marks a straight line ahead of itself, aiming at the player, before charging forward, dealing '''300% Battlegoat's ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit. If the charge hits Ironclaw, it will be knocked over and perform a head sweep to get back on its feet, dealing '''50% Ironclaw's ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. After Ironclaw has been hit twice by the charge, it will form a barrier during the next charge that massively reduces DMG taken from the player. However, if Battlegoat charges into Ironclaw while it is in this state, they will both take massive DMG and become paralyzed for a period of time.
