The {{Lang|'''Yashiro Commission'''|ja=社奉行|ja_rm=Sha-bugyou}} is an organization in [[Inazuma]] and one of the three organizations that comprise the [[Tri-Commission]]. They are in charge of managing shrines, festivals, and cultural events. Due to this, they do not have as much influence compared to the [[Kanjou Commission|Kanjou]] and [[Tenryou Commission]]s.

Their [[Yashiro Commission Headquarters|headquarters]] are located at the [[Kamisato Estate]].

==Overview==
The Yashiro Commission is led by the [[Kamisato Clan]]. They also control the [[Shuumatsuban]], a clandestine organization of ninjas specializing in tasks such as information gathering.

Due to the scope of their duties mostly falling under civilian affairs and the Kamisato Clan's influence in Inazuman society, soldiers from the [[Shogun's Army]] assigned to the Yashiro Commission are fairly relaxed compared to those in the Kanjou and Tenryou Commission.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Hirano}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Hirotatsu}}</ref> While they still do their fair share of work for the government, they care greatly for the people, which in turn makes them the least controversial of the Commissions by many of Inazuma's people.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Toda}}</ref>

As Ayato turned down the Fatui's offer for cooperation with their plot,<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/KxMs7IsSTgs Character Demo - "Kamisato Ayato: Fathomless Swirls in the Forest"]</ref> the events of the Archon Quests left the Yashiro Commission mostly unaffected, even after Thoma's escape from the Vision Hunt Ceremony. As a result, the Yashiro Commission has gained slightly more influence and sympathy.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Nagaoka Hidemitsu|c=after completing Omnipresence Over Mortals}}</ref>

*{{Lang|''{{w|Bugyō|Bugyou}}''|ja=奉行}}, here translated as "Commission," was a samurai title given during Japan's feudal period. The term is used in all of the [[Tri-Commission]].
