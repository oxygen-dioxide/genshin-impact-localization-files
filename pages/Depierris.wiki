{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Depierris:''' Ah, I wish that everyone could come to their senses and realize that Kameras and paintbrushes are two different tools, made for different purposes.
:{{DIcon}} Different purposes?
::'''Depierris:''' I'm not a professional photographer, nor can I speak to a Kamera's various professional uses.
::'''Depierris:''' But as a professional artist, I must say that it can only be used to provide reference materials for a painting, not replace a painting entirely!
::{{DIcon}} You seem to have opinions concerning Kameras, huh?
::'''Depierris:''' Yes... and no. I think that Kameras are excellent, intricate creations that have provided untold convenience to many &mdash; of that, there can be no doubt.
::'''Depierris:''' But if you place Kameras in the field of making art, then their limitations become quite apparent.
::'''Depierris:''' People's imaginations, and the beauty and spirit in their hearts, cannot be directly seized from the natural world. Don't you think so too?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Depierris:''' The beauty of nature and the beauty of the soul are two different things...
