;(Speak to the afterimage within the library)
:'''???:''' Agh! Not a step closer, you fiends! No borrowing at these hours!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't shout at us so suddenly! We're not here to borrow books. We don't even know how to read Byakuyakoku's script.
:'''???:''' Ah. Whew, alright. I'm fine now.
:'''Ema:''' Um, let me introduce myself. My name would be Ema in the Inazuman style. I'm the librarian here... At least until the day ends.
:'''Paimon:''' Until the day ends?
:'''Ema:''' That's right. We're all moving to live above sea level tomorrow. Now, if only I could get those five darn books back...
:'''Ema:''' I'm rather ticked off right now, if you must know. Why, if Tokoyo Ookami in Enkanomiya had eyes to see, it would surely leave a Shade of Tokoyo for me behind right now!
:'''Ema:''' The angriest, most anxious person in Enkanomiya &mdash; that's me, Ema!
:'''Paimon:''' What did you lose that's got you so anxious?
:'''Ema:''' The books are not that important. What's important is that this is Byakuyakoku's final day!
:'''Ema:''' I don't want to go down in history as the librarian who could never get some books back, even up till the last day!
:'''Paimon:''' (That's true, this afterimage of her is forever stuck on her final day.)
:'''Ema:''' *sobs* I'm sorry, Mom and Dad, I've just been a waste of effort to bring up, haven't I? Ah, Divine Priestess, Lord Watatsumi Omikami, I've betrayed your trust, haven't I?
:'''Ema:''' When we get to the surface, I'll consign myself to guarding the Deep Sea Spiritherb. You know what? If reincarnation exists, I'll guard it in my next life too!
:'''Ema:''' You can't be blamed for a job done poorly if all you do is delegate young people to run some errands, right? Right?
:'''Ema:''' ...Actually, speaking of young people and errands...
:'''Paimon:''' Uh-oh!
:'''Ema:''' Wait, wait, please! Don't run off just yet! I mean, you two look kind of busy anyway... right?
:{{DIcon}} Well, yes...
:'''Ema:''' Great. Since you're running around Enkanomiya at the moment, could you see if you can help me find these books?
:'''Ema:''' I mean, I'm not expecting much, but...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, fine. Let's just help her, shall we, (Traveler)?
:'''Paimon:''' After all, she's been reliving her last day for... a few thousand years now.
:'''Ema:''' At the moment, the books that have yet to be returned are "The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku," "Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku," "In the Light, Beneath the Shadow," and the records of experiments conducted by Michiya and the people with him...
:'''Ema:''' As for the fifth book, I actually have some idea where it might be.
:'''Ema:''' "Before Sun and Moon" was stolen, and the suspects have been locked up in the hanging prison beneath Dainichi Mikoshi.
:'''Ema:''' The Jibashiri threatened them, saying that if they didn't give its location up, they would be abandoned in the hanging prison. They would be the last three people left in Enkanomiya.
:'''Ema:''' Of course, that was only intended to scare them. When it comes time to move tomorrow, they will probably be released.
:'''Ema:''' Don't tell them that, though! Among the suspects is a guy called Antei. He's got a real temper, and isn't the type to give anything up unless you really threaten him.
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds like a tough guy to get along with...
:'''Ema:''' Whatever the case, you can start from there whenever you're free.

;(Talk to Ema again)
:'''Ema:''' Is there anything you'd like to know?
:{{DIcon}} What's the deal with "[[Before Sun and Moon]]"?
::'''Ema:''' That book is quite special, insofar that it wasn't borrowed and not returned, but was instead stolen.
::'''Ema:''' It is a chronicle of fables, and is a restricted text. In fact, I believe that Watatsumi Omikami himself ordered that it be banned.
::'''Ema:''' Those three have close links with [[Khaenri'ah]], and have as such been deemed suspects. They have been locked in the hanging prison beneath Dainichi Mikoshi.
::'''Ema:''' You can start your investigation from them.
:{{DIcon}} About "[[Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku]]"
::'''Ema:''' Ugh, that idiot [[Date]]!
::'''Ema:''' This book was borrowed by the young master of a distinguished clan from Byakuyakoku. It's been quite a few years since then. His Narukami-style name is Date, son of [[Eurydates]].
::'''Ema:''' He said that he wanted to build a new generation of anti-Bathysmal Vishap defense works... but I bet he just wanted to have fun building some maze.
::'''Ema:''' Ah, rich people and their kids. You just have to envy them.
:{{DIcon}} About "[[The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku]]"...
::'''Ema:''' According to the loan records, this was borrowed by an envoy from Narukami Island. I doubt we're getting this one back, honestly.
::'''Ema:''' I think he said that he'd go back and turn this into a novel or something like that.
:{{DIcon}} About "[[In the Light, Beneath the Shadow]]"...
::'''Ema:''' This one's just a book of guessing games. The shrine maidens say that it's suitable for children of nine to twelve years, but I feel like it's more suitable for kids below eight.
::'''Ema:''' The borrower was just an ordinary citizen, so I suspect that you'll need a bit of luck finding this one.
:{{DIcon}} About [[Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records|the experimental records]]...
::'''Ema:''' I'm not so sure about this book, actually. This one is not technically a borrowed book, either. Instead, these records were supposed to be taken back here for storage, but those researchers have refused to hand it up.
::'''Ema:''' No one knows where this research site place is supposed to be either. It's all very mysterious.
::'''Ema:''' Come to think of it, I discovered that the library map has another section drawn on it, which is also very mysterious indeed.
:{{DIcon}} No other questions.
::'''Ema:''' You know what? It suddenly occurred to me that "I'm not expecting much, but I'll wait for good news from you" is such an amazing sentence.
::'''Ema:''' "I'm not expecting much" decreases the pressure you're putting on the other person by indicating that you won't be disappointed.
::'''Ema:''' On the other hand, "I'll wait for good news from you" helps motivate the other party.
::'''Ema:''' I'm a regular seedbed for the various lost arts of Byakuyakoku, now aren't I?

;(Collect the five lost books)

----
;(Show the books to Ema)
:'''Ema:''' Ah, it's you. I mean, I wasn't expecting anything... or anything...
:'''Ema:''' How are things going with the unreturned books?

:'''Show Ema the five books you collected.'''

:'''Ema:''' Y&mdash;You got them all?
:'''Ema:''' These four books are the ones I'm looking for, yes... But what's with this copy of "The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku"?
:'''Ema:''' It doesn't have the unified cover that our collection uses, and I can't read a word of it!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we actually can't read your script... But we can confirm that this is the right book.
:'''Ema:''' Really? You're not just trying to trick me, are you? I mean, I'm not trying to make life hard for you. But I... I think I might get another anxiety attack. Could you... tell me what this book is about?
:{{DIcon}} You tell Ema about Watatsumi Omikami's victory over the Bathysmal Vishap...
:'''Ema:''' That... is the story of this book, yes. Well, if you say so, I'll believe you.
:'''Ema:''' Ah, now that all the books are back, it's like a weight has been lifted off my back.
:'''Ema:''' Guess I won't have to look after that [[Deep Sea Spiritherb]] after all. You know what? I've decided that when I get up above the surface, I'm going to become a master of raw fish dishes.
:'''Ema:''' After tomorrow, come look for me on Watatsumi Island. I'll show you what I can do.
:'''Paimon:''' Do you make raw fish dishes often, Ema?
:'''Ema:''' Not really. Haven't touched a kitchen knife in my life, really. But I'm the only one who has read a lot of books about Narukami Island cuisine. You might even consider me the first person in Byakuyakoku to know about the thing they call "sashimi."
:'''Paimon:''' ...Just be careful not to cut yourself, alright?
:'''Ema:''' Hah, I won't argue with you further. I'll let my cooking do the talking! Just you wait!
:'''Ema:''' Alright then, please help me put the books back on that shelf over there.

;(Talk to Ema again)
:'''Ema:''' I should start thinking about what I should call my future restaurant.
