{{Lang|'''Lord Hiiragi Hiroshi'''|ja=柊弘嗣|ja_rm=Hiiragi Hiroshi}} was a historical figure who lived around 500 years ago. He was the leader of the [[Hiiragi Clan]] and was also the [[Kanjou Commission]]er at the time.<ref name="Hakushin">{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring}}</ref><ref name="Statue">Interactable: [[Earth Kitsune Statue]] (Found in a cave along the west coast of Araumi.)</ref><ref name="Ornate Kabuto">{{Ref/Arti|Ornate Kabuto}}</ref> He is known for miraculously building a prosperous trade center from a deserted island, now known as [[Ritou]], and greatly impressing the [[Ei|Shogun]].<ref>{{Ref/VP|Ritou, Narukami Island}}</ref>

==Profile==
Hiroshi desired to create a port in order to centralize foreign trade under the Inazuman government.<ref name="Statue" /> He ultimately succeeded, creating the trading hub of Ritou. To prove its benefits, he imported various foreign inventions, including a [[Snezhnaya]]n blast furnace used to create the hot springs at [[Tenshukaku]] (as a gift for the Shogun) and a special [[Kamera]] which could record memories and emotions (built using a demon-exorcising mirror gifted to the Hiiragi Clan by the [[Kitsune Saiguu]]).<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sacrificial Offering}}</ref>

The Kitsune Saiguu saw Hiroshi as a friend, and remembered his work to bring economic prosperity to Inazuma while reminiscing about the mortals she had come to know, during her last moments.<ref name="Hakushin" />

After the [[cataclysm]], when [[Iwakura Michihiro]] became the sword instructor for the [[Kujou Clan]], Hiroshi trained under him, noting that he would have recruited Michihiro for the [[Hiiragi Clan]] if the Kujou had not done so first. At this time, Hiroshi was still of a young age.<ref name="Ornate Kabuto" />
