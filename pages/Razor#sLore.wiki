==Personality==
{{Quote|A boy who lives among the wolves in Wolvendom of Mondstadt, away from human civilization. As agile as lightning.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Razor is a generally good-natured person who considers his wolf pack his family, and becomes enraged if they are hurt by other parties. He loves his wolf family, but dislikes the fact that he isn't fully like them, being an infant taken in by the leader of his pack, Boreas. While he barely sees any fellow humans traveling in Wolvendom due to its fearsome reputation, he considers the few humans he does encounter to be his friends and is willing to protect them from danger if it means sacrificing his and his pack's dinner for the night. Razor is also a quick thinker, as he is able to fix [[Klee]]'s disasters whenever she goes to play in Wolvendom.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Klee|About Razor}}</ref>

Razor is honest and forthright, due to his limited exposure to human life. He is not used to speaking and only speaks in short phrases and words, finding it troublesome,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Razor|Razor's Troubles}}</ref> but he continues nonetheless.

Like the rest of his wolf family, Razor enjoys eating meat and shows an aversion to most vegetables, only preferring [[potato]]es. He gets along with [[Bennett]] well for that reason and the two typically spend most of their time talking.

<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Razor uses the [[:Category:Medium Male Characters|medium male]] model. He has long, spiky gray hair; bright red eyes; and pale skin. He has several scars on his body, including one on his left cheek and several on his arms, likely as a result of his time living in the wild with his wolf family.

▌Legend of Wolvendom · Razor<br>
A semi-feral boy raised by wolves who hunts among the dense forests of Wolvendom.

<nowiki>========================================</nowiki>

Tales of a strange young boy are spreading in Mondstadt.

It is said that he prefers the company of wolves to men, and is a formidable hunter who prowls the forest. He has rarely been sighted, as he keeps his distance from other humans.

Some say he is an orphan raised by wolves. Others say he is a wolf spirit in human form...

As the rumours<!--spelled this way in the official post, do not change to American English spelling--> grow, so does the mystery surrounding this Wolf Boy.

All the while, Razor the Wolf Boy stands today on a mountaintop, basking in the warm sunlight, with his family — his "Lupical" — of wolves by his side.

The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.</p><p>What kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.</p><p>His memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun.

Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.</p><p>Razor looks at his body and then at the bodies of his kin.</p><p>He knows he is different from them.</p><p>But there's nothing wrong with that, as far as Razor is concerned.</p>

Why don't you come back down to Mondstadt with me?"</p><p>The man offered his hand to Razor as he spoke.</p><p>But neither Razor nor the wolves understood the gesture. Feeling protective, the wolves placed themselves between Razor and the man to keep him away.</p><p>Razor ducked down beneath the wolves' furry tails. He looked at his body, and then peered out through the gaps in the wolf fur to get a look at the man's.</p><p>Razor knew he wasn't the most intelligent of beings, and was at a loss to answer the question that has been in his mind ever since that day.</p><p>"Am I a human, or a wolf?"</p>

Unwieldy though this steel claw may be, thought Razor, it was at least sharp enough to cut through tree branches.</p><p>"Now you can protect your friends."</p><p>"Fr-ren-dzz..."</p><p>Razor imitated the sounds the man made, without understanding what they meant.</p><p>Similarly, he did not understand why the names of things were all that important in the first place. After all, he never learned the name of that man before he left.</p>

He just couldn't figure it out.</p><p>Until one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.</p><p>They stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together &mdash; she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.</p><p>Her name was [[Klee]]. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again.</p><p>"Friends... is... Lupical."</p><p>Razor may not understand the complexity of human relationships, but he has an honest, primal loyalty to him.</p><p>"So... protect friends... Lupical... with life."</p><p>The wolf pack howls in the distance, summoning him home.</p><p>Razor still does not know if he is a human or a wolf.</p><p>But he is happy either way.</p>

The wolf pack ran to his aid and put up a fearless fight, but every last one of them was defeated by the Abyss Mage.</p><p>As he looked on helplessly at his dear companions being harmed, Razor let out an almighty roar like that of a cornered animal.</p><p>"Lupical!"</p><p>Fueled by his almighty fury, a lightning-like power grew inside, and suddenly an overload of elemental energy was flowing within him.</p><p>He was ready to protect. He was ready to avenge.</p><p>He threw off his shackles and raised his weapon.</p><p>The Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by a wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions.</p><p>...</p><p>Though he had obtained a Vision, Razor was still unable to manipulate Electro energy with finesse. One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge.</p><p>"Friends, hurt... Never again! I will... protect them."</p><p>With each day, Razor grew more skilled in the use of his Vision. He made a silent promise to himself: "I will become stronger. I will become the strongest of them all."</p><p>Because the day may come when his Lupical faces another threat, and this time, he will protect them.</p>
