:'''Hunayn:''' ...
:'''Hunayn:''' Hello. How can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...
::'''Hunayn:''' I came to borrow some books. I've been applying for additional permits to borrow more books.
::'''Hunayn:''' I've read almost everything on general knowledge that I can borrow from here. Hope my mentor can give me access to other books soon.
::{{DIcon}} Do you have any recommended reads?
:::'''Hunayn:''' It depends on which Darshan and subject you're interested in.
:::'''Hunayn:''' I can give you a list based on that.
:::'''Hunayn:''' But only researchers and students at the Akademiya can borrow books from the House of Daena, so you will need a permit.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you...
::'''Hunayn:''' No worries.

===A Parade of Providence===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hunayn:''' Huh? I didn't think someone would want to chat with me even now. Aren't you joining in on the Akademiya Extravaganza?
:'''Hunayn:''' Hmm... What fun events are there... Truth be told, I'm not one for such occasions, so I can't say.
:'''Hunayn:''' However, I don't dislike these celebratory events. The more students join in such galas, the quieter things are over here.
