{{Description|A Fatui secret agent. The duty of a Fatui agent is to settle debts &mdash; but not only those of a monetary or goods-in-kind nature.<br />They also ensure dues are paid when it comes to the principle of "an eye for an eye." If there is one thing the Fatui are not known for, it is leniency, and whoever dares to oppose them will invoke the full force of their wrath upon them.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Spinning Knife Guard:''' Creates 3 rapidly spinning {{Pyro}} knives in a wide circle around them, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} to players hit by them. During this attack, the Pyro Agent's [[Interruption Resistance]] is greatly increased. This is always the first attack that the Pyro Agent uses, and is always followed by '''Invisibility'''.
*'''Invisibility:''' Enters an invisible state, but their silhouette may remain visible should they be affected by certain elements. Their footsteps will show up on certain terrain as well. When using attacks while invisible, the Agent will temporarily show himself. While invisible, the Fatui Pyro Agent cannot be selected.
*'''Melee Slash:''' At melee range, slashes their target with a swift knife blow, dealing '''120% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.
*'''Dash and Slash:''' When out of melee range, dashes towards and attacks with their knife, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. This attack can be used while invisible.
*'''Shadow Strike:''' While invisible, sends a silhouette forward towards the player to deal '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.
*'''Clones:''' After using Invisibility, Pyro Agents create a clone of themselves with '''Dash and Slash''' and '''Shadow Strike''' a maximum of 6 times. Clones can be removed by any source of damage or elemental applications by [[Alternate Sprint]]s. Clones are resistant but not immune to {{Pyro}} attacks. All Clones are immediately removed if the Pyro Agent is staggered.
**'''Clone Charge:''' Once 6 clones have been created, all present clones will circle the player before charging at them in sequence, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, with the Pyro Agent performing a final strike from above, dealing '''170% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}. If any clones are destroyed before or during this attack, the number of sequential attacks before the final plunging strike will be reduced. After this attack, the Pyro Agent will stop generating clones until he uses '''Invisibility''' again.
**'''Clone Slash:''' When the Pyro Agent performs an attack in the invisible state, all present clones will perform a '''Melee Slash''' at their location, each dealing '''120% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}. This attack is only used by enhanced versions of the Pyro Agent found mostly in [[Domains]].

==Strategy==
<!-- Any tips on how to defeat the enemy efficiently go here. -->
*Players can apply an element or other statuses to the Agent in order to outline or mark the Agent's character model even if it turns invisible.
**If the Agent is affected with {{Color|[[Pyro]]}}, {{Color|[[Hydro]]}}, {{Color|[[Cryo]]}}, or {{Color|[[Electro]]}}, then the Agent's character model will be outlined with red, dark blue, light blue, or purple, respectively. Note that [[elemental reactions]] often consume the elements and may therefore turn the Agent fully invisible again.
**Some characters' talents can apply marking-like statuses. These remain visible on the Agent when he turns invisible. For example, [[Lisa]]'s [[Violet Arc|Elemental Skill]] and her [[Lightning Touch|Charged Attack]] with her [[Induced Aftershock|1st Passive Talent]] apply a stack of the Conductive status, which cause a purple number to show up on the Agent. [[Tartaglia]]'s Riptide tag, [[Qiqi]]'s Fortune-Preserving Talisman, and [[Yoimiya]]'s Aurous Blaze show up on invisible Agents as well.
*The Agent's blade often flashes before he performs a dash, charge, or slash. If audio is on, the blade emits an unsheathing sound. Use this to your advantage when fighting the agent.
*Using large [[AoE]] attacks, such as [[Noelle]]'s [[Favonius Bladework - Maid|Charged Attack]] or [[Sweeping Time|Elemental Burst]], will increase the likelihood of damaging the Pyro Agent regardless. Consequently, the damage number will appear above the Agent, elucidating his location.
*Auto-aimers, such as archers, some casters, and Elemental Skills like [[Xiangling]]'s "[[Guoba Attack|Guoba]]" and [[Fischl]]'s "[[Nightrider|Oz]]" will not be able to hit an invisible Pyro Agent unless he has recently been hit by a non-auto aimed attack.
*He can be temporarily stun-locked if one finds his location while invisible, preventing him from moving away. This allows significant damage to be inflicted upon him.
*Using [[Blunt Attack|heavy attack]]s that can [[Interruption Resistance|interrupt]] the Agent or knock them over will cancel their invisibility.
*Spinning Knife Guard has a minimal range &mdash; as long as the player gets very close to the Pyro Agent such that the character is not in the circular arc of the knives, the player will not be hit by said attack.
*Unlike the other Fatui members, Agents do not possess any shields.

==Trivia==
*During the Fatui Agent version of the [[commission]] "[[Emergency]]," the Agent will have one of several names, with the title "Agent - Incinerating Blades."
**{{Transclude|section=1|Emergency|AgentNames}}
* Notable Fatui Agents:
**[[Javert]] is a Fatui Pyro Agent that appears during [[Xingqiu]]'s first [[Story Quest]], ''[[Bookworm Swordsman]]'', as well as [[Tartaglia]]'s Character Tale, [[:File:Character Tales - "Childe- Sigil of Permission" - Genshin Impact|"Childe: Sigil of Permission"]]. When fought during Xingqiu's quest, his name appears as "Fatui Javert," while his title is "Agent - Incinerating Blades."
**[[Kliment]] is a Fatui Pyro Agent that appears during [[Zhongli]]'s Story Quest, ''[[Sal Flore]]''. While being fought, his name appears as "Fatui Kliment," while his title is "Self-Proclaimed Archaeologist."
**[[Sergei]] is a Fatui Pyro Agent that appears during [[Eula]]'s Story Quest, ''[[The Spindrift Shall Never Return to the Sea]]''. When fought, his name appears as simply "Sergei," while his title is "'Friend' of the [[Lawrence Clan|Old Aristocracy]]."
**A Fatui Pyro Agent fought during the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips]]'' is named "Fireblade Mourisu," with the title "Boris."
*During the Closed Beta Test, Agents wore the standard Fatui opera mask instead of the more imposing full-face mask seen after the game's public release. As a result, Javert's voice during Xingqiu's story quest is undistorted in non-Chinese voiceovers; his lines were recorded during beta, before the distortion effect was implemented, and were not re-recorded for the public release.
*Like many other Elite Fatui enemies, Agents are usually seen by themselves, but the ones in Inazuma are now backed up by a Skirmisher, and one Agent can be seen with a [[Mirror Maiden]] near the [[Court of Flowing Sand]] domain.
*Agents do not grunt in pain when hurt.
