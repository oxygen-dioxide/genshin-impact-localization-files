==Abilities==

===Normal===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Prowl
|desc_1 = Creates 3 rapidly spinning {{Pyro}} knives in a wide circle around them, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} to players hit by them. During this attack, the Pyro Agent's [[Interruption Resistance]] is greatly increased. This is always the first attack that the Pyro Agent uses, and is always followed by '''Stealth'''.
|file_1 = Fatui Pyro Agent Spinning Knife Guard Invisibility

|name_2 = Stealth
|desc_2 = Enters an invisible state, but their silhouette may remain visible should they be affected by certain elements. Their footsteps will show up on certain terrain as well. When using attacks while invisible, the Agent will temporarily show himself. While invisible, the Fatui Pyro Agent cannot be selected.

|name_3 = Melee Slash
|desc_3 = At melee range, slashes their target with a swift knife blow, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.

|name_4 = Thrust
|desc_4 = When out of melee range, dashes towards and attacks with their knife, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. This attack can be used while invisible.
|file_4 = Fatui Pyro Agent Dash and Slash
|caption_4 = Normal
|file_4_2 = Fatui Pyro Agent Dash and Slash Invisible
|caption_4_2 = Invisible

|name_5 = Shadow Strike
|desc_5 = While invisible, sends a silhouette forward towards the player to deal '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.

|name_6 = Clones
|desc_6 = After using Stealth, Pyro Agents create a clone of themselves with '''Thrust''' and '''Shadow Strike''' a maximum of 6 times. Clones can be removed by any source of damage or elemental applications. Clones are resistant but not immune to {{Pyro}} attacks. All Clones are immediately removed if the Pyro Agent is staggered.
|file_6 = &mdash;

|name_7 = Blade Ablaze
|desc_7 = Once 6 clones have been created, all present clones will circle the player before charging at them in sequence, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, with the Pyro Agent performing a final strike from above, dealing '''85% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. If any clones are destroyed before or during this attack, the number of sequential attacks before the final plunging strike will be reduced. After this attack, the Pyro Agent will stop generating clones until he uses '''Stealth''' again.
|file_7 = Fatui Pyro Agent Pyro Clone Charge

|name_8 = Clone Slash
|desc_8 = When the Pyro Agent performs an attack in the invisible state, all present clones will perform a '''Melee Slash''' at their location, each dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}. This attack is only used by enhanced versions of the Pyro Agent found mostly in [[Domains]].
}}

===Local Legend===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Blade Ablaze
|desc_1 = At the start of battle, charges at the player many times in quick succession, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} on hit, then performs a final strike from above, dealing '''85% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. While charging at the player, the Local Legend imbues himself with {{Pyro}}. This attack is only used once.

|name_2 = Stealth
|desc_2 = The Local Legend permanently has his stealth state active, allowing him to stay invisible and untargetable between attacks. Unlike the normal variant, the Local Legend does not become visible even when affected by elements. While invisible, the Local Legend also gains '''300%''' [[RES]] to all DMG.
* '''Veteran:''' This ability is disabled.

|name_3 = Clones
|desc_3 = Whenever the Local Legend uses '''Thrust''' or '''Shadow Strike''', a clone will be summoned. While a clone is on field, it will launch spinning knives in coordination with the Local Legend's attacks, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. The clones are {{Pyro}} objects and can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reaction]]s.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Pyro|6|Clones}}
* '''Veteran:''' Four clones are already present and can be destroyed, while the Veteran will not make any further clones.

|name_4 = Thrust
|desc_4 = When out of melee range, dashes towards and attacks with their knife, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.

|name_5 = Shadow Strike
|desc_5 = While invisible, sends a silhouette forward towards the player to deal '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.
|file_5 = Fatui Pyro Agent Shadow Strike 2

|name_6 = Shadowblade Tactics
|desc_6 = After creating six clones, launches a spinning knife at the player, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. Then, dispels all clones and regenerates four new ones, occupying one of them. The four clones will throw spinning knives at the player, with the real one dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and the fake ones dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.<br>If the player destroys a fake clone, it will explode, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. If the player destroys the real clone, the Local Legend will be paralyzed and all clones are dispelled. If the real clone is not destroyed after making two rounds of attacks, the attack will end and the Local Legend will resume using '''Thrust''' and '''Shadow Strike'''.
* '''Veteran:''' The Veteran will perform the spinning knife throw, but will not transition to the clone encirclement.

==Trivia==
* ''Balačko'' is a myth in Serbian folklore said to be a three-headed giant.
* During the Fatui Agent version of the [[commission]] ''[[Emergency]]'', the Agent will have one of several names, with the title "Agent - Incinerating Blades."
** {{Transclude|section=1|Emergency|AgentNames}}
* Notable Fatui Agents:
** [[Javert]] is a Fatui Pyro Agent that appears during {{Quest|Bookworm Swordsman}}, as well as [[Tartaglia]]'s Character Tale, [https://youtu.be/ZF4KyX0ASnI "Childe: Sigil of Permission."] When fought during Xingqiu's quest, his name appears as "Fatui Javert," while his title is "Agent - Incinerating Blades."
** [[Kliment]] is a Fatui Pyro Agent that appears during {{Quest|Sal Flore}}. While being fought, his name appears as "Fatui Kliment," while his title is "Self-Proclaimed Archaeologist."
** [[Sergei]] is a Fatui Pyro Agent that appears during {{Quest|The Spindrift Shall Never Return to the Sea}}. When fought, his name appears as simply "Sergei," while his title is "'Friend' of the [[Lawrence Clan|Old Aristocracy]]."
** A Fatui Pyro Agent fought during the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] [[Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips]] is named "Fireblade Mourisu," with the title "Boris."
** [[Ivano]] is a Fatui Pyro Agent encountered during the {{Quest|Undetected Infiltration}}.
** Anatoly is a Fatui Pyro Agent who appears during {{Quest|Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing}}, titled "Head of the Temporary Encampment."
** [[Alphonso]] is a Fatui Pyro Agent fought after ''[[Aranyaka]]''.
* During the Closed Beta Test, Agents wore the standard Fatui opera mask instead of the more imposing full-face mask seen after the game's public release. As a result, Javert's voice during Xingqiu's Story Quest is undistorted in non-Chinese Voice-Overs; his lines were recorded during beta, before the distortion effect was implemented, and were not re-recorded for the public release.
* Like many other Elite Fatui enemies, Agents are usually seen by themselves, but the ones in Inazuma are backed up by a Skirmisher, and one Agent can be seen with a [[Mirror Maiden]] near the [[Court of Flowing Sand]] domain.
* The Fatui Pyro Agents are one of the first few human enemies that do not grunt when hurt. The rest being the [[The Eremites/Enemies#Low-Tier|Low-Tier Eremites]].
