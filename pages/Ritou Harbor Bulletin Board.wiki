:'''Message:''' "Their flagship is especially large. As long as the other outlander ships follow its mast and stay with the fleet, they won't have to worry about pirates..."
:'''Message:''' "It's a shame. I've only heard about this fleet, but I have never seen it."
:'''Message:''' "I've heard people say that this is supposedly the famous [[Crux Fleet]]."
:'''Message:''' "It's just weird when I think about it: there isn't much business to be had during the [[Sakoku Decree]], so why are they still coming here?"

===Grand Narukami Shrine Notice===

:'''Message:''' "I arrived at the [[Kamisato Estate|Kamisato Clan estate]] but was told to keep out. What subsidy are you blabbering about?"
:'''Message:''' "My merchant friends also did not receive any benefits either... How strange."

:'''Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House:''' "The other day, I accidentally lost the only extant copy of the famous '[[Toki Alley Tales]],' written by [[Takizawa Kyouden]]."
:'''Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House:''' "Though it's nothing major, Lady [[Yae Miko|Yae]] still insisted that I post a lost book notice to look for it. Ah, what a headache..."
:'''Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House:''' "That poor book has probably had its pages scattered to the winds by now... I don't suppose it would be possible to find it at this point."
:'''Hiratsuka, Yae Publishing House:''' "It really is nothing of note, but if anyone could help recover it, you will have the Yae Publishing House's thanks."

===How to Leave Ritou===
:'''Message:''' "The [[Ritou Harbor]] is too cautious in guarding against outlanders but too lenient with Inazumans."
:'''Message:''' "As such, all you need to travel freely in and out of territories controlled by the Shogunate is a forged local document."
:'''Message:''' "And it's not as if this is a difficult task."
:'''Reply:''' What kind of idiot would post this sort of information on a bulletin board...

===International Trade Association Notice===
:'''International Trade Association Notice:''' "Outlander merchants, if you are facing any issues or difficulties in Ritou"

:'''International Trade Association Notice:''' "The International Trade Association's doors are always open to outlanders from any nation."

===Kanjou Notice: Docking Fees===
:'''Kanjou Notice Board:''' To avoid congestion at the harbor because of the war, docking fees for outlander commercial ships have been increased fourfold.
:'''Kanjou Notice:''' Please submit any feedback to the [[Kanjou Commission]].
:'''Kanjou Notice:''' Docking fees for commercial ships will be collected by the [[International Trade Association]] as per normal. No exceptions.
:'''Message:''' "What do you mean, 'congestion at the harbor'? It's the soldiers who are occupying the harbor! And yet we have to pay for it..."
:'''Reply:''' I am sorry, but leaving the harbor is free.

===Kanjou Notice: Outlander Documents===
:'''Kanjou Notice:''' All outlanders seeking to enter [[Ritou]] while the [[Sakoku Decree]] is in effect must provide valid documentation or they will be prohibited from landing.

===Outlander's Message===
:'''Message:''' "[[Kiyoko]], I like you."
:'''Message:''' "I am an outlander who has just arrived and thus knows nothing, but it's okay."
:'''Message:''' "As long as you pay the guards [[Mora]], their eyes and mouths are shut. We can go on dates wherever we want."
:'''Message:''' "And I have no shortage of Mora..."
:'''Message:''' "Well, my father has no shortage of Mora, to be precise. Haha."

===Piracy in Ritou Harbor===
:'''Message:''' "Piracy is becoming more rampant lately. I've heard that soldiers from both sides of the war have fallen into banditry..."
:'''Message:''' "Since outlander cargo ships are not protected by the Shogunate, they often become targets of opportunity. It's despicable..."
:'''Message:''' "To our mariner friends who see this message, please stock up on supplies when leaving Ritou Harbor."
:'''Message:'''  "Weapons, fresh water, repair tools, spare materials, please do not hold back on the procurement of these items."

===Poem===
:'''Message:''' "[[Kaedehara Kazuha|I]] wander like the autumn leaves that float to the mountains and seas afar."

:'''Arataki "A Vision Returned" Itto:''' "C'mon, [[Kujou Sara|Kujou Tengu]]! So I heard that you got a hiding and had to flee all the way back here. I'm practically laughing myself silly over here, you know? Ahahaha!"

===People from Watatsumi===
:'''Message:''' "I was often stuck doing lots of rear echelon work, so I never got to see the grand sights of [[Inazuma City]]. But today, I finally got my wish."
:'''Message:''' "The locals here in [[Ritou]] were pretty restrained. I guess it's because not too long ago, we were still at each others' throats..."
:'''Message:''' "But we were welcomed very warmly by the outlanders. Couldn't find one of their stores without discounts for us [[Watatsumi Island|Watatsumi]] folk anywhere you looked."
:'''Message:''' "Looks like our actions did have a positive impact on their lives after all... I'm glad that all the unfortunate things that happened so far were not meaningless after all."

===Bitterness===
:'''Message:''' "Watching these '[[Watatsumi Army|traitors]]' who so often had to give back before us saunter and shop their way through [[Ritou]]..."
:'''Message:''' "And thinking back on all the losses and pain that we suffered during this war... bitterness wells up within me unbidden."
:'''Message:''' "Still, I suppose that surviving and being able to reunite with my family was a good thing in the end... This war has just taken so much out of us all."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I'm not sure if I get to say this, considering that we were enemies..."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "But we've been given a new opportunity by this peace, haven't we? I hear that [[Uyuu Restaurant]] is pretty famous around these parts. Let's go get a drink there some time."
:'''Message:''' "...Don't you act so familiar with me."

===Duel with Tenryou Samurai===
:'''Message:''' "I came here to [[Ritou]] specifically to look for a [[Tenryou Commission|Tenryou]] samurai who once gave me a sword wound on the battlefield."
:'''Message:''' "I was going to thank him for not striking a fatal blow then and ask him for another duel."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I hate to break it to you, but now that we are at peace, Her Excellency [[the Shogun]] has banned all duels with real swords save for duels before the throne."
:'''Message:''' "Agh, come on! That's so boring! ... Ah, whatever. Let's just go get a drink or something, eh?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Speaking of drinking, I do know a good spot. Meet me at the docks later?"
:'''Message:''' "Alright, that'd be great!"

===Returned Friend===
:'''Message:''' "A friend who used to go out fishing together with me has returned. His time in the war seems to have left him very melancholy indeed."
:'''Message:''' "Our neighbors have some reservations about him due to his having joined the [[Watatsumi Army|resistance army]], and have kept their distance for the most part..."
:'''Message:''' "But it doesn't matter much to me. He's my friend and that's what counts!"

===Sangonomiya Ship===
:'''Message:''' "The very next day after the ceasefire came into effect, a ship from [[Sangonomiya Clan|Sangonomiya]] arrived, claiming to want to purchase some lifestyle goods from [[Yae Publishing House]]."
:'''Message:''' "I mean, that's what I heard, at least."
:'''Message:''' "That said, I've got no clue what lifestyle goods they thought they'd get at a bookstore..."

===Business Turned Around===
;(Before completing [[Radiant Sakura]]){{Verify}}
<!-- The message no longer shows up after certain point. -->
:'''Message:''' "The war is finally over. But rather than feeling joy, I think I feel something more akin to liberation, like a heavy burden was lifted off my back."
:'''Message:''' "The supervisors that the [[Kamisato Ayato|Yashiro Commissioner]] sent have done their duties admirably, decreasing the merchants' burden by a fair amount..."
:'''Message:''' "And while the [[Sakoku Decree]] has not yet been repealed, it seems that business has turned around... There's hope for the future now, and no mistake."

===Business Booming===
;(After completing [[Radiant Sakura]])
:'''Message:''' "Thanks to the efforts of various big shots, we can finally do business freely once again."
:'''Message:''' "Many of our friends who'd lost confidence have gained it again, and those who went bankrupt have hope of regaining their liquidity."
:'''Message:''' "I'd love to say more, but things are so busy..."
:'''Message:''' "Whatever the case may be, to anyone who reads this message, I wish you luck in the coming days!"

===Pirates Infesting Waters===

<!-- The message no longer shows up after certain point. -->
:'''Message:''' "While the war has finally ended, pirates still infest our waters, so be on your guard when you travel afar, friends."
:'''Message:''' "I have heard that the authorities are presently in negotiations and that they might resume a cooperative security arrangement with [[Sangonomiya Clan|Sangonomiya]]."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "That would certainly be for the best."

===Pirate Activity Coming to Life===
;(After completing [[Radiant Sakura]])
:'''Message:''' "After the [[Sakoku Decree]] was abolished, trade activities have come to life &mdash; as has pirate activity."
:'''Message:''' "Please remember to keep safe as you sail, and if you are attacked by pirates, please report it to the [[Tenryou Commission]] as soon as possible."

===Trade Routes Restored Partially===
;(Before completing [[Radiant Sakura]]){{Verify}}
<!-- The message no longer shows up after certain point. -->
:'''Message:''' "The [[Kanjou Commission]] has restored a few trade routes on a limited basis, even though this only brings in a meager income even for larger shops..."
:'''Message:''' "On the other hand, the hard work of the supervisors from the [[Yashiro Commission]] has seen many exorbitant taxes canceled."
:'''Message:''' "For our outlanders, our purse-strings will probably remain tight for a while yet, but at least we've got some room to breathe..."
:'''Message:''' "Regardless, these changes are certainly for the better."

===Trade Needs Increased===
;(After completing [[Radiant Sakura]]){{Verify}}
:'''Message:''' "To help deal with increased trade needs, I suggest that everyone arrange to meet at the [[International Trade Association]] to exchange information and ascertain the situation."
:'''Message:''' "Let's avoid any unnecessary competition and convert our business opportunities into the greatest profits possible."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I'm all for it! [[Mora]], here I come!"
