'''Raptor''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] in [[Lepus Chapter|Amber's Story Quest]] Act I: [[Wind, Courage, and Wings]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Raptor is a member of the [[Treasure Hoarders]] and a criminal in [[Mondstadt]] renown for his excellence in gliding, hence his name. He is one of the biggest Treasure Hoarders in Teyvat, the other is [[Yan'er|Big Sis of the South]]. He was once reported by a nun in the [[Favonius Cathedral]]. The [[Knights of Favonius]] attempted to lure Raptor into the Cathedral with an artifact, but he escaped with it. Amber and the [[Traveler]] track his whereabouts using the secret elemental markings on the artifact.

While tracking Raptor, Amber and the Traveler get information from [[Farrah]], a fruit vendor who claims he saw someone fall out of his glider due to carrying a heavy object. Assuming that the person gliding was Raptor with the artifact, Amber and the Traveler follow this lead and gather clues in the area which leads them to Raptor's hideout.

Inside the domain, they find Raptor on the other side of an seemingly impassable gap. Raptor mocks Amber until she steels herself and attempts to glide across the gap. Partway across, a sudden wind helps her. After a short fight, Raptor is defeated and potentially arrested.

He once coordinated with [[Yan'er|Big Sis of the South]] to attempt to  raid some unexplored ruins guarded by the [[Abyss Order]].<ref name="Involuntary Sacrifice"/>

==Trivia==
* Raptor has the same voice-overs and actions to another Treasure Hoarder, namely [[Fei the Flyer]] in Chapter II, Prologue: Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves; [[Follow the Wind]]. While they resemble each other, there is no concrete evidence that they are the same person.
