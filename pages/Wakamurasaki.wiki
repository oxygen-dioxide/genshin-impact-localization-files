==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Wakamurasaki:''' Hello there! Need a few more Omni-Ubiquity Nets, do you?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy some.
:{{DIcon}} So, about the Omni-Ubiquity Net...
::'''Wakamurasaki:''' My research into these nets is still ongoing, but I've got to say that I'm not making any progress at all.
::'''Wakamurasaki:''' I've not been able to achieve the levels of sturdiness, utility, or any other parameter for that matter, that Sango told me were possible...
::'''Wakamurasaki:''' Where did we go wrong, I wonder...
::'''Wakamurasaki:''' I&mdash;I mean, Sango couldn't have remembered that onmyoudou technique wrongly... Right?
::'''Wakamurasaki:''' I'll go ask her when the opportunity arises, just to be sure...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Wakamurasaki:''' See you. Take care!
