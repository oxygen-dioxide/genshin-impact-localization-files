==Profile==
Like other characters in the Mirage (besides Idyia), the blue-haired Ferdinand is a [[Hydro Eidolon]] replica of a human from Teyvat that once visited Mirage and then left it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the Bottle}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Like his brothers, Ferdinand has short watery-blue hair, glowing blue eyes, and wears an [[Adventurers' Guild]] uniform. He has a slightly more stout silhouette than the two other brothers.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ferdinand:''' Oh, what brings you here today? Hehe, wanna try riding the Choo-Choo Cart? We operate 24/7!
:{{DIcon}} No track repairs today?
::'''Ferdinand:''' Aw, come on, what kind of rails need to be repaired daily... And thanks to you, we just fixed 'em! From now on we'll only need to do regular maintenance.
::'''Ferdinand:''' Though... if Haddo starts designing some new track, then we'll have some serious work to do.
::'''Ferdinand:''' Jeroney is the brain, Haddo is the designer, and I'm the brawn. That's how it works.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like hard work...
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like your job is the toughest!
::'''Ferdinand:''' Heh, it's the [[Hydro Eidolon]]s that are really doing the heavy-lifting for us. Besides, if you want to make a new track, someone's gotta work hard for it.
::'''Ferdinand:''' ...*ahem* Feels like I'm complaining. Nope, no more of that.
::'''Ferdinand:''' The carts and rails are designed for first and foremost to make people happy. Passengers having fun is the only thing that matters.
::'''Ferdinand:''' If passengers heard my complaining, they might feel bad riding the carts! That wouldn't be fun for them, haha!
:{{DIcon}} And I'm just passing by...
::'''Ferdinand:''' If you got the time, ride the Choo-Choo Cart more! Tell me what you think, and I'll have Haddo and Jeroney improve it!
