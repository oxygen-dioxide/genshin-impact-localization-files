|description    = An important mechanism within the "[[Daiya's Three-Day Reverie]]" attraction in the Veluriyam Mirage, its full name is the "Wind-Up Great Owl Spirit Mechanism." As such a long name can be difficult to remember, it is often just called the "spirit," though it looks nothing like one.<br>It is said the name "spirit" comes from the Chief Director of the Three-Day Reverie, as a mechanism for "[[Petrifying Gaze]]" was required. After consulting with the [[Hydro Eidolon]] staff and [[Idyia]] herself regarding its intended usage, the director realized that since the mechanism would only see limited exposure during the play itself. "In that case, why not make it cuter, so that maybe we can use it in other productions too!" And thus, the big-eyed birds of the night, owls, were used as the basis for the mechanism. However, due to budgetary constraints and the limited labor available, this mechanism has only been used in one production...
