===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sergeant Lin:''' The troop adjustments are complete. Lemme check the time of the next shift handoff again...
:{{DIcon}} The next shift... handoff?
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' This is confidential information concerning [[Millelith]] defenses, and I'm not at liberty to discuss this.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' Still, I do sense that you're as extraordinary as you are upright... You must be someone truly great.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' Would you be interested in joining one of our Millelith support units and contributing to the safety and prosperity of Liyue?
::{{DIcon}} You can see a person's spirit?
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' It would be an exaggeration to use the word "see." "Sensing" is more like it.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' After all, I'm from the military. I've dealt with plenty of opponents before.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' Some were excellent assassins who were good at concealing themselves, not showing their weapons until the very last moment.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' I exposed their disguises through the extraordinary presences they had, which they could not quite hide.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' And when I fought the ones that could conceal themselves that way... I just had to do my best to block their attacks.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' Still, I try to avoid being on the back foot as much as possible.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' Anyway, learning to sense these auras is a valuable defensive skill, and the sharper your senses are, the better.
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' I'm Lin, the Sergeant of Millelith's troops here in Chenyu Vale. I'm in charge of border defense and the defense of Yilong Wharf.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' The flow of people here in Yilong Wharf is only a little slower than in [[Liyue Harbor]], but we have a limited number of troops, so things are extremely difficult.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' I was sent here because of my youth and high stamina, which are required for the heavy workload here.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' On the other hand, constantly training our young soldiers is also key for our forces to improve continuously.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' The border defense of Chenyu Vale and the defense of Yilong Wharf have seen no trouble since I took up the post.
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' This is the headquarters of the Millelith unit in Chenyu Vale.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' It would be foolish to expose ourselves, so we chose an inconspicuous and unused residential building for our use.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' The decorations in the yard make it look like just another [[Secure Transport Agency]]. Most people who accidentally end up here, like you, have no idea what this building is for.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' As for military training... Most soldiers sent here are elites who already have the basics down.
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' They only need to occasionally train outside the city to maintain their prowess.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you!
::'''Sergeant Lin:''' Don't worry, just be more careful next time.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sergeant Lin:''' The shift handoff timings have been confirmed, and the new crash course and training programs are more or less finished too...
:'''Sergeant Lin:''' Hmm, what's up?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you...
:'''Sergeant Lin:''' No worries. Stay safe at night, and keep away from unfamiliar places!
