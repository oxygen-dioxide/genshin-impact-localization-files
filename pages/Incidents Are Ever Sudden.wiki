{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass through the Recon Ring)
:'''Temach:''' Welcome... Hmm, it looks like one of you has already mastered the skill of flying. So, is this the {{MC|m=young man|f=young lady}} who wants to learn how to fly?
:{{DIcon}} I already have a gliding license.
::'''Temach:''' Gliding license? First time I've heard of that.
:{{DIcon}} What can you teach me?
:'''Temach:''' Here, we aim to have [[Saurian]] and rider stride toward improvement together. Your partner...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrah, rawr!
:'''Temach:''' ...Hmm, sorry, little guy, but I doubt [[Pakpaka Flying School]] is the place for you to show off your skills. Not your fault, though, so don't take it personally.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr?
:{{DIcon}} {{Little One}} is still young, and still has lots of potential to unlock.
:'''Paimon:''' There's no way a [[Tepetlisaurus]]'s potential for flight can match that of a [[Qucusaurus]] or [[Iktomisaurus]]!
:'''Temach:''' Either way, {{MC|m=young man|f=young lady}}, if you're interested in our flying training, I recommend that you try our training course!
:'''Temach:''' To be honest, we've worked really hard to promote it. We've got the prizes prepared, races organized, the works. If you pass, go to Lamizana to claim your prize.

;(Interact with the Exquisite Chest near Lamizana before completing the challenge, optional)
:'''Lamizana:''' Don't touch it &mdash; this is a prize. If you're interested in our prizes, please complete the training course that Temach's prepared.

;(Talk to Cisik)
:'''Cisik:''' Want to try out the training course?
:{{DIcon}} I'll give it a try.
:;(Triggers training course challenge)
:{{DIcon}} We'll be back later.

;(Upon completing the challenge)
:'''Temach:''' Brilliant! Bravo! Amazing! You're the future of Pakpaka Flying School, I can see it!
:'''Paimon:''' [[Paimon]]'s curious about the prizes... Let's ask that person called Lamizana.

;(Talk to Temach, optional)
:'''Temach:''' Congratulations on completing the challenge! You can claim your prize from Lamizana. He's nearby in some conspicuous place.

;(Approach Lamizana after completing the challenge)
:'''Lamizana:''' As your senior, your older brother, even, let me teach you how to fit in and become popular.
:'''Taruka:''' Thanks, but that's not necessary. And you're not my older brother, either...
:'''Taruka:''' By the way, can you stop giving [[Oberon]] crackers?
:'''Oberon:''' Coooo.... Guguuuu...
:'''Lamizana:''' Hey, listen here, you little brat, if it wasn't for your sister...
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me, I'm here to claim a prize.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawr!
:'''Lamizana:''' Oh, a rare guest. We don't see small Tepetlisaurs every day here. And combined with this... Well, you sure have quite a few different breeds of companions, don't you?
:'''Paimon:''' Breeds...!? Paimon and {{Little One}} aren't even remotely the same thing!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hroowr? Wrooo...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? No, well, we're both {{Traveler}}'s companions, sure, but we're not entirely the same. Paimon isn't saying that either of us is better or worse, so don't be sad.
:{{DIcon}} The truth hurts the most when it just slips out...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, you know that's not what Paimon's saying, so don't try to make things more complicated. {{Little One}} is a great buddy of ours!
:{{DIcon}} You're also a great companion, {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hroo? Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon knew you'd get it, {{Little One}}!
:'''Lamizana:''' Wow, that's actually some pretty impressive rapport. Your clothes scream that you're not locals, yet the trust and friendship between you and this Tepetlisaurus runs deep. What's your secret?
:'''Lamizana:''' I mean, I won't sugarcoat it. Taruka and his Qucusaurus are partners, but they don't get along very well. If you really do know a secret, I'd love for him to learn it.
:'''Taruka:''' Instead of picking on me, why don't we talk about... Where their prizes are? Don't tell me they aren't ready yet.
:'''Lamizana:''' Of course they're ready! Just as ready as you are to change the subject, in fact. Which is something I'll have to talk to you about later...
:'''Lamizana:''' We'll be holding an air race soon. If you're interested, don't miss out on this chance to watch it and my wonderful performance! I've got stuff to do and places to be now, though, so I'll be on my way.

;(Talk to Taruka or Oberon before opening the chest, optional)
:'''Taruka:''' How many Saurus Crackers did that Lamizana feed you...
:'''Oberon:''' Croooo!

;(Open the chest)
:'''Paimon:''' It was so easy to get these rewards... Paimon wishes that the [[Adventurers' Guild]]'s commissions were all as easy as this!
:'''Taruka:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, are you adventurers?
:{{DIcon}} I have an Adventurer Handbook, but Paimon doesn't.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! Paimon can be an adventurer at heart without something like that, just like how she's just as skilled as {{Traveler}} at flying, license or no!
:'''Paimon:''' Are you asking because you have a commission for us? Wait, don't tell Paimon yet &mdash; let her guess first. There's only one answer&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' You must have seen how close {{Little One}} is to us, and you wanna ask us about our secret to getting along so well! Is Paimon right or is she right?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawr!
:'''Taruka:''' Uh, not even close.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? But Lamizana said...
:'''Taruka:''' He's the one {{sic|who}} with a problem. He's really good at winning people over. Even Oberon listens to him now that he fed him a bunch of [[Saurus Crackers]].
:'''Oberon:''' Crooo, Cooooo...
:'''Taruka:''' Stop acting like you're the one who's been wronged. A top-notch Qucusaurus must follow a strict diet. What's more, you're the type who packs on the pounds easily.
:'''Taruka:''' That guy must have an ulterior motive for fawning over my sister [[Lliwa]] time and again... I don't understand why she isn't wary of him at all. They even talk and laugh together!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Sounds like he's a nice guy. Are you biased because you don't like him?
:'''Taruka:''' No, there's more to it than that. He's been really secretive recently, and I don't know what he's been doing...
:{{DIcon}} Adults always have things to do.
::'''Paimon:''' Yes, didn't he mention an air race? Maybe he's been busy organizing that?
:{{DIcon}} He mentioned an air race that was being organized...
:'''Taruka:''' But he hasn't put all that much effort into this. All the prep and hard work's been done by [[Paran]]. The way he's running all over with [[Carrewoof]] this whole time, it's easy to tell {{sic|whose|expected=who's}} doing the heavy lifting.
:'''Taruka:''' I overheard something yesterday too! He was discussing dangerous stuff with some outsider on the sly. I didn't dare to get too close, so I didn't hear everything, but...
:'''Taruka:''' I heard "Be on time on the day of the race," "Don't go too far," "lives," "I'll pay the other half after you succeed," and "We'll discuss the details at the north camp tomorrow night"...
:{{DIcon}} Why is it that you only heard the second half so clearly?
:'''Taruka:''' It's all thanks to Oberon. He was particularly restless at that time and trying to go off to see Lamizana. In the end, I just couldn't stop him...
:'''Oberon:''' Croooo!
:'''Taruka:''' That's not praise, you ninny. Anyway, the other person left quickly after seeing me chasing Oberon. Lamizana also acted pretty unnaturally after that.
:'''Taruka:''' He must have tried to pick a fight with me today because he was worried that he might be exposed. He just wants to give himself a good excuse to keep a close eye on me...
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa. For a kid, you sure think about complicated things.
:'''Taruka:''' I get it. You don't trust the words of a child either, right?
:'''Taruka:''' But that's exactly why I want to ask {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} to investigate the north camp with me at night... Y'know, just in case he really is plotting something dangerous...
:'''Taruka:''' In which case, we've gotta put a stop to it! With {{MC|m=him|f=her}} here as my witness, the others will definitely believe me... and Lliwa too!
:'''Taruka:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, if you think all this is just a kid's overactive imagination, and don't want to go yourself, then at least help me deliver a message.
:'''Taruka:''' I've written a short letter explaining the situation. If I don't come back by tomorrow, please deliver it to Lliwa. I'll also entrust Oberon to her care...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a minute! You're sounding more and more ominous. Things can't possibly be that serious, right... Hmm, wait, what if they are...
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, why don't we investigate? Paimon's gonna have nightmares if something really does happen after we ignore this!
:'''Taruka:''' You're willing to help me? Hooray! In that case, let's go together tonight...
:{{DIcon}} Just leave it to us. You should stay here.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! More people aren't necessarily better in an investigation. You should stay here and wait for news from us. Paimon's an experienced adventurer too, y'know!
:'''Taruka:''' Well... you do have a point. I'll stay here and take care of Oberon, then. I also need to persuade Lliwa to keep her distance from Lamizana...
:'''Taruka:''' So I'm counting on you!

;(Talk to Taruka again, optional)
:'''Taruka:''' Oberon and I'll wait here for you to return with more information. Thanks!
:'''Oberon:''' Crooo...

;(Talk to Oberon while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''Oberon:''' Taruka seems unhappy. What happened...?
