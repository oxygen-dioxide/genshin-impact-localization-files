==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Both of Kinich's arms and his neck are tattooed with green ink and he wears decorated black gloves. A green head scarf accessorized with two white feathers with yellow and green tips tucked behind is tied around his head, and a green jumper is tied around his waist. He has a dangling white, lime and green earring on each ear resembling bone hairpipe earrings and loose-baggy green pants with blue and orange accents. His {{Dendro}} [[Vision]] is placed on his right leg, and he wears black boots with green, blue, and gold accents. He also wears a bracelet on each arm - one is green and white, while the other is black and gold.
