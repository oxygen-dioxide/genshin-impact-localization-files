{{Description|Hundreds of years have passed, and the world is once again at peace. This forest of blades stands as testament to the song of clashing swords, the battle-hymns of warriors, the thundering footfalls of monsters, and the crimson sky, as red as blood.|Forgotten Sword Cemetery [[Viewpoint]]}}
