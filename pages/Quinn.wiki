==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Quinn is the owner of Quinn's Fruit, a fruit stall located near the Mondstadt's main gate. During daytime, he can always be found speaking to his childhood friend [[Beatrice]], whom he sometimes calls Abby. Quinn is oblivious to her infatuation with him, and takes her attempts to flirt with him as a serious attempt to haggle for lower prices on his fruit.
