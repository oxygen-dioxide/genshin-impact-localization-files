==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Quinn is the owner of Quinn's Fruit, a fruit stall located near the Mondstadt's main gate. During daytime, he can always be found speaking to his childhood friend [[Beatrice]], whom he sometimes calls Abby. Quinn is oblivious to her infatuation with him, and takes her attempts to flirt with him as a serious attempt to haggle for lower prices on his fruit.

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Quinn:''' Fresh fruit only at Quinn's Fruit!
:'''Beatrice:''' Quinn!
:'''Quinn:''' Oh, it's you again. What will you have today?
:'''Quinn:''' Just a reminder: No discounts!
:'''Beatrice:''' Not even for a friend?
:'''Quinn:''' I've said this before, and I'll say it again.
:'''Quinn:''' No discounts on the goods, because they're worth the price!
:'''Beatrice:''' Oh, come on!
:'''Beatrice:''' What if I bring you lunch?
:'''Quinn:''' No discounts. No matter what you say!
:'''Beatrice:''' Please! Pretty please?
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Quinn:''' 1 Mora for three apples...?
:'''Quinn:''' What is she thinking... *hic*
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Quinn:''' *hic* Oh, it's you...
::'''Quinn:''' That's right. I'm Quinn of Quinn's Fruit. My booth is at...
::'''Quinn:''' Fresh fruits only at... Quinn's Fruit...
::'''Quinn:''' Wait... Have we met before?
::'''Quinn:''' (I'm feeling light-headed...)
::{{DIcon}} Apples...
::'''Quinn:''' *hic* No fruits at night... No discounts too...
::'''Quinn:''' *hic* Come again...
:{{DIcon}} Who's she?
::'''Quinn:''' Oh, you mean [[Beatrice|Bea]]?
::'''Quinn:''' Dunno, what she's thinking.
::'''Quinn:''' Bargaining with me everyday... Even if she's a close friend of mine...
::'''Quinn:''' I couldn't sell her three apples for 1 Mora even if I wanted to...
::'''Quinn:''' You'd agree, right? *hic*
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Quinn:''' *hic* A... Another!
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
====Daytime====
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Beatrice:''' I'm being serious, there really are heart-shaped Sunsettias around Cape Oath...
:'''Quinn:''' Bea, your eyes must have been playing tricks on you. Sunsettias just don't grow into that shape. It's against the laws of nature.
:'''Quinn:''' And even if they did exist, there's no way that they could be sweeter than the ones I'm already selling.
:'''Beatrice:''' Well, why don't we just go over to Cape Oath to have a look? It won't take long...
:'''Quinn:''' No. This has to do with my convictions! Using visual attraction to sell fruit is just a cheap trick. I would never do that.
:'''Beatrice:''' ...Oh come on, why won't you just get it already...
:'''Quinn:''' Hmm? Come again?
:'''Beatrice:''' *cough* Uh, nothing... Come on, just consider it for a second!
{{Dialogue end}}

====Nighttime====
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Quinn:''' Even if she's a close friend, my resolve won't be shaken... *hic*
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:;(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} Who's she?
::'''Quinn:''' Oh, you mean Bea?
::'''Quinn:''' Dunno what she's thinking.
::'''Quinn:''' Ever since the Windblume Festival began, she's been bugging me about Cape Oath and heart-shaped Sunsettias...
::'''Quinn:''' Sunsettias of that kind just don't exist...
::'''Quinn:''' You'd agree, right? *hic*
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Quinn:''' *hic* A... Another!
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
*Quinn is one of the [[Four Drunkards]], local legends of Mondstadt on par with the Grand Master [[Varka]], and is nicknamed "Sir Dullwits the Oblivious Merchant" due to him being oblivious towards Beatrice's feelings.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Nimrod}}.</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Cat's Tail Message Board|Beatrice's Message}}</ref>
