==Dialogue==
;(If [[Starry Night Chapter]] has not been completed)
{{Quest Description|It seems that the Aranara you suddenly encountered has something important to say. Talk to him.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the quest area)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, there's a lonely little guy who doesn't seem to be afraid of us!
:'''Paimon:''' Does he need help? Let's go ask.

;(Approach "???")
:'''???:''' Golden Nara and White Floaty, you are here! I am Aragaru!
;(Continue Aragaru's dialogue as below)
{{Dialogue End}}

;(If [[Starry Night Chapter]] was completed first)
{{Quest Description|Look for Aragaru upon Aranakin's request.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the quest area)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, that is that friend Aranakin mentioned, right? Turns out he has been waiting for us here!
{{Quest Description|update|According to what Aranakin said, Aragaru has been waiting for a long time. Help him look for Arahaoma's formula.}}

;(Approach Aragaru)
:'''Aragaru:''' Golden Nara and White Floaty, you are here! I am [[Aragaru]]!
:'''Aragaru:''' Plants and mushrooms told me you would come, I have waited a very long time!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh...? You know us...? Do you need us for something?
:'''Aragaru:''' Yes! Something big, very big!!!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, slow down. Take your time.
:'''Aragaru:''' [[Marana]] is growing, bigger and bigger. Forests are afraid to speak, afraid to breathe... Marana wants to eat them...
:'''Aragaru:''' To stop Marana, Aranaga is busy preparing the [[Arahaoma]] ritual. But Arahaoma... still needs the [[Barsam Flower]].
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon sees... But where can we find this Barsam Flower?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, you got the name right this time.
::'''Paimon:''' Heehee, Baaaarsaaam Flooower! Impressive, huh?
:{{DIcon}} It must be hard to find.
:'''Aragaru:''' The Barsam Flower is at where mushrooms grow. The place was Nara's home many, many moonrises and moonsets ago.
:'''Aragaru:''' But then... wet dirt covered Nara's dreams, and new plants grew in their memories. They were dried up and reborn generation after generation... That is the kind of place we want to go.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon doesn't quite understand, but it sounds pretty scary.
:'''Aragaru:''' Not scary, not scary. Plants love places Nara are scared of. So, lots of plants there.
:'''Aragaru:''' There are runes left by Nara and Aranara there, for not forgetting and for recalling after forgetting. Go there and find the Barsam Flower!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Then let's go to the place Aragaru's talking about!
:'''Aragaru:''' Oh, right! And also [[Kusava]]!
:'''Aragaru:''' With Kusava, Aranara strong, strong! Can clear the path for everyone! Aragaru can smash the rocks! Hah! Yah! Boom!
:'''Paimon:''' Aragaru is so tiny, but so strong!
:'''Aragaru:''' Hehe, yes, very strong! Hmm... But it has to be a cracked rock with green vines. Ones with no cracks, not strong enough to smash them.
:{{DIcon}} What's "Kusava"?
::'''Aragaru:''' Kusava holds memories and dreams. It is chubby, bitter, and full of power. It is the fruit of flowering plants, and also the seed of new life.
::'''Aragaru:''' This, for you. Take good care of it. Aranara only give this to important ones, so... do not eat it!
:{{DIcon}} What's "Barsam Flower"?
::'''Aragaru:''' Barsam Flower is Aranara's good friend and is born for Arahaoma. It is the source of the potion. Hmm... have to sacrifice juice to refine Arahaoma.
:'''Aragaru:''' Hmm... Moon comes and goes, not much left now... Walking Shroom-Kin are always inside, increasing now... This is very bad, we must hurry.
;(Obtain {{Item|"Kusava"}} if not already acquired)
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|In the hands of Aragaru, the Kusava holds the power to smash stones. Use it to get rid of obstacles and mysteries along your path.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After the cutscene)
:'''Aragaru:''' This is the place where Nara once made their home! There are also Aranara runes here!
:'''Aragaru:''' Use Kusava and I can break the rock, then we can get in!

;(Destroy the rock in the way)
:'''Aragaru:''' Wow...! There are so many Fungi! They're are coming out!

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter the cave)
:'''Aragaru:''' Hehe, this is where Nara and Aranara recorded their stories together. Here are Aranara story, Nara story, and…

;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Aragaru:''' …Walking Shroom-kin!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh...? They have a story, too?
:'''Aragaru:''' No! They're here, too! We have to hurry and drive them off or they will multiply and compete against everyone for nutrients!

{{Quest Description|update|You saw some flashing drawings while you were surrounded by stumbling Fungi. Aragaru must know what they mean.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the runes)
:'''Aragaru:''' Here, look!
:'''Paimon:''' What's this...? It looks like a child's drawing... What's it supposed to be?
:'''Aragaru:''' Memory! Aranara memories can store in tubers, in seeds, can flow in leaf veins... But Nara memories are carved in the stones!
:'''Aragaru:''' Hehe, whenever the moon is high up in the sky, the three of us Aranara would come here, recall stories from the past, just like Nara!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Then what's in this drawing?
:'''Aragaru:''' It's not a drawing, it's a rune... It's a river of light, and in it are flower stems blooming with stars. The river and stars send us brave Nara.
:'''Aragaru:''' The [[Grandmaster of Verdure]] cultivated the bud of wisdom in the hearts of brave Nara and let Aranara guide them... to the glimmering water cave.
:'''Aragaru:''' Hmm... That's it. There are other runes nearby. Let's go and see them.

{{Quest Description|update|The Aranara and the children who used to explore this place in the past have left other drawings that seem to be able to guide your path...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Shroom-Kin)
:'''Aragaru:''' Careful...! There are walking Shroom-kin here, too!

;(Approach the stone near the entrance, behind a group of Floating Dendro Fungi)
:'''Aragaru:''' Over here, look at this stone! I can break it!

;(Interact with the rune)
:'''Aragaru:''' Hmm... The Grandmaster of Verdure lifted the flowery vines, letting the brave Nara pass through the cave to the [[Realm of Khab]]...

;(Approach the stone further in, behind a group of Stretchy Geo Fungi)
:'''Aragaru:''' Over here! Over here!

;(Interact with the rune)
:'''Aragaru:''' Hmm... With the help of Aranara, the brave Nara expelled Marana together with the Barsam Flower. The dark Marana fled, vanishing in an instant...

;(Approach the stone nearest the exit)
:'''Aragaru:''' A big cracked stone. Let me break it!

;(Break the stone)
:'''Aragaru:''' Careful...! There are walking Shroom-Kin here, too!

;(Interact with the rune)
:'''Aragaru:''' Here... the Realm of Khab! That's the Barsam Flower's dream, where the Flower can sleep on water, floating and wobbling, with no risk of being hurt by Marana.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Aragaru learns the location of the Barsam Flower from the drawings on the rock walls. Go with Aragaru to its location.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Aragaru)
:'''Aragaru:''' The Realm of Khab is up ahead, outside the cave... But we must be careful on the way there.
:'''Aragaru:''' This earth is where Nara sleep. Once here were stone homes Nara made. But after they fell asleep, plants came from their dreams and became owners of this place.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh...
:'''Aragaru:''' Does White Floaty understand?
:'''Paimon:''' Not really...
:'''Aragaru:''' Because Floaty is silly.
:{{DIcon}} I see...
:{{DIcon}} So, that's why...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, whose side are you on!?
----
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Search for the Barsam Flower with Aragaru according to the clues you got from the drawings.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the house)
:'''Aragaru:''' Nara {{Traveler}} and White Floaty, let's go! Follow the passage from here and we'll see the exit!

;(Exit the cave)
:'''Aragaru:''' Nara left the stones but didn't leave memories. [[Nara Varuna]] came here and cried for them. The place on which the tears dropped became the forest.
:'''Aragaru:''' The memories of Nara Varuna and Aranara flowed into the forest and converged into the Realm of Khab, becoming a dream... The Barsam Flower won't be harmed when it sleeps inside.
:'''Paimon:'''  Paimon doesn't understand... So the place you mentioned is up ahead?
:'''Aragaru:''' Yep! Right up ahead!
----
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Look for the Barsam Flower with Aragaru and learn more stories along the way...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Aragaru:''' This is the place!
:'''Paimon:''' But this is... blocked by vines? There's no way we can get in!
:'''Aragaru:''' Hehe! Don't fret, White Floaty! Watch me.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... How did you do that, Aragaru? Paimon wants to learn this!
:{{DIcon}} I don't think this sort of thing can be learned...
:{{DIcon}} I want to learn, too.
:'''Aragaru:''' Heh, Aragaru can talk with vines, so the vines will make way for Aragaru! The language of vines is like singing. It's hard to learn for Nara... But if Nara wants to learn, I will teach you!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to learn! Please do teach Paimon later, Aragaru!
:'''Aragaru:''' Okay, if I don't forget you!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|The location of the Barsam Flower is known as the Realm of Khab. It is said to be the place where the dreams of the Barsam Flower gather...}}

:'''Aragaru:''' Let's jump down from here. Nara and White Floaty can fly, so there's no need to worry about breaking!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|There must be a way to break the seal and awaken the Barsam Flower. Perhaps the secret to breaking the seal lies in the Realm of Khab...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Reach the marked spot)
:'''Aragaru:''' This is the Realm of Khab! This is where plants' sweet dreams hide!
:'''Aragaru:''' See? Growing over there is the Barsam Flower!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow...
:{{DIcon}} It's so quiet here...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, a little bit too quiet... Paimon is having goosebumps...
:{{DIcon}} The Barsam Flower is here...
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Why does it look so odd...?
:'''Aragaru:''' The Realm of Khab is very weak... Shroom-Kin came in, ate lots of nutrients, but the Barsam Flower is not hurt... Not yet.
:'''Aragaru:''' Let's go lift his seal, then talk to him!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, we'll lift the seal. Then you can go talk to him!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|To break the seal on the Barsam Flower, you need to use the Kusava to awaken the power of plants to break the stones.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Paimon:''' The water overhead looks pretty quiet...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's still worried, though. What should we do if it comes pouring down on us...?

----
;(Approach the smaller crack in the north-western wall)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, here's a cave entrance! Let's check it out!

;(Defeat the [[Winged Dendroshroom]])
:'''Aragaru:''' This Shroom-Kin is... so strong!

;(Destroy the stone)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... There's nothing here. How strange.

;(Destroying the other stone)<!--leads directly to the stone at the exit, beware of skipping the Seelie-->
:'''Aragaru:''' Watch out, Nara and White Floaty! There are big Shroom-kin popping up!

;(Approach the stone at the other end with a small pond)
:'''Paimon:''' There must be something hidden inside this stone, right?

;(Destroying the stone)<!--referring to the seal-->
:'''Paimon:''' Haha, there you go! Now let's activate it!

;(Approach the stone near the vines)
:'''Paimon:''' This stone... Paimon just has this feeling that there's something inside...

;(Activate the Elemental Monument)
:'''Paimon:''' The exit is open! Let's get outta here!

----
;(Approach the larger crack in the south-eastern wall)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, there's a cave entrance! Let's go check it out!

;(Destroy the first stone)<!--stones can be skipped-->
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, watch out! Monsters incoming!

;(Defeat the Winged Dendroshroom)
:'''Aragaru:''' This Shroom-Kin is... stronger than the ones we met before!

;(Approach the second stone)
:'''Paimon:''' Did something just hide itself inside this stone...?

;(Destroy the second stone)
:'''Paimon:''' What!? It's empty!

;(Approach the third stone)
:'''Paimon:''' There must be something inside the stone &mdash; you can count on that!

;(Destroy the third stone)<!--referring to the seal-->
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, it's here! Let's activate it now!

;(Approach the fourth stone)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders if there might be something nice hidden in this stone...

;(Destroy the fourth stone)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? There's nothing here!

;(Approach the fifth stone near the vines)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders what is hidden in this stone...

;(Activate the elemental monument)
:'''Paimon:''' The vines are retreating! Let's get outta here!

----
;(After leading the two Seelie back to their courts)
:'''Paimon:''' The barrier here is gone! We've lifted it!

;(Approach the stone to the left of some vines)
:'''Aragaru:''' Over here, look at this stone! I can break it!

;(Activate the elemental monument)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, the gate here is open! Let's go check inside!

;(Defeat the Ruin Grader flanked by two Ruin Defenders)
:'''Aragaru:''' A big stone wrapped in vines! Let me break it!

;(Activate the last seal)
:'''Aragaru:''' Yay! The Barsam Flower!
----
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|All the work is done. You can now pick the Barsam Flower for Aragaru.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Go past where the barrier was)
:'''Paimon:''' It's getting more humid here... Is it because the seal is gone?

;(Approach the Barsam Flower)
:'''Paimon:''' Aragaru just needs to talk to the Barsam Flower, right?
:'''Aragaru:''' Shh! Shh! Quiet, don't wake him.
:{{Black Screen|Aragaru whispers with the Barsam Flower for a while...}}
:'''Aragaru:''' The Barsam Flower was woken up from his dream by us, he is very angry.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Aragaru:''' But if it's for Arahaoma, then I suppose we can be forgiven.
:'''Aragaru:''' Barsam Flower, Barsam Flower, for Arahaoma, for Mawtiyima's revival... Please join us.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh... Ehh?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing, Paimon?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon is trying to listen to the Barsam Flower's response!
:{{DIcon}} Can you understand them?
::'''Paimon:''' ...Paimon can't hear anything.
:'''Aragaru:''' Great! The Barsam Flower agreed to adventure with us!
:'''Paimon:''' Yay! We got the Barsam Flower!
:'''Aragaru:''' Hmm, and... the Barsam Flower said be careful with our heads.
:'''Paimon:''' What does that mean?
:'''Aragaru:''' Protect our heads and roots, or damage will be caused when water comes...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Wait... What is that sound?
:'''Aragaru:''' Watch out!
:{{Black Screen|You and Paimon, together with Aragaru, are swept away by a sudden current...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Ahhh! *cough* *cough* *cough* W&mdash;Why did so much water gush out!? Paimon almost got drowned!
:{{DIcon}} So cold.
:{{DIcon}} So moist.
:{{DIcon}} So noisy...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey!
:'''Aragaru:''' Because the Realm of Khab is the Barsam Flower's dream. When the Barsam Flower wakes up, the dream will disperse into the air.
:'''Aragaru:''' So the weight of the water can't be withstood, and water will gush out! Whooo! Splash! Cool and refreshing.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph... Let's see if you could still say the same if Paimon was washed away and never found back!
:'''Aragaru:''' Hehe, Aragaru knows where Nara and White Floaty are. Plants can also tell me where you've gone. You'll be found!
:'''Aragaru:''' We have the Barsam Flower now, so next is to find the [[Zohrah Mushroom]] and the Yajna Grass before we can ask [[Aranaga]] to make the Arahaoma!
:{{DIcon}} We need two more plants... ''(if [[Starry Night Chapter]] has not been completed)''
::'''Aragaru:''' Yep! I have to go back to the Mawtiyima Forest and can't accompany Nara {{Traveler}} and White Floaty in your search for [[Aranakin]]... But Aranakin really likes to play near Nara territories.
::'''Aragaru:''' Nara and White Floaty must be careful. There are Naravaluka roaming about there. Aranakin calls them "sand"... You can't trust their words! They're bad!
::'''Paimon:''' Got it. We'll be careful!
:{{DIcon}} We have the Zohrah Mushroom. ''(if [[Starry Night Chapter]] was completed first)''
::'''Aragaru:''' Yes, thanks to Nara {{Traveler}} and White Floaty! If it were Aranaga, he'd definitely say, "Just like Nara Varuna, you are..."
::'''Aragaru:''' Hehe, that is to say, Nara {{Traveler}} and White Floaty are amazing!
::'''Aragaru:''' Go find my friend Aranaga. He surely has something that needs your help! You can find him in the Mawtiyima Forest!
::'''Paimon:''' All right, we got it!
:{{DIcon}} About Aranaga...
::'''Aragaru:''' Aranaga is the eldest and most interesting of us three! He can say a lot of funny things and he knows a lot about Nara.
::'''Aragaru:''' But he also forgot a lot about Nara... The three of us all have lots of things we can't remember. Some are scattered like pollen in the breeze, and some are blurred...
::'''Aragaru:''' But Aranaga usually knows and remembers the most. That's why we like playing with Aranaga.
::'''Aragaru:''' Aranaga is right in the gardens of the Mawtiyima Forest, watching over Mawtiyima. You'll definitely find him if you go there!
:'''Aragaru:''' Next... I'm going to the Mawtiyima Forest, too, to prepare for the Arahaoma ritual. Let's meet there!
