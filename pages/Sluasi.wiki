===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sluasi:''' Why haven't the materials I ordered before arrived yet...
:'''Sluasi:''' Hmm. The accessories you're wearing seem rather strange...
:{{DIcon}} My accessories?
::'''Sluasi:''' Ah, I'm sorry. I'm an artisan &mdash; whenever I see ornaments and such that I've never seen before, my mind jumps right to "How do I make that"?
::'''Sluasi:''' Ah, yours are so beautiful &mdash; simple yet full of charm. I love them.
:{{DIcon}} You spoke of materials you ordered...
::'''Sluasi:''' That's right &mdash; I mean gems I ordered from a merchant in Fontaine.
::'''Sluasi:''' I make all kinds of accessories out of gems, but conversely, I can't do my work without them.
::'''Sluasi:''' *sigh* I just wish the goods would come in faster...
;(After Step 3 of ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'' and before completing ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Sluasi:''' *sigh* To think that Puca's run off at a time like this...
::'''Sluasi:''' Well, since she's got friends with her, things can't be too bad, right...?
:{{DIcon}} I've got some other things to attend to right now...
::'''Sluasi:''' Alright then. See you.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''The Three Primary Colors of the Solar Corona''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sluasi:''' Why haven't the materials I ordered before arrived yet...
:'''Sluasi:''' Ah, we meet again. How are things? Would you like to purchase some accessories?
:{{DIcon}} How's the paint-making going?
::'''Sluasi:''' They're still in the final adjustment phase. We should be done pretty soon!
::'''Sluasi:''' It is taking longer than I thought it would, though... But just like with gems, I have to create the perfect paints.
::'''Sluasi:''' If it isn't perfect work, it isn't worth doing. *sigh* If only [[Puca]] would understand that sooner...
:{{DIcon}} You spoke of materials you ordered...
::'''Sluasi:''' That's right &mdash; I refer to gems I ordered from a merchant in Fontaine...
::'''Sluasi:''' Just like how it is with the paint-making materials you showed me previously...
::'''Sluasi:''' There is much work for a gem artisan like myself that cannot start without source materials.
::'''Sluasi:''' Gah, I just wish those goods would come in faster...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sluasi:''' Alright then, bye!
{{Dialogue End}}

== Trivia ==

=== Etymology ===

* Given that Melusines are named after fairy figures, "Sluasi" may be derived from the {{W|Sluagh}}, also known as the ''slúag sídhe'', which are spirits of the unforgiven dead in Celtic folklore.
