==Description==
A strangely-shaped spear made by [[Kitain Bunsou]] for his own unique style of spearmanship.<br>
Its massive weight makes it extremely unwieldy in untrained hands.<br>
But in the hands of an expert, it is capable of unleashing great destructive power.

In the distant past, Kitain used to be a family that hunted the [[Tatarigami]] down.<br>
For many generations, they shouldered the responsibility of serving as the Prefects of [[Yashiori Island|Yashiori]].

In the past, there was a certain children's song that circulated widely within Inazuma:<br>
"Arataki of the Front Gate, [[Iwakura Michihiro|Iwakura the Successor]], Kitain the Serpent, [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]]."<br>
These phrases describe the dazzling warriors who once illuminated the earth like comets.<br>
There used to be many other names on the list, but they have since been lost to history.<br>
And having been a demon hunter for so long, it is unavoidable that one might imbibe some of that miasmic, tainted blood.

==Trivia==
* The spear is most likely a reference to cross spears used by the {{w|Hōzōin-ryū|Houzouin-ryuu}}, a Japanese martial art school founded by {{w|Hōzōin In'ei|Houzouin In'ei}}, a warrior monk who is said to have invented this type of spears.
* [[Thoma]] is seen wielding the ascended version of this polearm in his official art. He is also seen wielding its base version in his [[Thoma (Character Card)|Character Card]] in [[Genius Invokation TCG]].
