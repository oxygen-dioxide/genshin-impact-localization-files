|name_2      = Bubble Spit
|desc_2      = Shoots a [[bubble]] at the player, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} and trapping the player on hit. This bubble will also trap other small enemies and apply the {{Color|Hydro|Wet}} status to them on hit.

* '''Activated:''' Shoots 3 Hydro projectiles instead of a bubble, each dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.
* '''Scorched:''' Creates a single large bubble that immediately explodes, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
