==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Kadenokouji Kenzaburou is a light novel writer. He once submitted an excellent but conventional manuscript to Yae Publishing House, prompting [[Yae Miko]] to request her editors to "tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well." After a few months, Kenzaburou submitted a ''Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden'' manuscript that stunned the editors but greatly pleased Miko, who only requested that Kenzaburou change his ordinary pen name. Miko approved the pen name "Kadenokouji Kenzaburou."<ref>{{Ref/CS|Yae Miko|1}}</ref>

Kenzaburou later participates in the signing event during the Irodori Festival along with [[Zhenyu]] and [[Satomi]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A New Painting in Pale Scarlet (Quest)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Five Colors' True Form}}</ref>
