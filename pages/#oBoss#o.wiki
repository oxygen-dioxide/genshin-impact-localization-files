==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
The "Boss" is a Fatuus representative who approached [[Henri]] and asked him to acquire seven [[Mysterious Core|cores]] from machines scattered across Fontaine. Henri broke the machines down, but was caught by [[Hunter]] and [[Turner]], buried in the sand to teach him a lesson. When the [[Traveler]] arrived, they learned from Henri about his task and decided to help him in the process. After acquiring the seven cores, they returned to Henri, who had contacted "Boss" in the process. Upon spotting the Traveler, "Boss" realized what was going on and attempted to flee, only to be caught by Hunter and Turner, who explained the Fatui's intentions. They then buried him in the sand, causing him to faint before the three men dug him out and taken for further interrogation.
