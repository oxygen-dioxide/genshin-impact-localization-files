==Gameplay Notes==
* Any [[Normal Attack]], [[Charged Attack]], [[Plunging Attack]], [[Elemental Skill]] and [[Elemental Burst]] can be used to trigger the on-hit effect, even if no damage is dealt.
* Only one stack is gained even if multiple enemies are hit at once.
* Gaining a stack will refresh the duration of all existing stacks. In other words, the effect persists for 6 seconds after the last hit, regardless of the number of stacks.
* Stacks cannot be gained if the character equipped with this weapon is not on the field.
* If the character equipped with this weapon is switched out of the field, any existing stacks will last for its usual 6 seconds.

==Description==
At Liyue's foundation, monsters and gods still ruled the seas.

In fear the forebears lived, and fought the sea with all they could muster.

As spring turned to fall and back again for many an eon, a behemoth arose that dominated the seas. Even the Geo Archon's Geo Whale could not triumph against it.

The people of Liyue called it "Baqiu," a beast without rival even in the deepest depths of the ocean abyss. Its enormous waves would wash away entire settlements.

So the Geo Archon fashioned a black kite by hand with jade and stones.

The stone bird took to the unbound skies once forged. Into the heart of the ocean it dove, into the battlefield with the behemoth and the whale.

Into the depths of the sea the behemoth sank, there to stay forever.

Released from its thundering roars were the people of Liyue.

*[[Xiao]] is seen wielding this polearm in his official art, in his [https://youtu.be/sjozpa9DsZU official Character Demo] and in [https://youtu.be/kCmvCpYL34U Collected Miscellany - "Xiao: Conqueror of Demons" | Genshin Impact].
*The weapons in the [[Primordial Jade Series]] are, in Chinese, named after the piece of jade used to create it. The names of the jades are derived from a line in the {{Lang|Strategies of the Warring States|zh=战国策}}, which ascribes a fine jade to each of the dynasties during China's Warring States period. This reference is not present in the English translation.
**Primordial Jade Winged-Spear's Hépú is associated with the {{w|State of Chu}}.
*{{Lang|Baqiu|zh=八虬|zh_rm=Bāqiú}} is comprised of the characters {{zh|八|tl=eight}} and {{zh|虬|tl=young horned dragon.}}
*This is the only weapon of the [[Primordial Jade Series]] that is featured on the [[Wanderlust Invocation]] banner.
