|description    = A gift from [[Aranakula]] and [[Arakara]].<br />It is a Viparyas that used to only grow in [[Vanarana]], but it has now been placed into this small pot, turning into a potted plant that never withers. Perhaps you might occasionally tell it some of your tales of adventure, or play it some music, or hum it a song. Those notes and syllables will be like water that can continue to rejuvenate it. In this way, even if it has left Vanarana, this Viparyas can still be as happy as ever.
