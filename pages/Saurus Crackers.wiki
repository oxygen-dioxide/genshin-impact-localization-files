|desc_basic      = Light, crispy, sweet, and fragrant, with adorable patterns on top to boot — how could the people of Natlan not be won over by such delectable snacks? Apparently, even the Saurians love 'em... But are crackers really the type of thing Saurians eat?
|desc_delicious  = The enticing aroma of butter draws forth the delightful interplay between the Cacahuatl and Grainfruit, while the cute shapes make them truly hard to put down. In the end, even the crumbs that slipped through your fingers were not to be spared!
