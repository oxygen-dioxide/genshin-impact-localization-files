{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aryadeva:''' Hello, I'm planning to set up a Light Novel Society. Are you interested?
:{{DIcon}} A Light Novel Society?
::'''Aryadeva:''' There are many societies in the Akademiya, but no Light Novel Society. It's strange, isn't it?
::'''Aryadeva:''' Light novels don't seem popular in Sumeru, but it is the Nation of Wisdom after all. There shouldn't be any gaps in our fields of knowledge.
::'''Aryadeva:''' I am not exactly a researcher of the Akademiya, but I am second to none when it comes to light novels.
::'''Aryadeva:''' Should we have an initiation ceremony or something like that?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...
::'''Aryadeva:''' I haven't studied in the Akademiya, but I'd like to consider myself a Herbad in the field of light novels.
::'''Aryadeva:''' However, there is no school in the Akademiya that awards diplomas in light novels.
::'''Aryadeva:''' TThat's why it's pertinent to have my book published by [[Yae Publishing House]]. My book's title is "Can a Trainee Combat Mage Whose Normal Attack Summons a Jinni that Will Start a Full-Out Free-For-All Really Graduate From the Magic Akademiya?"
::'''Aryadeva:''' I didn't expect my manuscript to be rejected again. Those Yae Publishing House editors are really strict...
:{{DIcon}} Please excuse me now...
::'''Aryadeva:''' If you want to join the society, just let me know.
