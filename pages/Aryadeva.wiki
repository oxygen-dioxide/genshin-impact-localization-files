{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aryadeva:''' Hello, I'm planning to set up a Light Novel Society. Are you interested?
:{{DIcon}} A Light Novel Society?
::'''Aryadeva:''' There are many societies in the Akademiya, but no Light Novel Society. It's strange, isn't it?
::'''Aryadeva:''' Light novels don't seem popular in Sumeru, but it is the Nation of Wisdom after all. There shouldn't be any gaps in our fields of knowledge.
::'''Aryadeva:''' I am not exactly a researcher of the Akademiya, but I am second to none when it comes to light novels.
::'''Aryadeva:''' Should we have an initiation ceremony or something like that?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...
::'''Aryadeva:''' I haven't studied in the Akademiya, but I'd like to consider myself a Herbad in the field of light novels.
::'''Aryadeva:''' However, there is no school in the Akademiya that awards diplomas in light novels.
::'''Aryadeva:''' That's why it's pertinent to have my book published by [[Yae Publishing House]]. My book's title is "Can a Trainee Combat Mage Whose Normal Attack Summons a Jinni that Will Start a Full-Out Free-For-All Really Graduate From the Magic Akademiya?"
::'''Aryadeva:''' I didn't expect my manuscript to be rejected again. Those Yae Publishing House editors are really strict...
:{{DIcon}} About the Kory Drums...
:;(Unlocks after completing [[Khvarena of Good and Evil]])
::'''Aryadeva:''' How did you hear about the Kory Drums? Did the [[Adventurers' Guild]] tell you?
::{{DIcon}} We're adventurers that specialize in solving particular problems.
::'''Aryadeva:''' Oh, well that's good to hear. If that's the case, there's a burden off my chest.
::'''Aryadeva:''' You should have already seen that fool child [[Nasejuna]], yes? The fact that you're standing here means that his plot failed.
::'''Aryadeva:''' Before, when Nasejuna asked me about the Kory Drums, I knew he was up to no good.
::'''Aryadeva:''' Hence, I deliberately hid the fact that I had one of the Kory Drums and entrusted it to an acquaintance I have in the Akademiya...
::'''Aryadeva:''' The glory days of the Order of Skeptics are bygone legends by now. Rather than harboring their dangerous delusions, {{sic|its}} better to see their desires manifest in light novels instead.
:{{DIcon}} Please excuse me now...
::'''Aryadeva:''' If you want to join the society, just let me know.
