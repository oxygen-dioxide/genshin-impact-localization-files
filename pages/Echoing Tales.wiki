==[[File:Item Echoing Conch.png|32px]] Echoing Conch==
The Echoing Conches scattered throughout the archipelago seal voices of the past within them. Gather these Echoing Conches to listen to various long-silent utterances that can be played back in the [[/Story|Conch Retrospection]], accessible via the Event menu screen. Collect enough of them to unlock rewards and obtain a precious treasure.

See the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/5?shown_types=182 Teyvat Interactive Map] or the Conch Retrospection page for locations.

* In the [[Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown|first act]], the islands are submerged. Only 5 Echoing Conches are available.
* Upon completing the [[Summer Vacation: Proceed With Caution|second act]], the islands have risen and 23 more Echoing Conches can be found.
* The final 4 Echoing Conches are made available after the [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait|third act]] of the event has been unlocked.
**If the echoing conch is interacted with before it is unlocked, it remarks "The conch carries the soft, distant sound of the waves."
