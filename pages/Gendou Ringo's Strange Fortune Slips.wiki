;(Read the ragged notes)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? What's this? Looks like someone's notes. Let Paimon see...
:'''Paimon:''' "... Shuumatsu... Fatui... plot against..."
:'''Paimon:''' What is this? It's a mess, and it's all covered in stains. Paimon can't really read it.
:{{DIcon}} Could be a clue to some treasure.
:'''Paimon:''' That makes sense! Let Paimon have another look.
:'''Paimon:''' "... when deciphering the slip, the secret code..."
:{{DIcon}} Deciphering the slip?
:{{DIcon}} Secret code?
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see! "...The first half is 'In the middle of a hazy night'..."
:'''Paimon:''' It cuts off here, and Paimon can't tell what the second half is.
:'''Paimon:''' But since it used a secret code, there must be some kind of secret to be found, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Either way, this seems important. Next time we decipher our fortune slip, let's try to match the secret codes, shall we?

;(Day 1)
;(Talk to Gendou Ringo)
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Hello.
:{{DIcon}} I want to decipher the fortune slip... <small>''(If holding a [[Bamboo Slip]])''</small>

::{{DIcon}} Nope... It's nothing, ma'am.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Goodbye.

;(If "(Hands over the fortune slip) In the middle of a hazy night." was selected)
:'''Paimon:''' Ms. Gendou's attitude is the same as ever, huh... Anyway, let's check the slip's contents.
:;(Opens [[Strange Fortune Slip]])
::Northland Devil: Fireblade Mourisu<br />Recently, a Fatui spy has been prowling the underground tunnels beneath Inazuma City.<br />This spy is plotting to disrupt the peace in the city and threaten the lands of Her Excellency, the Shogun.<br />Allegedly, the spy's name is "Mourisu."<br /><br />Send in the Shuumatsu to end traitors and criminals alike.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? This is...
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon gets it. This must refer to some bad guy who needs defeating!
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's gotta be it. So, Ms. Gendou, you're a secret agent who's using this method to communicate and wipe out those who try to harm Inazuma, right?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' You talk too much.
:'''Paimon:''' Welp! S-sorry! Please don't sic the "Shuumatsu" on us!
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Leave now.
:'''Paimon:''' We're leaving right now! Let's go to the place shown in the picture and see if we can find our target!
;(Obtain [[Strange Fortune Slip]] ×1)

;(After defeating the opponents)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that settles the mission Ms. Gendou gave us! Now, what sort of {{Color|buzzword|Fortune Slip}} will we draw next, eh?

;(Talk to Gendou Ringo)
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' When will that person come...
:{{DIcon}} Ms. Gendou...

:;(Obtain [[Strange Fortune Slip]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Ms. Gendou, you seem to be in a good mood today.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Hmm? What is it?
::{{DIcon}} You don't seem like your usual self...
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Oh? You think so? I'll take note of it.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Maybe I'm just in a great mood today... I mean, I just drew a "Great Fortune" slip and all! Just wanted to pay it forward, you know?
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Still, what some call "Great Fortune" might be "Great Misfortune" for others.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' For those who receive "great misfortune"... I wonder, what awaits them at the Fortune Slip Hanger?
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Ah, fortunes are so very interesting! See you later.

;(If "Ms. Gendou, you seem to be in a good mood today." was selected while holding a Bamboo Slip)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Paimon doesn't get what Ms. Gendou meant back there, but she really does seem a lot friendlier now.

;(If "(Hands over the fortune slip) In the middle of a hazy night." was selected; beginning of Day 2)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, that's weird. Ms. Gendou didn't call the fortune slips "strips of paper" today.

;(After defeating the opponents)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that settles the mission Ms. Gendou gave us! Now, what sort of {{Color|buzzword|Fortune Slip}} will we draw next, eh?

::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Huh? You mentioned it before, didn't you?
::{{DIcon}} Did I?
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Eh? You did. I mean, o&mdash;of course you did. Anyway, (Traveler) is a great name, isn't it?

;(If "(Hands over the fortune slip) In the middle of a hazy night." was selected; beginning of Day 4)
;(Investigating the point at Jakotsu Mine)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Looks like someone lit a fire here. Could it have been "Demonbane Kin"?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's follow the shoreline and have a look.

;(Approaching the beach)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What's that?

;(After defeating "Demonbane Kin")
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that settles the mission Ms. Gendou gave us! Now, what sort of {{Color|buzzword|Fortune Slip}} will we draw next, eh?

;(Investigating the spot where Gendou Ringo usually is)

:{{DIcon}} Well, this is slightly distressing...
:'''Paimon:''' Right? What if she doesn't return? How will Paimon know today's fortune?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? There's a slip here. Let Paimon have a look...
:{{DIcon}} We shouldn't...

:'''Paimon:''' Seems like we're to go to... this place and receive further instructions...?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go find out!
;(Obtain [[A Note Left by Someone]] ×1)

;(Approaching the bridge)
:'''Paimon:''' This is the place, right?
:'''Paimon:''' There's nothing special here...
:'''???:''' You showed up indeed, just as I expected.

:'''''You lose consciousness...'''''

:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Who are you, exactly, and what are your intentions?
:'''Paimon:''' That's our line! What were you doing, Ms. Gendou, attacking us like that?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' How rude. Answer my question.
:{{DIcon}} I'm (Traveler).
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Oh, I know your names, alright. Now, tell me. Where did you hear the secret code from?
:{{DIcon}} P&mdash;Paimon told me...
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, what are you saying!? Just tell Ms. Gendou what happened already! Can't you see the super scary look in her eyes?
:{{DIcon}} Please listen to me. This is how it happened...
:'''Paimon:''' We found an abandoned camp on a hill...

:'''''You recount the tale of the abandoned camp and the Tattered Notes...'''''

:'''Gendou Ringo:''' I see. So you chanced upon those notes. In that case, [[Momoka]] must be...
:'''(Traveler):''' Who's Momoka?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' She was the one who penned those notes, and she was a colleague of mine. Unfortunately, she will no longer be able to continue serving Inazuma. A true shame...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' I'm sure you must have many questions. I suppose it couldn't hurt to answer them.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Momoka and I are both ninja of the Shuumatsuban. Our task is to rid Inazuma of external threats, and these "strips of paper" are one of the ways in which we communicate our missions.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' As a result, we have also endured a lot of resentment and peril. For example, from those dangerous people who have infiltrated our nation...
:{{DIcon}} Mondstadters.
::'''Paimon:''' What do you mean Mondstadters!
::'''Paimon:''' We found an abandoned camp on a hill...
:{{DIcon}} Fatui.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' That's right.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' We use secret codes to identify our comrades.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' However, each person's secret code is unique. It seems that Momoka deliberately left her secret code behind in a bid to inform us of the situation.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' ...She was attempting to lure the enemy who would want to use that secret code out.
:{{DIcon}} So...
:'''Paimon:''' So you found out immediately, didn't you, Ms. Gendou?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Of course. That's why I had to ascertain the situation. But it truly was strange. I couldn't work it out.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' If you really were Snezhnayan spies, then why would you go and complete the missions as ordered without reporting the matter back to the Fatui?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' ...As such, I believe your story about the abandoned camp.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' From your actions, I can see that while you only matched the secret code up out of curiosity at first, you are friends and not foes of Inazuma.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's our name cleared &mdash; but Paimon's still a little peeved that you've just taken us for free labor this whole time, Ms. Gendou!
:{{DIcon}} ...Was that person really you though?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Hmph, I see you've noticed. Yes, the Gendou who gave you missions afterwards is an impostor.
:'''Paimon:''' What?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' As I was tailing you, I was set upon by some Fatui spies.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' I do know a thing or two about ninja arts myself, so I faked my death to fool them.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Afterward, they simply had one of their own people disguise themselves as me and replace me.
:{{DIcon}} No wonder she felt so off.
:{{DIcon}} No wonder she called the Fortune Slip by its proper name.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? So does that mean that the kind-hearted Ms. Gendou was a fake?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' "Kind-hearted"? Hmph, I suppose she's been quite popular, huh?
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Well, either way, they must've assumed that you were a formal member of the Shuumatsuban, and tried to use you to infiltrate our organization.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' This proved to be a good opportunity for me. While that impostor was out, I used methods of my own to bring you here.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Listen well. I shall now give you a choice.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Work for us as an external member. They do not yet know that I live, so the advantage is ours at present.
:{{DIcon}} What if I refuse?
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' You could certainly try.
::'''Paimon:''' Whatever the case might be, (Traveler), the Fatui are our enemies too! Why don't we work together?
:{{DIcon}} A reasonable suggestion.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' A wise choice. The supplies in this safe house are yours to use as you please.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Well then. I will be in touch in the event that something new comes up.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' May our cooperation be fruitful. Farewell.

;(Approach Gendou Ringo at the Grand Narukami Shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' (Hey, (Traveler)!)
:'''Paimon:''' (According to that Ms. Gendou, this Ms. Gendou is...)
:{{DIcon}} (Yeah, a Fatui knockoff.)
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Ah, we meet again. Want to check your fortune as well? Or...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' If you need a listening ear or if you have something to discuss, I can help too.
:{{DIcon}} We're just passing through.
:{{DIcon}} No, thanks!
:'''Paimon:''' Ms. Gendou is so friendly!
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Is that so? Hehe, that's what many people have told me lately. It feels good.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' It's always been my dream to work at a beautiful shrine like this.
:{{DIcon}} (Yeah, she's a Fatui knockoff.)
:'''Paimon:''' (Still, she seems like she actually enjoys this job.)
:{{DIcon}} (Don't let your guard down.)
:{{DIcon}} (Wait for Ms. Gendou to contact us.)
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' So, (Traveler), how may I help you today?
:{{DIcon}} I'm just here to see you.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Me... Huh? Ah? S&mdash;Sorry, I don't understand what you... what you mean...
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' P&mdash;Please allow me to cool down a little...
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' I get it now. Come find me if you have any questions.

;(Talk to Gendou Ringo again)
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Hello, (Traveler)! Are you here to decipher your fortune slip today?
:{{DIcon}} I want to decipher the fortune slip... <small>''(If holding a [[Bamboo Slip]])''</small>
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Okay, please give me your bamboo slip.
:{{DIcon}} In the middle of a hazy night.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Ah, I'm sorry. "No such thing" exists at the moment.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' You are so reliable... If only the F...
::{{DIcon}} Fatui?
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Uh... I mean, "If only I, the foolish Gendou Ringo, could witness your prowess in combat!"
::{{DIcon}} ...You will someday, don't worry.
:{{DIcon}} About the strip of paper...
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Oh, you mean the Fortune Slip? It works like this.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' First, you have to shake the Fortune Slip box till a Bamboo Slip falls out. Then, give me the Bamboo Slip and I will give the corresponding Fortune Slip to you.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' If it is an inauspicious fortune, you can knot it on the Fortune Slip Hanger to turn bad luck into good luck... That's about all there is to it.
::{{DIcon}} You know so much.
::'''Gendou Ringo:''' Well, after all, these are... the basic skills of a shrine maiden!
