|ja_note  = “むじむじ” (muji-muji) is a memetic word expressing the experience of feeling antsy yet largely frozen from worry, frustration, or irritation, particularly in describing the wringing of a person’s hands. It is also likely a play on the Japanese word for “badger” (mujina), an animal which Sayu is frequently associated with.
