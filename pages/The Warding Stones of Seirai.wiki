'''The Warding Stones of Seirai''' or Warding Stones are devices found on [[Seirai Island]]. Four of these stones seal the entrance to the center of the island, where the [[Thunder Manifestation]] resides. Each Warding Stone has three associated paper charm hangers, which have elemental traces leading to them that can be found with [[Elemental Sight]].

The Warding Stones are activated during the [[World Quest]] series [[Seirai Stormchasers]].
