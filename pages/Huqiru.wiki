:'''Huqiru:''' Ah, it's {{Traveler}}! Please, wait!
:'''Huqiru:''' Here you are...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh hey! Do you need help with something?
:'''Huqiru:''' Haha, not quite. I was just passing by with a package for the two of you. And there I was wondering how I'd track you down...
:'''Huqiru:''' Speak of the devil, or make that devils, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' A package! Who's it from?
:'''Huqiru:''' Well, it's had quite a journey. It first turned up in the Adventurers' Guild, then after changing hands many times, finally got picked up by the Scions of the Canopy's couriers...
:'''Huqiru:''' Considering Natlan's recent state of affairs, normal caravans haven't been up and running for a while. The sender didn't leave their name on the package, but judging by the signature... it seems to be from Fontaine.
:'''Huqiru:''' Seems like you've got friends all the way in Fontaine, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Received with thanks.
:{{DIcon}} Great! I'll take that off your hands, then.
:'''Huqiru:''' Whew, today's work sure is off to a great start. No sooner do I get the package than I run into its recipient. Praised be the Pyro Archon!
:'''Huqiru:''' Alright, I'm gonna go get more deliveries done. Have a good day!
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, good luck with your work!
:;(Huqiru leaves)
:'''Paimon:''' From Fontaine, huh... He called it a package, but it's so small! Looks more like a letter to Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's open it and see!

-->Dear {{Traveler}} and Paimon:<br><!--
-->It's been a while since you left Fontaine for Natlan. How have your travels been going?<br><!--
-->Word on the street says that they held a very special Pilgrimage this time. I'd love to have applied for a foreign press pass to come over and give you this photo too, but the Speaker's Chamber rejected The Steambird's applications &mdash; guess the Pilgrimage was just that special, huh? Anyway, we wound up getting Katheryne and the Adventurers' Guild to pass it on to you.<br><!--
-->With any luck, you'll receive it in time &mdash; and it wouldn't hurt for you to drop by Fontaine from time to time either. I'm sure everyone would be glad to have you.<br><br><!--
-->Your Faithful Friend,<br><!--
-->[[Charlotte]]

:'''Paimon:''' Oh, it's from Charlotte! It's the photo we took when we were [[Natlan! A New Adventure|leaving Fontaine]]...
:'''Paimon:''' It hasn't been that long since we took the photo, but it sure feels like forever!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, let's keep this photo someplace safe!
