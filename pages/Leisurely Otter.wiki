|description = A unique lifeform that lives in the water. Rumor has it that this creature has a deep phylogenetic relationship with the [[weasels]] that can be seen quite commonly on land. Its temperament is meek and indolent, and the rhythm of its existence is unhurried, bearing no sense of stress within its being.<br>When people encounter these languid otters, they often find these creatures floating with their backs facing the water, bringing both their paws together as a gesture of greeting. However, beneath their leisurely facade, they also possess a cleverness in their living, bearing enough intellect to use reefs to open up shellfish or mollusks in hopes of extracting delicious sustenance. Sometimes, after finding themselves stuffed from a massive meal, they won't need to forage for quite some time, allowing them to condense their eating habits into something best described as "stuff yourself lots now and rest lots more later."

'''Leisurely Otter''' is a [[Wildlife]] found underwater in [[Fontaine]]. 

If approached by the player, Leisurely Otters will follow the player around and perform tricks with a shell. Some Leisurely Otters are initially found trapped or cornered by monsters. If freed, they will lead the player to a [[chest]].

As of [[Version 4.0]], there are 11 Leisurely Otters found in the open world.

==Locations==

==Trivia==
* Using the [[Xenochromatic Creature|Xenochromatic Blubberbeast]]'s Sonar Waves ability on a Leisurely Otter will cause it to follow the player for a short distance. However, attacking it with other abilities will cause it to flee.
* [[Neuvillette]] estimates that there are over 6000 Leisurely Otters in Fontaine.
