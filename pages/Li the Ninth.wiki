==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Li the Ninth:''' When the taste of the finest wine doth flow through mine own throat, on springs of thoughts deep and divine, the strings of verse do float!
:{{DIcon}} Who're you?
::'''Li the Ninth:''' I... am Li the Ninth, a poet.
::'''Li the Ninth:''' People wax lyrical about the fine food served on the Pearl Galley. But I say that the wine is best!
::'''Li the Ninth:''' I've had many a cup, yet my thirst is not yet quenched. Each one is different from the last... a fine brew indeed!
:{{DIcon}} See you, then.
::'''Li the Ninth:''' Nothing more could a man as for, but on such fine wine to dine.
