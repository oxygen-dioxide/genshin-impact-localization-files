{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Guyun Stone Forest'''|zh=孤云阁|zh_rm=Gūyún-gé|zh_tl=Lone Cloud Pavilion}}|description=<p>It is an archipelago of seven large islands and smaller offshoots. The northernmost island houses the [[Geo Hypostasis]], and the island to the southwest holds the [[Domain of Guyun]].</p><p>According to legend, this is where [[Rex Lapis]] defeated a god and sea monster known as [[Osial]], and the jagged cliffs protruding from the islands at Guyun are in fact the remnants of the stone lances he used in that battle. It seems that those who spend the night at Guyun Stone Forest may experience Osial's memories of its defeat;<ref>{{Ref/Book|Diary of Roald the Adventurer|6}}</ref> whether this is caused by Osial's power or another phenomenon is unknown.</p>}}

===Ruins Treasure===
[[File:Location Guyun Stone Forest Ruins Treasure.png|alt=This map shows the location of a Ruins Treasure in Guyun Stone Forest.|thumb|Location of the first Ruins Treasure]]
On one of the southern islands is a Ruins Treasure. From a distance, you can see a pillar of light above it. This ruins treasure is related to the one in [[Mt. Aocang]], and tells the story of a disciple determined to vanquish all the monsters in the world.

====First Ruins Treasure====
''My fellow disciple and I trained in the martial arts from childhood. Our quest was to fight the forces of evil and protect all that is sacred in this world. But this was no easy task without the aid of a Vision.''<br />
''We two sought refuge here to train ourselves further and to seek the Visions that we desired. We erected this monument in testament to our endeavors.''<br />
<div class="dialogue">
:{{DIcon}} Touch the monument.
::*Reach the target location within 120 second(s).
::*The path will take you up the mountain and gliding through air rings to reach the next ruins treasure. The reward is a [[Chests|Common chest]].
:{{DIcon}} Leave for Now.
</div>

====Second Ruins Treasure====
''But now that my fellow disciple has obtained his Vision, instead of battling against monsters, he asked me, "Are monsters truly evil by nature?" So I replied to him, "They wreak havoc all across the world, and innocent people are the ones who must suffer the consequences. Is that so insufficiently evil that you should stay your blade?" I do believe an excess of meditation has fried his brain!''<br />
''Well, I still intend to take on these monsters &mdash; even if it means doing so without him, and even if it means doing without a Vision.''<br />
<div class="dialogue">
:{{DIcon}} Touch the monument.
::* Defeat 10 opponent(s) within 120 second(s) (0/10). Additional time will be gained after each kill.
::* Enemies:<br />Wave 1: [[Hilichurls|Hilichurl]] ×2, [[Hilichurl Shooters|Cryo Hilichurl Shooter]] ×1<br />Wave 2:  [[Hydro Slimes|Hydro Slime]] ×3, [[Cryo Slimes|Large Cryo Slime]] ×1<br />Wave 3: [[Rock Shieldwall Mitachurl]] ×1, [[Hilichurl Shooters|Cryo Hilichurl Shooter]] ×2
::*The reward is an [[Chests|Exquisite Chest]].
:{{DIcon}} Leave for Now.
</div>

====Third Ruins Treasure====
''Monsters are the bane of all that is worth living for in this world. Those of us who are skilled with the blade are duty-bound to hunt them out of existence.''<br />
''Monsters are evil! They deserve nothing more than the merciless slaughter they will get!''<br />
<div class="dialogue">
:{{DIcon}} Touch the monument.
::* Defeat all enemies within 120 second(s) (0/1).
::* Enemies:<br />[[Stonehide Lawachurl]] ×1
::*The reward is a [[Chests|Precious Chest]].
:{{DIcon}} Leave for Now.
:* Each Ruins Treasure disappears after the respective challenge is completed.

==Trivia==
* Some English character voice-over lines say "Guyun Tower," which is a more direct translation of its Chinese name, instead of "Guyun Stone Forest" as written in-game and on the voice-overs' official transcriptions.
