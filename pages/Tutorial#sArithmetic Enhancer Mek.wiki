|text1    = A machine created to complement the energy defects and increase the operational efficiency of clockwork meka. The {{Color|help|[[ousia]] or [[pneuma]]}} energies have different enhancive effects, and this machine can also periodically generate energy, allowing it to {{Color|help|replenish the power}} of nearby disabled clockwork meka that shares a similar energy source. After their energy is annihilated by {{Color|help|an attack charged with the opposite signature}}, it will induce an Overloaded state and cause the machine to lose energy, requiring the machine to spend time on Self-Repairs before it can restore its energy generation functions.
