{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Varesa)
:{{A|vo vrslq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you're here already!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 1 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yep, my dad whipped up something fantastic as always. He's a great cook! He can turn any protein or vegetable into something delicious.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder you look so refreshed! That's the power of a good meal!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 1 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, that's right! I was hoping to bring Uncle [[Acatl]] with me, but he wasn't home. So, I guess you're stuck with me.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 1 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Uncle Acatl is our chief, by the way! Who better than the chief to introduce you to the tribe, right?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 1 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I've never given an official tour before, so I'm thinking I'll just... explain things as we go along? Is that okay?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course! That sounds great.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 1 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Okay, whew... Then, let's start in... that direction!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' My place is over there! See that fruit stand out front? My house is right behind it.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You have a fruit stand in front of your house? Does that mean you grow the fruit yourselves?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, you guessed it! My family runs a huge orchard.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' We live really close to the main entrance of the tribe. So, every morning, I wake up to the sound of all the people and carts on the road.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That's also when my parents start work, so that's how I know it's time to get up.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And then you all work in the orchard together.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' W&mdash;Well... Knowing it's time to get up and actually doing it are two separate things.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Most of the time, I end up curling under the covers and falling back asleep.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets you! Sleeping in is the best kind of sleep.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 paimon 04a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo vrslq002 2 paimon 04b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Plus, when you have {{Traveler}} to wake you up, it's no big deal!
:{{DIcon}} Next time, I'm sleeping in, and you can wake me up.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no! That was just a joke, heh... Don't scare Paimon like that, {{Traveler}}!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hahaha, well, maybe you can both sleep in sometime.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Once I get up, I usually help my parents around the house, head out for training, then come home for lunch.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' After lunch is when my parents do their delivery runs, so then it's my turn to work in the orchard.
:{{DIcon}} That should be about now, right?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon would love to see the orchard! Can you show us?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 2 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Sure thing! We'll go right after this. But, first... come with me.

;(Talk to [[Iansan]])
:{{A|vo vrslq002 5 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Coach Iansan! Are you here to do some training?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 5 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Nope. Just doing some maintenance on the equipment here while I have some time.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 5 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oh, it's you two! Welcome to the Collective of Plenty!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 5 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Look! I bought this at the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame|Stadium]] the other day.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, we've seen that graffiti design before!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 5 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' It's not easy to get your hands on one of these! I had to wait in a super long line, haha.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 5 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Ooh, I bought a top with that design, too! I hung it up right next to my bed, hehe.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, that's me alright.
::{{A|vo vrslq002 5 varesa 03a 1.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Ooh, you should sign it for me sometime! It would mean the world to me!
:{{DIcon}} Ah... how embarassing...
::{{A|vo vrslq002 5 iansan 05b 1.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hahaha, don't be shy! After everything you did for [[Natlan]], you deserve the recognition!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 5 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oh, I meant to ask, what brings you out here, anyway?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're just doing some adventuring! We don't have any concrete plans.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We ran into Varesa on the road, and she was nice enough to lead us the rest of the way. She's even giving us a tour!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' It's my pleasure!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Still keeping up with your training, Varesa? No slacking, I hope...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yes, Coach! Did three full shuttle runs, just as you instructed, Coach!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Good. Then, we'll continue with the training plan... As for your diet... actually, no dieting for now. As you are.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 03.ogg}}'''Iansan:''' Feel free to use any of the equipment around here. But, if you're planning to do strength training, make sure you have a spotter.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Of course! Don't need to tell me twice, Coach!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but isn't a special diet a huge part of body-building? Varesa doesn't need one?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oh, it's kind of a long story... I suppose you could say Varesa is among the select few who have a natural gift.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' When she first started training with me, I started her on a standard training regimen and wrote out a simple recipe plan to give to her father.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' ...But, it left me so hungry, I couldn't even muster up the energy to make it to class.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yeah, that was my fault. It was just your average nutrition plan, but Varesa's metabolism is something else.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Once I studied her eating habits, I was able to tailor it to her needs.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, Coach is really thoughtful that way! Now, I feel like I'm making real progress, and the training and classes are a lot more fun!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Varesa is currently my top student... She can lift even more than me!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but... You're the coach! And a victor of the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame|Pilgrimage]]!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 09.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hahaha, don't sound so surprised. This kind of thing is really common in the fitness world. Everyone starts from a different baseline.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's amazing! Paimon would have never guessed...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 10.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I'm not exaggerating, either. Varesa is extremely strong. All she needs is a bit more confidence...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, well, it's just because Coach is a great teacher! Hehe, it didn't take much effort at all...
:{{DIcon}} Just further proof that you're a natural.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh believe me, I'm not. I mean, sure, I can face a few monsters and lift some heavy training equipment...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' But, I'm useless when it comes to fighting other people. I'm scared I'll hurt someone...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that makes sense... But, what about the Pilgrimage?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' *sigh* I've never placed, or even made it out of the team stage. I'm not good at fighting actual people.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 11.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' When it comes to power, it's all about control. Take these weights, for example.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 12.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' It takes strength to lift them, yes, but also to control the weight when you set them down. True mastery means control during both motions.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I know that, and I can do it just fine during training. But, whenever I have to face a real person, I start to doubt myself...
:{{DIcon}} It's alright.
:{{DIcon}} It'll come with time.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Thanks, I appreciate the support. As long as I keep training, I'm sure I'll get it eventually.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 12a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo vrslq002 6 varesa 12b.ogg}}--> '''Varesa:''' Well, we should get going, Coach. I told {{Traveler}} and Paimon I would show them around the orchard.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 6 iansan 13.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Sounds good. I hope you enjoy your time here!

;(Attempt to enter the orchard prior to this quest step, optional)
:{{Black Screen|As the [[Tatankasaurus]] on guard is strongly opposed, you have no choice but to leave...}}
:'''Vanana:''' Roohrr... Wroo!
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like that orchard's private property. That Tatankasaurus sure isn't letting anyone in there.

;(Talk to [[Vanana]] while indwelling a Saurian prior to this quest step, optional)
:'''Vanana:''' My job, protect Varesa's orchard. Sorry, thanks for understanding.
:'''Vanana:''' Some people good, some people bad. Sometimes hard to tell, so I use strength instead.
----
;(Talk to Varesa at the orchard)
:'''Vanana:''' Roar, roar...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Good girl, Vanana! Thanks for guarding the house! Now, let me take a good look at you &mdash; did you have another growth spurt?
:'''Vanana:''' Roar!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Haha, hey! I was just taking a look, not inviting you to wrestle! Next time, okay?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, this is Vanana. She keeps watch over the orchard when no one's here. She's a tough little thing, but also a clingy baby at heart.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, did you say... "little"? She certainly doesn't look it...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Anyway, this is my family's orchard. C'mon, I'll show you around.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, it's even bigger than Paimon imagined!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look at all the fruit! It looks delicious!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, this is the Collective of Plenty, after all. Being so close to the volcano makes the soil extra fertile. So, everything that grows around here is amazing.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Especially the fruit. We sell a lot to the other tribes, give some to family and friends, and keep the rest for ourselves.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if you have to live next to a volcano, at least you get something good out of it!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That's right! Since we're here, why don't we pick some and have ourselves a little snack!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but didn't you just eat?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, but there's always room for dessert! Plus, we don't have to pick that many... A few dozen should do it!
:{{DIcon}} A... A few dozen!?
:{{DIcon}} You really can eat a lot, huh...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Haha, you know that fruit stand in front of my house? Well, as a kid, whenever my dad was working at the stand, I would tug on his shirt and ask for a piece of fruit.
:<gallery widths="350">

</gallery>
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I would scarf it down in a heartbeat and then ask for another. Before long, people would gather around just to watch.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' My dad told me I made the fruit look so delicious, more and more people started coming to our stand. Which, of course, made me want to eat even more.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 12.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' The customers would ruffly my hair and say, "It's good to have a healthy appetite. You'll grow up big and strong, for sure."
<!--quest still image goes away-->
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 13.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I mean, what kid doesn't like a compliment? So, I would smile, which would get my dad to smile, and then my mom, too...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, that's so cute! Plus, free fruit whenever you want? Jealous!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 14.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' With all that said, it also helped that our fruit actually tastes really good! And, I'm not just saying that &mdash; you'll see what I mean in a minute!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 15.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, and there's an Epic Feast Showdown in a few days, so we're providing a bunch of the fruit for the desserts.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Epic Feast Showdown?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 16.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, sorry! It's basically a speed eating contest. We need to prepare a ton of ingredients.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 17.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' So, don't worry about anything going to waste! Okay, let's get picking!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Hmm, where should we start...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why is there a mushroom over there?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 18.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, that kind of mushroom? They kind of appeared out of nowhere when we first planted the orchard.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 19.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' They grow really fast and don't require any water or fertilizer. Oh, and the flavor is amazing!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 20.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You can grill them, stir-fry them, or even eat them raw! The flavor has almost a... fruity taste to it!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A mushroom that tastes like a fruit? That's a new one...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it absorbed nutrients from the nearby fruit trees?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 21.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, that could be! Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, if it tastes like a fruit, then it fits right in! Who cares where it came from?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 9 varesa 22.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Go ahead! Pick as much as you want! Might as well get some mushrooms, too, and I'll whip up something to eat!
----
;(During the challenge)
:{{A|vo vrslq002 10 varesa 02.ogg}} {{DIcon|Idle}} '''Varesa:''' Hmm, I'll grab some of this... And a few of these ♪

;(After completing the challenge)
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Whoa, that's quite the haul!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you need a bunch of ingredients for the eating competition, right? Thought we'd give you some help.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and you were right about the fruit! Paimon tried one, and it was one of the sweetest, juiciest pieces of fruit Paimon has ever had! You must sell out every time!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also Paimon tried one of the mushrooms, too! In a weird way, it really did taste like a fruit!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should call them "berryshrooms"!
:{{DIcon}} When it comes to food, Paimon's judgment never fails.
::{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon had multiple nations' worth of good food to refine her palate. Her tastebuds never lie!
:{{DIcon}} Every so often, Paimon knows what she's talking about.
::{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, wait... Something tells Paimon that's not a compliment...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Well, thanks to your help, we can call it early today. I promised you a meal, didn't I? I'll be right back!
:{{Black Screen|Before long, Varesa places a piping hot mushroom dish in front of you.}}
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I'm not the greatest cook, so it's nothing special. Still, high-quality ingredients are hard to mess up.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't sell yourself short! It looks great! Paimon can smell the "umami" from here!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! This is completely different from the raw taste!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, definitely two distinct flavors.
:{{DIcon}} I like them both.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, I'm glad!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' This kind of mushroom is a favorite in the tribe. But, it's not well-known outside the Collective of Plenty.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Actually, we're hoping to use the upcoming competition to introduce it to a wider audience. Uncle [[Atolli]] has been coming up with new recipes like there's no tomorrow...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hey, you two should sign up! Only if you want to, of course...
:{{DIcon}} What do you think, Paimon?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean the Epic Feast Showdown? ...Yeah! Paimon would love to sign up! She might not do very well, though...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Don't worry! You can tap out at any time. Nothing goes to waste. I'll take care of anything you can't finish.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good... Wait! Aren't you competing, too? Then, Paimon doesn't stand a chance!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You never know until you try! Besides, from what I just saw, looks like you can hold your own.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Anyway, winning isn't the point. Just think of it as an opportunity to try our local delicacies!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good point!
:{{DIcon}} Guess I'll tag along.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 11 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice! Then, let's sign up together! Time for Paimon to show these people what she's made of!

:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon wants to try one of these! Can she?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 paimon 03.ogg|1}} '''Paimon:''' 
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, it won't even budge... You can actually lift these things?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's amazing! Paimon would have never guessed...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that makes sense... But, what about the Pilgrimage?
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' This is where Coach Iansan lives. I heard there was some kind of incident at the Stadium, so she's not home right now.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' She asked me to do some upkeep on her equipment here, so we'll have to take a short break. It won't take long!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Sure is! It's all stuff Coach Iansan uses in her classes! She's taught me so much!
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' If I'm being honest, though, I don't understand much of the theory behind it. I just do whatever Coach Iansan says and reap the payoff, hehe... She's amazing.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Sure! Here, start with the lightest one.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, yeah! It's pretty easy, actually... Coach Iansan is ordering me custom weights because these are too light.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, well, it's just because Coach is a great teacher! Hehe, it didn't take much effort at all...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh believe me, I'm not. I mean, sure, I can face a few monsters and lift some heavy training equipment...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' But, I'm useless when it comes to fighting other people. I'm scared I'll hurt someone...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' *sigh* I've never placed, or even made it out of the team stage. I'm not good at fighting actual people.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Coach says, when it comes to power, it's all about control. Take these weights, for example...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 12.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' It takes strength to lift them, yes, but also to control the weight when you set them down. True mastery means control during both motions.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 13.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I know that, and I can do it just fine during training. But, whenever I have to face a real person, I start to doubt myself...
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 14.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Thanks, I appreciate the support. As long as I keep training, I'm sure I'll get it eventually. For now... I just need to wrap up this maintenance.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 8 varesa 15.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' And, done! Sorry for the wait. Let's go check out the orchard.
:{{A|vo vrslq002 10 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Go ahead! Pick as much as you want! Might as well get some mushrooms, too, and I'll whip up something to eat!
