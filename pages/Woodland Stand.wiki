|description    = A stand exquisitely handcrafted by the craftsmen at [[Acara Crafts]] based on the depiction of the [[Aranara]]'s homeland in fairy tales, with enough space to accommodate 6 "Aranara Carvings."<br />At first, only one such stand was crafted as a showcase. However, on account of the popularity of the woodcarvings and the eager requests of children, it soon went into mass production as well.<br />It is said that its selling price is lower than the production cost. Yet this is no pricing mistake, but rather a sales strategy.
