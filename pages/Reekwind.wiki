==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Reekwind is a Millelith that can be found pacing in Liyue's dockyard to look for his lost polearm. He used to be a slacker and gained the nickname "Reekwind" from his squad mates. When he finally quit being lazy, he became forgetful and lost his polearm and wallet. A copy of his message looking for his polearm can be found in [[Chihu Rock Bulletin Board]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Reekwind:''' Oh hi, traveler.
:'''Reekwind:''' I'm responsible for security in this district. Right now, I'm out on patrol... and I'm also looking for something.
:{{DIcon}} What are you looking for?
::'''Reekwind:''' I don't suppose you've seen a Millelith-issue polearm around here, have you?
::'''Reekwind:''' This is so strange... It must be around here somewhere...
::'''Reekwind:''' *sigh* If any of my squad mates find out, they're gonna give me another annoying nickname, I just know it...
::{{DIcon}} How does a soldier manage to lose his weapon?
::'''Reekwind:''' Shh... Don't let the sergeant hear. Look, it's not like I did it on purpose, okay?
::'''Reekwind:''' Believe it or not, I used to be a bit of a lazy slacker. Didn't care much for my appearance. Then, my squad mates starting calling me Reekwind...
::'''Reekwind:''' I managed to whip myself into shape, break the habit of a lifetime and quit being so lazy... But then, the forgetfulness took its place.
::'''Reekwind:''' Earlier today, I took a short break at that food stall over there. Kinda zoned out for a bit, and when I snapped back, I looked down and somehow there was a laundry pole in my hand... Not a clue where my Millelith polearm went...
::'''Reekwind:''' If my squad mates find out I managed to lose my polearm... Who knows what kind of awful new nickname they'll come up with?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I'm a bit busy.
::'''Reekwind:''' Alright, well... If you see a polearm around, let me know, will you? I'll pay you for your trouble.
::'''Reekwind:''' Wait... Where's my coin pouch!?
