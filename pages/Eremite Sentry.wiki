'''Eremite Sentry''' are [[NPC]]s located in [[Desert of Hadramaveth]], [[Sumeru]] encountered after completing {{Quest|Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III}}. They are parts of the [[Tanit]] tribe.

There are three Eremites guarding near the entrance to [[Bayt Al-Muazzam]], [[Bayt Al-Hayah]], and [[Bayt Al-Sukr]], three entrances leading to the [[Eternal Oasis]], respectively.

After completing ''[[For Her Judgment Reaches to the Skies...]]''{{verify}}, the sentries will disappear from their posts.
