==Profile==
Firecracker is the conductor of a band that regularly performs at the [[Calligraphy Tavern]]. When the [[Traveler]] first meets them, they are trying to help [[Stream]], their lead singer, recover his sense of rhythm after losing it to the Fading Disorder.

Firecracker is ambitious, hot-tempered, and holds the band to a high standard. This can make them seem rude and overbearing at times, but they ultimately want the best for others.

===Appearance===
Firecracker is an origami frog with an orange body that fades to yellow at the ends of their limbs. Their eyes are also orange, and they have a lotus leaf on their head.
