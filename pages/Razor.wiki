'''Razor''' is a playable [[Electro]] [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Abandoned as an infant, Razor was taken in by the [[Four Winds|Wolf of the North]], [[Andrius]], and raised by his wolf pack in [[Wolvendom]]. After a chance encounter with [[Varka]], the current Grand Master of the [[Knights of Favonius]] and the Knight of Boreas, he has slowly started integrating with humans again.
