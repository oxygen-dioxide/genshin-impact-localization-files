:'''Qiuwei:''' Hello, welcome.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you sell here?
::'''Qiuwei:''' You will need to pre-order silk and jewelry. Only some of the raw materials are in-stock items. Feel free to browse.
:;(Opens shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Qiuwei:''' This is the store authorized by the Liyue Feiyun Commerce Guild. In other words, this store has the permission of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to do business.
::'''Qiuwei:''' You can buy jewelry made of Liyue gems, and silk products made of Liyue specialties.
::'''Qiuwei:''' The silk and jewelry require time to be crafted, so please make a reservation if you need them.
::'''Qiuwei:''' In addition, you can also buy some of the raw materials directly from us.
::{{DIcon}} How's business?
::'''Qiuwei:''' Very good. The Sumeru people have their own unique style of weaving, but they also seem to like Liyue specialties.
::'''Qiuwei:''' The local Sumeru embroidery is very interesting, and the Feiyun Commerce Guild is trying to incorporate the characteristics of Sumeru textiles into their own products.
::'''Qiuwei:''' Well... Fortunately, this kind of cultural handicraft doesn't seem to be considered an intellectual product forbidden for export by the Akademiya, or it would be difficult for us to ship back samples.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Qiuwei:''' Take care, hope to see you again.
