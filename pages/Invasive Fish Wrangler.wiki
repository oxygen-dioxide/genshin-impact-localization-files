===Gameplay Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Invasive Fish Wrangler 1.png
|text1  = In "Invasive Fish Wrangler," you can work together with other players to catch fish in Co-Op Mode, or compete against them to see which of you is the better angler in Fish-Off Mode. {{Color|BP|You can obtain Wrangler Points in either mode}}, which will contribute to obtaining rewards.
|image2 = Tutorial Invasive Fish Wrangler 2.png
|text2  = Throwing out your fishing net costs action points. You can throw nets that have 3 different {{Color|BP|catch AoEs}} and action point costs. When the net touches the fish, it has a {{Color|BP|fixed chance}} of successfully catching said fish, which will net you action points according to the fish's size. The catch chance is affected by {{Color|BP|fish size}} and {{Color|BP|net type}}.
|image3 = Tutorial Invasive Fish Wrangler 3.png
|text3  = You have {{Color|BP|higher odds of success}} when using small, medium, and large nets to catch small, medium, and large fish respectively, with other methods being less likely to succeed. Use the right nets to catch as many fish as possible!
|image4 = Tutorial Invasive Fish Wrangler 4.png
|text4  = During the challenge, Anglertides will occur at intervals, during which {{Color|BP|many fish will gather}}. At these moments, super large fish that have both {{Color|BP|high capture difficulty and exceedingly high action point value}} will also appear. Do your best to net 'em!
