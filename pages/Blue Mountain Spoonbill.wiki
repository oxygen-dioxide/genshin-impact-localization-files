|description = A waterfowl with delicate blue feathers that often makes a quacking sound.<br>Legend has it that the feathers of the Blue Mountain Spoonbill could be used to make dyes, and of those, the quality of the dyes thus made from the plumage and tail feathers were astonishing, making them priceless at the time. The ancients of Natlan had to perform marvelous dances for the leader of the Blue Mountain Spoonbills, such that the entire flock would nod and allow them to take a single feather from the plumage and tail of each Blue Mountain Spoonbill. As such, the dancers often gathered together to learn from and compete with each other, which was one of the earliest forms of Natlan's "dance battling"...
