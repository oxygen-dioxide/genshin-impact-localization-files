==Personality==
{{Quote|A young man carrying a longsword who is frequently seen at book booths. He has a chivalrous heart and yearns for justice and fairness for all.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

To most people, Xingqiu appears to be a polite young man who takes his studies seriously, but he also has a more mischievous side to him. In the presence of close friends and family, he is gregarious and chatty, but shows more restraint than his elder brother. Unlike his older sibling, who is completely devoted to the guild's success, Xingqiu is more reluctant to do so, putting him at odds with his family.

He is good friends with [[Hu Tao]] and [[Chongyun]], though he pranks the latter consistently. He is an avid reader and spends most of his time looking for rare books at [[Wanwen Bookhouse]] when he is not preoccupied with his duties, writing his own books from time to time, with "[[A Legend of Sword]]" being one of his books. While it did not garner the popularity he wished for in Liyue, he is unexpectedly popular in [[Inazuma]] and [[Fontaine]] after an Inazuman merchant took the book back home with them; however, Xingqiu was initially unaware of its popularity in Inazuma.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Albedo|About Xingqiu}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Hu Tao|About Xingqiu}}</ref>

Being the second son of the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]], Xingqiu is extremely wealthy and possesses a significant amount of influence, although he only resorts to using the guild as backup if the situation cannot be handled otherwise. Wishing to become a real life embodiment of the heroes he reads in stories, Xingqiu has a strong sense of justice and was able to revitalize the [[Guhua Clan]] despite being one of its younger members. He despises those who resort to underhanded methods or badmouth chivalrous heroes. Despite his carefree personality, he is also intelligent, capable of rectifying problems in his own unique way and has done so in a manner that people simply give up arguing against him if he gets himself in trouble. He claims that when his older brother takes over, he would have to do all the work for him;<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xingqiu|Xingqiu's Troubles}}</ref> likewise, [[Yanfei]] has a positive view on him, as she was impressed by how he was able to keep up with her train of thought compared to the rest of his family.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yanfei|About Xingqiu}}</ref>

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Xingqiu has dark, navy blue hair with asymmetrical bangs and golden amber eyes. He has a slight frame and a light skin tone. He typically wears a blue earring with a gold tassel on his right ear. He is the only character who wears a single right earring. Other characters either have two earrings, a single left earring, or none at all. His vision is pinned to the bottom of the left side of his coat on top of a span of frilled, white fabric. A tassel made of amber which matches his eyes hangs from the vision.

His attire consists of a long coat of silk which gradients from black at the collar, to shades of navy blue as the material descends. The coat's underside is a contrasting yellow with a faint, wavy pattern decorating the fabric, alluding to his Hydro vision. His collar and shoulder plates are rimmed with a gold, metallic material and to the right side of his chest sits a large circular brooch. It's embedded with a blue jewel, alike the centre of his collar, coat buttons and sleeve cuffs (front and side). Underneath, Xingqiu wears a white long-sleeved shirt with a frilled seam to the right, revealed by the slit of his coat behind two overlapping ribbon-like buttons.

He additionally wields distinct, frilled sleeves which extend from his coat's baggy, gold pair. A clover-like ribbon of white, black and yellow is pinned to the right side of his belt. Beneath this hangs a pair of rectangular ribbons, one in white covering a notably longer, black ribbon. Both of them wield gold decals at their ends. He also wears a pair of navy-blue shorts with ends of black that are mostly concealed by the length of his coat. On his right leg, Xingqiu wears a garter with a blue tassel, just below the knee. His footwear consists of a pair of white high-calf boots, black at the heels and soles with gold motifs. His outfit, [[Azure Silk]], is described as fine robes woven from the high-quality silk sold by the Feiyun Commerce Guild.

{{Quote|Don't be fooled by his air and graces... He's a prankster to the core!|[[Chongyun]], speaking from firsthand experience}}

Second son of the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]], Xingqiu has had a reputation for being studious and polite ever since he was a young child. Parents in Liyue Harbor would speak adoringly of him, all secretly hoping that their own children would show as much promise as Xingqiu.

But even at a young age, mild-mannered Xingqiu had a wilder side too. Unbeknownst to his father and elder brother, he would sit for hours in the classroom reading fiction, having hollowed out used textbooks and snuck martial arts novels inside. After classes, he'd go out exploring and looking for all sorts of little ways to cause mischief.

Sometimes, his antics would even end up embroiling the Feiyun Commerce Guild in controversy. Luckily for Xingqiu, he always managed avoid blame by hiding behind an insurmountable wall of eloquent filibustering. Since no-one had quite what it took to beat him in an argument, eventually people simply learned to put up with his eccentricities.

An avid reader, Xingqiu's lifelong dream is to be the real-life embodiment of the chivalrous heroes from the pages of his books. For Xingqiu, chivalry is more than a standard of conduct &mdash; it's a mindset. The most chivalrous of all are not deterred by setbacks, nor do they stop to indulge their sense of satisfaction when things turn out as hoped. Instead, their minds are focused at all times on seizing the next opportunity to advance the cause of compassion and justice.

Despite his young age, Xingqiu has already mastered the chivalric code and cultivated the eccentric mindset that comes along with it. This gave him a knack for the style of martial arts practiced by the [[Guhua Clan]], and he gained some renown for effectively starting a Guhua renaissance. However, eager devotees who flock to the Guhua Clan's gates in search of the master himself may be disappointed to hear the gatekeeper's awkward response: "The master is off in the mountains taking some time to himself right now... Maybe try again another day."

I'll make sure the maids do the same."</p><p>Xingqiu had no idea what he was talking about. However, as his brother turned away, with a despondent look upon his face, he muttered to himself:</p><p>"Those books under his bed... No. No, I shouldn't go looking at what kind of books they are... Xingqiu is growing up after all... Don't want to be lecturing him all the time... Puberty perhaps?"</p><p>Afterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd. Expecting that one of the maids would have something to say about the stash of martial arts novels under his bed, he had long since prepared his response, but in the end, no one ever bothered to check his room again.</p>

There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan &mdash; they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.</p><p>Xingqiu's father was, of course, fully aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun; he thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.</p><p>He hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.</p><p>Xingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught to be exactly what he had hoped for.</p><p>Quicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.</p><p>He decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it would take him.

|text8         = <p>The martial arts school known as the Guhua Clan has been in decline for several hundred years now. In its heyday, the name of the Clan rang like steel throughout the harbor. It was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts &mdash; the ways of the "Light Piercer" for polearms, "Rain Cutter" for swords, and "Life Ender" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.</p><p>After many years, the Guhua Clan would finally get one in Xingqiu. It was he who successfully grasped the ancient "Martial Principle" after merely four years of study.</p><p>The Guhua weapon arts stress using the weapon as an extension of your body, and indeed this is a common idea amongst the various schools of martial arts in Liyue. But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial artists were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says that: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the "eye." </p><p>Having come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that "it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu." Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.</p><p>The verse reads thus:</p><p>Guhua's arts I have studied long, in its secrets I am trained, now its long-lost depths fall upon me like the coming of blessed rain.</p><p>The beating heart of Guhua's sword art is as a shower of floating flowers. One amidst may seize a bloom, but those without read only doom.</p><p>The Guhua lance is a lantern's dance, like flames in night's deep glooming. Like sparks, they scatter with ease in the dark, then join like the daybreak looming.</p><p>They say the sword is as your arm &mdash; I say its glint is the beholder's eye, a light like the bright dawn coming.</p><p>Those who wander are burdened not. Freely they cut rain, and enlightened they pierce light. Like a snaking dragon, they cannot be subdued. In their right eye the blade, and in the other the spear.</p><p>This text should have been free for all to read. The only reason why it was sealed is the dreadful handwriting.</p>

==Trivia==
* Xingqiu's handwriting is extremely messy to the point that most people have difficulty understanding it:
** The Guhua head had to lock up his verse on the "Martial Principles" because he did not want anyone else to see the dreadful writing.
** When Xingqiu hands a note to the Traveler to bring to the Feiyun Commerce Guild, Paimon notes that she can't understand it while the Traveler believes it to be from an ancient script or a secret text requiring a cipher.
** The [[Yae Publishing House]] considers his signature to be quite the "tortured thing" to the point that without careful observation, it could be mistaken for part of the pattern on the box set's lid.
** The [[Stone Gate Bulletin Board]] has a message from Xingqiu, which the Traveler can no longer decipher after a few words.
** On the [[Qingce Village Bulletin Board]], one message mentions an "urbane swordsman" bringing more books to the village, with extremely messy notes scribbled inside. [[Granny Ruoxin]] interprets them as exorcist symbols.
** Xingqiu left an anonymous message on the [[Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board#O|Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board]]. The reply to it was likely written by [[Xu]].
* Xingqiu is the secret author of the novel "A Legend of Sword".
** The novel is a big hit in [[Inazuma]] and has also gained traction in [[Fontaine]].<ref name="Gaiman">{{Ref/NPC|Gaiman}}</ref>
** [[Albedo]] is the illustrator for "A Legend of Sword".<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xingqiu|About Albedo}}</ref>
* Xingqiu shares actresses with other characters across the various voiceover languages:
** His English voice actress, Cristina Vee Valenzuela, also voices [[Bennett]].
** His Korean voice actress, Gwak Gyu-mi, also voices [[Ningguang]].
** His Chinese voice actress, Yajing Tang (唐雅菁), also voices [[Beidou]].
* Xingqiu is the first [[Characters|playable character]] to appear in a non-event [[World Quest]] ([[Yae Publishing House's Invitation]]).
*Xingqiu is the only Character that wears his Vision backwards.
*Xingqiu is seen wielding the [[Silver Sword]] in his wish art.

===NPCs Mentions===
*Xu reveals that Xingqiu is in charge of Feiyun Commerce Guild's silk trade (which possibly also alludes to his ascension material) - however Xingqiu often disappears from his duties which causes Xu to worry.
*[[Gaiman]] indirectly mentions him while speaking about "A Legend of Sword."
*[[Musheng]] reveals that Xingqiu once saved his life from bandits.
*[[Sun Yu]] and [[Little Que'er]] are his senior disciples within the Guhua Clan, though he exceeded them at a much younger age. Sun Yu mentions him in his dialogue.
* During the [[Fleeting Colors in Flight]] event, [[Little Zuo]] calls Chongyun and Xingqiu as weirdos who always go to [[Qingce Village]] discussing "evil spirits" and assumes that they are writing a story.

===Furniture Mentions===
* [[Calligraphy Set: Assiduous Calligraphy]] refers to Xingqiu as the "second young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild." According to him, people from outside Liyue have trouble imitating Liyue's traditional art style due to a lack of experience, purity, and a certain "strength of character."

===Etymology===
*His constellation, Fabulae Textile, is Latin for "Woven Stories."
*Xíng (行) means "travel" (has the connotation of drifting) and qiū (秋) means autumn. Placed together, Xingqiu's name could mean something like "the gentle progression of autumn".
*The first half of Xingqiu's name 行 (''xíng)'' could be derived from the Chinese saying 行云流水 (''xíng yún liú shuǐ'') (lit. "moving clouds and flowing water") which refers to beautiful handwriting. Ironically, Xingqiu himself has really bad handwriting.
*Xingqiu published ''[[A Legend of Sword]]'' under the penname {{Lang|Zhenyu|zh=枕玉|zh_rm=Zhěnyù}}.<ref name="yphi" /> Prior to Version 2.2, another penname of Xingqiu is {{Lang|Chenqiu|zh=沉秋|zh_rm=Chénqiū||ja=沈秋|sort=zh,ja}},<ref name="Gaiman" /> mentioned by Gaiman. This proved to be the inconsistency of Xingqiu's penname when the World Quest Yae Publishing House's Invitation had been released in Version 2.0. As of Version 2.2, the pen name was retconned to be the latter version and the name Chenqiu was removed.
**In "Chenqiu," 沉 and 沈 both mean "to submerge/sink/immerse in", referring to Xingqiu's immersive interests in martial arts. {{Lang|mini=1|zh=秋|zh_tl=autumn}} is the same character for the second syllable of his given name.
** "Zhenyu" means Pillow of Jade, alluding to his hometown Liyue. It is a homonym of {{Lang|mini=1|zh=阵雨|zh_rm=Zhènyǔ|zh_tl=rainshower}}, which alludes to his skillset.
