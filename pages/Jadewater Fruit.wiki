'''Jadewater Fruits''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Fontaine]] currently found in the [[Liffey Region]] and [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region]].

Jadewater Fruits are {{Hydro}} objects and can be destroyed using elements that [[react]] with Hydro. As it is being attacked, it may spew out [[Bubble]]s that can entrap the player. Some of these bubbles will appear next to the fruit or directly under player. Before a bubble is about to appear, the ground below will be illuminated.

After the fruit is destroyed, it will typically spawn a [[Chest]], an enemy that when defeated will spawn a [[Chest]], a [[Mora Chest]], or in rare cases it may only give some miscellaneous items.
