|description = These floofy, furry four-legged camelids are elegant and gentle, and get along very well with humans, just like good partners who understand one another...<br>Although they look very different, this animal is indeed a distant relative of the [[Sumpter Beast]], and is also of some relation to the Fluff-Fleece Goat. Good at carrying goods over long distances, they are a merchant's best friend. When it's time to rest, you can even snuggle up against them to enjoy a soft, sweet sleep...<br>Generally speaking, alpacas grow fleece very fast. In order to prevent them from being knocked flat out by the hot climate, people have to trim the alpacas every once in a while. As fortune would have it, the wool made from their fleece is also a superb material for making cloth...

'''Alpaca''' is a type of [[Wildlife]] found in [[Natlan]].

Alpacas will not flee when approached. They have a health bar that can be seen when attacking them, but doing so or unsuccessfully using an [[Omni-Ubiquity Net]] on one will cause them flee and disappear in a few seconds.
