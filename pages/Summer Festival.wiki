The '''Summer Festival''' is a festival that is celebrated in [[Inazuma]]. [[Naganohara Fireworks]], the company owned by [[Yoimiya]], provides the [[Naganohara Fireworks Show|firework show]] for this festival. The [[Traveler]] experiences the Summer Festival during [[The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit|Act I of Kamisato Ayaka's]] and [[Dreamlike Timelessness|Act I of Yoimiya's]] Story Quests.

==Trivia==
* The [[Retracing Bolide]] Artifact Set tells the story of a person witnessing the Naganohara Fireworks Show during the Summer Festival. The person also met a [[Kitsune Saiguu|fox-eyed woman]] while watching the fireworks. That woman also said that this was the best spot to watch fireworks (possibly referring to [[Amakane Island]]).<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Retracing Bolide}}</ref>
