'''Sakujirou''' {{Lang|ja=朔次郎}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in [[Yoimiya]]'s [[Story Quest]], "[[Dreamlike Timelessness]]."

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Sakujirou is originally from Inazuma, but left due to it being too peaceful, and him wanting to see the outside world. He then snuck back in after the [[Sakoku Decree]] took effect, due to him regretting his decision and wanting to make up for past mistakes. This caused him to be chased by the [[Tenryou Commission]], having to take refuge in [[Naganohara Fireworks]] until safe for him to leave. He used to be childhood friends with [[Imatani Keisuke]], until they had a fight and stopped talking.
