==Albedo==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It is well worth exploring this domain thoroughly, though it will take some time. Approximately as long as it would take to read an entire alchemy book from cover to cover, in my estimation.
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Perhaps I could assess each threat that awaits us, quantify the total effort required in each case, and... Hmm? From the look on your face... You wish to continue the battle now, correct?
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Then let's go. Remember to make each move count, and be ready to change strategy at a moment's notice.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I was reading an alchemy paper recently, and was particularly interested by the section on Targeted Integration of Hidden Effects of Composite Alchemical Ingredients.
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Some details of the experiment weren't expounded on in full, although I was able to follow along and bridge most of the gaps. But I'm keen to learn more about what happens during the actual mixing stage. I'll have to take the time to recreate the entire experiment in full, then I can observe it for myself.
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh, you'd like to watch, too? Certainly. I'll let you know when I plan to conduct the experiment.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It is rather pleasant here, far away from all the commotion. We needn't be in a hurry to leave.
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I would offer to paint your portrait since we have some time on our hands, but unfortunately I don't have my new palette on hand.
:{{A|vo albedo saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Hmm... I suppose I could peruse one of the books here. Reading is a fine way to calm the mind.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Alhaitham==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Having a challenging mid-to-long-term goal is a good thing.
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' This applies equally to combat, job-seeking, and the pursuit of knowledge.
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' But what people get out of achieving their goal depends on the individual.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Quite a few books.
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Storybooks, mostly. A rare sight in the House of Daena &mdash; they claim it would distract the students from their studies.
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' But if the fate of a student's studies depends on externally imposed restrictions, whether to storybooks or otherwise, they won't make it far in academia.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Rest time, you say?
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Mm. Then let's give our vocal cords a rest.
:{{A|vo alhaitham saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Grab some coffee, and spend some time thinking about the things you're usually too busy for.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Amber==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You know that magical bird I told you about? The one I spent three days hunting? I still wear the feather I took as a trophy on my waist.
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' There's nothing like finally defeating your enemy after a long, hard battle. It's like biting into a delicious steak when you're starving hungry!
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' So, whatever happens &mdash; don't give up!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I've had times when I wished that one day, I'd wake up to find Baron Bunny had come to life and could talk.
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Y'know, like Oz, Fischl's raven. They get to go adventuring together, and can even split up on missions when they need to.
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Still, Baron Bunny's already a huge help. Besides, if I want to become the best outrider ever, it's me I gotta focus on!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' What do you think we'll find if we go further in? I'm excited to see.
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I know, everyone needs to rest after the last battle... But I'm an Outrider. I'm not used to standing around waiting.
:{{A|vo ambor saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Make sure you don't forget to call me when you're ready to leave!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Arataki Itto==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo itto saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Look, even if there are a couple o' tough customers lurking around this place, what's there to worry about when you've got Arataki "Numero Uno" Itto on your side, huh? Huh? Haha, there is nothing out there that you need to be afraid of.
:{{A|vo itto saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Let's see who actually has the guts to face me. A couple o' whacks from my club will send 'em all running back whence they came! WAPOW! ...And if not, we'll let Ushi deal with them.
:{{A|vo itto saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ugh, anyway, no use fighting on an empty stomach. Hey, they do food here, right?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo itto saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahaha, these books are actually pretty good. I bet the boys in the gang would enjoy reading 'em, too.
:{{A|vo itto saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh? ...Fairytales? You mean... they're meant for kids?
:{{A|vo itto saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ahem! Uhh, what I meant was, we should totally share these books with the kids in the city! They'd be a smash hit with them!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo itto saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Alright, {{Traveler}}, who we gonna throw down with next? I'm ready to rumble!
:{{A|vo itto saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' What are we waiting for, anyway? C'mon, let's gooo! Or they'll start thinkin' we're scared of 'em!
:{{A|vo itto saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh, but I guess you need some time to organize the victory feast, right? Gotta plan ahead for these things! ...Okay yeah, we can hang around here a little longer. Good thing I got this lollipop to tide me over.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Arlecchino==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' The enemies we face are of a lowly breed. Deal with them however you see fit.
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' But do not get complacent. You should expect to fend for yourself, as I am not in the habit of coming to other people's rescue.
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' If you do encounter a foe for whom you are no match, simply make yourself scarce, and I shall deal with it in due course.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' Before I go on a long journey, I tend to leave the children of the House of the Hearth with some homework to complete in my absence.
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' Many of them, however, simply play to their hearts' content for most of the time I am gone, then rush to get their homework done in the final few days before my return.
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' They believe I am none the wiser, but I have simply elected not to expose their chicanery. After all, to complete one's work in a short timeframe is a skill in its own right.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' You intend to take a rest? I concur. You do look quite tired.
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' Self-knowledge is a good trait to have. Better to walk at a slower pace if it means you will travel further in the end.
:{{A|vo arlecchino saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Arlecchino:''' I brought some coffee candies. Here, take one.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Baizhu==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo baizhu saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' *cough*... *cough*
:{{A|vo changsheng saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Hey, are you sure you can keep going? Maybe we should take things a bit more slowly?
:{{A|vo baizhu saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...It's nothing serious. If I let every little setback stop me, I'd never have made it this far.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo baizhu saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' There are a surprising number of books here. I can't help but wonder if there are any ancient prescriptions or medical texts...
:{{A|vo changsheng saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Sorry to disappoint, but I already took a look. They're pretty much all children's books.
:{{A|vo baizhu saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Is that so... Well, some fairytales may still have therapeutic benefits in treating mood-related disorders.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo baizhu saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' This place is truly perilous, {{Traveler}}... Do you have any injuries or concerning symptoms you'd like to tell me about?
:{{A|vo baizhu saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Yes, I know you're very skilled, but just because you're not black and blue doesn't mean everything is okay. If you're not careful, fatigue will accumulate over time and catch you unawares. You must remember to stretch to relieve tension and ensure good circulation of your qi...
:{{A|vo changsheng saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' ...Or to put it bluntly, he's worried about you! So just lie down and let us give you a quick checkup.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Barbara==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I don't like it when people around me get hurt. It's so upsetting to see them in pain...
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' But sometimes in life, fighting is inevitable. All I can do is pray, and support everyone from behind by patching up the injured...
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' And I have to do it with a smile, if only to keep people's spirits up.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' A squirrel, a fox, and a cute kitty-cat...
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I'm trying to write a heartwarming song with a fairytale theme, but it's a little tough...
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I think I need to go back to the story books and look for some more inspiration!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Are you injured at all? Rest here, let me give you a full examination.
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Just a scratch? Ooh, you shouldn't say that! No matter how minor your injury, you mustn't ignore it.
:{{A|vo barbara saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I won't take up too much of your time, I promise!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Beidou==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' There's some pretty tough cookies lurking around in here, huh? Still, nothing to be scared of.
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' If you're out on stormy seas and a giant wave is coming towards you, you only put yourself at risk of capsizing if you try to steer around it. But if you face it head on and take it on the bow, you can split that wave down the middle.
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'm used to taking the helm when the storms come. So when we head into battle, feel free to put me up front!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' There's a lot of stories about me floating around in Liyue, but I guess the most well-known is the one about me defeating Haishan.
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'm ashamed to admit it, but I went into that fight with a huge ego. I thought I'd seen it all and wanted to show people that I could take on the world... Little did I know it would very nearly cost me my life.
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Ultimately, I still dealt the final blow. But in the end, what got me through it wasn't my arrogant desire to prove myself. It was the fact that I had a whole crew behind me that I cared about a lot.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Since we've got some time on our hands, do you wanna take a seat and shoot the breeze for a bit? I brought some drinks if you're thirsty.
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' With me here, we can take whatever this domain has to throw at us.
:{{A|vo beidou saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' There's no point spending all your time worrying about what lies beyond the horizon. If it's a sunny day, you can snooze away, and if there's dark clouds ahead, you just gotta roll up your sleeves and sail on through the storm! That there is the secret to living a happy life.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Bennett==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' These monsters are stronger all the time... Probably 'cause I'm on the team, I bet.
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' But the good news is, as the leader of Benny's Adventure Team, I've learned a lot about how to draw monsters' attention!
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I'll lure them out, and once they charge at me, you guys wait for the right moment to take 'em all down!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I've always wanted to go off on a big, long adventure, and grow old along the way, just like my dads.
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I know there's a lot of bad luck waiting for me out there, and if I'm not careful, I might not have the chance to grow old at all...
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' But my mind's made up. I have to do it! Because... adventuring is my favorite thing!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' If it's okay with you, I think we should check all the pillars in this room, just to make sure they're sturdy.
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' If I spend too long in one place, sooner or later... accidents happen.
:{{A|vo bennett saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' It's not me I'm worried about. But if I'm gonna keep on adventuring with you, we gotta make sure everybody else is safe.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Candace==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo candace saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' I will show no mercy to any who threaten my companions.
:{{A|vo candace saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' So, whatever evils dwell within this domain, you need not fear. My spear and my shield are at your command.
:{{A|vo candace saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' That is my duty as guardian.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo candace saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' At the core of any myth is a true story, but once a story comes to bear the hopes and dreams of an entire people, fantastical fictions inevitably become mixed in with the truth.
:{{A|vo candace saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' But in my view, the truth of our myths is not important. Still I will stride the golden sands, my heart yearning for the light of dawn.
:{{A|vo candace saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Whether with or without the blessing of the gods, I will always be the guardian who protects my people.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo candace saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' I just had a brief look around. I quite like that hat on the coat rack... It's a nice color, and pretty stylish too.
:{{A|vo candace saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' I would've quite liked to try it on if this was a marketplace...
:{{A|vo candace saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' But since it probably counts as lost property, I'll have to be content to admire it from afar.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Charlotte==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ooh, are you going further in? Take me with you! Please?
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I'm sure there'll be plenty of challenges for us to face...
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But if there's a chance of discovering the truth behind this place, it'll definitely be worth the risk.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' According to my interviews, this Domain might be related to a famous author of fairy tales.
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Are the stories supposed to be an analogy for something? What clues could lay hidden in those pages?
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, I'd love to meet one of the writer's descendants &mdash; I have a looong list of questions for them here in my notebook!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I wonder what secrets could be hidden within this Domain.
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I mean, I know we're supposed to be having a break, but I couldn't call myself a professional journalist if I let the mysteries here go unexplored!
:{{A|vo charlotte saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Good thing I've got my notebook with me. Hey, maybe I'll be able to land an interview with the person in charge!

{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chasca saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' What are all these shiny things on the ground? Can we... take some with us?
:{{A|vo chasca saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' They look like they'd make great bedside ornaments. I'm sure "Mom" would like 'em too.
:{{A|vo chasca saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Though with that many spikes, it might be better to leave them out of the lair. Sounds like a recipe for an awful night's sleep...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chasca saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We sure burned through a lot of ammo back there... Ha, my gun's still hot to the touch.

{{Dialogue End}}

==Chevreuse==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Proceed with caution, assess the situation, fire on command, and shoot to kill. Clear rules and a battle plan are essential to any military operation.
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Sticking to these rules while we're exploring this domain will guard us against a lot of preventable accidents.
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...But of course, if things escalate out of control, I will act as the last line of defense to secure you enough time to make a decision on how to proceed.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I know all these books are meant for children, but some of the stories are actually quite good.
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Here, for example. This one's the story of two parrots that sue each other. Each accuses the other of stealing a poem that they both claim to have written that morning.
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But since they only know how to imitate speech, the judge has no way of knowing who actually wrote the poem first... Such a fun story. Any chance I can borrow it?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' We're gonna rest and regroup? Good. A wise decision.
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' There's no telling what awaits us next. It's crucial that we take every opportunity to recover our strength.
:{{A|vo chevreuse saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You should go hydrate &mdash; I'll handle the weapon maintenance. Once I'm done, they'll be good as new.

==Chiori==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chiori saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I see a lot of people training in the art of the sword to pursue martial excellence. But that's not my goal.
:{{A|vo chiori saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I'm only interested in capturing the aesthetics of the sword, especially the interplay between light and shadow. Combat, for me, is a chance to get a wealth of inspiration in the bag.
:{{A|vo chiori saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But don't worry. Even if I lose focus mid-battle, Tamoto will help you out.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chiori saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I like the decor here. Seems like working in a different environment once in a while can be a good mood-booster.
:{{A|vo chiori saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Only thing is, once I get into work mode, I'm so focused on what I'm doing that I don't pay much attention to what's going on in the outside world.
:{{A|vo chiori saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' So if you need me for anything, you'll have get up close and personal to get my attention. Got it?

==Chongyun==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' The deeper we delve, the stronger the enemies we find. This domain is certainly a very dangerous place.
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But in my view, if someone is called to exorcise the forces of evil and defend the good in the world, then settling for the low-hanging fruit falls far short of their mission. A serious exorcist must be willing to take the fight to the most powerful foes.
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Today, I fight side-by-side with you. There is no evil we cannot overcome.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I heard that some of the stories in these books talk about completely made-up beings, but with incredibly life-like illustrations...
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Do you think the author drew them purely from their imagination? I'd love the chance to learn from them if so.
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If I had that kind of skill, the Field Guide to Demons and Beasts wouldn't be in the sorry state it is now...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Whenever I get out of a fierce battle and I'm still fired up, I take a moment to sit quietly and perform some breathing exercises. It helps stabilize my qi.
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I do it because of my pure-yang spirit. But I believe the practice can offer similar benefits to other people.
:{{A|vo chongyun saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' So do take a proper rest between battles. I'm sure it'll do you good.

==Citlali==
===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo citlali saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Keep going. Whatever challenges lie ahead, you'll make mincemeat of them.

:{{A|vo citlali saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' What about me? My role is to be your loyal and dedicated assistant, of course. Why else would I leave the comfort of my home?

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo citlali saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Since the fate of the Tzitzimimeh has been obscured, they can't operate at their full strength here. But the good news is, our current proximity to the Ley Lines has enhanced my own abilities.
:{{A|vo citlali saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Just what is this place? It's truly full of mysteries...
:{{A|vo citlali saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Well, I have all the time in the world, so I might as well find a free corner and move all my stuff in. Then I can start trying to figure out what all of this really means...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===

:{{A|vo citlali saferoom rest 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You should take a break. Do you need a drink? A pillow, maybe a light novel...? Don't be shy... Really, you're sure you don't want anything? Heh, you're so low-maintenance...

:{{A|vo clorinde saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' The truth, however, is just the opposite. It is the spirit of the challenger that I value above all else. If someone is willing to face me head-on, they have my respect, no matter who secures the title of victor in the end.

:{{A|vo cyno saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I've always thought of books as one of the great inventions.
:{{A|vo cyno saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Once a law is written down and compiled into a legal codex, it no longer exists only in the words spoken by the lawmaker. It has its own independent existence. Only then does the ability to exercise true judgement arise.
:{{A|vo cyno saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Because all people must be judged equally. Even the lawmakers themselves.

:{{A|vo dehya saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' And so, he's forced to spin ever more ludicrous lies to keep himself alive and keep the Mora rolling in... Hahaha, you know what? I'll read on &mdash; this looks pretty fun.

{{Dialogue End}}

===Small-Talk===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo diluc saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I had a phase once where I did exactly what you're doing now. Constantly exploring dangerous domains and confronting powerful enemies.
:{{A|vo diluc saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' But what drove me to do it wasn't any of the rules from the Knights of Favonius Handbook. It was my personal convictions.
:{{A|vo diluc saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Conviction helps you rise above your wounds and fatigue, and guides you forward into the light of dawn.

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}

===Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo dori saferoom challenge 01.ogg}} '''Dori:''' What's that, you say? I could have sworn I just heard you invite me to go monster-fighting in this domain with you... Strange, I slept perfectly well last night. Why am I having auditory hallucinations?
:{{A|vo dori saferoom challenge 02.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Dori Sangemah Bay is just a straightforward businesswoman. So let me put it to you this way: Why would any businessperson take such a huge gamble on their own life unless there was, oh I dunno... a few dozen million Mora to be made?
:{{A|vo dori saferoom challenge 03.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Here's my counter-offer: A custom-made Domain-Delver's Survival Kit, just for you! Great value for your Mora, and available at a discounted price for a limited time only!

:{{A|vo dori saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Dori:''' If there really was such a thing as a miracle potion that could cure all disease, I'm sure it would be auctioned off and sold for an astronomical price.
:{{A|vo dori saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Dori:''' But in this fairytale, the fairy gives her magic potion to the prince for free. She has no business sense at all.
:{{A|vo dori saferoom others 03.ogg}} '''Dori:''' *sigh* If you want my opinion... Praying to a fairy isn't the answer. Better to go out and make some Mora.

:{{A|vo emilie saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Emilie:''' I tend to find that distracting the mind by focusing on something else is an excellent way to relax. We could chat about today's news stories, for instance.

:{{A|vo eula saferoom others 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' What will become of the wicked aristocracy after being ousted by the valiant knights?
:{{A|vo eula saferoom others 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Will they flee into the dark woods while the nation rejoices, wallowing in self-pity? Or will they beg for mercy, only to skulk in some corner of the city, sharpening their knives?

{{Dialogue End}}

===Resting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo eula saferoom rest 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' There's no rush to get to the next battle. It's critical to fully recover your strength if you want to stand the best chance of securing victory.
:{{A|vo eula saferoom rest 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Why don't we take some time to review the enemy threat and fine-tune our plan of attack?
