<section begin="possibly kusanali voice" />
* During ''[[Immernachtreich Apokalypse (Part 3)]]'' and ''[[Like Rhyme and Song, the Summer Reverie]]'', the unknown entity that the Traveler speaks to through the [[Dodocommunication Device]] and telepathically is strongly implied to be the {{Dendro}} [[Archon]] {{No Selflink|Lesser Lord Kusanali}}:
** The entity hints that the player will meet them at some point in the near future.
** After the entity finishes speaking to the Traveler for the last time, a {{Dendro}} elemental symbol briefly appears in front of the Traveler.
** The entity seems to have the same voice as the one teased at the end of the [https://youtu.be/OBzQlqcH4J8?t=1925 Version 2.8 Special Program] during the new region preview. (This is true across Chinese, English, and Korean, the only voiced languages with a Special Program.) This voice also sounds the same as the voice of [[Nahida]] (Lesser Lord Kusanali).
** Sumeru, the nation of {{Dendro}}, was the next playable region after this event's story.
** Despite the fact that the Dodocommunication Device was made by [[Alice]] and was only meant to allow communication between the [[Traveler]] and [[Venti]], this entity somehow not only cuts off that link but also commandeers it.
** [[Persikov's Manuscript]] revealed that the [[Fatui]] machine, which caused the mirages and hallucinations experienced by the party and the Fatui, was modeled after the power of a God (Archon).
** The entity admits they helped "design a little something" for the Traveler and friends, referencing the machine and/or the mirages.
** Additional connections that aren't as direct:
*** A "mirage" of knowledge is mentioned in ''Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail'' for [[Sumeru]]. However, the original Chinese text uses a word for "bait" instead of "mirage."
*** The Version 2.8 Special Program showed a [[Statue of The Seven]] that appears to depict a child. While it is unknown whether Statues of The Seven depict current or previous Archons, the entity that speaks to the Traveler on the Golden Apple Archipelago sounds young. (This is true across all four voiced languages.)
