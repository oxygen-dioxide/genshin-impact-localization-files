===I: The Golden Apple Vacation Returns!===
{{Main|The Golden Apple Vacation Returns!}}

Returning to [[Mondstadt]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] learn from [[Katheryne]] that [[Fischl]] was looking for them and told them to meet her at the statue outside the [[Favonius Cathedral]] if she ran into them. They head to the statue where they find both Fischl, [[Oz]] and [[Mona]], where Fischl reveals that she was given land in a faraway place to use for the summer. Fischl is excited to head to the outrealmish land, while Mona is more or less suspecting that [[Alice]] and [[Mona's Master|her master]] were likely behind it. The Traveler and Paimon recognize the place as the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]].

Recalling that [[Venti]] had taken them there before, they head to [[Angel's Share]] where they find him alongside [[Xinyan]] and [[Kaedehara Kazuha|Kazuha]], who both had came from Liyue and ended up at Mondstadt, passing by the [[Dawn Winery]] in the process. Venti shares a tale about the recent visit made there before offering drinks which Kazuha eagerly takes as the Traveler talks with him in private. Venti learns of the visit and that it had been planned all along, giving them a prototype communication device that Alice had given him, as she and [[Klee]] had just passed by a few days ago.

When they head downstairs, they find Kazuha drunk, with Venti realizing that he likely mixed up juice and cocktails, much to Paimon's annoyance. Nonetheless, both Xinyan and Kazuha were eager to join along so the Traveler invites them to catch up at the front gate the next day. There, they meet with Fischl and Mona, who take a liking to the two newcomers. They then head outside the city boundaries and find a Dodoco-themed device outside, which takes them to the Archipelago.

There, Fischl and Mona get into an argument over who could swim better and begin a race while Xinyan goes to prepare the camp. Kazuha decides to scout the islands and asks the Traveler to come along. During their investigation, they find a strange device and that people had been around recently. Those "people" were actually the [[Fatui]], upon which they run into an odd [[Fatui Skirmisher - Cryogunner Legionnaire|Legionnaire]] and defeat him. The skirmisher continues to cry when a Fatuus named [[Persikov]] arrives. Persikov explains that the Fatui came to the island to test a device he wanted but failed, so they were about to leave. Persikov is surprised to learn the islands belonged to someone but agrees to have the Fatui stop exploring the area. Kazuha asks the Traveler to keep the Fatui's presence unknown to the others so they could enjoy their vacation.

Returning to the camp, they find the three more relaxed. The Traveler and Paimon call Venti and inform him of the Fatui presence on the archipelago, who states that he isn't surprised if the Fatui could reach anywhere on Teyvat. He tells them that he has no idea what the Cryo Archon is up to and advises them not to worry about the Fatui.

===II: As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared===
{{Main|As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared (Part 1)|As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared (Part 2)|As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared (Part 3)}}
The next day, Paimon when into panic when she found that [[Waverider|their boat]] talking with a squirrel, quite literally. Then the campers notes that a lot of strangers things is happening in these particular area, even Mona's attempt to read a divination seems to fail. Suddenly, a thunderstorm appeared and as lightning strikes, something that wasn't originally on the map had appeared in mirages, making the islands become totally different regions.

The campers decided to investigate with the first destination to an island near [[Pudding Isle/2.8|Pudding Isle]], Kazuha noticed his family's bonsai pot just sitting there, with no plants planted on its soil. Upon touching it, they suddenly entered into an Inazuman-style maze where Kazuha himself is nowhere to be found.

The campers found Kazuha at the end of the maze, and revealed that the domain was made from his own memory, and it locked the samurai out to not put up to his own past. The campers were attempt to leave the domain by touching the bonsai again, and after leaving they realized the bonsai is a key to relieve Kazuha's past and also recreate the mountains of Pudding Isle to take shape to match the style of three regions the Traveler had visited thus far. Since it may reveal secrets to the mirage, the samurai were attempt to make a rock garden like his grandfather's generation trend.

Every time the bonsai is created, it revealed the day Kazuha become a wanderer, the day [[Kaedehara Clan]] went decline, and the day he went aboard [[Alcor|the Alcor]] as the fugitive during the [[Vision Hunt Decree]]. Kazuha learns that the bonsai represents his desire to uphold the tradition for his own clan. The samurai also theorized that the mirage might reveal something related to either Xinyan, Fischl, or Mona. 

The Traveler attempt to contact Venti again, but they couldn't reach him and decided to contact him tomorrow. Later, Mona finds the Traveler and said that since the mirage, Fischl were worried about her own mirage and keeping an eye for her while also trying to find out the strange occurrences on the archipelago.

==Trivia==
<section begin="possibly kusanali voice" />
* During [[Immernachtreich Apokalypse (Part 3)]] and [[Like Rhyme and Song, the Summer Reverie]], the unknown entity that the Traveler speaks to through the [[Dodocommunication Device]] and telepathically is strongly implied to be the [[Dendro]] [[Archon]] [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]:
**The entity hints that the player will meet them at some point in the near future.
**After the entity finishes speaking to the Traveler for the last time, a {{Dendro}} elemental symbol briefly appears in front of the Traveler.
**The entity seems to have the same voice as the one teased at the end of the [https://youtu.be/OBzQlqcH4J8?t=1925 Version 2.8 Special Program] during the new region preview. (This is true across Chinese, English, and Korean, the only voiced languages with a Special Program.)
**Sumeru, the nation of {{Dendro}}, is the next playable region, in accordance with both the new region preview (which has historically been shortly before the official release) and the ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]''. (As of Version 2.8, [[Chapter II]] has concluded, with the Traveler ending their search in Inazuma and running into Dainsleif in The Chasm.)
**Despite the fact that the Dodocommunication Device was made by [[Alice]] and was only meant to allow communication between the [[Traveler]] and [[Venti]], this entity somehow not only cuts off that link but also commandeers it.
**[[Persikov's Manuscript]] revealed that the [[Fatui]] machine, which caused the mirages and hallucinations experienced by the party and the Fatui, was modeled after the power of a God (Archon).
**The entity admits they helped "design a little something" for the Traveler and friends, referencing the machine and/or the mirages.
**Additional connections that aren't as direct:
***A "mirage" of knowledge is mentioned in ''Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail'' for [[Sumeru]]. However, the original Chinese text uses a word for "bait" instead of "mirage."
***The Version 2.8 Special Program showed a [[Statue of The Seven]] that appears to depict a child. While it is unknown whether Statues of The Seven depict current or previous Archons, the entity that speaks to the Traveler on the Golden Apple Archipelago sounds young. (This is true across all four voiced languages.)
