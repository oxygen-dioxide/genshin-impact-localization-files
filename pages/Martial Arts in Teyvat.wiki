=== Origin ===
The {{Lang|Origin|ja=源流}}<ref>{{Lang|Normal Attack: [[Origin]]|ja=通常攻撃・源流}}</ref> is a martial art school founded by [[Ei]] the Raiden Shogun, the current Electro Archon of Inazuma.

According to Ei, Inazuman martial arts for naginata and swords, as well as Inazuman swordsmithing techniques, are basically originated from her.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About Us: Legacy}}</ref><ref group="Note">Although the English version of the voice line "About Us: Legacy" uses the term "polearm," the Chinese and Japanese versions only mention naginata, a type of Japanese polearms. It therefore does not conflict with the lore that cross spears were invented by [[Kitain Bunsou]], not Ei.</ref> The school's signature sword art [[Musou no Hitotachi]] is performed when the Raiden Shogun administers divine punishments. [[Kazuha's Friend|Kazuha's friend]] died as it was his last wish to witness this sword art in action.

'''Known Practitioners:'''

*[[Ei]] the [[Raiden Shogun]] (Founder)
*[[The Shogun|Puppet of Beelzebul]] 

'''Reading and etymology''': considering its English translation, the kanji of the school 源流 is probably read as ''Genryuu'', meaning the "Source" [of a river; figuratively of a civilization or a culture]. Alternatively it can be read as ''Minamoto-ryuu'' (Minamoto school), where {{Lang|{{w|Minamoto clan|Minamoto}}|ja=源}} is one of the two most prominent samurai clans (another being the {{w|Taira clan|Taira}}) and Tokugawa shoguns also claimed to belong to the clan; under this reading it is possibly a reference to the semi-legendary school Kyou-Hachi-ryuu founded by {{w|Kiichi Hōgen|Kiichi Hougen}} (the legendary teacher of the folk hero {{w|Minamoto no Yoshitsune}}), from which almost all martial art schools in West Japan are said to be originated.

===Shinryuu ===
{{main|Shinryuu}}
A unique school of martial arts that involves honing one's combat skills against opponents recreated from imagination. Developed by [[Shousen]], it was inspired by the "shadow boxing" training method practiced by the boxers of Natlan. Due to the dangerous nature of Shinryuu, many of its students abandoned the art out of fear, or were expelled by Shousen because of their recklessness.<ref name="shinryuu">{{Ref/Quest|Phantom Flow: Phantasmal Blade}}</ref> The [[#Kujirai Art|Kujirai Art]] (namely "Temari Jutsu") is implied to have been created using Shinryuu.<ref name="kid kujirai" />

'''Known Practitioners:'''
*[[Shousen]] (Founder)
*[[Eiin]]

*[[Kid Kujirai]] (implied)

===Touzannou's Arts===
While the [[Watatsumi Island]] is not so known for the tradition of swordsmanship, Touzannou, the mortal lieutenant of [[Orobashi]] who was feared as [[Akuou]] ("Evil King") by his foes, developed two prominent sword arts: {{Lang|Getsumouun|ja=月曚雲|ja_rm=Getsumou'un|ja_tl=Moon Dark Cloud}} and {{Lang|Yuushio|ja=夕潮|ja_tl=Evening Tide}}.<ref name="Debates on the Viceroy of the East">{{Ref/Book|Debates on the "Viceroy of the East"}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Akuoumaru}}</ref> These arts are still popular among the warriors of the Watatsumi Island.<ref name="Debates on the Viceroy of the East" /> It is unclear if the style has a particular name as a whole.

===Yoohoo Arts===
The Yoohoo Ninja Arts are a style of ninjutsu techniques practiced by [[Sayu]], and perhaps other members of the [[Shuumatsuban]]. According to Sayu, the style is supposedly named for its focus on "making fun of the enemy".<ref name="yoohoo">{{Ref/VO|Sayu|More About Sayu: III}}</ref>
