|desc_suspicious = It's been braised for too long, resulting in meat that's too soft. The fatty cuts are greasy enough to give you palpitations, and you can barely scarf them down even when wrapped in the Qingxin leaves.
|desc_basic      = The cut of meat is a happy medium between lean and fatty, and has been braised to smoking perfection. The ingredients glisten, and are soft but not greasy. Word has it that the Tianshu of a certain generation of the Liyue Qixing invented this dish after much painstaking development.
|desc_delicious  = Its intense aroma can be detected from miles away. The ingredients look exquisite in every way, capturing the essence of its original design. It would not look out of place on a gourmet spread at Yuehai Pavilion.

==Trivia==
*In a previous version of the game, the "suspicious" text for this dish said that the person eating it "can barely scarf them down when wrapped in the small lamp grass". However, [[Small Lamp Grass]] is not used in this dish; it was later corrected to [[Qingxin]] leaves, which are actually used.
*It is one of [[Yun Jin]]'s favorite foods.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yun Jin|Favorite Food}}</ref>
*To celebrate [[Qiqi]]'s birthday in 2022, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] published a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/20341 real-life recipe] for Tianshu Meat.

===Etymology===
*According to the description, this dish was invented by one of the Tianshu of the [[Liyue Qixing]]; as the current Tianshu, [[Uncle Tian]] is a possible candidate.
*Tianshu Meat is a reference to {{lang|{{w|Dongpo pork}}|zh=东坡肉|zh_rm=Dōngpō ròu|zh_lit=Dongpo Meat}}, a type of {{w|red braised pork belly}} named after the Song dynasty poet, statesman, and gastronome {{w|Su Shi}}, also known as {{lang|Dongpo|zh=东坡|zh_rm=Dōngpō}}. Dongpo pork notably cuts the pork belly into squares like in Tianshu Meat.
**An idiom originating from Su Shi's poem is used as the name of [[Kaedehara Kazuha]]'s special food, [[All-Weather Beauty]].
