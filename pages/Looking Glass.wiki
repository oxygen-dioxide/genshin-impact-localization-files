'''Looking Glasses''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Fontaine]]. They appear as mirrors that, when interacted with, will teleport the player to another location. The player can only interact with a Looking Glass when it is glowing purple.

==Gameplay Notes==
* The player must complete the {{Quest|Book of Esoteric Revelations}} in order to interact with the Looking Glasses.
* Five of them can be encountered while completing the {{Quest|Search in the Algae Sea (Quest)}} and its four subquests.
* A sixth one can be found in [[Tower of Ipsissimus: Bottom]] after the tower has sunken, on the same floor as is initially entered from the outside. After entering, turn around, go straight through the doorway and look right.

==Looking Glass Rooms==
The six Looking Glasses listed above will teleport the player to a different completely enclosed room within [[??? (Fontaine)|???]]. Each of these rooms contains three more Looking Glasses: the one the player entered through, one displaying the Tower of Ipsissimus, and one showing an image of sunflowers. Initially, only the tower mirrors are interactable, and will teleport the player to a second, inactive Looking Glass, near the original Looking Glass they used to enter that room.

Each room also contains a floating, glowing fish, though it may not be immediately visible. The fish must be sent through the sunflower mirror, and the way to do so will vary with each room:

* Orthant of Memory: Defeat {{Enemy|Thundercraven Rifthound Whelp|x=3}}.
* Orthant of Wishes 1: Defeat a {{Enemy|Rockfond Rifthound}}, then open the [[Remarkable Chest]].
* Orthant of Wishes 2: Defeat {{Enemy|Thundercraven Rifthound Whelp|x=3}}.
* Orthant of Persona: Defeat a {{Enemy|Thundercraven Rifthound}}, then open the Exquisite [[Chest]].
* Orthant of Souls: Use {{Pyro}} to light the two torches next to the {{color|buzzword|unlit mirror with sunflowers}}:
*: [[File:Looking Glass OS1 Location Context 2.png|400px]]
* Tower of Ipsissimus: Bottom: Swim around the barriers and open the Exquisite Chest.

When all six fish have been sent through the sunflower mirrors, they will become interactable and the {{Quest|Through the Looking Glass}} will automatically start. These mirrors teleport the player to another location within ??? to proceed with the quest.

==Enkanomiya==
During {{Quest|Collection of Dragons and Snakes}}, the player can encounter a picture frame inside the library in {{Location|The Narrows}}. Upon reaching the final step of that quest, it begins glowing blue and functions similarly to a Looking Glass, teleporting the player to an alternate version of the library. Given the Enkanomiyan architecture in ???, the picture frame and the Looking Glasses may be related in some fashion, though this remains unexplained.
