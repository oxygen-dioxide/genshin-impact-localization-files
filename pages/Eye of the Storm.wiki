{{Description|The corporeal form of extremely high-quality Anemo energies. The formation of an Eye of the Storm indicates that the elemental ley lines of a region are blocked, which has led to siltation. Its reckless, heedless wielding of storms that all but sweeps people off their feet may be due to its nature as a symbol of the world stricken by malaise.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
For most of the attacks below, the core will be exposed for a few seconds after the Eye of the Storm uses their attack. Use this opportunity to deal damage to it.

In some instances, when its health falls below 20%, it will fall to the ground and cease all offensive retaliation against the player. This leaves it completely vulnerable to all attacks (bar Anemo elemental damage) until its defeat, and makes its effective health only 80% of what appears on the health bar.

Strangely, it can occasionally take extremely low (~0.02% of health) damage from an Anemo character.

*'''Vacuum Crash:''' Creates a [[Vacuum Field]] that draws the player to the middle of the circle, and then crashes down hard at the center, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Anemo DMG}}. After using this ability, it will be stunned temporarily.
*'''Tornado:''' While in mid-air, the Eye of the Storm charges for a while, and then quickly forms a tornado that charges in a straight line, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} to players that come in contact.
*'''Domain of the Wild Wind:''' Flies high, and starts to channel [[Anemo]] power to the earth, creating a wind wall around it that prevents the player from moving out. After a while, it will deal '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Anemo DoT}} to grounded players and generate wind currents at random locations. While channeling this ability, it will expose its core, a single hit while exposed will make it fall to the ground.

==Strategy==
*[[Bows|Bow]] and [[Catalysts|Catalyst]] users can allow the player to attack the Eye of the Storm at range and when it is airborne.
*While the Eye of the Storm is performing '''Domain of the Wild Wind''', attack the Eye of the Storm with a ranged attack in order to immediately interrupt the attack and stun the Eye of the Storm. If no ranged attack is available, the player can use the upwards wind currents generated at random locations to avoid damage, as the attack only deals damage to grounded targets.
*The Eye of the Storm can be [[Frozen]].

==Trivia==
*Eyes of the Storm are the only [[Elite Enemies]] that don't drop any ascension materials upon death. Likewise, for reasons unknown, they are not listed in the [[Adventurer Handbook]].
