==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|A hot air balloon carrying cargo seems to have been targeted by monsters. Stop the monsters from seizing the cargo and escort the hot air balloon safely to its destination.}}
{{dialogue start}}
;(During the escort in Mondstadt)
:'''Paimon''': Uh oh, the transport balloon is stuck in the air because of the wind.
:'''Paimon''': I bet it's those Hilichurl Shamans! We'll have to defeat them to get the wind to stop.

:{{DIcon}} To the left
:{{DIcon}} To the right
{{Dialogue end}}

==Enemies==
Each wave of enemies is accompanied by a barrier of some sort: usually destructible [[Hilichurl Structures|Hilichurl roadblocks]] or towers, but sometimes other obstacles that must be bypassed (e.g., by defeating the enemy creating it or activating an [[Anemo Amber]] to fly over it).
The barrier(s) must be removed/bypassed in order for the transport balloon to continue, but other enemies do not necessarily need to be defeated&mdash;they will despawn after the balloon passes the barrier.
