==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hoturoa:''' It's a pity, I'm not really good at anything except for swimming...
:{{DIcon}} Having one specialty is pretty good already.
::'''Hoturoa:''' Haha... You're right, but most [[People of the Springs]] do know how to swim, yes?
::'''Hoturoa:''' If you're looking for people with much natural talent for battle, we'd disappoint you. Pretty lackluster on the ambition front, too...
::'''Hoturoa:''' But we're serious as can be when facing battle head-on &mdash; in terms of attitude, anyway!
::'''Hoturoa:''' Anyway, I should get stronger after learning some weapon-handling techniques... or after doing some grappling with the [[Collective of Plenty]]!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Don't push yourself too hard.
:::'''Hoturoa:''' O&mdash;Oh, don't worry, I'm not! The whole point of a goal you set yourself is to put in the effort to achieve it, right?
:::'''Hoturoa:''' That way, even if it doesn't work out just like you wanted, you won't have any regrets.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Teachings of Contention|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Good luck.
::'''Hoturoa:''' ...Fair enough. I'll make sure I keep up the swimming!
