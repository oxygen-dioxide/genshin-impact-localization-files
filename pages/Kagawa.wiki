''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Kagawa wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Kagawa is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'', whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kagawa:''' Mm, yes... Getting closer to nature is also part of training.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything I should take note of nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Kagawa knows; Version 1)
:::'''Kagawa:''' Well... Come to think of it, I did see some purple crystals while training around these parts.
:::'''Kagawa:''' That said, I don't do any metalworking, so they're of little use to me. I think they were around here... There we go, I've marked it out on your map.
:::'''Kagawa:''' Remember to enjoy the scenery while you're on the way there!
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Kagawa knows; Version 2)
:::'''Kagawa:''' Well... Come to think of it, I did see some rare Magical Crystal Ore while training around these parts. They say that the quality of these is a fair shade superior to those of ordinary ore.
:::'''Kagawa:''' That said, I don't do any metalworking, so they're of little use to me. I think they were around here... There we go, I've marked it out on your map.
:::'''Kagawa:''' Remember to enjoy the scenery while you're on the way there!
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Kagawa knows)
:::'''Kagawa:''' If you asked me, I'd say that the scenery here in Watatsumi Island is the most notable thing.
:::'''Kagawa:''' Immersing yourself in nature as you train is a truly satisfying experience.
:{{DIcon}} Training?
::'''Kagawa:''' That's right. I believe that people need to go out and train more while they're young. Only by absorbing the essence of both the sun and moon can one really train one's body and soul.
::'''Kagawa:''' You see, the blooming of flowers mark the changing of the seasons, and the flow of this waterfall marks the flow of time.
::'''Kagawa:''' We all live in nature, and we should appreciate its beauty rather than bury our heads in work all the time...
::'''Kagawa:''' Wait, uh, I mean, you can only work at your best after you've trained yourself, am I right?
::{{DIcon}} That's a pretty good point.
:::'''Kagawa:''' Exactly! I met a [[Kaedehara Kazuha|young samurai]] with a streak of red in his hair, and he said so too.
:::'''Kagawa:''' ...I'm not sure if this was the precise meaning of his words, but it's a sure bet that he's a nature-lover, just like me.
:::'''Kagawa:''' Not to mention that his abilities were way above mine, too! He could apparently tell what the weather would be just from the movement of the wind and grass. He must have reached the apex of training, I'm sure of it!
:::'''Kagawa:''' Ah, nature is so lovely. I, too, must train harder.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You're just lazing around, aren't you?
:::'''Kagawa:''' Oh, come on, read the room.
:::'''Kagawa:''' Life is short but the flowers are lovely. There's no need to rush.
:::'''Kagawa:''' Take these. I hope it all goes well with you.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Elegance|20|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kagawa:''' Farewell. Remember to smell the flowers and take in the sights as you travel.
