:'''Gulabgir:''' Even though my new life here is not easy, by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], I'm still filled with hope.
:{{DIcon}} New life?
::'''Gulabgir:''' I used to be a snake handler in the rain forest. I recently moved to the harbor and make my living as a busker.
::'''Gulabgir:''' I thought life at the port would be more convenient than wandering in the wild. Only after coming here did I find out that it's not easy for the locals here, too.
::'''Gulabgir:''' In the rain forest, we were awakened by [[Dusk Bird]]s early in the morning and searched for food. At the port, people get up to work alongside the sound of trumpets of the fleet.
::'''Gulabgir:''' I'll never return to the simple life in the rain forest, but I shall always remember the time spent singing stories under the moon with my companions.
::'''Gulabgir:''' Colorful mushrooms and fruits roasting on the fire. A rainbow-like tapestry before our eyes... Ah, good times.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} The Forest Watchers might have a problem with that.
:::'''Gulabgir:''' Th&mdash;They can't know it, for sure!
:::'''Gulabgir:''' I bumped into the [[Tighnari|long-tailed Forest Watcher]] once and got my noggin beaten. It really hurt!
:::'''Gulabgir:''' But if you think about it, it's actually quite some memory, to be dragged by rescue dogs all the way to [[Gandharva Ville]]. You should try it sometime.
:::'''Gulabgir:''' Just kidding! It's important to listen to the Forest Watchers for your own safety.
:::'''Gulabgir:''' After all, the rainforest is full of both safe ingredients that can make a delicious meal and incredible stuff one should avoid.
::;(Obtain [[Selva Salad]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} About Greator Lord Rukkhadevata...
::'''Gulabgir:''' Isn't the story of the Greater Lord the best proof of hope?
::'''Gulabgir:''' She sacrificed herself to defend the land of Sumeru from calamity.
::'''Gulabgir:''' She may have passed away, but other lives continue to thrive on the land and in the sea.
::'''Gulabgir:''' Ah... The songs that had been sung among [[Vanara]] are popping into my mind again.
::'''Gulabgir:''' I should replay them next time. I'm sure to make more money with that. After all, who in Sumeru doesn't love the Greater Lord?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Gulabgir:''' See you. Things will get better still!

''Available after completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]].''

:'''Gulabgir:''' My new life here is not easy, but thanks be to the Dendro Archon &mdash; I'm still filled with hope.
:{{DIcon}} New life?
:;(See [[#Dialogue Set #1|Dialogue Set #1]])
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the Dendro Archon...
::'''Gulabgir:''' Ah, and isn't the story of the Greater Lord the best evidence for hope?
::'''Gulabgir:''' She sacrificed her power to defend the land of Sumeru from calamity.
::'''Gulabgir:''' She did this so that other life, whether on land or sea, might continue to thrive.
::'''Gulabgir:''' Ah... The songs that had been sung among Vanara are popping into my mind again.
::'''Gulabgir:''' I should perform them again next time &mdash; that'll fetch me a good sum of Mora for sure. After all, who in Sumeru doesn't love the Dendro Archon?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
