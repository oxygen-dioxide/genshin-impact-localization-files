|description   = When Yumemizuki Mizuki is in the Dreamdrifter state, she will continuously apply the "Twenty-Three Nights' Awaiting" effect to nearby opponents for 3s every 3.5s. When an opponent is affected by Anemo DMG-triggered Swirl reactions while the aforementioned effect is active, the effect will be canceled and this Swirl instance has its DMG against this opponent increased by 900% of Mizuki's Elemental Mastery.
