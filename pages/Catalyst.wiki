'''Catalysts''' are one of the five [[weapon]] types that [[characters]] can use in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

All Normal and Charged Attacks of Catalyst users deal elemental damage.

==Normal Attacks==
A Catalyst user's Normal Attack chain typically consists of 3-4 single-target or AoE elemental attacks from range. These attacks take varying forms depending on the character, and their maximum ranges vary greatly between characters.

Ranged Catalyst Normal Attacks can be:
* Projectile-based. Projectile-based Normal Attacks fire projectiles of various forms that home towards their target. Since these attacks are projectiles, characters with this type of attack may still hit targets out of their targeting range if positioned correctly. An example of this is [[Ningguang's Normal Attack]].
* Non-projectile-based. Non-projectile-based Normal Attacks will hit the target near instantaneously at range, and it is impossible for them to hit targets out of range. An example of this is [[Lisa's Normal Attack]].
** [[Yae Miko's Normal Attack]] and [[Nahida's Normal Attack]] are unique as they have fixed hitboxes originating from the character's location instead of spawning attacks at the target's location when locked on.

[[Shikanoin Heizou]] has unique Normal Attacks where he performs 5 melee attacks in the form of fisticuffs with AoE and speed similar to [[Sword]] users.

==Charged Attacks==
Catalyst users' Charged Attacks typically consume 50 [[stamina]] to unleash a more powerful AoE attack after a short delay. These attacks spawn at the target's location when locked on.

Exceptions include:
* [[Ningguang]]'s Charged Attack which fires one large homing projectile that deals damage in a small AoE on hit.
* [[Shikanoin Heizou]]'s Charged Attack where he performs a melee attack in the form of an upward kick at the cost of 25 stamina.

==Plunging Attacks==
All Catalyst users have similar animations when plunging, which involves them turning into a glowing elemental ball and reappearing upon striking the ground.

Catalyst Plunging Attacks are considered ranged attacks, and cannot deal any damage to [[Geo]] objects such as [[Mineral]]s.
