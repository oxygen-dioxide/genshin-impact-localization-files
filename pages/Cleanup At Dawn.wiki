{{Quest Description|After the storm, head housemaid [[Adelinde]] is preparing to render the [[Dawn Winery]] spick and span on the inside and out, but things aren't going so smoothly...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Adelinde)
:'''Adelinde:''' Clean the place again, and I want it spotless this time! This is about making a good first impression!
:'''Moco:''' Sorry, Ms. Adelinde!
:'''Hillie:''' We'll be more careful this time, Ms. Adelinde!
:{{DIcon}} What's up?
:'''Adelinde:''' Ah, hello, Traveler. Welcome to the Dawn Winery. The storm may have passed, but here at the Winery we're still cleaning up the mess it made.
:'''Adelinde:''' I'm trying to organize the cleanup operation, but these girls, they&mdash;
:'''Moco:''' Sorry, Ms. Adelinde!
:'''Hillie:''' We'll be more careful this time, Ms. Adelinde!
:'''Adelinde:''' Yes, you've said that already, thank you very much! Now, why don't you put your efforts into cleaning instead of standing here apologizing to me? Shoo!
:'''Adelinde:''' These kids... Ugh, they're so sloppy. I don't know how we'll ever get through it all at their rate of progress. And even after that, there's still the indoors that needs cleaning.
:{{DIcon}} I can help.
::'''Adelinde:''' Do you know how to sweep? Actually, scrap that, we're so short-staffed that I should be taking all the help I can get.
:{{DIcon}} I'm an excellent sweeper.
::'''Adelinde:''' Really? That's wonderful. Well, since you're willing, I'll gladly take you up on the offer.
:'''Adelinde:''' Follow me indoors, there's plenty of cleaning that needs doing in there, too.

----
;(Talk to Hillie and Moco)
:'''Hillie:''' Ugh, the Winery is just too big. How are we supposed to clean the whole place?
:'''Moco:''' After cleaning the outside, there's still the inside to do. Are we ever gonna get this place clean...

----

;(Enter the Dawn Winery)
:'''Paimon:''' The floorboards are really dirty. What happened here...
:'''Adelinde:''' That storm brought tons of dust in, and even though we closed the doors and windows, they still flew in through the tiny gaps.
:'''Adelinde:''' While the storm was still raging, I had to store the plates and bowls upside down every night, because by the following morning they'd be caked in dust.
:'''Adelinde:''' I've finally made some progress with the cleaning now that the storm is over, but the floor is a whole other story... it's so dusty, I don't know if it'll ever be fully clean again. Ugh, what a nuisance...
:'''Adelinde:''' I'm extremely grateful for your help. If you could, please clean up as soon as you can.

----

;(Talk to Adelinde before cleaning all the stains)
:'''Adelinde:''' It's so wonderful that you are able to help out. I know I have Moco and Hillie, but... *sigh* they're more a hindrance, to be honest...

----

;(After cleaning the stains)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like we're all done and dusted with doing the dusting! Let's report back to Adelinde.

----

;(Talk to Adelinde after cleaning the stains)
:'''Adelinde:''' Finished?
:{{DIcon}} All done.
:'''Adelinde:''' Wonderful, this was a huge help. I can't imagine how long this would have taken me by myself.
:'''Adelinde:''' And if I'd gotten the girls to do it... Who knows how many items they'd end up destroying in the process...
:'''Adelinde:''' Thank you, please take these. I do apologize for troubling you, a visitor, with the work of a Winery maid.
:'''Adelinde:''' Next time you visit, the Winery will be spotless.
