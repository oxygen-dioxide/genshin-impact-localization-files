{{Description|You meet a treasure hunter named [[Ulman]] by the Inazuman seaside. He was once the partner of a [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]], but for reasons unknown, the Seelie suddenly stopped responding to him. However, this Seelie seems to be quite interested in you. Perhaps you can become its new treasure-hunting partner...}}
'''Lost Riches''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 2.0]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
*Event Duration: 2021/08/06 10:00 – 2021/08/16 03:59
*Event Shop Duration: 2021/08/06 10:00 – 2021/08/20 03:59

===Requirements===
*[[Adventure Rank]] 30 or above
*Complete the "[[Ritou Escape Plan]]" quest in the [[Archon Quest]]

===Summary===
* Check the treasure map within Ulman's Treasure Book. Follow the map to reach the area where the treasure is buried. Ulman will mark out two new areas in this book each day, for a total of 14 treasure areas.
* While looking for treasure, you will also earn [[Iron Coin]]s. Iron Coins can be traded with Ulman for Mini Seelie, [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]], and [[Mora]].
* While searching for treasure, you might encounter a challenge. Once you complete the challenge, all participating players will obtain the rewards. Throughout the entire event, you may collect a total of three challenge rewards in other players' worlds.
* When unearthing treasure, you may sometimes also gain a special Treasure Map Fragment. If you are able to piece these fragments together, you may follow the hints given by that map to discover a Secret Trove. When you draw near to one such Secret Trove, you can summon the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] and use the Seelie's reaction to help you locate the trove.
* Upon completing Area 14, the Event Shop will open for the redemption of "[[Mini Seelie: Viola]]", "[[Mini Seelie: Dayflower]]", "[[Mini Seelie: Rosé]]", and "[[Mini Seelie: Curcuma]]." You can only redeem one of the four. Upon redeeming one of them, you will no longer be able to redeem for the other three. Each Mini Seelie can only be obtained once.
===Notes===
* Enemies spawned by this event will grant their normal [[Character EXP]] and [[Common Ascension Materials]] (if applicable).
** Enemies spawned by the event challenges will not grant anything.
* Secret Troves can be accessed early as long as the area requirement is met.
** Treasure maps can still be obtained for secret trove that has been completed.
* Players cannot skip tiles in the Secret Troves' puzzles by jumping. Players can only toggle adjacent tiles.
