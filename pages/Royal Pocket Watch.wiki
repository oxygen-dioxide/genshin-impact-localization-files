{{Description|A pocket watch that once belonged to the old aristocrats of Mondstadt. Passed down from generation to generation, it has witnessed many years of history.}}
'''Royal Pocket Watch''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Noblesse Oblige]].

==Description==
An exquisite pocket watch made of sapphire.<br />It remains functional even after all these years.

The pocket watch of a noble who once ruled over Mondstadt. The time it tells is still accurate.<br />Punctuality is a virtue, and this pocket watch helped the nobles stay on a virtuous path.<br />It was more for self-discipline than a tool to influence the common folk.<br />At daybreak, a worthy noble must be more vigilant than his people.<br />At night, he should be more thoughtful and restless than they.

Over the years, the once-strict schedule was overturned by their indolent descendants.<br />Their timepieces grew more extravagant, but lost their virtuous function.
