==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Banka:''' *sigh* A healthy body should come before everything...
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Banka:''' Me? I'm fine, completely fine.
::'''Banka:''' It's [[Kumar]], my younger brother... His body is frail, and he needs to rest and recuperate in a place with a lot of trees.
::'''Banka:''' Before he fell sick, I used to sell in the city the quarries I hunted. But I have to look after him now, so I rarely leave the village unless it's to get medicine in the city.
::'''Banka:''' Sometimes, getting ill or not is beyond our control... He's still so young, so I just hope he gets well soon.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Things will get better.
:::'''Banka:''' Hehe, I know it's just a polite gesture, but it's still comforting.
:::'''Banka:''' Hope [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] will hear our wishes as my little brother always prays.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Kalpalata Lotus|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Banka:''' Mm, see you.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Banka:''' Do you think that city life would be best, or if staying in Vimara Village will be better?
:{{DIcon}} Are you planning to move into the city?
::'''Banka:''' Me? Well, I'm fine right where I am.
::'''Banka:''' It's [[Kumar]], my younger brother, that I'm talking about here. Now, it's pretty much a fact that the Dendro Archon has cured everyone suffering from [[Eleazar]], Kumar being one of them.
::'''Banka:''' And now that he's well, I suppose it's about time that he made some plans for the future.
::'''Banka:''' He's got a long list of things that he wants to try, but I've got a feeling that going to the city to study might open a better path for him than staying here or going out on adventures.
::'''Banka:''' If he can become a researcher or something of the order, he won't have to want for anything again.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Ask him what he thinks.
:::'''Banka:''' Yeah, you're right. It's his life, after all, so should it be his decision.
:::'''Banka:''' here's plenty of time, so there's no need for us to rush.
:::'''Banka:''' Look, here's something he brought back recently. Most of these flowers grow in high places. He would never have been able to pick them before &mdash; that would have been unthinkable.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Kalpalata Lotus|x=4}})

:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Banka:''' Mm, see you.
