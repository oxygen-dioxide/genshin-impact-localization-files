==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Navayi:''' Allow me to guess. The next one should be... a trial?
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
::'''Navayi:''' Ah, hello! I'm a traveling scholar from [[Sumeru]], and not a local. Pleased to meet you.
::'''Navayi:''' I don't know how much you know about Fontaine, but I'm still in the process of understanding it myself.
::'''Navayi:''' You see, Sumeru is a nation ruled by scholars, while Fontaine is a nation led by judges &mdash; and their social structures are immensely different.
::'''Navayi:''' Not a bad research direction, eh?
::{{DIcon}} I think it's worth further study.
::'''Navayi:''' That's my view as well, and I think so even now.
::'''Navayi:''' Still, I must say the events that have occurred in this [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]] have really given me pause. Who would've thought that trials and theater could occupy the same space?
::'''Navayi:''' This would have been inconceivable in Sumeru.
::'''Navayi:''' But if you think about this another way, the causes of this situation would also serve as a good research topic...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'll leave you to your thoughts...
::'''Navayi:''' It's okay. Thoughts are supposed to be exchanged through communications, no?
::'''Navayi:''' Thank you for talking to me.
::'''Navayi:''' Let me see... I only have some food brought from the [[Court of Fontaine]]. If you don't mind, please accept it as a greeting gift.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Fish and Chips|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} I'm not entirely sure, sorry.
::'''Navayi:''' Don't worry. I'm not trying to grill you &mdash; I'm just making a guess.
