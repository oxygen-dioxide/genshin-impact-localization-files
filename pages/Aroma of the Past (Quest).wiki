{{Quest Description|The Knights have provided Razor with the ingredients he needs, and preparations seem to almost be complete. Head over to the Knights of Favonius Headquarters to check in on them.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(On passing time)
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lisa said that the Knights of Favonius would help us get ingredients for Razor's wine, right? They should probably be ready by now.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go check.

;(Enter the Knights of Favonius headquarters)
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon wonders how Razor's "class" has been going...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Sucrose! Wait!
:{{Introductory Note|character=Noelle}}
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Honorary Knight (Traveler), Paimon, please stop her!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you scared Paimon!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's gotten the two of you so worked up?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Sucrose and I agreed to present the wine ingredient to you together. But when she heard that Razor will be showing up, she insisted that she won't spend a moment longer here than she has to.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I&mdash;I'm not good at dealing with strangers... Anyway, as long as the ingredient gets into the right hands, that's all that matters...
:{{Introductory Note|character=Sucrose}}
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' That won't do! We worked on this together and we should present it together. I can't take credit for what you did.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' It's not about... the credit...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so does this mean the Knights of Favonius' ingredient is a product of Bio-Alchemy?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Yes, it's a Quadruple-Sweetness [[Sunsettia]].
::{{Item|Sunsettia|notext=1|70}}
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quadruple sweetness? But aren't regular ones sweet enough as it is?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also... why a Sunsettia?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Okay, um, let me give you the full story.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I love the scent of wine, and after reading up on the art of wine-making, I have grasped some of the key principles.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 08.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' In short, whatever ingredients you use, it's essential to include something sweet.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 09.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' In an attempt to select the most suitable ingredient, I gathered samples of all the sweet plants and fruits I could find in the Mondstadt area. Then, I tried them all in turn and took detailed notes.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 10.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I also factored in the differences between the same ingredient grown in different locations. For instance, [[Sweet Flower]]s from [[Springvale]] are a little sweeter than those at [[Cape Oath]].
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that sounds like a lot of work...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 11.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' It was no problem at all. Just my duty as a Maid of Favonius!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 12.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' The chance to source the "defender's will" on behalf of the Knights of Favonius is a huge honor for me!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Noelle, your eyes are sparkling...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Paimon thinks it could be because of Lisa's brainwashing...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, shush.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 13.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Um, anyway, I was worried that my evaluation would be too subjective if only I were involved. Thankfully, I ran into Sucrose the other day on her way out of the lab...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh no!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 14.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' What is it, Sucrose?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I just remembered why I left the lab that day... I was supposed to go and fetch some lab equipment we imported recently...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 15.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh... That look on your faces seems to say, you forgot all about it and have been in the lab this whole time...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 16.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Yeah, exactly... I'm so sorry...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' *sigh* Don't worry about it, it's my fault really. I'll go and see [[Marjorie]] about the equipment shortly. Carry on, Noelle.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 17.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Oh, okay!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 18.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Anyway, Sucrose is a true professional when it comes to this kind of research! I showed her my list, and she made some extremely valuable suggestions...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Please, you don't need to go out of your way to compliment me...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Noelle filled me in on the background of the whole situation.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I was moved to see how seriously she took this task, even though she'd never even met Razor before. However, none of the potential ingredients she had identified were perfect candidates, in my opinion.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' What we needed was a fruit high in sugar and easily fermentable. After a final look at Noelle's list, I picked the Sunsettia sample from near [[Cider Lake]] as a basis, with a view to improving it.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Using Bio-Alchemical techniques, we were able to amplify the sweetness, then conduct a few tests to compare the results against the benchmarks...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 19.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Watching Sucrose work on an experiment when she's in the zone blew me away! Such focus and determination...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah, I already said don't compliment me...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Anyway... The result of our research is the "Epsilon-Series Tetrasweet Sunsettia, Variation 63," and it's finally ready. The sweetness has been verified through rigorous testing, and the size and color are both optimal, too.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Noelle shortened the name to "Quadruple-Sweetness Sunsettia."
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Unfortunately, it can't be produced on a very large scale under the current conditions... but as long as we have enough for Razor.
:{{DIcon}} This is more than sufficient.
:{{DIcon}} Can I have a little bite, just to taste?
::{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 11b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! What's wrong with you?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 15.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' (Traveler)... there's something else I'd like to share with you.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 16.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Growing up... I was lucky. I was never the best at dealing with other people, but my parents never placed any expectations on me.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 17.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' They never said to me, "you need to be more sociable," or anything like that. They just said I should "do what I enjoy."
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 18.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' So, I'm well aware that... I'm one of the lucky ones.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 sucrose 19.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I haven't lived Razor's life, and I can't pretend to imagine what it must have been like. So, I don't know how much it will mean coming from me, but... I truly hope that he can find happiness and spend his life doing what he loves.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 20.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Aw, Sucrose...
:'''The door of the library:''' *click*
:(Sucrose leaves the scene hastily)
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 razor 01.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Sorry. I am late again.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Teacher, forgot about the time. Kept talking, and talking.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's alright, we were just chatting. ...Whoa, déjà vu. Paimon said the exact same thing two days ago...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Wait a sec, where did Sucrose go?)
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 21.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' (Wow, she disappeared the moment he opened the door...)
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 22.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Hello! I'm Noelle, Maid of the Knights of Favonius.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 razor 03.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Hi.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 23.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Here's our ingredient for you. Oh, but I can't take full credit for it! I had help from an alchemist, but right now, she... umm...
:{{DIcon}} She's a little busy with work.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 24.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Right, yes... it's a shame she couldn't be here to present it to you in person.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 razor 04.ogg}} '''Razor:''' *sniff* Smells like... potion, nectar, and [[Anemo Crystalfly]]... right?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, nothing gets past your nose, does it?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 razor 05.ogg}} '''Razor:''' This Sunsettia is sweeter than ones I have smelled before. Klee said alchemy is amazing. It can make things better.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 25.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' That's right! I hope that this sweet fruit will help you brew the sweetest wine.
:{{DIcon}} The alchemist girl also had a message to pass on...
:{{DIcon}} "Spend your life doing what you love."
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 razor 06.ogg}} '''Razor:''' ...Thank you all.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 razor 07.ogg}} '''Razor:''' When she has time, I want to thank her, also.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 26.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Leave that to me! I'll figure out a way to persuade her to... ah, to not work so hard all the time, so that I can introduce you to each other!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 razor 08.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Okay, I will wait.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, now that we have all the ingredients, we can finally start making the wine. For that, we'll need a barrel &mdash; which, if Paimon remembers correctly, is waiting for us at the [[Angel's Share]] stand!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bye, Noelle! We're gonna head off now.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 2 noelle 27.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Good luck with everything. See you next time!

;(Optional, talk to Noelle again)
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq003 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Overall, I think this task was a success...
:{{A|vo dialog jnjeq003 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Oh no! Sucrose's lab equipment! I should go help her carry it!
:;(Noelle leaves)

;(Approach the Angel's Share stand)
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 01a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 01b.ogg}}--> '''Klee:''' Honorary Knight, Razor, over here! Look who it is!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, it's Diona! Paimon was sure we'd run into you at The Cat's Tail stand some time, but so far, we haven't seen you all festival!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Ooh... Traitors...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Umm, wh&mdash;what?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Arrrggghhh!!! I'm SO. MAD.
:{{Introductory Note|character=Diona|guaranteed=yes}}
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Klee told me the whole story. So this bright idea was the brain child of you two, hmm? How could you? Razor is Daddy's friend... and he was a good influence... right up until YOU got him interested in wine!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Razor, you'd better promise me that you won't turn into one of those old boozehounds that drinks themselves silly, slumps over the bar, and bursts into tears!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 razor 01.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I, uh... I don't understand.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like there's been some crossed wires here...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Klee, what exactly did you say to Diona?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 02b.ogg}}--> '''Klee:''' Ummmm... I told her that Razor's looking for his mommy with the Honorary Knight's help, and you both seemed really sad, and said you needed some wine, so maybe Diona could help...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' But before I finished, Diona said, "Klee, say no more, I'm getting involved in this if it's the last thing I do." And... then we came here...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... okay... Paimon doesn't even know where to start. Diona, it sounds like Klee left out a few important details in this story. Let us set the record straight...

:'''You explain the situation to Diona...'''

:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' So you're saying... Razor wants to make the same wine that his mother and father once made, so he can learn more about them? ...Hmm, you'd better not be making this up to try and pull the wool over my eyes...
:{{DIcon}} No way.
:{{DIcon}} Absolutely not.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Sorry, Diona, it was all Klee's fault for not explaining it properly.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' So... are you still mad? Or can you help Razor make the wine?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I caught a bunch of fish for us to eat. Um... and you can pet Dodoco too if you want.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' ...I&mdash;I wasn't THAT angry.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' You were just trying to help. I understand.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I just don't want Razor being led astray, that's all. That's why I may have raised my voice a little bit just now... Hmm, well, since none of you plan on drinking it, then I suppose I can help you just this once, despite my reservations.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But I need you to know that I'm a mixer, not a brewer, so I'm used to working with the finished product. If you really want me to start with a bunch of raw ingredients, that's fine, but I can't make any promises about how it'll turn out...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yay! Diona is the best!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 razor 03.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Hehe.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, Diona, you got this!
:{{DIcon}} You can do it, Diona!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 10.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph, bunch of flatterers. Now watch this.

:'''Diona puts her signature mixological magic to work...'''

:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All done! That was quick!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now we just need to find a place to store it.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "We wait, wait for a windier day." ...Hmm, does that mean we need to put it somewhere exposed to the wind?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 razor 04.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Maybe... [[Windrise]]? Very windy.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! If you say the word "windy," that's the first place on every Mondstadter's mind.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Cool, I wanna come, too!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 11.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I have to keep an eye on [[Draff|my foolish father]], so I won't be joining you.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 diona 12.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Klee, come and play again some other time.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 3 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I will! I promise!

;(Approach Venti at the [[Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero]])
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah, what a curious coincidence meeting you here!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tone-Deaf Bard? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Well, I awoke to the most magnificent aroma in the air. After following the sweet scent of fresh fruit to its source, this is where I ended up.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yeah, the fruit are super fresh and super-duper sweet! I can smell it as well!
:{{DIcon}} There's another reason, isn't there?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Yes. Oh ah, I remembered something important. Something that you have to do before sealing the barrel and burying it in the ground.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' What? We missed something!?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Razor, do you still remember the scent of that half-bottle of [[Thousand-Wind Wine]]? I believe there was a hint of bitterness in there?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 01.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Yes, there was.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hahaha, and with very good reason, too. The source? ...This.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Dandelion Seed]]s?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' You're familiar with Dandelion Wine, right? Well, the people of Mondstadt believe that the wind can bring back the soul, and also preserve memories.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Dandelion Seeds are like living gemstones, formed from the first wisps of wind in the year. People add them to the mix at the last second as a way of capturing the wind in the very moment that the barrel is sealed.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The memory of that moment is then stored in the wine, for all time.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' So, Thousand-Wind Wine is the original [[Dandelion Wine]].
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' That's so cool! So now our story will be made into wine, too!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' As for why it always has a different scent... Well, that's because people have the freedom to include whatever ingredients they want, hehe~
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' What is it, Razor? Whatcha thinkin' about?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 03.ogg}} '''Razor:''' In mother and father's wine, I can smell Dandelion Seeds, but I don't know what else.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 04.ogg}} '''Razor:''' In my wine, there is a lot of... friendship.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 05.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I still don't understand my mother and father, but... I still have you, and everyone else.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 06.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Everyone has done so much for me.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 07.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Varka, [[Lisa|Teacher]], Klee, Bennett, [[Draff|Uncle Brown Cat]], [[Rosaria|cold lady]], [[Kaeya|grown-up with fake smile]]...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 08.ogg}} '''Razor:''' [[Noelle|Grey tough girl]], [[Sucrose|person that smells like Anemo Crystalfly]], [[Diona|Uncle Browncat's daughter]]...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 09.ogg}} '''Razor:''' [[Venti|Green bard]], Paimon, and (Traveler).
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 10.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I remember everyone.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 11.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Making wine... is hard work.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 12.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Making this wine needed everyone, working together.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 13.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Hard work with friends... not so hard after all.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 14.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I'm... I'm so happy.
:{{DIcon}} We are all glad to help.
:{{DIcon}} It makes us happy to see you happy.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 15.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Thank you.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 16.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Friends... are also lupical.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 17.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Whether I'm human, or I'm wolf... it doesn't matter. From now on, all of us are together.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 razor 18.ogg}} '''Razor:''' When I grow up, we will come back here. And we will open this wine... together.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' What a magnificent monologue. Even as a bard, I don't feel like there's anything else to add.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 12.ogg}} '''Venti:''' All that remains now is to bury the barrel and wait, wait for the fruit to ferment.

:'''The group buries the barrel in the ground...'''

:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're finally done. Paimon feels like a celebration is in order!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If Paimon remembers correctly, tomorrow should be Windcoming Day, right?
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Wow! The Anemo God is coming home!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 4 venti 13.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hahaha, that reminds me &mdash; I haven't memorized the song for the toasting ceremony yet. I'd better get back. Friends, I shall see you all tomorrow.

:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Tradition holds that the finest wine of the Weinlesefest only goes on sale after the Anemo Archon has tasted it at the toasting ceremony. Everyone's waiting in line for the big moment.

:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Yes, I was still feeling a little concerned about him. But I just spoke with him, and he tells me that the wine-making went very smoothly. Ah, such a relief... A glass of the festival's finest will go down smoothly now, too.

::"Pray tell, what treasure does this barrel hold?<br />'Tis wheat's greatest triumph, the true liquid gold.<br />As it flows from the keg, what sound drifts by?<br />Wind chimes in the boundless, immemorial sky."

:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 razor 03.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Don't feel sad, Klee.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' But why didn't he come? If the Anemo God didn't come home... is it because he doesn't like the wine we brought for him?
:{{DIcon}} I don't think so...
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course not! You know, Klee, the wind isn't the only form that the Anemo Archon can turn into. He can turn into anything! So today, he must've come back looking like something else!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Huh? Really? Maybe he turned into... a Jumpy Dumpty!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure! Jumpy Dumpty it is! Hope you're listening, Anemo Archon!
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Heehee... Razor, did the Anemo Archon bring you a blessing?

:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 razor 07.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I think that is a blessing.
:{{A|vo jnjeq003 6 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Don't forget to save me a glass of your wine once it's finished fermenting!

After completing ''Aroma of the Past'', Diluc, Lisa, Razor, Rosaria, Sucrose, and Venti can be found and interacted with in various parts of Mondstadt.

===Diluc===
Diluc can be found in the vineyards at [[Dawn Winery]].

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Diluc)
:{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' So, what do you think of the Weinlesefest? Have you enjoyed yourself?
:{{DIcon}} Do you want to chat?
::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Well, what would you like to know?
::{{DIcon}} About Razor...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 1.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' *sigh* I can sympathize with the anguish of being away from family.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 2.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Certainly, a tragic situation. But tragedy can also drive personal growth, and perhaps learning how to face it head-on is part of growing up... part of becoming an adult.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04a 3.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Having the support of some good friends will certainly make that journey easier.
::{{DIcon}} About the voices...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 1.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' ...When I unsealed the wine, it seemed that the words of my late father were sealed inside.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 2.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I wonder what he would think if he were to see me now.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 3.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Somehow, I doubt he'd share the same view as he did back then.
:::{{DIcon}} Of course he would.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 4.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Heh...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04b 5.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' If you say so.
::{{DIcon}} About the Weinlesefest...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 1.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' To the people of Mondstadt, wine-making is a way of working through emotions, and remembering our history.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 2.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' We're only able to make such high-quality wines these days thanks to the peace we enjoy. War is a thing of the distant past.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 3.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Even though you might not see me reveling with the crowds, I am grateful for this as much as anyone.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 4.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Say, have you tried our latest product, "Fruits of the Festival"?
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 04c 5.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' If you have any thoughts on how it could be improved, I'm all ears.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace.
::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 diluc 02b 1.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Sure. We'll talk when you're free.

:{{DIcon}} Do you want to chat?
::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I'd love to, cutie. Hmm, too bad I can't offer you some tea.
::{{DIcon}} About Varka...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I was quite surprised to learn that the Grand Master had written a private message just for me.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 2.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' And I was equally surprised to find out that Razor's been on his mind this whole time.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 3.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Especially given how demanding he is of Jean... He left her to figure out the whole Weinlesefest on her own, and didn't give her a single word of acknowledgment.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07a 4.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I'll have to have to a stern word with him on Jean's behalf when he returns.
::{{DIcon}} About Razor...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's funny &mdash; I always thought the Grand Master was the one who gave him the name "Razor"...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 2.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' But it turns out his birth parents chose it all along.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 3.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' ...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 4.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Anyway, Razor told me he heard the voices of his parents during the festival.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 5.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' "Like stepping on a rock in the sun. Warm, but also heavy."
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07b 6.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I'm sure he must think of them as both kind and dauntless people...
::{{DIcon}} About the Weinlesefest...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Originally, I only planned on having a glass or two. I thought I deserved a treat after being such a good teacher recently.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 2.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' But that was before I came to appreciate how truly exceptional the festival-exclusive vintage was...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 3.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Before I knew it, I was already rather tipsy, hehe...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 07c 4.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I'm a bad example. Don't be like me, cutie.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace.
::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 lisa 05b 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Alright, but remember, it's important to rest when you're feeling tired. It makes my heart ache to see you so busy all the time.

:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 3.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Now, I am grown up.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06a 4.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I want to hear him talk about human father and mother.
::{{DIcon}} About your parents...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 1.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Their voices. I heard them.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 2.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Human father and mother... were adventurers...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 3.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Teacher said, maybe they didn't survive...
:::{{DIcon}} Aw, Razor...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 razor 06b 4.ogg}} '''Razor:''' [[Razor/Lore#Razor's_Crude_Wooden_Crate|I have a wooden box. Inside are treasures from my friends.]]

===Rosaria===
Rosaria can be found south of Mondstadt just outside the wall under a tree.

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Rosaria)
:{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 01.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' (Traveler), hello again...
:{{DIcon}} Do you want to chat?
::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 03.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Sure. Did you have something you wanted to ask me about?
::{{DIcon}} About Varka...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 1.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Oh. Yes, I read his letter. Barbara showed it to me.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 2.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' She'd been so worried about her father, Seamus. She almost burst into tears when she read that "the expedition is safe and all of its members are accounted for."
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 3.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Hmm? ...My thoughts?
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 4.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Hehe... You're curious what he means to me as a father figure, is that right? Well, I guess I'm not like other daughters. I can't bring myself to worry about him.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04a 5.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' He wouldn't be leading that many people if he didn't have the necessary strength and courage for it. He's not the kind of person you need to worry about.
::{{DIcon}} About Razor...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 1.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' So, he's finally come to terms with everything?
:::{{DIcon}} At the very least, he's no longer lost and confused.
:::{{DIcon}} He has a direction now.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 2.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Hmm, sounds like he still has some way to go before he can say he's fully independent. But everyone goes through their own life in their own way.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04b 3.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Well done. It sounds like your efforts were all worth it in the end.
::{{DIcon}} About the Weinlesefest...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 1.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' I thought that if I made it to the Weinlesefest, I'd have the chance to spend a whole day in the tavern. Turns out, there's actually more work during a festival than usual.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 2.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' I managed to escape to here, but I still can't completely let my guard down. Who knows when Victoria or Dahlia might show up and drag me off to the sung poetry event.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 rosaria 04c 3.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' *sigh* The sooner this festival is over, the better.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace.

:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Blessings? Oh, that.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 2.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Between you and me... I breathed a sigh of relief when nobody said their wishes out loud during the toast. That would've really put me in a tough spot. Hahaha... The Anemo Archon, Barbatos, doesn't have unlimited power, you know.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04a 3.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I had to take a really deep breath to get the winds of the far-flung past blowing. I nearly went blue in the face.
::{{DIcon}} About Razor...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' He's grown up so much recently... It's such a joy to see.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 2.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Huh... Suddenly I sound just like an old grandpa.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 3.ogg}} '''Venti:''' He was lucky to have friends like you ready to support him through all this.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 4.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I see a kind, gentle soul, with a healthy dose of romance and freedom, too... In other words, a true Mondstadter, who grew up drinking the water of Cider Lake.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04b 5.ogg}} '''Venti:''' You, on the other hand... Don't worry, you're the gentlest soul I've ever met.
::{{DIcon}} About drinking...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh, I've been very busy on that front. I'd long since drunk my fill by Windcoming Day.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 2.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But, uh, I wasn't counting on everyone bringing out their finest vintage to welcome me.
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 04c 3.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah, the fragrance alone was so intoxicating... I had no choice but to make room for a few more rounds...
:::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Full disclosure &mdash; I also secretly hid two bottles away for myself at the end.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace.
::{{A|vo jnjeq004 1 venti 02b 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Then go, my friend. The stories that unfolded here shall be remembered by the wind in the form of verse.
