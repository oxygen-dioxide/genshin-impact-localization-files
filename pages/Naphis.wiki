'''Naphis''' is the current Sage of the [[Amurta]] Darshan in [[Sumeru Akademiya]].<ref name="Trail">{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref> He was also [[Tighnari]]'s master while the latter was a student at the Akademiya.<ref name="Silent Seeker">{{Ref/Quest|Silent Seeker of Knowledge}}</ref>

==Profile==
When the sages proposed their project to work with [[Il Dottore]] to turn [[Scaramouche]] into a god, Naphis was one of the two sages who opposed the plan. In response, the other sages imprisoned Naphis so that he would not interfere. The sages pretended that Naphis was still active and working on the project, and would send letters to Tighnari under Naphis's name asking him to assist them.<ref name="godside">{{Ref/Quest|As by a God's Side}}</ref> Tighnari would reject the offer on account of his duties as a [[Forest Watcher]],<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/ox9_6NJP4J4 Character Teaser - "Tighnari: When All Is Said"]</ref> but offered to reconsider if they would explain the project's purpose and its duration. [[Haravatat]]'s sage, [[Khajeh]], traveled to [[Gandharva Ville]] to confront the Forest Watcher and in the ensuing conversation, insinuated that his rejection damaged Naphis' reputation. However, Tighnari retorted that if the project was as important as they claimed, the short-tempered Naphis would have personally come to berate him. After seeing that the two would not answer the questions he had posed in his reply to the letter, Tighnari rejected the offer a second time.<ref name="Silent Seeker" />

Once the corrupt sages were overthrown, Naphis was freed from imprisonment.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref>

===Personality===
Naphis' short temper is "legendary," and allegedly even Grand Sage [[Azar]], who is shown to be rather arrogant and condescending towards those he views as his lessers, avoids Naphis because of it.<ref name="Trail" />  Tighnari describes him as a man of integrity who sticks to his beliefs.<ref name="godside" />
