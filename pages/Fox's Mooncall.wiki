==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The kanji of a part of the Japanese word {{Lang|ja=吼噦|ja_rm=konkai|mini=1|ja_tl=to roar and hiccup}}, but it is used here as a kanji transcription of {{Lang|ja=こんこん|ja_rm=konkon|mini=1}}, the sound of the cry of a fox (similar to "meow" for cats in English). It may be also a reference to the ''{{w|Kyōgen|kyougen}}'' play ''Konkai'', which features the legendary kitsune {{w|Hakuzōsu|Hakuzousu}}.<br />{{See also|Meditations of a Yako#Trivia}}

|zh_note = 吼哕 (trad. 吼噦) literally means "to roar and vomit" in Chinese (possibly synonymous with 呕吼 ǒuhǒu, lit. "vomiting-roar" or fig. "howling of a beast") but probably it follows the Japanese sense here. The name in the traditional character version differs from that in the simplified one, possibly meaning "Fox-Crying Voice to Passing Years."
