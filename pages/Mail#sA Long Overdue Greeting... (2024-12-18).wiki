Now, as I sit to write, winter has arrived. People have begun wearing warmer clothes, switching to thicker blankets, and stoking their hearths. Most importantly, it's the season when everyone reaches for warm beverages.

Coffee and tea have become staples on many tables. Yet, if you ask for my preference, I'd recommend the hot water served at the [[Hotel Debord]].

Speaking of tea, despite sharing eighty percent of the batch I purchased earlier with [[Wriothesley]], the remainder has still lasted me a full year and counting. I thought he'd manage to deplete his share at least, but he told me, "Humans must exercise strategic restraint when drinking tea, or else they risk kidney stones."

He does have a point. If such risks were truly pressing, [[Sigewinne]] would likely impose strict measures. You should drink plenty of warm water as well &mdash; it's a cure for nearly everything.

Back to the topic, my chosen birthday is approaching once again. I've prepared a comforting broth and sincerely hope you'll grace the occasion with your presence.
