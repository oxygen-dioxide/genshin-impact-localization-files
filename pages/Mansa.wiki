==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mansa:''' Hello, and welcome to the Natlan branch of the Adventurers' Guild.
:{{DIcon}} Hi.
::'''Mansa:''' Nice to meet you, I'm the local Branch Master.
::'''Mansa:''' If you're new to Natlan, I recommend that you find yourself a local guide or someone who knows the lay of the land before setting out.
::{{DIcon}} Could I just look for you?
::'''Mansa:''' In theory, of course. But most of the time I have to stay here to help adventurers who come for advice.
::'''Mansa:''' There's no doubt that Ms. [[Katheryne]] is extremely reliable, but when it comes to all things Natlan, no one's more knowledgeable than us natives.
::'''Mansa:''' And in terms of their abilities, the [[Scions of the Canopy]] or the [[People of the Springs]] would make even better tour guides than I would.
::'''Mansa:''' As for me... Well, if you'd like, I can tell your fortune before you set off, I suppose?
::{{DIcon}} (missing dialogue after The Rainbow Destined to Burn)
:{{DIcon}} Thanks. Seeya!
::'''Mansa:''' I wish you the best of luck.
