|text      = As we all know, "wealth" is a relative concept. The vast domain of knowledge still holds countless areas that [[Paimon]] has yet to explore. But judging from her reading notes, she is already quite wealthy in comparison to many others.<br>
To celebrate her progress, I enrolled her in a course at the [[Akademiya]] a month ago, and I believe the notice has already reached her.<br>
If she successfully completes the course, she might even qualify to assist with research projects for the sages in the future,<br>
On that note, to confirm her enrollment status, please answer the following question: What is the full name of the instructor for [[Vahumana]]'s Society and Humanities course?
