==Description==
Rumored to be a legendary sword of Liyue.<br>
It was said its sheath was made with eaglewood, decorated with mica, and engraved with the imagery of war.<br>
This priceless sheath, however, was lost.<br>
To the blade, the sheath was its prison, keeping it from its true purpose.<br>
The blade is so sharp that its victims would only realize they had been struck an hour later.

It is said that [[Kunwu]] forged this prized sharp sword in just one day, though he worked all day and all night to do so.<br>
But when Kunwu's aged master saw his apprentice's work, he clenched his fists, sighed in anguish, and beat the ground with his staff.<br>
"O, pitiful is this thing merciless in all the world."<br>
The master let out a final, long sigh, and hobbled away.

Kunwu pondered his master's word for three days, and did not touch a single blade in that time.<br>
Then, he spent a whole year painstakingly carving an eaglewood sheath.

Kunwu thought that an elegant and opulent scabbard would surely suffice to subdue the wildness and violence of the blade.<br>
But then the prized sword was lost among the common folk. The sharp blade survived, and all that remained of the scabbard was its story.<br>
For the sharp blade seeks only to bathe in the blood of its victims, and no sheath can be made that will curb this desire.

*[[Keqing]] is also seen wielding the ascended version of this sword in her [[Genius Invokation TCG]] [[Keqing (Character Card)|Character Card]].
*{{Lang|Lion's Roar|zh=匣里龙吟|zh_tl=Dragon's Roar in the Box}}, along with another weapon forged by [[Kunwu]], namely {{Lang|[[Solar Pearl]]|zh=匣里日月|zh_tl=Sun and Moon in a Box}}, probably drew inspiration from a famous poem {{zh|古剑篇|tl=Tale of the Ancient Sword}},<ref>Gushiwen: [https://so.gushiwen.cn/shiwenv_30239239f544.aspx {{zh|古剑篇}}]</ref> which describes the casting of an ancient sword. In the poem, the "box"({{zh|匣}}) is a metaphor of a lotus emerging from a glazed box to describe the sword itself.
**The rough translation follows: "Didn't you see ''Kunwu''{{'}}s gems being refined into swords, in the red fire, with purple flames from the sword's edge? No one knows many years after skillful craftsmen's forging and smelting that this unparalleled sword named Longquan (''Dragon'''s Spring) was casted. Swordsman himself exclaimed proudly, that the sword shone like snow and frost. Like a white lotus spit out from a glazed ''jade box'', the golden ring on the hilt of the sword is dyed with the brilliance of ''the sun and the moon''. This sword was born just when there was no war in the world, so it must be fortunate to be worn by a gentleman for self-defense. The dazzling sword light swims like a green snake, and the pattern on the sheath is like floating green turtle scales. It's not only the rangers who cherish it very much when they see it, but also the heroes. Why keep saying that it was abandoned halfway and fell to the side of the desolate ancient prison? Although the sword is buried in the mud and can't play a role, the extraordinary flame formed by its powerful sword aura still illuminates the night sky every night."
