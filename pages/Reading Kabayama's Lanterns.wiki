;(Talk to Kabayama)
:'''Kabayama:''' How's things going? Sitting pretty?
:{{DIcon}} Whoa, that was sudden!
:'''Kabayama:''' Oh, uh, terribly sorry. That wasn't my intention to scare you.
:'''Kabayama:''' I'm Kabayama, and I often sit in the spot where you're sitting now. It's a nice, quiet place where you can just think about life.
:{{DIcon}} Would you like it back?
:'''Kabayama:''' Thanks, but it's alright. By the way, you're not from here, are you?
:{{DIcon}} That's right.
:'''Kabayama:''' Then you must be quite knowledgeable indeed. I've never seen the outside world, though I've had a lot of experience moving house.
:'''Kabayama:''' *sigh* Speaking of that...
:'''Kabayama:''' We moved so often when I was young that I never really had the chance to make good friends. I saw many a fine sight while wandering about, but there was no one to share them with...
:'''Kabayama:''' You know what? Why don't I show those places to you? If you pass by spots like this, take a seat and have a look about &mdash; then come back and tell me what you think.
:'''Kabayama:''' One such place is beneath a stone gate at the highest point in The Narrows. One of them is an open space surrounded by corals near the Evernight Temple, and the last one is beside the towering ruins at the Serpent's Heart.
:'''Kabayama:''' I've left markings on all these places, and hung a lamp there to light my way. You should find them, easy-peasy.

;(Talk to Kabayama again before finding all 3 locations)
:'''Kabayama:''' You're back.
:'''Kabayama:''' Haven't found all the places yet? Oh, that's a crying shame.
:'''Kabayama:''' Let me go over the locations again.
:'''Kabayama:''' One such place is beneath a stone gate at the highest point in The Narrows. One of them is an open space surrounded by corals near the Evernight Temple, and the last one is beside the towering ruins at the Serpent's Heart.
:'''Kabayama:''' I've left markings on all these places, and hung a lamp there to light my way. You should find them, easy-peasy.
----
;(Sit down on the rock at location 1)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like something's written on this lamp. Guess Kabayama left that behind, huh?

;(Read the lamp)
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' Unagi Fry Rice is the best. I ate it all! Not a single grain of rice was left behind, no sir!
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' Big Sister is very pretty when she laughs. She said that she'd never seen me eat that much, and that she'll make me more next time.
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' I wish we could stay together forever.
----
;(Sit down on the rock at location 2)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be the sign left by Kabayama. Let's have a look, shall we?

;(Read the lamp)
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' I know the way! But those Jibashiri just had to say that I got lost, and even scolded me for crying over a small matter...
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' I wasn't lost! And I didn't cry over some small thing!
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' ...I'll just leave a marking in the future...
----
;(Sit down on the rock at location 3)
:'''Paimon:''' This lamp's got words on it too. C'mon, let's see what it says!

;(Read the lamp)
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' Mom's mood has been improving. She's been all frowns ever since we left Dad behind.
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' Maybe it's because she found out that Dad is living just fine after the separation, but she isn't...
:'''Words on the Lamp:''' *sigh* It's just a shame that the library's got so many books that aren't for loaning. I wonder if Mom's read these stories... Ah, if only she'd read them to me.
----
;(After finding all 3 locations)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we've found all three of the spots that Kabayama mentioned. Let's go back and see him!

;(Talk to Kabayama after finding all 3 locations)
:'''Kabayama:''' You're back.
:'''Kabayama:''' You've found all the places? ...Well, perhaps they're not much to look at for someone as well-traveled as you.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I thought that they looked quite unique.
:{{DIcon}} They were pretty run-of-the-mill. I've seen more impressive sights.
:'''Kabayama:''' Ah, what a shame that I never managed to share them with anyone else. Still, I'm glad to just have your opinion.
:'''Kabayama:''' Perhaps there are many places more impressive than these. I mean, it is just dark down here, and there really isn't much variety in terms of food either. And we need to beware of the vishaps...
:'''Kabayama:''' But now that I've lived here for so long, I feel attached to this place, you know? And I still miss those few spots of mine.
:'''Kabayama:''' Do you ever feel the same way? Even a place like this can be called home once you've stayed long enough.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps.
:{{DIcon}} Not really.
:'''Kabayama:''' Is that so...
:'''Kabayama:''' Well, thanks for hearing me out, in any case. I don't have much to give you in return, really, but please take these.
