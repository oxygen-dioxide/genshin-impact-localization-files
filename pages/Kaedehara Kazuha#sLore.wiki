==Personality==
{{Quote|A wandering samurai from Inazuma who is currently with Liyue's Crux Fleet. A gentle and carefree soul whose heart hides a great many burdens from the past.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Kazuha is a polite and well-spoken person. Compared to other noble Inazuman clan members, he prefers going out and traveling rather than staying put indoors, something that the seizure of his clan home let him do due to a lack of wealth and duty. He once roamed [[Inazuma]] peacefully as a modest wanderer for a good portion of his life, teaching himself bladework and picking up other skills, never seeking luxury. He is instead easily pleased just by sleeping on a sun-warmed rock. The time he spends outdoors makes him attuned to nature and the wind, being able to "hear" and "smell" everything around him with absolute clarity. He can sense dangers, read people and track them down in an instant no matter how well they try to conceal it. Due to this sensitivity he prefers calm weather and never stays in one place for too long, having trouble sleeping for the former<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaedehara Kazuha|Kazuha's Troubles}}</ref><ref name="KazPot">{{Ref/Companion|Kaedehara Kazuha}}</ref> and having his skills stagnate for the latter.

Fitting in with his [[Anemo]] affiliation, Kazuha firmly believes in a concept of freedom - that everyone is entitled to their hopes and dreams and that no one has the right to take them, not even a god. For this reason, he opposes the [[Raiden Shogun]] and those who support her. Despite his values, he isn't prideful and can acknowledge the strong fighting prowess and honorable conduct of those he personally disagrees with. He sees his friend's duel as honorable and noble, but also that his subsequent execution by the Shogun was both fair and justified.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaedehara Kazuha|About the Raiden Shogun}}</ref> Along with his belief in the concept of freedom, Kazuha is determined in his goals, pursuing them with thoroughness and cunning, but he also takes his time and is easygoing. He is very reflective and thoughtful about all matters, frequently pondering about various topics in his travels. He holds his relationships in high regard, immediately coming out of hiding for [[Kazuha's Friend|his friend]] and forever grateful to [[Beidou]] and [[Gorou]] for taking him in when he needed shelter. Kazuha frequently warns others of coming storms and possible trouble, he happily does simple errands, offers advice, and is willing to help others.

He was grieved after the death of his friend and wouldn't speak to any of his crewmates after joining the [[The Crux|Crux]], but eventually warmed up to them and is fairly chatty according to Beidou. Kazuha has a very poetic side to him, he enjoys penning haikus in his spare time and is easily inspired, though he claims to not be especially talented at it. As a result of both traveling many places and sailing for long periods of time, Kazuha has grown particularly fond of readily available grilled fish and takes the time to prepare and finish his food slowly. While he is not picky about what he eats, he does not appreciate rushed meals or lazy cooking methods. His most prized possession is his sword that he keeps with him at all times, a source of pride for Kazuha as both an Inazuman and a samurai. He is also incredibly fond of red maple leaves, finding them beautiful and enjoys seeing them rain during autumn. When unable to view such sights, he frequently collects and carries them as a memento to ease any homesickness.<ref name="KazPot" />

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Kazuha is a young man with choppy, medium length hair, some of it tied in an off centered ponytail to his right. It is a platinum blonde color, apart from a single orange-red streak on his right. He has red eyes with a yellow hue at the bottom, and he usually has a gentle facial expression.

Kazuha's outfit, [[Falling Leaves]], is described to have maple leaf patterns that are the hallmark of his wandering samurai attire. It consists of a grey short sleeved kimono and a black ''haori'' coat. Half the coat is worn normally on his left arm, with a flowy orange sleeve decorated with orange and red maple leaves, while the other half is draped behind his waist and secured by an ''obi'' belt he wears over top. He wears a black and red scarf with gold accents, and a slanted belt that goes under his right arm and over his left shoulder, where his Anemo Vision is pinned behind. The [[Vision]] is tied to a red tassel decoration, and is near a samurai shoulder plating. He wears red ''hakama'' pants with maple leaf designs and black sandals with dark red tights and a black piece of leather on both legs that covers from under his kneecaps to near his feet.

He wears black glove plates that protect the backs of his hands and his left forearm. His right hand is instead bandaged, though in the past it was not. A possible result of this change was that after taking his friend's Vision, the last of its energy burned his hand as he fled,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Follow the Wind|note=Cutscene}}</ref> though it is unknown if Visions act like this. Another possible reason is that bandages commonly help protect against constant sword use, and around the time of the change, Kazuha would have needed to take better care of his hands. Kazuha is right-handed, and would have begun fighting more often after exposing himself. He would also have to help out when the crew set sail, where his hands might form calluses.

{{Quote|If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.<br />But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.|Kazuha's Musings}}

A wandering samurai from [[Inazuma]] with a modest and gentle personality.

Beneath a youthful and carefree demeanor lies a heart that hides a great many burdens from the past. Seemingly easygoing, Kazuha has his own code of conduct.

Kazuha leads a wandering life, setting out on his journey in the day, and sleeps with the sky as his blanket and earth as his bed in the night. Wealth has never been his pursuit, and regardless of summer or winter, what he seeks has always been true peace in his heart. Despite the wilderness being his home, he never worries about the impending rain or storm. It is as if rainstorms are afraid of him, because they do not dare to cross his path.

Out of curiosity, someone asked about this talent and Kazuha answered with absolute honesty &mdash; reading the sounds of nature is a unique ability of his. People do not usually pay attention to the weather, so it is no surprise that they are unable to discover the signs it reveals. However, given Kazuha's skill, he can sense the arrival of snow and rain immediately with just a gust of wind or abnormal humidity. That is when he knows it's time to seek shelter.

Kazuha, who has traversed around the lands, has avoided countless torrents of storms and flashes of lightning. This time, however, what awaits him will be an unprecedented thunderstorm. This time, he will no longer seek refuge. He, the rain, and the lightning will meet at the intersection of fate, as destiny marks it.

"&mdash;&mdash; I hear a storm strike far and distant, with only a whisper light and faint. From the sky there falls no rain, thus here I shall still remain."

But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.</p><p>As the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.</p><p>He had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.</p><p>To Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.</p><p>When the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.</p><p>These are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway &mdash; so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?</p><p>Thus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind.</p>

For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.</p><p>After leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.</p><p>All that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.</p><p>It was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.</p><p>The traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: "Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!"</p><p>But Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: "If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away."</p><p>But the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.</p><p>Upon knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.</p><p>Perhaps it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.</p><p>When he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha standing nearby, looking down at him and smiling.</p><p>Before the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.</p><p>Kazuha smiled and said: "The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care."</p>

Or so Kazuha thought.</p><p>But something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition &mdash; the [[The Shogun|Almighty Shogun]] promulgated the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] and swore to retrieve all Visions.</p><p>All who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.</p><p>It was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a "duel before the throne," and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.</p><p>The defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself.

*[[Birthday/Kaedehara Kazuha]]

==Trivia==
*Kazuha is the first playable Inazuman character. Like [[Tartaglia]], he was temporarily listed under [[Liyue Harbor]] on the official website, which is the region where the player first meets him, and was then moved to the newly added Inazuma section of the website on the [[Version 2.0]] release.
*Kazuha is the first playable character since the game's [[Version 1.0|global release]] who did not get a special dish or a [[Teyvat Food Notes]] entry on his release.
**However, after Version 2.0 was released, his special dish [[All-Weather Beauty]] was added, alongside the addition of its base dish [[Dry-Braised Salted Fish]].
*Despite hailing from Inazuma, because Kazuha was released before Inazuma was and his affiliation with the Crux, he uses Liyue talent books instead of Inazuman ones. He still uses Inazuman items for his ascension, although this is due to the fact that they [[Version/1.6|released earlier]] with the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]].
*Kazuha is familiar with the [[Watatsumi Army]] and the resistance led by [[Kamisato Ayaka]], [[Thoma]] and [[Yoimiya]], as outright stated and/or implied in [[Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow]] and [[The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia]] respectively.
**[[Kamisato Ayaka]] references Kazuha's friend, and implies that she knows Kazuha when the [[Traveler]] notes that they are aware of Kazuha's friend.
**After Kazuha and Beidou fight at the front line alongside the [[Watatsumi Army]], [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] welcomes him back to their group.
***Additionally, Kazuha has worked with Gorou before, as Kokomi remarks that they had gotten along well while he was with the resistance.
*Kazuha is seemingly able to perceive that the Traveler is from another world, as is suggested by his dialogue in the quest [[A Path Through the Storm]], making him one of the few characters who found out without being directly told.
*Kazuha, along with [[Xiao]], are the only characters who can perform an Elemental Skill midair.
*Kazuha's return animation after casting his Elemental Skill and after performing his fifth sword strike and Charged Attack differs from his normal return animation. Instead of throwing the sword away, Kazuha seals the sword in a scabbard as a mitsudomoe glows at his sheath hand.
*Kazuha is one of the two Event Exclusive 5 Star character to not receive a Story Quest on release.
*Most Inazuma trees that can be bought from [[Realm Depot]] are hinted to be named by Kazuha.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Flower's First Blushing Bloom}}</ref>
*Kazuha is one of only a few characters who have been seen wielding more than one element, though it was temporary for him. During [[The Omnipresent God]], Kazuha wielded both {{Anemo}} from his own Vision and {{Electro}} from the Masterless Vision that belonged to [[Kazuha's Friend|his friend]].
*Kaedehara Kazuha is known by these aliases or titles:
**Kaedehara Kid (by Juza)

===Etymology===
*Kaedehara ({{Lang|mini=1|ja=楓原}}) means "maple grove" (lit. "maple field") and Kazuha ({{Lang|mini=1|ja=万葉}}) means "a myriad of leaves."
**The character {{Lang|mini=1|ja=万}} literally means "ten thousand," but it is often used to more broadly mean "a number which is vast and difficult to fathom."
**Kaedehara can also more broadly mean "original maple". The word Hara 原, meaning "original" is the same as in Genshin (原神).
*Kazuha could be named after the "''Man'yōshū''" (万葉集) - the oldest collection of Japanese poetry. All of Kazuha's Elemental Burst voice-overs are snippets of poems from the ''Man'yōshū.''
*In Chinese, the first word of Kaedehara Kazuha's name 枫/楓 meaning "maple" is a homonym of the word 风/風 ''(fēng),'' which means "wind". Furthermore, 枫 contains the word 风 in it. The same wordplay is found in Japanese, although only in written form.
*His constellation, Acer Palmatum, is the {{w|Binomial nomenclature|scientific name}} of the {{w|Acer palmatum|Japanese maple}}, which his character design revolves around.
*In his [[#Vision|Vision]] Story, Kazuha contemplates a mantra: "If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty. But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure." This mantra is likely a reference to mantras from the {{w|Heart Sutra}}, a popular sacred text in many schools of Mahayana Buddhism, including Japanese Zen schools, which were the standard religion for samurai. In this context, realizing one's heart is ''{{w|Śūnyatā|empty}}'' is equivalent to achieving ''{{w|nirvana}}'' (perfect happiness and quietude), the ultimate goal of Buddhism.
**Chinese and Japanese equivalents for the in-game mantra roughly translate to "If one's heart is ''empty'', all things in heaven and earth are ''empty''; if one's heart is ''pure'', all things in heaven and earth are ''pure''." A subtle but important difference from the English translation is not only all things ''under'' heaven but also those ''in''/''of'' heaven are essentially empty. It is a typical Buddhist tenet against Eternity, which is the theme of Inazuman chapters.

===Haiku===
In his [[Kazuha/Media|Character Demo]], Kazuha recites the following {{w|haiku}}. In the English, Chinese, and Japanese versions, the poem follows the 5-7-5 syllabic structure.<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1364y197Kt 《原神》角色演示-「枫原万叶：风流蕴藉」]</ref>

* In the Chinese version, the "Solitary Cloud" or {{Lang|"Guyun"|zh=孤云}} could refer to the [[Guyun Stone Forest]], where Kazuha appears to be in during the start of the trailer. The Guyun Stone Forest is also where [[Beidou]]'s fleet [[The Crux]] can be found.
