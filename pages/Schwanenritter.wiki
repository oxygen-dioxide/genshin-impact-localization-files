The '''Schwanenritter''' were an order of knights from [[Khaenri'ah]] prior to the fall of the [[Eclipse Dynasty]] and the [[cataclysm]].

==Overview==
{{Quote|We Schwanenritters have fought to the last one.|Knight Marshal Anfortas|[[Cryptic Message in Sumeru]]}}
The Schwanenritter were responsible for operating the trio of Ruin Golems deployed from their homeland to the region of Sumeru.<ref name="ZL">Interactible: [[Zandik's Legacy#Akademiya Investigation Team's Interim Report|Akademiya Investigation Team's Interim Report]]</ref> At some point they were attacked by beasts of the Abyss,<ref name="MC">Interactable: [[Mysterious Chronicle]]</ref> though it is unclear if fighting the Abyss was the original reason for deployment and presence in the region.

The Ruin Golem in [[Valley of Dahri]] experienced an inherent mechanical design defect while in the desert, becoming unstable. Without the proper replacement parts or the ability to manufacture more, the Schwanenritter could only salvage parts and keep the weapons systems functional for their continued fight. The golem continued to degrade, until eventually its smart boot systems became inoperable and its mobility was greatly hindered. It was abandoned in the desert to await eventual retrieval.<ref name="ZL" /> Parts were salvaged to assist in the continued operation of the second Ruin Golem on [[Devantaka Mountain]].<ref name="ZL" />

At some point Knight Hildric died of multiple-organ failure caused by unknown circumstances, and Knight Ynghildr went missing in a fight against the "Onslaught of Dark Beasts", with only her signet ring and a second unknown personal item recovered. This left only Knight Hadura and Knight Marshal Anfortas remaining.<ref name="MC" />

For unknown reasons and in unknown circumstance, Hadura "betrayed" the other Schwanenritter, sabotaging and destroying "a machine" (potentially the second Ruin Golem). For this, she was executed by the Knight Marshal Anfortas, who lost an eye in the event, but still given a knight's funeral, as the last remaining member of the company besides Anfortas. With his entire force seemingly deceased, Anfortas continued to fight alone until his own presumable death, believing himself to be the last of the Order.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Cryptic Message in Sumeru}}</ref>

Unknown to Anfortas, as to the other members of Schwanenritter, Ynghildr did not perish in the fight against the beasts of the Abyss, but was instead corrupted after she went missing, becoming a [[Shadowy Husk]]. She returned to the fallen Golem, where she remained guarding the control module of the semi-operational ruin golem until modern times.

==Key Personnel==
Currently, Anfortas' declaration that they'd fought to the last suggests the Schwanenritter are small detachment of Khaenri'ahn knights. Their membership is as follows:

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Like most Khaenri'ahn names, "Schwanenritter" and the names of its members are of Germanic or Nordic origin:
** ''Schwanenritter'' is German for "Swan Knights."
*** The {{w|Knight of the Swan|Swan Knight}} is a medieval tale about a knight who rides in a swan-drawn boat and assists a damsel in distress, provided that she does not ask him his name. The most well-known depiction of the Swan Knight is through {{w|Lohengrin}}, from the Arthurian epic ''{{w|Parzifal}}'' written by the German poet {{w|Wolfram von Eschenbach}}.
** In Eschenbach's ''Parzifal'', "Anfortas" is the name of the {{w|Fisher King}}, an immortal king in Arthurian legend tasked with guarding the {{w|Holy Grail}}.
