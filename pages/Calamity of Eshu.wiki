==Description==
Just as a butterfly is nothing more than a shriveled green cocoon before its metamorphosis,<br><!--
-->The graceful Red Flamingo is naught but an ash-ball of feathers in its infancy,<br><!--
-->And so it was with the great priest who bewitched the people with confounding words,<br><!--
-->Who spent much time silent after his birth.<br><br><!--
-->The elder who oversaw the tribe's ritual fire claimed that half his soul had been lost in the night flames,<br><!--
-->And so, on his birthday, the silent child stepped into the barren lands of stone to seek his missing self.<br><!--
-->But such a journey was full of perils, for the soul must cross seven curtain layers to gain audience with the Lord of Silence,<br><!--
-->And few return, even with the aid of [[Saurian]] companions who can traverse the two realms.<br><!--
-->Only [[Mahamba]], most enigmatic of the [[Iktomisaur]]s, was willing to accompany this boy into lands unknown.<br><br><!--
-->In the long hall paved with obsidian, the boy was as a person whose eyes were opened for the first time.<br><!--
-->Memories of the ancient realm flowed like water through his pupils, and amidst the floating fluorescent lights,<br><!--
-->It was as if he himself had truly lived through those years... When the [[Xbalanque|first Pyro Archon]] made a vow to his forces before the volcano,<br><!--
-->He stood in the shadow of many heroes, though he had never been in these {{not a typo|past memories}}.<br><!--
-->When the city-sacking [[Och-Kan|Sacred Lord]], fallen into a haze, was beaten down by the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|crimson-eyed youth]] on the stairs before an empty throne,<br><!--
-->Down he gazed, and saw the face of the one who had fallen into dark mud above the city that was set ablaze.<br><br><!--
-->All that had happened in the past granted him comprehension of all words, their syllabic structures, and the meaning behind them,<br><!--
-->And that also allowed him to see further and for longer into the skeins of time,<br><!--
-->Until he realized that [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night|night's master]] had arranged for all this to be shown to him.<br><!--
-->At that time, the now-grown child saw [[Cataclysm|a shadow]] that would soon cover the whole of [[Natlan]], and the monsters from beyond.<br><!--
-->He saw the black shadow that enveloped the lonely isle, burrowing at all boundaries like a tarsal maggot, ravaging like a fire.<br><!--
-->Where the dark shadow lay, the deceased and the soon-to-die alike would weep aloud.<br><br><!--
-->When the dark fog was about to touch the tribes of Natlan, he could not help but cry: "Stop!"<br><!--
-->And with his first words, he suddenly awoke, finding himself lying by a blue bonfire.<br><!--
-->He saw Mahamba's eyes flash with a dim light, then the elder gave him a ceremonial staff.<br><br><!--
-->From that day on, Sanhaj, who knew all things about the past,<br><!--
-->Would use those ancient words to censure the fools who would make light of future dangers.<br><!--
-->From that day on, Sanhaj, who knew all stories, would weave a great net of lies,<br><!--
-->To turn the stacks of woven scroll into a veil, so as to hide a past that should not again be touched.
