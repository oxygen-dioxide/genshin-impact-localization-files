{{Description|A flower bud encased in solid ice. Even after being picked the flower continues to emit cold. A popular work of fiction tells of a fox becoming trapped in ice from a Mist Flower and being unable to extricate itself. For small creatures with limited strength, it is a very dangerous plant indeed.}}
