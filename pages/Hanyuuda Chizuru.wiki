==Profile==
Chizuru is a tsukumogami, a type of [[youkai]] based on objects that gained spirit or sentience. She was a pair of hagoita that were used by [[Kamai Kenji]] and [[Yanagibashi Takuto]] during their decades of friendship and attendance of [[Mikawa Flower Festival]]. Exposure to Kamai's great youkai power slowly gave the hagoita sentience, with it strongly manifesting during Kamai and Takuto's final game, where she witnessed how Takuto had grown too old and weak to be able to properly compete with Kamai, and Kamai sighed in sadness over their life span differences as human and youkai even after the two friend's parting.<ref name="TCoL">{{Ref/Quest|The Currents of Life}}</ref>

The intense emotion from the events caused Chizuru to blame herself for causing such pain and regret between the two friends as she was part of the instrument that brought them together and yet showed how different the two friends of different races are. As a result, she lived the rest of her life thinking that human and youkai friendships aren't meant to be, despite her loneliness and yearning to form connections with humans.

After hundreds of years, Chizuru's hagoita form starts to deteriorate and she is fading as a result. She has been hiding and slumbering quietly in the beach near [[Chinju Forest]] prior to the start of the events in ''[[Akitsu Kimodameshi]]''.

===Personality===
Chizuru at first comes off as a mysterious and frightening presence, framing herself like a vengeance spirit that will eat the soul of its victim should they not heed her warning. Her tones are sharp, as if indicating unfriendliness.

Nonetheless, her harsh exterior is a mere persona she puts up. Chizuru harbors deep trauma from witnessing first-hand the friendship and separation of [[Kamai Kenji]] and [[Yanagibashi Takuto]]. This caused her to not believe in the relationships between humans and youkai as she believes it will only bring sorrowful memories and lingering pain. As such, she will not shy from doing things to prevent such bond to happen despite hers or others' yearning for connection. However, when proven that she was still missing a piece of the story she clings to, she is open and is willing to accept the reality that humans and youkai can be friends.<ref name="TCoL" />

Chizuru seems to display high sense of justice as she went out of her way to punish a greedy human that messed with the venue of [[Akitsu Yuugei]] for their own benefit. She is also shown to be caring and considering towards other humans and youkai so they don't have to feel or witness the similar pain of separation as she once did.

===Appearance===
In her original form, Chizuru is a pair of hagoita, wooden paddles used in games of [[Akitsu Haneasobi]]. The handles are natural dark wood, with the main paddles painted in red adorned with illustrations of multiple white flowers and green vines and leaves. Thin red cords are tied around the base of the paddles in the shape of ribbon knot.

In her human form, Chizuru appears as a woman with fair skin and medium length brunette hair tied in intricate half up-do hairstyle. Her visible right eye has red iris with slit pupil, while her left eye is covered by an object that consists of three red and peach colored kanzashi flowers. The largest one, facing front, has an eyeball at the center, surrounded by decorative white stamens.

Chizuru wears a black kimono decorated with flowers and fire-like patterns in shades of crimson. On top of it is white obi sash with diamond patterns along with crimson colored obi-age and maroon obi-jime. She wears white tabi socks and black zori sandals with red straps. Around her neck is a red cord tied in ribbon knot facing the right side of her body, likely referencing the knot at the base of the paddle in her hagoita form.

==Story==
Chizuru first appears in the visage of a frightening ghost within [[Chinju Forest]] after the [[Test of Courage (Event Quest)|first day]] of [[Test of Courage]]. The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] catch sight of her and try to ask her the whereabouts of three little rascals, but she sternly warns them to leave her alone and causes the two of them to pass out.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Test of Courage (Event Quest)}}</ref>

After the [[Haunted Tales|second day]] of the Test of Courage, the Traveler and Paimon find her down at the beach in front of [[Akitsu Yuugei|Akitsu Yuugei's]] venue. Due to their newfound knowledge about [[Youko]], [[Kappa]], and [[Hitotsume Kozou]], the duo approach her fearlessly and invite her to a game of Akitsu Yuugei where the loser has to grant a wish for the winner. Chizuru showcases her skill by beating the game in record speed, thus making the Traveler concede. She then wishes that the Traveler and Paimon to never meet her again before disappearing. She goes on to scare members of the [[Arataki Gang]], who reports to [[Arataki Itto]] about it, causing unrest between the three little youkai and the event participants as no one seems to know who or what she is.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Haunted Tales}}</ref>

On the [[The Currents of Life|third day]], after some investigation, [[Shikanoin Heizou]], the Traveler, and Paimon confront her on the beach near Akitsu Yuugei's venue. At first she still tries to threaten them before Heizou sees through her bluff and knows that she is actually running out of time and keeping her farce up will not help her, revealing her true identity as a hagoita tsukumogami. Paimon asks Chizuru why she shuns and scares humans off despite previously seeming to enjoy playing Akitsu Yuugei with them. Chizuru then proceeds to tell them the truth about [[Kamai Kenji]] and [[Yanagibashi Takuto]]'s story that was told by Youko, citing the secret painful ending of their friendship as her reason for shunning the Traveler and Paimon as well as scaring other humans to not come nearby Akitsu Yuugei, wanting to protect them all from the pain of inevitable separation caused by their different life spans.

[[Yae Miko]] then approaches, and Chizuru recognizes her as someone who had joined the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] during her attendance of past [[Mikawa Flower Festival]]s. Miko said that she had recognized Chizuru's presence back then and felt similar presence while she was strolling around the beach recently, seeing Chizuru all by her lonesome and yearning, and thus joined with [[Kamisato Ayato]] to organize Test of Courage in order to help Chizuru face her problem. Miko also tell Chizuru that Kamai and Takuto's story didn't end as she knows it and reveals that Takuto eventually created the Souran Isshin Art, swordsmanship art based on his encounter with Kamai, and Kamai later befriended the inheritor of said swords art, [[Tominaga Masanari]]. They fought side by side and perished together [[Cataclysm|five hundred years ago]], and thus their friendship carries on in different form, much to Chizuru's astonishment and realization.

Itto interrupts the group, saying that he's going to to help the three little youkai organize the Mikawa Flower Festival, much to everyone's delight. After they finished setting up the festival, the Traveler and Paimon invites Chizuru to enjoy the festival with them. She agrees and takes a look around the festival with them, interacting with other attendants and helping Hitotsume Kozou get some water balloon.

After enjoying the festival, Chizuru speaks privately with the Traveler, telling them her real feelings about the festival and relationships between human and youkai. She wants to make a wish once again since the Traveler never granted her first wish. She wishes that the Traveler's journey ahead will be filled with joy like a festival, saying so while fireworks spark in the distance. After which she disappears, passing on peacefully.<ref name="TCoL" />
