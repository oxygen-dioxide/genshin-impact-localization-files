==Story==
Originally a scholar who intended to gain admittance to [[Sumeru Akademiya]] in the pursuit of knowledge, Kunwu changed tracks upon coming into possession of the [[Archaic Petra#Sundial of Enduring Jade|Sundial of Enduring Jade]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Sundial of Enduring Jade}}</ref> Upon discovering he could find no flaws in the sundial's design, he decided to become a craftsman himself in order to challenge its designer, [[Morax]], and create an item as equally flawless.

He eventually created the [[Kunwu Series]] of weapons.

==Trivia==
*During the third Closed Beta Test ([[Version 0.9.9]]), there was a polearm named Kunwu's Iris Rift, which detailed how Kunwu became an [[adeptus]] and forged this spear. The polearm was removed in Version 1.0, and its assets were repurposed into [[Vortex Vanquisher]], with a different name, description, and stats.
*It is likely that [[Kun Jun]] is his descendant, given that he comes from a family of famous artisans and shares a surname with Kunwu.
