If you can't recall, this snack can be a clue. Maybe you can remember when you see it.

To surprise you with a new flavor, I have spent a long time improving the formula. Please have a taste.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>sigh<nowiki>*</nowiki>... I wanted to hide this letter at the bottom of the snack box but feared that you might miss it. It would be a shame if you had.

I'll treat you to some fish next time. When the time comes, you have to keep an eye on it. Maybe there will be something hidden in the fish's belly.

Besides, I read an interesting article recently. It wrote that there was a righteous golden-haired [[traveler]] who did a lot of great deeds in many places in the world, and drew many compliments from many people. The content of this article is true, but whether it's exaggerated... I'll wait for you to come and judge for yourself.

I will be waiting for you on the rooftop tonight.
