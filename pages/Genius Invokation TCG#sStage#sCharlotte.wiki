:{{A|vo card charlotte invite easy 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I lost... *sigh* A few wrong moves and you lose the whole match. Genius Invokation is so complicated...

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card charlotte invite easy 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' So this is what it feels like to win a game of Genius Invokation... Hmm, not bad. I should write an article about it.
