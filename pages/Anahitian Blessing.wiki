'''Anahitian Blessing''' is a type of fertilizer that is said to be a blessing by the [[Dendro Archon]].

In [[Sumeru City]], it is distributed by the [[Akademiya]] to farmers for free, as long as they are on a certain list.<ref name="Salar">{{Ref/NPC|Salar}}</ref> Details about the distribution are written in the [[Akasha System]].<ref>{{Ref/BB|Mahamata Bulletin Board|Anahitian Blessing}}</ref>

[[Vahid]] sells it at the [[Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe]] in [[Ritou]], [[Inazuma]], though he doesn't have much luck besides a few repeated customers such as [[Konda Densuke]].

==Usage==
The Anahitian Blessing will guarantee a successful harvest if it is applied correctly.<ref name="Salar" /> The instructions typically involve adding crushed leaves and water to the fertilizer, as well as mixing it, though not necessarily in that order.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Inazuma Sales Specialist}}</ref> If applied incorrectly, an abundance of [[mushroom]]s will grow instead.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Post-Sale Service}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The Anahitian Blessing is said to have been used to bring back [[Padisarah]]s to existence.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Padisarah|note = Archive Description}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* In {{w|Zoroastrianism}}, {{w|Anahita}} is the deity most associated with water, healing, fertility and wisdom. That said, Zoroastrianism has a separate deity over wisdom called {{w|Ahura Mazda}}, whose name literally translates to "Lord of Wisdom." In different time periods, Ahura Mazda was either worshipped alone, or in a triad alongside Anahita and {{w|Mithra}}, the deity of contracts and light.
