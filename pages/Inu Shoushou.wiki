{{Lang|'''Inu Shoushou'''|ja=犬少将|ja_rm=Inu Shoushou}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|A Housekeeper's Daily Chores}}.

==Profile==
Inu Shoushou is a ninken of the [[Shuumatsuban]]. He was paired with his owner and they went on missions together until one day when he was given a top-secret mission and went alone without Shoushou, but didn't survive that mission. Shoushou remained by the shores near [[Konda Village]] ever since, waiting for his owner to return.

During Thoma's Hangout Event, Thoma spots Shoushou during his walks and tries to befriend it to no avail, even despite bringing the [[Traveler]] along. However, the Traveler recalls that if he is a member of the Shuumatsuban, he must have a partner. Thoma contacts [[Kazuaki]], who informs the two that Inu Shoushou's owner was dispatched on a dangerous mission at sea he did not return from, implying that he had died during his assignment, but the Shuumatsuban had assumed that Shoushou had been taken along with him. Kazuaki promises to have the Shuumatsuban cover Shoushou's expenses and Thoma brings back his partner's training kunai. With his owner's familiar scent on the kunai, he softened up to Thoma and the Traveler.

===Appearance===

Inu Shoushou is described by Thoma as a red Shiba inu in ninja attire. His appearance is similar to that of Taroumaru, but with a slightly darker coat and scarring on his left eye. His ninja attire consists on a dark blue headband with a paw print emblem, a black top, and a dark blue ''hanten'' with a paw print emblem on his left sleeve. His four paws are wrapped in white bandages.

==Trivia==
* Inu Shoushou's story resembles that of {{w|Hachikō|Hachikou}}, a dog born in the early 1920s who would always meet his owner, {{w|Hidesaburō Ueno|Hidesaburou Ueno}}, at {{w|Shibuya Station}} after he came back from work. On May 21, 1925, Ueno passed away while at work, from then until his own death, Hachikou would come back to Shibuya Station every day, waiting for his owner's return.
** Regulars at the train station grew attached to Hachikou and provided him with food. Similarly, Thoma attempts to provide Shoushou with food after seeing him at the same spot every day.
* Inu Shoushou will not spawn unless Thoma's Hangout Event is in progress. However, players are able to spawn him at anytime by repeating his branch of Thoma's quest, where he will spawn on the beach until the quest "Ninken by the Shore" is completed.
