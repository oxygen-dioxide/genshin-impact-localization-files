==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bounama:''' Shh, you have to keep your voice down here.
:'''Bounama:''' If there's anything you want to buy, just go ahead and take it, then leave the money to one side.
:{{DIcon|Alchemy}} I'd like to use the Crafting Bench.
::'''Bounama:''' Feel free to use it if no one else is. No need to ask me first.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What are you selling?
::'''Bounama:''' See these, and... these? It's all here, so if anything's missing, it means we're out of stock.
:;(Opens [[Bounama's Grocery]] shop)
:{{DIcon}} What sort of effect would there be if I speak too loud?
::'''Bounama:''' That's a very good question.
::'''Bounama:''' Many people overlook environmental factors when they're making things, so the fact that you even thought of asking shows that you're well ahead of the game.
::'''Bounama:''' They all know that the amount of Spinel Fruit Powder you put in changes a potion's effect, and that drawing a talisman with an extra line can end up producing a completely different result.
::'''Bounama:''' So why don't they seem to understand that sound too can have an effect when crafting materials?
::{{DIcon}} I get where you're coming from, but our surroundings aren't quiet either...
::'''Bounama:''' Hmm?
::'''Bounama:''' ...Ah, well naturally, that's something that I've already taken into consideration!
::'''Bounama:''' I base everything I do here on my existing environment.
::'''Bounama:''' In the past, as people have come and gone, so too have a variety of different stories. These... Yes, these are also part of the production process.
::'''Bounama:''' As we Masters of the Night-Wind say: "All has been understood, and the future becomes the past."
:{{DIcon}} Aren't you afraid of losing stuff?
::'''Bounama:''' Ah, you might be asking the wrong question there, friend.
::'''Bounama:''' As soon as the idea of profiting from another's labor gets mentioned, even if we're talking about a morally upstanding individual, it's hard to prevent a bad seed from being planted.
::'''Bounama:''' But no matter. Anyway, we're just talking about a few odds and ends that the [[Mol Stone House]] sells on commission.
::'''Bounama:''' Even if one or two items go missing, all I have to do is draw a couple of prayer talismans and I'll have made my money back!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Bounama:''' Take care now, and step lightly.
