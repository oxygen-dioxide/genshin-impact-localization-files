==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Yaoyao's hair is braided and tied into a bow on top of her head. Her face is evenly framed by a set of neat bangs, with a pair of gold flower-shaped hairpins. Her hair is tied into two small buns, held together with a set of oversized golden jingle bells.

Yaoyao wears a yellow green overcoat with puffed up sleeves secured around the wrists with orange bows. She wears this over a dark brown collared tunic and belt and short pleated skirt with ruffles decorated with golden flowers. She has a large orange pouch with a large tassel around her waist just above her skirt, decorated with an emblem resembling that of a flower. Yaoyao wears a pair of white bloomers and a dark suit underneath, along with a pair of orange-toed white boots. Yaoyao also carries an oversized basket over her shoulder which is where her Dendro Vision is pinned to a red bow knot. The basket contains some tied white bags and one [[Yuegui]].
