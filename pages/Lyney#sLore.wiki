==Personality==
{{Quote|A famed Fontainian magician who possesses great stage presence as well as gift of the gab. Audiences are enthralled by his exquisite skills, and they hang on to his every clever word.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Lyney is a skilled magician who enjoys the showlight. He is, at first sight, very easygoing and friendly compared to his siblings [[Lynette]] and [[Freminet]], who are reserved and introverted respectively, though he is said to be much quieter when alone with his sister. He and his sister are talented magicians, having learned from [[Cesar]] in their youth when they were living on the streets. Lyney remembers all of the people that he is indebted to and will repay their kindness, as shown with [[Arlecchino]], Cesar, [[Chiori]] and the [[Traveler]].

Though it is not said directly, it is implied that he does have some feline traits like his sister such as his eyes, his love for fish and a wish to sleep more in the morning. His tendency to be both intimate yet reserved also gives him a mysterious aura often related to cats. His constellation also has the word "cat" in it, just like Lynette. However, these traits are not as pronounced as his sister, as he appears just like a normal person and does not share her increased senses of hearing, taste and smell.

He cares greatly for his siblings, wanting to ensure that they have a home to live in and looks out for them whenever possible, becoming extremely irrational should their safety be threatened. This is to such an extent he would even be willing to face his own "Father" in a duel, knowing he could never beat her.  Despite all his cheer, Lyney has a dark and traumatic past with his sister, but they have a very good relationship, likening it to the only truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods. As a result, he is willing to do anything to stay with her. Lyney is also implied to quite prideful, wanting to prove himself to others.

Lyney uses the [[:Category:Medium Male Characters|medium male]] model. He is a young man with violet eyes, pale skin, and short ash blond hair, some locks being pulled back in a small braid on the left side of his head. He also has bangs with a small pinkish red strand on the right, covering almost a quarter of his face. Additionally, he has cat-like eyes thanks to their overall shape and their slit pupils. He also has a dark brown tear-shaped mark on his right cheek.

{{Quote|Sometimes it distracts with a feint, others it pretends to slip up and reveal a flaw... When things get serious, sleight of hand dazzles more than the magic itself. Can you guess what it is?|A riddle Lynette set for her younger brother Freminet while blowing on the surface of her tea.}}
With the possible exception of the trials held at the Opera Epiclese, Lyney and Lynette's magic show is without a doubt the best live performance in the Court of Fontaine.

Judgment uses truth to deliver justice. Magic uses facade to reach people's hearts.

Even if the whole audience knows that everything that takes place on stage is simply trickery and deception, they'll still be dazzled when they're brought face to face with a miracle. Long before the magician's elegant curtain call, the thunder of the cheering and applause will be deafening.

On stage, Lyney is a Great Magician in the eyes of all. Off stage, he's a reliable older brother, courteous visitor, and devoted friend.

His every move is a pleasant surprise, every word a reason to smile. His whole being is like an indecipherable enigma that you just can't help trying to solve.

If you suddenly find yourself so close to him that you're confiding your innermost thoughts, don't be too surprised.

After all, what is a magician if not an expert in stealing hearts?

{{Quote|In the end, a child must grow up, and they must surpass their parents. Only thus may a family flourish. When that day comes... I look forward to hearing what 'family' means to him.|[[Arlecchino]]}}
Magic is a lie. Nothing but evasion, deception, and trickery.

Even a single illusion requires a series of lies to pull off. To put on a whole magic show, you must win the audience's trust by weaving a seamless facade of ruses and ploys.

Props, lighting, assistants, planning... the stage is set through the help of countless aids, both onstage and off. A magician's performance rests upon so much painstaking effort, yet is also weighed down by the burden of expectation.

As such, a magician's design must be absolutely airtight, and his execution without flaw &mdash; even a single slip-up could ruin everything. He must not let his "family" down...

"...The magician's lies must not be exposed."

The first time Lyney stepped onto the stage, he had a mission on his mind as he stood there behind the curtain, muttering "Father's" words under his breath.

"Lyney..." said Lynette as she squeezed her brother's palm unconsciously.

The curtain slowly began to rise, marking the start of their performance. Lyney raised up Lynette's arm and gazed back at her with a determined look in his eyes.

"I'll be alright &mdash; because as always, Lynette's by my side."

              --><p>Even from an early age, performance was something closely tied to Lyney's life. Each time he would go on stage, Lyney would have the audience whooping and clapping. And yet, he did not lose himself in their adulation &mdash; if anything, it often troubled him.</p><!--
              --><p>If audiences were simply drawn to the spectacle of magic, then who was to say that they wouldn't abandon Lyney's stage as soon as they caught wind of a more enthralling show in town?</p><!--

              --><p>In all of Lyney's performances afterward, audiences would begin to notice a change &mdash; Lyney would add many segments between performances in which he would interact with them.</p><!--

              --><p>Yet no one would quibble about these white lies. After all, truth and falsehoods were already inextricable in many parts of the performance &mdash; why, even the magician himself could be said to have become a part of the magic.</p><!--

              --><p>Lyney did not need to ask his sister to know that she would never accept his desire to stay by her side with the use of a Delusion. It was only then that he realized the absurdity of his wish.</p><!--
              --><p>"Father" stood up and left, but not before reminding him that this was not the first time he had lacked power, but that he had found an answer before.</p><!--
              --><p>Lyney would lock himself in his room, trying to digest the reasoning behind the words "Father" had left him with. When he and his sister had been out on the streets, the answer he had found then had been "magic." What, then, would the answer be now?</p><!--
              --><p>Lyney found the dossiers for all the missions Lynette had taken up during this period, carefully analyzing the process of each one and modeling his sister's every action.</p><!--
              --><p>Was it really necessary to pass through this dangerous valley to get close to a target?</p><!--
              --><p>Was it really a must to leap into such a swift river to flee the scene?</p><!--
              --><p>No, this was just the Vision's light covering her.</p><!--
              --><p>Thus did Lyney start to make comprehensive plans for his sister's missions, using his understanding of her to design the most suitable routes, make the most practical tools, and choose the best rendezvous points.</p><!--
              --><p>The trust between them did not change. The look in Lynette's eyes when she left was no longer so strained, and they often embraced heartily and happily when meeting at the rendezvous point.</p><!--
              --><p>The pure desire to protect one's family would not be moved, gods' favor or no.</p><!--
              --><p>But even the best laid plans of mice and men may go awry. After conducting dozens of successful missions, the children of the Hotel were caught up in a betrayal, and as a result, Lynette's movements were exposed.</p><!--
              --><p>Before the siblings was a towering cliff, just like the night when Lynette had gained her Vision &mdash; but this time, it was Lyney's turn to reverse their fortunes in a moment of crisis.</p><!--
              --><p>He opened his emergency paraglider, and grabbing her, threw himself off the edge. But their pursuers followed, raining gunfire down on them.</p><!--
              --><p>Lyney twisted this way and that, avoiding many a shot, but still the glider was punctured in several spots. Unable to maintain balance, they began to plummet downward towards the embrace of the ground below.</p><!--
              --><p>Still, Lyney grit his teeth and refused to despair &mdash; should fate itself conspire to refute the answer he had come up with to protect his family, he would defy it to the end.</p><!--
              --><p>Their pursuers began to snicker, knowing that a fall at such speeds would be fatal &mdash; only to have a flame light up the skies, pushing the stricken glider toward a fast-flowing river nearby.</p><!--
              --><p>The power of Pyro changed the direction of their fall, while Anemo defended them from harm &mdash; and thus did the twin lights intertwine and spread under the moonlight, fading slowly like the applause that fills the stage during a curtain call.</p><!--
              --><p>Lyney did not guess at the meaning of the shining Vision he saw in his hand. The answer was, after all, no longer important.</p>
