:'''Ferrylady:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Um... Hello?
::'''Ferrylady:''' ...
::{{DIcon}} ...Is she okay?
::'''Ferrylady:''' ...are you... are you accosting me?
::'''Ferrylady:''' In Liyue it's generally not customary for people to speak to those of us from Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
::'''Ferrylady:''' Therefore... you must be outlanders. Or are you... something else?
::{{DIcon}} You're right, we're not from here.
:::'''Ferrylady:''' I see. Hello.
:::'''Ferrylady:''' I serve the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Come to think of it, I haven't spoken to anyone that isn't from there in a long time.
:::'''Ferrylady:''' Even when I'm working, I don't speak to the family of those who have passed out of respect for the old customs.
:::'''Ferrylady:''' When night falls, the family leaves out what is necessary and a few things to eat, and then retire to their rooms where they shut the doors tight. I then go about my business silently, preparing the ashes before taking my leave.
:::'''Ferrylady:''' So for someone to speak to me, especially at night, is nigh on unheard of. Please forgive me, I was not ignoring you intentionally.
::{{DIcon}} We probably count as "something else."
:::'''Ferrylady:''' ...could it be?
:::'''Ferrylady:''' I stare death straight in the eye when others dare not.
:::'''Ferrylady:''' I have nothing to do with what has led you here.
:::'''Ferrylady:''' I have nothing to do with where you shall go.
:::'''Ferrylady:''' Go, lost soul. Into the light.
