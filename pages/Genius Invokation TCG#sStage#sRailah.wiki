;(Talk to Railah)
:'''Railah:''' Because this occurs, that too must...
:'''Railah:''' We need not say more. Knowledge and execution are closely linked anyway. Well then, let's play.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Let's play Genius Invokation TCG.
:;(Open Genius Invokation TCG challenge interface)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Railah:''' Don't worry, we will meet again. And when that happens, let's have a good match of wits and wisdom.

;(If the player loses the match)
:'''Railah:''' I see, I see... Beating you has provided me with significant inspiration for my research.

;(If the player wins the match)
:'''Railah:''' Huh. So that's how it is... I may have lost, but my research has benefited greatly.
