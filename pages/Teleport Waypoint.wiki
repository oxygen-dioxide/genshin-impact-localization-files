{{Description|Odd devices that are scattered across Teyvat, seemingly forming a certain order. People on the continent see them as ancient gimmicks &mdash; they are accustomed to their existence despite not knowing their purpose. To the foreign [[traveler]], however, their function becomes quite apparent.|[[Map]] Description}}
'''Teleport Waypoints''' are structures players can find and unlock throughout the world of [[Teyvat]]. When a player first unlocks them they are granted {{Item|Adventure EXP|30|x=50}} and {{Item|Primogem|30|x=5}}. Selecting a Teleport Waypoint on the [[Map]] allows the player fast travel to their location. The location of the Teleport Waypoint on the map usually show the [[Area]] it is a part of.

[[Statues of The Seven]] and [[Domain]]s, including Event Domains, also act as Waypoints and can be fast traveled to upon being unlocked. Players can refer to [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=3 Teyvat Interactive Map] for their locations.

==Overview==
In addition to allowing fast travel, Teleport Waypoints also:
* Serve as respawn locations after a player's party dies.
** Only unlocked Teleport Waypoints can do this.
** In Co-Op Mode, the player is teleported to the location of the nearest Teleport Waypoint that they have unlocked in their own world, even if it has not been unlocked in the host's world. This applies even if it is currently impossible for the host to unlock that Teleport Waypoint, such as if the area in the host's world is physically blocked or otherwise cannot be accessed normally, if the Teleport Waypoint is locked<!-- as in, it has the same seal found around locked chests -->, or if the Teleport Waypoint does not yet exist.
* Serve as [[sources of warmth]] in [[Subzero Climate]]s, such as in [[Dragonspine]].
* Recharge the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]]'s energy in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]].
* Reduce accumulated Decay in [[Withering Zone]]s in [[Sumeru]].
* Replenish [[Phlogiston]] in [[Natlan]] regions where it is enabled.

==Unlocking==
Most Teleport Waypoints need to be unlocked by interacting with them. The location of most locked Waypoints can be seen on the [[Map]] once the area they are in is lit up, which is done by touching a [[Statue of The Seven]] on the Map of Teyvat and through other means, such as quest progression, in other maps. A navigation pointer will indicate a locked Teleport Waypoint's direction on the screen if the player is within 30 meters of it and then disappears if the player unlocks the Teleport Waypoint or is not within 40 meters of it.

===Additional Prerequisites===
Some Teleport Waypoints do not show up on the Map when locked, even when the area they are in is lit up, until another requirement is completed:

|}

Other pins on the map may also provide a teleport button when selected, but unlike the ones listed above, they will teleport the player to the nearest Statue of the Seven or Teleport Waypoint instead of directly to that location.

==Temporary Teleport Waypoints==
Some Teleport Waypoints were introduced in [[Event]]-exclusive areas, and therefore were only accessible for limited amount of time.
* The [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] had 7 Teleport Waypoints during [[Version 1.6]] and 10 during [[Version 2.8]].
** Both times, four of these Teleport Waypoints acted like [[Statues of The Seven]] in the way that they lit up parts of the map.
* The [[Three Realms Gateway Offering (Area)|Darkness-Encroached Enkanomiya]] had 10 Teleport Waypoints during [[Version 2.5]].
** Nine of these were originally [[Corrupted Waypoint|corrupted]] and required 5 [[Tokoyo Legume]] and 5 [[Aphotium Ore]] to [[Three Realms Gateway Offering#Rite of Diffusal|unlock]].
* The [[Veluriyam Mirage]] had 9 Teleport Waypoints during [[Version 3.8]].
* The [[Simulanka]] had 17 Teleport Waypoints during [[Version 4.8]].

===Automatic Unlocks===
Just like some permanent waypoints, some temporary Teleport Waypoints in Event areas were automatically unlocked upon completing certain quest steps:
{| class="fandom-table"

|-
|[[Midsummer Island Adventure]] / [[Version 1.6]]

|-

|-
|[[Summertide Scales and Tales]]
|At the entrance southest of [[Forest of Blessings]]
|Unlocked during ''[[The Story Begins in a Forest Without Rain]]''
|}

==Other Types of Waypoints==
===Portable Waypoints===
{{Main|Portable Waypoint}}
'''Portable Waypoints''' are items that function similarly to Teleport Waypoints, except they can be summoned and placed anywhere by the user and only last a set amount of time.

===Sub-Space Waypoints===
{{Main|Sub-Space Waypoint}}
'''Sub-Space Waypoints''' are [[furnishing]]s that function similarly to Teleport Waypoints. They can be placed anywhere in a player's [[Serenitea Pot]].

===Realm Waypoint: A Place to Return To===
{{Main|Realm Layout#Realm Waypoint: A Place to Return To}}
'''Realm Waypoint: A Place to Return To''' is a waypoint existing in the first area of every [[Realm Layout]].

==Lore==
The canonicity of Teleport Waypoints is unclear.

The item description, map description, and existence of Portable Waypoints suggest that Teleport Waypoints are at least understood as teleportation devices and that only their inner workings are unknown.

This conflicts with the Teleport Waypoint description, which says that the people of Teyvat do not even know the purpose of the Teleport Waypoints and only view them as "ancient gimmicks."

This, in turn, conflicts with the Event Quest ''[[Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown]]'', during which Paimon, Barbara, and Jean display no recognition of the first Teleport Waypoint "device" they encounter on the Golden Apple Archipelago. Paimon even compares the "device" to a Portable Waypoint. This is incongruous due to the presence of numerous identical Teleport Waypoints throughout Mondstadt, including one in the city's main plaza that is on its own platform on grass and has its own path paved to it.

Later, in the Archon Quest ''[[In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion]]'', Paimon compares Dainsleif's explanation of the [[Abyss]]'s portals, which he concludes are gateways to an entire network, to Teleport Waypoints. This is not further expanded upon.

===Katheryne===
Given the likely unusual circumstances surrounding [[Katheryne]] as well as her prominent role in gameplay affairs, the information she gives about teleportation must be considered separately.

Katheryne in Inazuma asks the Traveler, "I thought you knew how to use Teleport Waypoints?" during ''[[Katheryne in Inazuma]]'', the quest that unlocks [[Commissions]] in [[Inazuma]]. This question was asked after she claimed to be joking about using a teleportation tool.

Katheryne in Liyue, who had previously told the Traveler that she would be waiting for them on Narukami Island during ''[[Setting Sail]]'', later claimed to have drawn a fortune slip at "the shrine," presumably in Inazuma, during ''[[In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion]]''. At Paimon's surprise, Katheryne explained that she, too, has a private life.

The suggestion that all Katherynes are the same and can also teleport or otherwise engage in fast travel is a departure from ''[[New Horizons of Adventure]]'', the quest that unlocks Commissions in [[Liyue]], which suggests that all Katherynes look alike but are separate entities.

==Trivia==
* A message stating "Teleport Waypoint unlocked" appears when interacting with a Teleport Waypoint, common [[Domain]] entrance or [[Statue of The Seven]] for the first time, although this message may also appear in other cases:
** After completing Quests which unlocks access to a Domain as a reward.
** After completing certain [[Archon Quest]] steps, which does not actually unlock any location that the player may choose to teleport to, but instead acts as a checkpoint where the party will be revived if all the characters [[Fallen Characters|fall]], similarly to a [[Door of Resurrection]].
* All teleportation locations are typically some distance away from enemies' routes and are therefore "safe" to idle at after teleporting. Notable exceptions include:
** The Teleport Waypoint west of [[Dawn Winery]]: a group of Cryo Slimes located by the riverbank may get close enough to spot the player.
** The Teleport Waypoint at the southern exit of [[Starglow Cavern]]: a nearby group of idle hilichurls will always spot the player a few seconds after teleporting.
** The Teleport Waypoint in the bamboo forest southwest of [[Qingce Village]]: a nearby boar often charges at the arriving player upon loading.
** The [[Statue of The Seven]] of [[Dihua Marsh]]: a group of Hydro Slimes located near the water may get close enough to spot the player.
* [[Tsurumi Island]]'s [[fog]] prevents the usage of its Teleport Waypoints by hiding them on the [[Map]], even if the player previously unlocked them. They will however be accessible again after the fog is cleared without requiring to be unlocked again.
* The Teleport Waypoint near the east of [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], [[Enkanomiya]], currently has the furthest distance between the waypoint and the players' actual spawn location when compared to other Teleport Waypoints.
* There is an upside-down Teleport Waypoint in [[Nameless Ruins]], [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] that cannot be unlocked normally if players are standing at the ground level.
* During the [[Nilou]] step of the {{Quest|Jnagarbha Day}}, the player cannot see or use any Teleport Waypoints on the Map.
* In certain cases, such as the Teleport Waypoints west of [[Erinnyes Forest]]'s Statue Of The Seven, east of [[Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale]]'s Statue Of The Seven and east of [[Tequemecan Valley]]'s Statue Of The Seven, will be unlocked automatically after completing the [[Song of the Dragon and Freedom|Archon Quest Prologue: Act III "Song of the Dragon and Freedom."]]
