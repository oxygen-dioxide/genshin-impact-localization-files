{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Acat:''' Welcome. Given that most people are unable to describe the exact color they want, I suggest you bring some reference material with you.
:{{DIcon}} Color, you say?
::'''Acat:''' Of course. You're not in the wrong place, are you? We sell paints in this shop, not colorful drinks.
::'''Acat:''' If you bring me a sample, I can mix you a paint of the exact same color.
::'''Acat:''' Or to err on the side of caution, perhaps I should say... I can mix a color that's ninety-nine percent the same.
::{{DIcon}} Very interesting. What's your trick?
::'''Acat:''' Of course, it's down to talent.
::'''Acat:''' Just like how some people won't get lost even when they're in a totally new place, I'm a natural when it comes to color.
::'''Acat:''' As I see it, there's no such thing as ugly colors, just ugly combinations. Even the hue of rotten fruit will shine in the right context.
::'''Acat:''' Speaking of which, your eyes are a lovely color... In fact, I'm going to try mixing it later.
:{{DIcon}} I'll do so if needed in the future.
::'''Acat:''' Oh, no problem.
