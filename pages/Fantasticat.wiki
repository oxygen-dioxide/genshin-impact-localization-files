'''Fantasticat''' is [[Lyney]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Lyney wears an ornate black top hat with magenta details, a striped magenta-and-purple ribbon tied in a bow, a bronze chain, and his cat motif as decorations. He wears a sleeveless white ruffled shirt, over which sits a black corset-like piece with two layered long tails, the top layer black with black details and the bottom layer magenta with black pinstripes and with a magenta diamond-print lining. He has detached white sleeves and white gloves that are black at his middle phalanges up to his finger tips, and his thumbs.

The corset-like article is attached to his shorts, which have a diagonal ruff running from higher on the right to lower on the left. These shorts are attached to garters, which also hold up his black socks.  A short harness of brown straps is fastened across his front and back, and wears a black and magenta  half-capelet on his right shoulder, with a magenta rosette ribbon bearing his signature cat motif pinned at the bottom. This half-capelet is fastened around his neck by a purple collar, closed with two layered magenta and striped bows at the front. At the back of his waist is a big black bow, on which he bears a {{Pneuma}}-aligned {{Pyro}} [[Vision]].
