|vo_05_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Romaritime Flower.ogg
|vo_05_02_tx         = "Romaritime Flower" is the pen name I use for writing in Beautes en fleurs. It was actually chosen by a vote. My Melusine friends and I put our heads together and came up with three options, then we put them up on the bulletin board and got everyone to vote on them. So that was proof that by human standards, Romaritime Flower fits better with a beauty and skincare theme than um, "[[Sternshield Crab]]" or "[[Bubbler Seahorse]]."

Later, I gave you a box of candies... that had some pills mixed in, and a recipe change so they wouldn't taste too strong. ...Oh, they were still bitter? You could tell right away, huh... Well, you still took them, so thank you for trusting me. I'll keep looking out for your health in the future. Just keep being a good patient, and take your medicine when you're told to.

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = Having a Vision helps me remove obstacles getting in the way of my work, which frees up valuable time to look after my patients. What kind of obstacles? Well, in my experience... sometimes, I get nasty characters trying to stop me from treating someone. And other times, it's the patients themselves &mdash; some people can be really uncooperative... But those are extreme cases. Most of the time, I prefer using my Vision to make lots of floaty, colorful bubbles. They always cheer me up, and they liven up the atmosphere &mdash; I have loads of great photos of me and my Melusine friends surrounded by bubbles.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = Humans become very vulnerable when they get sick. I've seen lots of huge guys who boast about their skills in the [[Pankration Ring]] suddenly look at me like a frightened [[Blubberbeast]] when they find out they need an injection. I always make sure to bring plenty of candies and stickers to make them feel better when the waterworks start. It's really effective &mdash; a little treat always wipes the doom and gloom away.

|vo_07_03_tx         = Do you like going swimming? It's really nice around the Fortress of Meropide, so dark and murky. I bet you'd love it too... Wait, your eyebrow muscles are contracting, which means you're feeling uncomfortable... Okay, got it &mdash; let's go diving at the [[Salacia Plain]] instead! It's been so long since I saw the [[Leisurely Otter]]s playing. I could watch them all day. But please make sure you don't harm them, and don't steal their shells.

|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Neuvillette - Respect.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = Monsieur Neuvillette was the one who brought the Melusines to the [[Court of Fontaine]] and found jobs for us to do. Together, we integrated into [[Fontaine]] society and learned about the wonders of humanity. I have huge respect for him, and I really like humans too. Hmm? Who would I save first if Monsieur Neuvillette and a human fell into the water? Well, that's easy. He'd definitely help me bring the human safely to shore.

|vo_08_02_tx         = We Melusines are Monsieur Neuvillette's familiars, but that doesn't mean he shows us any favor beyond what is fair and legal. I willingly accepted when he put me on trial, and I fully agreed with his verdict. I remember the day I left for the Fortress of Meropide, it was raining really hard. But I didn't feel like the raindrops were cold at all. They were warm and gentle, just like the way Monsieur Neuvillette looks at me...
|vo_08_02_mention    = Neuvillette

|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Wriothesley.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = The Duke has the highest pain tolerance of anyone I've ever met. He wasn't always big and strong like he is now, but even in the beginning, he'd always refuse an anesthetic injection when he came to the infirmary to get stitches. He'd say something about wanting to keep a sharp mind, or something. I thought to myself, wow, what an impressive little grown-up he is. He's gone on to become an equally impressive big grown-up, too.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Wriothesley

|vo_08_04_tx         = Miss Clorinde doesn't make a lot of facial expressions when she talks. It's pretty difficult to tell what mood she's in from what her face is doing... She used the lipstick I gave her? Really? Hee-hee, I'm so glad she likes it! I knew that color would go great on her!

|vo_08_05_tx         = The Fontaine Beauty Association holds regular meetings, and I really appreciate getting the chance to chat with everyone there. Most people, when I compliment them, just blush, lower their head, and try to brush it off. But Navia's different &mdash; she's always very happy to receive praise, and then she comes to shake my hand and take a photo with me as a souvenir. She's like a shining yellow rose who lights up the world around her, and whether it's daytime or nighttime, sunny or gloomy, she always looks dazzling.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Navia

|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Charlotte.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = I love looking at Charlotte's photos. You get to see what everyone's facial muscles do in all sorts of different situations: tensed up, relaxed, stretching up, drooping down... Hehe, I remember them all very fondly.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Charlotte

|vo_08_07_tx         = I still feel sorry for firing that tranquilizer shot at Mr. Lyney... It was an emergency situation, and that was the least harmful way of incapacitating him... Thankfully, he was okay with letting me take care of Mr. [[Freminet]] once he understood that I bore them no ill will.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Lyney,Freminet

|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Lynette.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = Lynette is cute two times over: human-being-cute, and kitty-cute! After observing her a little bit, I noticed that her ears lean forward when she's having tea and cake. Hee-hee, I just wanna stroke her on the head... You too? Why don't we ask her for permission next time?
|vo_08_08_mention    = Lynette

|vo_08_09_tx         = He made a point of coming to thank me after he recovered &mdash; what a lovely boy. He speaks so quietly, though... He probably doesn't go out of his way to talk to other people much. But I could tell that he has a rich and detailed inner world, because he looked so captivated as he was looking through some Melusines' paintings.
|vo_08_09_mention    = Freminet

|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Chiori.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = Melusines have different bodies than human beings, so it's hard to find clothes that fit. Even for me &mdash; I never know what to do with my tail when I'm trying on human clothes... But luckily, Chiori offers a Melusine tailoring service, so now all my Melusine friends have the chance to wear the pretty clothes they love.
|vo_08_10_mention    = Chiori

|vo_08_11_tx         = I always see Miss Emilie's perfumes being recommended in beauty magazines. So I've hatched a plan. The next time I take a vacation, I'm gonna cut my visit to the [[Palais Mermonia]] a little short, so I can take some time to go shopping in the Court of Fontaine. I'm gonna buy loads and loads of Emilie's perfumes to bring back and give to all the lovely little girls here, hee-hee.

|vo_09_02_tx         = A lot of illnesses are things that build up over a long time, that's why it's so important to take good care of yourself day to day. Sadly, not a lot of people seem to understand that. Why do they force themselves to keep working in the production zone, when it's obvious that they're so tired they can barely keep their eyes open? I always sneak them some extra food, but beyond a point, if they aren't gonna do what's good for them and get some proper rest, they leave me with no choice. I have to resort to more extreme therapeutic measures, like my Tranquilizer Gun. *sigh* There's more to life than [[Credit Coupons]]... People need to learn to go easier on themselves.

Sometimes we talk about recent criminal cases, other times we discuss the latest skincare products recommended in the magazines, but most of the time we do painting together.

|vo_09_04_tx         = Once upon a time in Fontaine, humans and Melusines didn't get along like they do today. Some people feared and hated us because they heard that we were born from the body of [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]]... Others didn't trust Monsieur Neuvillette, and by extension they didn't trust us Melusines either... And maybe some of them were just subconsciously wary of us because we looked different... Back then, it was really difficult to make human friends. So I really treasured that one little girl who knew I was a Melusine but was still willing to hold my little round hand...

Doctors aren't gods, I know that &mdash; even the best doctors will come up against incurable diseases in their time. But that's okay. We Melusines have very long lives, so as long as I never stop studying medicine, the range of illnesses I can cure can only keep increasing, and the amount of suffering can only keep decreasing. I'll always follow my teacher's example, doing everything in my power to save the people I can reach... As long as it will help, and as long as I'm not harming anyone in the process, I'm willing to use any means necessary to treat my patients, whatever the risk to myself.

|vo_10_01_tx         = Out of all the books I've ever read, [[The Meaning of Laughter]] is my favorite. Not only is it a fun read, it also helps me when I diagnose patients. Like, when someone comes out of the Pankration Ring and they're laughing with their mouth but the rest of their facial muscles are all contorted, it means that they're doing it to cover up the pain from taking a beating. If you ever meet someone doing that, you should subtly hint for them to come to me and get patched up. But remember, the subtlety is important. Otherwise, it takes away the meaning of their laughter, hehe.
