'''Parties''' are teams of up to four [[Characters]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. Parties can benefit from [[Elemental Resonance]], but it requires a full party of four. During trial character stages, a special case occurs where the party may be expanded to five characters if the player already has a full party of four which does not include the specific trial character, with the fifth character being said trial character.

The cooldown for switching between characters is 1 second. If attempting to switch multiple times too quickly, the screen will say that the character switching is in cooldown. The ability to change parties is unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 2.

==Switching Characters==
When switching between characters, some effects from [[Talents]], [[Constellations]], [[Weapons]], and [[Artifacts]] may not remain once the active character has left the field.

Most [[Food]] effects do not apply to characters in the party that are owned by other players.

==Trivia==
* In Version ???, there was a bug that allowed the usage for 5 characters in a party through revival. This bug is related to the fact that the game's party system supports up to 5 characters to accommodate a fifth trial character when using a full party of four in a trial character stage.
