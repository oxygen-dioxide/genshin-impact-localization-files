'''Parties''' are teams of up to four [[Characters]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. Parties can benefit from [[Elemental Resonance]], but it requires a full party of four. During trial character stages, a special case occurs where the party may be expanded to five characters if the player already has a full party of four which does not include the specific trial character, with the fifth character being said trial character.

The cooldown for switching between characters is 1 second. If attempting to switch multiple times too quickly, the screen will say that the character switching is in cooldown. The ability to change parties is unlocked after completing the {{Quest|Unexpected Power}}.

==Party Setup==
The '''Party Setup''' menu is accessed from the [[Paimon Menu]], by pressing {{Key|P}} on PC, or holding a character on the right side of the screen. Characters are added to the team composition from left to right. A team composed of zero characters cannot be deployed. There are 4 default team compositions with the names "Party 1," "Party 2," "Party 3," and "Party 4." Default team compositions can be renamed but cannot be disbanded. New team compositions are given the default name of "Team Standing By." The deployed team composition cannot be disbanded. A maximum of 10 team compositions can be created. The positions of characters in the team composition can be rearranged by holding and dragging over the character to swap positions with. Team compositions can be switched between by clicking the left and right arrows at the edges of the screen.

The '''Configure Team''' menu displays a list of all team compositions, with their name, [[character]]s, and [[element]]s. It allows the player to create new team compositions, disband, and quickly switch between them.

The '''Quick Setup''' menu allows the player to quickly select, deselect, or rearrange characters.

==Switching Characters==
When switching between characters, some effects from [[Talent]]s, [[Constellation]]s, [[Weapon]]s, and [[Artifact]]s may not remain once the active character has left the field.

Most [[Food]] effects do not apply to characters in the party that are owned by other players.

==Trivia==
* In Version ???, there was a bug that allowed the usage for 5 characters in a party through revival. This bug is related to the fact that the game's party system supports up to 5 characters to accommodate a fifth trial character when using a full party of four in a trial character stage.
