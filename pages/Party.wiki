'''Parties''' are teams of up to four [[Characters]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. Parties can benefit from [[Elemental Resonance]], but it requires a full party of four. During trial character stages, a special case occurs where the party may be expanded to five characters if the player already has a full party of four which does not include the specific trial character, with the fifth character being said trial character.

The cooldown for switching between characters is '''1''' second. If attempting to switch multiple times too quickly, the screen will say that the character switching is in cooldown. The ability to change parties is unlocked after completing the {{Quest|Unexpected Power}}.

==Party Setup==
The '''Party Setup''' menu is accessed from the [[Paimon Menu]], by pressing {{Key|L}} on PC, or holding a character on the right side of the screen. Characters are added to the team composition from left to right. A team composed of zero characters cannot be deployed. There are 4 default team compositions with the names "Party 1," "Party 2," "Party 3," and "Party 4." Default team compositions can be renamed but cannot be disbanded. New team compositions are given the default name of "Team Standing By." The deployed team composition cannot be disbanded. A maximum of 15 team compositions can be created. The positions of characters in the team composition can be rearranged by holding and dragging over the character to swap positions with. Team compositions can be switched between by clicking the left and right arrows at the edges of the screen. When manually moving or introducing a character to the party, or when returning to the Party Setup menu from the character's details, the character will play a [[:Category:Character Party Setup GIFs|unique animation]].

The '''Configure Team''' menu displays a list of all team compositions, with their name, [[character]]s, and [[element]]s. It allows the player to create new team compositions, disband, and quickly switch between them.

The '''Quick Setup''' menu allows the player to quickly select, deselect, or rearrange characters.

The menu's background will change depending on which region the player is when accessing the menu, as long as the setting "The background of the Party Setup screen will change based on your current region" in the "Others" tab is set to "On," if not it will use the "Default" background at all times:

Most [[Food]] effects do not apply to characters in the party that are owned by other players.

==Trivia==
* In [[Version 1.0]], there was a bug that allowed the usage for 5 characters in a party through revival. This bug is related to the fact that the game's party system supports up to 5 characters to accommodate a fifth trial character when using a full party of four in a trial character stage.
* Many characters are accompanied by an ordinary object, an elemental object, a companion, or temporary special effects in their Party Setup menu animation. A few types of effects appear to be notable and reserved for certain characters:
** [[Venti]], [[Zhongli]], the [[Raiden Shogun]], and [[Nahida]] are the only characters who are accompanied by persistent non-object elemental or element-colored special effects after their animation finishes playing.
** [[Charlotte]] and [[Tartaglia]] are the only characters whose outfits remain in a non-default state after their animation finishes playing.<!-- Xiao's mask at his waist is... still there --> Charlotte's non-default state is caused by Monsieur Verite's removal from Charlotte's waist, while Tartaglia's non-default state is caused by his scarf's [[Foul Legacy: Raging Tide|Melee Stance]]-only appearance.
