'''Realm Currency''' is used to exchange for items in the Realm Depot through [[Tubby]] and the Traveling Depot through [[Chubby]].

Realm currency is collected from Tubby and is found at the bottom of the [[Trust Rank]] screen next to the trust rank rewards. Realm Currency generates over time at a rate between 4/hour and 30/hour depending on the amount of [[Adeptal Energy]] the player has in their realm.

There is a maximum amount of realm currency Tubby can hold (2400 at Trust Rank 10, which accumulates in 80 hours at 20,000 Adeptal Energy). When it is maxed, there is a sidebar on the player's map stating "Maximum Realm Currency".
