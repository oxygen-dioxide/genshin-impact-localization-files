{{Quest Description|Masrur at Port Ormos is currently worrying himself sick over a letter with an unclear address...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Masrur in Port Ormos)
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 masrur 01.ogg}} '''Masrur:''' Huh? Wait, you're that blond traveler who's on a journey to all corners of Teyvat, right?
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who's asking...? Do you need something from us?
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 masrur 02.ogg}} '''Masrur:''' You bet I do! Phew, I was worried I wouldn't be able to find you! I have a letter for you, you see &mdash; it's from another outlander...
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 masrur 03.ogg}} '''Masrur:''' He was a crafty fellow, lemme tell you... Took advantage of a loophole in our mailing system by opting for Guaranteed Delivery then filling in the most obscure mailing address I've ever seen!
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we are always on the road, so yeah, it's pretty tough to get mail to us unless we happen to go to the post office on a whim...
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, um... what address did that person give you, anyway?
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 masrur 04.ogg}} '''Masrur:''' Uh... he just wrote, "next to a small, white-haired talking fairy."
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? So the address is Paimon!?
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 masrur 05.ogg}} '''Masrur:''' *sigh* Exactly, right? And if I'd failed to deliver the letter, I'd have been bound by regulation to compensate him...
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 masrur 06.ogg}} '''Masrur:''' Really, he got me good. I count myself very lucky that I ran into you here.
:{{DIcon}} Great. Well, lemme see this letter.
:{{DIcon}} Lemme see this letter. I'm really curious who could've sent it...
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 masrur 07.ogg}} '''Masrur:''' Of course, here it is. All yours!
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, Paimon wants to have a look, too!
::It's been a while. How have you been?<br><!--
-->I've heard that the two of you are traveling in [[Sumeru]],<br><!--
-->And I happen to be in Port Ormos on official business.<br><br><!--
-->Lately, I've been stopping by Djafar Tavern for a drink or two every afternoon.<br><!--
-->If luck's on my side, and this letter successfully reaches you...<br><!--
-->Come to me then and we can catch up on old times.<br><!--
-->We'll see it as a fated encounter.<br><br><!--
-->&mdash; Your Trusty Buddy, Kaeya
:{{Color|menu|You noticed that Kaeya's name was signed on the letter.}}
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaeya, huh? So he's here in Sumeru... Hmm, now that Paimon thinks about it, "crafty" does describe him pretty well.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah. Can't say I'm hugely surprised.
:{{DIcon}} This is definitely Kaeya's style.
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' From what he wrote in the letter, it looks like he didn't think there was much chance of it reaching us...
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, or maybe he's just being sneaky... Do you think he's making this sound like a miracle of fate so that we'd have to go meet up with him?
:{{DIcon}} Very scheming indeed...
:{{DIcon}} Well, no harm done. It'll be nice to catch up with him.
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, yeah, you're right. It's always nice to see old friends!
:{{A|vo szaq201 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The letter says that he hangs out at Djafar Tavern every afternoon. Perhaps we should drop in on him then, huh?
:;(Obtain {{Item|Wine-Scented Letter}})

;(Talk to Masrur again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog szaq201 masrur 01.ogg}} '''Masrur:''' This was a first for me. It's a good thing luck was on my side...

;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo szaq201 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaeya should be at Djafar Tavern right now. Let's go see him!

;(Approach Kaeya at Djafar Tavern)
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...I'll have something I haven't tried yet, Boss.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 eymen 01.ogg}} '''Eymen:''' Um... Sorry, Sir, I'm afraid you've already tried every type of liquor we serve...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh? Well then, just the bill, please. It's just as well, I suppose. I do have other matters to attend to...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaeya! You're really here! Paimon half thought you were playing some sort of prank on us...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hey, Paimon, {{Traveler}}. Looks like the gods smile upon me after all. And come now, I wouldn't joke about wanting to see my good friends, haha...
:{{DIcon}} If you say so.
:{{DIcon}} We've missed you too.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second, you must be here on official business, right? What do you think you're doing, spending every afternoon drinking at the tavern? You itching for a lecture from Jean?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hahaha, not at all. The [[Jean|Acting Grand Master]] positively terrifies me. Why would I ever do anything that might displease her?
:{{DIcon}} Uh-huh... Very believable.
:{{DIcon}} You? Terrified? I don't buy it.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The truth is, I'm in Sumeru to learn about the alcohol industry here. So despite how it might look, I'm actually at Djafar Tavern for strictly business purposes.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Sumeru's spices are famous the world over, and it's long been rumored that this fine establishment was where a certain very popular spiced cocktail was invented.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' That's why the Knights sent me, their foremost expert in alcoholic beverages, to come and see if it is as good as the rumors say.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And how did that go?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So far so good... I'm already in talks with some spice merchants in [[Port Ormos]] about some potential collaboration.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that does sound like a great business opportunity. Guess [[Dawn Winery]] and Master [[Diluc]] are gonna make a tidy sum from this one too, huh?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves... Whether this lucrative opportunity gets passed along to Dawn Winery or not depends on how nice I'm feeling... Hahaha.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Using your job to settle personal grievances isn't very knightly, Captain!
:{{DIcon}} ...I'm guessing you've been to Sumeru before?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh? What makes you say that?
:{{DIcon}} You came to Sumeru all on your own. So you must be quite familiar with the place.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 11.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Very sharp of you... I wouldn't say I'm familiar, though. I just came here on the sly once, when I was very young.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 12.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And? Do continue...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 13.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Heh... Do I have to? When I said we could talk about the old times, digging up my past wasn't exactly what I had in mind...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry about it.
:{{DIcon}} You don't have to go into great detail.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 14.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, alright, since you're so interested... Like I said, I was very young then. Dawn Winery had only just taken me in.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 15.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I overheard my [[Crepus|adoptive father]] talk about sending a team of merchants to Sumeru during a business meeting.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 16.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I'm sure you'll agree that everyone's curious about their roots on some level. And my roots... They're in [[Khaenri'ah]], which is said to have been located deep underground somewhere near Sumeru.
:{{DIcon}} Khaenri'ah...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 17.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' And so I stowed myself away amidst the cargo, and silently joined the merchant delegation on their trip to Sumeru...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 18.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' But it wasn't long before the merchant delegation received news that I'd gone missing. Their leader promptly found me, and before I knew it, my adoptive father was dragging me back home by the ear...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 19.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' It was a short-lived adventure. Sorry I don't have a more thrilling story for you, hehe...
:{{DIcon}} Speaking of Khaenri'ah... How much do you know about it?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 20.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Honestly, not much. The only reason I knew that Khaenri'ah was near Sumeru is because I happened to read that in a book when I was young.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 21.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' My life had less and less to do with Khaenri'ah as I grew up, and so I started caring less as well.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 22.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I used to believe that I had inherited some sort of duty from my father...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 23.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' But then I began to wonder... Maybe my father left me in the peaceful land of [[Mondstadt]] for no other reason than simply to keep me alive...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 24.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' As well as ensuring that I'd be safely cut off from certain things... The thought that I might be able to actually live a happy life there must have been the icing on the cake.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 25.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...This is obviously all speculation. Simply put, I'm afraid that I'm not particularly in the know on this topic.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 26.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' These days, my surname, [[Alberich]], is probably the only link to Khaenri'ah that I have left.
:{{Color|menu|A familiar face joins your conversation.}}
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...One Death After Noon please, Boss.
:{{DIcon}} ...?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Tell me... what do you know about the significance of that name, "Alberich"?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' D&mdash;Dainsleif!?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 27.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Ah, you've decided to join us? I was wondering how long you planned on listening in. I believe I've seen you before in Mondstadt... Dainsleif, if I'm not mistaken?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' So you remember me. Then we are already acquainted, Kaeya Alberich... descendant of the [[Chlothar|Abyss Order's founder]].
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 28.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} The [[Abyss Order]]...?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I take it that you weren't aware of this until now, Kaeya, or you wouldn't have been so forthcoming with your surname.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 29.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh, my... that's quite a lot of baggage for a surname, isn't it? Though I must say, it does confirm an old suspicion of mine. I suppose that was why my father left me in Mondstadt after all...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I'm surprised that you take me at my word without the faintest hint of skepticism...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 30.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, perhaps what you told me just happens to answer some questions I carry in my memories. And, in any case... I recognize your eyes...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 31.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You're a pure-blood Khaenri'ahn, aren't you?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 06.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Very clever. Forgive me for being direct, but I sincerely hope this new knowledge doesn't change anything. If you've already let go of your ties to the past... then keep it that way.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaeya... You're not involved with the Abyss Order in any way, are you...?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 32.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hey, hold on now. This conversation has taken a rather sudden turn for the deadly serious... and I'm afraid that as someone from Mondstadt, I'm not accustomed to this sort of atmosphere...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 33.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So what if I know my ancestry? Do I strike you as the type who would be bound by that kind of thing?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 34.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Relax. I'll be just as delighted to hunt down the Abyss Order tomorrow as I have always been.
:{{DIcon}} I trust you, Kaeya.
:{{DIcon}} I think... I guess.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 35.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Either way, looks like we're out of time. I've got a spice merchant to meet in a minute, so I'll leave the three of you to carry on the conversation without me.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Well, alright then... You go do your thing, Kaeya.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 kaeya 36.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' See you 'round. And Dainsleif, no need to listen in from the sidelines next time we meet. Let me buy you a drink.
:{{Color|menu|Kaeya leaves.}}
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 07.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Hmph...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You don't really trust him, do you, Dain? You're both from Khaenri'ah, but you get on like oil and water...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 08.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The fact is, I still do not know him well. It would be meaningless for me to jump to conclusions.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 09.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' But can a person truly be unaffected by their ancestry? This remains to be seen.
:{{DIcon}} So, you said that an Alberich founded the Abyss Order?
:{{DIcon}} I thought my sibling was the founder...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 10b.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Well, I suspect that they call your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}} their {{MC|m=Princess|f=Prince}} precisely because there is a succession of sorts.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 12a.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 12b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so if {{MC|m=she|f=he}} was the founder, {{MC|m=she|f=he}}'d be the "{{MC|m=Queen|f=King}}," right?
:{{DIcon}} So what do you plan to do here in Sumeru?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 11.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I mean to investigate the "[[Loom of Fate]]." Do you remember that name?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, the Abyss Order's evil plan! We learned about that back in Mondstadt.
:{{DIcon}} You've got a new lead?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 12.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Not new. Not exactly... My memories suffer from erosion, but while I was recovering my health recently, I suddenly remembered something...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 13a.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 13b.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}}... {{MC|m=she|f=he}} mentioned the "Loom of Fate" back when we traveled together.
:{{DIcon}} All the way back then?
:{{DIcon}} So that was already a thing several centuries ago?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 14.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Apparently so. I was also quite surprised when these memories tallied up. I recall that we were traveling to Sumeru when the matter was brought up.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 14a.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 14b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you're going to the place that {{MC|m=she|f=he}} mentioned back then?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 15.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Correct. At that time, they must have been introduced, in one way or another, to this concept. If I recall correctly, we were somewhere in [[Avidya Forest]] then...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Maybe we'll discover some secret that's lain hidden for hundreds of years!
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 16.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' No. Now is not the time.
:{{DIcon}} Are you concerned about the Abyss Order?
:{{DIcon}} Are we waiting for the perfect moment?
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 17.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' No, it's just...
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 dainslaif 18.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I'm still waiting for my drink.
:{{A|vo szaq201 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously...?
:{{Black Screen|After Dain finishes his drink, you prepare to travel to [[Avidya Forest]]...}}
;(Talk to Kaeya next to [[Rama]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog szaq201 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oho? What a coincidence, I just finished my talks with the Sumeru merchant. Didn't expect to bump into you again.
:{{A|vo dialog szaq201 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Shall we head back to the tavern for a drink? I'd like to chat with you about what happened during last year's [[Windblume Festival]]. Now that was really...
:{{A|vo dialog szaq201 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...Ah, I see you have other things to do with your time. Busy as ever, hmm? Alright then, remember to come see me at the [[Angel's Share]] when next you're in Mondstadt. Safe travels.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Wait... This place, it's... familiar.
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about it? It looks pretty normal to Paimon... Was it like this hundreds of years ago, too?
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Yes. The forest has barely changed from how I remember it. There is very little human activity here, after all.
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Let's search the area and see what we can find.
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this a field? It must belong to whoever owns that house over there...
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But it looks like it's been abandoned for a long time. You could be forgiven for thinking nothing was ever grown here... Or wait, maybe nothing ever WAS grown here.
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's an extinguished bonfire. [[Forest Rangers]], perhaps?
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like it's been ages since it was last lit. And clearly they put it out carefully to prevent a forest fire, too. That's responsible.
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Nothing else stands out in this area. All that's left is that building. Come on.
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, we're just gonna go barging in? What if someone's home?
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 dainslaif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Unlikely. There are no signs of life in this area. We should be able to enter without incident.
:{{A|vo szaq201 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you say so... Well, uh... you lead the way then, Dain. Hehe...

;(Enter the house)
:{{A|vo szaq201 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so there really isn't anyone home... *cough* Ugh, this place is so dusty! Paimon bets no one's lived here in years!
:{{A|vo szaq201 7 dainslaif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Investigate carefully. We mustn't miss a single detail.

;(Investigate the bed)
:{{A|vo szaq201 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This bed looks pretty ordinary. Huh, there's nothing underneath it, either.
:{{A|vo szaq201 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What sort of person would wanna live here? It's so dark and damp... Can't be all that comfortable...

;(Investigate the box)
:{{A|vo szaq201 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a box over here. Why don't we open it? Uh, and by "we," Paimon means you... Paimon's just scared that... whatever's inside might bite her fingertips off...
:{{DIcon}} What in the world is going through your head...
:{{DIcon}} You sure are going places with your paranoia...
:{{A|vo szaq201 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? This is... a mirror.
:{{A|vo szaq201 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's broken, too. Was this a makeup box?
:{{DIcon}} It's just a regular mirror.
:{{DIcon}} It's just broken.
:{{A|vo szaq201 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm. That's kinda... disappointing. Paimon was hoping we'd uncover some super big secret, especially after Dain talked this place up.

;(Investigate the bowl)
:{{A|vo szaq201 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey look, it's a bowl. Guess whoever used to live here liked to cook, huh?
:{{A|vo szaq201 8 dainslaif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Can't you smell it? There's a heavy scent of medicinal herbs in here.
:{{A|vo szaq201 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, so it's a medicine bowl? ...*sniff* Hmm, seems you're right! You've got a good nose on you, Dain!

;(After investigating the three objects)
:{{A|vo szaq201 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Doesn't look like there's anything else worth our attention here. You sure we're in the right place, Dain?
:{{A|vo szaq201 11 dainslaif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' My memories are quite foggy, but my subconscious and instincts both assert that something once happened here.
:{{A|vo szaq201 11 dainslaif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' But, we'll exhaust ourselves if we search aimlessly... I hear noises outside. Let's go and check.
:{{A|vo szaq201 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Noises? Is it...
:{{A|vo szaq201 11 dainslaif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' It's not much. Just some minor adversaries.

;(Approach the enemies)
:{{A|vo szaq201 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Monsters! Wow, Dain's ears are sharp, just like his nose. He's in surprisingly good shape for a 500-year-old...
:{{A|vo szaq201 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, although for someone who's as full of surprises as Dain, it's hardly a big deal... Anyway, let's beat up these monsters!

;(After defeating the Slimes)
:{{A|vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I doubt that the appearance of those monsters was wholly random. There must be something nearby that attracted them.
:{{A|vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' A [[Ley Line]] anomaly, perhaps?&nbsp;...Hmm, but it seems to be more than that.
:{{A|vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Okay &mdash; I'll go slightly further out to investigate any issues with the nearby Ley Lines. I might be a while. You should wait for me here.
:{{A|vo szaq201 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You're going alone? You'd better not be trying to keep some secret from us!
:{{A|vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...Your suspicions are as banal as they are unwarranted. I merely think that this house should remain the focus of our investigation, and as such, someone ought to stay here and keep an eye on it.
:{{A|vo szaq201 13 dainslaif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Not to mention that if even Forest Rangers are capable of investigating Ley Lines, I will be more than able to handle it alone.
:{{A|vo szaq201 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, fair enough. Guess we'll just camp out here, then?
:{{A|vo szaq201 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good thing there's a bonfire over there. Let's make ourselves something to eat! All this running around has made Paimon real hungry.

;(Light the bonfire and approach it)
:{{Black Screen|You and Paimon make a fire, and before you know it, night sets in.}}
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, your cooking is as good as ever! Even if there was no other reason, the food alone would be enough for Paimon to stick with you, hee-hee!
:{{DIcon}} Well, freeloading comes more naturally to you than most...
:{{DIcon}} You're easy to please.
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Changing the subject, Dain's taking forever! He said that there might be an issue with the nearby Ley Lines... How bad do you think it could be?
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* We came together, but now it's back to just being the two of us again... Y'know, now that Paimon mentions it, we really have spent lots and lots of time together, haven't we?
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, so... don't take this the wrong way or anything, but, uh... d&mdash;do you ever get tired of Paimon being around?
:{{DIcon}} You make my day every day, Paimon.
::{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Aww, oh you, stop it! Now you're embarrassing Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Not really. You're better than nothing, I guess.
::{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, okay, fine. Paimon shoulda known you weren't gonna say anything nice.
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 06b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... So, um, next question... Don't know if it's okay to ask this, but Paimon's curious: What was it like traveling with your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}}?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ...
;(The Traveler looks up)
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The stars?
:{{DIcon}} We'd gaze at the stars, just like this.
:{{DIcon}} And we'd point at the planets we wanted to visit.
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow...
:{{DIcon}} We traveled through the universe, always by each other's side...
::{{DIcon}} This is the first time we've ever been separated.
::{{DIcon}} If nothing else... I just want to know what happened.
:{{DIcon}} We saw all manner of hope and despair.
::{{DIcon}} This is the first time we've ever been separated.
::{{DIcon}} If nothing else... I just want to know what happened.
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Paimon understands. Being separated without even knowing the reason why... it's just terrible.
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But we'll find the truth together, sure as Paimon's your guide! Just you wait, [[Heavenly Principles]]! And you too, [[Teyvat]]!
:{{DIcon}} Just you wait, Heavenly Principles!
:{{DIcon}} And you too, Teyvat!
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Y'know what? We've talked too long about this sad stuff. Let's talk about something happy instead! 'Cause if you're sad... Paimon will be too.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry about it, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Paimon.
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, alright. It's getting dark, so why don't you rest? Paimon will take first watch. Don't worry, no monster's gonna come and eat you up!
:{{DIcon}} Well, that's a first. Paimon, not going to bed before me?
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, come on, don't say that... Paimon just wants to look after you for once.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:{{DIcon}} Goodnight then, Paimon.
:{{A|vo szaq201 14 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nighty-night! Go on, shoo, off to sleep!
:{{Black Screen|Memories of your sibling fill your mind as you fall soundly asleep...}}
:;(The Traveler opens their eyes and sees Dainsleif in blurry vision)
:{{A|vo szaq202 1 dainslaif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Hey, time to wake up. The sun has risen.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...Dain?)
:{{A|vo szaq202 1 dainslaif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' What a deep sleeper. You do know that we need to...
:{{A|vo szaq202 1 dainslaif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Hmm? Tear stains... You dreamed of your sibling last night, didn't you?
:{{A|vo szaq202 1 dainslaif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...Alright. Rest here a bit longer then. I'll head into the forest to investigate.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Huh? Why're you going back into the forest...)
:;(The Traveler falls back asleep)
:{{A|vo szaq202 1 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq202 1 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' *yawn*...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Hmm? How did I sleep till morning? Why didn't Paimon wake me up to switch shifts? ...&nbsp;Hang on a moment... Where IS Paimon, anyway?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Ah, I vaguely remember Dain coming over. Did Paimon go into the woods with him, seeing how I hadn't woken up yet?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Whatever the case, looks like it's just me here for now. Guess it's time to stretch my limbs and have a look around.)
:<!-- missing VO -->'''???:''' (Clatter...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Wait, did that noise come from... inside the house?)
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, is that you?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, this isn't the time for hide-and-seek...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (No reply... I should go inside and check.)

==Trivia==
* Based on [[Mail/New Drinks... (2023-04-30)|Diluc's 2023 birthday mail]], which arrived about two months after this quest was released, Kaeya's spice deal ultimately went through, and Dawn Winery received spices with which to make new drinks.
** Although birthday mails are the same for all players regardless of quest progression, several birthday mails are unambiguously set after certain quests. Of particular note is [[Mail/Oho! Let Me Take a Wild Guess... (2023-04-07)|Dehya's 2023 birthday mail]], which contains a reference to the end of [[Chapter III]] ([[Setaria]]'s activities) that cannot be explained as a natural consequence of needing to become acquainted with Dehya.<!-- compare Wanderer's and Raiden Shogun's 2023 and 2022 birthday mails, which also unambiguously take place after certain quests but can be argued as a necessity for getting on send-birthday-mail terms in the first place --> This makes it possible that Diluc's 2023 birthday mail is set after the events of this quest.
