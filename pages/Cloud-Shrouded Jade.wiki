|description     = This sweet and sticky snack will somehow not affect your throat in any negative way, which is why it's Yun Jin's favorite. The aftertaste is most elegant, not something one would get sick of quickly. Come to think of it... This is quite a decent bit more than she would usually make for herself - but who are you to question her kindness?

==Trivia==
*The following birthday mails included Cloud-Shrouded Jade:
**[[Birthday/Yun Jin#Would You Like a Midnight Snack?|Yun Jin's 2022 Birthday Mail]] (1 Cloud-Shrouded Jade)
*The round, ball part of this dish is based on the real-life dish {{w|Tangyuan_(food)|tangyuan}} {{Lang|zh=汤圆|zh_rm=tāngyuán}}, a glutinous rice dessert traditionally served in water and consumed at the {{w|Lantern Festival}}, as well as weddings, family reunions, and the {{w|Dongzhi Festival|Winter Solstice Festival}}. This whole dish, however, seems to be lotus paste stuffed tangyuan served on egg custard, compared to the original dish.
*The Chinese name of this dish is a reference to a term in {{w|Beijing Opera}}, [https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%BA%91%E9%81%AE%E6%9C%88/6099911 "Cloud-cover-the-moon voice"] {{Lang|zh=云遮月|zh_rm=Yún Zhē Yùe}}, describing a beautiful, mellow and reserved voice.
