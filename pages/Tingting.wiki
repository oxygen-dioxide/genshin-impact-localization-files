==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[Radiant Sakura]])
:'''Tingting:''' Hmm... Even if I've met him, I still have to...
:{{DIcon}} Something on your mind?
::'''Tingting:''' Ah, well, I'm a researcher from [[Liyue]]. My dream is to travel around the world and visit all seven nations.
::'''Tingting:''' My journey has been pretty smooth so far in [[Mondstadt]], [[Sumeru]], [[Natlan]], and [[Fontaine]]. But things developed unexpectedly here in Inazuma.
::'''Tingting:''' Because of the [[Sakoku Decree]], I could not enter [[Inazuma City]]. When I was about to leave out of disappointment, I ran into him...
::{{DIcon}} "Him"?
::'''Tingting:''' Yeah, he was the first person I met in Inazuma who was willing to help me.
::'''Tingting:''' Because he saw that I was a lone outlander, he offered a lot of help to me while I was stuck in Ritou.
::'''Tingting:''' Honestly, he's very kind and warm. I've become quite fond of him...
::'''Tingting:''' But my worldwide sojourn has not ended yet. I can't just settle in Inazuma.
::'''Tingting:''' Love is precious, but liberty is more so still... I really need to choose carefully.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Freedom...
:::'''Tingting:''' Yeah, if you don't have a desire for freedom, then no matter how long you've been journeying for, you still won't be able to see things with an open mind.
:::'''Tingting:''' From the looks of things, you are also a Traveler, right? These are for you.
:::'''Tingting:''' After you go to more places, I think you'll be able to understand the value of freedom more.
::;(Obtain [[Guide to Freedom]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tingting:''' Goodbye. Safe travels.

;(After completing [[Radiant Sakura]])
:'''Tingting:''' Oh... What if he insists on staying?
:{{DIcon}} Is something troubling you?
::'''Tingting:''' Ah, well, I'm a researcher from [[Liyue]]. My dream is to travel around the world and visit all seven nations.
::'''Tingting:''' My journey has been pretty smooth so far in [[Mondstadt]], [[Sumeru]], [[Natlan]], and [[Fontaine]]. But things developed unexpectedly here in Inazuma due to the [[Sakoku Decree]], and I was unable to leave [[Ritou]].
::'''Tingting:''' Now, I can finally explore the islands here.
::'''Tingting:''' But my journey here will end someday, and at that time, I might just have no choice but to leave him...
::{{DIcon}} "Him"?
:::;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::;(Same as before)
