==Description==
The favored barbed spear of a [[Ako Domeki|famous Inazuman bandit]].<br />
It was originally a harpoon used to catch fish, but it was also very handy in battle.<br />
They say that he even pierced the [[Maguu Kenki|enchanted, sword-armed puppet]] before carrying it off.

"Haha! Once, I was the master of this ship, the '[["Seiraimaru"|Seiraimaru]].'"<br />
"I commanded over ten ships, and they called me the Deathless Oni of Seirai."<br />
"Now, I am but a leaf floating upon the waves."<br />
"If not for [[Janome]] and the people marooned on [[Golden Apple Archipelago|those islands]],"<br />
"Forget raising our sails again &mdash; I doubt I would have managed to make it back to my home shores."<br />
"And yet Seirai now looks like this."<br />
"There is no longer any place for me in the Inazuman Islands."<br />
"Even that [[Asase Hibiki|naggy, fretful old shrine maiden]] is gone..."

The bandit named [[Ako Domeki]]'s voice was thick with emotion. Then he said...<br />
"Hey, Janome! I'm now the freest man in the whole wide world!"<br />
"Aunt Shrine Maiden! Didn't you say that you wanted to go see the world?"<br />
"You know, go someplace else, like that [[Kamuna Harunosuke|Kamuna]] guy or that [[Takamine the Mistsplitter|Konbumaru]] you always talk about?"<br />
"You know what? Let me, Ako Domeki Zaemon, go in your stead!"<br />
"Let me go see what the edge of the world really looks like!"

"We'll meet again where all ship routes end!"<ref group="Note">This is another way of referring to death or the afterlife.</ref><br />
"And when we do, it'll be my turn to tell you all about these distant lands!"

==Lore==
"The Catch" was originally wielded by [[Ako Domeki]].
