==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|After resolving the Wingless's problem, you rush back to the trial site...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Inkanak)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 1 inkanak 01.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Oh, hey there, Chasca. Did Elder Allpa send you?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 1 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yeah, she's got other things on her plate right now. How are things looking here?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 1 inkanak 02.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Hmm, well, the inspection revealed numerous blockages all over the trial arena. It looks like they're the result of [[Ley Line Disorder|ley line disorders]] caused by repeat [[Abyss]] invasions.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 1 inkanak 03.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Theoretically, we just need to clear those obstacles, and the arena will fill up with [[Gaseous Phlogiston|gaseous phlogiston]] again. But that's proving difficult to achieve in practice, for all sorts of reasons...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 1 inkanak 04.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Why don't you head on down and check things out for yourself? Feel free to ask the staff for more details.

;(Talk to Inkanak again, optional)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 1 inkanak 04.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Why don't you head on down and check things out for yourself? Feel free to ask the staff for more details.

;(Talk to the [[Doubtful Investigator]] or [[Confused Investigator]], optional)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 5 perplexedinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Doubtful Investigator:''' How strange... why is there so much [[phlogiston|solid phlogiston]] here?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 5 confusedinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Confused Investigator:''' Could be from the [[Children of Echoes]]...? Maybe it got swept up here due to the Ley Line disturbances. {{Color|buzzword|And I did see those strange markings on the cliff...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq002 5 perplexedinvestigator 02.ogg}} '''Doubtful Investigator:''' Ugh, I can't think of a way to resolve this... Short of going all the way to the Children of Echoes to borrow a {{Color|buzzword|tepetlisaur}}...

;(Talk to the Doubtful Investigator or Confused Investigator after clearing the spout, optional)<!-- Same dialogue if tepetlisaur is not used -->
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 perplexedinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Doubtful Investigator:''' Whoa! Did you see that!? A [[tepetlisaur]] just showed up out of nowhere!
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 confusedinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Confused Investigator:''' How did it get here? Just passing by, or...? Huh. Well, not gonna argue with a good thing. The spout's clear, that's all that matters...

;(Approach the [[Bold Investigator]])
:{{A|vo qsklq002 7 boldinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' Oh, are you here to help? Thank goodness! There's no way I could do this all by myself...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 7 boldinvestigator 02.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' The blockage here has to be cleared using a special bomb, but carrying explosives up that steep slope would be a recipe for disaster...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 7 boldinvestigator 03.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' If I dropped it, or slipped and fell, I'd be blown to bits in an instant. So my plan was to transport the bomb to the other side, then send it over in a hot air balloon...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 7 boldinvestigator 04.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' All I need now is for someone else to {{Color|buzzword|strike the balloon at the right moment, dropping the payload right on top of the spout...}} and problem solved!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 7 boldinvestigator 05.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' What do you think? Simple enough, right?
:{{DIcon}} I think I can handle that.
::{{DIcon}} Is that hot air balloon up there yours, too?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 7 boldinvestigator 06.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' Huh? Oh, THAT one... No, I've got no idea who that belongs to. Or how they got it up so high...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 7 boldinvestigator 07.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' I just wish I could fly up there and check out what kind of tech they're using... Ah well, getting the trial arena back in order is more important.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 7 boldinvestigator 08.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' I'll head over and set up now. Let me know when you're ready!

;(Talk to the Bold Investigator again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 boldinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' Huh? Why'd you guys follow me? You won't get a good enough view from here.
:{{DIcon}} Could you go over the plan with me again?
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 boldinvestigator 02.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' Oh, sure. So, I'm gonna send the explosives over to the spout on the other side in a hot air balloon...
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 boldinvestigator 03.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' All you have to do is {{Color|buzzword|hit the balloon at the right moment, so the bomb falls right on top of the spout.}} Simple!

;(Call the balloon)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 boldinvestigator 04.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' Alright! Get ready...

;(If the player immediately destroys the balloon, optional)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 10 boldinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' Whoa! Careful! You almost blew me up!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 10 boldinvestigator 02.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' Let's try that again... Geez... That better not have been on purpose...

;(Talk to the Bold Investigator after exploding the rock, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 boldinvestigator 05.ogg}} '''Bold Investigator:''' From this angle, you can see more clearly just how high up that hot air balloon is... I wish I knew whose it was.

;(Talk to the [[Curious Investigator]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 curiousinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Curious Investigator:''' This is crazy... I put all of my strength into it, but it just won't break...
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 curiousinvestigator 02.ogg}} '''Curious Investigator:''' Maybe Inkanak was right after all... If a stable structure has formed inside the solid phlogiston, I'll need to hit all the weak spots at the same time to break it...
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 curiousinvestigator 03.ogg}} '''Curious Investigator:''' ...But how am I supposed to do that?

;(Talk to the Curious Investigator after destroying the solid phlogiston, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 curiousinvestigator 04.ogg}} '''Curious Investigator:''' Ahh, so THAT'S how you do it... Amazing!

;(Talk to the Cautious Investigator, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 cautiousinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Cautious Investigator:''' Hmm... I think it should be possible to clear this spout {{Color|buzzword|with just a few hard hits}}.
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 cautiousinvestigator 02.ogg}} '''Cautious Investigator:''' But there are signs of strange life in here... Meddling with it might be dangerous...

;(Destroy the rock)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 3 cautiousinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Cautious Investigator:''' Aaah! Monsters!

;(After defeating the monster)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 4 cautiousinvestigator 01.ogg}} '''Cautious Investigator:''' Haha... I thought I was done for! This spout should be good now &mdash; thank you very much.

;(Talk to the Cautious Investigator again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 cautiousinvestigator 03.ogg}} '''Cautious Investigator:''' Haha... I thought I was done for! This spout should be good now &mdash; thank you very much.
----
;(After clearing all of the blockages)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 14 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The gaseous phlogiston is being replenished... Looks like all the spouts have been unblocked. Let's head back up.

;(Approach Inkanak)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 15 inkanak 01.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Wow, you took care of everything in no time at all... Incredible work!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 15 inkanak 02.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Now, we just have to wait until the gaseous phlogiston is fully replenished. Then we can kick off the retrials.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 15 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hmm... Actually, Inkanak, I'd like to do a test flight first, just to make sure we're not missing anything. Could you arrange that for me?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 15 inkanak 03.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Huh? But... you only just finished getting the arena ready, there could still be other hazards we're unaware of...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 15 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' All the more reason to have me test it out. Think of it as another inspection.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 15 inkanak 04.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Eh... I guess you're right &mdash; with your flying skills, you won't be in any serious danger, even if there are hazards we overlooked...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 15 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The conditions in this area seem a little unstable, but a test-flight is the only way to catch any lingering issues.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 15 inkanak 05.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Alright, I'll get things set up for you. Just let me know when you're ready.

;(Talk to Inkanak again)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 16 inkanak 01.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Are you ready? This should be a piece of cake for Chasca, but still, try to be careful.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure she'll be fine!
::{{A|vo qsklq002 16 inkanak 02a 1.ogg}} '''Inkanak:''' Alright, then spread your wings and fly!
:{{DIcon}} Not yet, I need a little more time.

;(After completing the trial successfully) <!-- No additional dialogue if player fails -->
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was amazing! Paimon couldn't take her eyes off you!
:{{DIcon}} So, any further issues with the venue?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hmm... No, nothing major. Give it a few days, and we should be able to conduct the trials.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 isidore 01.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Help... Help me!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 isidore 02.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' ...You're from the [[Flower-Feather Clan]], right? Please, come quick, you've got to help us!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Catch your breath first. What's the situation?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 isidore 03.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' W&mdash;We were... We got attacked, by a [[qucusaur]]!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 isidore 04.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' My friends are still stranded in the middle of the road with the goods we were transporting... Please, I'm begging you, save them!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Are qucusaurs really that aggressive? Do they usually attack groups of people unprovoked?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 17 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Not in my experience... but there are exceptions to every rule. Let's go check it out.

;(Approach the merchants)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 youngmerchants 01.ogg}} '''Young Merchant:''' Ouch...
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq002 elderlymerchants 01.ogg}} '''Elderly Merchant:''' I've never seen such an aggressive qucusaur...

;(Talk to the merchants, optional)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 18 youngmerchants 01.ogg}} '''Young Merchant:''' Ouch...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 18 elderlymerchants 01.ogg}} '''Elderly Merchant:''' I've never seen such an aggressive qucusaur...

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Hm? Chasca, {{Traveler}}? This is a surprise.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Elder Allpa? Huh? So... where's this aggressive qucusaur we've heard about?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 allpa 02.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Already flew away. Looks like it backed off once it realized that reinforcements were coming.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' So why do you think it attacked these people in the first place? Was it after the food?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 allpa 03.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' No, these merchants aren't even transporting food...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 youngmerchants 01.ogg}} '''Young Merchant:''' Ah! Thank goodness! The Phlogiston Wings are intact!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Phlogiston Wings?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 isidore 01.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Ahh, thank you so much for coming to our rescue. These Phlogiston Wings are our most prized goods. If anything happened to them, it would ruin us...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 allpa 04.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...Wait a minute, are you the merchants that were looking to collaborate with us? [[Warmi]] told me about you.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 isidore 02.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Yeah, that's us! So... I take it you're Elder Allpa?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 allpa 05.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' I am. You must be exhausted from your journey, not to mention shaken up from the attack. Let me bring you back to our tribe to rest &mdash; we can talk business after you've recovered.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' But Elder Allpa, what about the qucusaur attack?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 allpa 06.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Well, our guests here weren't seriously injured, and their goods are intact... Perhaps that qucusaur was just having a bad day.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 allpa 07.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' There are so many of them around here, you'd expect something like this every once in a while. I don't think we need to pursue it any further... More importantly, how are the preparations for the flying trials going? Is everything in order over at the arena?
:{{DIcon}} Everything's on track.
:{{DIcon}} The trials will be able to start very soon.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 isidore 03.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Huh? Did you say... flying trials? Wow, what a coincidence! Sounds like a perfect use case for our Phlogiston Wings! You'll be pleasantly surprised by what they can do!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 allpa 08.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Oh, really? ...Now I'm intrigued.
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 isidore 04.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Hehe, well then let's forget all about this qucusaur attack for now... We have some serious business to discuss!
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's it? That all went smoother than expected... Well, guess we'd better get going... Huh? Chasca?
:{{DIcon}} What are you looking at?
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...
:[[File:The Night Before the Trial Feather.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo qsklq002 19 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' A bloodstained feather...
:{{Black Screen|The incident is forgotten about, and peace returns to the Flower-Feather Clan.<br>The next few days are uneventful &mdash; except for the flying trial preparations, which continue at an accelerated pace...}}
