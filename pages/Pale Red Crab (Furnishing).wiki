|description    = A claw-snapping crab that can be found in various water bodies throughout Teyvat.<br>It has a light red colored shell and a gentle nature. As such, it's a lot more suitable to be raised for ornamental display than others of its kind.<br>It is said that after arriving in the Serenitea Pot, such crabs and the [[Unagi]] have since become neighbors.
