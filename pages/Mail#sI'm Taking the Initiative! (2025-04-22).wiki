Even just writing this makes me feel like... I've taken a big step forward!

This was a very special year for me. Not only because I got to join the [[Night Warden Wars]], but also because I got to meet you! I want to work hard to become a capable and dependable friend like you!

And my first step... is to invite friends to my birthday party! [[Mualani]] would always secretly organize such parties for me, but this year, I want to be brave enough to try! I've even prepared what I want to say to everyone, to thank them for helping me all this time...

Umm... But before the party starts, could you be my speech coach and listen to me read my thank-you letter? Just thinking of talking in front of everyone makes my tail all twitchy...

If you don't mind, you can even have a shiny gem from my backpack! Pick any you like!
