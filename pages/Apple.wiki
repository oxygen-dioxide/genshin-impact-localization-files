'''Apples''' are a [[food]] item that can be obtained by foraging in the wild.

Apple restores 300 HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]]; this can only target characters of the player's party.

==How to Obtain==
Apples grow in groups of three on some [[Cuihua Wood|Cuihua Trees]] in [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]], and can be harvested by either climbing or hitting the tree to make them fall within the player's reach. Dropped Apples may also be found at the base of such trees and in critter hideouts. They are most commonly found in [[Windwail Highland]] and [[Starfell Valley]].

Apples can also be dropped by destructible crates, barrels and pots or by [[Investigation]] points found all over [[Teyvat]].

See the Video Guides section or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=165 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Apples after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
*[[Farrah]] in [[Springvale]], [[Mondstadt]] (5 Apples)
