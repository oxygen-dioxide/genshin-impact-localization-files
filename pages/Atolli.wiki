==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Atolli:''' A legendary new dish! ... Hmm, is that a little overblown?
:{{DIcon}} Legendary dish?
::'''Atolli:''' Haha, so you overheard me just now? My apologies, I was merely wondering how best to promote my new dish. After all, the Epic Feast Showdown is about to begin!
::'''Atolli:''' Calling it "legendary" might be going a little too far, but I'm not sure what else I can say...
::{{DIcon}} About the Epic Feast Showdown...
::'''Atolli:''' Ah, it's basically an eating contest &mdash; everyone eats as much as they can, and the one who eats the most wins!
::'''Atolli:''' It brings more people through the door and presents a great opportunity to introduce new dishes while they're here...
::'''Atolli:''' But all that's just a bonus. The most important thing is that everyone can eat and be happy! That's the dream of every chef!
:{{DIcon}}See you.
::'''Atolli:''' Bye. Drop by again if you find yourself feeling hungry!
