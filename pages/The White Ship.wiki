==Trivia==
*The achievement's name is a reference to the 1919 H. P. Lovecraft short story {{W|The White Ship (story)|of the same name}}, which concerns an ethereal supernatural ship out-of-phase with normal reality. [[Ahes]]' affinity for the sea, fascination with the [[Sponsian]] and eagerness to follow it mirror the story's narrator (whom its captain was likewise [[Basil Elton|named after]]). Also like in the story, the quest ends with the protagonist experiencing the ship's destruction, being snapped back to reality, and finding evidence of the wreckage.
*Whilst not a direct quote from the story, the achievement's description is likely still a reference to it. As ''The White Ship'' was part of Lovecraft's metaphysical {{W|Dream Cycle}} series of writings, hence the titular vessel's mystical properties.
