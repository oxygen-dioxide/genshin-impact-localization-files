|description    = An exquisite racket made from [[Maple Wood]]. It originally had a symbolic meaning of "warding off evil spirits," but is now better known as a kind of accessory. If you find a partner and a special ball, you can use them to play a ball game that is local to [[Inazuma]]. According to tradition, the winner can paint on the face of the loser with a brush. That is why you can always see a few children with ink on their faces at festivals.
