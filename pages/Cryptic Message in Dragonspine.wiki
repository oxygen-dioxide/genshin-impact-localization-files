'''Cryptic Message in Dragonspine''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Dragonspine]], [[Mondstadt]]. It involves finding the nine Record of Serial No. to unveil one last message.

See the [[#Lore|lore section]] for the message and how it was obtained.

Interact with the nine buried ruin guards in the following locations, in any order:
# Record of Serial No. HU-16180 and Record of Serial No. GN/Hu-68513
#* On the South Eastern jutting out landmass.

===Deciphering===
#The messages are ordered by the serial number of the Ruin Guards in ascending order.
#*This is based on the observation that the first digit of all the serial numbers are unique, and can be ordered from 1 to 9.
#Dashes (-) separate the code into three-character strings.
#*For example, the first three-character string would be "3.2".
#".", "2", and "3" are converted into "0", "1", and "2" respectively, based on the ternary (base 3) numeral system.
#*This is based on the observation that the highest three-digit number in ternary (222) is 26 in decimal, which is the number of letters in the English alphabet.
#*For example, "3.2" becomes "201".
#Those ternary numbers are converted into decimal.
#*For example, converting the ternary number 201 into decimal, we get 2×3<sup>2</sup> + 0×3<sup>1</sup> + 1×3<sup>0</sup> = 19.
#These decimal numbers are converted into letters, where A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on.
#*For example, the decimal number 19 becomes "S".
#The resulting message is further decoded by applying the ROT13 cipher: replacing each letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
#*For example, the letter "S" becomes "F".

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing this Hidden Exploration Objective awards the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[Futile Endeavor]]''.
* Though it might have been thought that the records somehow relate to the fall of [[Sal Vindagnyr]] and have some connection to [[Celestia]] and the [[Skyfrost Nail]], Ruin Guards are in fact an invention of [[Khaenri'ah]], so the record may instead refer to the fall of that civilization and have nothing to do with Dragonspine at all.
