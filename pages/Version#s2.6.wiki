;Spiral Abyss
* Floor 11 Ley Line Disorders changed to:
** All characters in the party gain a 75% Anemo DMG Bonus.
* Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.6, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:
** Phase I: Sheet-Ice Moon
*** After a character's Normal Attack hits an opponent, this opponent will be afflicted with a Mark of Ending. After 10s, this Mark of Ending will be removed, dealing True DMG to this opponent. When a character's Normal Attack hits an opponent with a Mark of Ending, the DMG dealt by the Mark of Ending's removal will be increased. This DMG can be increased 9 times.
** Phase II: Snap-Rain Moon
*** After a character's Normal Attacks hit opponents, the DMG dealt by this character's Normal Attacks will increase by 12% for 5s. This effect can stack up to 5 times. Each stack is calculated independently. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s.
** Phase III: Iris Moon
*** After a character's Normal Attack deals DMG to an opponent, the Physical/Elemental RES of this opponent will decrease by 6% for 5s, matching the type of DMG dealt. This can stack up to 7 times. RES decreases of different types can co-exist, and their stacks and timers will be independent of each other.

==Known Issues==
# After updating the official driver released by Razer on January 20, some Travelers using Razer devices on PC may experience a crash error when logging in to the game. Travelers who encounter this problem can try to uninstall the Razer driver first and restart the computer as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, please contact us via the email Genshin_cs@hoyoverse.com.
# When using an iOS or Android device to play the game, after some characters cast their Elemental Bursts, there may be a problem with their weapons' color display. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
# Under certain circumstances, there is a probability that the background music of some areas cannot be played when playing on iOS devices. This issue will be fixed in the update on 03/31/2022. Travelers can also resolve this issue by uninstalling the game and re-downloading and installing it, before this issue is fixed.
# Continuous attacks have a very low probability of abnormally and significantly extending the duration of various effects on the character [[Kamisato Ayato]] (up to twice the duration), including but not limited to the "Takimeguri Kanka" state from his Elemental Skill, "Corrosion", and "Smoldering Flames" that are applied to the character.<br />The developers have detected the initial cause of this issue. As the fix involves fundamental logic, this issue will be fixed in Version 3.0 after comprehensive testing.<br />*Note: The fix will not affect the abnormal increase in duration caused by hit lag, or Plunging Attacks that can be performed from jumping on a flat surface due to hit lag.
# There is an issue in the current version whereby the [[Electro-Charged]] reaction mechanism is abnormal. This is a new issue that surfaced after the [[Version 2.4]] update.<br />The development team has detected the cause of this issue and it will be fixed in the [[Version 2.7]] update.<br />After the issue is fixed, the Electro-Charged reaction mechanism is expected to function as it did before the Version 2.4 update.
