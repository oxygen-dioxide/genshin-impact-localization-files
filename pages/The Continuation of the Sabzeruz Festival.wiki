==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You come to attend today's [[Sabzeruz Festival]], but you are haunted by a lingering sense of déjà vu...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(The Traveler blinks awake, with some blinks revealing a black and white ceiling)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn* Why does Paimon feel so tired after so much sleep?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, we should go meet Dunyarzad right away.
;(Paimon leaves while the Traveler stretches)

;(Approach Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good morning, Dunyarzad! Sorry to keep you waiting.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 2 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Not at all. I arrived early.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon thinks you sound kinda tired... Did you not get enough sleep?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 2 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I'm doing well. There's no need to worry. Shall we go? Let's start with the stalls over there.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great idea! Let's get going. Traveler... Uh, hey, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} This feels... all too familiar.
:{{DIcon}} What a strong sense of déjà vu...
;(A scene transition occurs)
:{{color|menu|Everything is so familiar that you feel at a loss...}}
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 01.ogg}} '''[[Vihar]]:''' Haha, it's all thanks to Miss Dunyarzad's sponsorship that the children can enjoy the Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 02.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Oh, are you interested in Yalda Candies? I have some boxes of candy here. Pick whichever one you want.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, not much of a choice... All these boxes look the same.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 03.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Haha, it's not that simple. Each box contains a random flavor &mdash; it's up to the luck of the draw. Flavors include [[Lavender Melon]], [[Harra Fruit]], [[Sunsettia]]...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hm-hmm~ They all sound pretty tasty.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 04.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' ...And there's also [[Lizard Tail]] and [[Onikabuto]].
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? What were those last two!?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... {{MC|He|She|mc=1}}'ll help me choose. Paimon wants the Sunsettia flavor!
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 05.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' No problem. These boxes of candy are numbered one to five from left to right. Which one do you want?
:{{DIcon}} Number four.
:{{DIcon}} Number four.
:{{DIcon}} Number four.
:{{DIcon}} Number four.
:{{DIcon}} Number four.
:{{color|menu|You point at number four.}}
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 06.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Oho? I like your confidence &mdash; no hesitation at all. Ah, congratulations! Number four is indeed Sunsettia.
;(A short flashback occurs)
:;(The Traveler points at a box)
:;(The remaining child is shown with their hands over their eyes)<!-- this signifies that the Traveler has indeed chosen the wrong box(es) before -->
:;(Multiple boxes are briefly focused on)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Haha, Paimon knew {{MC|he|she|mc=1}} always had incredible luck!
:{{DIcon}} Number one is Lizard Tail.
:{{DIcon}} Number two is Harra Fruit.
:{{DIcon}} Number three is Lavender Melon.
:{{DIcon}} Number five is Onikabuto.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm, Paimon's not really interested in the other flavors.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 07.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Ah... W&mdash;Wait, how did you know? Don't tell me that you already knew which flavor was in each box?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 07b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? {{MC|He|She|mc=1}} was right about all of them?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 08.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' That couldn't have been luck. H&mdash;How is this possible? I packed all those boxes this morning, and they've been sealed ever since. You couldn't have known beforehand.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 vihar 09.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' ...Mind reading? X-ray vision? Or some kind of magic trick? This is way too freaky...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tell us what's going on! Since when did you get superpowers... Traveler?
:{{color|menu|You seem to see a little girl...}}
:{{DIcon}} Just now, that was...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Where are you going?
:{{color|menu|She feels very familiar to you, so you decide to follow her.}}

;(After the dialogue)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's going on? Did you see something?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Us leaving Dunyarzad without letting her know is kinda rude, you know.

;(Talk to Amal, optional)<!-- same as previous quest -->
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq009 amal 01.ogg}} '''[[Amal]]:''' I picked all of these from the forest yesterday, so their freshness is guaranteed!

;(Talk to Kimiya, optional)<!-- same as previous quest -->
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq009 kimiya 01.ogg}} '''[[Kimiya]]:''' This is divine wisdom...

;(Talk to Vihar again, optional)<!-- same as previous quest -->
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq009 vihar 01.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Atten-tion! Any more requests, young soldiers?

;(After following the familiar figure to the northern residential area of Sumeru City)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you looking for? Why did we come here?
;(The Traveler looks around)
:{{Black Screen|A familiar figure... An overwhelming sense of déjà vu...}}
:{{A|vo xmaq010 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Traveler?
;(The screen flashes black and white, briefly showing the mysterious figure on the path behind the Traveler)
;(The Traveler immediately turns around and runs off)
:{{DIcon}} Over there.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's...
;(Paimon follows the Traveler)
;(Camera pans to show that the bird in a nearby closed birdcage is now missing)
:{{color|menu|You keep following the girl...}}
----
;(Approach the mysterious figure near the [[Bimarstan's Proverb Column]])
:'''[[Nahida|???]]:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
;(The screen flashes black and white)
;(Dunyarzad appears on a nearby bed)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look! That's... Isn't that Dunyarzad!?
:{{DIcon}} What!?
:{{DIcon}} She was still with us just a moment ago...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's happening here? Why are there two Dunyarzads?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 01.ogg}} '''???:''' You already know that this isn't your first Sabzeruz Festival, don't you?
:{{DIcon}} ???
:{{DIcon}} (Alert)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 02.ogg}} '''???:''' I'm sure you already know how to use this.
;(Nahida holds out a yellow Knowledge Capsule)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A Knowledge Capsule? Where did you get it...? What's inside?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 03.ogg}} '''???:''' You should use it too, Paimon.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... Y&mdash;You know Paimon?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Let's use it together, Paimon.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Well, this seems kinda sketchy, but... Paimon feels like this is what we should do.
:{{color|menu|After touching the Knowledge Capsule, countless memories resurface in your mind.}}

:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' W&mdash;What the!?
:{{DIcon}} Memories!
:{{DIcon}} So many days' worth of memories...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is our twentieth time at the Sabzeruz Festival? Hmm, no... The thirtieth? Fortieth? Just how many times have we been to the Sabzeruz Festival?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have we been trapped in a single day? If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have even realized...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the heck was inside that Knowledge Capsule?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 04.ogg}} '''???:''' Your memories are still scrambled? Try your best to remember. This isn't the first time we've met, and I answered that question a long time ago.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Let Paimon think... Ohh, it's coming back... Meeting you was the real catalyst for restoring our memories, and... the Knowledge Capsule was just your means of showing our minds the way...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about everyone else? Why are you only helping the two of us?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Your sense of déjà vu is stronger than everyone else's, yes? As for an explanation... You two received the blessing of [[Dendro]], and you also have special, sensitive constitutions.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 06.ogg}} '''???:''' It was as if a single sheet of paper was separating those memories from your consciousness.
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong with the Dunyarzad over there...?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 07.ogg}} '''???:''' A familiar question. I think this is the seventh time you asked that.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 08.ogg}} '''???:''' As you can see, she isn't doing well. You probably sensed it, too &mdash; the Dunyarzad you were just with is different from the first Dunyarzad you met.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 09.ogg}} '''???:''' That "first" Dunyarzad is in front of you right now, and... she doesn't have a lot of time left.
:{{DIcon}} What I need to do right now is...
:{{DIcon}} Break out of this cycle...?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 10.ogg}} '''???:''' Hehe, looks like you're almost done sorting out your brain.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Oh yeah, I'm Nahida.
:{{DIcon}} I know; you introduced yourself before.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Good, you passed the test.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's happening...? You can awaken our memories, and you seem like you know what's going on... Wait, please don't tell Paimon even you don't know!
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Everything in this world runs in a loop... This cycle is called a "samsara." You, me, and everyone else are all stuck inside a one-day samsara...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As for the truth... That's on you to find out. If you were told the truth instead of discovering it yourselves... It would literally blow your minds. I don't know how you'd be after that.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I can only give you surface-level help, like bits of information and subtle hints. For the rest of the time, I'll be doing all I can to slow down Dunyarzad's illness.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She looks like she isn't doing well at all... Her illness gets worse after each Sabzeruz Festival...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If we can break out of this samsara, I might be able to save her.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...But as things are right now, she's just a small bird in the sky that's about to lose its last feathers. All I can do is raise a gale to delay her fall.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure love to use weird analogies.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Analogies are wonderful tools. They let you use existing knowledge to understand unfamiliar things.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Okay, so... With what you know so far, what do you think the truth is?
:{{DIcon}} Hmm... Let me collect my thoughts...
----
;(The Traveler enters {{color|menu|Contemplation}})

;(Select - The Sabzeruz Festival Samasara)
:{{A|vo xmaq013 10 hero 06.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq013 10 heroine 06.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' We've already experienced the Sabzeruz Festival many times. And... the day of the festival seems to be in a perpetual samsara.
;(Select - The [[Azar|Grand Sage]]'s Speech)
:{{A|vo xmaq013 10 hero 03.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq013 10 heroine 03.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' The Grand Sage said, "Go celebrate the birth of that god to your heart's content." Did he mean something more?
;(Select - Alchemical Divination Results)
:{{A|vo xmaq013 10 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq013 10 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' The Moon, illusions, and lies... What do they all mean?
;(Select - Deja Vu)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 hero 02.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq010 10 heroine 02.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' What's happening right now seems to have happened before. This feeling has been getting stronger and stronger...
;(Select - Abnormal Mental Fatigue)
:{{A|vo xmaq013 10 hero 05.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq013 10 heroine 05.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' My mind feels exhausted, even though I haven't done too much thinking. What is going on?

;(Submitting the wrong conclusion)
:{{A|vo xmaq013 10 hero 23.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq013 10 heroine 23.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' That doesn't sound right... I need to carefully think things through...
;(Submitting the wrong association)
:{{A|vo xmaq013 10 hero 24.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq013 10 heroine 24.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' Hmm... I can't seem to cohesively piece everything together.

;(Submit the correct association - Sabzeruz Festival Samasara to Deja Vu)
;(Select - Time Loop)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 hero 17.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq010 10 heroine 17.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' That should be it... The flow of time is endlessly cycling within one single day.
----
:{{color|menu|After going over what happened in detail, you believe the only plausible explanation is "Time Loop."}}
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' A time loop... *sigh* You've given similarly wrong answers in the past. A pity.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still the wrong answer... Paimon thought that made a lot of sense! It feels like time's just repeating itself.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' A simple time loop can't explain some of the phenomena. You two are still missing a lot of information. Unfortunately, I can't give you any more hints...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' *cough* *cough*
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dunyarzad...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Sabzeruz Festival is happening every day, but that doesn't mean we can waste an infinite amount of them. Hurry and find the truth before today's festival ends.
;(The Traveler and Paimon move to a different location)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's think about our current situation... To save Dunyarzad, we have to escape the samsara of the Sabzeruz Festival...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And to do that, we need to figure out what's happening &mdash; the "truth"...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida rejected the idea of a time loop, so we must have missed something, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 6 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's memories say that we've already done this many times, but... let's go talk to people again. It's more productive than sitting here and scratching our heads... Why don't we start with... those stall owners?

;(Talk to Nahida again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq010 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We don't have many more festivals to waste. Hurry and find the truth.
----
;(Approach Amal)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there!
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 amal 01.ogg}} '''Amal:''' Hey, it's you guys again. Where's your cultured friend?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She... She's feeling a little unwell.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 amal 02.ogg}} '''Amal:''' I see. Did you come back to buy something? I guarantee the freshness of my products. I harvested them from the forest just yesterday.
:{{DIcon}} Have you felt anything strange lately?
:{{DIcon}} Do you ever feel like you're reliving the same day?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 amal 03.ogg}} '''Amal:''' Huh? What brought this about? I hurried back from the forest yesterday, and I'm selling produce here today. I haven't felt anything strange.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... To put it another way, if you really, really think about it, was "yesterday" truly "yesterday"? Did you actually come back from the forest yesterday?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 amal 04.ogg}} '''Amal:''' What kind of philosophical nonsense is this? Are you two daydreaming?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 amal 05.ogg}} '''Amal:''' Didn't you know that no one dreams in Sumeru? Go somewhere else if you want to find someone to daydream with, hahaha...
;(The Traveler and Paimon leave)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... He actually has a point. Is this a dream? Is everyone dreaming?
:{{DIcon}} Remember what he said just now...
:{{DIcon}} No one dreams in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hm, true. It's so weird that people here don't dream! Why is that?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, if this all really were just a dream, we would've woken up a long time ago. Let's keep asking around.

;(Approach Kimiya)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 01.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Oh, it's you two! Was my divination so accurate that you felt compelled to compliment me in person?
:{{DIcon}} We actually did run into a situation.
:{{DIcon}} But I'm not sure if it's related to your divination.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 02.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Oooh, I knew it! I told you, the gods' divination is highly accurate. You just hadn't fully understood its significance yet. Hahaha...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're really excited about this, huh... That's exactly why we came back. Help us better understand it!
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 03.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Er... Help you better understand it...? W&mdash;Well, that isn't exactly what I excel at...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you're admitting that you don't have a clue?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 04.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Anyway, what kind of situation did you get into?
:{{DIcon}} We're all trapped in the day of the Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{DIcon}} You've actually divined our fortune many, many times.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 05.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Huh? Hold on a second... I thought you guys just lost your wallet or fell for a scam...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 06.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' What you just said... Are you serious? Does that kind of thing actually happen in real life?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knew you weren't going to believe it!
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 07.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' Marvelous, truly marvelous... I believe you. Recall the interpretation of your divination... The Moon, illusions, and lies... It really felt like an omen.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When you say it like that, the divination does sound like it's related to what's going on. Can you read any more into it?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 08.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' I believe that the Archon's revelations are never more than vague hints. Anything more specific is beyond the reach of mere mortals.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 kimiya 09.ogg}} '''Kimiya:''' The book only says, "If you trust your instincts and overcome your fears, the sun will surely rise."
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's how it is... Looks like fortune-telling is just fortune-telling &mdash; it's no good for practical problems.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We haven't made any progress. Who else can we talk to?
:{{DIcon}} Let's try talking to Dehya again.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hm, Paimon remembers that we've tried talking to her a couple of times, but she always thinks that we're playing pranks on her. You think she'll brush us off again?
:{{DIcon}} She cares a lot about Dunyarzad...
:{{DIcon}} Let's try taking her to see the real Dunyarzad.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... If we tap into Dehya's strong sense of responsibility as a mercenary, then she'll definitely take us seriously.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' At this time of day, Dehya's probably just finished beating up those kidnappers. Let's go find her!

;(Approach Dehya and Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...I'm fine, my lady. It's just a scratch.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Perfect timing! Both of you are here.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Paimon, Traveler, you came at just the right time! Listen, there was a dangerous&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} A gang of kidnappers had just ambushed you.
:{{DIcon}} You just defeated a gang of kidnappers.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Huh, you saw? Then why didn't you jump in earlier? If someone was protecting Miss Dunyarzad, I could've went all-out. Anyway, can you do something for me?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You want the Traveler to take Dunyarzad somewhere to rest up while you check to see if there are still any kidnappers around. Did Paimon get that right?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...How did you know what I was going to say?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We need to say something convincing...

:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tell her, Traveler!
:{{DIcon}} You got injured because you aren't used to your current greatsword.
:{{DIcon}} You sold your greatsword to support the festival.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I didn't tell anyone about that, including Miss Dunyarzad. You couldn't have known... And just now, you literally took the words right out of my mouth. What's going on?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, so this is the situation...
:{{Black Screen|You explain everything to Dehya...}}
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It's kinda hard to believe what you just told me... First, let me make something clear: Most of us desert-dwellers might not be the scholarly type, but we do have basic common sense...
:{{DIcon}} Haven't you noticed something off about Dunyarzad?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's quieter than usual, uninterested in anything, and really gloomy...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Yeah, she isn't the same as before, but...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...Her parents said that this is how she was like at first.

:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I don't quite understand what you are all talking about. I'll go rest on the bench over there.

:{{DIcon}} Come with me. I'll show you some evidence.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 9 dehya 11.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...Alright. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt since you knew about my greatsword. Let's make this a quick trip &mdash; Miss Dunyarzad isn't completely safe here.

;(Talk to Dunyarzad on the bench)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq010 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' You all seem to have a matter to attend to. Don't worry about me. I'll be sitting here.

;(Talk to Nahida)
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida, we brought a friend. Are you busy?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...I thought I told you that it won't help to bring anyone here.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We just wanted her to see the real Dunyarzad's condition...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' The real Dunyarzad? ...Where? And who are you talking to?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' *sigh* I told you that you two are special. Other people can't see me or Miss Dunyarzad here.
;(Dehya focuses, then pays close attention to the nearby bed)

:{{DIcon}} Y&mdash;You can see her?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Wow, how perceptive... Does she have invisible antennae?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Miss Dunyarzad... she's lying down here, isn't she? How's she doing?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Her condition's really bad, and she's basically in a coma. How did you know she was here?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I can sense her aura... There are also lingering feelings of something like regret or disappointment. What happened...?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you believe us now? The Sabzeruz Festival has been repeating itself...
:{{Black Screen|You begin discussing the issue with Dehya, who finally understands the situation...}}
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...So you think the sages are behind this?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Yeah. They've always been against us. It wouldn't surprise me if they're using the [[Akasha]] to intentionally repeat the Sabzeruz Festival as a sick joke.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, you have a point... Aside from the Dendro Archon, the [[Akademiya]]'s sages are the only ones in Sumeru who could pull off something like this.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe there's more to the Akasha than we know?
:{{DIcon}} Nahida, can you tell us anything about the Akasha?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! Didn't you awaken our memories using something that looked like a Knowledge Capsule? That means you must know something about the Akasha!
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Akasha relies on the power of a [[Gnosis]] to operate, as it is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power. It compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and it grants knowledge to the people.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A Gnosis can do that!? No wonder the Akasha is so magical &mdash; it's being powered by the Gnosis of Sumeru's Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' So, this Nahida you mentioned... What did she say?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She said, and Paimon quotes: "The Akasha relies on the power of a Gnosis to operate, as it is the manifestation of the God of Wisdom's power. It compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and it grants knowledge to the people."
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and grants knowledge to the people... Wait...
:{{DIcon}} What's up?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I get the "grants knowledge" part &mdash; that's what people have always used the Akasha for. But compiling the entire populace's wisdom? How does that work?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did she mean that the sages enter new knowledge into the Akasha?
:{{DIcon}} Doubt it...
:{{DIcon}} Most information in the Akasha comes from [[Irminsul]].
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, that sounds about right. What do you think?

:{{color|menu|After going over what happened in detail, you believe it has something to do with "Abnormal Mental Fatigue"}}
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' You mean... The Akasha is causing our mental fatigue? Now that I think about it, my head's been feeling unusually heavy.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 10.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' When the desert-dwellers set off on their quest for knowledge, a sage once said, "Knowledge always comes at a price."
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 11.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Compiling the entire country's knowledge...You think the Akasha pulled a 180 and is extracting information from us?
:{{DIcon}} But how would it do that...?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 12.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Who knows? The Akasha can put knowledge into our heads, so who's to say that it can't also poke around in there? We don't know any specifics.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the point of doing something like that?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 13.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Just think about it... If you could combine the knowledge of every single person in Sumeru, then you can basically turn Sumeru City into a single, massive brain...
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 14.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...This hivemind could make breakthroughs in problems that even the smartest geniuses can't crack.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' An excellent deduction. And the analogy comparing Sumeru City to a massive brain? Ahh, I love it.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In that case, we should take off our Akasha Terminals right away! Maybe that'll solve this problem?
:{{DIcon}} It's worth a shot.
:{{DIcon}} Somehow, I don't think it'll be that simple.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 15.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Yeah. I was only wearing this for show in the first place. Didn't expect the Sages to cook up such a conspiracy... Mark my words, when this is over, I'm getting evidence and exposing this whole thing to the public!
:{{Black Screen|Everyone removes their Akasha Terminals...}}
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How does everyone feel?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I also noticed something else.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What is it?
:{{DIcon}} I feel like at the end of every day...
:{{DIcon}} There is always the sound of a beep.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that! Paimon knows what you're talking about! It's a single, soft beep that sounds like it's coming from the Akasha Terminal.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 16.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' The sound of a beep... Could it be a prompt tone for when the Akasha is operating?
:{{DIcon}} I heard the same sound in Port Ormos.
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's probably an important clue. We weren't using our terminals, but we heard a beep anyway...
:{{A|Akasha Terminal Beep.ogg}} '''???:''' *beep*
;(The screen now starts to become darker with every line of dialogue)
:{{DIcon}} !!!
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Traveler, did you hear that!?
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 17.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I heard it, too! Our ears aren't messing with us. There was definitely a beep, but it sounded like it was coming from inside my head!
:{{A|vo xmaq010 10 dehya 18.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' We took off our Akasha Terminals... How...?

*During ''[[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]]'', Nahida mentions that the total amount of Sabzeruz Samsara cycles ended with the 168th, meaning that during this quest the Traveler and Paimon experienced the 163rd loop, far higher than Paimon's final guess of "fortieth."
