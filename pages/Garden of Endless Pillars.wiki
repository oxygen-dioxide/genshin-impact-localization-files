{{Description|Many cities rose and fell like mirages in the night, as transient as falling meteors, in the days following the fall of the desert kingdom. Yet the garden of the [[Tulaytullah|city of sapphire]] has endured thanks to the protection of the [[Irminsul|white tree]] and the [[Ley Line]]s, and has now become a paradise for [[Fungi]]...}}
