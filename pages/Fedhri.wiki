===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing ''The Splendorous Sky That Day'')
:'''Fedhri:''' Hello there, are you the outlander offerer they spoke of? 
:{{DIcon}} The outlander offerer?
:'''Fedhri:''' Yes, I have heard of a valiant human who is bonded to a Pari. It has been centuries since this land last witnessed something so wondrous! 
:'''Fedhri:''' We Pari used to walk with humans, and we would both build our homes in this Vourukasha Oasis. 
:'''Fedhri:''' Despite the threat of the darkness, its corrosion never once stained the Oasis thanks to the protection of the Harvisptokhm and Khvarena. 
:'''Fedhri:''' Though centuries have passed, those years remain my most cherished memories. 
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, but who are you? 
:{{DIcon}} I didn't quite get you... 
:'''Fedhri:''' I can feel that you are indeed the one who has forged a {{Rubi|Laupa|connection}} with a Pari. 
:'''Fedhri:''' I'm in charge of looking after the Amrita Pool. I have not set foot outside this place since Lady Zurvan sealed the Oasis. 
:{{DIcon}} The Amrita Pool? 
:'''Fedhri:''' The Amrita Pool is where we Pari were granted life. In it flows the primordial water left behind by our god. 
:'''Fedhri:''' It's all thanks to the Amrita that countless motes of Khvarena have gained power and life. 
:'''Fedhri:''' We will turn into Plumes of Purifying Light after exhausting our strenght, leaving behind nothing but pure memories. 
:'''Fedhri:''' And memories that belong the Khvarena will return to the Harvisptokhm through the Amrita Pool. 
:'''Fedhri:''' The Amrita is all that is needed to wash away the deepest sadness and sorrow. With its nourishment, one shall regain their pristine form as the Khvarena's familiar. 
:'''Fedhri:''' And the offerer is the one who will help those familiars of Khvarena return to the sea of flowers. 
:'''Fedhri:''' But ever since human warriors ceased performing that duty, Pari who have drained their strength while resisting the defilement have not been able to return to the sea of flowers. 
:'''Fedhri:''' Fortunately, now that we've been visited by a human warrior once again, the scattered Plumes of Purifiyng Light shall return to this place eventually. 
:'''Fedhri:''' The Amrita Pool will accept all remembrances so long as an offering is made, and the waters and the tree will bestom blessings upon you. 
:'''Fedhri:''' This is also the mercy of the divine.

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing ''[[Heart of Amrita]]'')
:'''Fedhri:''' Outlander offerer, have you come bearing Plumes of Purifying Light for the Amrita Pool?
:{{DIcon}} About the Plume of Purifying Light...
::'''Fedhri:''' Plumes of Purifying Light are fragments of memory. Memories belonging to the divine bird, Pari, and humans. All those memories unable to return to the tree and the land will eventually become Plumes of Purifying Light.
::'''Fedhri:''' Although, should you offer them to the Amrita Pool, all memories will be accepted.
::'''Fedhri:''' You'll have to find those memories scattered across the land that have yet to become Plumes of Purifying Light.
:{{DIcon}} About the Amrita Pool...
::'''Fedhri:''' The primordial waters of the Amrita are also what imbued us Pari with life.
::'''Fedhri:''' Regardless of regret or woe, the Amrita can wash it away.
:{{DIcon}} About the offering...
::'''Fedhri:''' As long as you have an offering for the Amrita Pool, the waters and the tree will bestow upon you blessings.
::'''Fedhri:''' This is also the mercy of the divine.
