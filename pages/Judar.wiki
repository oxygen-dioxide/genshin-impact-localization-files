==Profile==
Judar and [[Morghi]] were sent by the [[Akademiya]] to kidnap the Village Keepers of [[Aaru Village]] with the aid of [[Rahman]]'s [[The Eremites|Eremite]] faction. After realizing the truth about [[King Deshret]]'s resurrection, Rahman later turns them in to be punished by [[Dehya]], [[Alhaitham]], [[Cyno]], and others. When Judar sees Cyno, he cowers in fear, afraid of being torn into pieces, and they reveal the Sages' plan to create a new god out of [[Scaramouche]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>

Judar and Morghi later assist Alhaitham by helping to repair the Canned Knowledge extraction devices as part of the plan to reenter Sumeru City and rescue [[Nahida]]. After Alhaitham has the [[Traveler]] use the devices to record a Canned Knowledge Capsule, he takes the two researchers to work on modifications to the [[Akasha System]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Through the Predawn Night}}</ref>
