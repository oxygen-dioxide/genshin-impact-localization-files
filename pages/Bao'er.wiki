==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Bao'er:''' Hello, traveler. Are you here to pay homage to history?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Bao'er:''' Trying to follow a trail of breadcrumbs, it feels like... Or, conducting an archaeological investigation, in technical terms.
::{{DIcon}} Breadcrumbs? I am a bit peckish...
:::'''Bao'er:''' ...Sorry if I wasn't clear. I'm an archaeologist; I'm researching the historical architecture and relics of the Guili Plains.
::{{DIcon}} You're an archaeologist?
:::'''Bao'er:''' Yes. We are standing right now on the battlefield where the [[Archon War]] took place all those thousands of years ago.
:::'''Bao'er:''' In other words, where the [[Morax|Geo Lord]] fought a bloody battle and secured a decisive and unequivocal victory against his enemies.
:::'''Bao'er:''' There must be countless artifacts waiting to be unearthed beneath our very feet.
:::'''Bao'er:''' I do long to know what treasures are buried here...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Bao'er:''' Fare thee well!
{{Dialogue end}}
