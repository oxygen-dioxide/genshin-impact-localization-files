:'''Hermosa:''' These photos are all pretty good... I guess I'll ask the editors to take their pick.

:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Hermosa/Everything's in the Effect|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Hermosa:''' A wonderfully close game! Certainly worthy of being saved as a commemorative photo to fill my Adventure Album!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Hermosa:''' Ugh... Should I take a photo of this defeat?
:{{DIcon}} Are you a photographer?
::'''Hermosa:''' I'm afraid not. I'm good at photography, yes, but I prefer the title "adventurer".
::'''Hermosa:''' I take my cat on various adventures and take many photos that tell a story.
::'''Hermosa:''' I mean, who says pictures can't tell stories? Some of these get published in the newspapers, and some get used as illustrations for books.
::'''Hermosa:''' Each one of my pictures will definitely contain my cat &mdash; makes them easy to identify, you know.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Hermosa:''' Hmm? Oh, yeah, bye.
