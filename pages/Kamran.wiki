===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:'''Kamran:''' If it wasn't for the forest's alleviating effect on the disease... Someone with [[Eleazar]] would have never been allowed to be a [[Forest Ranger]].
:{{DIcon}} Eleazar?
::'''Kamran:''' Huh? Who are you? What are you doing here? Why are you asking about that?
::{{DIcon}} I'm just passing by.
::'''Kamran:''' Right.
::'''Kamran:''' This is [[Gandharva Ville]]. You can rest here if you're tired.
::'''Kamran:''' If you don't want to be "educated" by the [[Forest Watcher]]s, then take a look at the stuff on the noticeboard.
::'''Kamran:''' Forgive me for being unable to say more.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Kamran:''' Oh, bye then.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:'''Kamran:''' I never thought I'd see the day when someone would be cured of Eleazar... though I suppose that'll mean the end of that [[Collei|young girl]]'s time with the Forest Rangers soon.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you referring to?
::'''Kamran:''' Huh? Who are you? What are you doing here? Why are you asking about that?
::{{DIcon}} I'm a friend of Tighnari's.
::'''Kamran:''' Oh, you're that Forest Watcher's friend, are you? My apologies.
::'''Kamran:''' I'm referring to a Trainee Forest Ranger who's been stationed with us.
::'''Kamran:''' She was here as part of her recuperation process from the first, so I reckon that she'll be leaving now that she's recovered.
::'''Kamran:''' Now, she has said that she wouldn't mind staying on as a Forest Ranger, but you know &mdash; people change their minds all the time.
::'''Kamran:''' You can't even trust what the sages say nowadays, so I'm not sure how hopeful I should be about anyone or anything else, you know?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Kamran:''' Oh, bye then.
