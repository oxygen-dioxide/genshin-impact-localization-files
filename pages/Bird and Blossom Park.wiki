|description    = A [[Mondstadt]]-style park lined with lush hedgerows and sturdy trees that surround a fountain. A passing breeze is sure to carry the lovely fragrances enjoyed by finches and butterflies.<br>In the eyes of some poets, flowers and birds are a symbol of goodness and nature. As such, bards will sometimes sing by the fountains, which often attracts the attention of passers-by &mdash; and their various pets, of course.
