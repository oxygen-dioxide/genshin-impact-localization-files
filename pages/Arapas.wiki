===Dialogue Set #1===
''(Available during [[An Unwavering Culinary Dream]])''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arapas''': Is there water that can give taste to soup?
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''(Available after [[An Unwavering Culinary Dream]])''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arapas:''' The soup using Vanarana water, tastes almost the same with that using "Living Spring"...
:{{DIcon}} They are both nice water, after all.
::'''Arapas:''' Well said, Nara (Traveler). Nara (Traveler), so smart, as if you have been drinking Vanarana water all the time.
::'''Arapas:''' This time, soup using Vanarana water for Nara (Traveler). Next time, I will find nicer water.
:{{DIcon}} The taste is key...
::'''Arapas:''' The taste... Hmm...
::'''Arapas:''' I heard that follow the running river and you find a big area of water with strong scent. Nara (Traveler) wants soup with that water?
::{{DIcon}} Sounds much too strong...
::'''Arapas:''' Really? Nara (Traveler), so strange. You said water with scent is delicious, but you hate water with too much scent.
::'''Arapas:''' Guess clear water is better for soup.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Arapas:''' Bye, hope Nara (Traveler) will always have delicious water to drink.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''(Available after ???)''{{Verify}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arapas:''' The soup at Festival Utsava... Very "shocking." So I am going to look for nicer water in the north.
:{{DIcon}} The north?
::'''Arapas:''' I heard that there is Vana's river source's source in the north. The water there is clearer than moonlight. A pot filled with that water looks as if is holding nothing but air.
::'''Arapas:''' Soup cooked with that water, will make Nara (Traveler) and Aranara happy. I am sure.
::'''Arapas:''' So, in my "special cooking training," I will follow the direction that tree shadows point to, and find nicer water than Vanarana water.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Arapas:''' Hope to see Nara (Traveler) in the north.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #4===
''(Available after ???)''{{Verify}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arapas:''' Vanarana water is nice. But I heard, in the north, there is sweeter and clearer water...
