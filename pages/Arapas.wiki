==Profile==
Arapas and his "family" met the [[Traveler's Sibling]] sometime before the [[cataclysm]], where he and his brothers became interested in cooking after watching them cook. However, they quickly ended up arguing and were kicked out of Vanarana by [[Arapacati]], where they went their separate ways.

Arapas headed for [[Apam Woods]] in order to create the "perfect" soup, experimenting at least eighty times by drawing water from varying sources. On his most recent attempt, he was out picking fresh [[Harra Fruit]]s when the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] smelled his soup cooking. Paimon consumed the soup just as Arapas returned, shocked that his work had gone to waste. 

The two informed Arapas about the upcoming [[Festival Utsava]] and that they had been sent by [[Arapacati]]. Arapas was eager to showcase his soup, but because he had no more water, had the two fetch him [[Living Spring|extra water]] from the desired spot. When they returned with it, he instructed them on the process of making the soup. The Traveler drank the soup, finding that it had the aroma of the ingredients, but had no flavor. They suggested adding [[salt]] and [[pepper]], much to his horror, claiming that salt would wither the Aranara and that they had been told by the Golden Nara that soups were meant to be bland but have a distinguished aroma. As such, he did not believe their input, but agreed to make it taste better. Paimon would salvage his recipe into the more appealing [[Masala Cheese Balls]].

Once the brothers returned to Vanarana, they were all scolded by Arapacati. When the festival began, Arapas told the Traveler to fetch some nearby water for soup. They created a [[Radish Veggie Soup]] and gave it to Arapas and the others, though he did not enjoy it, claiming that Vanarana's water was the best and was perplexed by how something like the soup was made from it.

::'''Arapas:''' I heard that there is Vana's river source's source in the north. The water there is clearer than moonlight. A pot filled with that water looks as if is holding nothing but air.
::'''Arapas:''' Soup cooked with that water, will make Nara {{Traveler}} and Aranara happy. I am sure.
::'''Arapas:''' So, in my "special cooking training," I will follow the direction that tree shadows point to, and find nicer water than Vanarana water.
