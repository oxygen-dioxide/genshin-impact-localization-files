|desc_1      = Summons a massive vortex which [[Vacuum Field|pulls]] players towards its center. A massive bubble forms and explodes within the vortex, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.

* While the Arena is active:
** Characters within it lose all [[Energy]] and cannot gain Energy.
** Characters within it deal '''120%''' increased DMG, and [[Nightsoul's Blessing|Nightsoul]]-aligned DMG is additionally increased by '''60%'''.
** The Wayob Manifestation summons waves that move outward in a X-shaped pattern 3 times, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.
* If the Arena's duration ends and the shield is not destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation summons a massive burst of water, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}, and converts the remaining percentage of its shield to a {{Hydro}} elemental shield.{{Elemental Shield Data|Hydro|48|Maximum}}
* If the non-elemental shield is destroyed before the Arena's duration ends, a massive amount of Elemental Particles will spawn, restoring '''90''' base Energy. The actual amount restored will vary based on [[Energy Recharge]], whether the character is on or off-field, and the number of characters in the party.
* When either shield is active, the Wayob Manifestation is immune to all DMG.
* When either shield is destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation becomes paralyzed for 5 seconds.

When in close proximity with the player, it will explode after a delay, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}. The Hydroflow Constructs can be frozen when hit with {{Cryo}}. Once frozen, hitting it with a [[Charged Attack]] will send it rolling forward. Upon hitting the Local Legend, it will reduce its shield by '''64 GU''' and deal {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to it.

|name_4      = Water Spout
|desc_4      = Summons a water spout at the player's location, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} upon appearance. The water spout will linger for a few seconds and can be frozen into a pillar when hit with {{Cryo}}. The frozen pillar can be used to block DMG from '''Equitable Judgment'''.

|desc_5      = Summons 6 '''Water Spouts''' across the arena, then releases a continuous water jet at the player for 10 seconds, continuously dealing '''250% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}. The player must take cover behind a frozen pillar in order to avoid DMG from this attack.

|name_6      = Rupturing Blast
|desc_6      = Charges and fires a beam of water, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}. This attack is only used while unshielded.

While charging, '''Hydroflow Constructs''' will spawn around the arena. These Hydroflow Constructs will slowly move towards the Local Legend to be absorbed. When the Local Legend successfully absorbs a Hydroflow Construct, its shield will recover '''64 GU'''. If the charging process successfully completes, releases a massive blast covering the entire arena, dealing '''400% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|The [[People of the Springs]] believe in and worship the Wayob, which manifests upon the land with the power of totems and Nightsouls.<br>The so-called "Wayob" is the belief that gradually formed primarily from the tribes and obsidian totems after the people of Natlan began communicating with the kingdom of the [[Lord of the Night]]. A "Wayob" is a consciousness of collective thought, and the home of the ancestors' souls.<br>The People of the Springs believe their Wayob has the power to control the tides and waves, and can control the changes of flowing and still, dead waters alike.|[[Archive]]}}
