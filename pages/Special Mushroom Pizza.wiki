'''Special Mushroom Pizza''' is a [[food]] item that can only be bought from the [[Kiminami Restaurant]] after either completing the quest [[Pizza From Another Land]], or selecting the "local" ingredient options when writing down the recipe during the "Food From Afar" section of the quest [[The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit]].

Special Mushroom Pizza is identical to its inspiration, the normal [[Mushroom Pizza]], except for its description and its appearance, which includes blue and purple toppings.

Only the [[Cooking#Manual Cooking|Regular]] version of this item exists.

==Trivia==
*While helping [[Kiminami Anna]] in the [[Pizza From Another Land]] quest, she asks for 1 [[Lavender Melon]] as an ingredient for the Special Mushroom Pizza in one branch. Along with constructive criticism that Kiminami took, we can assume that the pizza's toppings are made of Inazuma's local specialties. The pizza's base remains the same, however.
*Its description seems to call the pizza a "pancake", despite the name of the food being "Special Mushroom '''Pizza'''".
