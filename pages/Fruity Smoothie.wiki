|desc_suspicious = A beverage of simple and clean colors. The freezing-cold smoothie seems to send you directly to the peak of Dragonspine. It's so cold up there, you can feel yourself accumulating Sheer Cold... You'd better find a bonfire quickly to stave off the damage before you hit the limit!
|desc_basic      = A beverage with simple colors. The smoothie made out of fruit-flavored yogurt has been arranged to resemble the blue sky and white clouds. At the bottom is a thick layer of jelly and finely-cut fruit. The revitalizing flavor makes this beverage the best choice in the summer.
|desc_delicious  = A beverage of simple and clean colors. The refreshing smoothie with a faint fruity scent reminds you of the ethereal clouds above Qingyun Peak. Does it taste as light and fluffy?
