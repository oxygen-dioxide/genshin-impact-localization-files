==Profile==
Borenka serves as a naval intelligence officer for the [[Fatui]]. He was sent to [[Inazuma]] to collect Shogunate remnants recommended by [[Nathan]] for [[Pierro|First Lord Harbinger]]. However, the remnants caused unnecessary attention to themselves that resulted in [[Shizuru]] and the [[Traveler]] to investigate and confront Borenka. After being defeated the first time, Borenka withdrew and chugged some Fire-Water, leaving his subordinates to handle them. However, they were unable to do so and Borenka fought them a second time, only to be defeated. He withdrew with the rest of his forces in a haste, swearing revenge on the two.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Borenka's "Orders":''' "...Be sure to withdraw with all haste and bring the new Inazuman recruits who retrieved the secret report that '[[Nathan]]' wrote to the [[Pierro|First Lord Harbinger]]."
:'''Borenka's "Orders":''' "To prevent any repercussions from this incident, no one must know about the inner workings of what happened on Yashiori Island."
:'''Borenka's "Orders":''' "The new recruits do not have any innate value to the overall goals of the Fatui, and need not be trained in any way. They will, however, do just fine as living test samples."
