==Profile==
Borenka serves as a naval intelligence officer for the [[Fatui]]. He was sent to [[Inazuma]] to collect Shogunate remnants recommended by [[Nathan]] for the [[Pierro|First Lord Harbinger]]. However, the remnants caused unnecessary attention to themselves that resulted in [[Shizuru]] and the [[Traveler]] coming to investigate and confront Borenka. Initially playing themselves off as new recruits, they decided to throw away their cover after Borenka refused to reveal any information on their orders. After being defeated once, Borenka withdrew and chugged some Fire-Water, leaving his subordinates to handle them. However, they were unable to do so and Borenka fought them a second time, only to be defeated for good.

===Appearance===
Borenka takes the appearance of a [[Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Borenka's "Orders":''' "...Be sure to withdraw with all haste and bring the new Inazuman recruits who retrieved the secret report that '[[Nathan]]' wrote to the First Lord Harbinger."<ref group="Note">The original Chinese text makes it clear that the "First Lord Harbinger" is Pierro, the Director of the Fatui, rather than Il Capitano: {{Lang|…Please evacuate as soon as possible and hand over the Inazuma recruit who found "Nathan"'s secret report to the Lord Chief Executive Officer."|zh=…请务必尽快撤离，将寻回『内森』秘密报告的稻妻新兵交予首席执行官大人。}}</ref>
:'''Borenka's "Orders":''' "To prevent any repercussions from this incident, no one must know about the inner workings of what happened on Yashiori Island."
:'''Borenka's "Orders":''' "The new recruits do not have any innate value to the overall goals of the Fatui, and need not be trained in any way. They will, however, do just fine as living test samples."
