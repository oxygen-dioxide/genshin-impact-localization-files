'''Maushiro''' is a Quest Item obtained during the "[[A Particularly Particular Author]]" [[World Quest]] on [[Tsurumi Island]]. However, when the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] returns to [[Narukami Island]], they "lose" the Maushiro and it is silently removed from the player's [[Inventory]]. It is re-obtained during "[[Octave of the Maushiro]]" and then given to [[Sumida]].

==Trivia==
* The name "Maushiro" is based on {{Lang|mini=1|ain=マゥシロ|ain_rm=mawsiro}}, the {{w|Ainu language|Ainu}} word for "whistling."
*It is based on the {{W|Mukkuri}}, a traditional Ainu mouth harp made of bamboo.
