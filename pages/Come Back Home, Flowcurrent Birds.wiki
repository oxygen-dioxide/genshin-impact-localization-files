==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Pania and Iwai)
:'''Pania:''' ...Hmm, why are they still not coming over...

;(If no Flowcurrent Birds have been brought to shore)
:;(Talk to Pania or Iwai)
:::'''Paimon:''' Wow, there's so much fish! What are you all doing here?
:::'''Pania:''' Hmm? Oh, hey there, {{MC|m=Big Bro|f=Big Sis}} Blondie! And your, uh... White... little sister, I guess?
:::'''Pania:''' Iwai and I are waiting for the Flowcurrent Birds to return to shore. Not much else to do right now, anyway.
:::'''Paimon:''' Return to shore? Really?
:::'''Iwai:''' Hrroo, roooh!
:::'''Pania:''' Alright, come on, Iwai. You're a good kid, aren't you? Now be patient. There's no need to rush.
:::'''Iwai:''' Rroo...
:::'''Pania:''' Anyway, our original plan was to come down here to play. But no one else usually comes down here other than Uncle [[Rongo]], so this is our super secret base... or something like that, anyway!
:;(Investigate the fish)
:::'''Paimon:''' Wow, that's a ton of fish!
:::'''Pania:''' Wait, don't move, {{MC|m=Big Bro|f=Big Sis}} Blondie! Those are bait to attract Flowcurrent Birds!
:::'''Paimon:''' Uh, attract Flowcurrent Birds?
:::'''Pania:''' Yeah! Iwai and I are waiting for the Flowcurrent Birds to return to shore. Not much else to do right now, anyway.
:::'''Iwai:''' Hrroo, roooh!
:::'''Pania:''' Alright, come on, Iwai. You're a good kid, aren't you? Now be patient. There's no need to rush.
:::'''Iwai:''' Rroo...
:::'''Pania:''' Anyway, our original plan was to come down here to play. I mean, no one else usually comes down here other than Uncle Rongo anyway, so this is our super secret base... or something like that!
::'''Pania:''' But we didn't think that these birds would steal a march on us today.
::'''Pania:''' And that's why I've got all this fish ready to lure them over with. Flowcurrent Birds love the stuff!
::{{DIcon}} Really? They don't seem all that attracted by it.
::{{DIcon}} I see, so "Paimon" is in fact a subspecies of Flowcurrent Bird...
:::'''Pania:''' Round like a roly-poly, and fond of fish... Yeah, I can see where you're coming from.
:::'''Iwai:''' Mmm! Mmmm!
:::'''Paimon:''' What? No! Anyway, back to the point &mdash; you haven't lured any Flowcurrent Birds over at all!
::'''Pania:''' Yeah. Could be that we're too far away, and they can't smell the fish? If only we could get 'em ashore somehow...
::'''Pania:''' If Uncle Rongo was here, he'd say something like {{Color|buzzword|"Just boop them all ashore, why don't you?"}}... Iwai and I don't have the raw strength for that though. They'd blow us away instead, I'd bet.

;(If a Flowcurrent Bird has been brought to shore)
::'''Pania:''' Ah, thanks a lot, {{MC|m=Big Bro|f=Big Sis}} Blondie! And your, uh... White... little sister? Either way, thanks for getting the Flowcurrent birds back ashore!
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, and what were you doing here?
::'''Pania:''' Iwai and I are waiting for the Flowcurrent Birds to return to shore. Not much else to do right now, anyway.
::'''Iwai:''' Hrroo, roooh!
::'''Pania:''' Alright, come on, Iwai. You're a good kid, aren't you? Now be patient. There's no need to rush.
::'''Iwai:''' Rroo...
::'''Pania:''' Anyway, our original plan was to come down here to play. I mean, no one else usually comes down here other than Uncle Rongo anyway, so this is our super secret base... or something like that!
::'''Pania:''' But we didn't think that these birds would steal a march on us today.
::'''Pania:''' And that's why I've got all this fish ready to lure them over with. Flowcurrent Birds love the stuff!
::{{DIcon}} So that's the situation.
::{{DIcon}} I see, so "Paimon" is in fact a subspecies of Flowcurrent Bird...
:::'''Pania:''' Round like a roly-poly, and fond of fish... Yeah, I can see where you're coming from.
:::'''Iwai:''' Mmm! Mmmm!
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh? No way!
::'''Pania:''' Could be that they can't even see the fish I laid out from that far away. If you could lure them ashore, {{MC|Big Bro|Big Sis}}, they'd take the bait for sure!
::'''Pania:''' So, could you do the same thing you did earlier, and get all the Flowcurrent Birds to come ashore?
::'''Paimon:''' Yup, yup, sure thing. Just leave it to us!
----
;(Talk to Pania again, optional)
:'''Pania:''' Alright, patience... patience... All we gotta do is wait for the Flowcurrent Birds to come ashore...
:'''Iwai:''' Hroo, roo! 
:'''Paimon:''' Let's try booping those Flowcurrent Birds ashore, shall we?

;(After returning one Flowcurrent Bird to the shore)
:'''Pania:''' Hehe, I knew it! No such thing as a Flowcurrent Bird that doesn't like fish! Now there's only two left!

;(After returning two Flowcurrent Birds to the shore)
:'''Pania:''' Yeah, just like that! Nearly done now! If we can just manage to lure the last one onto the shore...

;(After returning all Flowcurrent Birds to the shore)
:'''Pania:''' Hmm... That must be the last of them, right?
----
;(After completing the objective)
:;(Iwai swims around in the water)
:'''Pania:''' Thank you! The birds have been attracted by the fish, and Iwai and I can go play now!
:'''Iwai:''' Hroo, roo!
:{{DIcon}} Just glad I could help.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon seems to have been attracted by the fish as well...
::'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Was not! Paimon'll never be attracted to ingredients that haven't yet been cooked into a delicious dish yet... Yup, absolutely not, no way!
:'''Pania:''' See you around, then! If you've got time, feel free to swing by and play, alright?
