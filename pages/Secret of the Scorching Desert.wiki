:{{A|vo xmaq106 1 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Looks like we have everyone here. ...Isak, are you sure you want to come with us?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 1 isak 01.ogg}} '''Isak:''' I'll watch from a safe distance. Dehya... I wanna be there to bring Grandpa home.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 1 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Okay. Let's go then.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 1 candace 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Dehya, wait.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 1 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' What's the matter?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 1 candace 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' I heard that you were quite reckless yesterday... No more of that today, understood? Or I'll be very upset with you.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 1 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' *sigh* Fine.

;(Approach the marked area behind the Mausoleum of King Deshret)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Heh, they got here before us.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, is it because Paimon overslept by five minutes and held everyone up?
:{{DIcon}} You didn't have to admit to that.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 rahman 01.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Is everything ready?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Absolutely. Although...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...You brought fewer people than I imagined.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 rahman 02.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Bring him over.

:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why is there only one of them?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Rahman, I've always thought of you as a man of his word. What's this about?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 rahman 03.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' It's a one-for-one exchange. Sounds fair, don't ya think?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 rahman 04.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Or lemme put it this way... Agreeing to any kind of deal with the Dendro Archon's people is already a huge compromise on my part. Don't you think you've asked enough?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 2 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...Uh-uh, you stay right there!

:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Paimon's dizzy...
:{{DIcon}} Mmph...
::{{DIcon}} Is everyone okay!?
:;(The Traveler looks around to find that they have fallen into a large pit)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Ugh, this day's going just great...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Hmph, what a nuisance.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The sand dune collapsed.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I saw an energy field... The [[Village Keeper]] protected us.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It glowed green with Dendro. Just like you said, it may well have been the remains of Lesser Lord Kusanali's power inside the scholar's body.
:{{DIcon}} No doubt.
::{{DIcon}} You finally believe me.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...The Dendro Archon... The present one.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 isak 01.ogg}} '''Isak:''' Grandpa? Grandpa? Oh no, he's getting confused again...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Hey, look around you.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Did there use to be a... temple here?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It seems that when the sand dune collapsed, it exposed these underground structures.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The symbols on the gate belong to King Deshret's civilization. This structure must be ancient... Over time, the sandstorms completely buried it, and left it in the state we see now.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...It could have been an underground palace in the distant past.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 rahman 01.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Ohhh... A miracle! Praise King Deshret!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's he doing here!? And his men, too?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' They must have fallen down here with us. Pretty lucky if you ask me.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 memberb 01.ogg}} '''Eremite Mercenary:''' Ugh... Oh...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Most of them seem in really bad shape, except for him. He got off lightly.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 rahman 02.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' ...Hmph.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Mind your head.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 rahman 03.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' No no, this isn't the time for conflict... Our exalted lord has shown us the way to his sacred palace.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's not actually gonna go in there, is he...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' As it happens, I want to take a look inside, too.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you doing!?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Don't you think it's curious? One minute, Lesser Lord Kusanali's power protects us from harm, and the next... remnants of King Deshret's civilization appear.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Two major deities are vying to showcase their power to us. It would be a shame not to witness them both.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thought you weren't interested in gods!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Indeed. In my view, gods are just a higher form of living being... or "creature," you could say.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' New discoveries are always worth investigating. Whether they have anything to do with gods is neither here nor there.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Rahman, what are you gonna do about your men?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 rahman 04.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' I'll just let them lay here &mdash; King Deshret will take care of his people... Right now, I'm going inside.

;(Talk to the Eremite Mercenary)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 memberb 01.ogg}} '''Eremite Mercenary:''' Ugh... Oh...

;(Talk to Isak)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 isak 01.ogg}} '''Isak:''' Grandpa? Grandpa? Oh no, he's getting confused again...

;(Enter the [[Mysterious Ruins]] domain)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's full of life here.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' This defies comprehension... It looked completely desolate from the outside, yet it flows with energy inside.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, and there's so many plants. It's so pretty.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Sir Rahman.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 rahman 01.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' ...Huh? Me?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Do you see another Rahman here?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 rahman 02.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Are you mocking me? What do you mean, "Sir"?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Interpret it however you want, but there's something I'd like to draw your attention to. While this structure is clearly left over from King Deshret's civilization, the energy that flows in here is that of the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 rahman 03.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 rahman 04.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Whatever you say. It's not like I have a Vision.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' There's nothing to be angry about. Think of this as an academic journey.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It does seem kinda strange. If that's true, then... we might have to explore this whole area to find an explanation.

;(Interact with the Ceremonial Guide)
:'''Ceremonial Guide:''' Look up at the hall as a mortal and listen to King Deshret's holy guidance.
----
;(Interact with the Mysterious Message)
:'''Mysterious Message:''' After six days infiltrating the temple, I finally understand the priests' parlor tricks.
:'''Mysterious Message:''' {{Color|buzzword|The elevator will descend to the ground. Get on top of it before it starts ascending again to reach the dome.}}
:'''Mysterious Message:''' Nonsense like "Forbidden ground ahead, mortals shall not pass" or whatever are just made up by the priests to hoodwink us.
:'''Mysterious Message:''' I leave this method here in hopes that the people of King Deshret who shall travel here in the future shall freely enjoy the privilege of witnessing his sacred presence.
----
;(After solving the final elevator puzzle)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 rahman 05.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Now that's a sight to see... King Deshret's splendor surrounds us.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' There's so much vegetation here. It's different than what I expected.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure are a lot of plants for a desert!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 3 rahman 06.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Heheh, that's what I call divine providence of King Deshret.
----
;(Approach the tree in the center)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's getting brighter! Ooh, it looks so beautiful!

;(Reach the tree in the center)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Wait.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' What's that?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A load of flowers... And it looks like there's something among them...
:{{DIcon}} It looks like a tomb.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 01.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' These are King Deshret runes...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' They left something behind... Yes, it's an elegy written in an ancient script.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' What does it say?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' "Here lies our faithful priest, Kasala."
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' "His wisdom is a miracle among the people, deserving of high praise and admiration."
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 02.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' You can read ancient King Deshret script?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Of course. Every student needs to master at least 20 languages before they graduate.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's not serious, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There's still something off about this place... The elemental energy here is too concentrated.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The scent of life... Is it trying to tell us something?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Hm...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Is this it?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 system 01.ogg}} '''System Sound:''' Analyzing...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' There seems to be a hidden message among these skeletal remains.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Excellent. There's a device from King Deshret's civilization in this gravesite. I'll transmit the information over and project it for everyone to see.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 03.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Isn't sharing knowledge against the Akademiya's rules?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Yes. However, under the circumstances, I'd prefer you to see this for yourself.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' You'll understand after watching it.
;(A [[#Gallery|cinematic]] plays)
{{Cutscene Description|The record left by the owner of these remains reveals something of the bygone ages to you:}}
::'''Kasala:''' Civilization is born of knowledge
::'''Kasala:''' But so, too, can knowledge be its demise
::'''Kasala:''' A disaster caught us unaware
::'''Kasala:''' It was knowledge that did not belong to this world
::'''Kasala:''' The Scarlet King (King Deshret) brought this forbidden knowledge into our world
::'''Kasala:''' And it quickly spread like a plague
::'''Kasala:''' People's minds were filled with crazed whispers
::'''Kasala:''' Dark gray scales spread across their bodies
::'''Kasala:''' Even the land was stripped of its vigor
::'''Kasala:''' Only a desperate, deathly silence remained
::'''Kasala:''' Were it not for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the forests
::'''Kasala:''' The damage would have been irreversible
::'''Kasala:''' She summoned the priests to build temples
::'''Kasala:''' And infused into them the divine power of life
::'''Kasala:''' The disaster was miraculously tempered
::'''Kasala:''' And the embers of our civilization were preserved in Aaru Village
::'''Kasala:''' Alas, the miracle could not last
::'''Kasala:''' As long as forbidden knowledge continued to exist
::'''Kasala:''' It would forever blight this world
::'''Kasala:''' In the end
::'''Kasala:''' The proud king of the desert... my eternal lord...
::'''Kasala:''' Chose to sacrifice himself
::'''Kasala:''' I have spent my whole life since guarding one of these many temples
::'''Kasala:''' But now, my duty is coming to an end
::'''Kasala:''' As I close my eyes for the final time
::'''Kasala:''' The sight of that noble deity will appear in my vision once more...
::'''Kasala:''' In helping the Scarlet King (King Deshret) to eradicate forbidden knowledge
::'''Kasala:''' She exhausted her strength, and her form became that of a small child
::'''Kasala:''' How strange
::'''Kasala:''' Now that I think of her, I no longer have any fear of death...
::'''Kasala:''' For I sense that
::'''Kasala:''' The spirit of life will abide with me during my eternal sleep
::'''Kasala:''' Children of the desert
::'''Kasala:''' Cling no longer to past grievances
::'''Kasala:''' But hold tight to the memory
::'''Kasala:''' Of this act of benevolence

:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 04.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' No... no! Impossible!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Greater Lord Rukkhadevata... So the former Dendro Archon and King Deshret were never enemies at all...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 05.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' But... this doesn't make any sense! The Dendro Archon's followers... they're clearly...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Was that the former Dendro Archon? She became so tiny in the end...
:'''(Traveler):''' (...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Greater Lord Rukkhadevata came to the rescue of King Deshret and his people, but eradicating the forbidden knowledge took so much of her power...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (The two deities' followers have resented each other all this time, completely unaware that their gods stuck by each other through life and death.)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 13.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' You might be distrustful of the Akasha, but there's no reason for you to doubt King Deshret's technology.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 alhaitham 14.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' You've just witnessed his priest's last words.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 06.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' I've... never heard about any of this before...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 07.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' The surviving followers of King Deshret all gathered in Aaru Village. Our god did not make mistakes... We refused to believe any of the rumors.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 08.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' King Deshret's death, the all-but-total annihilation of our civilization... It was all Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's doing!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 09.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' We saw her as nothing more than a traitor, who stabbed us in the back in our moment of crisis... Just like us humans, fighting, feuding, double-crossing each other to survive in the desert.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You were blinded by your prejudice.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 10.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Hah... haha... If I hadn't seen this for myself... If I hadn't witnessed his last words with my own eyes, ears, and heart...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 11.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' How could I ever begin to accept this? The truth is so far from what I've always known. Am I really supposed to believe that after all these years... All this time seeking revenge... Suddenly now my enemy is my savior!?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Rahman... That's enough.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Give it a rest. You're starting to make a fool of yourself.

:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 13.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' My Eremites and I... What are we even fighting for?

:'''Rahman takes some time to collect his thoughts, while the rest of the party continues to explore the temple.'''

:'''Rahman's reaction is nothing strange. To any believer, the truth he had just witnessed would have been difficult to accept.'''

:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 14.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' ...I'll live, heh. Thanks.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 15.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' I should probably go. I can't just stay here forever.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' What's your next move gonna be?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 16.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' I know what you're going to ask... I feel deeply ashamed of everything I've done. You'll get everything you're asking for.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 17.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' But please, give me some time. After everything that's happened here today... Somehow, I need to explain it to the others.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It's not gonna be easy.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 18.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Well, I guess that's for me to deal with. Dehya, this is where our camp's located. Make a note of it.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' When would be a good time for us to go?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 19.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Tomorrow. I'll convince everyone that we're all on the same side.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 20.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' And I'll return every last one of your mad&mdash; Sorry, your Village Keepers. We'll share our other resources with you, too.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You seem to finally understand that our true enemy is the sages.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 rahman 21.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Yes. The gods never gave up on anyone. It's the people responsible for all this that need to face the consequences of their actions.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That must've been rough, but he seems to have figured things out now.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' *sigh* Rahman's no fool. Being the leader of your own faction in the desert is no easy feat.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 5 dehya 10.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It's too bad he was held back by his belief in King Deshret, but now that that's changed, I guess we have a few more people on our side.
:{{DIcon}} This is a turn for the better.

:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Where are the perpetrators?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 rahman 04.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' I'll bring you to them. Follow me.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' So these are the people who kidnapped the Village Keepers.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 01.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' Oh no, it's the scribe!?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' There's no need to yell. No one can help you now.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been all over the desert trying to find you!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 02.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' General Mahamatra!? No, no! M&mdash;Make it quick, please! Swift and painless...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, the moment they set eyes on Cyno, they turn pale like they've seen a ghost...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You should've known that I would be coming for you.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 03.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' W&mdash;Wait! We were just following orders! You know what I'm talking about, right? Th&mdash;There's no way we could've done all this by ourselves!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 01.ogg}} '''Judar:''' No, not Cyno... He's gonna tear us limb from limb!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I could do worse.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 04.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' P&mdash;Please have mercy!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Start talking. Otherwise, I'll have to resort to... other methods.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' So... Your superiors have kept you quite busy recently. Why? What are they trying to accomplish?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 02.ogg}} '''Judar:''' Um... they, um, wanted to extract Canned Knowledge...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Don't play dumb. You know what I'm really asking.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' They extract Divine Canned Knowledge... then what?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 05.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' I... I, uh, really don't know how to explain it...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you better start talking, or you'll be sorry!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' You don't wanna make things any more difficult for yourself, do ya?
:{{DIcon}} May I ask them a question?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Be my guest.
:{{DIcon}} The sages are trying to create a new god, aren't they?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' !
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Huh? That sure didn't sound like a fancy metaphor or anything... You're serious, aren't you?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 06.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' How did you know?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 03.ogg}} '''Judar:''' There's no use hiding it now... Yes, you're right.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 04.ogg}} '''Judar:''' The Akademiya is working on an important and potentially world-changing project. They are creating a new god... a god that will belong to them, and to the people of Sumeru.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 05.ogg}} '''Judar:''' It may seem as if Sumeru's academics are thriving, but ever since the death of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, scholarly breakthroughs have been few and far between.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 06.ogg}} '''Judar:''' The withering of Irminsul has been getting worse recently. The sages have tried everything they could think of, but nothing's worked. I'm always hearing them say things like, "If only Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was still with us..."
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Continue.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 07.ogg}} '''Judar:''' And then, someone from the Fatui showed up. They called him "The Doctor"... He brought a... a "Gnosis," and said he wanted to borrow the Akademiya's research facilities.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 08.ogg}} '''Judar:''' The Doctor was previously expelled from the Akademiya. At first, the sages looked down at him in disdain... But when he said those words, everyone's expression changed.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 09.ogg}} '''Judar:''' He asked them: "Do you wish to create a god?"
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...This is what the arrogant ignorance at the extreme end of academia looks like.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 10.ogg}} '''Judar:''' First, the Akademiya spent a long time constructing a "divine vessel," which was based on an exquisite humanoid puppet.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 11.ogg}} '''Judar:''' After that, they harvested dreams via the Sabzeruz Festival samsara, maximizing the Akasha's output...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 12.ogg}} '''Judar:''' With The Doctor's help, and the Akasha now functioning at maximum efficiency, they were able to use it to extract the power from the Gnosis and convert it into a "divine core."
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 judar 13.ogg}} '''Judar:''' Next, they decided that their new god needed to possess "divine wisdom." For that to happen... they needed a huge quantity of Divine Canned Knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...It adds up.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' But how do you determine whether the knowledge extracted is of divine origin?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 07.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' Call it an educated guess... The Akademiya has been trying to figure out the exact source of the scholars' madness for centuries, but to no avail...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 08.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' Nobody can explain the cause of this phenomenon. Surely you can see what that implies, Scribe Alhaitham?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 09.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' If it's knowledge no mortal can comprehend, then it must be something only gods are able to decipher. In other words... it's the source of the God of Wisdom's omniscience and omnipotence.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} But the sages' end product won't be Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
:{{DIcon}} It will be The Balladeer.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' You must have noticed by now &mdash; the Akademiya doesn't care about who their god is. It's the ability to exercise control over knowledge and wisdom that matters.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It is as if they are cursed with a desire for omniscience and omnipotence that burns in their blood.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Some organisms demonstrate phototaxis, and thus orient their entire lives in respect to sources of light. For the sages, their only source of hope is the existence of a deity who embodies the acme of wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 alhaitham 13.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' This is but a form of phototaxis. For many scholars, the absence of a God of Wisdom means stumbling in the darkness for the duration of their lives.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 09a 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Then what does Lesser Lord Kusanali mean to you?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 09b 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Is she not a true god present in this world? If you already have a new god, why try to create another one?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 10.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' ...From the beginning, the Akademiya has never treated her as a god.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 11.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' When the Akademiya first discovered Lesser Lord Kusanali, the newborn God of Wisdom, the sages hoped that she would be as wise as Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. But upon evaluation...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 12.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' They found that, at that time, she possessed no more intelligence than any ordinary human child. The sages never had a ruder awakening... This forced them to accept that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had indeed passed away.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 13.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' Not to mention that Lesser Lord Kusanali's Gnosis has been used to power the Akasha this entire time. By herself, she has neither an archon's raw power, nor the spectacular insight expected of a God of Wisdom...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 morghi 14.ogg}} '''Morghi:''' Slowly but surely, people began to forget about her existence.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' So... this is the path the sages have chosen?
:'''(Traveler):''' (Even now, they still refuse to acknowledge Lesser Lord Kusanali...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (...I never imagined a god could be subjected to such cruelty.)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Alright, let's try to keep our cool. If everyone's in a bad mood, then let's change up our scenery.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Rahman, give me a few men to help us escort the Village Keepers back to the village. And these two scholars &mdash; they're coming too.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 6 rahman 05.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Sure, as you wish.
----
;(Enter the village chief's house)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 candace 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' The Village Keepers you found have all been returned to their homes, and each one has a dedicated caregiver to look after them. The two new scholars are being kept under close supervision, too. Really great work, everyone.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... the atmosphere's so heavy...
:'''(Traveler):''' (It's hard to not feel weighed down by what we just learned.)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Despite everything Lesser Lord Kusanali has done for her people, the Akademiya has abandoned her in the Sanctuary of Surasthana like a lost cause...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Even those she's protected have never realized there's such a small and childlike god in the world.)
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, say something! Stop spacing out!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' C'mon, is there... nothing left to talk about? In that case, let's all get some water and try to think about something else.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 candace 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Or, I can go fetch some snacks...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon's so coming with you!
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Do you have any plans, Traveler?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Gods above, you're not talking about work, are you...
:{{DIcon}} I want to share everything I know with all of you.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Hm, so you were still witholding some information?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I'm sorry. I had my reasons...
:{{DIcon}} But now I know we're all in this together.

:'''In between the conversations, Candace and Paimon bring over snacks and tea.'''

:'''Dehya's expression is relaxed, as if her mood hasn't been affected by the heavy conversation at all.'''

:'''Cyno has a firm and solemn expression on his face. It looks like he's made up his mind about something.<br />The core of his beliefs, his motivation to pursue the right course of action... everything is now clear to him.'''

:'''Alhaitham also turns towards the crowd. He wants to listen, too.'''

:'''...After that, the whole story comes out.<br />All the experiences, feelings, and secrets are shared freely with everyone.<br />To share everything means to consider everyone as allies. From today on, everyone will fight for the same goal.'''

:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even though we lived through all of this firsthand, it still feels super surreal to hear you talk about it again.
:{{DIcon}} ...That's everything we've experienced so far in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' What a whirlwind of a story! I felt like I was holding my breath the whole time.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...It seems like there will be more issues to face in the days ahead than I had anticipated.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Still, now's a good time to make our next move. Now that Rahman's joined us, we'll be an even stronger team.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's time to make a plan.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Indeed. These events are a flagrant transgression of the rules in every sense. We cannot allow it to continue.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 candace 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' So, everyone, are we on the same page?
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Crush the sages, and rescue our god... that is our ultimate goal.
:{{DIcon}} No matter what lies ahead...
:{{DIcon}} I will do my utmost.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Well, let's brainstorm a little more about what other resources we can draw on.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' The next time we gather here, we must have a solid plan.
:{{A|vo xmaq106 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! It'll work out for sure!
:;(Quest ends)
----
;(Talk to Alhaitham, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Don't rush. This is a big undertaking, and the planning and preparation for what lies ahead will no doubt take some time.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Take it slowly. We need to make sure the plan is as effective as possible.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's starting to read his book again! Hey! Are you even listening?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Would you like me to lend you something to read?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No way! Your books aren't quite to Paimon's taste...
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I was joking. I know my books are far too difficult for you, and I have no intention of lending them out.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh! You're so annoying...

;(Talk to Candace, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 candace 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' You must let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 candace 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Though I cannot leave Aaru Village, I can't help but feel... stirred when I see the looks in your eyes.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 candace 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' I've never felt as roused as this when fighting alone in the past...
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 candace 04.ogg}} '''Candace:''' I suppose this must be the power of camaraderie.

;(Talk to Cyno, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...In the past, I never imagined that even the gods could suffer from hardship.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If we can find a way to change all of this... will this nation become a better place?

;(Talk to Dehya, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' The past few days have been some of the most challenging work I've ever taken on.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' And none of it will earn me a single Mora... I can't believe it...
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look on the bright side, Dehya! Maybe we'll get a huuuge reward after this is all over!
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hmm, you've got a point. Hey, what would you do if you woke up tomorrow with more money than you could ever spend?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon would buy boatloads of tasty snacks!
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' That's it?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... and maybe some tasty drinks as well?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hahaha, how adorable.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Well, here's to all our indulgent fantasies... If there's a chance they can come true, I'll give it my best shot.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq107 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' And here's hoping that everything we do from now on will change this world for the better.
