:{{A|vo card dehya ingame easy 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Clever move...

;(When the player defeats two of Dehya Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card dehya ingame easy 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Seems things are heating up...

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card dehya invite easy 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' That was quite the game. You're not half bad... Who knows, a little more practice and you might be able to beat me.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card dehya invite easy 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I lost fair and square. Never thought you'd be even better than those old mercs I usually play against. Didn't see it coming at all.

===Serious Showdown===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Dehya)
:{{A|vo card dehya invite hard 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Sure, I'll play... but I don't have anything valuable to bet with today. Guess it'll have to be a low-stakes game.

;(If the player loses the match):
:{{A|vo card dehya endofgame win 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hahaha, don't let it get to ya. I almost never lose when I'm playing with the mercs in my brigade. Hardly any of 'em can ever beat me.

:{{A|vo card dehya endofgame fail 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Seems my luck ran out today... Hmm, maybe I used it up winning all that money off the others in the brigade?
