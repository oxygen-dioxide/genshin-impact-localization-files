===Tutorial===
;Survey
{| class="tdt1 tdt2" cellspacing="5"
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Survey 1.png|200px]]
| Equip and use Ayesha's Chaos Prospector in designated areas to search for survey targets. You can place up to 3 Ayesha's Chaos Prospectors at once. If you place a fourth, the first survey device you placed will be automatically retrieved.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Survey 2.png|200px]]
| After usage, an Ayesha's Chaos Prospector will be placed in front of you and will automatically survey an area in a specific radius around itself. If it discovers any survey targets within this AoE, it will mark their locations.<br>If the survey target is not within the Prospector's AoE, it will mark the general area of the target for you.
|}
;Sampling
{| class="tdt1 tdt2" cellspacing="5"
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Sampling 1.png|200px]]
| When the challenge starts, you will have to use Electro attacks to activate [[Pursina's Spike]]s and continue charging them.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Sampling 2.png|200px]]
| Activated Pursina's Spikes will convert Electro energy into motive force to recharge itself.<br>The recharge rate of Pursina's Spikes is dependent on the levels of Electro energy provided. When the Electro energy provided is low, its recharge rate will be slowed. If its Electro levels drop to their lowest point, the Spikes will stop charging altogether.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Sampling 3.png|200px]]
| Before an activated Pursina's Spike is fully charged, it will attract nearby opponents to come and attack it.<br>Defeat these opponents to prevent the Pursina's Spikes' integrity from dropping. If one Spike's integrity drops fully, the challenge will fail.
|}
;Anomalous Model Ruin Grader
{| class="tdt1 tdt2" cellspacing="5"
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Anomalous Model Ruin Grader 1.png|200px]]
| Charge all the Pursina's Spikes within the time limit to cut the Anomalous Model Ruin Grader off from its power source and finally defeat it.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Anomalous Model Ruin Grader 2.png|200px]]
| The Pursina's Spikes will affect the operation of the Anomalous Model Ruin Grader and trigger counterattacks while they are charging.<br>When 2 Pursina's Spikes have been activated, the Anomalous Model Ruin Grader will gain an ATK Bonus. When 3 Pursina's Spikes are activated, the Anomalous Model Ruin Grader will gain an additional DEF Bonus.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Anomalous Model Ruin Grader 3.png|200px]]
| Once activated, the Anomalous Model Ruin Grader will start attacking the Pursina's Spikes. At this time, its head- and leg-mounted cores will be exposed. Attack them to stop the Ruin Grader's movements.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Anomalous Model Ruin Grader 4.png|200px]]
| Once it has taken a certain amount of damage or has been in operation for some time, the Anomalous Model Ruin Grader will enter a recharging state where it will attempt to absorb Electro energy from the Pursina's Spikes to enhance itself. Once it has finished this self-enhancement, the Anomalous Model will change targets and start attacking you...
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Anomalous Model Ruin Grader 5.png|200px]]
| While enhanced, the Anomalous Model will not be paralyzed when its weak points are struck. Moreover, the Anomalous Model's attacks can alert nearby opponents. These opponents will be attracted by the Pursina's Spikes as they approach and will begin to attack them.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Anomalous Model Ruin Grader 6.png|200px]]
| If you have not cut off the Anomalous Model Ruin Grader's power source, defeating it will trigger its self-repair mechanism, which will cause it to re-enter an active state.
