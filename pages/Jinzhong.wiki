{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jinzhong:''' Greetings. Something to report to the Millelith? You've come to the right person.
:'''Jinzhong:''' You may proceed.
:{{DIcon}} Who're you?
::'''Jinzhong:''' Me?
::'''Jinzhong:''' Jinzhong, at your service! I represent the Millelith here at [[Yujing Terrace]].
::'''Jinzhong:''' If there's a situation, please report it immediately. The residents of Yujing Terrace are high-profile individuals. Ensuring their safety and well-being is my top priority.
:{{DIcon}} You live at Yujing Terrace?
::'''Jinzhong:''' Not exactly. My home is [[Chihu Rock]], where my parents are from. Both are fishing folk.
::'''Jinzhong:''' However, I am now stationed at Yujing Terrace with the Millelith. As such, I am now a member of the upper echelons of society. I mean, I spend all my working hours here, don't I?
::'''Jinzhong:''' I may be a Millelith guard for now, but it's a start. No doubt it will be too long before I put down roots at Yujing Terrace.
::'''Jinzhong:''' Doing so will make me a permanent member of high society.
::'''Jinzhong:''' Don't worry &mdash; I won't forget you when I make i to the top! You need anything, you just let me know, alright?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Jinzhong:''' While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
::'''Jinzhong:''' Don't forget &mdash; when something important comes up, report to Jinzhong.
