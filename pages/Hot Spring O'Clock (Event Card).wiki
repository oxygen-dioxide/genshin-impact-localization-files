==Story==
{{Description|A pizza made using Grainfruit. Grainfruit is scattered across the crust before a thick layer of cheese is poured on top, and the whole thing is delivered into the oven. The final touch is to then draw a little Koholasaurus picture on it. Eat it while it's hot &mdash; the warmth will remind you of a serene time spent enjoying a soothing soak in a hot spring.|title=Hot Spring O'Clock}}
