==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Honorine:''' Ah, I'd love to bet on that! Otherwise, I'd be letting myself down.
:{{DIcon}} You are...?
::'''Honorine:''' Call me Honorine, an unlucky Fontainian engineer. The [[aquabus]] project I was involved in was halted due to an accident, leaving me... "stranded," you could say.
::'''Honorine:''' If you come across an engineer named [[Hautemontagne]], do say hello to her for me.
:{{DIcon}} Bet on what?
::'''Honorine:''' My salary and safety, of course! I'd love to hire an [[Eremite]] band to escort me into the desert... but it feels like a terrible risk no matter which way I slice it!
::{{DIcon}} To the desert?
:::'''Honorine:''' A certified engineer such as myself, repairing little [[Clockwork Meka|clockwork meka]] day in, day out. What kind of sense does that make?
:::'''Honorine:''' The moment I think upon those magnificent [[Khaenri'ah|Khaenri'ahn]] machines, my heart flies upon those thoughts into the depths of the desert...
:::'''Honorine:''' My regression is unbearable, but the progress of my colleagues by contrast burns my heart all the more! Ah, Hautemontagne's research in [[Liyue]] is progressing in leaps and bounds, surely!
:::'''Honorine:''' Ahh! I must, I must go into the desert!
::{{DIcon}} Risky, you say?
:::'''Honorine:''' Of course! This is the Eremites we speak of, you know! You're an adventurer. I'm sure you've met many a fool nabbed by Eremite bands!
:::'''Honorine:''' I do so dearly wish to visit the desert and witness Khaenri'ahn machines for myself, but I have no desire to become such a laughingstock!
:::'''Honorine:''' In fact, I would land myself in even hotter waters were I to accidentally hire an outlaw.
:::'''Honorine:''' Ugh, how shall I get to the desert...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Honorine:''' See you. Ah, I should just take the gamble...
