|description    = A wooden seat renowned for its water-blue soft cushion and intricate floral-patterned backrest, offering an exceptional seating experience, commonly seen in places like the "Golden Dusk," used to welcome visiting guests. It is said that to enhance the vacation experience, a leader of the [["People of the Springs"]] sought out a master craftsman from the [["Children of Echoes"]] to create a chair that would provide supreme comfort. "When one thinks of the 'People of the Springs,' the sea comes to mind; and when thinking of the sea, one inevitably will think of sapphires!" &mdash;Thus, the master craftsman proposed the idea of inlaying a massive sapphire into the seat. Naturally, such an expensive solution was impractical for the "People of the Springs." Ultimately, they chose a more reasonable option &mdash; opting for a thick and comfortable water-blue cushion as a substitute for the sapphire.
