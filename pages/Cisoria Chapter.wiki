===Act I - When They Talk About Tonight===
{{Main|When They Talk About Tonight}}
{{Description|Plain or ostentatious? Traditional or avant-garde? Stick to the rules, or pursue freedom? These are the questions that designers often ask, and the answers lie within their works.<br>But the owner of Chioriya Boutique, "The Thundering Seamstress," is difficult to read. As the edges of her incisive blades dance to and fro across the fabric, it seems as though there was never such a choice at all, or perhaps there was only ever one choice for her — the one she likes.}}
