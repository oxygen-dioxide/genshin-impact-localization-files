==Trivia==
* Constellation Metropole contains various references to {{w|FromSoftware}}'s ''{{w|Elden Ring}}''.
** In the original Chinese text, the two [[Mitachurl]]s encountered when entering the tower are named {{Zh|大斧守卫|lit=Greataxe Guard}}, a reference to the double {{lang|[https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tree+Sentinel#altus-plateau Tree Sentinel]|zh=大树守卫|zh_lit=Great Tree Guard}} boss fight. The two Tree Sentinels guard the Royal Capital of Leyndell, which the Constellation Metropole itself may be inspired by.
** In the original Chinese text, a [[Stonehide Lawachurl]] encountered in the middle floor of the tower is named {{Zh|「碎木将军」丘丘岩盔王|lit='General of Shattered Wood' Stonehide Lawachurl}}, a reference to {{lang|[https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Starscourge+Radahn Starscourge Radahn]|zh=「碎星将军」拉塔恩|zh_lit='General of Shattered Stars' Radahn}}.
** The placement of 5 [[Exploding Barrel]]s at the entrance of the tower references a similar arrangement of explosive barrels found near one of the entry points of [https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormveil+Castle Stormveil Castle].
** The tower features specific doors that can only be opened from one side. When they are interacted with from the locked side, the prompt "It can't be opened from this side" appears, mirroring a common design element in ''Elden Ring''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s dungeons.
** In one room, a single, out-of-place apple can be found on the floor. Picking up the apple triggers a group of Hilichurls to spawn, a nod to ''Elden Ring''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tactic of using items of low value to lure players into ambushes.
