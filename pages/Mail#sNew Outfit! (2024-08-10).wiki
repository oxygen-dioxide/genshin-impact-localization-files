|text      = A few days ago when I was on duty, I happened to assist a caravan from [[Fontaine]] and chatted with everyone for quite some time. I heard that people there go to see operas together wearing beautiful garments that are specially tailored. No wonder it's the capital of fashion and the arts!

I plan to make a new outfit for [[Baron Bunny]] using the popular fabrics from Fontaine this time, so he can attend my birthday in style! Haha, once Baron Bunny is in his new Fontaine-style outfit, should his dance moves change accordingly too?

Oh, and you've been to Fontaine, so you must have some unique insights on the topic of "fashion"! I'd love to hear your thoughts on the outfit as well.

Please, take the chance and come to [[Mondstadt]] to see your old friends' new looks!
