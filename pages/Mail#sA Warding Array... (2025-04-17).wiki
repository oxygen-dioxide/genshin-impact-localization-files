Of course, I harbor no doubts about your martial ability, but if you rely solely on your skills and keep throwing yourself into harm's way, none can guarantee your safe return every time.

There are still many people in this world who care about you...

On second thought, persuasion isn't my forte.

Just take this instead. It's a turquoise I infused with [[Adeptus|adeptal]] energies. I trust it will keep you safe.
