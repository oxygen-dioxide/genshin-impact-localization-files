* Event Shop Duration: 2022/09/02 10:00 - 2022/09/19 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above

===Summary===
* During the event, partner with the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] to seek out treasure that can be exchanged in the Event Shop for one of the commemorative event gadgets: "[[Mini Seelie: Moss]]," "[[Mini Seelie: Viola]]," "[[Mini Seelie: Dayflower]]," "[[Mini Seelie: Rosé]]," and "[[Mini Seelie: Curcuma]]"! Rewards such as [[Primogem]]s, [[Talent Level-Up Materials]], [[Weapon Ascension Materials]], [[Hero's Wit]], [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]], and [[Mora]] can also be obtained!
* During the event, check the treasure map within Ulman's Treasure Book. Follow the map to reach the area where the treasure is buried. Ulman will mark out one new area in this book each day, for a total of 6 treasure areas.
* Help the "Treasure-Seeking Seelie" absorb energy in various ways in the treasure area to help it restore vitality. For every 3 instances of elemental energy obtained, the "Treasure-Seeking Seelie" will indicate the whereabouts of the treasure once.
* Dig in a treasure area to find the treasure chest and claim rewards and the "Ancient Iron Coins" within.
* During the event, you can exchange "Ancient Iron Coins" for materials in the event shop. After the Event Shop closes, your remaining "Ancient Iron Coins" will disappear.
* Upon completing Area 6, the Event Shop will open for the redemption of "Mini Seelie: Moss," "Mini Seelie: Viola," "Mini Seelie: Dayflower," "Mini Seelie: Rosé," and "Mini Seelie: Curcuma." During this event, Travelers may only exchange for one type, after which the remaining four will no longer be available. Each Mini Seelie can only be obtained once.

|text1  = Check the treasure map within [[Ulman]]'s Treasure Book. Follow the map to reach the area where the treasure is buried.<br />Ulman will mark out 1 new area in this book each day, for a total of 6 treasure areas.
|image2 = Tutorial Lost Riches 2022-09-02 2.png
|text2  = If you equip the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] from your [[Inventory]], you can summon it when in a treasure area. However, if you are not in a treasure area, the Treasure-Seeking Seelie will not answer your summons.
|image3 = Tutorial Lost Riches 2022-09-02 3.png
|text3  = After you equip and summon the Treasure-Seeking Seelie, the minimap will mark the location of energy emissions. Go to these areas and help the Treasure-Seeking Seelie collect energy to revitalize it.<br />The Treasure-Seeking Seelie will be able to find one treasure area if it collects energy 3 times.
|image4 = Tutorial Lost Riches 2022-09-02 4.png
|text4  = When you begin looking for treasure in a Treasure Area, the Seelie will seek the treasure out within a certain radius.<br />You must help the Treasure-Seeking Seelie collect energy and keep its energy levels up. Helping the Seelie to completely regenerate its energy within a certain amount of time will allow it to start searching for treasure.
