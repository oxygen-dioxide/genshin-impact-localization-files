'''Cooking''' is a [[Crafting Method]] players can use to create [[Food]] and [[Processing|process]] [[Cooking Ingredient|ingredients]] at stoves.

Cooking can be done at stoves located in cities like [[City of Mondstadt|Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue Harbor]], at campfires found in the open world, in the [[Serenitea Pot]] with [[:Category:Cooking Furnishings|cooking furnishings]], and with the one-use [[forged]] gadget [[Adepti Seeker's Stove]]. Campfires and stoves that are put out must be lit by [[Pyro]] in order to cook. [[Anemo]], [[Cryo]], [[Electro]], [[Geo]] and [[Hydro]] effects, including [[Weather#Rain|rainy]] [[weather]], (due to [[Swirl]], [[Melt]], [[Overloaded]], [[Crystallize]] and [[Vaporize]], respectively) can extinguish both campfires and stoves, preventing cooking.

Some characters have special passive [[Talents]] that give them a chance to double the output received when they are the character selected and perform a perfect cook. Characters also have a specific character linked special dish they have a 25/20/15% chance to obtain depending on the rarity of the food (1/2/3 star respectively) while cooking a specific dish when they are the character selected.

The [[Raiden Shogun]] is the only character that is unable to cook.

==Manual Cooking==
[[File:Manual Cooking.png|200px|thumb|Manual cooking]]
When a player first learns a new dish, they must become proficient in making that dish by manually cooking it perfectly a certain amount of times before being able to auto cook it. Manually cooking requires the player to stop the cooking timer when the indicator is in the correct position.

[[File:Food Quality.png|200px|thumb|Different Food Qualities]]
The location the indicator is stopped at affects the potency of the dish cooked:
* The orange section will result in a Delicious Dish that gives the maximum food effect, and increases proficiency.
* The yellow section will result in a Regular Dish that gives an average effect.
* The gray section will result in a Suspicious Dish that gives the lowest possible food effect.

You can exit out of this minigame to avoid using the ingredients if you do not wish to cook.

==Proficiency==
Each food item has its own proficiency, once an item is cooked perfectly enough times the proficiency will max out and you will be able to auto cook. Auto bulk cooking cannot be cancelled and will always result in either the Delicious version of that item and also has the usual chance rolled individually multiple times for doubled output and special dishes if the correct character is used.

The max number of dishes that can be auto-cooked at the same time is 99 (to cook more, the auto-cook function will have to be used more than once).

Starting in [[Version 1.4]], players can switch back to manual cooking even after the proficiency is maxed out. This allows players to access dialogue and achievements that require Suspicious and normal dishes even if players have only cooked perfectly and already maxed out dishes' proficiencies.

The max proficiency for each dish depends on the rarity of the dish being made:

==Special Dishes==
[[File:Cooking_Character_Select.png|200px|thumb|A character able to cook a special dish]]
While cooking, the character selection screen may be opened to select a character that can make a special dish.

Characters' special dishes are of an even higher quality than Delicious dishes, giving even higher bonuses/stats when eaten, making them desirable.

Special dishes have a low chance of being made through both automatic and manual cooking. This chance also applies to Normal and even Suspicious variants of the recipe. Thus, it is possible to get Special Dishes even when failing manual cooking.
