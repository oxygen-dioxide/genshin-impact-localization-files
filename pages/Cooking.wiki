'''Cooking''' is a [[Crafting Method]] players can use to create [[Food]] and [[Processing|process]] [[Cooking Ingredient|ingredients]] at stoves.

In line with [[Ei]]'s admission that she has no cooking skills,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|Ei's Troubles|quote='''Ei:''' Don't try and get me to cook. I can take care of anything else, but not that.}}</ref> if the player attempts to select [[Raiden Shogun]], they will get the error message "This character cannot cook."

==Manual Cooking==
[[File:Manual Cooking.png|200px|thumb|Manual cooking]]
When a player first learns a new dish, they must become proficient in making that dish by manually cooking it perfectly a certain amount of times before being able to auto cook it. Manually cooking requires the player to stop the cooking timer when the indicator is in the correct position.

[[File:Food Quality.png|200px|thumb|Different Food Qualities]]
The location the indicator is stopped at affects the potency of the dish cooked:
* The orange section will result in a Delicious Dish that gives the maximum food effect, and increases proficiency.
* The yellow section will result in a Regular Dish that gives an average effect.
* The gray section will result in a Suspicious Dish that gives the lowest possible food effect.

If the player exits the minigame, ingredients will not be consumed.

==Proficiency==
Each food item has its own proficiency. Once an item is cooked perfectly enough times, proficiency will max out and Auto Cook will be unlocked for that dish, which allows up to 99 of a single type of food to be cooked at once. Auto Cook cannot be cancelled and will always produce a Delicious version of that item.

Manual cooking will still remain available even if proficiency is maxed out.

The max proficiency for each dish depends on the quality of the dish being made:

==Places to Cook==
The [[Main City]] of each region typically has an outdoor cooking stove very close to a food vendor.

Campfires with a cooking pot are normally found in the wilderness outside of major cities, allowing for players to cook as they explore. Campfires and stoves that are put out must be lit by {{Pyro}} in order to cook. {{Anemo}}/{{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}/{{Geo}}/{{Hydro}} can extinguish campfires and stoves, preventing cooking.

Players can also cook using a consumable cooking gadget, {{Item|Adepti Seeker's Stove}}, which can be [[Forging|forged]].

The [[Serenitea Pot]] can also host a few cooking furnishings:

}}

==Special Dishes==
{{Main|Special Dish}}
Dishes, when cooked, have a certain chance to be made as a [[Special Dish]] variant depending on the quality of the food when cooked with the relevant character. These special dishes provide either a higher bonus or additional effect over their Delicious variant, as well as a separate icon, name and description.

==Character Bonuses==
Certain characters have [[Talents]] that provides a bonus while cooking dishes of certain function.
