{{Dialogue Start}}
;(When all of Azariq's Character Cards are at 4 HP or below)
:'''Azariq:''' Well...
:'''Liloupar:''' Oh, fret not, desert-dweller, it is laudable that a mind like yours has sustained you up till now.
:'''Azariq:''' ...Is this your way of conveying approval?

;(When the player defeats one of Azariq's Character Cards)
:'''Jeht:''' Haha, good work! Looks like someone's about to lose!
:'''Azariq:''' What are you talking about? I'm not even close to losing!
:'''Liloupar:''' Heh, fools often refuse to admit failure even when the signs are clear to see.

;(When Azariq defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:'''Azariq:''' I won! Haha, guess you're not that good at this game.
:'''Jeht:''' Azariq, you didn't just cheat, did you?
:'''Azariq:''' Hey, c'mon! The cards are all on the table. How could I have pulled any tricks?

;(When Azariq uses an Elemental Burst)
:'''Azariq:''' Finally, it's my turn! Haha!
:'''Jeht:''' Hmph...
:'''Azariq:''' Hey, little wildcat, you think I didn't see that? Show me the hidden cards...
