|description = A claw-snapping crab that can be found in various water bodies throughout [[Teyvat]].<br>This golden-shelled crab is especially tasty, and is the star of the show in the famed [[Liyue]] dish known as [[Golden Crab]].<br>Some people call those who run amok as they please "crabs," but a crab's manner of movement is not so much as matter of their character as it is their physical makeup. Such monikers are most unfair to crab-kind.
