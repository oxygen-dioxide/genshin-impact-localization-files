==List of Quests==
# [[Chisato's Letter]]

==Summary==
After arriving in Inazuma, the Traveler finds themself unable to leave [[Ritou]] Island due to the [[Sakoku Decree]] enforced by the [[Kanjou Commission]]. In order to leave, the Traveler must obtain a permit. The Traveler attempts to talk to [[Hiiragi Shinsuke]], the Kanjou Commissioner, who seems friendly but clearly has no intention of letting the Traveler leave the island. Therefore, the Traveler ends up secretly striking a deal with [[Hiiragi Chisato]], the commissioner's daughter, to deliver a letter to her lover, [[Kujou Kamaji]] of the [[Tenryou Commission]]. Since she cannot deliver the letter herself due to her clan's strict rules, Chisato helps the traveler sneak out of the island in order to deliver this letter in exchange for her telling Kujou Kamaji to write a permit for the Traveler. After successfully sneaking out of the Ritou, the Traveler delivers the letter to Kujou Kamaji who gives the Traveler a permit and his own letter which the Traveler delivers back to Hiiragi Chisato.
