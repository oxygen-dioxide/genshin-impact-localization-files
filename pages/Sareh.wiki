:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Sareh:''' Many of the guests who come here play Genius Invokation TCG, and of course I learned a lot from that.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Sareh:''' ...When you encounter a stronger player, losing is a foregone conclusion.
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Sareh:''' This inn was opened by my [[Shapur|father]], and I am the hostess.
::'''Sareh:''' If you would like to stay here, please register your name, number of guests, reason for your stay, and number of days you'll be staying.
::'''Sareh:''' Oh, of course. If you don't want to leave your information, that's fine too. The registration is just for us to provide you with better service.
::'''Sareh:''' By the way, you can use the elevator in front of the inn whether you're a guest or not, so you don't have to climb up the long incline.
::'''Sareh:''' But if you're afraid of heights, there's nothing we can do...
::'''Sareh:''' Oh yes, did you see a researcher with messy hair and dirty clothes on the way here?
::{{DIcon}} No, I didn't...
::'''Sareh:''' Hmm... Okay. He might have left Port Ormos.
::'''Sareh:''' His name is [[Amandeep]] and he's a researcher who's lived here for a very long time. He makes a living by mentoring young researchers writing papers.
::'''Sareh:''' A few days ago, I think it was the day the sea monsters were out and about, he went out and didn't come back. Without settling his bill with us.
::'''Sareh:''' I'm not looking for him to settle his bill though. I'm just worried that he is in some sort of trouble because he just disappeared so suddenly.
::'''Sareh:''' I've asked everyone in Port Ormos to help look for him but to no avail.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sareh:''' See you.
