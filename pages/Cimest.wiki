:'''Saborn:''' Both you and that paper frog were acknowledged as Guardians, Your Highness!?
:'''Souffache:''' Unbelievable, unheard of! There is simply no precedent for this!
:'''Saborn:''' And you'll have to make changes to the trial too... No, don't do this, Your Highness!
:'''Souffache:''' You can't simply overhaul such an ancient tradition on a whim, Your Highness!
:'''Cimest:''' Alright, alright, keep your voices down. My ears are starting to hurt...
:'''Cimest:''' It's all been decided already. Now, given that I am both a princess and a Guardian who has been acknowledged by the relic, you're in even less of a position to stop me.
:'''Saborn:''' But, Your Highness...
:'''Cimest:''' The both of you may relax. I'll host a ceremony to train up hosts of reliable flying squirrels to defend the kingdom.
:'''Cimest:''' Only after that will I leave the kingdom.
:'''Souffache:''' Your Highness, we... *sigh* You...
:'''Cimest:''' Don't worry, you two. I can take care of myself.
:'''Cimest:''' As the princess, in the end it is I who shall face the wild winds of the world on my own.
:'''Saborn:''' ...As you wish, Your Highness.
