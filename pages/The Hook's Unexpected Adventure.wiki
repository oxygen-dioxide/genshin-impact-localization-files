{{Quest Description|Kayvan and Helbet are busy trying to do something...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Helbet)
:'''Helbet:''' (Mr. Kayvan is actually... quite impressive...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Kayvan)
:'''Kayvan:''' (I... I'll definitely catch a big fish...)

;(Talk to Kayvan or Helbet)
:'''Helbet:''' Please try the new bait again, Mr. Kayvan.
:'''Kayvan:''' I've done that so many times, but the results are just the same as before!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why are the two of you fishing together again?
:'''Kayvan:''' Traveler, we meet again.
:'''Helbet:''' Hello, you two.
:{{DIcon}} Have you found out why the fish refuse to take the bait?
:{{DIcon}} Did you learn anything from the researchers?
:'''Kayvan:''' Haha! Nope. A researcher and I tried methods like modifying the fishing rod, adjusting the bait, and improving our techniques.
:'''Kayvan:''' We tried so many bodies of water and angles... I even tried fishing in a pond full of fish.
:'''Kayvan:''' But no matter what I did, I could only fish up things that aren't fish.
:'''Helbet:''' Don't worry, Mr. Kayvan. Didn't that researcher promise to keep researching? He'll definitely determine the reason behind all this for us.
:'''Helbet:''' See, he even designed a new bait for you, and he wants me to stay here with you and record every detail of your fishing process down...
:'''Kayvan:''' I hope he really succeeds... But until then, I'll just keep fishing my way.
:'''Kayvan:''' If you would, Traveler, could you get me some more material for bait?
:{{DIcon}} What sort of materials do you need this time?

:'''Kayvan:''' There's a place with pretty good Sweet Flowers. I'll mark it out on your map...

;(Talk to Kayvan again)
:'''Kayvan:''' I'm feeling pretty good today. It probably won't take long to catch something once I get the materials and make some bait.

;(Talk to Helbet again)
:'''Helbet:''' I hope you'll be able to catch a fish today...
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Paimon:''' There are so many monsters here...

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kayvan:''' Not bad. Now, it's time to fish. I'm gonna catch a big one this time!
:{{Black Screen|Kayvan prepares the bait and begins fishing...}}
:{{Black Screen|Kayvan catches a wet package a short while later...}}
:'''Helbet:''' Uh... Let me have a look...
:'''Helbet:''' Huh? The things in here... They seem like lost items again...
:{{DIcon}} As expected of you.
:{{DIcon}} "Again"?
:'''Helbet:''' Uh... We've been fishing ever since Mr. Kayvan and I went to that researcher to modify our bait...
:'''Helbet:''' But Mr. Kayvan still fishes up strange things every single time.
:'''Helbet:''' Including lost items, ore from the bottom of the river, packages that fell off ships...
:'''Helbet:''' Even some adventurer who accidentally fell into the water once grabbed onto Mr. Kayvan's fishing line to get out of the water...
:'''Helbet:''' But we just can't catch any fish...
:'''Kayvan:''' My fishing career has come to its end...
:'''Helbet:''' M&mdash;Mr. Kayvan! Cheer up! L&mdash;Look, the owner of this thing is definitely anxious.
:'''Helbet:''' He'll definitely be overjoyed that you fished it up.
:'''Helbet:''' We may even be compensated when we take these lost items back to the Adventurers' Guild!
:'''Kayvan:''' But... I really! I really just want&mdash;
:'''Kayvan:''' I really just want to catch a fish!
