'''Experimental Drink No. 5''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtainable from the {{Quest|Time to Drink}}.

==How to Obtain==
Experimental Drink No. 5 can be obtained from ''Time to Drink'' by choosing the following dialogue options in the respective encounters in the {{Quest|Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!}}:
* First Encounter: "Uh, let's leave the sweet flavor be, shall we?"
