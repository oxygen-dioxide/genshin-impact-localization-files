|description     = A signature chicken dish of Sumeru.
|desc_suspicious = Baked in high heat, the chicken has become dry and wooden. The overabundance of seasonings has covered the original scent of the ingredients. Even someone who likes jerky will need a bottle of water to help swallow the meat.
|desc_basic      = The chicken was first marinated with red spices, and then roasted in a tandoor. The process of making this Sumeru classic does not involve any fancy skills, and the use of such a humble clay oven might be surprising to some. In Sumeru, a tandoor to a veteran chef is as important as a trusty sword to an adventurer.
|desc_delicious  = The vibrant flames have locked the umami inside the chicken’s reddened skin. Once it slips into your mouth, the rich flavor will awaken your every taste bud. The chicken and spices seem to have performed a mysterious Sumeru dance on the tip of your tongue, evoking the image of a festive banquet…
