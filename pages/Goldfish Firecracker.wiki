'''Goldfish Firecracker''' is [[Yoimiya]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Yoimiya's hair is tied into a high ponytail that messily sticks out in all angles. She wears many festival themed hair accessories.

Yoimiya's attire mainly consists of a short orange-red kimono with only one sleeve worn. Her right sleeve is rolled up past her elbow and tied with a string. The left half of the kimono is draped around her waist. Her chest is wrapped up in sarashi, as are her left forearm and upper thighs, extending down to her right leg. A festival pouch hangs from her waist on the left, and her Vision is secured to her obi on her right.
