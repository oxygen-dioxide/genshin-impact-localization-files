|description = A reptile with a thick shell.<br>Like their counterparts all across [[Teyvat]], they have a gentle nature and move slowly. Maybe they are even too gentle and slow to notice that mountain rocks have begun to accumulate on their shells in [[Geo]]-rich areas.<br>Legend has it that in the distant past, the early residents of Chenyu Vale saw a giant turtle that was more majestic than the mountains combined, which they named the Gui. The authenticity of such tales cannot be verified, but the modern Jadestone Turtles can still grow into spectacular giants.<br>Sometimes, however, the Geo accumulated on their shells causes them an unbearable itch. If someone could kindly clean their shells and remove the calcified jade, they would surely be pleased...
