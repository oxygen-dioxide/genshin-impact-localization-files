==Text==
&mdash;Modest Fortune&mdash;<br>
A gust of wind suddenly whistles through the clear skies. What might this mean?<br>
Though you may feel like you're just spinning your wheels, this is only temporary.<br>
Look out for those who appear around you, familiar though those faces may be.<br>
Who knows? Your fate may be changed by their presence without your knowledge...

Your lucky object for the day: A dandelion from a faraway land.<br>
Seeds that follow the wind are a most fitting symbol for you.<br>
Fly, drift, across the seas, to lands far away.<br>
But one day, you will no longer drift.<br>
One day, you will become what you hope to be.
