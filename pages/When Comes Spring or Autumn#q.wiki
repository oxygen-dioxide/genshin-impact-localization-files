'''''When Comes Spring or Autumn?''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to complete {{Quest|Silently the Butterfly Crosses the Valley}}.

== Trivia ==

* The achievement's name is a reference to a story from {{W|Zhuangzi}}, one of the two foundational books of Taoism: 上古有大椿者，以八千岁为春，以八千岁为秋。 (''In time of old, there was a great tree called Dachun; It sees 8,000 years as just one spring, and 8,000 years as just one autumn''). This phrase describes how long-living beings perceive time: a period that is eternity for the mortal (in ancient China, number 8 was considered "a lot" or "uncountable"), yet only equals a fleeting moment for the immortals.<!--
