{{Quest Description|You and Paimon finally arrive at Sumeru City. Well, will you be able to get an audience with the [[Lesser Lord Kusanali|Dendro Archon]]?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the entrance to Sumeru City)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sumeru City! Ah, we finally made it!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, did you see that? When those people entered the city, something on their heads lit up!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 01.ogg}} '''Panah:''' One moment please, you two. It appears this is your first time visiting Sumeru City.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Yeah, that's right, but how did you know that?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 02.ogg}} '''Panah:''' Because there's currently no information on either of you in the [[Akasha]].
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 03.ogg}} '''Panah:''' But no need to worry, that won't prevent you from entering the city. In fact, the [[Akademiya]] conveniently provides each traveler to Sumeru City with a device.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 04.ogg}} '''Panah:''' Perhaps you two have heard of the Akasha before. It's our beloved [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s lasting legacy, a treasure trove of collected knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 05.ogg}} '''Panah:''' After centuries of tireless research on the Akasha, the Akademiya created one of its most ingenious inventions, the Akasha Terminal.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 06.ogg}} '''Panah:''' As long as you are within Sumeru's borders, you may use an Akasha Terminal to connect directly to the Akasha and access any knowledge you need.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 07.ogg}} '''Panah:''' I should mention that due to technical limitations, the operation of Akasha Terminals will be much smoother and more effective in large cities such as Sumeru City and [[Port Ormos]].
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so this is the thing that [[Tighnari]] was telling us about. It sounds pretty amazing!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 08.ogg}} '''Panah:''' You two are quite fortunate. Until recently, it was standard practice to only issue Akasha Terminals to outlanders who spent an extended amount of time in Sumeru. However, this policy was recently changed, and now all travelers are issued one upon arrival.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 09.ogg}} '''Panah:''' Here are your Akasha Terminals. Please handle them with care.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, it kinda looks like a leaf.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 10.ogg}} '''Panah:''' To activate it, simply hold it in your hand and say the following phrase to yourself: "May the Mighty God bless us with their voice of wisdom."
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, since this little doodad lets you access knowledge, maybe we can use it to find a way to meet Lesser Lord Kusanali. Let's give it a try!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahem! May the Mighty God bless us with their voice of wisdom...
:{{DIcon}} May the Mighty God bless us with their voice of wisdom.
;(The Akasha's leaf symbol appears over the Traveler's left ear)
;(A holographic green pattern briefly appears over the Traveler's and Paimon's faces like an eyemask)
;(The Akasha interface is shown overlaying the normal view)
;(The [[Corps of Thirty]] member with Panah is highlighted, and a card briefly appears with his information in the [[Sumeru Language]])
;(Panah is highlighted, and a card briefly appears with his information in the Sumeru Language)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Just now, something clicked and Paimon suddenly knew how to use this thing! It seems all we need to do is concentrate on what we wanna know... and BAM! You get it! Ohh, that'll come in real handy!
;(The camera resumes normal narrative panning, and the Akasha interface disappears)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 11.ogg}} '''Panah:''' Exactly. That is the power of the Akasha.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 panah 12.ogg}} '''Panah:''' And with that, let me officially welcome you both to Sumeru City. May the wisdom of the Dendro Archon always be your guide.
;(Panah and the Corps of Thirty member with him leave)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, now that we're in, we can check the Akasha about Lesser Lord Kusanali. Let Paimon try...
;(The same pattern from before briefly appears over Paimon's eyes)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Five hundred years ago, the sages found a newly born deity from within some scorched ruins... The deity now resides in the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]]... Hmm, seems pretty similar to what [[Collei]] was telling us.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, next, let's concentrate on asking how to meet her... Huh? Paimon doesn't sense anything... Hmm, the Akasha didn't respond to Paimon's question.
:{{DIcon}} Huh, the same happened to me.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, c'mon! Ugh, focusing on this question feels like when you have something you're trying to remember and it's on the tip of your tongue, but you just can't think of it!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon's brain is exhausted...
:{{DIcon}} I'll try asking the Akasha something else.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe I'll indirectly find more information about Kusanali.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, smart idea! But what are you going to ask it?

:{{DIcon}} Think "Why doesn't the Akasha answer my question?"
::'''(Traveler):''' (A vague thought suddenly comes to mind... The Akasha doesn't unconditionally respond to every query.)
::'''(Traveler):''' (Also, even if the same query is requested by multiple people, the Akasha still imparts knowledge based on each person's identity, age, experiences, and other demographics.)
::{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 16a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, could it be because we're outlanders and we've only just arrived in Sumeru? You know, maybe we're not qualified to receive an answer to this sort of question or something?
:;(Option removed, return to dialogue selection)
:{{DIcon}} Think "Lesser Lord Kusanali."
::'''(Traveler):''' (Some knowledge began to trickle into my mind for a moment, but there wasn't really anything that I didn't already know.)
::{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 16b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, you too? Well, glad it's not just Paimon.
:;(Option removed, return to dialogue selection)
:{{DIcon}} Think "Greater Lord Rukkhadevata."
::'''(Traveler):''' (Many bright dots of light appeared in my mind. I probably need to calm my mind and focus more to understand what they mean.)
::'''(Traveler):''' (Feelings of affection, intimacy, nostalgia, sadness, and anxiety also come to my mind... These seem to be what the people of Sumeru feel about their departed archon.)
::{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 16c.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh oh, Paimon's getting all teary-eyed all of a sudden... It feels like the people of Sumeru really miss their archon.
:;(Option removed, return to dialogue selection)

;(After clearing all three dialogue options)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Well, seems no matter which way we try, we can't find anything that'll lead us to Lesser Lord Kusanali. Hmm, guess our only choice now is to try meeting with the researcher that Tighnari recommended.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's from Sumeru and even has a position in the Akademiya. Maybe he'll be able to access more info from the Akasha.

;(After the dialogue)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see, Tighnari wrote an address on the letter's envelope... Oh, it's not far from the city's gate.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head over and have a look. Hopefully he's at home.
----
;(Approach Rohawi)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello, are you Rohawi?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 01.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Yes, that's me. Can I help you?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! You see, Tighnari sent us here and...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 02.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' What? Tighnari!?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 03.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Ah! Please, th&mdash;there's no need to say anything, really! Sure, I admit that the article I published last month wasn't my best work, and maybe the data didn't produce the most convincing results, but...
:{{DIcon}} Uh, I think you've misunderstood us.
:{{DIcon}} We're not here to discuss academics.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Here, this is a letter from Tighnari.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 04.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Oh, let me see... Ah, whew, what a relief! You two nearly scared the life out of me. So you two just have some questions for me?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 05.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Seems even Tighnari acknowledges my innate ability for procuring information. So, what is it you two would like to know?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We want to meet with Lesser Lord Kusanali. Do you know a way we can do that?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 06.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' You mean you want to meet the Dendro Archon herself? Uh, this isn't exactly my area of expertise, but let me see what I can find in the Akasha...
;(The same pattern from before briefly appears over Rohawi's glasses)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 07.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Hmm, sorry, the Akasha didn't respond to my query.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What, you too!? But what about your abilities for getting information and all that? *sigh* Paimon was sure you'd be able to access more info than we did.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 08.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Well, as I said, this isn't my area of expertise. I am but a lowly researcher, so the Akasha doesn't see a need for me to know more about the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 09.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' All I know is that ever since Lesser Lord Kusanali returned to Sumeru, she's never left the Sanctuary of Surasthana or made a public appearance.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, didn't expect her to be such a mysterious figure.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 10.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' The Dendro Archon is somewhat of a recluse. Perhaps she just doesn't want to entertain visitors, which would explain the lack of information in the Akasha.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, but then what can we do?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 11.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Heh, no need to worry just yet, I'm only hypothesizing here. You could certainly try asking around and see if anyone else has ideas.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 12.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' And besides, you two should consider the bright side of things. Not being able to see Lesser Lord Kusanali may not be a bad thing.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 13.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' In this world, there will always be information you cannot obtain from the Akasha, and things you can never accomplish. Knowing when to yield is a form of wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 14.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Take me, for example. It's a miracle if my brain cells can spit out one paper every three years... But Tighnari, that guy can publish three papers in just a single year.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh, okay, thanks for your advice.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 15.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Don't mention it. If you two ever want information about things like who's been promoted within the Akademiya or relations between The Six Great Sages, come find me.
:{{DIcon}} So by "area of expertise"...
:{{DIcon}} You meant this kind of stuff!?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 16.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Hey c'mon, this is a survival skill at the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Paimon's expectations were pretty low, but this is so low it's like digging holes in the dirt.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what do we do now? Even if we want to talk to someone, we don't know anybody here.
:{{DIcon}} No, there's still one other person we know...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Like who?
:{{DIcon}} Ad astra abyssosque.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you're right! Katheryne! The Adventurers' Guild has its own intel network. Let's hurry and find her.

;(Talk to Rohawi again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq005 rohawi 01.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Anything else you'd like to ask about?
:{{DIcon}} About The Six Great Sages...
::{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 17a.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Sage is the highest rank for an Akademiya researcher. Since the institution's founding, each of [[The Six Great Sages]] represent the finest mind and leader of their respective [[Darshan]].
::{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 17a 1.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' One Grand Sage is chosen from among the six sages to serve as the head of the Akademiya. The current one is Sage [[Azar]] of the [[Rtawahist]] Darshan.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 17a 2.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Since ancient times, the sages have contributed immensely to Sumeru. The widespread usage of the Akasha is thanks to their hard work.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the relationships between the sages.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 17b.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Haha, I just knew you'd be curious about that!
::{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 17b 1.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' Although the Six Darshans conduct research in different disciplines, their sages frequently interact with one another when managing Akademiya affairs.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 17b 2.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' In the [[Amurta]], our leader is Sage [[Naphis]]. His temper is legendary &mdash; we researchers are terrified of him, and even the Grand Sage gives him some leeway.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 17b 3.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' He hasn't shown his face lately, though. Rumor has it that he's currently involved with some major project. Thankfully, he's been so busy that I was able to publish a paper.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 3 rohawi 17c.ogg}} '''Rohawi:''' See ya. Take a page out of my book and learn to look on the bright side of things.
----
;(Approach Katheryne)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Ad astra abyssosque! Hello, Traveler and Paimon.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Katheryne! We need your help with something.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Understood. The Adventurers' Guild is always ready to serve you. With what do you require assistance?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We want to meet with Lesser Lord Kusanali. Do you know a way we can do that?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' You two wish to meet with Sumeru's archon. Understood. Please wait...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' I apologize, but I am unable to call up any relevant information in the Akasha. I'm also unable to locate any pertinent information in my personal memory.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, another dead end. Well, if Katheryne can't help us, then we really don't know anyone else to ask now...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Please do not worry. I may know of someone who can help you two.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 06.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' In Sumeru, the Adventurers' Guild does not serve as the vanguard of information. Rather, there are numerous active mercenary groups, collectively known as [[the Eremites]].
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 07.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' They take on various contracts and work all across Sumeru, so they naturally accrue intelligence.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 08.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' An Eremite brigade called the [[Corps of Thirty]] is in charge of Sumeru City's defenses. Not only are they the oldest brigade, but they are responsible for managing and coordinating the affairs of all other mercenary brigades.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Corps of Thirty]]? What a weird name...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 09.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Supposedly, they are named as such because their ranks numbered thirty at their inception.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 10.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' [[Asfand]], an adviser with the Corps of Thirty, maintains good relations with the Adventurers' Guild. Though he's already retired, he and his words carry great weight within mercenary circles.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 11.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' If you'd like to get in contact with him, you can find him at the Corps of Thirty's headquarters, the [[Citadel of Regzar]].
:{{DIcon}} Thanks a bunch, Katheryne!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 4 katheryne 12.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' You're welcome. I wish you two the best of luck. We look forward to your exploits in Sumeru.

;(After the dialogue)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, off to the Citadel of Regzar we go!
----
;(Approach the Citadel of Regzar)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 01.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Welcome! The Adventurers' Guild told me to expect you two.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's nice to meet you, Asfand! We'd like to ask you about something.
:{{color|menu|You explain your reason for coming here...}}
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 02.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' I see. So Katheryne's the one who sent you this way.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 03.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Heh, it's true that the Eremites' network is vast, but even I can't help you meet the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, seriously? That's it?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 04.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Haha, 'fraid so. The Eremites aren't terribly religious, so we don't know much about divinities. As far as the Akasha goes, we can access even less than you.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 05.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' We originally came from the desert &mdash; the gods there died off long ago. Since those days, we've used our own two hands to carve out a living. We don't beg gods for their aid.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 06.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' It isn't just us, though. If you ask me, I think most in Sumeru aren't interested in Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Why's that?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 07.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Just take the Akademiya for example. They're the ones who truly rule Sumeru. Although they believe in gods, most of 'em only care for the late Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 08.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' In their eyes, she was the one who founded Sumeru and gifted us with the Akasha. Lesser Lord Kusanali just happened to inherit her legacy.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 09.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Because of the Akademiya's influence, most citizens are more familiar with Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and hold her in greater esteem.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 10.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Not to mention that Lesser Lord Kusanali never makes an appearance, and the Akademiya never announces anything about her. As far as the people of Sumeru are concerned, she's just a god that exists... and that's all.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Aw, after hearing all of that, Paimon sorta feels bad for Lesser Lord Kusanali...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 11.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Hah, but who knows? We're all just guessing when it comes down to it. Besides, I'm sure the God of Wisdom doesn't worry about her reputation among people like us.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, well thanks for the info, Asfand.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 asfand 12.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Haha, no problem. Always happy to help out the Adventurers' Guild.

:'''After leaving the Citadel of Regzar, you question several people in Sumeru City...'''

:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Seems Asfand was right about most people's attitudes here...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not only are they not interested in the Dendro Archon, they even say stuff like, "If the Akasha doesn't think I should know, then I don't need to know about it."
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been asking for information non-stop ever since we got to Sumeru, but the harder we try, the more hopeless everything seems.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Isn't there at least one person in this entire city who cares about Lesser Lord Kusanali?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh? You two are interested in Lesser Lord Kusanali?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Who are you?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''???:''' From the sound of it, you two are outlanders who recently arrived here. You've been asking around for information on Lesser Lord Kusanali, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I am Dunyarzad, one of Lesser Lord Kusanali's faithful followers!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, really? Then do you know how we can meet with her?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I'm afraid I can't help you with that, but your conversation earlier did happen to remind me of a legend about the Dendro Archon.
:{{DIcon}} What sort of legend?
:{{DIcon}} Can you tell us the legend?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Sure. It goes like this: Long, long ago, there was a man who heard a prophecy. It predicted that a great calamity was about to befall him.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Panicked by what he heard, the man sought out the Dendro Archon in the hopes that she would bless him with the wisdom to help him escape his predicament.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' The man journeyed across deserts and through rainforests, and experienced tribulations of every kind. However, he still couldn't find any trace of the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 08.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' In despair, he thought, "Alas, the Archon has abandoned me!" He then had no choice but to sorrowfully resign to his fate.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... and then what happened?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 09.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' And then... the calamity came! But to his own surprise, the man felt somehow emboldened by the trials of his journey. By relying on his own strength, he managed to overcome the adversity.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 10.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' At that moment, a bird perched upon his shoulder. This bird was, in fact, an avatar of the Dendro Archon. She said:
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 11.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' "O archon-seeker, do you now understand? She and her wisdom have long been found by you."
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 12.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' "Along your journey, we were in every flower and blade of grass, every ray of sparkling sun, and every breath of dancing wind. So long as you continue to think and ponder, we'll be wherever you go."
:{{DIcon}} What an amazing story.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, thanks for the story. Paimon feels all warm and fuzzy inside after that!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 13.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe, in a way, it seems like this story is also one of the Dendro Archon's avatars.
;(Camera pans to show two Eremites walking nearby)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dunyarzad, since you worship Lesser Lord Kusanali, can you tell us anything else about her?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 14.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Of course! So, did you two know that...
;(Dunyarzad notices the Eremites)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 dunyarzad 15.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Uh... Umm, I'm terribly sorry, but it seems something's come up now. Let's chat another day!
;(Dunyarzad runs away)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, wait! What the heck just happened?
:{{DIcon}} I think it has something to do with those people over there.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks like they're searching for someone... Hmm, Dunyarzad was acting super nervous just now. You think they're looking for her?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This stinks! We finally managed to find a lead about Lesser Lord Kusanali. We can't let them get in the way now!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 6 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see if we can get rid of them. Then we can catch up with Dunyarzad!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 7 muruwa 01.ogg}} '''Muruwa:''' Hey, have you two seen a brown-haired girl wearing a purple top and a long blue dress? We're lookin' for her.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did she have bandages wrapped around her wrists?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 7 muruwa 02.ogg}} '''Muruwa:''' Yes, that's her! Did you see which direction she went?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah, she went that way!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 7 muruwa 03.ogg}} '''Muruwa:''' Quick! After her!
;(The two Eremites leave)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, that should keep 'em busy for a while. Let's hurry and find Dunyarzad.

;(Talk to Hamasa or Muruwa, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq005 muruwa 01.ogg}} '''Muruwa:''' Strange. Where did she go? She couldn't have made it far.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq005 hamasa 01.ogg}} '''Hamasa:''' There's no way we can return to the master and mistress empty-handed. I'll ask around again.

;(Approach Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There you are, Dunyarzad! We thought you might've been long gone by now.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Ah! It's you two. You startled me there.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can relax now, we threw those people looking for you off the trail.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Really? Oh, thank you so much! Unfortunately, I believe there are still more of them out there looking for me.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Uh oh, looks like there are some coming this way...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? More of them!? Then what are we standing here for? Run!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' No, wait... I, uh... My body isn't in the best shape. It's difficult for me to run.
:{{DIcon}} How about we find someplace to hide?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Okay, sounds good. There's a tavern on the other side of the port that we can go to. They probably wouldn't expect me to hide in a place like that.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 8 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's move out. Stay behind us, we'll keep an eye out for anyone looking for you.

;(Talk to Sharaf or Aftab, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq005 sharaf 01.ogg}} '''Sharaf:''' Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a brown-haired girl wearing a purple top and a long blue dress?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq005 aftab 01.ogg}} '''Aftab:''' Eh? What did you say? ...Oh, yes, I have a granddaughter!
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq005 sharaf 02.ogg}} '''Sharaf:''' I wasn't asking about your granddaughter. I asked if you had seen a young woman go by!
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq005 aftab 02.ogg}} '''Aftab:''' Ah yes, she and her parents settled down in Port Ormos... I haven't seen her in a long time.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq005 sharaf 03.ogg}} '''Sharaf:''' Eh...
----
;(Enter the tavern)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Whew, we made it. They shouldn't be able to find us now... Wait. Stand down, [[Dehya]]!
;(Dehya is suddenly behind the Traveler with an arm outstretched, to Paimon's shock)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 01a.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' My lady, who are these two?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 02a.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' They're travelers that I met on the street just a moment ago. They happened to notice that you all were searching for me, so they helped me hide.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I see. In that case, you two should scram. There's nothing here for you.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a sec, who the heck are you? And why are you shooing us away?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I'm Miss Dunyarzad's bodyguard, here to see that she returns home safe and sound.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' My lady, let's get going. You've been gone for so long that your parents are worrying themselves sick.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' And if I refuse to go with you?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It'd be easier for the both of us if you cooperated, but if you insist on not going, then I'll have to carry you like a sack of potatoes.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Dunyarzad already said she doesn't want to go back. Why are you still pushing her?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Stay out of this. You don't understand the situation.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Sorry, my lady. Even though I'm your bodyguard, your parents are my employers. I have to answer to them.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' ...How much?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Wait, what?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' How much [[Mora]] do I have to pay you to become your employer, so you never listen to my parents ever again? Double... Triple? Give me some time and I'll get that much!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' My lady, this isn't about Mora.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 10.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' *sigh* I don't know what you think of us Eremites, but let me say this: I like Mora, but I'll never go against my principles.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 11.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' That's why I'm here looking for you. Sure, it's an order from my employer, but my conscience was also telling me it's the right thing to do.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 12.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' And knowing your health, carelessly running around like this is gonna hurt ya. For the sake of those who love you, don't be stubborn.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' No, you're wrong! I'm aware of my limits, and I know what I'm doing. Honestly, the only people being stubborn right now are my parents.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' They know perfectly well that it makes no difference if I'm at home or not! They still won't accept reality!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 08.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' And every time I bring this up, they just change the subject. Dehya, you've been living with us a long time already. This should be old news to you.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 13.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 09.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Dehya, I know it hasn't been easy for Mother and Father, and I'm grateful for everything they've done for me, but there is someone else in this world I'm also grateful to.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 10.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Because she saved me. The love I have for her is the same I have for my parents.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 11.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' This is my life and my last chance, so I want to do something meaningful!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 14.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' My lady, are you sure what you're doing now is meaningful?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 12.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Yes, I'm sure. At least... it is to me.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 15.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' *sigh* Fine, I won't ask you to return home anymore.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 16.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' But lemme make something very clear: I'm only doing this because I respect your determination, not because I agree with you.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 13.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Thank you, Dehya! Sorry for being so rude just now. My nerves were acting up... And I even brought up your payment in such an offensive way...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 17.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Don't worry about it, my lady. I did say that I like Mora. Besides, that's our next topic of conversation.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 18.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Today's little excursion caused such a ruckus that every single bodyguard at the estate was deployed. It won't be easy to hide things from your old man.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 19.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Since this definitely won't be your last escapade, here's a little tip... You should at least make it look like your room and things are still in order when you leave. Also, you'll need someone to cover for you when you're out and about.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 20.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' So I'll let you hire me, my lady. This way, everyone wins. As for the pay... let's say half of what your father pays me. We can settle the bill when we return to the estate.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 14.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Okay, deal.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay, looks like they've reached an understanding.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 15.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} Dunyarzad, are you alright?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 16.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Haha, I'm fine, really. I just feel a little tired now that things have calmed down...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dehya 21.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' My lady, stop trying to look tough. We're already in a tavern, so let's rest up and grab some grub.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 dunyarzad 17.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I'm sorry for worrying you two. If you don't mind, I'd like for you to join us.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure! After you rest up, we wanna hear more about Lesser Lord Kusanali!

;(Approach the marked spot)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 lambad 01.ogg}} '''Lambad:''' Hah! Well, if it isn't Dehya! Haven't seen you in nearly half a year.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 lambad 02.ogg}} '''Lambad:''' Word on the street is that you are a bodyguard for the [[Homayani]] family now. Heh, don't you find that kind of work boring?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Heh, you get used to it. How about a menu over here!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 lambad 03.ogg}} '''Lambad:''' You got it. Huh? Isn't this lil' Miss Homayani herself? Heh, we don't get to serve personages like you very often. We'll be sure to prepare our very best!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Thank you, sir, but there's no need. I don't have a lot of Mora on me, and I really ought to save as much as I can.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 02a.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Ah, but please bring these two the best food you have. They're my new friends, so I want to be a good host for them.
:{{DIcon}} No need to break the bank, we'll eat whatever you order.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 01a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We're already super grateful for everything you told us about Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry about it. We'll pay for our own food.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 02b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, we're paying for ourselves now? Aww... Paimon kinda wanted to try something fancy, but we aren't exactly loaded. Guess Paimon will settle for something ordinary...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 lambad 04.ogg}} '''Lambad:''' How about our [[Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake]]s? They're our signature snack, and they run cheap. Look, other customers over there are eating some now.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? They look kinda burnt and dry... Uh, Paimon will pass.
:{{DIcon}} Picky Paimon? Now that's a first...
::{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, c'mon! Paimon has personal preferences too, you know!
:{{DIcon}} But you've cooked [[Slime]]s before...
::{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph! What do you have against my Slime dishes?

:'''After ordering, you continue chatting with Dunyarzad about Lesser Lord Kusanali...'''

:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dunyarzad, we asked a lot of people when we first arrived, and almost nobody was interested in Lesser Lord Kusanali. So what made you want to follow her?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Well, remember when you asked me if I knew how to meet the Dendro Archon? Even though I don't know how, I think I've actually seen her before.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, really?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Yes, it was when I was a child. At that time, my illness had kept me bedridden for the better part of a year.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I was stuck inside and couldn't make any friends, and my parents did their best to find treatments for me... But even then, the [[Akasha]] didn't have any helpful information.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' My younger self no longer had any hopes or dreams. One flare-up was so bad that I was in a semi-conscious state for several days.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Then one night, I woke up alone in my room. I was terrified, my body was paralyzed. Even if I cried, there was no sound.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 08.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' At that moment, an ethereal voice spoke in my mind: "Dunyarzad, don't be scared. You don't have to cry."
:;(A flashback begins)
:{{color|menu|Dunyarzad recalls something from her childhood...}}
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 nahida 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Dunyarzad, don't be scared. You don't have to cry.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 youngdunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Huh? Who are you? How do you know my name?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 nahida 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Umm, how do I explain this... You might not be able to understand, but actually, I know everything about you.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 youngdunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Really?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 nahida 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Of course. I know that you're scared of thunder, that you hate taking medicine every morning, and that you love counting the petals on your mom's skirt.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 youngdunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Wow, you really do know everything.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 nahida 04.ogg}} '''???:''' Dunyarzad, is there anything you want?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 youngdunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Want? Not really... I can't go anywhere or do anything.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 nahida 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Huh? But aren't you a child? All children have wishes. Tell me what you want, and maybe I can make it happen.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 youngdunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Then... Can you make my illness go away?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 nahida 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh... I'm sorry, but I'm not powerful enough to do that right now...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 youngdunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Then... Can you be my friend?
:;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 09.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' After that, the voice said, "Okay, I'll be your friend."
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 10.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Although my body was suffering during those days, that voice encouraged me and told me many wondrous things.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 11.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Beyond my window was the flourishing Sumeru City, beyond the city was a lush rainforest, and beyond that was the Wall of Samiel, deserts, and all of [[Teyvat]]...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 12.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Once I finally made it through that bout of illness, I couldn't hear the voice anymore. I told my mother about it, but she said that I must have been dreaming.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 13.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' But I know that that voice wasn't a figment of my imagination! Before that, I had never heard of "Teyvat."
:{{DIcon}} So you believe the voice you heard was...
:{{DIcon}} It was Lesser Lord Kusanali?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 14.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Yes, for sure!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 15.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' If it weren't for that voice, I would have never grown curious about the outside world, nor would I have learned how to read and enjoy so many books.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 16.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' That voice sparked a desire for wisdom &mdash; it had to have been the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 17.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I've been hoping for a chance to repay her kindness. In fact, I was running around today to help prepare the [[Sabzeruz Festival]] for her!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the Sabzeruz Festival?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 18.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' It is Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday, which is the day that she was found by the sages.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 19.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' It's actually an old holiday that originally celebrated Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthday. When she passed away, the holiday eventually became a celebration of the Lesser Lord's birthday.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 20.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I heard everyone was overjoyed when they welcomed her back to Sumeru. In those days, the festival was a huge deal.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 21.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' But because of the Akademiya's influence, people have gradually lost interest in the festival.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 22.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' The Akademiya actively participates in Sumeru's many holidays dedicated to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, but when it comes to the Sabzeruz Festival, forget any funding, they practically act like it doesn't exist.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 23.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Maybe they see Lesser Lord Kusanali's birth as confirmation of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, so they're reluctant to celebrate it.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, but that's awful!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 24.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' It is. It's absolutely terrible!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 25.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Sure, the Greater Lord founded Sumeru, but hasn't Lesser Lord Kusanali been the one quietly protecting us for the past few hundred years?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' *ahem* Just remember that we're still out in public. Don't get too carried away now...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 26.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I know that people over by the [[Grand Bazaar]] still hold the Sabzeruz Festival to this day. But I hadn't met any of them before, so I was never able to contribute.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 27.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' But recently, I made a friend there who also follows Lesser Lord Kusanali!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 28.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I gave her my savings because I want her to throw a wonderful festival this year. That's the least I could do for Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hold on. My lady, does this friend happen to be [[Nilou]]? The one who sends flowers to the estate?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 29.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Yes, that's her.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I saw her leaving the other day with a nervous look on her face, it seemed like she was hiding something in her arms. Did you give her something?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 30.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Ah, yes... Initially, I didn't have much Mora prepared, so I had Nilou sell one of my skirts.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 31.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I've agreed with Nilou to meet up at the Grand Bazaar today and see how things are coming along. Dehya, would you accompany me?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Sure. That's quite the trip though &mdash; I'll carry you.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 32.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' No, that would be too much, even for you.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' You might as well just accept the lift. If I let you walk, who knows how long it'll take us! And if anything happens to you, then I'd really never hear the end of it from your father.
:{{DIcon}} Can we also come along?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 10 dunyarzad 33.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' But of course! Nilou will be thrilled to hear that there are more people interested in Lesser Lord Kusanali.
----
;(Pass through the door to the Grand Bazaar)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Sorry I'm late, Nilou.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, Dunyarzad! It was taking you so long that I assumed you got trapped at home, but you made it in the end!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Uh oh, but if Dehya's here, that means you got caught, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' You could say that, but everything worked out! She's on our side now.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hah, not completely.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh? And who are these two?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 dunyarzad 03a.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Oh, meet (Traveler) and Paimon, my two newest friends. They're visitors who just arrived at Sumeru City and are looking for information on Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' So you're followers from another land?
:{{DIcon}} Yep!
::{{A|vo xmaq005 11 nilou 05a.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' That's wonderful! You two absolutely mustn't miss the Sabzeruz Festival!
:{{DIcon}} Truthfully, no.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 11 nilou 05b.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, really? Well, that's okay. You're still invited to the Sabzeruz Festival!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' By the way, Dunyarzad, we've already started decorating the Grand Bazaar. It looks spectacular, thanks to your generous contribution!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' You're very welcome! It's the only thing I could do. Do you still have enough Mora?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 11 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Uh, probably...? But don't sweat it. We've already finished renovating the stage! Come on, I'll show you.

;(Approach the marked spot)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, this place is amazing!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Not bad. Heh, the last time I was here, the stairs were full of holes.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' The stairs were nothing! A little while ago, we discovered that the tree above the stage had a huge chunk of bark ready to fall off. Mr. [[Zubayr]] was worried sick!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' We reported it to the Akademiya many times, but they never sent anyone to deal with it. We didn't want anything bad happening, so we were going to cancel all the stage performances.
:{{DIcon}} Why didn't anyone come to handle it?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Oh, probably because it was the theater asking.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' The Akademiya looks down on performers like us. They probably think it would be best if the theater closed down completely.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' We can't let that happen, though. Not only would everyone involved in the theater go hungry, but then we wouldn't be able to hold the Sabzeruz Festival anymore.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Thank the Dendro Archon for Dunyarzad! With the Mora she gave us, we hired someone to patch up the tree, and we also gave the stage a much-needed makeover.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' The stage is going to be even prettier when it's festival time! I can't wait for you to see it!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' And I can't wait to see you on the stage! You've been practicing so long already &mdash; it's almost time for your dream to become reality!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' It's OUR dream! I'll do my best for the two of us.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nilou, what are you gonna be doing at the festival?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' She'll be dancing the [[Dance of Sabzeruz]], the most important performance at the Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 08a.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Dunyarzad, have you told them the origin of this holiday?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I only told them about the Greater Lord and Lesser Lord so far.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 09.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Okay, then I'll tell you two about how this holiday came to be...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 10.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' According to legend, the Sabzeruz Festival was originally the [[Goddess of Flowers]]' birthday celebration for the Greater Lord.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 11.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' A long, long time ago, on one of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthdays, her friends threw her a celebratory banquet.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 12.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Some of the gods got drunk. One started playing music and the Greater Lord started singing, so the Goddess of Flowers began to dance.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 13.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' As she danced upon the grass, countless beautiful [[Padisarah]]s began to bloom wherever she stepped.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 14.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Those brilliant purple flowers became her dazzling stage. All the gods clamored, "Oh, if only time could stop at this very moment."
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like they had a great time.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 15a.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Of course they did! When people mention the gods, they always think of the [[Archon War]], but Sumeru's gods also had happy times.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds somewhat bittersweet.
::{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 15b.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Huh, really? Oh, you probably mean because all the gods in this story are no longer alive.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 16.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Although they aren't around anymore, they're preserved in our tradition of dance. This outfit I'm wearing is apparently based on how the Goddess of Flowers looked.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 17.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Though we're just tiny people compared to the divine, we still have to do our best to make sure that the birthday girl feels loved on her special day.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dunyarzad 04.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Nilou, you of all people will definitely be able to convey our well wishes to the Dendro Archon. I also noticed that you went the extra mile and scattered Padisarahs around the stage.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 18.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, they symbolize the Goddess of Flowers after all. It's just a shame that all the real Padisarahs went extinct after her death.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dunyarzad 05.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Yeah. The Greater Lord brought forth Padisarahs in memory of the Goddess of Flowers, but she ultimately could never truly replicate that beautiful purple.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 19.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Thinking about the Goddess of Flowers' dance makes me wish I could've seen it.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 20.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' If my stage were anything like that... *sigh* I'd be thrilled if I had just two real Padisarahs on the stage.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 21.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' So Traveler and Paimon, what do you think? Interested in the Sabzeruz Festival? Will you two be coming?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dunyarzad 06.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' All of Lesser Lord Kusanali's followers will be there for her birthday. It'll be a good opportunity for you to learn more about her.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon thinks that's a great idea!
:{{DIcon}} You sure it's not because you want in on the fun?
::{{A|vo xmaq005 12 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey c'mon, there's nothing wrong with enjoying a festival! Besides, it's Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday. She'll be happy to have more people who are celebrating it.
:{{DIcon}} You sure it's not because you want to watch Nilou dance?
::{{A|vo xmaq005 12 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course Paimon wants to watch! Those two things aren't mutually exclusive, you know.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 dunyarzad 07.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Hehe, so how about we all attend the Sabzeruz Festival together?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like a plan!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 22.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Dunyarzad, let me show you which stage decorations we've picked out so far. Traveler and Paimon, if that doesn't sound interesting to you, then feel free to explore the area.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 nilou 23.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Everyone at the Grand Bazaar loves Lesser Lord Kusanali, and we're all looking forward to the Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In that case, we'll take a look around.
----
;(Talk to Dehya)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Revamping the stage for the festival couldn't have been easy, that's for sure. I bet this year's festival will be one to remember.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I don't know much about the Grand Bazaar, but I do know that the residents here have a penchant for song and dance... Heh, two things that the Akademiya doesn't particularly approve of.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Oh, and the perfume sold around here is a lot better than what you'll find elsewhere. The fragrances are longer-lasting, and they're gentler on your skin...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Uh, I mean... that's what I've heard, at least!

;(Talk to Farhad)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 farhad 01.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' Things are really shaping up, and there's a buzz around the festival this year. We're expecting people from all over to come by this year and buy things during the festivities.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 farhad 02.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' Don't be fooled into thinking that Sumeru City has the best of everything. Some festival snacks are only offered here in the Grand Bazaar.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 farhad 03.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' And when it comes to musicians, dancers, or singers, the Grand Bazaar's got the best of the best! Sure, those folks at the Akademiya might not like it, but what's a festival without song and dance?

;(Talk to Kumari)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 kumari 01a.ogg}} '''Kumari:''' Whoa, what's with your yellow hair? And why do your clothes look so funny? Are you an outlander?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 kumari 02.ogg}} '''Kumari:''' Did you know that the Sabzeruz Festival is about to happen? There'll be loads of fun things to do at the festival, but the best part is when [[Farris]], the Knight of Flowers, passes out candy to everyone!

;(Talk to Shrimati)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 shrimati 01.ogg}} '''Shrimati:''' Ah, dancing at the Sabzeruz Festival. You know, I also danced when I was younger.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 shrimati 02.ogg}} '''Shrimati:''' As a child, I even asked my grandmother why we performed the dance for the Lesser Lord when it was originally done to honor the Greater Lord.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 shrimati 03.ogg}} '''Shrimati:''' My grandmother said that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is a beloved deity and honored by all, and Lesser Lord Kusanali is too. If the Goddess of Flowers ever knew Lesser Lord Kusanali, then she would certainly have wished to be her friend and hold celebrations for her, too!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 shrimati 04.ogg}} '''Shrimati:''' The Sabzeruz Festival has been losing its appeal over the years... That is, until a wealthy benefactor stepped in this year and brought the festival back to life. I heard she forked out a lot of Mora to make it all happen.

;(Talk to Dunyarzad or Nilou)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Nilou, your outfit looks amazing. There's also something different about you from when we first met up.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, I thought I'd add little extra pizzazz to my dress for the festival. See?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Wow, did you sew all that yourself?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Uh-huh, sewing is a fundamental skill for everyone in the theater company because we make all our own costumes. Did you know that Mr. Zubayr not only can make costumes, but props too?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, I've noticed that you can't keep your eyes off that crown over there. Would you like to try it on?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Oh, may I?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Of course! The legends say that the Goddess of Flowers had beautiful horns on her head, so this crown was made to reflect that. Ah, Dunyarzad! You look absolutely stunning with it on! It's like I'm looking at the Goddess of Flowers herself...

----
;(After talking to all of the people)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, is that who Paimon thinks it is? It looks like... Katheryne!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' ♪ *hums* ♪
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, come to think of it, Paimon's only ever seen her behind the counter at the Adventurers' Guild... This is the first time we've ever seen her taking a break.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Katheryne!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Hmm? Oh, hey, it's the Traveler and Paimon. What's shakin'?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, break time Katheryne sure sounds a lot less formal than usual. Paimon was still waiting for her to say "ad astra abyssosque"!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Sure, standing behind the counter at the Adventurers' Guild doesn't require any complicated functions.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' But saying and doing the same old things over and over again can get pretty monotonous, like watching the same [[Fontaine]] movie day after day.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' But take you two for example. You travel across Teyvat to enrich your lives and gain new experiences.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we enjoy traveling across Teyvat and all that, but we're mainly looking for clues about {{MC|his sister|her brother}}.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 06.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Yes, and you should keep searching. Sometimes the answers we're looking for aren't necessarily at our intended destination. Instead, they're found along the way.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, haven't we heard someone say something pretty similar recently? Anyways, what brings you out here, Katheryne?
:{{DIcon}} Are you also a fan of the Sabzeruz Festival?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 07.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' No, not particularly, I guess you could say that I'm loving the recent atmosphere here. If festivals bring happiness to everyone, then that's where their true value lies.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 08.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Oh, it looks like it's about time for me to be heading back now.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, we'll see you next time at the Adventurers' Guild! Oh, by the way, thanks for connecting us with the Eremites. We've already made some great friends in Sumeru City thanks to you!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 katheryne 09.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' I'm sure you two will get along well with the people here. You've already been blessed by the element of [[Dendro]], after all. See ya around!
;(Katheryne leaves)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, there's something really different about Katheryne today...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hey, Traveler, Paimon.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh hey, Dehya. What's going on?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I've got something to tell ya. My lady knows you're looking for ways to meet Lesser Lord Kusanali, and she's been trying to come up with a way to help you. Well, I have an idea that might help.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you serious? We'd love that!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It might not necessarily pan out, so don't get your hopes up too much. I'll need to take you two somewhere and ask someone some questions.
:{{DIcon}} What about Dunyarzad?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' My lady is feeling a little worn out at the moment. Nilou's found a place for her to rest. After I take my lady home, let's meet in front of the Citadel of Regzar.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 14 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like a plan!

;(After the dialogue)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head over to the Citadel of Regzar and wait for Dehya.
----
;(Approach the Citadel)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Sorry, I'm late. It took some convincing for the master and mistress to believe that Miss Dunyarzad was only sitting in the port for a while because she was in a bad mood.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Anyway, I guess I should be thanking you. I haven't seen Miss Dunyarzad that happy in a long time. If wasn't for you two, she probably would've been caught and dragged back much earlier.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure sound a whole lot nicer than when we first met, Dehya. Who would've thought you had such a soft spot for Dunyarzad?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Tch, it's called being a professional. I'm a bodyguard, and I work for whoever's paying.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, look! Dehya's blushing!
:{{DIcon}} Yep, that's a blush if I've ever seen one.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Ugh! Listen, you two...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I don't expect to be working for Miss Dunyarzad very long, but I hope to finish things on a positive note if possible... Let's cut the chitchat and head into the Citadel. We'll see if the person I know has a way for you two to meet with the Lesser Lord.
:;(Dehya brings the Traveler and Paimon into the Citadel)
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Oh, heya Chief!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 01.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Ah, Dehya! What're you doing here? And well, well, didn't expect to see you three together.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hah! I take it you all know each other already?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm! We met this morning after the Adventurers' Guild pointed us to Asfand for more info.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 08a.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' No kidding... So where's [[Rukh Shah]]? I thought I'd help these two out by asking about the theft. Anything you can tell 'em?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 02.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Rukh Shah's gone over to the Akademiya. The Grand Sage recently ordered Sumeru City to begin bolstering its defenses, so people from all over have been called back to the city.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 03.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Ahem, since you've already mentioned the theft, I suppose I might as well tell 'em what we know.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Appreciate it, Chief!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, theft?... Sorry, what the heck are you guys talking about?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 10.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Just recently, the Akademiya lost something... and there's a chance the item is connected with the Dendro Archon. This case might just somehow help you in meeting her.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 04.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Heh, I suppose that's one way to look at it, but if ya ask me, the case is more about the Akademiya than anything else.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 05.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Lemme fill ya in. The Akademiya recently sent a convoy to pick up an important package from [[Aaru Village]]. Word got out, and the convoy was robbed on its way back.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 06.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' The Grand Sage took the whole matter very seriously. Not only did he dispatch the matra, but also enlisted our help in the search for leads. All we know so far is that whatever was stolen is currently in Port Ormos.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 11.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' You two have heard of Port Ormos, haven't ya? It's the largest commercial port in all of Sumeru. You can travel there by leaving Sumeru City and heading south along the river.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 12.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' The Akademiya's grip isn't long enough to reach all the way to Port Ormos, so the city's a little more laid back, meaning the population's also a mixed bag. You never know who you'll meet there.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 07.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Apparently, what was lost has a great deal to do with the Akasha, knowledge, and even the gods. I'm afraid I don't have any other details for ya, though...
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 08.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' If you're interested, maybe you could head to Port Ormos and ask around yourselves. If you want my advice, try introducing yourselves as students of the Akademiya once you're there.
:{{DIcon}} Huh? Students of the Akademiya?
:{{DIcon}} Why should we do that?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 13.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Are ya serious, Chief? All the Akademiya students are in Sumeru City, you know... Why should they pretend to be students in Port Ormos?
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 09.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Heh, if you're all so interested, just go there and see what happens!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 14.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Count me out. I've got plenty of work to do here for the Homayani family.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 15.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' And take it from me: If you two really do decide to visit Port Ormos, you'd best watch your backs. Let's just say that the Eremites there aren't nearly as friendly as those here in Sumeru City.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 16.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' There are even some extremists who go around shouting slogans like "Retake Sumeru for King Deshret!" Word is that more and more are joining their movement. They're becoming a real headache for Chief and the others.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 asfand 10.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' You bet they are. *sigh* King Deshret's been dead for thousands of years. Now they start spreading rumors of his return. Ridiculous!
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 17.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Not everyone's like you, Chief. Even the desert natives who abandoned their homes in the wilderness still wish to have a god of their own.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 18.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Well, (Traveler), that's about all the information we have for you.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, Dehya! And you too, Asfand.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Since we've gathered all we could for the moment in Sumeru City, let's head to Port Ormos and see what we can find next.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 19.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Miss Dunyarzad is looking forward to seeing you both at the Sabzeruz Festival, so be sure to get yourselves back here in time for that.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, we won't forget.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, we will.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 16 dehya 20.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Good. Then we'll see you both at the Sabzeruz Festival.
;(Quest completes)

;(Talk to Asfand again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq006 asfand 01.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' Hah, you two must really be something if you've got Dehya the Flame-Mane speaking on your behalf.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq006 asfand 02.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' The Corps of Thirty isn't officially overseen by Akademiya, but because we're hired mercs, there's still lots of sensitive intel that I can't reveal to ya. In the end, when it comes down to it, the city's safety is both the Corps' and Akademiya's top priority.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq006 asfand 03.ogg}} '''Asfand:''' I've told you all I can about what was stolen from the Akademiya... As for why you should pretend to be students in Port Ormos, I'll leave that for you to find out yourself.

;(Talk to Dehya again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq006 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It's been a while since I've visited the Citadel of Regzar. I'll catch up with Chief for a bit before I head back myself. He really did a lot for me in the past.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq006 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Remember, to get to Port Ormos, just follow the river south from Sumeru City's port.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq006 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Just be sure to take care of yourselves out there. We'll meet again at the Sabzeruz Festival.
