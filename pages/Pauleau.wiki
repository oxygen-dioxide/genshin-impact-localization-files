==Profile==
Pauleau is a member of Aurelie's troupe. He was in love with her, but she rejected him, saying that she views the troupe members as brothers and sisters. When Aurelie was killed, Pauleau took it hard, and struggled with finishing the script for "The Little Oceanid" in time in Poisson. In the show, he plays Clio's lover; Clio was an Oceanid, and this role was dedicated to Aurelie.
