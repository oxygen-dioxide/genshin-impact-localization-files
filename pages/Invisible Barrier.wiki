==Gameplay Notes==
* Collecting the three Transparent Ruins Records grants the {{Achievement|The King of Four Lands}}.
* The Transparent Ruins Records can be obtained before starting any of the prerequisite quests for ''Invisible Barrier'', including the ''[[Golden Slumber]]'' World Quest series. However, no dialogue will appear during exploration.
* Paimon will still comment when approaching a Transparent Ruin that has already been completed, treating it as though it is a new ruin. That is to say, if a first ruin is completed, then is left and returned to later, Paimon will use the dialogue for entering the second ruin, and so on.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Soheil's archaeological notes record his desert adventures in his youth. Some of the ruins mentioned may contain treasures and old documents. Head into the depths of the desert again to look for them.}}
{{Quest Description|update|Soheil mentioned in his notes that there were four transparent ruins that he could not enter. Go to the places he has marked.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the first Transparent Ruin)
:'''Paimon:''' These must be the Transparent Ruins mentioned in Soheil's old notes!
:'''Paimon:''' It's just as he described it. There's practically no difference between it and its surroundings, and it's see-through!

;(Approach the second Transparent Ruin)
:'''Paimon:''' Another set of transparent ruins, eh? Well, we know what to do to get in this time!

;(Approach the third Transparent Ruin)
:'''Paimon:''' That's the third ruin. We should find something here!

;(If the player approaches a Transparent Ruin that was explored prior to starting the quest)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so these must be the Transparent Ruins mentioned in Soheil's old notes!
:'''Paimon:''' We've seen similar things before, haven't we? Who knew that someone else would be so interested in them, eh?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, let's keep exploring the remaining ruins. If we find something we don't understand, we'll just hand that over to Soheil!

;(Open the chest in the northeastern Transparent Ruin)<!--Transparent Ruin Record (I)-->

::'''Paimon:''' Alright, on to the next set of Transparent Ruins!
;(If opened second)
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, a stone slate, and this one's got words on it! Soheil will be so excited!
::'''Paimon:''' Two more ruins. Let's do this!
;(If opened third)
::'''Paimon:''' Hoo, well, guess that's another stone slate after all. That was the expected result... but it was still disappointing.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, we've got one last set of ruins left. That said, Paimon kinda knows what we'll find there already.
;(If opened last)
::'''Paimon:''' Aaand yup, that's another stone slate alright.
::'''Paimon:''' Let's go back to Aaru Village and have Soheil see what the inscriptions on these slates are about.

;(Open the chest in the northwestern Transparent Ruin)<!--Transparent Ruin Record (II)-->

;(If opened second)
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's another slate for us. Paimon can see Soheil hopping up and down in excitement already!
::'''Paimon:''' Two more ruins. Let's do this!
;(If opened third)
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's another slate for us. Paimon can see Soheil hopping up and down in excitement already!
::'''Paimon:''' One last set of ruins. Let's do this!
;(If opened last)
::'''Paimon:''' Yay, a stone slate. That brings our total haul up to three!
::'''Paimon:''' Let's go back to Aaru Village and have Soheil see what the inscriptions on these slates are about.

;(Open the chest in the southeastern Transparent Ruin)<!--no Transparent Ruin Record-->
;(If opened first)
::'''Paimon:''' Huh. Nothing much of a discovery here... Just some stone shards.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, that was a letdown. Hopefully we'll find something more in the next set of Transparent Ruins...
;(If opened second)
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? It's just some stone bits... Where's the stone slate?
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like there isn't treasure at the end of every search, huh? That's kind of a letdown.
;(If opened third)
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? It's just some stone bits... Where's the stone slate?
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like there isn't treasure at the end of every search, huh?
::'''Paimon:''' Well, there is one last set of ruins left. Let's have a look there.
;(If opened last)
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? Where's the stone slate? There's nothing here but some smashed stone...
::'''Paimon:''' Gah! Paimon was disappointed before when we found the stone slate, but this has gotta be double the disappointment!
