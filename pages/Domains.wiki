'''Domains''' are instances located in temple like entrances in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. Completing the challenges within rewards various items and materials such as [[Artifacts]], [[Talent Level-Up Materials]], [[Weapon Ascension Materials]], [[Mora]], [[Adventure EXP]], [[Weapon Enhancement Materials]], [[Companionship EXP]] in return for some [[Original Resin]].

Some domains give a small reward of [[Primogem]]s and [[Adventure EXP]] when discovered; some of these domains may require puzzles or quests to be solved or completed beforehand in order to access them.

==Permanent Domains==
Permanent Domains are landmarks in [[Teyvat]]. They have a clearly marked Domain Entrance and can be used as [[Teleport Waypoints]] once unlocked.

On the map, domains are marked as follows: {{Item|Spiral Abyss|20|type=UI|notext=1}} for the [[Spiral Abyss]], {{Item|Challenge Domains|20|type=UI|notext=1}} for Challenge Domains, and {{Item|Domains|20|type=UI|notext=1}} for Trounce and One-Time Domains.

===Challenge Domains===
These domains have three stages that are open on a varied basis. Each stage is open for three days each week; two set days, with the third day, Sunday, being consistent for all stages.

====Domains of Forgery====

===Trounce Domains===
{{Main|Trounce Domains}}
Trounce Domains are powerful [[Weekly Bosses]] that can be re-challenged after completing their respective [[Archon Quest|Archon]] or [[Story Quest|Story]] Quests. They can be accessed on all days of the week.
<section begin="trouncerule" />
*Trounce Domains contain unusually powerful opponents. After successfully completing the challenge, you can obtain abundant rewards.
*Players can complete this domain as many times as they want, but can only collect rewards once per week by using 30 [[Original Resin]] to open the [[Ley Line Blossom]] for the first three Weekly Bosses, and 60 Original Resin subsequently. Rewards are refreshed with [[Reset#Weekly World Reset|Weekly World Reset]].<section end="trouncerule" />

===One-Time Domains===
{{Main|One-Time Domains}}
One-Time Domains are unique domains that are denoted by a smaller blue circle that provide a set reward upon the first time a player completes them. They are still open after the first completion but will not offer any rewards. One-Time Domains provide an early boost to [[Adventure Rank]] through their [[Adventure EXP]] rewards and sometimes offer unique [[Food]] recipes, along with [[Primogem]]s.

===Spiral Abyss===
{{Main|Spiral Abyss}}
Spiral Abyss is a special type of Domain that changes over time. It is unlocked at Adventure Rank 20 and can be accessed through the wormhole in the sky at the edge of Cape Oath. Each Stage of the Spiral Abyss counts as a domain challenge for the [[Battle Pass]].

==Temporary Domains==
Temporary Domains only exists during a quest or event. Some of them use a permanent domain entrance, but most of them use a cavern or other terrain feature as entrance.

===Quest Domains===
{{Main|Quest Domains}}
Quest Domains are unique one-time domains that can only be accessed as part of an [[Archon Quest|Archon]], [[Story Quest|Story]], or [[World Quest]]s. Once complete they can no longer be visited, hence, one should check for hidden chests thoroughly.

===Event Domains===
{{Main|Event Domains}}
Event Domains are domains that are available during a time-limited event. Some event domains are accessible in the overworld, identifiable by its unique doorway entrance. Other event domains are accessible via the event menu. All "Test Run" domains are event domains.

==Co-Op Mode==
{{Main|Co-Op Mode}}
Some domains can be completed in [[Co-Op Mode]]. This involves pressing the "Match" button in the Domain entrance screen to invite other players to one's world or join other players' worlds. After that, the host can invite other players in their world to join a Co-Op session to complete the domain or boss fight.

If a player falls in battle within the domain, they can enter spectator mode and will be able to rotate the camera view to see the other players battle in the domain.

==Trivia==
*Domains probably got their inspiration from ''{{w|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild}}'', a 2017 open-world adventure role-playing game released by Nintendo for their Switch console. In that game, players could enter "Shrines" to complete puzzles and fight monsters in exchange for spirit orbs. Trounce Domains are most similar to Breath of the Wild's "Dungeons" or "Divine Beasts", where puzzles must be solved in order to fight off a spirit of Calamity Ganon.
*The challenge domains contain a [[Irminsul|petrified tree]] at the exit after clearing them. According to [[Albedo]],<ref>{{Ref/VO|Albedo|Interesting Things}}</ref> these trees are considered to be young, with ancient trees being one or two miles in height with an unknown spider species living in its roots. These have yet to appear in-game.
