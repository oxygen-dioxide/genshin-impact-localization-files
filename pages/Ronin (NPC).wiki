'''Ronin''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Woven Wishes}}.

==Profile==
The unnamed Ronin is part of a vagrant group who stole goods from the [[International Trade Association]], knowing that the [[Kanjou Commission]] would not try to persecute them due to Inazuma's hostility towards foreigners. [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]], who was looking for silk so [[Ogura Mio]] could make some new robes for her, learned of the theft from [[Kurisu]]. Along with the [[Traveler]], the ronin and his group were surprised to be discovered but bullied Kurisu into submission before demanding a payment to get the silk back. Ayaka, reminding Kurisu of their agreement, easily defeated the ronin and his group, causing them to scatter.

===Appearance===
He takes on the form of a [[Nobushi: Hitsukeban]].
