==Profile==
The unnamed Ronin is part of a vagrant group who stole goods from the [[International Trade Association]], knowing that the [[Kanjou Commission]] would not try to persecute them due to Inazuma's hostility towards foreigners. [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]], who was looking for silk so [[Ogura Mio]] could make some new robes for her, learned of the theft from [[Kurisu]]. Along with the [[Traveler]], the ronin and his group were surprised to be discovered but bullied Kurisu into submission before demanding a payment to get the silk back. Ayaka, reminding Kurisu of their agreement, easily defeated the ronin and his group, causing them to scatter.

===Personality===
The unnamed ronin is an arrogant and intelligent individual as he brazenly stole from the International Trade Association knowing that the Kanjou Commission would not pursue them for the theft. He despised foreign merchants, believing them to be worms leeching off the native people. Despite his hatred towards them, he was nearly able to strongarm Kurisu into paying up knowing that he could not afford to fight back, but he had underestimated the situation by failing to recognize Ayaka as a member of the [[Kamisato Clan]], who were closest to the people of Inazuma.

===Appearance===
He takes on the form of a [[Nobushi: Hitsukeban]].
