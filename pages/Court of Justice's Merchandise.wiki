|description    = A two-story building with a semi-open counter. The first floor is used for fast-moving consumer goods with short shelf-life and high volume, where freshness is key, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. The second floor is reserved for the storage of packaged and bottled goods. A cargo lift operated by [[clockwork meka]] is installed between the floors to achieve highly efficient usage of the building's space while maintaining the store's operational efficiency, so customers never have to wait too long at the counter to purchase high-quality goods. [[Damoville Purveyor]] took advantage of the operational efficiency brought about by this type of building to gradually improve their reputation, ultimately becoming one of the most famous department stores in [[Fontaine]].
