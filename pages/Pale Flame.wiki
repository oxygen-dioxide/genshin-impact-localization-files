'''Pale Flame''' is an [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities which can be obtained from [[Ridge Watch]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*The 4-piece effect stacks' duration will refresh upon obtaining a new stack, allowing for any character with an Elemental Skill with a cooldown below 7 seconds to take full advantage of this effect.
*The 4-piece Attack bonus only applies to the character that generates the Elemental Skill attack, and they need to be on field for the bonus to take effect. For example, with [[Fischl]]'s [[Nightrider]] skill ('Oz') she is the only character to benefit, and will not benefit if switched out whilst Oz attacks foes. If switched back in subsequent attacks can trigger the bonus. The same applies to Elemental Skills that are bound to the active character such as [[Qiqi]]'s [[Adeptus Art: Herald of Frost]] - this only benefits Qiqi when the skill hits when she is on field.

==Trivia==
* The lore for this artifact set appears to be about members of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].
** Mocking Mask refers to [[Pierro]], the first of the Harbingers.
** The story of the Wise Doctor's Pinion is most likely about [[Il Dottore]], given the shared elements in their names (''Dottore'' being Italian for "doctor") and Dottore once had a research facility of [[Ruin Machines]].
** The story of Moment of Cessation most likely refers to [[Pantalone]], who is in charge of Snezhnaya's economic policies. [[Andrei]] states that Snezhnaya's strong economy is thanks to Pantalone's efforts, and Pantalone himself has become immensely wealthy after becoming one of the Fatui &mdash; he gave [[Goth]] enough money to rent out the entire [[Goth Grand Hotel]] indefinitely.
** The story of the Surpassing Cup most likely refers to [[Scaramouche]], who, as stated by [[Yae Miko]], was a prototype for the creation of the puppet Raiden Shogun, later wandering the land as an ordinary human male until he came across the Fatui.
** The story of the Stainless Bloom most likely refers to [[Signora]], who was given a Delusion to seal her Pyro abilities.
***Signora, during her story boss fight, says "Pale Flame" twice, once in the first phase when her ice cocoon is low on HP and at the beginning of her second phase.
