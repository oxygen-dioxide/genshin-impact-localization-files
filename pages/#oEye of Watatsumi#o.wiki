'''''"Eye of Watatsumi"''''' is part of the [[The Moon-Bathed Deep]] World Quest Series.

==Steps==
# Go to the "Eye"
# Read the stone tablet at the "Eye"
# Break the seal over the shrine
#* Use [[Elemental Sight]] to locate the three Elemental Orbs, and use {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Anemo}}, or {{Geo}} to disperse them. ({{Electro}} and {{Hydro}} will not work, although {{Hydro}} will cause the Elemental Orb to be visually [[Electro-Charged]], even without Elemental Sight.) Several enemies may appear, but they do not need to be defeated.
#** At the north orb (near the water), no enemies spawn, but the following enemies that are unrelated to the quest are in the vicinity: {{Enemy List|Ruin Destroyer*2}}
#** At the northwest orb (on the cliff): {{Enemy List|Anemo Specter*3}}
#** At the south orb (near the water): {{Enemy List|Electro Slime*4;Mutant Electro Slime*2}}
# Obtain the [[Spirit Pearl]]

==Gameplay Notes==
* ''"Eye of Watatsumi"'' can be done either before or after the quests ''{{LL|"Fang of Watatsumi"|,}}'' ''{{LL|"Fin of Watatsumi"|,}}'' and ''{{LL|"Tail of Watatsumi"|.}}''

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You must first break the five seals on Watatsumi Island if you wish to enter [[Enkanomiya]].}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On approaching the "Eye")
:'''Paimon:''' This must be the "Eye" that Tsuyuko was talking about!
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|An ancient stone tablet stands beside the shrine. Will there be anything of use written on it?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On examining the tablet nearby)
:'''Ancient Stone Tablet:''' "...They say that Omikami's envoy had three eyes: one for the 'soul', one a 'mirror', and the last the 'truth'..."
:'''Ancient Stone Tablet:''' "...From the depths it arose, from the {{Color|buzzword|south}}, o'er the {{Color|buzzword|north}}, and all about the {{Color|buzzword|western}} mound..."
:'''Ancient Stone Tablet:''' "...The tree eyes shone mercilessly to ward off the dragon's heir..."
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon... knows all these words... but none of them mean anything when strung together.
:'''Paimon:''' It doesnt look like there are any clues around here either, so why don't we try using {{Color|buzzword|Elemental Sight}}?
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|With the help of the stone tablet's instructions, perhaps breaking the shrine seal will not be a problem... Right?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After clearing away one elemental orb)
:'''Paimon:''' We've broken one seal!

;(After clearing away the elemental orb on the cliff)
:'''Paimon:''' Where did these [[Specters]] come from? Were they attracted here by the sealed elemental power?

;(After clearing away the elemental orb near the water)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, the elemental energy from the broken seal has attracted slimes!

;(After clearing all three seals)
:'''Paimon:''' All the seals have been removed. Let's see if anything changed at the shrine!
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|You have finally broken the shrine's seal, and the Spirit Pearl is yours to claim. Go forth and take it!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On examining the shrine - if this was the first shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' We found a pearl. Is this the Spirit Pearl Tsuyuko talked about?

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the second shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' There's another Spirit Pearl!

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the third shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' And that's a third! We're getting close!

;(On examining the shrine - if this was the fourth shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' Fourth Spirit Pearl obtained! Let's go find Tsuyuko!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* The seal placed on every shrine reads as "Ad Virtutem" which is Latin for "to power."
* Only the Ruin Destroyers will drop loot, so just escape if you want for the other ones.
