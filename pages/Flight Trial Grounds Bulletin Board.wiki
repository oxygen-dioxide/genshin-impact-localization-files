===Emergency Notice===
<!--Likely only available after "The Rainbow Destined to Burn"-->
:'''Emergency Notice:''' "Listen carefully, everyone: I have discussed this with [[Mutota|the chief]], and everyone needs to be examined again. Only those who make the cut in both mental and physical aptitude will be issued their wings once more!"
:'''Emergency Notice:''' "Otherwise, you will be required to stay in the vicinity of the arena to receive treatment. All candidates must undergo re-examination, especially anyone who has come into contact with [[Abyss]]al forces!"
:'''Emergency Notice:''' "Of course, if you don't wish to undergo testing again, all you have to do is beat Miss [[Chasca]] in combat, and we'll consider you fighting fit!"
:'''Emergency Notice:''' "Can't quite manage that? Haha, then quit yapping and get your treatment sorted! Once treated, you'll be allowed to fly again."

===Flight Trial Notice===
<!--Likely only available after "The Rainbow Destined to Burn"-->
:'''Flight Trial Notice:''' "All candidates wishing to take part in the flight test must first clear mental aptitude and physical examinations before being allowed to practice take-offs."
:'''Flight Trial Notice:''' "Meanwhile, all flight-related training must be conducted under the protection and supervision of a tutor. Any unauthorized training will result in permanent loss of eligibility for flight trials."
:'''Flight Trial Notice:''' "Administrators reserve the right to terminate any training currently underway, and if a termination signal is received, please follow all instructions in returning to the arena."

===Flight Regulations===
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "8.{{sic}} In non-emergency situations, please follow the ground guides, keep to fixed flight paths, and take off and landings at safe speeds. Dangerous actions are strictly prohibited."
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "Note: 'The [[Saurian]] did it' shall not be considered an acceptable excuse. [[Qucusaur]]s have an innate capacity for safe flight, but humans do not."

===Flight Regulations===
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "26: Please do not carry any valuables with you when flying to avoid dropping them."
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "If a similar situation occurs, please ask any flying squad for assistance."
:'''Chief's Message:''' "Due to the variance in difficulty involved in finding different items, our flying squads cannot guarantee definite retrieval of any lost belongings. Please pay close attention and follow all regulations."

===Flight Regulations===
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "34: Those who release junk while airborne will be subject to lifetime imprisonment."
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "For the safety of everyone, nobody is allowed to release any airborne objects around the trial grounds without obtaining prior approval. This includes kites, balloons, and birds!"
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "In a previous case, someone released a balloon and it impacted a Qucusaurus' flight path. If it weren't for a flying squad member administering timely assistance, the results would have been disastrous!"
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "The chief has also stated that safety is paramount. This kind of thing cannot happen again. So follow the rules, everyone!"

===Flight Regulations===
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "37: For safety reasons, please do not carry any creatures with you incapable of flight."
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "Note: In theory, humans are also a species without plumage who walk on two legs, and who are incapable of flight."
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "Further Note: 'My friend has a wind glider &mdash; that totally counts as having flight capabilities' shall not be considered a valid excuse."

===Flight Regulations===
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "52: Do not shout or scream while flying, and do not make strange noises."
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "The former will disorient other people (or Saurians), while the latter may be misinterpreted as an instruction by Qucusaurs, thus creating unnecessary safety hazards."
:'''Flight Regulations:''' "Note: 'I'm singing' shall not be considered a valid excuse for making strange noises. The definition of what constitutes a 'song' here shall be left to the majority consensus of people (or Saurians)."
