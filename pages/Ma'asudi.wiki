==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ma'asudi:''' It's time to hire new mercenaries for the next study... Another bill to pay.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Ma'asudi knows)
:::'''Ma'asudi:''' Hearing that I'm making models, a kindhearted local told me there's a place nearby where I can find Crystal Ores. They also said there are some blue ores that look special.
:::'''Ma'asudi:''' Unfortunately, despite that the ores there are of good quality, they are not suitable for my current research.
:::'''Ma'asudi:''' You need ores? Head in this direction and you'll find them.
:;(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Ma'asudi knows)
:::'''Ma'asudi:''' Sorry, I've been busy recently, worrying all day about the funding for my research. I haven't been paying much attention to what's happening around me...
:{{DIcon}} Are you caught short financially?
::'''Ma'asudi:''' Sort of. Instead of saying I don't have enough money, it's more accurate to say that the allocated funds are always delayed.
::'''Ma'asudi:''' Because I travel to the desert frequently to investigate the ruins mechanisms, I've already taken up residence in Caravan Ribat just to save on the travel costs.
::'''Ma'asudi:''' Even so, I still have to pay out of pocket.
::'''Ma'asudi:''' ...Is the Akademiya doing this to warn us against going deep into the desert?
::'''Ma'asudi:''' *sigh* Maybe I'm just overthinking and the Akademiya is just too poor. If I'd known this would happen, I would have taken a job for the fortifications instead.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ma'asudi:''' See you. I hope the funds will be delivered without a hitch.
