==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Put off the first "wicked flame")
::'''A Strange Voice:''' Ah, a brave Nara! Could you help us chase the bad things that want to taint this place? I will have treasures for you...
;(Put off the second "wicked flame")
::'''A Strange Voice:''' [[Old Vanarana]] has regained vigor. Soon, it will become a paradise once more.
;(Put off the third "wicked flame")
::'''A Strange Voice:''' I dreamed of a Nara just like you... Though it could have been another [[Aranara]]... We defeated [[The_Withering|Marana]] together. It feels like it happened so long ago...
::'''A Strange Voice:''' Sorry. My memories are jumbled up with many others. I cannot be sure about many things.
;(Put off the fourth "wicked flame")
::'''A Strange Voice:''' The evil that haunts this land has been driven out by us... By Nara and Aranara.
::'''A Strange Voice:''' But evil wishes to return. Wishes for Marana to return. That is why they light wicked fires.
;(Put off the fifth "wicked flame")
::'''A Strange Voice:''' But you are here. So Marana can be stopped. The black sky, the lifeless land, and the stinking water of death will not return.
;(Put off the sixth "wicked flame")
::'''A Strange Voice:''' Hmm. I feel it. The bad guy's leader is by the [[Statue of The Seven|Stone Dendro Archon]].
::'''A Strange Voice:''' The bad guys' power and Marana have the same source. Stop them, brave Nara.
;(Put off the seventh "wicked flame")
::'''Abyss Lector, Servant of Flame:''' You bothersome gnat. Do you really believe that the memories of the world's depths can thus be reversed or changed?
::'''A Strange Voice:''' No. We do not forget. But we will not let these memories return to the earth.
::'''Abyss Lector, Servant of Flame:''' Hah. So you are not alone! Right, then. After I dispose of you, I suppose I must then burn those new-budded sprouts to the ground. Annoyances, all of them!
;(Defeat the '''Abyss Lector, Servant of Flame''')
::'''A Strange Voice:''' Thank you. In time, Vanarana will return to being a paradise. Nara and Aranara will walk hand in hand, just as we did before.
::'''A Strange Voice:''' Nara (Traveler)... Yes, that is your name. We will surely meet again!
::'''A Strange Voice:''' Before then, please, do not lose your courage, your gentleness, and do not lose your golden glory...
