{{Lang|'''Guhua'''|zh=古华|zh_rm=Gǔhuá}} is a historical and mythological figure in [[Liyue]]. It is believed he was an [[adeptus]] who, at the end of his journey, ascended and became a star in the midst of a purple haze at [[Huaguang Stone Forest]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Rainslasher|Description|note=Chinese}}</ref>

While the [[Guhua Clan]] is named after him, he has no direct relation to it; its original form, the Guhua Brotherhood, was established by someone close to Guhua to honor him.

The [[Rainslasher]] is said to have been his weapon when he still roamed [[Teyvat]].

==Trivia==
*The figure shares his name with the Chinese name of the weapon [[Prototype Archaic]] {{Lang|zh=试作古华|zh_rm=Shìzuò Gǔhuá|zh_tl=Prototype Guhua}}. The weapon is simply given the name "Guhua" in its lore description.
===Etymology===
*Guhua {{Lang|zh=古华}} translates to "ancient splendor."
