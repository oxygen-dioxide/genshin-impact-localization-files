{{Quest Description|Wouldn't it be great if you could catch some fish for your [[Saurian]] buddy...? Ace Angler Paimon, you're up!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On obtaining quest)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' What's up, {{Little One}}? You wanna go hang out on the beach? Hehe, let's go check it out then!
----
;(Approach Little One)
:'''Paimon:''' This shallow water beach looks great! It's warm, bright, and there are fishing rods set up here. Maybe this would make a good fishing spot!
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't we try fishing here?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe I'll catch myself another travel guide...
:'''Paimon:''' No way, Paimon vetoes that idea. Besides, there's only one Paimon, and you already caught her!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's talking about fish-fishing! It's been a while since we last ate fish you caught and cooked yourself... Plus, it's about time you gave {{Little One}} a taste of your culinary wizardry!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, it's all for poor old {{Little One}}, y'know...
:{{DIcon}} Then why don't you get involved too, Paimon...
::{{DIcon}} How about... you do the fishing this time, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? You want P&mdash;Paimon... to do the fishing?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:{{DIcon}} All for poor old {{Little One}}, eh?
:'''Paimon:''' How... How could you, catching Paimon out with her own words like that!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, alright then... But be warned, Paimon has no idea what she'll catch, if anything!
:'''Paimon:''' Plus, before that... Ace Angler Paimon needs a nice, tidy environment to work her magic in. What if the line gets snagged on all that junk floating around in the water?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's tidy up the area a bit first!
----
:'''Paimon:''' All these Wooden Planks and Wooden Crates are in the way. Break them quietly though &mdash; don't scare the fish away!

;(Destroy the crate floating near a raft)
:'''Paimon:''' ...Wow, who'd have thought there'd be a slime in there too!
----
;(After cleaning up the waters)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew, nice and tidy at last... G&mdash;Guess it's time for Paimon to get started with the fishing!
:'''Paimon:''' Just you wait and see, Paimon's gonna catch a big one!
:{{Black Screen|Sadly, the surface stays as still as a mirror, without a ripple in sight.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh... Is there something wrong with the water here? The fish don't seem to want to come out, at all!
:{{DIcon}} So close, hehe...
::'''Paimon:''' So close! Yet... so far. Ugh, why does it feel like this is gonna take forever...
::'''Paimon:''' It's a bit early to be getting Paimon's hopes up!
:{{DIcon}} It won't be long, trust me! Just stay cool!
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, you're probably right. After all, once the bites start coming, it all happens so fast. Like when you go to pick a [[Sweet Flower]], but it turns out to be a [[Whopperflower]]...
::'''Paimon:''' All you gotta do is stay focused and wait... and wait...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr...
:{{DIcon}} You've got it! You've got it!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, stop being such a distraction... Jeez!
:'''Paimon:''' Ehh!? We've got a bite, we've got a bite! Time to reel it in and see what Paimon's caught!
:'''Paimon:''' What the... that's not a fish, it's a bottle! And it's even tied to one of the wooden planks at the fishing spot... Ugh, well, the fact that you always catch strange things too makes Paimon feel a little better, {{Traveler}}...
:{{DIcon}} You seem to be able to catch anything... but fish.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, you catch weird stuff all the time too! Anyway, seeing as Paimon already caught it, we might as well take a look at what's inside...
::{{Readable|title=Note in a Drift Bottle
|text=<!--
-->(There are pieces of paper scattered in the bottle. They seem to be messages between two people, one responding to the other. One person's handwriting is sloppy, and the other's script is composed.)<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->(Sloppy handwriting) "My dear friend! You-know-who in my household is being really strict, so I'll leave the fishing gear with you for now. Next time we go fishing, let's set up a time, and I'll make an excuse to sneak out. Remember! Do NOT come to the door and ask for me."<br><!--
-->(Composed handwriting) "Message received."<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->(Sloppy handwriting) "Tomorrow morning, the usual spot. I've already set out the bait."<br><!--
-->(Composed handwriting) "Message received."<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->(Sloppy handwriting) "My dear friend! Forgive me, I'm getting a bit old and my vision's getting dim. Yesterday, I even forgot the way home, and had to have someone ask you to come to the [[Golden Dusk]] and pick me up, after all, I can't let anyone in my family know about us fishing... Alas, people are so silly..."<br><!--
-->(Composed handwriting) "So you really forgot the way, and it wasn't that you just wanted to show me the giant fish you caught, right?"<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->(Composed handwriting) "You really forgot the way, right?"<br><!--

-->(The rest of the papers are soaked, and are completely illegible...)}}
:'''Paimon:''' Could it have been these two that left behind that pile of stuff just now? People who are this obsessed with fishing are... pretty scary, huh...
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like they're using this bottle to pass messages to one another... We'd better throw it back.
:'''Paimon:''' Aaaanyway, Paimon has a funny feeling that it'll definitely be a fish next time!
:{{Black Screen|The rod suddenly drops downwards and starts being violently tugged.<br>Seems like something big and heavy deep down below has taken the bait...}}
:'''Paimon:''' A bite, at last! Must be one heckuva fish... Up you come, you big lump!
:{{DIcon}} That's right, you big lump! Up you come!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' R&mdash;Rawr!
:{{Black Screen|Seeing Paimon struggling,<br>you and {{Little One}} grab hold of her...<br>But the line is being pulled with such unstoppable force...}}
:{{Black Screen|Finally, with a mighty plop, the fish escapes...}}
:'''Paimon:''' *sobs* That must have been a huge one, otherwise it would never have gotten away!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, so annoying... Huh? It's still swimming around near the surface! Seriously!?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawrr&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' No no no, the sea's too dangerous! And you'll never catch up with it anyway...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr...
:'''Paimon:''' If only we could find a way to catch that fish, {{Traveler}}...
----
:'''Paimon:''' Over there, over there! Don't let it get away!

;(Talk to Little One, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Yikes, that's one strong fish. How's it still able to swim so fast, even after such a long struggle...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawrrr...
:'''Paimon:''' No worries, {{Traveler}}'ll definitely be able to catch it again!

;(Approach the fleeing fish)
:'''Paimon:''' Ahhhh, almost caught up! We were so close...

;(Catch the fish)
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Gotcha!
:'''Paimon:''' Ooooh, gotcha! Hehe, let's bring this fish back, shall we?
----
:'''Paimon:''' Tada! What did Paimon tell ya? If anyone could get the better of this slippery customer, it'd be {{Traveler}}!
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of skills, if we just threw in all the bait and let the fish get so full that they turned over and floated up to the surface... that would still count as "fishing," right?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrar... Rawr...
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, you think so too, don't you, {{Little One}}? Paimon can tell just from the way your eyes are twinkling! Hehe, let's give it a try next time...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawrrr...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a sec, it's not done yet! We have to wait for {{Traveler}} to finish cooking it first!
:{{Black Screen|Once the fish is finished grilling, everyone sits down and eats their fill.}}
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Wah... Even as Grilled Fish goes, that was something special. You can really tell that Paimon was the one who caught it, hehe!
:{{DIcon}} Great job, Paimon! You're in charge of fishing from here on out!
:'''Paimon:''' Uhhh... *sigh*
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, there's no such thing as a free lunch, y'know, {{Little One}}! You'll have to help out too next time &mdash; if you want any fish, that is!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrawr?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, look who's playing dumb now!
