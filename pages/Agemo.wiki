==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Agemo:''' Hello! There aren't any matches on right now, so if you're looking for takeout, you'll have to go find Mr. [[Cipac]]. I just take care of deliveries.
:{{DIcon}} So you're the take-out person?
::'''Agemo:''' Yeah, but strictly speaking, I'm only on duty when there are matches taking place in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame.
::'''Agemo:''' Some spectators wear themselves out with all that cheering, jeering, and jumping around, so it's only natural they start wishing they had something to eat or drink.
::'''Agemo:''' That's where I come in, moving around the stands, taking orders, then running off to buy and deliver their stuff.
::'''Agemo:''' The spectators don't need to pay me any extra &mdash; Mr. Cipac pays me a regular wage.
::'''Agemo:''' And when there aren't any matches on, like now, I get to rest.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Sounds like a lot of strenuous physical labor.
::'''Agemo:''' Exactly! It's a race against time, day in and day out, to keep the food from going cold and soft.
::'''Agemo:''' Fortunately, I'm good with directions &mdash; never missed a delivery, ever!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Contention|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you, then.
::'''Agemo:''' See you later.
