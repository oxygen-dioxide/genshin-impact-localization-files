|[https://youtu.be/XYumEcnxfKQ Tales Told by the Wind]<br />feat. [[Barbara]]
|November 8, 2020

|January 19, 2021
|O watcher of the night, forget not the splendor of the dawn.<br />O ye who contend with evildoers, sway not from the path of righteousness.<br />On this long path under the faint light of dawn...<br />Even the herald of daybreak once lingered, lost in thought...

|The soft breeze ruffles the twigs and branches, and they sway back and forth in a lush symphony of sound.<br />The air brims over with a bard's voice, singing slowly of bygone days and azure skies.<br />The wind of freedom that penetrates the forest... What sort of song is it weaving this time?

|[https://youtu.be/SoZNz4KX8WA Where All Ships Dock]<br />feat. [[Keqing]]
|February 17, 2021
|A golden vision for the future must reach far beyond the horizon, for an ocean of wealth is formed from many tiny streams.<br />While the rest in the city relax and enjoy the peace and prosperity, one tireless innovator ponders a question:<br />When these shores finally recede into the murky depths of history... How will the bygone currents of yesterday drive the burgeoning waves of tomorrow?

|June 9, 2021
|The crimson sun tiptoes around stealthily, all for an escape to the summer outdoors.<br />The explosives expert looks up and glances around, searching for the treasure that belongs exclusively to the Spark Knight — to her.<br />Unfortunately, that means that the fish swimming leisurely in the clear stream are in for another day of mayhem.

|Arataki Itto's life is very simple. He does as he pleases and works one day before taking three days off.<br />Arataki Itto's life is also very complex. After all, anyone who attracts so much attention would find it difficult to enjoy a moment of peace and quiet.
