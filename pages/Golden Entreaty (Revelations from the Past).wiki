|description  = A white disc retrieved from the ruins of the [[Sage of the Stolen Flame]]. It is one of the essential tokens required to journey to the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] and remove the "Flamelord's Blessing" from the [[Little One|little Tepetlisaur]]'s back. [[Iridescent Inscription|Golden inscriptions]] are etched into the surface of the white disc, and when touched, one can sense the intricate patterns pulsating as if imbued with life.
