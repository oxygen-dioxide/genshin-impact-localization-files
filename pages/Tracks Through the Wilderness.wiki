;(Approach Chasca)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hmm? Ah, {{Traveler}} and Paimon... You came...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup! And it looks like we made it just in time! Although... can't say the same for the [[qucusaur]]s. Bit of a low turnout, huh?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yeah... You'll see why soon enough.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Alright, get ready! Three, two, one... fly!
:{{Color|menu|Everyone manages to fly up into the sky on their Phlogiston Wings...}}

:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 zhunan 01.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' I feel light as a feather... Haha, I'm flying without a qucusaur!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 pachacuti 01.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' These Phlogiston Wings are awesome!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the... What's going on!?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can barely believe her eyes... How did they fly all on their own?
:{{DIcon}} What happened while we were gone?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The merchants we ran into that day were selling a product called "Phlogiston Wings."
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It's a flying machine worn on the back. To operate it, you just use a hand-held trackball that controls the flow of [[Gaseous Phlogiston|gaseous phlogiston]].
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's incredible...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yeah. If our tribe &mdash; well, if Natlan mass-adopted this technology, it would revolutionize our mobility and responsiveness in times of crisis...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Just think of the countless tragedies that could be averted.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 zhunan 02.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' I... I feel like I'm dreaming... Did I really just... fly on my own? Without the help of a qucusaur?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 coyllur 02.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' You'd better believe it! Plus, you just passed the flying trial! Right, Elder [[Allpa]]?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 allpa 02.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 zhunan 03.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' ...Elder Allpa?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 pachacuti 02.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' Um... Should this really count as a pass, if we did the trial using Phlogiston Wings?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 coyllur 03.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' Why not? The scoring rubric is about flying performance. It doesn't specifically say you have to ride a qucusaur, does it?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 pachacuti 03.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' Maybe, but... I mean, even Chasca had to ride a qucusaur in her trial, right? And the whole point of the trial is to test both your flying technique, and your ability to work with a saurian companion.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 coyllur 04.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' Well, if we can fly by ourselves... maybe we don't to test the latter anymore.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 allpa 03.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Chasca, {{Traveler}}, what are your thoughts on this new invention?
:{{DIcon}} It's a good innovation. The sooner it's widely adopted, the better.
::{{A|vo qsklq003 2 coyllur 05a 1.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' You see! Even {{Traveler}} agrees!
:{{DIcon}} It's an unknown quantity. You should use it with caution.
::{{A|vo qsklq003 2 pachacuti 04b 1.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' Right? That's what I think, too...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hmm... I agree that they have strategic value. But I don't think it makes any sense to evaluate candidates by the current testing standards if they're using Phlogiston Wings.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 zhunan 04.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' ...!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 coyllur 06.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' Whyyy? [[Zhunan]] finally mustered the courage to go through with this, and now you're saying it doesn't count!?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We don't have any experience using these wings in battle, nor is it immediately obvious how to incorporate them into the existing systems in our tribe.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Taking a longer-term perspective, I think we need to start by getting thoroughly acquainted with how these things work. Then we can develop a new trial format with new assessment criteria, tailored to candidates using the Phlogiston Wings.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 allpa 04.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Mmm... You all raise valid points. But Chasca, while your proposal sounds perfectly reasonable, it would probably take years to put it into practice.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 allpa 05.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' We lost so many people in that war... These Phlogiston Wings could be exactly what we need to strengthen our forces and boost morale in this trying time.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 allpa 06.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' And as for real-world battle experience... There will be plenty of opportunities to gain that. I have high hopes for you, Zhunan.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 zhunan 05.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' Huh...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 coyllur 07.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' Hey... Stop staring into space! Say "thank you"!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 zhunan 06.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' Oh, uh &mdash; thank you! Thank you, Elder Allpa!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 allpa 07.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' You have nothing to thank me for. Remember... the way you got your wings back was by relying on yourself.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 warmi 01.ogg}} '''Warmi:''' ...Elder Allpa! Bad news &mdash; qucusaurs are attacking the merchants again!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 allpa 08.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Again? Okay, everyone stay put while I&mdash; Hmm?
:{{Color|menu|Chasca runs out without saying a word.}}
:{{A|vo qsklq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Chasca...

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why did Chasca rush off like that? And then Elder Allpa and the others, too... Anyway, let's go see what this is all about!
----
;(Approach the caravan)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 youngmerchants 01.ogg}} '''Young Merchant:''' It's back... It found us again!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 elderlymerchants 01.ogg}} '''Elderly Merchant:''' Run! Get out of here!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 coya 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 isidore 01.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Curses... She's really riled up this time!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 isidore 02.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Hey, stop running! We'll never outrun a creature with wings! Get back here and let's fight!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 coya 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Stop, all of you!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 elderlymerchants 02.ogg}} '''Elderly Merchant:''' ...Chasca! Wonderful! Quick, get rid of that thing...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...
:'''???:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 youngmerchants 02.ogg}} '''Young Merchant:''' Uhh... What's going on? Why isn't she doing anything?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' So it really is you...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Sister.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, "sister"? That qucusaur is Chasca's sister?
:'''???:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 coya 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 coya 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Cheep!
:{{Color|menu|With an angry shriek, the Qucusaurus soars up into the air.}}
:{{A|vo qsklq003 4 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Coya, wait!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is Chasca gonna be okay? Should we go check on her?

;(Talk to [[Coyllur]] or Zhunan, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq003 coyllur 01.ogg}} '''Coyllur:''' What was wrong with that qucusaur? Why was it so aggressive?
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq003 zhunan 01.ogg}} '''Zhunan:''' If we just let it escape back into the wild, who's to say it won't attack again?

;(Talk to Allpa or [[Isidore]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq003 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Is everyone alright?
:{{A|vo dialog qsklq003 isidore 01.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' We're okay, no serious injuries... Thank goodness you all got here just in time.

;(Talk to Chasca)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chasca... A&mdash;Are you okay?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Phew... I'm fine, sorry for making you worry.
:{{DIcon}} You're not going to keep following her?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' No point. She's an expert at hiding her tracks. Once she's shaken you off, you'll never catch up to her.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...At least, I always used to lose to her at hide-and-seek when we were kids.
:{{DIcon}} When you were kids?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Well, yeah. You know I was raised by qucusaurs. Anyway, she and I grew up in the nest together... her name's Coya, and she's my "big sister."
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We played together all the time, chasing each other through treetops, or mountaintops. It felt like it would go on that way forever... Until the day I was sent back to live with the humans.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Not all qucusaurs are friendly towards people. Coya, for instance &mdash; she's fine with me, because we grew up around each other, but she's not fond of other humans.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' When "Mom" decided to send me away, Coya strongly protested, and after I left, she became more and more reluctant to interact with humans...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe she thinks that... humans stole you away from her?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...It's a possibility. But in any case, we still stayed best friends at first.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I had a hard time adjusting to life in the tribe, so whenever something went wrong, I'd run off into the wild and vent to Coya.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so that's what Uncle [[Cusco]] was talking about. He said you seemed to prefer hanging out with [[saurian]]s to your own kind back then.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yeah, I did... but then gradually, everything changed. With a new mom and dad, a new tribe, and [[Chuychu]]...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I started getting curious about these humans, and made an effort to understand their behavior. The more time I spent with them, the less I spent with Coya...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' And then, one day... it was Coya's turn to leave the nest. She sought me out and asked if I was willing to leave the tribe and go live in the wilderness with her.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 13.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' As far as I can remember... That was the first time she ever approached a human settlement on purpose.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... how did you answer her?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 14.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Well, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you if I'd said yes.
:{{DIcon}} In other words, you turned her down?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 15.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' No, I... I was torn. On the one hand, I'd already made up my mind to embrace my new family, and accept my human identity.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 16.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' But I also knew that Coya wasn't a fan of humans, and I didn't want to disappoint her... *sigh* She took my hesitation as an answer.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 17.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' She saw it as a personal betrayal, threw a huge fit, and then flew off. We hadn't seen each other since... until today.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 18.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Not for lack of trying, though. I tried asking Mom where Coya's new nest was so I could talk things out with her. But Coya had already asked Mom not to tell me where she'd moved to.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 19.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It must be hard for Mom, being stuck between her two daughters, so I didn't press the issue, and I didn't go looking for her.
:{{DIcon}} But after today's events...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 20.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Mm, if things carry on like this, I need to make sure I find her before anyone else... Even if she doesn't want to see me.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 8 chasca 21.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' For now, let's bring the wounded back to the tribe, and see what [[Mutota]] and Elder Allpa have in mind.
----
;(Approach Mutota)
:{{Black Screen|After tending to the wounded, Mutota gathers everyone for a meeting...}}
:;(Nearby, a group of people talk about the recent attacks)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 pixica 01.ogg}} '''Pixica:''' ...So, I hear there's been another Qucusaur attack.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 huascar 01.ogg}} '''Huascar:''' Hah, I knew it! They're wild animals, and they can't be trusted!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 pachacuti 01.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' Hey! Show a little respect, the qucusaurs are our partners!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 huascar 02.ogg}} '''Huascar:''' Hmph, maybe in the flying squad, but they don't give a hoot about the rest of us!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 pixica 02.ogg}} '''Pixica:''' Well, now that we have the Phlogiston Wings... Do we even need the qucusaurs anymore?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 pachacuti 02.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' Are you kidding? How are we supposed to protect our tribe without them?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 pixica 03.ogg}} '''Pixica:''' ...I&mdash;I didn't mean it like that!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 huascar 03.ogg}} '''Huascar:''' Huh! "Protect our tribe"? Or are you just scared that your precious flying squad will lose its prestigious position?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 pachacuti 03.ogg}} '''Mukki:''' You take that back!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' *sigh* ...Things are changing so quickly...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Chasca, there's a conflict emerging there... aren't you going to nip it in the bud?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The whole tribe's talking about this now &mdash; breaking up a single fight won't solve anything. The real source of conflict here is the Phlogiston Wings... and what happened with Coya.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 mutota 02.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' On any other day, people would just brush this attack aside. After all, clashes between wild qucusaurs and humans are no more common than those between people.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 allpa 02.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' But now that the Phlogiston Wings have entered the equation, it's sparked a debate over whether our tribe needs the qucusaurs at all...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 mutota 03.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' I worry that we risk repeating the mistakes of the [[Cinder City]]... Back then, Lord [[Och-Kan]]'s hatred of the saurians nearly destroyed the peace forged by the [[Xbalanque|Pyro Archon]]...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 mutota 04.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Chasca, to prevent things from deteriorating further, I'd like to task you with restoring peace to the tribe.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I will.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 mutota 05.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' {{Traveler}}, you've already done so much for Natlan, and the Flower-Feather Clan has no right to ask more of you, but...
:{{DIcon}} Say no more. I'm in.
::{{DIcon}} Chasca is my friend.
:::{{A|vo qsklq003 9 chasca 03a 1.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Thank you.
::{{DIcon}} The Flower-Feather Tribe are my friends.
:::{{A|vo qsklq003 9 mutota 06b 1.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Heh... Looks like I was making a mountain out of a mole-hill.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And don't forget about Paimon! Just leave this to us.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 allpa 03.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...This whole situation has unfolded so quickly that it's put us on a back foot. To tell the truth, it makes me a little suspicious...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You think someone might have orchestrated all this?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 allpa 04.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' It's possible... Leave it with me. I'll look into it.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 allpa 05.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Also, Chasca... Could you try to keep a low profile while you're out there digging around? We don't want to give our hand away.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I'll do my best.
:;(The Traveler, Paimon, and Chasca set off)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... So where should we start?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' This all began with Coya's attacks. If we can find out what led her to do it, that should give us something to work with.
:{{DIcon}} But will she even talk to us?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Unlikely. Given how she reacted when I showed up, I don't think she's forgiven me.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 9 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' If you want to resolve a conflict through dialogue, sometimes you need a third-party facilitator... Let's go see my "mom."

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, so this is where you used to live as a child?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Mm-hmm... When I was little, we used to do this thing where I'd jump from the top of this tree, and Coya would fly over from the platform and catch me in midair.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Or sometimes, we'd both fly from the treetop together, then after some aerial maneuvering, she'd throw me up onto that platform.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' After we got a bit older, we went to the nearby shores looking for even greater heights...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah, stop! You're gonna give Paimon a heart attack...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Oh, really? I just thought it made a fun story...
:{{DIcon}} I liked it.
::{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 05a 1.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Then I'll share some more with you when there's time. Anyway... back to the matter at hand.
:{{DIcon}} It's a bit scary...
::{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 05b 1.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' What, you too? Alright, fine... let's focus on the matter at hand.

:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hey, Momma Bird, I'm back. My last visit was only a week ago, wasn't it? See, I visit you more than I visit Papa Cusco.

:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, this is my Mom. Her name is... "Chimpu." In the human tongue, anyway.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chimpu 03.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' Cheep!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... hi!
:{{DIcon}} So you understand saurian language?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' No, not really... I don't speak it as such, but I can sort of get the gist &mdash; although, only with Mom and Coya, since I spent my formative years with them.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Even then, it's basically a best-guess based on their sounds, body language, and expressions. Seems to work about nine times out of ten, anyway.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' As for whether Mom understands me, I can't always tell. But somehow, we still manage to communicate... Call it the family bond, I guess.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chimpu 04.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' Cheep?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Don't worry, I'm doing well. But... I think Coya might be in some trouble.
:{{Black Screen|Chasca explains the situation to Chimpu through a series of gestures...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 13.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...I know she's never been a fan of humans, but she's never deliberately attacked them before, either. What's behind this sudden change?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chimpu 05.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does, um... Auntie Chimpu know anything?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 14.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Doesn't look like it. Coya hasn't visited her in a long time.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 15.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Then, could you please tell me where she's living nowadays? I really need to talk to her.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 16.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' If this animosity between her and the tribe continues, then... the next time there's an incident, I don't know if I'll make it there in time.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chimpu 06.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chimpu 07.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' ...Cheep.
:{{DIcon}} What did she say?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 17.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...She said she'll take us there.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 10 chasca 18.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Thank you, Mom.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is a really remote location... Guess she was trying to get as far away from humans as possible.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chimpu 01.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' ...Cheep.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...We stay here? Mm... Okay, got it.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, Mom says we should stay out of sight for now. She'll talk to Coya first.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Coya is very hostile toward humans right now, so if we show up unannounced, it might just make things worse.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
:;(Coya lands while the group remains out of sight)
:'''Coya:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chimpu 02.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' ...Cheep?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 coya 02.ogg}} '''Coya:''' ...Cheep!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chimpu 03.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhhh... Any idea what they're saying?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hmm... Sounds like things are more complicated than I imagined.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...There's evidence in this area suggesting that Coya might have been the victim of a human attack.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 coya 03.ogg}} '''Coya:''' ...Cheep.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chimpu 04.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' Cheep!?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' No...!
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It's [[Chime]], Coya's child... the attackers kidnapped her!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' "They came over the sea... under the cover of night... and they took Chime."
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the heck? Who would do such a thing!?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 11 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' "I searched day and night... and finally found them..."
:{{DIcon}} When she says "them"...
:{{DIcon}} Does she mean...

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 01.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' D&mdash;Don't come any closer, or I'll... Uhh, go, Phlogiston Wings, take me outta here! ...Aah!

:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (This is bad... Mom and Coya are already injured, and if that thing explodes right next to them...)

:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 04.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' That was too close... I thought I was gonna die...

:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 05.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Eek!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Answer us honestly. Were you the ones who attacked Coya before?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 06.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' I, um... No, it was, it was...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 coya 01.ogg}} '''Coya:''' ...Cheep.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Well, she says it was you.
:{{DIcon}} If you still want to deny it...
:{{DIcon}} We have other ways of making you talk.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Just tell me. Who sent you here?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 07.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' I&mdash;It was Tepal! He told us to catch all the wild qucusaurs we can find!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 08.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' And... he also said that this qucusaur has become a thorn in his side... so it needs dealing with urgently...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' "Tepal"? Huh, sounds familiar... But where from...?
:{{DIcon}} So, where is he now?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 09.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Um... He tends to send his orders in writing...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 10.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' He pretty much never communicates with us in person. When he does, he wears a mask to hide his face...
:<gallery widths="350">

:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 11.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' And whenever we trade qucusaurs for Phlogiston Wings, we deal with his henchmen.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you didn't even make those wings!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 12.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' All we did was slap some labels on them and transport them over here, to make them look like they're imported...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...To make it harder to trace their origins.
:{{DIcon}} Why does he want you to catch qucusaurs?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 13.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Uh... I don't know, honest!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Well, that's mighty convenient, huh? What about if I held a gun to your head, would that change your answer?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 14.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' N&mdash;No need! I'm sorry, I'll tell you everything I know!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 15.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Tepal doesn't tell us much, but he's always stresses that he wants them alive... So that gives us some clues...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 16.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' This is just a best guess, of course, but we suspect that the gaseous phlogiston stored in the trackballs... is drawn directly from the qucusaurs.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 coya 02.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Easy now, you're still injured... Hey, keep talking.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 17.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Yes Ma'am... So, the gaseous phlogiston has to be highly refined in order to power the Phlogiston Wings. The slightest imperfection can have disastrous consequences, as you just witnessed...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 18.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' But the qucusaurs are have a natural ability to process gaseous phlogiston, so... if you use them as an intermediary, then...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 coya 03.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 13.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' That's enough... So, the qucusaurs you took. Where are they now?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 19.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Uh... Tepal should have them... But no one knows where he's based apart from him and his henchmen.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 20.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' We've tried looking for it ourselves. Even followed them a few times. But we always end up losing track of them...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Random thought: Maybe they're hiding up in the sky...?
:{{DIcon}} I guess this means we can't go after the ringleader yet.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 14.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Tepal... Tepal... I'm sure I've heard that name. Maybe it was...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 01.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Chasca! {{Traveler}}!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That voice! It's Allpa!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 15.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Elder Allpa? What brings you all the way out here?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 02.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Well, I was patrolling nearby when I heard the sound of an explosion... What's going on?
:{{DIcon}} Let me fill you in...
:{{Black Screen|You explain Tepal's scheme to Allpa...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 03.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' I don't believe it...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 16.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Elder Allpa, does the name "Tepal" ring a bell to you? I feel like I've seen it written down before... maybe in a list of candidates for the flying trials.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So he's a member of your tribe, then?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 17.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' No... If he was a member of the Flower-Feather Clan, I'd definitely know him.
:{{DIcon}} Shall we head back to the tribe and do some investigating?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 04.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 05.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...Now that you mention it, I do remember a young man from outside our tribe who came to participate in our flying trials once.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 06.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' You were away on a mission at the time, which is probably why you don't remember him.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 07.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' He was a craftsman from the [[Children of Echoes]], but he'd always dreamed of soaring the skies. So he wanted to join our flying squad.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 18.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The Children of Echoes? That's rare.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 08.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' But despite his best efforts, he unfortunately failed to pass the trial and gain the qucusaurs' approval.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 09.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' In the end, he went wingless, and returned dejected to the Children of Echoes.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wingless, huh... Maybe he invented the Phlogiston Wings to get revenge on the qucusaurs?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 10.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Perhaps... or maybe it's simply his way of dealing with his regrets over his past flying endeavors.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 19.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Either way, it doesn't excuse his abuse of the qucusaurs. I'm gonna take these guys back and expose the truth to the tribe. It's time for this conflict to end.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 21.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' Aah...!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 11.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Easy, Chasca. Remember what I said about keeping a low profile?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 12.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' The ringleader still hasn't shown himself, and this man's allegation about powering the Phlogiston Wings with qucusaurs is only speculation.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 13.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Bringing these men to the tribe now won't win over any current supporters of the Phlogiston Wings. In fact, it may even escalate the conflict further.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 14.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' ...After all, many are mistrustful of the qucusaurs after recent events.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 20.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Is that why Tepal waited until now to try to capture my sister?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 isidore 22.ogg}} '''Isidore:''' I&mdash;I don't know! I mean, he did tell us to spread negative rumors about the qucusaurs, and slip some Mora to anyone opposed to them, but...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Coya only attacked humans because they stole her child!
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 15.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Nevertheless, we will be hard-pressed to change people's minds while emotions are running high &mdash; unless we have irrefutable evidence...
:{{DIcon}} ...You mean, we need to catch Tepal himself?
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 16.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' Bravo, my thoughts exactly. In the meantime, leave these men with me &mdash; I'll escort them back to the tribe.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 allpa 17.ogg}} '''Allpa:''' I'll take the other members of their crew into custody, too. They won't get another chance to stir up trouble.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 21.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Fair enough... I guess finding Tepal is gonna be the key to resolving this conflict. Let's hope the Children of Echoes have some info on him.
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 coya 04.ogg}} '''Coya:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 22.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Sorry, whatever it is, it'll have to wait till this has all blown over. I have to fix this situation before it spirals out of control...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chimpu 01.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' Cheep...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chasca 23.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Mom, Sis... rest up, and get well soon. I gotta fly.
:{{Black Screen|Everyone departs, leaving only Chimpu and Coya...}}
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 coya 05.ogg}} '''Coya:''' ...
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chimpu 02.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' (...If you're worried, go ahead and follow her.)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 chimpu 03.ogg}} '''Chimpu:''' (Don't worry about me. Mom can take care of herself.)
:{{A|vo qsklq003 13 coya 06.ogg}} '''Coya:''' (...Got it.)
