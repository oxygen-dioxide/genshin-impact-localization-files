==Trivia==
* The level names of this domain are all "Elegiac Rime" which likely refers to the Ley Line Disorder that inflicts Sheer Cold to you and covers various floor tiles with an effect that increases the Sheer Cold. Rime is a type of ice formed when water freezes very quickly upon contact with an object. Elegiac is the adjective of the word "elegy", a song of mourning. Prior to [[Version 2.7]], the domain was misspelled as "{{sic|Elegaic Rime}}."
* This is the only domain where the domain entrance is tilted.
