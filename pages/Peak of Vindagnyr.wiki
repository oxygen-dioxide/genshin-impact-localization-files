But after the nail that froze the skies over descended upon this mountain, the festive site where priests ascended to face the heavens can no longer hear its voice, nor will those priests ever return again.

==Trivia==
* The domains are all named "Elegiac Rime," in reference to the Ley Line Disorder that inflicts Sheer Cold and covers various floor tiles with an effect that increases the Sheer Cold. "Elegiac" is the adjective form of "elegy," a song of mourning, while "rime" is a type of ice formed when water freezes very quickly upon contact with an object.
* This is the only domain with a tilted domain entrance.
