|description    = In Natlan, trees tend not to be named for their appearance, but according to the ways in which their wood is normally used.<br>Fire plays an immensely significant role in Natlan's society, serving not only as a basic light source, but also as a spiritual symbol of profound import. Maintaining an indoor flame has become a daily necessity, requiring fuel that is readily available, safe to burn, and produces minimal smoke for an easier cleanup. Low-lying, yellow-crowned shrubs, widespread across Natlan, fit this role perfectly. Their relatively dry trunks ignite easily and emit a subtle fragrance with natural aromatherapeutic effects when burned, earning them the nickname "Fragrant Firewood."
