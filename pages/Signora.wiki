'''La Signora''',<ref name="Ending Note" /> also known as '''Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter''' and by her codename "'''The Fair Lady'''," was the Eighth of the [[Fatui Harbingers|Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]. She is the first Harbinger to appear in the game and was formerly the Crimson Witch of Flame.

Ultimately, she lost to the [[Traveler]] in their [[Duel Before the Throne|duel before the Raiden Shogun's throne]] and was executed by the [[Musou no Hitotachi]].

==Profile==
As a Fatui Harbinger, Signora possesses great power, both in combat and in diplomatic relations.

Signora wields a Cryo Delusion<ref name="Funerary Mask" /> and can also use fire-based powers.<ref name="signora boss fight">{{Ref/Domain|Narukami Island: Tenshukaku}}</ref><!-- not confirmed to be from a Vision -->

===Appearance===
Signora is a tall woman with pale skin, platinum-blonde hair, and light gray eyes. Some of her hair is tied into two rose-shaped buns at the back of her head. She wears a black earring on her left ear and a black mask that covers her right eye. She is seen with what appears to be a Catalyst hovering behind her right shoulder.

==Story==
===Life Before the Fatui===
Her origins are unknown, but she lived in Mondstadt roughly 500 years ago. As a maiden, she loved to sing and eventually fell in mutual love with [[Rostam]].<ref name="AS: DW">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Defender's Will}}</ref> She was accepted into [[Sumeru Akademiya]] and shortly before she left for her studies, Rostam gave her a special h<!-- intentionally lower-case -->ydro-timepiece<ref group="Note">'''EN:''' Hydro timepiece.<br>'''CN:''' {{zh|水时计|tl={{zh|水}}-timepiece.}}<br>Since the Chinese version does not differentiate "water" in a general sense and the element Hydro (both are represented by {{zh|水}}), it is not clear whether it was a water-powered timepiece or a Hydro-magic one.</ref> to keep track of the amount of time she would be away.<ref name="AS: CWoF Sands"/> She was likely an apprentice studying Pyro magic there,<ref name="AS: CWoF Circlet">{{Ref/Arti|Witch's Scorching Hat}}</ref> though what means she used to harness Pyro is unknown.<ref group="Note">[[Witch's Heart Flames]] says that the Crimson Witch of Flame turned herself into liquid fire and that the techniques for making liquid fire are now lost. This does not sound like usage of a Pyro Vision.</ref>

The [[cataclysm]] struck while she was in [[Sumeru]]. When she returned, she learned that Rostam had died in battle against the monsters. In her grief and rage, she decided to use "her life's flame" to cleanse "the world's crookedness,"<ref name="WL: EftE">{{Ref/Weapon|Elegy for the End|Lore}}</ref> becoming the Crimson Witch of Flame.<ref name="AS: CWoF Sands" /><ref name="AS: CWoF Flower"/> She was rumored to have abandoned her mortal body and instead let liquid fire flow through herself with an art that is now lost to history,<ref name="AS: CWoF Goblet">{{Ref/Arti|Witch's Heart Flames}}</ref><ref group="Note">'''EN:''' "Rumor told of how she sacrificed her mortal body to become the embodiment of liquid fire herself."<br>'''CN:''' {{zh|人们传说她放弃了人的血肉，体内奔流的是液态流火。|tl=People rumored that she had abandoned her human blood and flesh, and what flowed through her body was liquid flowing-fire.}}</ref> burning her own face and scarring her body in the process.<ref name="AS: CWoF Circlet" /><ref name="AS: PF Flower">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Stainless Bloom}}</ref> Although she only burned monsters and demons, she became feared by the people.<ref name="AS: CWoF Plume">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Witch's Ever-Burning Plume}}</ref>

===Recruitment into the Fatui===
Before she could be fully devoured by her own flames, [[Pierro]] found her and decided to make her an ally. She was given a Cryo [[Delusion]] to suppress her flames and became known as La Signora, the Eighth of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].<ref name="Funerary Mask" /><ref name="AS: PF Flower" /><ref name="Ashen Heart">{{Ref/Item|Ashen Heart}}</ref><ref name="Signora Archive">{{Ref/Enemy|Narukami Island: Tenshukaku}}</ref> In the process, she willingly cast aside and forgot her past, possibly with the help of her Delusion.<ref name="AS: PF Flower" /><ref name="Hellfire Butterfly">{{Ref/Item|Hellfire Butterfly}}</ref><ref name="Molten Moment">{{Ref/Item|Molten Moment}}</ref><ref group="Note">[[Stainless Bloom]]: "Then, let glacial ice take the place of my erased past [...]";<br>[[Hellfire Butterfly]]: "The seal of ice was broken under duress, and as her former will surged forth from its pale white prison and she remembered her old name once more, [...] she remembered her past, [...] she recalled the face of the person she could never meet again";<br>[[Molten Moment]]'s description contains dream imagery;<br>[[Funerary Mask]]: "The Fatui often face the world from behind their masks, and it is said that this is because all they once were mean nothing once they become Fatui, and thus must they forsake their true names and face alike." Though, this is symbolic rather than literal for most Fatui.</ref>

===In-Game===
Signora presumably arrived in [[Mondstadt]] before the [[Traveler]]'s arrival; her subordinates, such as [[Viktor]], were placed in various parts of the city and most of them resided in the [[Goth Grand Hotel]], which was rented out by her fellow Harbinger [[Pantalone]]. Based on the dialogue of the [[Fatui Pyro Agent]] guarding the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]], she ordered her subordinates to steal it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Chasing Shadows}}</ref>

Signora makes her first in-person appearance at the end of [[Song of the Dragon and Freedom|Act III]] of the [[Prologue]], after the party successfully restored [[Dvalin]], thwarted the [[Abyss Order]]'s plans, and returned the Holy Lyre der Himmel. Although [[Jean]] believed the Fatui's plans to take [[Barbatos]]' power and harm those close to him had been thwarted, this turns out to be far from the truth. Signora was aiming to draw out Barbatos himself, and with his return in the form of [[Venti]], she could now achieve her true objective: taking the Anemo Archon's [[Gnosis]]. To that end, she ambushed him and the Traveler outside the [[Mondstadt Cathedral]] with her subordinates, overpowering Venti with her Cryo Delusion's powers and letting her subordinates keep the Traveler pinned down. With her objective complete, Signora then departed with her subordinates and left both Venti and the Traveler unconscious, making sure to leave no evidence behind for the [[Knights of Favonius]] to conduct a serious investigation on.<ref name="Ending Note"/>

At the end of [[Chapter I]], Signora turns out to be the liaison between [[Zhongli]], the Geo Archon [[Morax]], and the [[Tsaritsa]]. [[Tartaglia]] had been dispatched to Liyue with the impression that he was to defeat Morax and take the Gnosis; however, it was actually part of Zhongli's plan to have Tartaglia cause chaos in Liyue and test the Liyue people and [[adepti]]'s ability to protect Liyue without his power. Satisfied with the proceedings, Zhongli handed over his Gnosis to Signora as per his contract with the Tsaritsa. With the Gnosis in her possession, she swiftly left alone for Snezhnaya after Tartaglia refused to join her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

When the Traveler arrived in [[Inazuma]], they found themselves stuck in [[Ritou]] like many other outlanders until they made contact with [[Hiiragi Chisato]]. She revealed that her father and head of the [[Kanjou Commission]], [[Hiiragi Shinsuke]], plotted with an unidentified "arrogant-sounding woman" to keep the Traveler stalled on Ritou. This woman turns out to be Signora, who had arrived at Inazuma with the intent of furthering their [[Delusion Factory]]'s productions, a job she later handed over to [[Scaramouche]],<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Skeletal Hat}}</ref> and obtaining the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s Gnosis.

The Traveler encountered Signora for a third time within [[Tenshukaku]] after following [[Kujou Sara]]'s rampage, only to find Sara lying defeated at Signora's feet. When the Traveler confronted Signora, the woman flaunts her status as a Snezhnayan diplomat and plays ignorant to all of the Fatui's plots on [[Inazuma]], including the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] and the distribution of [[Delusion]]s to members of the [[Watatsumi Army]], or otherwise dismisses the suffering that the Fatui caused both on Inazuma and in the previous two nations that they had encountered each other in. When Signora suggests that the Traveler could incite the Raiden Shogun's wrath for barging into Tenshukaku, the Traveler challenges Signora to a duel before the throne, which the Raiden Shogun approves. Confident in her ability to defeat the Traveler, Signora accepts.

During the duel, Signora finds her Cryo Delusion too inhibiting and deactivates it, transforming into the Crimson Witch of Embers.<ref group="Note">The Crimson Witch of Embers is the same person as the Crimson Witch of Flame(s). This is a deliberate title change in all languages; in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, she becomes the {{Lang|"Witch of Burnt-Out Flame"|zh=焚尽的炽炎魔女|ja=焚尽の灼炎魔女|ko=사그라든 화염의 마녀|sort=zh,ja,ko}}.<br>The title change likely indicates the strength of Signora's flames, as her flames have been suppressed for the last 500 years by her Cryo Delusion; [[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku#Boss Description|her boss description in the Archive]] indicates that her embers were once flames in both English and Chinese.<br>See [[#Trivia|Trivia]] for details as well as a full list of indicators that Signora is the Crimson Witch of Flame.</ref> Despite this, she loses the duel, returns to her normal appearance, and falls to her knees, considerably weakened from the fight. As per the rules of the duel, the defeated is formally executed by the Raiden Shogun's [[Musou no Hitotachi]]. In the face of her impending doom, Signora loses her cool and flies into hysterics before making a final lunge at the Raiden Shogun, only to be sliced by the Shogun's blade. Signora's body dissolves into ashes, which leaves the Traveler and [[Paimon]] greatly shaken.<ref group="Note">While all beings encountered as [[enemies]] disappear upon defeat, beings who are not encountered as enemies, such as those in cutscenes or those who become open world objects, may leave behind a corpse. Signora disintegrates into dust during a cutscene.</ref>

It later turns out that Signora's search for the Gnosis was in vain; [[Yae Miko]] reveals that [[Ei]] had given her the Gnosis centuries ago, after completing [[the Shogun]] and before entering the [[Plane of Euthymia]]. By the time Signora met the Shogun and dueled the Traveler, Miko had already exchanged the Gnosis for the Traveler's life, which had been at Scaramouche's mercy. Scaramouche, having obtained the "heart" he had long yearned for,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Bloom Times}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Song of Life}}</ref><ref group="Note">In the original Chinese text, the term "Gnosis" is {{zh|神之心|tl=Heart of God.}}</ref> abandoned the Fatui to pursue his own goals.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Away With Obsessions and Falsehood}}</ref>

Signora's death shocked many Fatui, who expressed surprise at her demise. Some of her subordinates in Inazuma remained to exact revenge on the Shogunate, while ones in other nations were recalled to Snezhnaya to await news on who their new commanding Harbinger would be. Meanwhile, some other branches in the Fatui saw Signora's vacancy as an opportunity to promote other Harbingers' agendas, such as with [[Efim Snezhevich]]'s plan to build [[Crucabena|Arlecchino's]] prestige by sabotaging the peace talks between the Shogunate and the Watatsumi forces. In [[Snezhnaya]], the remaining Harbingers arranged her burial and remarked about her demise, with [[Pulcinella]] decreeing that the Fatui halt their work for half a day to mourn her passing.

==Trivia==
* English texts consistently use the title "Crimson Witch of Flame(s)" for her name and artifact set.
** On the other hand, the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean versions use the grand title {{Lang|"Witch of Blazing Flame"|zh=炽烈的炎之魔女|ja=燃え盛る炎の魔女|ko=불타오르는 화염의 마녀|sort=zh,ja,ko}} only for her artifact set; for her name, they use a shorter title {{Lang|"Witch of Flame"|zh=炎之魔女|ja=炎の魔女|ko=염화의 마녀|sort=zh,ja,ko}}.
* While there has been no unequivocal confirmation that Signora is the same person as the Crimson Witch of Flame, there are enough similarities between the two that it is unlikely they are different people.
** [[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku#Boss Description|Signora's boss description in the Archive]] indicates that her embers were once intense flames in both English and Chinese: {{Lang|"her Delusion is meant to shackle a flame that will devour everything ... And it was the embers of that flame, which had accumulated over many long years"|zh=邪眼是抑制啃噬一切的烈火的器物…而这就是漫长的岁月中积郁的余烬|zh_tl=the Delusion is an artifact that suppresses the blazing fire that consumes everything ... And these are the embers accumulated over the long years}}.
*** Notably, {{Lang|zh=烈火|zh_tl=blazing fire}} is used and is similar to the grand title of the Crimson Witch of Flames in Chinese, {{Lang|zh=炽烈的炎之魔女|zh_tl=Witch of Blazing Flame}}.
**The English titles "Crimson Witch of Flame(s)" and "Crimson Witch of Embers" are structured too similarly to not be intentional.
** The descriptions of [[Molten Moment]] and [[Hellfire Butterfly]] say that Signora burned evil and that someone close to her died during a time with "poisoned blood." The Crimson Witch of Flame burned monsters and demons, and Rostam died in Khaenri'ah during the cataclysm.
** The Harbinger recruited in [[Pale Flame#Stainless Bloom|Stainless Bloom]] was filled with fierce, undying flames that nearly consumed her and were only extinguished with Cryo from the Tsaritsa after meeting Pierro. The Crimson Witch of Flame turned her body into liquid fire, and [[Ashen Heart]] and [[Funerary Mask]] say that Signora nearly died from her own fire and that she received a Cryo Delusion from Pierro. This is unlikely to be a coincidence. Fires and flames are not typically described as pale, but Signora's dialogue during [[Duel Before the Throne]] includes two instances of {{Lang|"pale flame"|zh=苍白之火|zh_rm=Cāngbái zhī Huǒ|zh_tl=pale fire}}, and Stainless Bloom is part of the {{Lang|[[Pale Flame]]|zh=苍白之火|zh_rm=Cāngbái zhī Huǒ|zh_tl=Pale Fire}} artifact set.
** Molten Moment is nearly identical in shape to the Crimson Witch of Flames flower artifact, [[Crimson Witch of Flames#Witch's Flower of Blaze|Witch's Flower of Blaze]]. This is notable because unlike other items, all artifact items thus far have been completely unique in shape even when compared to non-artifact items, except for the Prayers circlets (recolors of each other since they're related) and the [[Initiate]] and [[Brave Heart]] flowers and plumes (same shape, probably because the Initiate set is relatively inconsequential).
* Signora shares the same Chinese voice actress with [[Eula]].
* Signora shares the same Japanese voice actress with [[Changsheng]] and [[Bonanus]].

===Etymology===
* "{{w|La Signora}}" (The Lady) is a stock character in {{it|{{w|commedia dell'arte}}}}, a type of Italian theater. In such plays, La Signora is typically tough, beautiful, and calculating; she is also proud and enjoys mocking others. Oftentimes, she is the wife of Pantalone and the mistress of Pedrolino.
* Rosalyne is of Latin or Germanic origin and can mean "beautiful, pretty rose" or "gentle horse" respectively.
* The etymology of Kruzchka is unclear.
** It may come from German {{de|Kreuz|tl=cross}} and the Russian diminutive suffix {{ru|-чка}}, meaning "Little Cross."
** In the Russian localization of the game, Kruzchka is written as {{ru|Кручка}}. This name may or may not be related to the following words:
*** {{ru|Круча}}, which means "cliff," "precipice," or "steep descent."
*** {{ru|Круша}}, which is a conjugation of {{ru|Крушить}}, which means "to destroy" or "to shatter."
*** {{ru|Кружка}}, which means "mug," "tankard," "noggin" or "poor box," "charity box."
**** This word is also a declension of {{ru|Кружoк}}, which means "circle," "study group," or "interest group."
* Lohefalter means "blazing butterfly" in German.
