==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hana:''' I can barely keep my eyes open... When will [[Ziryab|he]] stop?
:{{DIcon}} What's going on?
::'''Hana:''' Oh, because of somebody, I don't get enough sleep.
::'''Hana:''' He's forcing me to spend too much time with him every night. It would be fine if we just go to the bar, but he just makes me listen to gibberish by the side of the road.
::'''Hana:''' If I liked hearing other people read, I'd go to a lecture!
::'''Hana:''' Could it be that he's insinuating I should read more!?
::'''Hana:''' I didn't know that it's this tedious to date a bookworm!
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Hana:''' If only I could sleep standing up like [[Hakan]]...
