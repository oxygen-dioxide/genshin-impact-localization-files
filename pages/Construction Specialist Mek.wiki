==Descriptions==
{{Description|A type of large clockwork meka which also has immeasurable value when utilized in building construction and archeological excavation. Its name comes from an engineer employed by [[Callas]] during the construction of the [[Clementine Line]].<br>With Callas' financial backing, this engineer built the legendary "Golden Vessel" – a gigantic piece of construction machinery which was used to dig the [[Poisson Tunnel]]. Once the job was complete, this type of clockwork meka was designed with a similar structure but reduced to a smaller scale.|[[Archive]]}}
