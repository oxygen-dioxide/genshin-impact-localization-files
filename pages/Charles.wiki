==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Charles:''' What'll it be today?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy something to drink.
::'''Charles:''' Here's the menu. Let me know once you're ready to order.
:;(Opens Angel's Share menu)
:{{DIcon}} About [[Stormterror]]...
:;(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Charles:''' It's been quite the headache for sure. Stormterror's affected our tavern's supply routes, so the variety of wines here has also dropped...
::'''Charles:''' As for Stormterror itself, I'm not too worried. I think those people who numb themselves with alcohol are just scared out of their wits.
::'''Charles:''' But we do reach the point of no return, then we just need to wait for night to fall.
::'''Charles:''' The "[[Darknight Hero|Knight Who Emerges At Night]]" will not just stand idly by..

:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Charles:''' Well, what's passed has passed, I say.
::'''Charles:''' Life isn't all sweet fruit juice. It also needs some bitter alcohol. These incidents will also become part of our experience.
::'''Charles:''' Rather than ask how this could happen, we should look forward to the future. Accepting the bitter with the sweet is how adults do things.
::'''Charles:''' Once you're ready for the bitter, I'll pour you a special brew.
:{{DIcon}} Any recommendations?
::'''Charles:''' The apple cider from the Dawn Winery is a special at Angel's Share.
::'''Charles:''' You can try my special cocktail if you want. The cocktail is on the house if it's your first time here.
::{{DIcon}} What sort of liquor is the best?<!--might be available once unlocking something?-->
:::'''Charles:''' If you like strong wine, then I'd recommend that you try Death After Noon. It's Captain [[Kaeya]]'s favorite.
:::'''Charles:''' But the strongest wine I know has to be the one called Fire-Water.
:::'''Charles:''' It hails from [[Snezhnaya]], and was brought into Mondstadt by Snezhnayan merchants, but Master Diluc stopped importing it, saying that it didn't fit the tastes of the people here.
:::'''Charles:''' The only remaining bottle is from the original batch. It's for display purposes only, though, so you'll have to go to Snezhnaya if you want to try some.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself.
::'''Charles:''' You want to know about me?
::'''Charles:''' I've been working as a bartender here for more than a decade. I'm employed by the Dawn Winery, like everyone else.
::'''Charles:''' I'm not that interested in alcohol, but it's my job so...
::'''Charles:''' I mean, I'm not like [[Diona]] at [[Cat's Tail]]. I heard she hates alcohol.
::'''Charles:''' Occasionally, Master Diluc, the owner of the winery, will cover my shift.
::'''Charles:''' Days off are precious after all, so I'm very thankful to him for that.
:{{DIcon}} Not right now, thanks.
::'''Charles:''' Really? Shouldn't drink too much anyway I guess.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Of Drink A-Dreaming===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Charles:''' Do you need a hand with anything?
:{{DIcon|Gear}} I'd like to take part in the bartender challenge.
::'''Charles:''' Looks like you're ready. In that case, let us begin.
:;(Opens Bartender Challenge screen)
:{{DIcon|Gear}} I'd like to come up with a new mix.
::'''Charles:''' Sure. We've already restocked on ingredients, so please, feel free — let your imagination run wild!
:;(Opens drink mixing screen)
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Charles:''' No problem. If you ever need any help, just come and look for me.
