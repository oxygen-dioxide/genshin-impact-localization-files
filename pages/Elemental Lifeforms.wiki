'''Elemental Lifeforms''' are enemies made purely of one element which they are immune to. Some Elemental Lifeforms apply their own element to themselves, allowing [[Elemental Reactions]] with that element to occur. Elemental Lifeforms include [[Slimes]] and [[Hypostases]].

[[Mystical Beasts]] are similar to Elemental Lifeforms, but are not made out of pure elemental energy making them distinctly different.
