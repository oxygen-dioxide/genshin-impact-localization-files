{{Description|This place was once a paradise from someone's dreams. Search through its former bountiful blossoms and restore peace to the land once more.}}
'''Domain of the Wayward Path''' is a [[One-Time Domain]] located between [[Lingju Pass]] and [[Mt. Tianheng]] in [[Liyue]]. There is only one level, '''Tarry Among the Peach Blossoms'''.

==Guide==
===First Area===
You need a Geo character to clear this area. After entering the domain, you will be faced with 5 pillars in a circular formation that can be activated only by Geo elemental damage. Activating all 5 pillars will allow you to advance to the second and final area.

Every pillar activated by {{Color|Geo DMG}} will '''activate it''' and '''change the activation state''' of the '''two adjacent''' pillars. (e.g. Assuming the 1st, 2nd and 3rd pillar are deactivated, activating the 2nd pillar will also activate the 1st and 3rd pillar.

However, if the 1st pillar is activated while the 2nd and 3rd are deactivated, activating the 2nd will deactivate the 1st and activate the 3rd.)

From the stairs facing the tree, activate the pillars in the following order:
#Upper Left
#Lower Left
#Lower Right
#Upper Left
In that order, you would activate all five pillars to advance to the next area.

===Second Area===
A time trial stage in which you need to defeat a certain number of enemies within the 5 minute time limit.

After defeating the enemies one [[Precious Chest]] will spawn.
