==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Orqo:''' ...Let's go somewhere a bit further away!
:{{DIcon}} So? How's your hidden power?
::'''Orqo:''' Mmm... It's still hidden. Sometimes I can't help but think it's just keeping really, really calm. Still, it doesn't matter. I've got a long list of places I haven't been to yet!
::'''Orqo:''' So there should be plenty more opportunities to awaken it, right? I've also heard some other incantations and versions recently, so I can give 'em all a try.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Don't worry your family too much.
::'''Orqo:''' I know, I know! Next time I'll explain things to Dad before I leave... Hmm, here, take this! I've heard that it'll bring good luck on your next trip. C'mon, take it!

:{{DIcon}} About the story of Qoyllor...
::'''Orqo:''' Well, I now know that was a story passed down by the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]. And it wasn't because he was punished by the sun that [[Waranka|Dad]] can't see...
::'''Orqo:''' Though, if Mom didn't go back to the stars, where did she go?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Orqo:''' See you!
