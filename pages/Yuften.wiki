==Profile==
Yuften is a member of the Tanit tribe who is tasked with raising the [[Spinocrocodile]]s that dwell on the spring that the tribe resides around. 

During the Tanit World Quest event series, after [[Jeht]] discovers the depth of [[Babel]]'s machinations on her, she decides to enact revenge by destroying the entire tribe. Yuften is one of the tribesmen called by Babel to kill her, but he ends up dying to Jeht instead.

===Appearance===
Yuften wears the standard [[Eremite Sword-Dancer]] attire, though he does not have an eyepatch, which is instead replaced with a farmer's hat.

===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before meeting Yuften in ''Wisdom Has Built Her House, She Has Hewn Out Her Seven Pillars''.''

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yuften:''' He&mdash;Hello, stranger. D&mdash;Do you need something?
:{{DIcon}} These crocodiles...
::'''Yuften:''' T&mdash;These crocodiles a&mdash;are raised by the tribe. T&mdash;They're bulky, b&mdash;but also gentle.
::'''Yuften:''' Crocodiles are easy to care for, and they can be harvested for their skin and meat. Th&mdash;Thankfully, we have an undrying spring here, so...
:{{DIcon}} I shan't disturb you any longer.
::'''Yuften:''' Yeah. S&mdash;Safe travels, stranger.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Step 11 of ''Wisdom Has Built Her House, She Has Hewn Out Her Seven Pillars''.''

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yuften:''' Hello... Guest of Tanit...
:'''Yuften:''' J&mdash;J&mdash;[[Jeht]] mentions you often. She's a good kid.
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
::'''Yuften:''' Planting crops and f&mdash;feeding the fish. Sometimes, I also do some b&mdash;b&mdash;butchery. Crocodile skin and meat is v&mdash;very useful.
:{{DIcon}} Crocodiles, you say?!
::'''Yuften:''' Hehe, yes. I&mdash;I take care of them. These are quite large and obedient...
::'''Yuften:''' This one's c&mdash;c&mdash;called Sedim. Very fierce and strong, and skin's very vibrant. It'll make for a good satchel. And there's that one, Karam. It's small but plump. Rather gentle, too.
:'''Yuften:''' We get clean spring water all year around h&mdash;here, so it's just right for raising crocodiles. Th&mdash;that's why we fenced this place up.
:'''Yuften:''' Crocodiles are easy to care for, and they can be harvested for lots of skins and meat. Unfortunately, f&mdash;fields are a d&mdash;different story...
:{{DIcon}} You have fields around here?
:'''Yuften:''' We do... but only for testing. [[Babel|Matriarch Babel]] invited some outsiders to c&mdash;c&mdash;come and provide us with [[Anahitian Blessing]], and she got all these old books from the city...
:'''Yuften:''' S&mdash;s&mdash;so we've tried our hand at farming according to the contents of these books.
:'''Yuften:''' But the oases in the canyon are too narrow and lack nutrients. We needs to find a way to f&mdash;fertilize the soil.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Anahitian Blessing...
:'''Yuften:''' The outsiders didn't want to reveal the fertilizer's composition. As such, we've had to rely on the people who provide it to f&mdash;fertilize the soil... which isn't good.
:'''Yuften:''' Th&mdash;that's why the Matriarch wants me to d&mdash;do some research here to r&mdash;reverse engineer our own Anahitian Blessing.
:{{DIcon}} I shan't disturb you any longer.
:'''Yuften:''' Th&mdash;that's alright. Please take some [[Crocodile Jerky|crocodile jerky]], dear guest. It's just over there...

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after completing ''[[Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part I]]''.''

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yuften:''' H&mdash;H&mdash;Hello. Ah...
:{{DIcon}} Is something upsetting you?
:'''Yuften:''' Ah... [[Aderfi]]... H&mdash;He... Sorry. He used to be my f&mdash;friend.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry about your friend...
:'''Yuften:''' I hope that th&mdash;the Matriarch c&mdash;can be merciful...
:'''Yuften:''' Otherwise, the c&mdash;crocodiles m&mdash;might suffer some i&mdash;indigestion...
:{{DIcon}} ...

===Dialogue Set #4===
''Available after completing ''[[The Eternal Dream, Ever Lush]]''.''

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yuften:''' Greetings, esteemed g&mdash;guest.
;(If Behold, the Sign Comes Like A Thief... has not been completed)
::'''Yuften:''' *sigh* I h&mdash;heard about what happened with Azariq and Aderfi. I d&mdash;didn't think th&mdash;that Azariq would turn t&mdash;traitor too.
::'''Yuften:''' W&mdash;we'd known each other f&mdash;for such a long t&mdash;time, too. What a shame...
::{{DIcon}} I'm sorry...
::'''Yuften:''' I&mdash;it's okay. I&mdash;I just th&mdash;think it's a bit of a shame that they weren't brought b&mdash;back here to be executed.
::'''Yuften:''' But I s&mdash;suppose I'll be able to find m&mdash;meat elsewhere.
::'''Yuften:''' I&mdash;is there anything else y&mdash;you need?
;(If Behold, the Sign Comes Like A Thief... has been completed)
::'''Yuften:''' I&mdash;is there something you n&mdash;need today? I h&mdash;heard you went to Gurabad... I&mdash;it is a shame that the J&mdash;Jinni can no longer speak.
::'''Yuften:''' But seeing you r&mdash;return unharmed is a blessing...
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
::'''Yuften:''' Planting crops and f&mdash;feeding the fish. Sometimes, I also do some b&mdash;b&mdash;butchery. Crocodile skin and meat is v&mdash;very useful.
:{{DIcon}} Crocodiles, you say!?
::'''Yuften:''' Hehe, yes. I&mdash;I take care of them. These are quite large and obedient...
::'''Yuften:''' This one's c&mdash;c&mdash;called Sedim. Very fierce and strong, and skin's very vibrant. It'll make for a good satchel. And there's that one, Karam. It's small but plump. Rather gentle, too.
