'''Atawallpa''' is a historical character from [[Natlan]]'s [[Meztli]] tribe. He was the elder twin hero between himself and [[Waskar]].

==Profile==
Atawallpa was one of the heroes who rose up against the insane king, alongside the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth]], [[Sakkuk]], Waskar, [[Yupanqui]], and the [[Masterful Craftsman]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Moment of Attainment}}</ref> Sakkuk remembers Atawallpa as an "incorrigible chatterbox," and he and Waskar liked joking around.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|The Wine-Flask Over Which the Plan Was Hatched}}</ref> The twins appear to have been close; they joined the youth at the same time,<ref name="Dark Fruit">{{Ref/Arti|Dark Fruit of Bright Flowers}}</ref> and when Waskar was slain in battle, Atawallpa's screams of despair left his throat hoarse.<ref name="Crownless">{{Ref/Arti|Crownless Crown}}</ref>

Atawallpa died sometime before Sakkuk did.<ref name="Crownless" />

===Appearance===
The only description of Atawallpa's appearance relates to his mouth, stating that his "lips and teeth were sharper than any blade."<ref name="Dark Fruit" />

==Trivia==
* Hero twins are a {{w|Hero Twins in Native American culture|prominent motif in Native American cultures}}.
===Etymology===
* Atawallpa and Waskar's names are derived from the Quechua names of {{w|Atahualpa}} and {{w|Waskar Inka}}, half-brothers who each laid claim to the throne of the Inca Empire after their father's death. The ensuing succession crisis led to the {{w|Inca Civil War}}.
