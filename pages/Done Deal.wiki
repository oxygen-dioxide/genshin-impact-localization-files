{{Description|"Here are the full terms for this matter of life and death &mdash; by which I mean my life and your death!"}}
'''Done Deal''' is [[Yanfei]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* At maximum Scarlet Seals, Yanfei has to consume the existing Scarlet Seals before another can be granted by '''Brilliance'''.
* The Brilliance's effect lags behind the Elemental Burst by '''0.3s'''. Theoretically, Yanfei can gain the first Scarlet Seal after 1.3s of using Elemental Burst. However, Yanfei has to consume the existing Scarlet Seals first. The time required to do so exceeded 1.3s. Hence the first Scarlet Seal is granted at exactly '''2.3s''' after using Elemental Burst and a Charged Attack.
* '''Brilliance''' ticks at exactly '''1.0s''' interval, granting one Scarlet Seal at every tick. The timing of the ticks cannot be influenced by any factors. If none of the ticks are wasted due to excess, Yanfei can gain a maximum of '''14''' Scarlet Seals through Brilliance.
