The '''Harmosts''' were the four governors of the kingdom of [[Remuria]], appointed by the God King [[Remus]]. Their authority was second to only Remus himself,<ref name="History">{{Ref/Book|The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria|2}}</ref> and they were revered almost as much.

Since music was a fundamental source of power in Remuria, the Harmosts were skilled as both musicians and warriors. They served as military commanders, diplomatic representatives, and educators.<ref name="Finale">{{Ref/Weapon|Finale of the Deep}}</ref>
