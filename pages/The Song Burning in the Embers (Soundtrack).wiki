|- 
| May the birds soar from their cage
| &mdash;
|-
| Sunbeams filter through the foliage
| &mdash;
|-
| Flames grow with immortal courage
| &mdash;
|-
| And I hope you won't be tainted by fate
| &mdash;
|-
| Nothing to fear
| &mdash;
|-
| So go alone
| &mdash;
|-
| Stay awake don't fall asleep
| &mdash;
|-
| The way is long and the gloom is deep
| &mdash;
|-
| Embers glowing in the hearth still seen
| &mdash;
|-
| And I hope you won't be tainted by fate
| &mdash;
|-
| Nothing to fear
| &mdash;
|-
| Never look back
| &mdash;
|-
| (Nec fatum finire te)
| (Neither fate nor tribulation)
|-
| (Nec tribulatio potest)
| (Can define you)
|-
| (Haec olim meminisse iuvabit)
| (One day it will be pleasant to remember this)
|-
| And your world will never fall away
| &mdash;
|-
| Nothing to fear
| &mdash;
|-
| Beneath the scars
| &mdash;
|-
| You'll never be tainted by fate
| &mdash;
