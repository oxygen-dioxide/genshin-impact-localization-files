'''Climbing''' is a movement ability that allows the player to climb any surface that is climbable and would not require the character to hang upside-down or nearly upside-down. Some surfaces, such as the walls inside domains, are not climbable regardless of the angle they are at.

Climbing costs [[Stamina]]. If the player runs out of Stamina while climbing, they will fall and sustain [[Fall Damage]] based on the distance between the point they fell from and the area where they land.

Like [[Swimming]] and [[Gliding]], the player cannot perform combat abilities while climbing.

==Climb Jump==
Players can perform a climb jump, which costs more Stamina but allows players to scale mountains quicker. Climb jumps can be performed while at rest or while the player is moving. If the player is moving when a climb jump is performed, then the jump will be in the direction of movement unless the movement is diagonally downward or purely downward, which will result in a pure horizontal jump or jumping off of the surface entirely, respectively.
