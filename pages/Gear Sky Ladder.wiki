'''Gear Sky Ladder''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Constellation Metropole]], [[Simulanka]]. This is a lift mechanism that the player can stand on with a key device in the middle. The player can repeatedly attack this key device to raise the lift mechanism:
* Each attack on the device will raise the lift by one floor.
* If the player has not attacked the device after approximately six seconds, the lift will fall back down to the first floor.
* If the lift is falling back down, the player can attack the device to abort.
