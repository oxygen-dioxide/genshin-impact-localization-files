==Weak Point Location==

Ruin Scout Weak Point.png

* The Weak Point is only exposed during the '''Headbutt''' attack.

==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Headbutt
|desc_1 = Turning its body on the side, it charges up a lunge to headbutt its target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}. Its core is exposed while charging but is protected while it lunges.

|name_2 = Tentacle Spin
|desc_2 = The Scout spins its 4 tentacles dealing '''30.7% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|AoE Physical DMG}}. Core is protected.

|name_3 = Orb Lay
|desc_3 = The Scout quickly charges an energized orb and sets it right below itself. The orb deals '''38.4% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to players that come in contact. When two or more orbs are on the field, the orbs will make an energized beam that connects them, dealing '''38.4% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to players that come in contact. If one of the orbs disappears, the beam connecting to it will disappear. During this whole attack, its core is protected.

|name_4 = Discharge
|desc_4 = Planting itself, the Scout charges up before discharging energy around itself, dealing '''76.9% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}. Its core is protected during this attack.

|name_5 = Deactivated
|desc_5 = After having its core hit twice while exposed, it will fall to the ground and deactivate. During this short time the Scout will not attack.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet both of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
* If multiple abilities meet both conditions, one will be chosen at random.
* Global CD is shared with all nearby [[Ruin Sentinels]].

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Various bizarrely-shaped machines that have taken different forms and functions to adapt to different goals.<br />Legend has it that they are war machines left behind by a nation that has already been destroyed. Compared to the more common [[Ruin Guard]]s, their design has greater value in the study of biomimesis. Exactly why the form and movements of certain deep-sea lifeforms are being imitated is not known. But either way, tangling with them is hardly the best idea.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
