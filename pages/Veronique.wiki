'''Veronique''' is an event-exclusive [[NPC]] who appeared in the Event [[Roses and Muskets]].

==Profile==
Veronique is one of the children of the nobleman [[Morris]] and his maid [[Elisa]], along with her brother [[Baptiste]]. Morris, who feared the lashback should the relationship be known, sent Elisa away. Elisa, still believing he loved her, carried on with the pregnancy and gave birth to her and Baptiste, sending a photo of them to Morris. At that time, Morris had entered a relationship with another woman, and fearful of what would happen, hired an assassin from the [[Court of Fontaine: Fleuve Cendre|Fleuve Cendre]] to kill them. Elisa hid the two under the floor of their home and confronted the assassin, dying in the process.

Veronique and Baptiste, fearing for their lives, did not emerge until several days had passed. They were aware of their mother's murderer and sought revenge, but due to Morris' connections, were unable to reach him. By the events of the [[Fontinalia Festival]], Veronique applied to [[Xavier]]'s crew, who were going to create a film adaptation of Baptiste's book, "The Two Musketeers". She was given the role of prop manager, which she would use to buy parts for an actual working musket. She practiced and refined her skills in the Fleuve Cendre, before she killed the assassin that had killed their mother, leaving behind a [[Rainbow Rose]] from Baptiste's home on his body.

The [[Maison Gardiennage]] began to investigate the murder, with [[Chevreuse]] deducing that the siblings were responsible due to her friend [[Emilie]] recognizing the particular strain only growing in one location. Baptiste covers for her, claiming to be the killer, but this only gives Chevreuse more doubt when he is unable to reassemble the murder weapon. He would inform her that he had placed trust in that she would kill Morris for them. Once Chevreuse managed to corner Morris and make him confess to the murder, she did not do so, prompting Veronique to appear and shoot him, only for her shot to be blocked by Chevreuse's musket. Veronique was in anguish over the fact that she did not kill him, but Chevreuse claims that justice had to be enacted properly. As she is taken away alongside Morris to the [[Fortress of Meropide]], she tells her that she was not convinced with her judgement and that justice was not served that day.

Chevreuse, understanding the siblings' anguish, decides to give [[Wriothesley]] a "heads-up" on their arrival. When he does not confirm nor deny her "heads-up", she suggests that he give everyone in the prison a copy of [[The Steambird]] once the murder case is published, which would make her and her brother seen as heroes and Morris as the villain, to ensure that Morris would not live a comfortable life in prison as the two had feared.
