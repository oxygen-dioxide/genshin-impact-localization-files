{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kinich at the Stadium entrance, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq002 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are your plans, Kinich?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq002 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I've gotta deliver some ceremonial artifacts back to my tribe. I didn't place too well in this Pilgrimage, so, now that it's over, it's time to get home and get back to work.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq002 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You didn't get enough points?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq002 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Yeah. I got injured during the team round and wound up losing two key matches during individual competition &mdash; both against opponents I'd faced many times in the past. We've each had our fair share of wins and losses. It happens.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq002 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Haha, that's what you get for locking me away earlier! Get used to the taste of karma... May those injuries be the first of many!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq002 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq002 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' ...Hey! What are you doing!? Argh...!

;(Approach the entrance to "People of the Springs")
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're finally here! So, this is your home, Mualani! Paimon can't wait to have a look around!
:;(A man sits in the springs with a [[Capybara]] and a [[Crimson Finch]])
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 moeava 01.ogg}} '''Moeava:''' Ahh... See, what did I tell you? A dip in the hot springs after a battle is just the best!
:;(A couple soak in a nearby spring)
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 taheta 01.ogg}} '''Taheta:''' Fetch me a bottle of wine, would you, dear?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 makemo 01.ogg}} '''Makemo:''' Just one? Let's get another, it's still early in the day, isn't it?
:;(Nearby, on the beach)
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 taenga 01.ogg}} '''Taenga:''' Wanna go to Golden Dusk later?
:;(Nearby, overlooking the springs)
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mersa 01.ogg}} '''Mersa:''' Now this is a vacation... Absolutely amazing!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, it's so lively around here! Is there some kind of holiday going on?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We try to treat every day like a holiday around here. We believe every day is worth celebrating.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Now, let me show you around. Hmm... where to start...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Xochicuicatl Records, Colomche Plaza... There are so many options, but I recommend starting with the real highlight around here.
:{{DIcon}} The real highlight?
:{{DIcon}} What's that?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The hot springs, of course! Natural hot springs have tons of health benefits. Go for a nice, long soak, and you're guaranteed a good night's sleep!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Wait, you want us to bathe... here?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, don't be shy. C'mon, I'll take you to get changed&mdash;
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Mualani!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Huh? Oh... Auntie [[Atea]]!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 02.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Please, I've told you just "Atea" is fine. Do I look that old to you?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 03a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 03b.ogg}}--> '''Atea:''' Were you taking these two to the hot springs?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 07b.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's right. Oh, let me introduce you. This is {{Traveler}}, and the small one next to {{MC|m=him|f=her}} is Paimon.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 08a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 08b.ogg}}--> '''Mualani:''' They only just arrived in [[Natlan]], so I'm taking them around to experience our customs!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi, there!
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 04.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Ah, I'm Mualani's neighbor, Atea. By the way, Mualani, I heard you lost to Kachina during the Pilgrimage. Is that true?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, I was THIS close to winning. *sigh*... Definitely not the result I wanted, but, still, not too surprising. Kachina's always been strong.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Anyway, it's all in the past. I'm gonna take these two for a dip in the hot springs. Talk to you later!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, wait, you'll need swimsuits first... Hmm, I'm sure I can find something lying around the shop. I'll go look!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 05.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Hold it right there, young lady. Have you forgotten the rule about bathing in the hot springs?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Rule...? Oh, wait, you mean&mdash;
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a rule about bathing in the hot springs?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 06.ogg}} '''Atea:''' That's right. Outlanders have to complete a "trial" at an artificial hot spring before they're allowed access to the natural ones.
:{{DIcon}} A trial?
:{{DIcon}} Do we have to fight something?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It's not nearly as scary as it sounds. Basically, natural hot springs have higher temperatures that not everyone can withstand.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' A few travelers have gotten scalded by the water in the past, so now we have an unwritten rule: All outlanders need to adapt to the lower-temperature, artificial springs first.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 15a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 15b.ogg}}--> '''Mualani:''' But, seriously, Auntie Atea, do we have to be so strict? These two are formidable adventurers. I know they can handle it!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 07.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Famous last words... The hot springs are not to be underestimated. You can never be too careful. Besides, the environment's been unstable lately. It could be a sign that the Abyss is about to attack.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that sounds dangerous! Y'know, Paimon's really not all that "formidable," so... careful is good!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 08.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Exactly, there will be no excessive risk-taking on my watch. Mualani, take them to the artificial spring first.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 16.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Okay, okay.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 09.ogg}} '''Atea:''' That's more like it, and don't try anything funny. I'm heading to the artificial spring in a bit, and if I don't see you there... Your days of copping free meals at my place are done.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 17.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Relax, relax... Oh, by the way, Atea, how have you been feeling lately?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 10.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Much better &mdash; how else would I have the energy to keep an eye on all you rascals?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 11.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Hey, you over there! How many times have I told you, no roughhousing near the hot springs!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 niu 01.ogg}} '''Niu:''' Oh, shoot, that weird lady's back again!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 anaa 01.ogg}} '''Anaa:''' Run!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 atea 12.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Stop right there! You need a stern talking to!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She sure has a lot of energy...
:{{DIcon}} Is she an old friend of yours?
:{{DIcon}} You seem really close.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 18.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Haha, she's a legend in our tribe. Everyone knows her.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 19.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Back before I inherited my [[Ancient Name]], she was one of Natlan's most renowned warriors, famous for her love of hot springs. In fact, she often threw parties at the hot springs.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 20.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' She referred to anyone who came to these parties as her "hot spring buddies." The attendees were all respected warriors like [[Liliuo]], [[Kaiulani]], [[Vichama]]... Oh, and [[Mavuika|the Archon]].
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If Paimon lived here, she would take advantage of the hot springs, too!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 21.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It's just... During battle, she was impaled in the abdomen by an Abyssal monster.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 22.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The doctors managed to save her life, but they made it clear that she could never bathe in the hot springs again.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 23.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Abyssal power still exists within her body. Immersing herself in hot water would accelerate the corrosion of her internal organs and the progression of her illness.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, no wonder she had so many scars... Paimon had no idea she was so seriously injured...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 24.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's normal. She never talks about her injury.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 25.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' She's worked tirelessly over the years to dig up artificial springs so that more and more people can experience our tribe's natural wonders, even though she can't enjoy them herself. I really respect her for that.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 1 mualani 26.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Anyway, let's head to the artificial springs. If Auntie Atea gets there before us, we're gonna be in some real hot water.

;(Approach [[Amina]], [[Hikueru]], and Marokau)
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 amina 01.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Oh... I see. That's a great idea. I like it!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 hikueru 01.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' See, I told you the Chief would agree!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 marokau 01.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' Let's get moving, then! We can't let a word of this slip to anyone else...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hey, Amina, Hikueru, Marokau! You three seem particularly cheerful today. What's the occasion?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 hikueru 02.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' Oh, Mualani, you're back! Umm, who are these two...?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 mualani 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq003 2 mualani 02b.ogg}}--> '''Mualani:''' This is {{Traveler}} and Paimon, two very important guests. I wanted to take them to the natural hot springs, but Auntie Atea caught us, so we had to come here first.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 amina 02.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Oh, what a coincidence! We were just talking about her.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 marokau 02.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' We think Auntie Atea's illness has taken a turn for the better.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Really? How can you tell?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 hikueru 03.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' Okay, so, while you've been busy with the Pilgrimage, we noticed that she's been visiting the hot springs alone at night.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 hikueru 04.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' Specifically, the hot springs in the cave to the north of our settlement &mdash; I'm sure you know the one. Apparently, she used to go there a lot before they became abandoned for some reason.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 hikueru 05.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' She could never come into contact with hot water before, and now she's visiting the hot springs every night. I mean, it's pretty obvious what that means, right?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 marokau 03.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' Yeah, so we got to thinking... What if we renovated the abandoned spring behind her back, then threw her a huge surprise party!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 marokau 04.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' Chief Amina thinks it's a great idea, too. So, you want in?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Of course! How could you even think of pulling this off without me?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I'm a little busy right now, though. I'll come find you once we're done at the hot springs.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 amina 03.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Of course, take your time! You should focus on our guests, for now.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 amina 04.ogg}} '''Amina:''' These artificial springs are pretty new, but the experience is just as good as the natural ones, if you ask me. We really worked hard on them, so I hope you enjoy!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 amina 05.ogg}} '''Amina:''' And you two... I know you want to focus on Atea's surprise, but don't forget your patrol duties in the meantime. The Abyss could attack at any moment, so we need to stay vigilant.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 hikueru 06.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' You got it, Chief. We'll keep an eye out &mdash; you can count on us.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 marokau 05.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' Alright, we're off, then. See you at the abandoned spring, Mualani.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 amina 06.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I'm also gonna head out. Have fun!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 2 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Finally, it's hot spring time! Oh, I already arranged swimwear for you guys, by the way. C'mon, I'll show you to the changing room.

;(Enter the changing rooms)

:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The first time I came to the hot springs, there was no calming effect whatsoever. I was such a little ball of energy, the moment my parents looked away, I ran off to the high-temperature pools.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It's actually pretty funny looking back on it. They were absolutely frantic, looking for me all over, until, finally, they saw my head slowly poke out from under the water.

:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mmm, these are great!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 atea 04.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Well, I did make them myself.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 atea 05.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Very few young people know how to truly appreciate hot springs, so listen carefully. The temperature of the hot spring not only determines the types of snacks you should choose, but also the amount of time you should spend in the water.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 atea 06.ogg}} '''Atea:''' To bathe in a hot spring is to completely empty your mind. As such, swimming around the pool is incredibly disruptive and impolite... and something you should absolutely not learn from Mualani.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hey!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 atea 07.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Alright. Looks like you were able to adapt to the temperature no problem. You should be able to switch to the natural springs, then.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 atea 08.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Well, I've got to get going. Oh, and make sure you drink your milk. I'm looking at you, Mualani. I still remember how you used to pour it into the water when you were little.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 atea 09.ogg}} '''Atea:''' That better not happen again, whether I'm here to catch you or not.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Okay, okay.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't think you were the type to do something like that...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Haha, I remember thinking I'd totally get away with it, too! But, turns out milk is pretty easy to spot when you pour it into clear water... Not my best work.
:{{Black Screen|You drink the milk and enjoy the hot spring with Mualani...}}
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Some people get dizzy if they stay in here too long. You guys alright?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's fine, just a bit stuffed...
:{{DIcon}} I feel fine, too.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Looks like you two are naturals! Oh, by the way, I have to leave you on your own for a little while this afternoon. I'm gonna help the others fix up that abandoned spring.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I certainly don't trust their aesthetic tastes. Who knows what will become of the place if I leave them unattended?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' In exchange, though, I can recommend a couple of shops that are worth a visit...
:{{DIcon}} We'll help too.
:{{DIcon}} As long as we're not in the way...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hmm?
:{{DIcon}} Atea has been really kind to us...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! She brought us snacks and taught us about the hot springs... We wanna do our part too.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Friends are supposed to help each other out! We'd feel bad, otherwise.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, then... The more the merrier!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 3 mualani 16.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, we should get going. Let's organize the best hot spring gathering Natlan's {{sic|every}} seen!

:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're here to help!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 marokau 01.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' But, you're important guests! We can't put you to work!
:{{DIcon}} We want to do our part.
:{{DIcon}} We don't have anything else to do at the moment.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, alright. Stop trying to out-polite each other, would you? The sooner we get this party started the sooner we get to enjoy the real party!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Now, where to start... Hmm, looks like the water outlet is blocked pretty bad. We'll need to dig under it.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Those boxes in the corner need to be thrown out as well... Gah. They're moldy as all get out!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Also, someone needs to go out and get some cloth, wood, and decorations... Oh, and snacks, too! I say we get enough for twenty or thirty people. Bulk purchases fetch the best prices, after all... Oh, but don't just accept the first offer they give you&mdash;
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 hikueru 02.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' Um... I'm not good at haggling. Why don't you go?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 marokau 02.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' Hey, I'm not any better, and I wouldn't even know what to buy. Umm, how about we handle things here while you three deal with the shopping?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, that works, too!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 4 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I can introduce you to all the shops while we're at it. Alright, let's meet back here later.

:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 01.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' Well, if it isn't Mualani. Back from The Pilgrimage?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's right. Didn't make the cut this year, though.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 02.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' Well, it wouldn't be a competition if everyone got to win. So, what'll it be today?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Here, it's all on the list &mdash; quite a sizeable order, as you can see. So, uh... can we expect a discount?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 03.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' Wow, that is large order. What's it all for, a party?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's right. Keep this between us for now... but, we're throwing a hot spring party for Auntie Atea.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 04.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' Wait, you're saying she can go in the hot springs again? That's great news! How about this &mdash; you can have the decorations on the house, and I'll give you twenty percent off the cloth and wood.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' C'mon, I know you can sweeten the deal. That pile of wood's been sitting there since I left for The Pilgrimage. At this rate, you need to get rid of it or it's gonna go moldy...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 05.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' Alright, alright... *sigh* Such a handful. Just give me a moment while I pack all this up for you.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that was amazing, Mualani!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Haha, all in a day's work. By the way, Yelafath, are these two stones for sale?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 06.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' Interested? They won't come cheap.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I'm not planning to haggle this time, I promise. Package them separately, would you?
:{{DIcon}} Are those also decorations?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Nope. Kachina likes shiny little trinkets, so whenever I come across something like that, I always buy it for her.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I'll hold onto them for now. It'll be a nice, little surprise for her when she returns victorious from battle. I'm sure she'll like it.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 07.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' Alright, that should be everything. If you could just double-check &mdash; make sure nothing's missing.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Lemme see... Huh? What's this crate of juice doing here?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 08.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' That's on the house.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 09.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' Seven years ago, when the Abyss attacked our tribe, Atea saved my brother's life. She never asked for anything in return, but I could never forget what she did for my family that day.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 yelafath 10.ogg}} '''Yelafath:''' So, send her my regards, would you? And have fun!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, we will! It's gonna be a party to remember! Thanks a lot, Yelafath!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 5 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, that's our shopping done. Let's head back.

:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 hikueru 01.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' I would hope so. We spent all day clearing out debris from the bottom of the spring.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 hikueru 02.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' Did you guys get everything?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we brought back tons of stuff. We set it down near the cave entrance.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 marokau 01.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' Alright, then, roll up your sleeves, everyone, and let's get back to work!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Actually, why don't you two take a break. I'll handle it from here. {{Traveler}}, mind lending me a hand?
:{{DIcon}} Just say the word.
:{{DIcon}} How can I help?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So, I was brainstorming on the way over, and I'm thinking we could draw something on the wall over here, and the snacks and drinks can go over there...
:{{Black Screen|Under Mualani's direction, you give the abandoned spring a new look...}}
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So, what do you think? Not bad, right?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks amazing! Paimon had no idea you were such a great designer!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, I'm usually the one in charge of the family store, so I'm pretty good at things like renovation and organization.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Not to mention, this was totally a group effort... Still, I didn't expect it to take quite this long... Guess it's too late to invite Auntie Atea over, huh...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 hikueru 03.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' Yeah, tonight's definitely not gonna work. Chief Amina set up those patrols to guard against the Abyss, and Atea volunteered. So, she's on watch tonight.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I see. Well, guess the surprise will have to wait until tomorrow.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hmm... This could actually be a good thing. She can relieve all the exhaustion of keeping watch all night by soaking in the hot spring! She's gonna love it!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 6 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, let's call it a day, then! {{Traveler}}, Paimon, you must be tired, too. C'mon, I'll take you to the inn.

:{{A|vo ntaq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn*... Paimon's exhausted. We really went all over the place today, didn't we?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, we need to be well-rested for the party tomorrow, so let's head inside!

:{{A|vo ntaq003 9 amina 02.ogg}} '''Amina:''' We were prepared for an attack, but we didn't have enough people to prevent them from breaking through our defenses. No casualties so far, though.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 9 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Where'd they come from this time?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 9 amina 03.ogg}} '''Amina:''' The east side. We've pinpointed the position of an Abyssal Pylon, but we don't have enough manpower to take it down.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An Abyssal Pylon? What's that?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 9 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' A kind of "gate" created by the Abyss, one that allows monsters from the [[Night Kingdom]] to enter the physical world.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 9 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The only way to end the attack is to destroy the Pylon as soon as possible. Otherwise, the endless hoards of monsters will exhaust our defenses.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 9 amina 04.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Exactly, that's what I'm most concerned about. Their numbers suggest there might even be multiple Pylons in the area. We're searching for them as we speak...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 9 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, we'll go seal off the one to the east. {{Traveler}}, Paimon, can I count on your help again?

:{{A|vo ntaq003 10 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Besides, the Abyss doesn't care how difficult our lives are. Fighting back is the only option.

:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' ...!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' What is this? Some sort of purification? The Abyssal power... It's being cleansed away!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 hikueru 03.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' How can that be!?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 marokau 02.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' I never knew that was even possible...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 atea 08.ogg}} '''Atea:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 atea 09.ogg}} '''Atea:''' *coughing*
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Atea!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 atea 10.ogg}} '''Atea:''' The mark of the Abyss... It's gone...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yes, thanks to {{Traveler}}... By the way, are you alright?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I just saw you purify Abyssal power from Atea's body. That didn't injure you in any way, did it?
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You're sure?
:{{DIcon}} Of course.
:{{DIcon}} See?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Good, good...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 hikueru 04.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' Thank goodness!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 marokau 03.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' You scared us all half to death just now!
:{{Black Screen|A group of young tribespeople race over to surround you and Atea.}}
:{{Black Screen|They toss you into the air over and over, as if welcoming a triumphant hero.}}
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, everyone, head back and get some rest. We'll meet here tomorrow!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 16.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We'll celebrate Atea's recovery, and our triumph over the Abyss!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 17.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' And most importantly, we'll show {{Traveler}} and Paimon how grateful we are for their aid. Let's make it an occasion to remember! Dismissed!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 together 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' Got it!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 18.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Got any other secret powers I should know about, haha? But, seriously, you really came through for us tonight, so thank you.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon almost forgot you had that ability. You used it back in Mondstadt to cleanse [[Dvalin]]'s tears, didn't you?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was some quick thinking, {{Traveler}}... Huh? You look like something's bothering you. What's wrong?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I didn't want to spoil the mood earlier, but when I was purifying the Abyssal power within Atea, I could sense something...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Remnants of that power have existed within her body for years, corroding it from the inside...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I did my best to cleanse that power just now, but it's already deeply ingrained within her internal organs, leaving her as fragile as a dried leaf in the wind.)
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 mualani 19.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Abyssal power still exists within her body. Immersing herself in hot water would accelerate the corrosion of her internal organs and the progression of her illness.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 marokau 04.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' We think Auntie Atea's illness has taken a turn for the better.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 hikueru 05.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' She could never come into contact with hot water before, and now she's visiting the hot springs every night. I mean, it's pretty obvious what that means, right?
;(Flashback ends)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I don't think she was going to the hot springs because she was recovering, but because she realized her condition had taken a decisive turn for the worse... I'm just not sure if I should tell Mualani.)
:{{A|vo ntaq003 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hellooo! {{Traveler}}! Maybe you can zone out some other time, because Paimon can barely keep her eyes open. Let's head back for now.
:{{Black Screen|With doubts still lingering in your heart, you return to the inn to rest until the next morning. Until it's time for the hot spring party...}}<!--loading screen-->

;(Talk to Amina, optional)
:'''Amina:''' Phew... Thank you for your help. The Abyss has fled back to the Night Kingdom, and the water temperature's back to normal.
:'''Amina:''' Guess that means we've got multiple things to celebrate at this party!

;(Approach the hot springs)
:;(The Traveler sits alone as the others party)
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 01.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Not interested in hanging out with the other kids?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 02.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Snacks not to your taste? Hot spring temperature too high?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 03.ogg}} '''Atea:''' ...None of the above, huh? I heard you were the one who cleansed the Abyssal power yesterday... You sensed it, didn't you?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 04.ogg}} '''Atea:''' *sigh* I was hoping to keep it a secret for a few more days, didn't want to ruin the celebrations and all, but looks like it was no use... Hey, kid!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Who, me?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 05.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Yes, you. C'mon, let's go for a walk.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 hikueru 01.ogg}} '''Hikueru:''' Hey, where are you going? Did something happen?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 06.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Just going to get some air. It's too noisy in here.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 07.ogg}} '''Atea:''' You have fun &mdash; we'll be right back. Oh, and there are extra snacks in that box over there if they need replenishing. Baked them all fresh this the morning.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 marokau 01.ogg}} '''Marokau:''' Alright! Sounds great!
:{{Color|menu|Atea leads you to a quiet place...}}
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 08.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Mualani.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 09.ogg}} '''Atea:''' ...You've gotten so tall, you know that? Feels like just yesterday you were that rambunctious kid, causing trouble all around the hot springs. It's like all that time passed by in the blink of an eye...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 10.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Tell me, how are your parents?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' They're away on business... Seriously, Atea, what's going on? You're acting strange...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' {{Traveler}}, did something happen? Both of you seem a little off today...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 11.ogg}} '''Atea:''' I guess I should explain.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 12.ogg}} '''Atea:''' I wasn't visiting the hot springs because I was getting better. And that Pylon yesterday... I didn't go face it by myself because I was reckless, or too anxious to wait for reinforcements...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 13.ogg}} '''Atea:''' It's because my body isn't going to last much longer.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 14.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Your friend saved my life in that cave, and because of that, I got to enjoy this celebration with you all... But, I'm just a few days shy of the end.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 15.ogg}} '''Atea:''' The hot springs... I'm just trying to enjoy them for as long as I have left.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 16.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Mualani?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' "That better not happen again, whether I'm here to catch you or not" &mdash; that's what you said back at the artificial spring. I... had a bad feeling then, but I didn't want it to be true.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I... wanted to believe you were actually recovering...
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 17.ogg}} '''Atea:''' You wanna know something? Recovery, death... To me, the two aren't all that different. Both are worth celebrating.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 18.ogg}} '''Atea:''' You've never been resurrected, so you might not understand, but death and I? We're old pals by now. There's nothing sad about being reunited with an old friend.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 19.ogg}} '''Atea:''' I lived with regret for a long time... regret that my illness meant I could no longer take to the frontlines, especially as our nation slid deeper into crisis.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 20.ogg}} '''Atea:''' But, yesterday, I was finally able to let go of that regret. Not only because I found the strength to fight the Abyss, even at the end of my life... But because I got to see you in action, Mualani.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 21.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Seeing you out there... It made me realize that I don't need to worry about our tribe or our nation's future. You have the capacity to bring us all together.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 22.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Even if I was never injured, old age would still take me one day, but I've done what I needed to do &mdash; the future is in your hands now.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 23.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Just remember &mdash; whether in life or death, I am always with you.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I understand. Seems like you've given this a lot of thought, Atea. Thank you for telling me all this.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I'll do everything in my power to protect our tribe, our nation, and live up to the example you set for me.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 24.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Good... Oh, and, if any of you have the chance to meet with the Archon, could you give this to her for me?
:{{DIcon}} What is it?
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 25.ogg}} '''Atea:''' A talisman I've carried with me my whole life. It may seem strange to say while I'm still alive, but just think of it as a "relic" I'm leaving for her.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 26.ogg}} '''Atea:''' It's brought me good fortune in battle. Even after I became too sick to fight, I never took it off.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 27.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Just tell her it "embodies fond memories and my strength of will." She'll know what I'm trying to say.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Don't worry... We'll make sure she gets it.
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 28.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Alright, that's all I wanted to say. Let's head back to the party. No use spending what little time I have left being sad.
:;(They return to the party)
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, Atea, Mualani! If you don't hurry up, there won't be any snacks left!
:{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 29.ogg}} '''Atea:''' Excuse me, what did I say about bathing in the hot springs on a full stomach? Hey, are you listening to me&mdash;
:{{Color|menu|When she reaches your group, she pats Mualani on the shoulder lightly.}}
:{{Black Screen|Everyone has a great time amid the festive atmosphere. When it comes time to go, Atea says goodbye with a smile.}}
:{{Black Screen|When she reaches your group, she pats Mualani on the shoulder lightly.}}
:{{Black Screen|{{A|vo ntaq003 12 atea 30.ogg}} Atea: "Life is a journey in which there's no turning back, so forge ahead and don't hold back."}}
;(Obtain {{Item|Atea's Talisman}})

;(Talk to Atea, [[Niu]], and [[Anaa]], optional)
:'''Atea:''' How many times do I have to say it? No throwing stones into the hot spring!
:'''Niu:''' Okay, okay...
