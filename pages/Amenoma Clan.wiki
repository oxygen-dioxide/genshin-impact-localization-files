The '''Amenoma Clan''' is an [[Inazuma]]n clan and the one which [[Amenoma Tougo]] hails from. It was and continues to be the leader of the [[Amenoma Art]], one of the schools within the [[Raiden Gokaden]].

==History==
After [[Iwakura Michihiro]] defeated [[Teruyo]] in a duel, he had the Amenoma master at the time forge a blade that would be passed down to each inheritor of the "In" title. This blade, the "Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma," disappears following [[Iwakura Mitsunari]]'s death during the [[Iwakura Art's Downfall]], while the [[Amenoma Kageuchi]], a second copy of the sword, was given by Doukei to the [[Saimon Clan]] and is later given to the [[Traveler]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Amenoma Kageuchi}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Farmer's Treasure}}</ref>

The Amenoma Art is the only school that emerged completely unscathed during [[Scaramouche]]'s revenge plot against "the bladesmith," which likely refers to [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]], whom he came into conflict with at [[Tatarasuna]] around 500 years ago.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Calabash of Awakening}}</ref> It is continued in [[Amenoma Smithy]] owned by [[Amenoma Kageuchi]].
