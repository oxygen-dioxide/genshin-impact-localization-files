==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bracari:''' Perhaps I should grill a few more cookies for the children? Or perhaps that Bulle Fruit cake from the last time &mdash; that was pretty good.
:{{DIcon}} It certainly sounds tasty.
::'''Bracari:''' Hehe, as long as the children like it, all is well.
::'''Bracari:''' The adults here are very busy with work, so children often come and buy things for their families, and I bring them snacks when they do.
::'''Bracari:''' Sometimes that girl [[Navia]] drops by too, bringing gifts of all sizes. She asks for cake pretty often, too &mdash; just like a kid, she is...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Navia...
:::'''Bracari:''' I'm an old acquaintance of her father. Got a hand in her marksmanship, too, if I do say so myself.
:::'''Bracari:''' Of course, she didn't learn it here. This place is too small &mdash; any drawing of weapons isn't going to end well for anyone.
:::'''Bracari:''' If someone does dare cause trouble here, they will be sent away to start a new life in the ocean.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Bracari:''' Take care, and mind you don't fall down!
