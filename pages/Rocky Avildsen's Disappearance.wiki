==Text==
[[File:Rocky Avildsen's Disappearance Map.png|300px]]

He achieved nothing, he loved no one. He wasted his life in the duelists' ring.<br>
After decades of living like that, [[Rocky Avildsen]] found everything he owned usurped by his butler, [[Brandt]].<br>
His assets and reputation now belonging to another, he went to self-imposed exile.<br>
He dedicated the remainder of his life to his selfless friends, in pursuit of their dreams.

Friend, you who know of his journey, even be it from accidentally finding this letter,<br>
Or because you have come to discover his fate for the Avildsen family's glory,<br>
{{color|buzzword|Go and collect his assets}}, his final gift to the world.
