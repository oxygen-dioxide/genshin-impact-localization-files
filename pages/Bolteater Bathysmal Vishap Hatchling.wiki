{{Description|A vishap that dwells deep beneath the oceans. Due to certain social adaptations, it has manifested a form aligned with the Electro element.<br />Following the fading of the Seven Sovereigns' power, a new generation of Sovereigns is presently being born. But now that the Bathysmal Vishaps have evolved in this manner, they have lost their purity. As such, the Dragon of Water will no longer be born from among their ranks. Prophecy holds that the new Dragon of Water will definitely descend in the form of a human.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
''Attack names are unofficial except for Cleansing Shower.''

* '''Cleansing Shower:''' Forms an orb within their mouth and launches it at the player. On hit, the orb deals '''5% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} and drains 10 [[Energy]] from the active character. If the active character has less than 10 Energy, inflicts [[HP Loss]].
** The HP Loss is calculated as:<br /><math>\text{HP Loss} = ( 14 \% \times \text{Character Max HP} + 200 ) \times ( 1 - \frac{\text{Remaining Energy}}{10} )</math>
* '''Spinning Sweep:''' Curls up and quickly spins, dealing '''30% ATK * 2''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.
* '''Homing Shards:''' Launches three shards from its tail that home towards the player at high speed, dealing '''30% ATK''', '''15% ATK''', '''7.5% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* '''Slash Combo:''' If the player is within melee range, performs 2 horizontal slashes followed by a downward smash, dealing '''30% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''80% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Physical DMG}} with each hit.

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet all of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
