==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Ishikawa is a soldier under the leadership of General [[Kujou Masahito]]. During the civil war against the Resistance, he saw the carnage of war. But with his phobia of blood, he often would faint and almost miss joining in the battle field. Because of this experience he was easily convinced to desert the army by his fellow soldier [[Saimon Jirou]]. On the night that Jirou and Ishikawa planned to desert the army, [[Ogura Yuu]], saw the two rookie soldiers and sounded the alarm. Shocked by the noise, Ishikawa tripped and fell. Only Jirou successfully left while Ishikawa failed and was punished by eating barrack ration for days.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Searching for Saimon Jirou}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Ishikawa wears a standard uniform modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray ''shitagi'', lavender ''kobakama'', white socks, and ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with pale gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''kote'' (armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'' (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing)
:'''Ishikawa:''' Hmm? A traveler like you shouldn't be in a place like this. Are you lost?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Ishikawa:''' Oh, I'm just an ordinary new recruit who never wanted to go to war or join the military. However, I was born into a samurai family, so the choice wasn't mine to make. It's my duty to join the military and go to war for the sake of my family's honor.
::'''Ishikawa:''' What's annoying is that this war keeps dragging on... The battlefield is not like training... It's a place of life or death.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ishikawa:''' See you. I really hope this war ends soon...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing)
:'''Ishikawa:''' Hmm? A traveler like you shouldn't be in a place like this. Are you lost?
:{{DIcon}} And who are you?
::'''Ishikawa:''' Oh, I'm just an ordinary new recruit who never wanted to go to war or join the military. Due to my family background, however, the choice wasn't mine to make.
::'''Ishikawa:''' Well, at least the Shogunate and Sangonomiya have agreed to a ceasefire, eh?
::'''Ishikawa:''' I mean, war isn't like training. It's real swords and spears that are clashing out there.
::'''Ishikawa:''' This might seem like a joke, but despite my samurai status, I get faint at the sight of blood. I nearly didn't make it off the battlefield several times.
::'''Ishikawa:''' I can only hope that by the Electro Archon's grass, this ceasefire between the two sides will be a permanent one.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ishikawa:''' Goodbye. Ah, would that this ceasefire would last a little longer...
