==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing)
:'''Ishikawa:''' Hmm? A traveler like you shouldn't be in a place like this. Are you lost?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Ishikawa:''' Oh, I'm just an ordinary new recruit who never wanted to go to war or join the military. However, I was born into a samurai family, so the choice wasn't mine to make. It's my duty to join the military and go to war for the sake of my family's honor.
::'''Ishikawa:''' What's annoying is that this war keeps dragging on... The battlefield is not like training... It's a place of life or death.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ishikawa:''' See you. I really hope this war ends soon...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing)
:'''Ishikawa:''' Hmm? A traveler like you shouldn't be in a place like this. Are you lost?
:{{DIcon}} And who are you?
::'''Ishikawa:''' Oh, I'm just an ordinary new recruit who never wanted to go to war or join the military. Due to my family background, however, the choice wasn't mine to make.
::'''Ishikawa:''' Well, at least the Shogunate and Sangonomiya have agreed to a ceasefire, eh?
::'''Ishikawa:''' I mean, war isn't like training. It's real swords and spears that are clashing out there.
::'''Ishikawa:''' This might seem like a joke, but despite my samurai status, I get faint at the sight of blood. I nearly didn't make it off the battlefield several times.
::'''Ishikawa:''' I can only hope that by the Electro Archon's grass, this ceasefire between the two sides will be a permanent one.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ishikawa:''' Goodbye. Ah, would that this ceasefire would last a little longer...
