'''Elemental Nodes''' and '''Infusion Stones''' are objects that imbue nearby enemies with elemental buffs. They appear in certain [[Domains]] and some parts of the [[Teyvat]] overworld. They can appear in domains that do not have [[Ley Line Disorders]] like Floor 12 of the Version 1.5 Spiral Abyss, and they have somewhat different effects from [[Auras]]. Unlike Elemental Nodes, Infusion Stones can be broken.

Elemental Nodes usually start in a closed state, and when the challenge starts, they open up and pulse periodically, buffing enemies within range.

==Buffs==
{{See also|Elemental Gauge Theory}}
Nodes pulse once every 15 seconds, buffing all enemies in range:<ref name="Node Element Buffs">NGA: [https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=27153300&_ff=650 《元素地脉学》 - 角色自身附着、环境与敌人的特殊技能、元素增幅器]</ref>
* '''Un-buffed''' enemies gain '''3.6''' [[gauge unit]]s of the node's element.
** Unlike elemental gauges applied by characters' talents and most other elemental sources, the gauge from the node's buff does '''not''' decay over time and instead lasts until depleted by [[Elemental Reactions]].
** The pulse will trigger an Elemental Reaction first if the enemy already has an elemental gauge of a different element.
** '''Corresponding''' elements which are not from nodes do '''not''' affect the buff, whether before or during buffing.
* '''Buffed''' enemies gain an additional '''1.2''' gauge units.
** The '''max available gauge''' of this buff is 3.6 units.
* Once an enemy's buff gauge is fully depleted, the enemy '''cannot''' regain the buff in the next '''2''' pulses.

Until the Elemental Gauge is depleted, enemies will gain 50% [[RES]] to all damage types along with an additional 50% RES to the node's element. They will also gain increased [[Interruption Resistance]] with a hyperarmor multiplier of '''0.01''' and another bonus based on the node's element:<ref name="Node Element Buffs" />

*{{Cryo}}: '''+100%''' [[DEF]]
**This DEF increase is additive with other DEF modifiers (such as DEF reduction talents from characters).
**For example, if the enemy is in the Cryo-enhanced state, and [[Razor]] uses his skill to reduce their DEF by 15%, then the DEF of the enemy is multiplied by <math>2 - 0.15 = 1.85</math>.

*{{Pyro}}: '''+40%''' [[ATK]]
**This ATK increase is additive with other ATK modifiers.
**For example, after the enemy gets the Pyro-enhanced state, [[Diona]] uses her [[Drunkards' Farce|4th Ascension Passive]] to reduce their ATK by 10%, and the ATK of the enemy is multiplied by <math>1 + 0.4 - 0.10 = 1.3</math>.

*{{Electro}}: '''+50%''' [[Cooldown Reduction]]
**This effect can be observed on some enemies such as [[Electro Cicin Mage]]s, increasing the rate at which they are able to use their Supercharged Shield attack, but it is not yet known exactly which other enemies and attacks it affects.

==Infusion Stones==
'''Infusion Stones''' buff enemies the same way as the Elemental Nodes in Domains, but the infusion stones are vulnerable to damage and can be destroyed to immediately remove their [[Auras]] and buffs from enemies.

The [[Mutation Stone]]s in the event [[Energy Amplifier Initiation]] also greatly buffed the enemies' offense, defense, and [[Interruption Resistance]]. Like other infusion stones, they could be broken.

{{Pyro}} and {{Electro}} Infusion Stones are considered {{Color|[[Geo Constructs]]}} and are weakest to [[Blunt Attack]]s. {{Cryo}} Infusion Stones are {{Cryo}} objects that are weakest to {{Pyro}}.
