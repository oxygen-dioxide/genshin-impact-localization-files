{{Description|Olah! Hello, Travelers~<br>Today, we will be introducing [[Faruzan]], a household name in Haravatat!<br>There is a legend circulating among the Kshahrewar students: if you have failed your mechanics exams and do not dare ask for remedial lessons from your displeased tutor, you can make your way to Haravatat next door and ask "the living encyclopedia of mechanics" Madam Faruzan for some tips.  Faruzan has significant knowledge of ancient scripts and machines of all kinds. Are there areas that particularly interest you? Come and share them with Faruzan!}}
