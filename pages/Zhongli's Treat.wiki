==Summary==
You meet [[Zhongli]] at a restaurant called [[Third-Round Knockout]], listening to a story told by [[Iron Tongue Tian]]. As you listen, the camera pans to [[Ganyu]], looking out over [[Liyue Harbor]] from above. Iron Tongue Tian's story is about [[Ningguang]]: He says that she has three research assistants who gather a lot of papers for research, and Ningguang shreds the papers and scatters them to the wind, where they fall and settle all over Liyue Harbor.

After the story, a stranger approaches. She introduces herself as [[Ganyu]], emissary of the [[Liyue Qixing]] and secretary at the [[Yuehai Pavilion]]. She is currently serving as Ningguang's special emissary, and offers a letter of formal invitation to Ningguang's palace in the sky.

Zhongli makes plans to meet you at [[Dihua Marsh]] after you're done speaking to Ningguang in the [[Jade Chamber]].

==Steps==
# Wait until the appointed time (18:00-23:00)
#* You may use the clock to speed up the time
# Go to Third-Round Knockout
#* It is located across the Teleport Waypoint near the Adventurers' Guild.
# Sit next to Zhongli

==Achievements==
* Completing this quest will grant the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Farewell, Archaic Lord (Achievement)|Farewell, Archaic Lord]]."

;(After sitting next to Zhongli)
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, you're here. There's no need to order, I've already done so.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' "Third-Round Knockout" is not for lightweights, like those taverns in Mondstadt. Here, the owner does not take such unorthodox orders as fruit juice.
:{{DIcon}} So, does this mean I can order wine this time?
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I ordered some wine-fermented sweet rice balls for you, if that counts.
:{{DIcon}} I guess I should have expected this...
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 irontonguetian 01.ogg}} '''Iron Tongue Tian:''' ...If it's to your liking, dear customers, I shall continue the tale of Lady Ningguang's Jade Chamber.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, there's even a storyteller here! Great atmosphere!
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Besides the fine wine, the excellent ambiance is the reason why this place is so well loved.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But, when I say ambiance, I refer to a different sort from the one the [[Teyvat Travel Guide - Liyue|Teyvat Travel Guide]] uses to judge other establishments.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 irontonguetian 02.ogg}} '''Iron Tongue Tian:''' As you all know, high above the land of Liyue lies a pavilion in the clouds, a palace in the mist...
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 irontonguetian 03.ogg}} '''Iron Tongue Tian:''' What does it mean to have all-seeing eyes? This, my friends: Lady Ningguang's masterwork that bridges earth and sky.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 irontonguetian 04.ogg}} '''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Imagine. The weather is clear, and you gaze down from the deck on the world below...
:{{A|vo lyaq107 2 irontonguetian 05.ogg}} '''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Behold! The glorious sights of Liyue Harbor, stretching out far and wide!

;(A cinematic begins)
{{Cutscene Description|Iron Tongue Tian grows animated as he broaches the topic of Tianquan Ningguang's palace in the sky, the Jade Chamber. All become fascinated by the Tianquan as he tells her tale of ultra-secretive scheming and "paper snow..."}}
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' They say that when Lady Ningguang ponders important affairs, she retreats to her Jade Chamber with none but her three closest confidantes in tow. Why brings she these trusted three? To sift through sources, dig through documents &mdash; looking for information.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Piece by piece, facts and figures paint a picture on the walls of the chamber... But well before the wall is filled, Lady Ningguang's mind is made up.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Having made her call, she has every last document shredded. And fwoosh! she scatters the shavings out her window.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Ah, look at them! How they billow in the wind like a sudden swirling blizzard! As the fragments fall, traces of text flicker before the eyes of the merchants of Liyue like ink stains in white snow.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' The saying goes, the rarest treasures in the land are the words brought by the paper snow. For the words of the Tianquan have the power to move mountains and all throughout the land know it.
----
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 irontonguetian 01.ogg}} '''Iron Tongue Tian:''' These are but scraps of paper, and yet they guide Lady Ningguang's hand &mdash; such is their value.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 irontonguetian 02.ogg}} '''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Merely grasping one or two of them will surely gift you a fragment of her wisdom &mdash; enough to stay a step or two ahead of your peers.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tianquan Ningguang... feels like we're hearing this name a lot.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Liyue locals talk about her, the [[Fatui]] hate her, she's most likely the one who hid the Exuvia, and we saw her at the Rite of Descension...
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders what sort of person she is.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''???:''' At last, I have found you, you who returned from Jueyun Karst.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who's there?
:{{DIcon}} (Paimon, we gotta go...!)
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Wait, I am not with the Millelith, nor am I here to claim your bounty!
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' However, I am an emissary of the Liyue Qixing. My name is Ganyu, secretary at the Yuehai Pavilion, and I have come specifically to meet you.
:{{DIcon}} Emissary?
:{{DIcon}} Secretary?
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Well, in concrete terms, I am the corporate secretary for the Qixing. At the moment, I am serving as Lady Ningguang's special emissary.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ningguang sent you? We were literally just talking about her...
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' My apologies, you who have returned from Jueyun Karst... I am duty-bound, and cannot extend my courtesy to you in full.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But I have with me a letter from lady Ningguang. She extends a formal invitation to you in her capacity as Tianquan.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' She invites you to her palace in the sky.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An official invitation...?
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Lady Ningguang said this:
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 09a.ogg}} {{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 09b.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' "Invite (him/her) to come here."
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 10a.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' "I wish to meet (him/her)."
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 ganyu 11a.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' "At the Jade Chamber, together, we shall snip every one of these entwining dark threads."
;(Black)
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And with that, the emissary who called herself Ganyu just disappeared.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But we've received an invitation from the Liyue Qixing. Paimon still can't believe it!
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler)! We'll be meeting people that have any more money than Paimon could ever count! We should be on our very best manners!
:{{DIcon}} I always mind my manners.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon is up to something again...
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hah... An invitation to visit the Jade Chamber is a rare honor, indeed.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You'd best be on your way now. But don't forget about the [[Rite of Parting]]. Once you've finished at the Jade Chamber, meet me at Dihua Marsh.
:{{A|vo lyaq107 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we won't forget! Dihua Marsh. We'll see you there!

;(Talk to Zhongli again)
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq107 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ningguang... Ganyu...
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq107 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I wonder where we will find them amid these dark tides?
