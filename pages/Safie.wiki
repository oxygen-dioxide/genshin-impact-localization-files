==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Safie:''' Hello! Are you going to Sumeru City? Do you need a bodyguard? I was the one who escorted [[Gohar]] into the city!
:{{DIcon}} I don't need one. Thanks.
::'''Safie:''' Whoa, you're confident. If you're that strong, why don't you join [[the Eremites]]?
::'''Safie:''' You'll have a pretty good life if you can handle security jobs or escorting cargos.
::'''Safie:''' I think Brother [[Aybak]] is doing it for our safety, but he always gives us jobs that don't require traveling to the city or facing any danger.
::'''Safie:''' I can't deny that it's easy, but it's so boring! Even window shopping and counting [[Harra Fruit]]s would be more interesting than those commissions.
:{{DIcon}} Gohar?
::'''Safie:''' Oh, sorry. I forgot outsiders don't know about Gohar.
::'''Safie:''' She is a beautiful lady that everyone here in Caravan Ribat likes. Whoever meets her can't help but say a few words of praise to her.
::'''Safie:''' It's a pity you can't get to meet her in person. Some weeks ago, she received a letter from a [[Dusk Bird]], then she asked me to send her to Sumeru City.
::'''Safie:''' It was so much fun...! Um, I mean, it was an unforgettable work experience!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Safie:''' See you. Let me know if you come across any commissions in Sumeru City!
