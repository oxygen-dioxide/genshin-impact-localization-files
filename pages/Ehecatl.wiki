'''Ehecatl''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|The Frozen, Rekindling Land}}. 

It is a [[Secret Source Servant]] with advanced communicative capabilities. Its name is taken from a list of the deceased, likely those who fell in the war between [[Xiuhcoatl]] and [[Xbalanque]].

After helping the [[Traveler]] unseal the Sacred City of Tollan, Ehecatl deactivates and turns into the item {{Item|That Which Was Once Ehecatl}}. Returning it to the [[Fallingstar Fields|Tephric Ruins]] grants the {{Achievement|Why Is It Always a Statue Mechanism?}}.

==Profile==
Ehecatl once served the [[dragon]]s in the Sacred City of Tollan. At some point, likely after the fall of Tollan, it found its way to the Tephric Ruins and entered a dormant state. During the events of ''The Frozen, Rekindling Land'', a [[Qucusaur]] snatches it from the ruins and carries it into the [[Ancient Sacred Mountain]]. The Traveler follows the Qucusaur in and encounters Ehecatl, who briefly awakens and guides them to unseal the City of Tollan, before running out of energy and deactivating once more.

===Appearance===
Ehecatl looks like a standard Secret Source Servant.
