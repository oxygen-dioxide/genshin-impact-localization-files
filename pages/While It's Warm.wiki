[[Good Hunter]], [[Wangshu Inn]], and [[Wanmin Restaurant]] are currently facing a high volume of orders. They don't have enough delivery staff to cover them all and are looking for help.

During this event, fulfill timed food delivery orders from [[Sara]] at [[Good Hunter]], [[Smiley Yanxiao]] at [[Wangshu Inn]], and [[Chef Mao]] at [[Wanmin Restaurant]] to receive rewards &mdash; and complete all daily orders to get [[Primogem]]s!

This event is available for players at [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above.

==Event Duration==
2020-12-11 10:00:00 – 2020-12-18 03:59:59

==Event Details==
During the event period, Travelers can take timed food delivery orders from [[Sara]] at [[Good Hunter]], [[Smiley Yanxiao]] at [[Wangshu Inn]], and [[Chef Mao]] at [[Wanmin Restaurant]] via the event menu.

Food must be delivered within the specified time limit and without breaking any other conditions that may apply depending on the food in question (see the list below). Breaking these conditions will ruin the food, in which case Travelers will have to acquire a fresh portion and restart the delivery.

3 delivery orders will be available per day, refreshing at 04:00 daily.

Each order comes with a few special requirements, such as:
*Deliver within the time limit (the timer does not pause during teleport transitions)
*No sprinting
**"fast swimming" is allowed
*No gliding
*No climbing
**"ledge grabbing" (to pull the character up) is allowed
*Do not take DMG (from any source)
*Do not become affected by any element
**Any source of an element (including self applied) will fail the quest
**In case of rain, advance the time through the clock menu until the weather clears
**Pools of water can be iced over and stood upon without getting wet.

Teleporting is allowed and necessary. Additionally in case of an order being too frustrating for you, consider using a [[Portable Waypoint]] at the target's location to instantly "skip" the run.

==Delivery Orders==
Completing all 3 orders for each day rewards players with {{Item|Primogem|30|x=60}} per set/day.
