==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before unlocking ''[[The Chasm Delvers]]''.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Muning:''' May I ask for your name?
:{{DIcon}} Why, hello there...
:{{DIcon}} I'm...
:'''Muning:''' My apologies, but The Chasm has been closed indefinitely. We do not take guests here.
:'''Muning:''' Unless...
:{{DIcon}} Unless...?
:'''Muning:''' Unless you can get permission from Yujing Terrace... Or if you are on a {{color|buzzword|special commission}}.
:'''Muning:''' However, things have been quite unusual lately, and our bosses have been most busy... I'd advise that you mind your own business, lest you disturb them.
:'''Muning:''' Please leave at once. This is for your own safety.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''[[Says He Who Seeks Stone]]''.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Muning:''' What? You seriously broke the Seven-Star Array? Ugh, looks like I'll have to write this into the weekly report...
:{{DIcon}} Make sure you make it sound cool, alright?
:'''Muning:''' *cough* Please, this is a very serious situation. It's so serious, in fact, that the Qixing themselves will decide its exact seriousness.
:'''Muning:''' Which is to say that once report gets sent up, someone from the Qixing might personally come down here to stop you.
:'''Muning:''' Even I won't be able to save you then.
:{{DIcon}} (This guy is way too obvious with his hints...)
:'''Muning:''' Scared, huh? Alright, move along, then! There's still someone waiting for you, you know?
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after completing ''[[Muning's Never-Ending Needs]]''.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Muning:''' How is everything down there? Did you encounter any danger?
:{{DIcon}} (You describe your experiences to Muning.)
::'''Muning:''' Ah, I see. That does sound rather dangerous. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to help take care of Jinwu and Zhiqiong, then.
::{{DIcon}} Aren't you supposed to stop me?
::'''Muning:''' Well, that is my duty, yes. But you always run off too quickly for me to stop you, so I can't.
::{{DIcon}} I don't run that fast.
::'''Muning:''' No, you do. That's what the report says, and what the report says is the truth.
::{{DIcon}} Alright, guess I'm really, really fast, then.
::'''Muning:''' Exactly. As such, please do be careful.
:{{DIcon}} All goes well, don't you fret.
::'''Muning:''' That's good, that's good. As long as things go well, the Qixing will have no reason to come down too hard on me...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #4===
''Available after completing ''[[Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?]]''.''{{verify}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Muning:''' Resumption of work for the miners and provisions for their food, the changing of Millelith guards, contract signings, equipment overhauls, and weekly reports...
:'''Muning:''' Ah, it's you. Do you need me to help with anything else? I mean, I am a bit... busy, right now, but...
:{{DIcon}} You're that busy, huh?
::'''Muning:''' You bet. There's so much work to be done that I reckon that I'll start losing hair over it soon.
::'''Muning:''' But there's nothing for it: the resumption of work at The Chasm is good for Liyue as a whole, of that there is no doubt. But the deluge of work will always have to be taken up by an unfortunate few.
::'''Muning:''' Still, you have my thanks. Things are busy here, sure, but it's much improved from how things were when it was just Zhiqiong and a couple others.
::{{DIcon}} How's Zhiqiong? ''(Unlocked after completing ''[[Valor's Afterglow: The Faint Light Remembered]]'')''
:::'''Muning:''' Ah yes. About Zhiqiong, the Millelith should have received news about her. If nothing goes awry, the search-and-rescue team from Ministry should also arrive soon.
:::'''Muning:''' We should have news of her shortly.
:::'''Muning:''' That said, she's so fond of adventure that she probably went gallivanting somewhere by herself. *cough* If you meet her out there, please be sure to tell me.
:::'''Muning:''' I'm sure you must be much busier than me, but you know, it would be nice if you could look out for her on my behalf...
:::{{DIcon}} I will.
:::'''Muning:''' Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you.
::{{DIcon}} What's the situation with Zhiqiong?
::;(After {{tx}})
<!-- Probably a while after Valor's Afterglow: The Faint Light Remembered -->
:::'''Muning:''' The search-and-rescue team hasn't had news of her yet. But please don't panic... This isn't the time to panic just yet.
:::'''Muning:''' We should have news of her shortly.
:::'''Muning:''' As for me, I believe that she's still alive. Adventurers are a tough lot, so she shouldn't... Um, sorry...
:::'''Muning:''' *cough* But if you do meet her out there, please be sure to tell me.
:::{{DIcon}} I will.
:::'''Muning:''' Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you.
:{{DIcon}} I don't need help at the moment.
::'''Muning:''' Phew. Well, that's good.
::'''Muning:''' Not that I don't want to help you, obviously, but I'm just... a bit swamped at the moment.
::'''Muning:''' The Feiyun Commerce Guild's representative just left, and now we need to send people to put up recruitment notices for miners.
::'''Muning:''' Once we're done here, I'm gonna apply for some leave.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Muning:''' See you. Again, the Ministry of Civil Affairs thanks you for your efforts.
