==Descriptions==
{{Description|A tavern close to the liveliest street of Sumeru City, "Treasures Street." Its owner, Lambad, claims to be a legendary sailor who used to sail far and wide. It is rather difficult to tell how exaggerated that claim is, but judging from the food sold in the Tavern, at least the part about the cuisines seems credible.|[[Map]] description}}
