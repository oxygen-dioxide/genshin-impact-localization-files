'''Nightsoul Totems''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]].

Strange obsidian totems scattered across the nation. Touching these totems will send the player to the [[Night Kingdom]] to attempt a trial.

The trial consists of a single [[Local Legend]] with the "Night's Trial" effect, which provides an additional effect during the trial. If the player has not selected the right team upon touching the totem, they can initiate and then cancel the challenge to change their team, as they will be allowed to attempt the challenge again or leave the Night Kingdom.

Varying [[achievement]]s from the [[Duelist: Series I]], [[Duelist: Series II]] and [[Duelist: Series III]] require accessing and completing the Nightsoul Totem challenges per the requirements for the respective achievement. When all corresponding achievements for that trial are achieved, the Nightsoul Totem will emit a yellow spiral of energy.

All Wayob Proxies linked to the trials are visible from any trial. The appearance of each proxy will change within the Night Kingdom after each of its three achievements is completed, reflecting the progress made.

==Trials==
===Ichcahuipilli's Aegis===
* Trial Location: [[Basin of Unnumbered Flames]], [[Huitztli Hill]]
* Other requirements: A short puzzle must be completed to unlock the totem
* Night's Trial:
** Trial of Decisions: During this trial, the Foliar-Swift Wayob Manifestation will '''exile''' the character to a Land of Decision, where you must touch a Nightsoul Fault to leave the Land and return to battle against the Manifestation.
** When the Land of Decision is activated, the Foliar-Swift Wayob will summon Nightsoul Warriors onto the field to do battle. Defeating them will bestow the "Curse" effect. Each stack of "Curse" increases the DMG dealt by all party members, but will also cause them to continuously lose HP. "Curse" can stack up to 15 times.

===Ironbeard===
* Location: [[Quahuacan Cliff]], northeast from the [["Flower-Feather Clan"]]
* Night's Trial:
** Trial of Initiative: During this trial, the opponent will strike the ground to create "Molten Barbs." {{Geo}} attacks and Plunging Attacks are both effective at destroying Molten Barbs, and of the two methods, destroying Molten Barbs with Plunging Attacks will create explosions and dealt DMG to opponents. If you do not destroy the Molten Barbs in time, the opponent will destroy them, and deal damage to characters on the field.

===Potapo's Solidarity===
* Location: [[Tezcatepetonco Range]], west from the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]
* Night's Trial: 
** Trial of Coordination: In this trial, Biting-Cold Wayob Manifestations will be "Protection Spirits" or "Hostile Spirits." Of the two types, the Protection Spirit will create a spirit connection with the character, and when each member of the party receives healing, HP will be recovered for the Protection Spirit. When the Protection Spirit's HP is fully restored, it will use the coordinated attack "Pierce: Binding of Dawn and Dusk's Breaking" to attack the Hostile Spirit. At this time, the more HP is restored to the Protection Spirit, the greater the damage that will be dealt, until finally Pierce: Binding of Dawn and Dusk's Breaking can be transformed into the more powerful Decisive: Binding of Dawn and Dusk's Breaking.

* Night's Trial:
** Trial of Scorchwind: In this trial, after reaching a certain stage in battle, the Burning-Aflame Wayob Manifestation will recite an incantation to summon an infernal skyfire that covers the entire field. You can use the remaining Gaseous Phlogiston Current on the field to dodge attacks, and if at this time you use the power of the wind currents to attack the Burning-Aflame Wayob Manifestation, the incantation to summon the skyfire will be interrupted.

* Night's Trial:
** Trial of Tundra: In this trial, when characters get close to the sacrificial brazier, they will receive "Burning Blessing," causing Charged Attacks to deal extra {{Pyro}} DMG. After reaching a certain stage in battle, the Iktomisaurus will take flight and grant itself a {{Cryo}} Ward, freezing the sacrificial brazier, and for a period of time after, continually execute powerful attacks. During this time, you can use {{Pyro}} attacks to melt the tough ice covering the sacrificial brazier, and characters from the Masters of the Night-Wind can use Nightspirit Graffiti to directly create a new sacrificial brazier and receive Burning Blessing.

===Tupu's Lushness===
* Location: Atocpan, north of a [[Teleport Waypoint]]
* Night's Trial:
** Feuding Trial: In this trial, the Thundering Wayob Manifestation will continuously maintain a highly resistant "Thunderous Rebuke" state. "Duskgrace Orbs" will occasionally spawn in the arena. Collect as many orbs as possible to manifest a "Duskgrace Altar" that follows the active character, and can dispel the monster's "Thunderous Rebuke" state. The Thundering Wayob Manifestation may also absorb these orbs to create an Electro Ward for itself. A certain duration after the challenge beings, the Thundering Wayob Manifestation will summon several "Duskgrace Orbs" and pull them towards itself. By collecting as many "Duskgrace Orbs" as possible, you can create a strong "Pilgrim's Shield" for yourself to defend against the monster's highly damaging skills.
