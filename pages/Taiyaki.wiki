|description     = A snack shaped like a snapper.
|desc_suspicious = The filling is way too sweet, with a single small bite leaving you in dire need of some water to wash it all down. Even the sweetest of teeth will find stomaching this a rather tall order.
|desc_basic      = The crisp exterior wraps the sweet filling within and is very popular amongst Inazumans. It is said that in the beginning, this was just a cylindrical snack, but constant improvements wound up shaping it into the cutesy image of a fish.
|desc_delicious  = Fresh out of the oven, this taiyaki gives off a titillating aroma while it is still a mite scalding to the touch. A single bite causes the sweetness to melt in your mouth instantly. The feeling is akin to watching a fish in a pool bathed in sunset's gleam, it's scales attaining a golden sheen.
