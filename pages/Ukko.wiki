'''Ukko''' is a character mentioned in [[Princess' Box]]. It is unclear who exactly Ukko is, but based on the description of the Princess' Box and the lack of other unnamed contemporary significant figures, it is likely he is the scribe of [[Sal Vindagnyr]]. The contents of the [[Scribe's Box]] appear to be told from his point of view.

==Story==
Ukko appears to have been close to the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|Princess]] during their lifetimes, and was suspicious of her relationship with the outlander [[Imunlaukr]]. This became especially apparent after the [[Skyfrost Nail]] descended, as he believed Imunlaukr had deserted them.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Scribe's Box}}</ref>

He was the last survivor of Sal Vindagnyr's fall. It is likely he was [[Ancient Carvings|the one who found and buried the Princess]] after she died trying to graft an Irminsul Tree branch onto a healthy tree.

===Legacy===
A respawning [[Frostarm Lawachurl]] on Dragonspine can be fought with a boss HP bar and the name "Ukko".<ref group="Note">There is never an explicit connection made or otherwise hinted at between the Ukko and the Lawachurl Ukko, aside from their shared uncommon name. However, the Archon Quest ''[[The Grave of the Guarded]]'' reveals that many hilichurls are from the destroyed nation of [[Khaenri'ah]], and the [[Hilichurl]] Archive description says that hilichurls are known to have existed for over a thousand years, thus making it possible for the Ukko of Sal Vindagnyr and the Lawachurl Ukko to be the same.</ref>
