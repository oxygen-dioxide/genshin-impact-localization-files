'''Ukko''' is a character mentioned in the [[Princess' Box]] who lived thousands of years ago during the final days of the [[Sal Vindagnyr]] civilization.

While Ukko's significance has never been specified, the Princess' Box description and a lack of other unnamed contemporary significant figures suggests that he was also the scribe of Sal Vindagnyr, a figure who provides the quotations in the [[Scribe's Box]] and the [[Ancient Carvings]].

==Story==
Ukko appears to have been close to the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr]] during their lifetimes, given that she apologizes to him in her thoughts for having to "see us like this."<ref>{{Ref/Item|Princess' Box}}</ref> In turn, Ukko appears to have been somewhat protective over the Princess, condemning [[Imunlaukr]] as "that outsider who abandoned the princess,"<ref>{{Ref/Item|Scribe's Box}}</ref> unaware that the outlander had never given up on his search for a way to end the disaster brought about by the [[Skyfrost Nail]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Broken Rime's Echo|quote=But in the end, the hero who stepped out into the snow would not return in time.<br>He would stand accused of flight by hateful words long ground to dust amid the snowstorms...}}</ref>

He was the last survivor of Sal Vindagnyr's fall and recorded their downfall in the Ancient Carvings. Based on this, he was also the one who found and buried the Princess after she died trying to graft an [[Irminsul]] branch onto a healthy tree.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Dragonspine's Glacial Secret|s=Ancient Carvings}}</ref> His bitterness over their fate is recorded in the Scribe's Box description where, among his other hopes for the world's destruction, he alluded to [[Khaenri'ah]] as "a new nation without gods" which he hoped would "have the power to stand against this world."

===Legacy===
A respawning [[Frostarm Lawachurl]] on Dragonspine can be fought with a boss HP bar and the name "Ukko."<ref group="Note">While there is no explicit connection between the scribe Ukko and the Lawachurl Ukko, their shared uncommon name and presence on Dragonspine, combined with Ukko's vocal hatred of the world and the gods at Sal Vindagnyr's end, makes it likely that he was afflicted with the curse which transforms people into hilichurls as punishment for forsaking their god. This curse and its nature is attested to in ''[[Perinheri]]'', and was laid on all non-pure-blooded [[Khaenri'ah]]ns during the [[cataclysm]].</ref>
