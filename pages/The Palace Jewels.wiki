|desc_suspicious = The roughly processed shrimp and half-cooked crab roe give off an odd smell, reeking of the charnel stench of some brutal crab-shrimp war. Considering that the raw ingredients themselves are still quite fresh, this shambling nightmare could still be classified as food... if one were to ignore the stink, anyway.
|desc_basic      = Shrimp meat is battered and cooked with rich crab roe. The roe is as radiant gold, while the shrimp sparkles like jade, hence the name "The Palace Jewels."
|desc_delicious  = Soft, smooth crab meat is wrapped in tender, chewy shrimp meat, like a luxurious treasure that people unconsciously reach for. One delicate bite fills your mouth with flavor, like waves billowing across your palate as you float in a delicious river of shrimp and crab.
