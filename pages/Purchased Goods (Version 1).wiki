|description  = Items that Nilou bought for the Zubayr Theater. Apart from materials for making performance props, there are other items here that either fall under daily use or celebratory purposes. It would be too much of a burden for one person to move this stuff themselves, but an experienced adventurer would probably know how to handle that...
