|text      = Couple days ago while I was dining in the Wanmin Restaurant, a "friend of rock" from Fontaine recognized me and asked for an autograph! But this one was surprised by what I was eating and said a singer like me should avoid spicy foods...

But there's no way I could squeeze a song out if I have to live on bland, tasteless food all the time.

Besides, I realized that if I inhale hard after eating spicy food, I can make use of an underutilized vocal resonance area to add flavors to my singing. I've been working hard to master it!

So for my birthday, I'll eat all the spicy I want and use that super-husky voice to sing something really rock 'n' roll!

I need an audience to bear witness to this brand-new technique, so you better be there, or be square!
