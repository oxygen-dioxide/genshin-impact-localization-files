==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nevida:''' Hello. What can I do for you?
:{{DIcon}} Are you working?
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
::'''Nevida:''' Correct, the [[Bimarstan]] and neighboring areas are under my jurisdiction.
::'''Nevida:''' Don't be nervous, I primarily monitor the doctors and patients, so there is no "inadvertent" breach of confidentiality.
::'''Nevida:''' The [[Akademiya]] distributes information on a need-to-know basis through the [[Akasha Terminal]], so extra leaks could cause unwanted problems.
::'''Nevida:''' It would be great if you would work with our mandate and report anything unusual at once.
:{{DIcon}} Are you working at the moment?
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::'''Nevida:''' That's correct. The Bimarstan and areas near it are under my jurisdiction.
::'''Nevida:''' Do not fret, though. Now that Akasha has been shut down, I will no longer interfere in the exchange of knowledge between the doctors and their patients.
::'''Nevida:''' What I am focusing on at present is whether dialog between doctors and patients is going smoothly, and whether medical supplies are being effectively distributed or not.
::'''Nevida:''' Please cooperate with us Mahamata and make sure to report anything unusual to us at once.
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me.
::'''Nevida:''' It's all right.
