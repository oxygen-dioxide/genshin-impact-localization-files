==Description==
* Stabilization Mekaballs automatically avoid all the testers. Testers must make use of this characteristic to herd as many Stabilization Mekaballs as they can into {{Color|menu|their own target areas}} in as short a time as possible.
* In addition to the Stock Balls, {{Color|menu|Glitz Balls}} will also spawn. Herd Glitz Balls into the target area to obtain a higher score.
* {{Color|menu|Jump Boosters}} can be found in the testing ground. Pick one up to perform an {{Color|menu|extreme jump that goes higher and farther}}. It's perfect for rapidly moving to the other side of a Stabilization Mekaball, so use it well.
* The test will be carried out in one of five locations at random.

|[[File:Roses and Muskets Xtreme Drive Location 1.png|300px]]<br>Blubberbeast's Subliminal Visual Suggestion
|An empty, flat area suitable for testing the basic functions of the Stabilization Mekaballs.<br>Apparently, Helene's client chose to use Blubberbeasts as the inspiration for the outer covering of the "Stabilization Mekaballs" on the basis of a rather unusual theory: The curved body shape of Blubberbeasts is very smooth and round, and is completely non-threatening. Thus, even if a Stabilization Mekaball is moving at high speeds and suddenly switches directions, the actors will not be startled, but instead find it exceptionally amusing...
|-
|[[File:Roses and Muskets Xtreme Drive Location 2.png|300px]]<br>Underwater Tuning Suite
|An area featuring an interesting sculpture, well-suited to testing the Stabilization Mekaballs' dynamic visual perception.<br>The client once wanted to add audio playback devices to the Stabilization Mekaballs so that they could better meet various sound effect requirements for filming. Helene managed to think of a way to allow the Stabilization Mekaballs to make Blubberbeast sounds. However, before she could conduct large-scale testing, her hearing was severely damaged, so she could not imagine the racket a bunch of Stabilization Mekaballs together would make. Refusing to be misled by possibly fallacious tales, the client insisted on experiencing it for themselves, after which they had no choice but to reluctantly drop the requirement...
|-
|[[File:Roses and Muskets Xtreme Drive Location 3.png|300px]]<br>Dumb But Useful Pathfinding Technique
|An arena with circular barrier walls, suited to testing the Stabilization Mekaballs' anti-collision functions.<br>While being herded by the testing staff, the Stabilization Mekaballs will sometimes run into obstacles in a panic. This is when the Blubberbeast-shaped soft casing really shines, as it perfectly protects the delicate and intricate internal equipment. For this reason, even in complex environments with lots of navigational hazards, it can just stick to a wall to keep moving forward without any issues. "Since it's a Blubberbeast, the dumber it is, the cuter people will find it!"
|-
|[[File:Roses and Muskets Xtreme Drive Location 4.png|300px]]<br>Round and Round and Round It Goes
|An arena with short separating walls, suitable for testing the advanced steering functions of the Stabilization Mekaballs.<br>Thanks to the superb tech underlying the stabilization platforms, the Stabilization Mekaballs have excellent turning capabilities, handling just like what they were modeled on: a Blubberbeast balancing on a ball. Of course, it is not recommended that testing staff attempt to turn as quickly as the Stabilization Mekaballs and find out just how fast they can spin, because machines don't get dizzy!
|-
|[[File:Roses and Muskets Xtreme Drive Location 5.png|300px]]<br>Ninety-Nine Rotundly Round Portly Postures
|An arena with complex obstacles, suited for an all-around test of the Stabilization Mekaballs' functionalities.<br>In accordance with the client's expectations, after each requirement is met, one needs only adjust the relevant parameters to use the Stabilization Mekaballs in all kinds of film sets in order to automatically capture picturesque action scenes from up close or afar. But during testing, the scene is more like a Blubberbeast Ball, often dazzling onlookers...
