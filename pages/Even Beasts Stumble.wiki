==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You find someone in danger in the outskirts of Sumeru...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the person surrounded by monsters)
:'''Elber:''' Help! Somebody help me!
:'''Paimon:''' Someone's in danger! We've got to go help!

;(Rescue Elber)
:'''Elber:''' Whew. Thanks, Traveler...
:{{DIcon}} It's good to see they're alright.
:{{DIcon}} It was nothing.
:'''Elber:''' I'm Elber, a businessman. I was just relaxing here...
:'''Elber:''' I never expected to get attacked by those hilichurls...
:{{DIcon}} Didn't you have any guard with you?
:{{DIcon}} No one was protecting you?
:'''Paimon:''' We have heard in town that normally merchants would hire the Eremites to escort their goods.
:'''Elber:''' Well, that costs you Mora...
:'''Elber:''' The prices they asked for were just astronomical.
:'''Elber:''' I'm running a small business. Can't afford that kind of price...
:'''Elber:''' I thought, well, I know a thing or two about fighting monsters anyway, and it's not a long haul, so I might as well go on my own.
:'''Elber:''' But I didn't expect the hilichurls to spook my two Sumpter Beasts.
:'''Elber:''' I was run down by one before I could even react, and when I came to my feet, I got kicked by the other one.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh-oh...
:'''Elber:''' They soon ran away, and I was besieged by the hilichurls... Lucky for me, you were here to help.
:'''Elber:''' But all my stuff is on those two Sumpter Beasts... Traveler, could you please help bring them back for me?
:{{DIcon}} I don't want to get kicked...
:{{DIcon}} They could knock me over...
:'''Elber:''' Don't worry. They are gentle in nature, it's just those hilichurls knocked over their food.
:'''Elber:''' They had traveled so far with the loads and were very hungry. That's why they got so restive after their food was knocked over...
:'''Paimon:''' So they were disrupted when eating and their food was messed up...
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... Paimon is getting angry just thinking about that!
:{{DIcon}} You are quick to catch on to that, Paimon.
:'''Elber:''' Well, I'll just leave the food to you.
:'''Elber:''' Please feed the Sumpter Beasts when you find them.
:'''Elber:''' They won't throw tantrums as long as there's food.
:'''Elber:''' I noticed one of them knocked over the hilichurls and ran away...
:'''Elber:''' The other one seems to have been taken away by the hilichurls.
:'''Elber:''' I'll mark their locations roughly and leave the rest to you, Traveler.
:'''Elber:''' You'll be fairly paid for the return of my goods!

;(Talk to Elber again)
:'''Elber:''' *sigh* You simply can't disturb Sumpter Beasts while they're eating.
{{Dialogue end}}

===North Location===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the northern location)
:'''Paimon:''' This is one of the locations Mr. Elber marked for us.
:'''Paimon:''' See the footprints by the puddle? Did the Sumpter Beast leave that?
:'''Paimon:''' If it trod in the puddle, there would be water on the hooves.
:'''Paimon:''' Heh, it's time to use Elemental Sight! Follow the water's trail and we'll find the beast.

;(Approach the Sumpter Beast in the northern location)
:'''Paimon:''' What are the hilichurls doing around that Sumpter Beast?
:'''Paimon:''' They don't seem to want to make a meal out of it.
:'''Paimon:''' Ahem! Anyway, we've got to drive them away and take the Sumpter Beast back.

;(Approach the Sumpter Beast after defeating the hilichurls)
:'''Paimon:''' This one... looks a bit irritated...
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... Look at its hooves. So sturdy.
:'''Paimon:''' People could get stunned by a mere kick.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, you can feed it.
:'''Paimon:''' No! You go! Hurry!
:{{DIcon}} Please enjoy your food...
:{{DIcon}} No offense to your hooves...

:'''The Sumpter Beast slowly swallows the food. It seems less restive now...'''

:'''Paimon:''' It seems less angry now.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's bring it back. Careful, don't get kicked...

:'''You go back to Elber with the Sumpter Beast...'''

;(Continue to [[#First Sumpter Beast Returned|First Sumpter Beast Returned]] if this was the first Sumpter Beast found)
;(Continue to [[#Ending|Ending]] if this was the second Sumpter Beast found)
{{Dialogue end}}

===South Location===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the crates while heading towards the southern location)
:'''Paimon:''' The box has a lot of things inside, probably goods dropped by the fleeing Sumpter Beast.
:'''Paimon:''' It shouldn't be too far ahead. Let's move.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, remember to bring the cargo back to Mr. Elber.

;(Calm the Sumpter Beast)
:{{DIcon}} Calm Sumpter Beast
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! This Sumpter Beast is huge. It must hurt so bad getting kicked by it.
:'''Paimon:''' Feed it with the food Mr. Elber gave us.
:{{DIcon}} Nice and slow...
:{{DIcon}} Are these enough for it...?

:'''The Sumpter Beast gulps down the food. It seems to be in a better mood now...'''

:'''Paimon:''' It seems to be in a good mood.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's bring it back.

:'''You go back to Elber with the Sumpter Beast...'''

;(Continue to [[#First Sumpter Beast Returned|First Sumpter Beast Returned]] if this was the first Sumpter Beast found)
;(Continue to [[#Ending|Ending]] if this was the second Sumpter Beast found)
{{Dialogue end}}

===First Sumpter Beast Returned===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Elber:''' Whew... I thought I'd lost it.
:'''Elber:''' Thank you, Traveler. I can't express my gratitude enough.
:'''Elber:''' I must check its condition now. Hope it wasn't hurt...
:'''Elber:''' Traveler, please help me find the other Sumpter Beast.

;(Talk to Elber again)
:'''Elber:''' Besides this one, there was another Sumpter Beast that had wandered off.
:'''Elber:''' Luckily, this one's looking good.
:'''Elber:''' Traveler, please help me find the other one.

;(Find the Sumpter Beast in the other location)
{{Dialogue end}}

===Ending===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Elber:''' You got my two Sumpter Beasts back! Thank you so much, Traveler!
:'''Elber:''' I'll return to the city as soon as I get the goods in order.
:'''Elber:''' *sigh* I'll make sure to hire some escorts next time...
:{{DIcon}} About the goods...
:;(Submit 4 Harra Fruits and 3 Zaytun Peaches to Elber)
:'''Elber:''' Great! I can't thank you enough, Traveler!
:'''Elber:''' I could have gone broke if I'd lost the goods and these two Sumpter Beasts.
:{{DIcon}} Don't mention it.
:{{DIcon}} About our payment...
:'''Elber:''' Oh, yes, your payment... Please wait a second.
:'''Elber:''' Please take these. I can tell from your looks that you have been venturing around.
:'''Elber:''' I happen to be in the business of those gears. You could use all these.
:'''Elber:''' Whew... The Sumpter Beasts have been recovered and the goods are mostly intact. I should be off.
:'''Elber:''' Thanks again, Traveler.
:;(Quest ends)

;(Talk to Elber &mdash; if the player cancelled out of the submit item menu)
:'''Elber:''' Now both Sumpter Beasts are back... Thank you so much, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} About the goods...
:;(Same as above)
