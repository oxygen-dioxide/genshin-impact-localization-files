'''Froderock Fronkonsteen''' is a subordinate of [[Il Dottore]]'s who is in charge of the [[Fatui]] Desert Expedition Team to the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]].

He has not yet appeared in-game, but is mentioned by his subordinates and in various notes left behind in Fatui camps.

==Profile==
Little is currently known about Froderock, but his interest in the [[Eremite]]s led him to take charge of the expedition team to the Desert of Hadramaveth, where he has performed extensive research on the [[Tanit]] tribe.<ref>Interactable: [[Captain Zoya Snezhevna's Reports]]</ref> He is said to be unable to function without wine.<ref>Interactable: [[Warehouse Inventory Records]]</ref>

He is also involved with some kind of research which requires "live specimens," preferably ones in excellent health. [[Jeht]] was intended to be subjected to this research, but her capture was thwarted by the [[Traveler]].

Despite being Il Dottore's subordinate, a Fatui negotiator states that Froderock often defies the Harbinger's orders and ascribes it as jealousy.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rejoice With Me, for What Was Lost Is Now Found}}</ref> In a note presumably written by Froderock himself &mdash; appended to [[Ruslan Snezhevich]]'s Preliminary Test on Experimental Subject &mdash; he talks about gaining favor from their "great Harbinger," only to be rebuffed by another comment that seems to be from [[Zoya Snezhevna]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Make Bright the Arrows, Gather the Shields...}}</ref>

Froderock's current status is uncertain. A [[Fatui Skirmisher]] mentions him while fleeing an escaped Jeht: "Wait... Where is Professor Froderock? He hasn't escaped!?" This may indicate that Jeht killed him, but it's also possible that he escaped unseen or remained hidden in the ruin where the Traveler found Jeht.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*Froderock Fronkensteen's name is an allusion to Frederick Frankenstein from ''{{w|Young Frankenstein}}''. Frederick is the grandson of {{w|Victor Frankenstein}}, but dislikes the "mad scientist" connotation that his surname carries and attempts to distance himself from it by insisting that his surname is pronounced "Fronkensteen."
