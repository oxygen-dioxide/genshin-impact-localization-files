'''Sandrone''', also known by her codename "'''Marionette''',"<ref name="lazzo video description" /> is the Seventh of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].

She makes her first appearance during ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'' alongside her fellow Harbingers.

==Profile==
Sandrone was first mentioned in the description of [[Tartaglia]]'s Character Tales, [https://youtu.be/ZF4KyX0ASnI "Childe: Sigil of Permission"], which mentions that she once admonished [[Javert]] for an unknown reason.

Tartaglia himself describes her as always engaged in a research on [[Automatons]]; the modified one that always follows her, and that towers her in height, seems to be a product of this research. She also loathes him for reasons unknown, causing him to wonder if he had annoyed her in some way.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About Marionette}}</ref> On the other hand, [[Scaramouche]] claims that all she makes is garbage and that she had always had a bad attitude.

==Trivia==
* Sandrone is accompanied by what appears to be a modified version of a [[Ruin Machine]], indicated by the symbols all over its body.
** According to [[Wanderer]]'s [[Wanderer/Lore|Character Stories]], puppet-making techniques had their roots in [[Khaenri'ah]].

===Etymology===
* In ''{{w|commedia dell'arte}}'', from which the Eleven Fatui Harbingers' aliases and titles are derived, {{w|Sandrone}}, his wife, and his son were originally represented by puppets.
