'''Sandrone''', also known by her codename "'''Marionette''',"<ref name="lazzo video description 7" /> is one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].

She makes her first appearance during ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'' alongside her fellow Harbingers.

==Profile==
Sandrone was first mentioned in the description of [[Tartaglia]]'s Character Tale, [[:File:Character Tales - "Childe- Sigil of Permission" - Genshin Impact|"Childe: Sigil of Permission"]], which mentions that she once admonished [[Javert]] for an unknown reason.

Tartaglia himself describes her as always engaged in a research on [[Automatons]]; the modified one that always follows her, and that towers her in height, seems to be a product of this research. She also loathes him for reasons unknown, causing him to wonder if he had annoyed her in some way.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About Marionette}}</ref>
