==Profile==
Phonia is a member of the [[Knights of Favonius]]. Originally, she was a Signals Officer of the intelligence division of the [[Knights_of_Favonius#Investigation|Investigation Team]], led by [[Albedo]]. Before the events of ''Mutual Security Enhancing Simulation'', the [[Knights_of_Favonius#The_7th_Company,_Combined_Arms|7th Company]] was reformed and Phonia was transferred there as its Intelligence Officer. Her younger sister, [[Ematol]], was also transferred there as the Weapons Officer at Phonia's behest, resulting in the sisters often appearing together.

Phonia is currently providing Ematol with housing, albeit at a price (which, based on their bickering in ''Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure'', Ematol is failing to pay).<ref>Event ''[[Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure]]'' Optional Dialogue: [[Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure/Story#Suspicious Wooden Chest|Suspicious Wooden Chest]]</ref> Their ongoing living situation is occasionally brought up in their dialogue during subsequent events.

===Appearance===
Phonia wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeved shirt, tight-fitting pants under a gray skirt and a white plate armor worn on top. Unlike other knights, she does not have her knees covered and only has greaves on her legs. The Knights of Favonius crest decorates her breastplate.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Phonia:''' We meet again, Honorary Knight. When [[Su Ding]] mentioned he planned on inviting a reliable outside expert to join us, I immediately thought of you.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I don't remember you very well...
::'''Phonia:''' That's fine, after all, I'm just a cog in the machine. Officers don't necessarily have to remember the name of everyone serving under them, just their positions and duties. That's enough to be able to effectively give orders.
::'''Phonia:''' I'm Phonia, formerly a Signals Officer of the Investigative Team. I'm responsible for testing alchemical instruments developed by Captain Albedo and exploring the uses of remote reconnaissance technology.
::'''Phonia:''' However, in light of how the Knights of Favonius have updated their tactics and the staffing structure now that some units from the expeditionary force have returned, Captain Albedo applied to have me assigned to the reorganized 7th Company.
::'''Phonia:''' The 7th Company is temporarily designated as a "Combined Arms Company," which integrates knights with a range of capabilities into a single combat unit, with a balance of ranged and melee firepower. Such a unit is also very reliant on reconnaissance.
::'''Phonia:''' When the time comes, the expeditionary force's No. 2 &mdash; the venerable Commander [[Frederica Gunnhildr]] might become our Company's Captain.
::'''Phonia:''' After all, Commander Frederica has served for longer than many Knights have been alive, and her experience in battle is unmatched. It wouldn't be too much to say she is perfectly suited for leadership.
::{{DIcon}} Gunnhildr? That sounds familiar...
::{{DIcon}} Isn't that also Jean's last name...?
::'''Phonia:''' Correct! Commander Frederica is the Acting Grand Master's mother, and is famous throughout Mondstadt.
::'''Phonia:''' She's been on active duty on the front lines for decades on end, never tiring or slowing. When the youths of Mondstadt talk of their dreams of being a hero, the name "Frederica" is never far from their lips.
::'''Phonia:''' And I was one of them! When I joined the Knights of Favonius, it was because of my admiration for Commander Frederica...
::'''Phonia:''' Of course, I later realized that I was only talented enough to be just one more cog in the machine. As for the heroic protagonists of the storybooks that can take on a hundred foes all alone... that's another story.
::{{DIcon}} Jean's mother...
::{{DIcon}} Might become a Captain?
::'''Phonia:''' That's only my speculation as a Signals Officer. As I see it, the 7th Company will likely be one of the most formidable units, and so Commander Frederica would be the most suitable candidate for Captain.
::'''Phonia:''' Though Commander Frederica's position in the Knights of Favonius long surpassed any ordinary Captain, she doesn't seem to like pushing paperwork around and insists on staying on the front lines, toe-to-toe with foes.
::'''Phonia:''' In principle, the Knights of Favonius value ability and experience equally, so after she returns, perhaps we'll see the Acting Grand Master giving orders to Commander Frederica...
::'''Phonia:''' The two of them should have absolutely seamless synergy.
:{{DIcon}} I feel like I've seen you before...
::'''Phonia:''' That's right! We've met once before, while I was executing the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation.
::'''Phonia:''' Since then, I've been carrying out experiments to advance alchemical detection equipment as planned, and have worked with the Reconnaissance Company and Outriders on numerous occasions.
::'''Phonia:''' Over time, I slowly became a slightly more important cog in the Knights of Favonius's intelligence machine, and that's why I was chosen to participate in this event.
::'''Phonia:''' Who knows, maybe the next time you return to the Knights to take on a commission, the intel I gather will be useful to you!
:{{DIcon}} How do you think the Wargame is going?
::'''Phonia:''' The thing that strikes me most is how each nation has a vastly different approach to fighting.
::'''Phonia:''' Due to the different levels of focus on the size of their forces and training, the [[Millelith]] are concerned more with formations and the disposition of their troops.
::'''Phonia:''' When clearing out hordes of monsters, they're like a steel-flanked juggernaut. They can just directly roll over an entire camp of the beasties, crushing everything in their path. Offense and defense all in one, completely unstoppable.
::'''Phonia:''' When operating on terrain ill-suited to deploying a wide front line, they'll split up, reassembling into multiple smaller formations of the appropriate dimensions such that their flexibility to pursue their objectives isn't compromised.
::'''Phonia:''' Even if an opponent studies their tactics and formations, and their intelligence is accurate, it would still be difficult to find a weakness to exploit.
::'''Phonia:''' Fortunately, this style requires a very high degree of awareness and discipline from every soldier. In all of [[Teyvat]], maybe only [[Liyue]]'s Millelith can do that...
:{{DIcon}} I won't keep you any longer.
::'''Phonia:''' Then we'll talk more next time, Honorary Knight.
{{Dialogue End}}

====Set #2====
''Available after acquiring the quest ''[[Scenarios for Study]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Phonia:''' Looks like you're pretty much done, Honorary Knight. Our work here is almost finished too, so we'll be heading back to Mondstadt soon.
:{{DIcon}} How did the collaboration go?
::'''Phonia:''' Not bad at all. It's exposed a flaw in our current strategy &mdash; namely, that the long-range capabilities of our mobile forces seem to be somewhat lacking.
::'''Phonia:''' During the Wargames, we had multiple skirmishes with the clockwork meka of Fontaine. Though we did have units with heavy bows, they had great difficulty penetrating the thick armor of our opponents, so we had to get in close as much as possible.
::'''Phonia:''' But as a result, we lost the intel advantage that we'd expected our alchemical recon equipment to give us.
::'''Phonia:''' Seems like we're going to need the [[Amber|Outrider]]'s input on this one.
::'''Phonia:''' Or... Perhaps [[Ematol]] could make us some miniature explosives, which we could... attach to our arrowheads?
::'''Phonia:''' Yes... That sounds like it might just work.
:{{DIcon}} Safe trip back!
::'''Phonia:''' See you in Mondstadt, Honorary Knight.

===Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Phonia:''' Greetings Honorary Knight and the Helper in White. I'm not technically on duty right now, but I can't go home yet, thanks to this extracurricular project that Ematol has given me.
:{{DIcon}} Extracurricular Project?
::'''Phonia:''' Basically, she's worried her record of your experience playing "Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades" might not suffice, so she wanted me to take some extra recordings.
::'''Paimon:''' Wow, you two really are close, aren't you?
::'''Phonia:''' The way I see it, this is just a way of banking some credit so Ematol might actually feel guilty the next time she plays a prank on me.
::'''Paimon:''' Uhh, Paimon's not sure she actually will, but at least it adds another layer to your relationship!
:{{DIcon}} Come on Phonia, lighten up!
::'''Phonia:''' Oh, you think I'm taking it too seriously? People often say that my responses are a bit too by-the-book. Boring, even...
::'''Phonia:''' But I'm just trying to cut down on unnecessary communication so I can get some peace and quiet.
::'''Paimon:''' Umm... {{Traveler}}, we should probably go now...
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, keep up the good work!
::'''Phonia:''' Thank you, and have fun. Once we're done with all the recording, it'll finally be time for this cog in the machine to get some rest...

:'''Phonia:''' Let the wind lead, Honorary Knight. As you can see, the Knights are currently piloting Wargaming simulations. If you can spare the time, we hope you can assist us in completing the testing.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Phonia:''' I'm Phonia, intelligence officer of the reorganized 7th Company, and also one of the people who proposed this Wargame.
::'''Phonia:''' Currently, my main tasks are the development and maintenance of alchemical recon equipment, collecting intel, and analyzing enemies. If you need help, just contact my acting superior.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like reporting work...
:::'''Phonia:''' Well, we all work for the Knights of Favonius, and we're all on the clock right now, so rather than indulging ourselves in exchanges of meaningless information, our time would be best used discussing useful intel..
:::'''Phonia:''' I am but an ordinary cog in the machine that is the Knights of Favonius. Aside from my duties, any information about me is of significance to you.
:::{{DIcon}} Well, "cog" is a rather peculiar way to describe yourself.
::::'''Phonia:''' It is only the truth. I'm just an ordinary person without any particular talent or ambition. I'm just here to do what I can.
::::'''Phonia:''' And that's fine by me. I worry about nothing outside of my duties, and I live an ordinary life. A good way to avoid troubles, really.
:::{{DIcon}} Err, could you tell me a bit about yourself anyway?
::::'''Phonia:''' I've told you all that's worth hearing. Or would you like to hear something more personal? Let me think...
::::'''Phonia:''' I'm Phonia, 26 years old, single. I currently live in the third room on the third floor of the third building to the right of the city gates. I have a roommate called Ematol, who also happens to be my tenant, and the monthly rent is... I forget, it's not important.
::::'''Phonia:''' My hobby is sleeping. After work, I just go home and sleep. If it's too noisy, I'll have some wine to help me sleep. I don't remember what kind of wine I used to drink, but that's not important either. As long as it can get me drunk, it's good wine.
::::'''Phonia:''' As for where I was born, how I spent my childhood, what my parents did before I was born, and all that, I suspect such things are far less significant.
::::'''Phonia:''' If you don't need any more information from me, please allow me to continue my analysis work. Of course, if you do have any questions about the Wargame, please feel free to consult me at any time.
::{{DIcon}} Your acting superior?
:::'''Phonia:''' Yes. 7th Company was only reorganized recently, so we haven't yet settled on our captaincy.
:::'''Phonia:''' The 7th Company is temporarily designated as a "Combined Arms Company," which integrates knights with a range of capabilities into a single combat unit, with a balance of ranged and melee firepower. Such a unit is also very reliant on reconnaissance.
:::'''Phonia:''' In time, the expeditionary force's No. 2 &mdash; the venerable Commander Frederica Gunnhildr &mdash; might become our Company's Captain.
:::'''Phonia:''' After all, Commander Frederica has served for longer than many Knights have been alive, and her experience in battle is unmatched. It wouldn't be too much to say she is perfectly suited for leadership.
:::{{DIcon}} Wait. That Gunnhildr?
:::{{DIcon}} Isn't that also Jean's last name...?
::::'''Phonia:''' Correct! Commander Frederica is the Acting Grand Master's mother, and is renowned throughout Mondstadt.
::::'''Phonia:''' She's been on active duty on the front lines for decades now, never tiring or slowing. When the youths of Mondstadt talk of their dreams of being a hero, the name "Frederica" is never far from their lips.

::::'''Phonia:''' Of course, I later realized that I was only talented enough to be just one more cog in the machine. As for the heroic protagonists of the storybooks that can take on a hundred foes all alone... that's another story.
::::{{DIcon}} So Jean's mother... will be your captain?
:::::'''Phonia:''' That's only my speculation as an intelligence officer. As I see it, the 7th Company will likely be one of the most formidable units, and so Commander Frederica would be the most suitable candidate for Captain.
:::::'''Phonia:''' Though Commander Frederica's position in the Knights of Favonius has long surpassed any ordinary Captain, she's never been one for pushing pencils. She's always insisted on staying on the front lines, toe-to-toe with foes.
:::::'''Phonia:''' In principle, the Knights of Favonius value ability and experience equally, so after she returns, perhaps we'll see the Acting Grand Master giving orders to Commander Frederica...
:{{DIcon}} Wargame?
::'''Phonia:''' Yes. As I'm sure you've seen, the scourge of monsters wandering the wilds remains one of the issues that all nations in Teyvat must deal with.
::'''Phonia:''' In short, I've drawn inspiration from the Millelith General Staff's previous methods, collating all manner of reports in order to construct this Wargame.
::'''Phonia:''' By simulating battles between monsters, we can learn the best strategies to defeat them while in a non-combat environment. If you're interested, please give it a try yourself.
::{{DIcon}} It looks like... a game of chess?
:::'''Phonia:''' You're certainly right about that. There are indeed similarities between the conduct of Wargames and chess, so the comparison is quite apt.
:::'''Phonia:''' "Playing chess" is enough to help conduct valuable tactical analysis, and that's also where the charm of Wargames lie. You can just think of it as a regular "chess game."
:::'''Phonia:''' In any case, I've applied for permission from the Acting Grand Master. Everyone is free to take part in these simulations, and all participants will be entitled to a thank-you gift.
:::'''Phonia:''' So if you have the time, Honorary Knight, I hope that you, too, will take part in our simulations. After all, I doubt that there are many in Mondstadt who know more about monsters than you do.
:::{{DIcon}} I see. I'll give it a go when I have time, then.
::::'''Phonia:''' My thanks. We've already prepared the board, so we can begin at any time. I look forward to witnessing a commanding performance from you, Honorary Knight.
:::{{DIcon}} Everyone can participate?
::::'''Phonia:''' The battlefield brims with uncertainty. No matter how thorough the investigation, the fog of war, which no wind can disperse, will still shroud about three-quarters of it.
::::'''Phonia:''' As such, the more participants we get, the more likely we can simulate even the most unpredictable of monster behavior patterns.
::::'''Phonia:''' All strategy and theory can only be based on real tactical results. No matter what the battle situation, only the success of our strategies can determine victory or defeat.
::::'''Phonia:''' Such simulations help to expose our weaknesses, such that we Knights can improve them in real future combat scenarios.
::::{{DIcon}} Nice! Clear as mud, though!
:::::'''Phonia:''' It's alright. Analyzing the simulation results is an intelligence officer's duty, Honorary Knight. You, as the commander, do not have to fret over these details. Just focus on doing battle.
::::{{DIcon}} Got it. So I'll play the chess, and you'll do the rest?
:::::'''Phonia:''' Precisely. Analyzing the simulation results is an intelligence officer's duty, Honorary Knight. You, as the commander, do not have to fret over these details &mdash; simply command.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
::'''Phonia:''' Alright. You stay safe as well.

:'''Phonia:''' An honor to see you again, Honorary Knight. As you can see, the Knights are currently piloting Wargaming simulations. If you can spare the time, we hope you can assist us in completing the testing.
:{{DIcon}} I remember you...
::'''Phonia:''' Phonia's the name. Former Investigative Team Signals Officer, responsible for testing alchemical recon instruments developed by Captain Albedo. Presently, I'm the 7th Company's Intelligence Officer, and also the one who proposed this Wargame.
::{{DIcon}} Ah, I remember now! You were the one by Cider Lake...
:::'''Phonia:''' Yes. My thanks for your assistance in the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation, as well as your participation in Su Ding's Wargame of Five Armies, Honorary Knight.
:::'''Phonia:''' Still, I'm just an ordinary "cog" in the Knights of Favonius "machine," so I'm honored that you remember me at all.
::{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, but I really don't remember you...
:::'''Phonia:''' It's alright. I'm just an ordinary "cog" in the Knights of Favonius "machine." There's no need to spend too much time remembering my name.
:::'''Phonia:''' In any case, you have my thanks for your assistance in the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation, as well as your participation in Su Ding's Wargame of Five Armies, Honorary Knight.
:{{DIcon}} So, about this Wargame...
::'''Phonia:''' Following that last joint Wargame, I referenced the methods of the Millelith General Staff to make monster chess pieces, which will be used to simulate fights between them. This will assist us in discovering the best ways of dealing with said monsters.
::'''Phonia:''' It's just that I've expanded the variety of pieces based on intel received from our expedition force, such that we can simulate different combat environments.
::'''Phonia:''' If we get the chance to work together again, the Knights of Favonius will share this intel with our neighboring nations, in the interest of enhancing our common security.
::{{DIcon}} I see some rare creatures indeed...
:::'''Phonia:''' And that is thanks to the expedition force. I doubt my imagination would have sufficed without the intel they brought back.
:::'''Phonia:''' Gathering intel has always been one of the most important components of our tactics, and it is also one of the most effective ways to avoid unnecessary casualties.
:::'''Phonia:''' It was five hundred years ago that [[Arundolyn|Grand Master Arundolyn]] said thusly...
:::'''Phonia:''' Ah, sorry. I got off-topic. In any case, these game pieces were created based on the intel we gathered, and they should be enough to simulate the monsters' true abilities.
::{{DIcon}} I didn't expect you to be interested in Wargames...
:::'''Phonia:''' ...Ahem. I fear I must correct you, Honorary Knight. This is not merely a "Wargame," but tactical training, which I must &mdash; with the utmost enthusiasm &mdash; recommend to my fellow Knights.
:::'''Phonia:''' This... This is a serious measure taken to achieve a serious goal, not a mere "interest." A "cog" like myself does not have any "interests"...
::'''Phonia:''' In any case, I've applied for permission from the Acting Grand Master. Everyone is free to take part in these simulations, and all participants will be entitled to a thank-you gift.
::'''Phonia:''' So if you have the time, Honorary Knight, I personally hope that you, too, will take part in our simulations. After all, I doubt that there are many in Mondstadt who know more about monsters than you do.
::{{DIcon}} I see. I'll give it a go when I have time, then.
:::'''Phonia:''' My thanks. We've already prepared the board, so we can begin at any time. Just as before, I look forward to learning from your commanding performance, Honorary Knight.
::{{DIcon}} You say that everyone can participate... Could you elaborate a bit?
:::'''Phonia:''' The battlefield brims with uncertainty. No matter how thorough the investigation, the fog of war, which no wind can disperse, will still shroud about three-quarters of it.
:::'''Phonia:''' As such, the more participants we get, the more likely we can simulate even the most unpredictable of monster behavior patterns.
:::'''Phonia:''' All strategy and theory can only be based on real tactical results. No matter what the battle situation, only the success of our strategies can determine victory or defeat.
:::'''Phonia:''' Such simulations help to expose our weaknesses, such that we Knights can improve them in real future combat scenarios.
:::{{DIcon}} I don't get it... But I just need to play, right?
::::'''Phonia:''' Precisely. Analyzing the simulation results is an intelligence officer's duty, Honorary Knight. You, as the commander, do not have to fret over these details &mdash; simply command.
::::'''Phonia:''' During the previous joint Wargame, [[Turenna]] of Fontaine's [[Special Security and Surveillance Patrol]] mentioned a saying &mdash; "Fontaine expects that everyone will do their duty"...
::::'''Phonia:''' It seems to have been a famous quote from a naval commander of theirs from long ago &mdash; a most outstanding figure indeed. I am in full agreement with this view, and it applies to us Knights too, in a sense.
::::'''Phonia:''' From commander to soldier, so long as every "cog" in the "machine" fulfills its duty, operating in perfect accordance with orders given, we should be sufficient to ensure Mondstadt's security.
::::'''Phonia:''' *sigh* If only Ematol could understand this simple principle, she wouldn't give me a headache from making noise all day long...
::::'''Phonia:''' Well, at any rate, we've already prepared the board, so we can begin at any time. Just as before, I look forward to learning some techniques from you, Honorary Knight.
:::{{DIcon}} Speaking of which, you did mention a weakness previously...
::::'''Phonia:''' That's right &mdash; you have an excellent memory, Honorary Knight. Our previous joint Wargame exposed our lack of strong ranged combat capabilities.
::::'''Phonia:''' It is difficult for our projectiles to hit highly-armored targets at a distance, but if they get close, we lose the positional advantages granted by our alchemical recon equipment.
::::'''Phonia:''' To solve this, I have asked the Acting Grand Master to put Ematol into the 7th Company to develop miniature explosive arrowheads or similar substitutes.
::::'''Phonia:''' Frankly speaking, I don't have any clue how far she's gotten, but as long as she doesn't blow my house up, I couldn't care less if she blew herself sky-high. Wouldn't be the first time she's done that.
::::'''Phonia:''' In terms of results, at least she's not over at Cider Lake tinkering with her bombs day-in and day-out, so that's a mental health positive for me... Even though she's still terribly noisy.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
::'''Phonia:''' Don't worry, you weren't disturbing me either way. If there is anything I can help with, or if there's any intel you need me to gather, you need only ask, Honorary Knight.
