|description    = A wood carving that was once displayed outside [[Acara Crafts]] in [[Port Ormos]]. This was the prototype of their [[Aranara]] toy series, painstakingly crafted by artisans [[Fayez]] and [[Mamdouh]], both of whom had never seen a real Aranara before but believed that these mythical creatures could bring joy and laughter to children. The Prototype Aranara was initially not very well-received, but thanks to storyteller [[Tanger]]'s son [[Razi]], the [[Traveler]], and [[Paimon]], the Acara Crafts staff successfully created Aranara carvings beloved by the children. This prototype was given to the Traveler and Paimon as a gift to express the artisans' gratitude.
