{{Description|Legend has it that while some [[adepti]] were pursuing the adeptal path, they would wander across mountains and rivers, enjoying various gourmet dishes, using such means to quiet their hearts.<br>Their path would be called the "Trail of Delicacies" by those who came after. Now, the [[Adventurers' Guild]] has combined this fascinating challenge with the traditions of the [[Moonchase Festival]], placing many treasure chests along the Trail of Delicacies.<br>Follow three such Trails, defeat any foes that lurk around them, and the handsome rewards shall be yours!}}
