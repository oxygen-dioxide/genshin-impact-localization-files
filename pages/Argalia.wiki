{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Argalia:''' Should I redo my storage plan for the tableware again...?
:{{DIcon}} What about the tableware?
::'''Argalia:''' Well, I'm currently considering how to arrange the various utensils we use here at the hotel.
::'''Argalia:''' I used to place them in a rack close to the outside, which would make them easy to take and use.
::'''Argalia:''' But Lynette once knocked them over when she was invited to perform here, causing them to clatter to the ground, shattering on impact.
::'''Argalia:''' Fortunately, Lynette wasn't hurt &mdash; everyone would surely have been grieved if her beautiful face was injured by mistake...
::{{DIcon}} I happen to agree with you.
::'''Argalia:''' I know, right?
::'''Argalia:''' Back then, Lynette didn't blame us for not taking care of the tableware better. She even apologized, saying that this sort of thing always happens to her...
::'''Argalia:''' Maybe she only said that so we wouldn't feel too awkward about things. I mean, she seems rather cold, but she's actually super modest and polite!
:{{DIcon}} Eh? There's another one of you...
::'''Argalia:''' Ah, you must've met [[Leone|my elder sister]] downstairs, huh?
::'''Argalia:''' We're twins, and most people can't tell us apart by appearance. We sound very different, though, so we get exposed the moment we open our mouths.
::'''Argalia:''' My sister speaks slow, but she's a careful sort. If you need help on the first floor of the restaurant, just leave it to her.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Argalia:''' Come back any time!
