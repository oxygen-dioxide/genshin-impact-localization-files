|text    = I've been up to my neck in work lately, and before I knew it, it was my birthday again. It was only then that I also realized that it's been a long time since we last met up. How have things been lately? You're always so busy with your travels, never stopping, not even for a moment.

I suppose we're alike like that &mdash; always seizing the day. It's good to live to the fullest. Time waits for no one, but the fruits of our labor, the growth we experience... These are worthy harvests that will see us through in the days ahead.

But of course, rest is also paramount. I have enclosed some flowers and plants that I usually make tea with. They dispel heatiness and help to relieve fatigue. Take care of yourself out there. We'll catch up when you're back in [[Liyue]].
