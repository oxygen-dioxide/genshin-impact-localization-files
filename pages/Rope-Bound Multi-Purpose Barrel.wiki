|description    = A plain and unadorned wooden barrel, bound with common rope instead of traditional iron hoops, reducing costs and simplifying production, thus making it highly affordable. Its only distinctive feature is the round handle affixed to the barrel's side, allowing it to be lifted or hung from a hook when necessary. However, it is important to note that this method of suspension is only suitable when the barrel contains solids or powders, as liquids may cause it to leak.
