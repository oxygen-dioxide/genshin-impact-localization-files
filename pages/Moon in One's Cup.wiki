==Trivia==
* <section begin=MoonCup />The soundtracks ''Moon in One's Cup'', ''Maiden's Longing'', and ''Clear Sky Over Liyue'' were based on one of the previous works of composer Yu-Peng Chen. His single ''[https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1315882006 {{Lang|zh=一杯月|zh_tl=A Cup of Moon|mini=1}}]'' was released in 2018 and had a similar name to the first soundtrack mentioned above. The shared melody between them was also used as the representative theme of Liyue in ''[https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]''.<section end=MoonCup />
