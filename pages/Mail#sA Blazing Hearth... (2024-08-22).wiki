|text      = The children relish creating opportunities to bond with each other — having barbecue dinners, enjoying cool breezes, going stargazing together... Instead of racking their brains for a reason, "Father's" birthday is but the perfect occasion. Arranging the venue, preparing the food... In this process, the children tend to incorporate their personal preferences every now and then.

I do not mind, as it is a "Father's" duty to provide opportunities for relaxation at the right time.

Regrettably, some familiar faces will no longer appear, and for their own varied reasons, which need neither concealment nor sugarcoating. The children must all learn not to let sorrow cloud their heart and mind, be it sooner or later. 

Your connection with the [[House of the Hearth]], however, is an unexpected delight. Many here are looking forward to seeing you at today's gathering. If it is convenient for you, please do not let their expectations go unmet.

The hearth at the House is blazing, and the children will be at the door to welcome you.
