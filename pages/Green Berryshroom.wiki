|description  = An ordinary-looking mushroom with an extraordinary flavor. Only grows near [[Varesa's Orchard|the orchard]] at [[Varesa]]'s house. They're fast growers, so if you see one, eat it quickly.<br><br>'''After completing [[Mushroom Realm Mystery]]:'''<br>Investigations have revealed these mushrooms to be alter egos of the [[Bifrons|mushroom god]], and, if allowed to grow unchecked, the mushroom god would regain its power. However, as long as people continue to eat them, they will continue to just be very tasty mushrooms.
