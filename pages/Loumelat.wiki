{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Loumelat:''' So fishing is my Rashid.
:{{DIcon|Fishing Supplies}} I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
::'''Loumelat:''' Take your pick! They are all affordable. And rest assured my friend, I have other ways to make a fortune, hehe.
:;(Opens the [[Sumeru Fishing Association]] shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you, again?
::'''Loumelat:''' I'm Loumelat bint Atif Abu Rashid, a fisher here in Sumeru.
::'''Loumelat:''' I might be good at fishing, but I was actually born in the desert. There are oases out there, sure, but we hardly ever see any fish. I didn't even know what a fish was when I was a kid.
::'''Loumelat:''' It was not until I came to the harbor that I realized I was so good at fishing. I could earn in one year what other people make in three!
::'''Loumelat:''' I doubt it'll be long now before I can bring my parents here to live with me. Haha, this is my Rashid!
:{{DIcon}} What is a "Rashid"?
::'''Loumelat:''' It means "the right path or calling." That's "Rashid"! it's an expression they use back in my hometown, and also a part of my name.
::'''Loumelat:''' I believe everything has its Rashid. I'm drawn to fishing, and the fish are drawn to me.
::'''Loumelat:''' Hehe, have you found your own Rashid?
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Loumelat:''' See you. May you find your Rashid soon.
