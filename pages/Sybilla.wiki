'''Sybilla''', also known as the '''Golden Bee''' and '''the prophet''', is a historical character from [[Fontaine]], most closely associated with [[Remus]] and the nation of [[Remuria]].

Originally an envoy tasked with guarding the [[Irminsul]] tree in an ancient city located in what later became the High Seas, Sybilla's form and mind were worn down until she remained in the form of a golden bee. Remus discovered her in this state after accidentally entering the city's ruins, and she departed with him to establish Remuria.<ref name="Harmonious">{{Ref/Arti|Harmonious Symphony Prelude}}</ref>

Sybilla is implied to have been an [[Angel]].

==Profile==
As a former envoy, Sybilla had prophetic powers which allowed her to foretell Remus and Remuria's future. Though she played a major role in building Remuria's prosperity and later sacrificed her life for the sake of creating [[Phobos]], Remus' Grand Symphony,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Last Day of Remuria}}</ref> her lack of a will ultimately caused the project to fail, as her vague desire to "grant happiness to all in the world who are called humans" caused Phobos to attempt to satisfy "everyone's" desires &mdash; including destructive and selfish ones &mdash; and set Remuria towards the course of its self-destruction.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fortune Plango Vulnera}}</ref>

==Story==
Sybilla was an envoy who survived the "last deluge that swallowed the earth,"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fortune Plango Vulnera}}</ref> remaining inside an ancient city and continuing to protect its silver-white tree. This lasted for an unknown duration of time until Remus accidentally discovered the city's ruins.<ref name="Harmonious" />
