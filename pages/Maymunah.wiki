Like other blue-haired characters in the Mirage (besides Idiya), the blue-haired Maymunah that Traveler meets is a [[Hydro Eidolon]] replica of a human from Teyvat that once visited Mirage and then left it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the Bottle}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Like other characters in the Mirage, Maymunah has watery-blue hair and glowing blue eyes. She wears the Akademiya robes and her hat has a symbol of the [[Spantamad]] Darshan.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Maymunah:''' It's great that we're busy again, but management work is really a giant pain in the... huh? So you made time to visit the Fairgrounds today?
:{{DIcon}} Maymunah seems troubled...
::'''Maymunah:''' Yes, it is spacious here, but the number of stalls is limited. After the light in the large tent got fixed, even more people are interested in applying for a stall...
::'''Maymunah:''' Nothing is harder than making decisions and arrangements!
::'''Maymunah:''' My predecessor must have abandoned me here and fled back to Sumeru because they just couldn't take it anymore...
::'''Maymunah:''' Still, anything is hard when you're first starting. If I just take time to think and train my brain... I'm taking care of these Fairgrounds in her stead to prove...
::'''Maymunah:''' To prove that things would have been better, if only she had spent more time.
::{{DIcon}} She?
::'''Maymunah:''' Oh, I'm just rambling! Ignore my nonsense, haha.
::'''Maymunah:''' Though now that I think about it... It's only thanks to your fixing the Crystal Light that I even have the opportunity for such worries...
::{{DIcon}} Oh? So I did more harm than help?
::{{DIcon}} You're really blaming me?
::'''Maymunah:''' Hehe, just joking, just joking! Thanks for fixing the Crystal Light, I mean it.
::'''Maymunah:''' Hehe... As part of your reward, shouldn't you see the fruits of your labor? Now that it's lively again, you should come visit more!
:{{DIcon}} I'm just looking around.
::'''Maymunah:''' Hehe... Have a nice time.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* Under the effects of [[Elemental Sight]], she is indicated to be affected by Hydro, similarly to [[Idyia]] and other NPCs in the Mirage.
