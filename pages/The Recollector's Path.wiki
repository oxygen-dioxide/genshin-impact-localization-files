{{Description|Though a dazzling title is appealing, a noble character of stalwart virtue is indispensable when faced with the totality of challenges. Therefore, trials must be undertaken to fully understand [[Sorush]]'s responsibilities...}}
'''The Recollector's Path: Trials of the Bloomguard''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 3.6]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2023/05/08 10:00 - 2023/05/22 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above
* Complete the World Quest "[[The Splendorous Sky That Day]]"
* Obtain the "[[Twin-Horned Chaplet]]" in the World Quest "[[As the Khvarena's Light Shows]]" first to get the best experience from this event.
** During the event, if the player has not obtained the "Twin-Horned Chaplet" in the World Quest "As the Khvarena's Light Shows," they can enter the event through "[[Quick Start]]" in the event page.

===Summary===
* During the event, help [[Sorush]] complete various forms of trials to obtain [[Primogem]]s, [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], and other rewards.
* On the first 6 days of the "The Recollector's Path" event, a corresponding quest will be unlocked alongside two trials daily, and all prior quests and trials must be completed before the content of the following day can be accepted.
* Trials need to be completed by Sorush alone and they come in three varieties:
** Tranquil Trail: Use the power of Nirodha Fruits to activate Curios and repel the uninvited guests invading the Vourukasha Oasis.
** Intrepid Impulse: Sorush must reach her destination within the time limit.
** Reinforced Reminiscence: Discover sites of important memories and restore a scene of significance.

===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path.png
|text1  = In the "The Recollector's Path" event, you must help Sorush follow Zurvan's instructions to discover her role as a Bloomguard.
|image2 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path.png
|text2  = When each stage of The Recollector's Path begins, Sorush must listen to Zurvan's teachings, and then go to the specified site to undergo two trials, before engaging in a short summary after passing said trials.
}}

;Tranquil Trail
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Tranquil Trail 1.png
|text1  = During the Tranquil Trail trial, Sorush will need to use the Nirodha Fruit and the Curios scattered nearby to pursue your uninvited guests...
|image2 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Tranquil Trail 2.png
|text2  = During the trial, Sorush can throw out an unlimited number of Nirodha Fruits. As these fruits hit different Curios, various effects will be triggered that will affect the nearby uninvited guests.
|image3 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Tranquil Trail 3.png
|text3  = When the situation gets too cluttered, you can use Analysis to summarize the specialties of the various Curios and uninvited guests, and thus figure out a way to drive them out...
}}

;Reinforced Reminiscence
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Reinforced Reminiscence 1.png
|text1  = During the Reinforced Reminiscence trial, Sorush can use Memory Fragments to check important Reminiscences. You must assist Sorush in finding the correct location to complete said Reminiscence...
|image2 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Reinforced Reminiscence 2.png
|text2  = Once you reach the correct location, use the Memory Fragment to match the Reminiscence with the actual site to complete it.
|image3 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Reinforced Reminiscence 3.png
|text3  = After the trial starts, the time will start ticking down. Once it finishes doing so, Sorush will receive a hint to help her find the correct location...
}}

;Intrepid Impulse
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Intrepid Impulse 1.png
|text1  = In Intrepid Impulse, Sorush must reach the destination within the time limit.<br>The more time Sorush has left upon completion and the more Valiant Corollas she obtains, the higher your challenge score will be.
|image2 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Intrepid Impulse 2.png
|text2  = During the trial, get close to Glowing Wreaths to borrow their power and sprint forward over a certain distance and temporarily expand your collection AoE for Valiant Corollas.
|image3 = Tutorial The Recollector's Path Intrepid Impulse 3.png
|text3  = Sleetdross Fruit also exist within the trials. After being hit by them, Sorush's vision will be briefly disrupted, and the time remaining on the trial will also decrease, resulting in a lower final score.
