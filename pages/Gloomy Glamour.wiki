|description    = A strange, vibrant plant. Its thick trunk and rare blue-violet leaves make it look particularly breathtaking.<br />Unlike many other plants with cold-hued flowers, the unique color of this plant comes from a specific ingredient in the soil, and it is the only known plant species that will react to this substance.<br />Due to this unique characteristic, this plant usually requires meticulous care when grown in horticulture and scores a hefty price as an ornamental species.
