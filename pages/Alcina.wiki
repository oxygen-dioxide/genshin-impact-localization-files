:'''[[Alcina]]:''' If you hadn't told me, I would never have known that he was in this line before.
:'''[[Rege]]:''' Heh. I mean, it's not completely unreasonable. Doing dirty business doesn't mean you don't accumulate experience, right?
:'''Rege:''' Now he's changed jobs to some sort of financial consultant, mentioning a few "investment trends" to the Boss every so often for some easy Mora. Pretty sweet deal.
:'''Alcina:''' Agreed. Speaking of which, I'm reminded of some kid who wasn't able to join the [[Spina di Rosula]].
:'''Alcina:''' Had a silver tongue, he did, but no real ability. Lately, I've heard that he's gotten mixed up in another faction, and he's been walking with a real swagger since.
:'''Rege:''' Ooh, that's dangerous behavior, ignoring the [[Palais Mermonia]] like that &mdash; reckon he'll be "invited" to sing at the [[Opera Epiclese|opera]] soon enough.
