==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You meet a strange person outside the forest.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Javi:''' This is strange... It should be around here. Why can't I find it?
:{{DIcon}} What are you looking for?
:'''Javi:''' You're... Oh, the Traveler, right? I've heard about you.
:'''Javi:''' I'm Javi, a... normal salesperson. I'm looking for the "Dream Box" I buried before.
:'''Paimon:''' That's a strange name... What is in it?
:'''Javi:''' Well... If I have to put it into words, it contains my childhood "dreams to be realized."
:{{DIcon}} Why did you do that?
:'''Javi:''' Hahaha, that was a childhood game I played with friends.
:'''Javi:''' We each wrote down the most precious dream we had then, and buried it here. We have agreed on a time when we are gonna gather here again and dig our "Dream Boxes" out.
:'''Javi:''' Now the time comes, but... Seems that I'm the only one remembering the promise.
:'''Javi:''' *sigh* That's okay, though... As long as they keep their dreams.
:'''Javi:''' Anyway, I'm coming to dig my box out, so that I can have some closure.
:'''Javi:''' But I searched around and found nothing. Could it be that someone took it?
:{{DIcon}} Did you leave a mark?
:{{DIcon}} So your dream has flown away...
::'''Javi:''' Hahaha... Can't say I disagree, since I can't even remember what I wrote...
::'''Javi:''' But even if my dream can fly away, the box cannot.
:'''Javi:''' I remember burying it beside a tree...
:'''Paimon:''' A tree? B&mdash;But Paimon sees lots of trees here!
:'''Javi:''' I didn't expect this as a child, you know. We only set up a tiny sign as a reminder.
:'''Javi:''' But it's all gone after all this time, and the trees nearby have totally grown different...
:'''Javi:''' I just got the vague impression that the box was buried somewhere near.
:'''Javi:''' Traveler, could you help me find it?
:{{DIcon}} But how?
::'''Javi:''' I buried the box near a tree, so... let's try digging beside the trees.
::'''Javi:''' Please, lend me a hand, Traveler. I'll pay you.
:{{DIcon}} It has already flown away...
::'''Javi:''' Yes, my dream has flown away, and that's exactly why I'm digging the box out to see my dream back then.
::'''Javi:''' Please, Traveler, just a tiny favor here. I'll have your payment ready.
:'''Javi:''' Look at all the trees here. I will never find it without help...
:{{DIcon}} Fine...
:'''Javi:''' Hehe, thank you. We'll split, then. I'm staying here, and you can search there.

;(Talk to Javi again)
:'''Javi:''' Nothing here either...
:'''Javi:''' *sigh* Come on, the box can't have grown legs...
----
;(Interact with the first dig spot)
:'''Paimon:''' It's not here... Let's check the other trees.

;(Interact with the second dig spot)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon sees nothing... Maybe it's beside another tree.

;(Upon finding the Dream)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh wait, there's actually a box here! Let's take it back to him.
;(Obtain {{Item|Javi's Dream}})
----
;(Give the "dream" to Javi)
:'''Javi:''' Oh no. This isn't my Dream Box.
:{{DIcon}} We've got a box.
::'''Javi:''' Haha... I've got one, too...
:{{DIcon}} You got one, too?
:'''Javi:''' I even opened it, and found a piece of paper with Ami's name on it.
:'''Javi:''' I remember that kid, the daughter of [[Jahangir]], who was always found near the food shop.
:'''Javi:''' So she dreamed of becoming a florist, who would care for a lot of flowers...
:'''Javi:''' That was unexpected. I always thought Jahangir was gonna pass the shop to her.
:{{DIcon}} Let's see your dream first.
:{{DIcon}} Here, your "Dream Box."
:'''Javi:''' Oh! I almost forgot, I must take a look at my own dream first...
:'''Javi:''' Lemme see...
:'''Javi:''' "I hope to be a Vanara, and live in the forest forever..."
:'''Javi:''' So that's my childhood dream? My goodness, I can't believe that's what I wished for...
:'''Javi:''' Come on... Kiddo, being a Vanara won't pay you much.
:{{DIcon}} I don't see anything wrong with that.
:{{DIcon}} Dreams are never good or bad.
:'''Javi:''' That's just some childish ideas. For someone at my age, dreams...
:'''Javi:''' ...
:'''Javi:''' Better think about ways to get more Mora, and that's what gives some good sleep.
:'''Javi:''' Enough about my boring dream, let's talk about Ami.
:'''Javi:''' I should definitely do something to make amends to her since I opened her "Dream Box" without consent.
:'''Javi:''' Well... Let me think, being a florist starts with learning how to plant flowers.
:'''Javi:''' I happened to have a spare flower pot that I can give her.
:'''Javi:''' Traveler, do you happen to know somewhere to get some flower seeds?
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you doing this?
::'''Javi:''' Hahaha... Let's just say I'm being spontaneous.
::'''Javi:''' I will never realize my dream, because of all the years behind me, and... the fact that I don't actually care about the dream anymore.
::'''Javi:''' But Ami is still young. She can still try to realize her dream.
::'''Javi:''' As a boring adult, gifting her a flower pot is the least I can do. Hope that would show my support and encourage her.
:'''Javi:''' I'm counting on you for the seeds, Traveler. See you beside Jahangir's shop.
----
;(Upon obtaining the seeds<!-- or if the player already has some in their inventory -->)
:'''Paimon:''' These seeds should do. Let's find Mr. Javi.
----
;(Approach Ami and Javi)
:'''Ami:''' Is this... for me?
:'''Ami:''' I wasn't serious about the box or the paper! So it's alright, you don't need to apologize!
:'''Javi:''' Don't worry, this flower pot has no use for me anyway. Please take it.
:'''Javi:''' I've asked someone to find some seeds. They should arrive at any minute...
:{{DIcon}} Seeds are coming!
:{{DIcon}} Here, the flower seeds.
:'''Javi:''' Huh? When did you arrive? I didn't even notice...
:'''Javi:''' Ahem... Ami, you wanted to be a florist, right? You can start with planting these.
:'''Ami:''' Thanks... But if I do that beside my dad's shop, bugs might get into the pot...
:'''Ami:''' That would be a pity, for the bugs in the pot, and the grown-ups having bugs in their food.
:'''Ami:''' But if I move the flowers further, I might forget about them. That's also a pity, for the dying flowers...
:'''Ami:''' Besides, dad is always busy, and he never lets me go far...
:'''Javi:''' Um... We can take care of it together, if you want. How about that?
:'''Javi:''' Although I could only visit after work, I do have some free time.
:'''Ami:''' Great! But dad might say no...
:'''Javi:''' Mr. Jahangir and I are basically friends. He should agree if we talk to him together.
:'''Ami:''' Okay! I... I want more flowers, then! Sumeru Rose is my favorite! Someday... I'll surround my dad's shop with Sumeru Roses!
:'''Javi:''' Good, that's a beautiful dream, little girl. Let's do our best for that!
:{{DIcon}} Please save one for me.
:{{DIcon}} You can do it!
:'''Ami:''' Thank you! Lemme think... I want a Sweet Flower, too, and what else...
:'''Javi:''' So the kid is really into flowers. Hope she could stick to that dream...
:'''Javi:''' Hehe... Hope she won't grow up like me, a common and boring guy.
:'''Javi:''' Ahem! Thanks for your help, Traveler. Please take this as compensation for your trouble.
:{{DIcon}} Living with all your heart is more than common.
:{{DIcon}} Living with all your heart is never boring.
:'''Javi:''' Thanks. I'm not complaining, though.
:'''Javi:''' I was just... having some thoughts after seeing the "dream" I've buried.
:'''Javi:''' Alright, I should leave now. Thanks for your help today, Traveler.
:'''Javi:''' Maybe I should... write down another "dream" and bury it back there...
