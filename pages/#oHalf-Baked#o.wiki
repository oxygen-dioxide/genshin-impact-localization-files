==Profile==
Half-Baked is the Saurian companion of [[Wactana]]. She gave it his name after being reminded of a chef friend from [[Sumeru]], and had him take care of four [[Alpaca]]s, as it was what he wanted to do, claiming that he would lose his fur from stress if he wasn't on alpaca duty.

When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] approached the alpacas, Half-Baked believed that the alpacas were in danger and attacked them. Wactana came afterwards and apologized, stating that Half-Baked was always antsy whenever strangers came near them. Wactana allowed [[Little One]] to try and befriend an alpaca, while Half-Baked noticed that one of the alpacas had hid. The Traveler and Little One noticed an alpaca in a precarious spot and brought it back to its herd, resulting in Half-Baked being satisfied that all alpacas were accounted for.
