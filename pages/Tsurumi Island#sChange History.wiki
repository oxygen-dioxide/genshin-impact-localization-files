:'''2022-04-02:'''
* The interaction between [[Tsurumi Island]]'s [[fog]], [[Teleport Waypoint]]s, and [[Statue of The Seven]] was updated so that Teleport Waypoints within foggy areas no longer show up on the [[map]] if the Statue of The Seven has not yet been touched. Previously, Teleport Waypoints inside foggy areas showed up on the map if the Statue of The Seven had not yet been touched, allowing players to bypass that aspect of Tsurumi Island's fog.<section end="fog-tp-sot7-interaction" />
