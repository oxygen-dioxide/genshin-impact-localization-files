==Trivia==
* In the Chinese and Japanese titles of the track, the term {{ja|{{w|Zeami_Motokiyo#Kakyo|花鏡}}|Kakyou|The Mirror of the Flower}} refers to a treatise on Noh theatre by Zeami Motokiyo which discusses vocalisation and the spirituality of acting. Notably, it is famous for its discourse on puppets, suggesting that an actor on stage is actually an illusory puppet generated from the actor's mind. The term {{ja|百韻|rm=Hyakuin}} also occurs in a form of collaborative Japanese poetry called {{w|Renga}}, literally meaning "a hundred verses."
