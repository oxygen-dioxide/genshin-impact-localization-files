;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This should be the place Miko mentioned, right?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mizuki! That was quick...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' All thanks to you two. With what I learned from those two guys, I managed to give [[Murasaki]] and [[Shion]] effective treatment as soon as I got back. That meant I was free to head out again as soon as I received your message.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' So. This is where Emura Ichigensai lives?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure hope so, 'cause this is our only lead... *sniff* Wait, do you guys smell that too? Some kind of fragrance. Seems like it's coming from inside!
:{{DIcon}} I smelled the same scent yesterday, too.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Then that confirms it: We've come to the right place. Now, we may face great danger once we're inside...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' So from here on out, stay close to me, and stay focused. I don't want either of you getting hurt.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry about us.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm! We'll be fine &mdash; you just focus on what you need to do.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 1 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Alright, fine... I suppose you're used to leading the charge.

;(Enter the domain)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... This is not what Paimon was expecting...
:{{DIcon}} It looks familiar.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, this is creepy... Feels like there are loads of eyes staring at us...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 2 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Calm, yet repressed... The signs are all there...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it, Mizuki? Figured something out?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 2 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Nothing new &mdash; just further confirmation of my suspicions. Emura Ichigensai should be hiding deep inside this place... Stay close to me.

;(Approach the platform)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He set up an ambush?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Seems like we're not welcome here.

;(After defeating the enemies)
:;(Emura Chuuya appears from thin air)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 01.ogg}} '''Emura Ichigensai:''' Miss Yumemizuki... You found me at last. Ah, I see you've brought some friends with you. Please forgive my lack of hospitality.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Emura Chuuya... So it is you.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mizuki was right after all... Paimon wasn't expecting him to be so polite, though.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 02.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Please, do not call me by that name anymore. The old me was plagued by negative emotions. But I have parted ways with them now. That period of my life is consigned to the past, and the name along with it.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' You have to listen to me &mdash; there is no way to get rid of all of your negative emotions. This life you're living now is a lie.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 03.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Haha... Your perspective is most amusing.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's so funny? Don't you know you're harming people?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 04.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Harming people? That's what you believe? Very well, I understand and accept your perspective &mdash; even if you cannot afford me the same courtesy in return.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, what's up with him? He's being so calm and polite, so why does everything he says make Paimon wanna punch him?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 05.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' As you can see, Miss Yumemizuki, all my psychological problems have been completely resolved.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 06.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' I must thank you for your attempts to {{Sic|diagnosis|expected=diagnose}} my condition. But I see now that the truth is far simpler than you were proposing.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 07.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' All my misery was merely a consequence of human frailty. I could not hope to remove my emotional impurities on my own strength.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 08.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' I lived in fear and anger. Fear that I was not worthy of other people's attention. Anger at how they invalidated me.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 09.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' I became a slave to my emotions. They turned me into a wretched and loathsome creature, hostile to everyone... But things are different now &mdash; I have acquired the ability to eradicate those emotions for good.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 10.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' No longer will I be afraid. Never again will I be stirred to anger... No, I am filled now with only one emotion, and that is happiness. I have become humanity perfected!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' What I'm hearing is that you've developed your own unique understanding of psychological issues. So how about you play therapist this time? I have a couple of cases I'd love to hear your thoughts on.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 11.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' I would be delighted.
:;([[Susukida]] is shown in the mental image)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The first is a soldier with poor control of his temper. He flies off the handle too easily, and it gets him into all sorts of trouble. This is having a significant impact on his daily life, and he's developed symptoms of depression as a result.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 12.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' He simply needs to let go of his anger. Then, he will surely find peace and happiness.
:;([[Umihiko]] is shown in the mental image)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The second is a fisherman who's developed thalassophobia. Now he is unable to provide for his family, which is causing him immense anxiety.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 13.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Oh of course, he must cast his fear far away, and forget it ever existed. Then, he can return to the sea at once!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I'm sorry, but you're wrong on both counts.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 14.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The soldier's anger is rooted in his strongly held principles. Yes, his rage can make him reckless, but it also fuels his deep desire to stand against injustice.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Losing his anger made him passive and apathetic. He now stands by and does nothing as bandits attack innocent people.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The fisherman's fear made him one of the most reliable sailors around. Thanks to his cautiousness and diligence, accidents were a rare occurrence among his crew despite the dangers of their profession.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' But after forgetting his fear, he destroyed the fruits of the entire crew's labor on his first return to the sea.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 11.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Fascinating, isn't it? Anger gives people the courage to stand up for what they believe in, and fear nurtures care and attention.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 15.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 12.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Emotions are integral to human dreams, and after many years of dealing with their dreams, the [[yumekui-baku]] have learned an important secret about human emotions:
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 13.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Negative emotions do not just go away &mdash; they will always be there. This is true for everyone.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 14.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Not only that, but their presence is essential. You can't have a healthy human psyche without negative emotion.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 15.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' So, do you have any idea what you've done to those poor men?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 16.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' ...What an amusing theory. In fact, I do remember those two, but I'm afraid that the only emotion I sense in them now is happiness.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 17.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' How can you believe that negative emotions are required for a healthy psyche? It's a laughable theory. Don't you remember how I was when we first met? You call that "healthy"?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 16.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Acknowledging that negative emotions exist doesn't mean giving them free reign over our minds and lives. Humans have a whole gamut of emotions. They're supposed to keep each other in balance.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 17.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' But if that balance gets disrupted, emotions start working against each other. Untethered rage cripples the capacity to be careful and considerate. Uncontained fear drives people to abandon beliefs they once held dear.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 18.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The person you were when you first came to my practice only proves this further.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 18.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Uh... I... I...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 19.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' You were dominated by your emotions. Under their influence, you deliberately inflicted pain on other people. Meanwhile, the person you are now is so lost that you aren't even aware of the pain you're bringing to others.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 20.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' This diagnosis is going to sound harsh, but I'm afraid it's accurate:
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 21.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' You've simply gone from one extreme to another. You say you've reached perfection, but you're just as dysfunctional now as where you started.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 19.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' You... Hahaha... How entertaining. Still... There's no need for me to argue back. You have failed to provoke me...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 20.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' I will forgive you for this offense, because I know my present perfection to be a fact. I have direct and incontrovertible evidence.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 21.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' You once told me that nightmares are the result of a build-up of negative emotions. But ever since I acquired my present abilities, I never had another nightmare again.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 22.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Clearly, that proves that all of my negative emotions have been definitively eradicated.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 22.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I'm afraid not. Look where we are right now... We're inside your nightmare.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 23.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' What...?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder! Paimon knew something was up the moment we arrived...
:{{DIcon}} I knew it.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 23.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The enemies that we encountered were manifestations of his negative emotions. That can only happen in a nightmare.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 24.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' No... That can't be...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 24.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That entity claimed it could remove your negative emotions. But all it did was separate them and store them deep in your subconscious beyond your reach. There, they were left to fester.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 25.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Your situation is far worse than that of the other victims... It has deceived you at a much deeper level. You can't even perceive that at this very moment, you're in the middle of a nightmare.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 25.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Haha... How laughable... Fear? No, there is no fear left in me... This is all just a terrible joke... This is no dream! No... Argh...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Something's appeared behind him...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 kuroyume 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hahaha... So, my arch-nemesis has seen through my trickery.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 kuroyume 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Clearly, you came prepared... The emotional cocoon I had wrapped him in was all but impenetrable, yet still you managed to tear it down.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 26.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' So, it IS you... Just as I thought.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is that?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 27.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' A nightmare monster... A fearsome [[youkai]] that was once the bane of Inazuma.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 28.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' We yumekui-baku eat the nightmares of humans, while they called those nightmares their home. So, we were natural enemies.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 29.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' When I heard {{Traveler}} recount that strange dream, I knew that this was a possibility...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 30.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' But it's still a shock to see one of our long-lost arch-enemies in the flesh. They were supposed to have gone extinct long ago...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 kuroyume 03.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Then allow me to formally introduce myself. My name is Kuroyume, and I am the last of my kind.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 31.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Kuroyume... That's a name I haven't heard in a long, long time. How have you survived all these years?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 kuroyume 04.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Likewise, Yumemizuki is a name that takes me back to a different age... Although I must say &mdash; we may be born enemies, but I have never felt any great animosity towards you personally.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 kuroyume 05.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Ultimately, the fall of the nightmare-monsters was the fault of our hosts. Humans are such fragile creatures...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 kuroyume 06.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' But now, I have found a way to revive my kind, and you are too late to stop me!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 emurachuuya 26.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' Ugh!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 33 mizuki 32.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Oh no... We've got to catch up to him!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Faced with Mizuki's psychological onslaught, the entity controlling Emura Chuuya finally reveals itself. This youkai &mdash; known as a "nightmare" &mdash; is the ancient enemy of the baku, and the mastermind that must be defeated to solve the current crisis...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... What's happening? Paimon's feeling dizzy all of a sudden...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That's the feeling of rejection. It's so strong...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Quick, after him!

:(After going down the platform)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There he is! Right there!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, what happened to all the paths?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' He's repressing his emotions even harder...

;(Hint)
::Try using Mizuki's {{Color|help|Elemental Skill}} to reach the next platform.

;(Entering the final room)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There! He's got nowhere left to run!

;(Try to approach Emura Chuuya)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! What's happening to the ground?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Watch out!

;(Fall into the mist)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I used my powers to cushion our fall... Is everyone alright?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we've fallen from bigger heights before... The bigger issue here is that he got away, and we were so close! Gah...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' We've been completely cut off. That creature has taken complete control of his consciousness... We'll never catch him.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Would it be easier if we wake up now and go catch him in the real world? If this is his nightmare, he must be asleep somewhere, right?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Remember the fragrance we smelled on our way in? That's how the monster lures people into the dream state. Now we're inside, we can't get out unless we manage to defeat him in his true form.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' He's turned Emura Chuuya's nightmare into his lair. There's only one way to force him into the open, and that's by finding a way to eat this nightmare.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eat this nightmare? But is that even possible?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Not only is it possible, Paimon, it's quite literally my job.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knows that! It's just... we all saw what happened to Murasaki and Shion, and this nightmare is super intense... Paimon's worried this won't turn out well.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...This monster has harmed too many people. We have to stop it.
:{{DIcon}} But, Mizuki...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' It's okay, I knew what I was getting into. Let's get moving.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Hmm... We may not have caught him, but our chase wasn't in vain. He led us deep inside his dream... We should now be at the subconscious layer that makes up its core.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's so dark...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That's what happens if you leave your negative emotions to fester...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' There must be a lot of emotional fragments in this place. We need to follow them one by one, until we reach our destination.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but what is our destination?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 3 mizuki 11.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Where the light is.

;(Approach the first fragment)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 4 father 01.ogg}} '''"Father":''' If I say it's your fault, it's your fault! Do you understand me!?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 4 father 02.ogg}} '''"Father":''' You shouldn't go running around with that stupid thing in your hand! Do you want to go hungry tonight?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... The atmosphere here is so oppressive. Is it anger? Or fear?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 4 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Be careful. Every time we draw near to one of these fragments, we'll experience the underlying emotion on a visceral level.

;(Approach the second fragment)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 5 father 01.ogg}} '''"Father":''' You? A writer? Didn't they reject you already?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 5 father 02.ogg}} '''"Father":''' Get rid of this trash. Go find a real job!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw... Poor guy, Paimon feels so bad for him...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 5 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...We shouldn't stay here. Let's keep moving.

;(Approach the third fragment)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 6 classmate 01.ogg}} '''Classmate:''' Haha... I won. Another round?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 6 classmate 02.ogg}} '''Classmate:''' ...That guy? He never joins in with anything. Why should we go out of our way to invite him?

:{{A|vo mzklq004 6 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Nope, not here, either...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... *gasp* Look! There's the light!

;(Approach the fourth fragment)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 youngemurachuuya 01.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' *sob*...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is this place...?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' It's his sorrow... Yes, sheer overwhelming sorrow...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Human emotions exist in a delicate balance. When that balance is lost, negative emotions spiral out of control, and go on to fuel nightmares.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' By isolating these negative emotions and allowing them to fester, that monster has completely destroyed his emotional balance. That's why he was able to create such a powerful nightmare.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' If we want to restore balance, we have to dispose of the excess negative emotion.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so that's what you mean when you talk about "eating nightmares"?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Well done, Paimon. Very clever.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright... what's the next step?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I need to find a way to separate the negative emotions out. For that, I need a special medium...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Sorrow might just do the job. As long as it's kept in check, it can calm the waves of emotions and help him regain some measure of control.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mother 01.ogg}} '''"Mother":''' Let it out, Chuuya, let the tears flow. You'll feel better after a good cry.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 youngemurachuuya 02.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' *sob*...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' This process will untangle his unbridled fear and anger, his unresolved resentment, and his unshakeable despair...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' These excess emotions will be separated out from the rest. They are the source of this nightmare.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...Argh!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mizuki!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 11.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' It's alright... It's an unpleasant flavor, but I've tasted it thousands of times.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 12.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' A good cry can work wonders, even though he seems beyond helping... I think he should be able to take another step out from the swamp of despair now.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mother 02.ogg}} '''"Mother":''' Are you ready to come out now, Chuuya?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mother 03.ogg}} '''"Mother":''' I'll be waiting for you right here, son. I'd love to listen to more of your stories, whenever you're ready.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 youngemurachuuya 03.ogg}} '''Emura Chuuya:''' ...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 mizuki 13.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Phew... Alright, there goes that nightmare. Hopefully, this marks the beginning of a sweeter dream...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Amazing... Suddenly, Paimon feels so relaxed, and maybe even... happy?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 kuroyume 01.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' ...I thought I had found the perfect host. But you found the one weakness in his emotional armor...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah! He's back again!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 7 kuroyume 02.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Freeing a single host from my clutches changes nothing. You cannot stop me! I told you, you are too late!
:;(The player is transported to another area)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is this place?
:{{DIcon}} A new dream?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I can't believe it... He's brought us to the borderland...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Borderland"?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' To put it simply, it's a dream within a dream... A space hidden deep within the collective Inazuman subconscious. A dream that can exist even without a host.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' This must be how that monster managed to survive the extinction of his kind... he hid here.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mizuki, that eye...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' He's trying to turn this place into a nightmare so he'll be more at home... And he's creating copies of himself...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' This place is connected to the dreams of every human in the nation. From here, he can place a copy of himself in every dream.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' If he succeeds, then he'll have effectively revived his kind already...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then we know what we need to do: We gotta take this guy down! ...Do we think a sword will do the job?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Maybe &mdash; if we can get close enough to reach his core... But he's brought the nightmares of all of his victims here, and that gives him an immense amount of power.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Dealing with this many in one go is going to take a different approach. We need a power to rival his nightmares... the power of sweet dreams.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sweet dreams? Where are we gonna find those?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 8 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Lost minds &mdash; there should be some around here, and some of them will have come from sweet dreams originally... Come on, follow me!

;(Keep going forward)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Careful. We've got to move quietly.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The nightmare monster has usurped control here. We need to stay out of his sight.

;(Hint)
::The nightmare monster has opened its eyes. Quickly find {{Color|#FF5F40|cover}} to avoid its gaze.

;(Hint shown if the player is caught in Kuroyume's gaze when he opens his eyes)
::Danger! The nightmare's gaze is upon you. Find {{Color|#FF5F40|cover}} as soon as possible.

;(Interact with Sweet Dream's Resonance&colon; Passion)

;(After talking to the second dream)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Alright, we've gathered enough power to proceed. Time to face him head-on!

;(Approach the marker)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 20 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The core should be just up ahead. This will be a tough fight...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why? Are these sweet dreams not... sweet enough?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 20 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I just wish we could've gathered some more... But these are all we could find in the immediate vicinity.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 20 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Which means, we're running out of time. Our chances of success are shrinking by the minute &mdash; we have to act now.

:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Not yet, it isn't!

;(After defeating the first wave of enemies)
:;(The two Sweet Dream's Resonance from before join the fight as allies)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Now! Use the power of the good dreams!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 99 kuroyume 02.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' I think you will find it to be quite ineffective against the power of my nightmares...

;(After defeating the second wave of enemies)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 01.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Gah... I must confess, I am somewhat confused. Both of us bring happiness to humans now. Why must you still treat me as your enemy?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Because the happiness you provide is a lie. All you do is make them forget that their negative emotions exist, and now they're living under the illusion that they're gone for good.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' All the while, these repressed feelings continue to fester in their subconscious, eventually becoming nightmares intense enough to become your home.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Your kind has always thrived by magnifying your hosts' negative emotions for your own gain. What you're doing now is no different from what you've always done.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 02.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Incorrect... This time, I shall change the fate of my entire kind!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 03.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' When a human becomes dominated by their negative emotions, they lose their ability to survive. That is how my kin died out.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 04.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' But I can give them a fantasy instead, turning them into the perfect hosts, capable of surviving no matter how dire the situation in their subconscious gets.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 05.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' This is the path to our revival! My kin shall rise again!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...You do realize what that means, don't you? You've just gone from one extreme to the other.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 06.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Oh, I am perfectly aware. There is nothing you can say that I do not already know... For over all the years that your kind has been learning about the human mind, I have been hiding here, watching, and learning from the fruits of your labor.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 07.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' But I'm afraid I could not care less for the moral burdens that you impose upon yourselves. The health of the human psyche is of precisely zero interest to me.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 08.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Now, here is a question well worth thinking about... If we allowed the humans themselves to decide, which of us would they really choose? You? Or me?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 09.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Do you see now? I won this battle long before you ever set foot inside this dream!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aaah, what's going on!?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' He's growing stronger... But we've exhausted the power of the sweet dreams already...
:{{DIcon}} So we need more sweet dreams then?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Even if we could find more sweet dreams now, it still wouldn't be enough... Ugh!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 10.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' If you accept that negative emotions are an immutable presence in the human mind, then you must also know that such emotions include apathy and sloth.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 11.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' Without the yumekui-baku there to hold their hand and walk them through dream regulation therapy, do you honestly think that anyone would ever be inclined to embrace their negative emotions?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 kuroyume 12.ogg}} '''Kuroyume:''' No, they would sooner run from reality, to forget all about their troubles, and live inside an illusion!
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' But, the whole reason I wanted to become a psychologist...

:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 11.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Longing, caused by separation... So bitter, and yet the experience led to a whole new journey for you. If you keep pressing on, maybe even more precious memories await...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 12.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Despair, caused by failure... Icy-cold, and yet in conquering this despair you gained the courage to face the lightning.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 13.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Regret, caused by missed opportunity... A harsh aftertaste, and yet it's only through that loss that we can learn to appreciate everything we have.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 14.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' And after all these flavors comes... sweetness, passion, and refreshed hope. So, that's why I was able to taste a sweet dream at our first meeting...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 15.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Long before you ever met me, you'd already gained the courage to never avoid or run away from your feelings... And all your nightmares had become the fuel for sweeter dreams.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 9 mizuki 16.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' The power that you have gained by processing everything from your long journey is surely far stronger than any power wielded by that creature.

:{{DIcon}} My good dreams helped, right?

:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' {{Traveler}}, could I pick your brain with another question? What do you think humans tend to have more of, happy dreams, or bad ones?
:{{DIcon}} Happy ones?
::{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 04a 1.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' If only that were true...
:{{DIcon}} Bad dreams?
::{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 04b 1.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' You've noticed it too, then?
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Most people struggle to deal with their negative emotions. They bottle them up inside, until they've festered and turned into nightmares.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' As a result, humans have far more bad dreams than good ones. And most happy dreams are short and fleeting. They are so rare that it's basically impossible for them to be shared with others.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Heck, there are even people out there who only have the mind space to have happy dreams after they've given us their bad ones...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Which is all to say that the dreams we get to taste are usually bad ones. No matter how hard we try, we can't seem to change this state of affairs.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I once believed that the only reason we yumekui-baku existed was to serve as a disposal method for nightmares. It's a fate that we cannot escape, no matter how many dreams we eat, or how many years pass by...
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Even though I call myself a clinical psychologist, I also have dark thoughts sometimes. I suppose that's the only problem I have.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 11.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Still, after learning the principles of psychology, I came up with a new way to look at all of this.
:;([[Ritou]] is shown in the background)
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 12.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' If we can use psychotherapy to help people to come to terms with their emotions, they'll gain the ability to deal with their nightmares on their own, so they'll no longer need to call upon us for assistance.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 13.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That way, more and more people can free up their minds for truly happy dreams, until there'll be enough to share around.
:{{DIcon}} That's a beautiful wish.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 14.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Haha, a naive one, more like. Even though I've run this business for quite a long time now, it still hasn't come true &mdash; not even once.

:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 15.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' So, I must thank you. Because after meeting you, I finally became sure that my wish is achievable.
:{{A|vo mzklq004 11 mizuki 16.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' And knowing that is all the treatment I need against the dark thoughts I sometimes have.
