{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Iron Shoulder:''' Well, you look free. Done for the day?
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything to note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Iron Shoulder knows; Version 1)
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' Now you mention it, a guy I work with said he'd seen some very peculiar Crystal Ore not far from here.
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' They say this type's called Magical Crystal Ore. Some kind of special variety, a big step up from the usual stuff.
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' If you're interested, you should go and look into it. Here, I'll mark the location for you...
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' ...There. That's the rough area, anyway. Mining's a good, honest job &mdash; so off you go, maybe it'll do you some good!
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Iron Shoulder knows; Version 2)
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' Now you mention it, a guy I work with said he'd seen some Crystal Ore not far from here.
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' But work's so busy I don't have the time to check it out.
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' If you're interested, you should go and look into it. Here, I'll mark the location for you...
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' ...There. That's the rough area, anyway. Mining's a good, honest job &mdash; so off you go, maybe it'll do you some good!
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Iron Shoulder knows)
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' Nothing I've noticed. Not in the last couple of days, anyway...
:::'''Iron Shoulder:''' But surely you must have more important things to do than sightseeing?
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(Probably after [[Rite of Descension]])
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' If we hadn't gone through with the Rite of Parting, I would have found it hard to believe that Rex Lapis is gone.
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' I used to think that he alone would remain, even long after Liyu Harbor any of the seven nations had passed away.
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' *sigh* I have no idea what his passing means for Liyue, or for the Blackcliff Forge... I just hope I won't lose my job!
:{{DIcon}} Done with work?
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' Oh? You don't have a job? That won't do...
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' You should find a job soon, or you might get too used to idling about.
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' Once you've done work for over a decade like me, you'll slowly begin to understand your place in this world,
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' You'll understand that you're just a normal person, but a single screw in Lapis' great work. Then you can be considered to have matured.
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' If not, you'll become like those who roam the streets every day, never having grown out of being children despite their white hair.
:{{DIcon}} Well, you look quite idle yourself.
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' It's called "catching your breath".
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' I can do the work of three people in a single day. That's why everyone calls me "Iron Shoulder."
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' I ply my trade faithfully at the Blackcliff Forge, and though we always hear some weird rumors drifting over from Liyue Harbor...
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' Well, I don't pay them any mind. Liyue has prospered for a thousand years, and even if the sky were to fall, Rex Lapis would hold it up. What's the worst that could happen?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Iron Shoulder:''' Indeed, let's cut the idle talk and get back to work.
