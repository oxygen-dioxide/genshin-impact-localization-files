# Talk to The Balladeer
# Defeat the [[Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom]]
# Enter Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's last memory
#* The player will be teleported into the Quest Domain [[The Greater Lord's Remaining Consciousness]].
# Talk to Nahida
# Leave this place using the Boat of Consciousness
# Reach the Irminsul from the past
#* The player will be teleported into the Quest Domain [[That Day Under Irminsul]].
# Find the remaining consciousness of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata
# Talk to Nahida
# Talk to Paimon

==Gameplay Notes==
* Leaving during the middle of any of the four quest-specific Domains will place the player back at the Sanctuary of Surasthana, as if Step 2 was just completed, but upon interacting with the domain's start point, the most recent unfinished domain can be re-entered.
* During Step 5, Nahida will join the party as a trial character.
* The first time players fight Shouki no Kami's second phase, players are not required to deal damage and only need to survive until the cinematic begins.
* Two major events occur in this quest that result in significant changes to the game world at its conclusion:
** [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] is removed from [[Irminsul]], effectively erasing her from the history of [[Teyvat]]. Nearly all texts, descriptions, and voice-overs that reference her are changed to reflect this. (A more detailed list can be found in [[Irminsul#Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Irminsul § Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].)
** [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] shuts down the [[Akasha System|Akasha]]. Characters previously shown to wear Akasha Terminals no longer do so, as they have been rendered useless.

==Achievements==
* Completing Step 7 grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[...I'm Sorry, Sir, But You're Ineligible]]''.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Although you have saved Lesser Lord Kusanali, there is no time to celebrate or rest, for there is a nascent god to stop and Irminsul to save... Now, the fate of Teyvat is in your hands.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After the previous quest)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We might as well prepare for a fight, (Traveler).
:{{A|vo xmaq304 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When we're done, we can take a walk around. After all, we missed out on a lot of stuff when we were locked up.

;(Talk to Viraf outside the Sanctuary of Surasthana, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 viraf 01.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' The blond-haired Traveler? How did you come out from the Sanctuary of Surasthana? It's normally forbidden to enter that place.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, sorry, we don't know the rules here...
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 viraf 02.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' It's fine, just pay more attention next time. Anyway, I'm looking for Grand Sage [[Azar]]. Have you seen him?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 viraf 03.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' The more I think about it, the more I believe there's something fishy about Alhaitham's return. I need to let the Grand Sage know somehow...
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're finally starting to put two and two together...

;(Talk to Vihar outside the Akademiya, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 vihar 01.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Hey, it's you guys! How did your plan go? Are you here for [[Nilou]]?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It went really well! And yeah, where's Nilou?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 vihar 02.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Great to hear! Nilou's already returned to the Grand Bazaar. Just now, a crowd of Akademiya students came by to ask Nilou for her signature. I've never seen her run away so fast!
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 vihar 03.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' To think the Akademiya wants to ban artistic performances... Hehe, I think their students would be the first to disagree.

;(Talk to Rahman inside the Grand Bazaar, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 rahman 01.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Eh? How did you find the time to walk around? Did you manage to rescue Lesser Lord Kusanali?
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We did! She's handling some Akasha stuff right now.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 rahman 02.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' That's great, haha. Just now, Dehya went to find [[Asfand]], the senior consultant of the Corps of Thirty, and explained everything to him.
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 rahman 03.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' In response, Asfand said, "Why didn't you tell me earlier. If it was to rescue the Dendro Archon, we would've helped as well," hahaha...
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq304 rahman 04.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' I didn't know we could have even counted the city guards of the Corps of Thirty among our potential reinforcements. It looks like we were a bit too conservative with our plan.
----
;(Enter the Sanctuary of Surasthana)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How's it going, Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm done with the parts that needed my involvement to complete.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Although it's my first time working with the Akasha like this, its internal structure and operation procedures are easy for me to understand. Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's design is truly brilliant.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Oh, also, this is for you.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What's this little floaty thingy?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's a small device I put together just now. You can think of it as an upgraded Akasha Terminal.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You may not need it right now, but it should be helpful in certain situations.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait! This thing has the same characteristics as Paimon!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're both small things that float...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* All the things that make Paimon special got copied... When Paimon appears with the Traveler from now on, people won't remember Paimon because she isn't unique anymore...
:{{DIcon}} Are you actually upset...?
:{{DIcon}} It looks completely different from you!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's alright, Paimon. It can't replace you.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's only a flying device, but you're (Traveler)'s irreplaceable friend.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Waah, you're so good at comforting people, Nahida. If only (Traveler) was as smart as you...
:{{DIcon}} Hmm...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hm? I was simply telling you what I feel to be the truth. I wasn't trying to comfort you.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida, you're a natural at this! What you just said made Paimon even happier!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' By the way, there's something I need to confess...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Even though I'm the archon and in control of myself again, I'm not very good at fighting...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You may have heard that an archon's power is derived from their people's faith. However, I'm not as well-loved as Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If we get into a situation where combat is our only option, I'll have to count on you, and I'll do my best to provide support.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry.
:{{DIcon}} Fighting is my forte.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm glad I can rely on you.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, so the God of Wisdom isn't good at fighting. That actually sounds about right.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 4 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I've located where the false god is. Time is of the essence, so let's skip to it.
----
;(Enter Deus Foundry)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is this place? Is this really the way we need to go?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... Who woulda thought there'd be a place like this hidden right slap bang in the middle of the city!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The sages wanted to realize their god creation plan without being discovered. The safest and most convenient way would be to build within the Akademiya itself.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's true. They were already hiding one god, so why not two?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Judging from the structure here, the project is a huge undertaking. The sages really saw the god creation plan as their ultimate goal.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But this place doesn't seem like it could have been constructed by the Akademiya alone...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Fatui under The Doctor sure didn't hold back &mdash; they provided a lot of technological support.
:{{DIcon}} It's to help one of their own Harbingers become a god, after all.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, or else they wouldn't have been that generous!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Is that it, though? I've always felt that this "Doctor" is different from the Akademiya sages. He doesn't seem to share their sense of urgency...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Instead of being interested in the end product, it's like he's enjoying the experimental process.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... The Fatui Harbingers are all such weirdos, so The Doctor being weird is actually normal.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So... this Fatui that they're trying to turn into a god... is called "The Balladeer"?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We had previously come into contact with his consciousness. He harbors particularly strong obsessions...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' One is the desire for a Gnosis, since he was created to be the vessel for one.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The other obsession is probably related to his past. I can't quite explain it.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knows that he was a prototype puppet for the Raiden Shogun before he became a Fatui Harbinger...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's why he wants a Gnosis so badly. There's no way he'd willingly be a test subject, not with that temper and ego of his.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It sounds like you know The Balladeer quite well.
:{{DIcon}} We've had a few encounters...
:{{DIcon}} But none of them were pleasant.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I see. Tell me more about him and what he's like...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The more we know now, the better we can plan for and react to any future situation.

:'''You tell Nahida everything you know about The Balladeer...'''

:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Ah... I see. How fascinating.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 5 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Alright, time to go. Let's get through here and meet him in person.

;(Approach the pipes with horizontal brass plates)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks like we can climb up these pipes...

;(Approach the central structure)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The pattern on the ground seems to be all messed up... Let's go around and see if there's a way to fix it.

;(Approach the cart)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems to have stopped. Let's continue.

;(Approach the stuck cart)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, the cart is stuck. Maybe there's something wrong with the tracks. Let's try adjusting the direction of the device to clear the tracks.

;(Exit the elevator)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Looking at its operational status, we must prepare for the worst. The god they wanted to create... is likely close to completion, or already completed.
:{{DIcon}} That's not a surprise...
:{{DIcon}} I've already seen him control the weather.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, what should we do... Paimon can't imagine how hard it would be to fight against a Fatui Harbinger with a Gnosis...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Are you nervous, Paimon?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you really want to know... of course Paimon's nervous! Aren't you too, Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, I am. This is probably the first time I'm faced with a calamity of this degree since my birth.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I feel not just nervous, but curious as well.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Curious...? Curious about what?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Curious about our fate.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' To me, everything we perceive in this world, everything we learn, and everything that happens to us is considered knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' And if it's a form of knowledge, then it can be understood.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' However, only fate is about that which has yet to occur, so it has always drawn my curiosity.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So to me, "fate" is the ultimate knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's also why I love observing humans and all the things that happen to them. It all brings me great satisfaction.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' And now, at long last, I'm not just an observer anymore.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I will personally experience my own fate, with you by my side. Hehe, isn't this such a wonderfully exciting thing?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so that's what you mean! Paimon thinks she understands what you're feeling.
:{{DIcon}} I'm also looking forward to it.
:{{DIcon}} We won't lose.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 6 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Agreed! Okay, let's continue on. I can sense "his" aura from here...
;(Exit the domain)
;(A cinematic plays)
{{Cutscene Description|After entering the depths of the foundry, you come face to face with the very core of the god creation plan &mdash; the Fatui Harbinger known as The Balladeer. Just as Nahida reaches out with her hand, seeming to summon a certain power, The Balladeer suddenly wakes up and repels all of you. Although the sages haven't gotten the chance to infuse the Divine Knowledge Capsules into him, the power of a god has already been vested in The Balladeer. Abandoning his former name, "Kunikuzushi," The Balladeer has become a real god &mdash; Shouki no Kami.}}
:;(Nahida uses her power on The Balladeer, awakening him)
::'''The Balladeer:''' Who would have thought...
::'''The Balladeer:''' The world would be so eager for my "birth"
::'''The Balladeer:''' I remember you
::'''The Balladeer:''' Buer, the God of Wisdom
::'''The Balladeer:''' And standing beside you... the Traveler
::'''Paimon:''' Is he all-knowing and powerful now like Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?
::'''Nahida:''' No, I can't feel the same kind of divinity I felt from the Greater Lord
::'''Nahida:''' It seems that the sages didn't get the chance to infuse the Divine Knowledge Capsules into him
::'''Nahida:''' But even still...
::'''Nahida:''' He has undoubtedly become a true "god" now
::'''Paimon:''' So we're too late?
::'''Paimon:''' The Balladeer has already... already become a god...?
::'''The Balladeer:''' "The Balladeer"
::'''The Balladeer:''' A long bygone title
::'''The Balladeer:''' When my spirit ascended to divinity
::'''The Balladeer:''' I felt as if I had existed for the same number of epochs as heaven and earth
::'''The Balladeer:''' Looking back
::'''The Balladeer:''' The existence of what once called itself "Kunikuzushi" appears infinitely small
::'''The Balladeer:''' And ugly

::'''Shouki no Kami, the Prodigal<br />Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom'''
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This imposing aura... It really feels like a god's...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' A body that capitalizes on The Balladeer's original construction as a mechanical puppet, with the Gnosis serving as a constant power supply...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' How much effort and resources did the sages put into this...?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' From a purely technological perspective, it's a commendable achievement indeed. It's no exaggeration to say this is the culmination of human wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure are something, dishing out compliments at a time like this...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But I don't think he's reached the spiritual height of a god.
:{{DIcon}} So he's still the same, old Balladeer on the inside.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' Strife is engraved upon every god and every Gnosis brought forth into this world.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' Can you feel it? The exhilaration of such power, and the thrill of anticipation for our contention...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida wouldn't feel the same things as you!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' Do you not realize... that you are interrupting a conversation between gods? Lowly creature, know your place!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' !!!
:{{DIcon}} Still the same Balladeer we know...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The strife engraved upon a Gnosis... You're talking about the Archon War.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Teyvat's current peace was not easily won. I didn't personally participate in the Archon War, but the way I see it...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' All those losses were meaningless, driven by the demands of the "laws." There's no point in bringing it up again.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' Hehehe, is that so? Yet I am deeply disappointed that I was never allowed the fortuity to personally participate in the Archon War.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 05.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' This is a first &mdash; encountering a god in this world who does not crave power.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 06.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' No wonder your own people have abandoned you, God of Wisdom.
:{{DIcon}} But from now on...
:{{DIcon}} Nahida's followers will only continue to increase in number.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 07.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' Hmph. Your judgment is as your existence: unsubstantial.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 08.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' This is where everything ends, Buer, the God of Wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 09.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' You should know that wisdom cannot solve every problem. Like now, where your only option is to face me in combat.
:'''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 10.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' Come...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 7 scaramouche 11.ogg}} '''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' Let us reenact a scene of the Archon War. Come and inaugurate my birth as a god.

{{Cutscene Description|Despite your best efforts, you are no match for Shouki no Kami. Seeing that you are losing, Nahida throws herself in front of you. Shouki no Kami's giant limb grabs Nahida, and The Balladeer, beneath his mechanical shell, reaches out to seize her Gnosis. As you look upon what seems like a destined defeat, you somehow feel a strong sense of déjà vu. Your surroundings start to collapse as Nahida uses her power. As it turns out, all your previous fights were in a samsara dream.<br />According to Nahida, this is the 168th loop. Now, she's sending you all the battle experience collected previously in the form of Canned Knowledge. Meanwhile, Nahida also sends everything that happened just now to the people of Sumeru in the form of knowledge and asks them to help you find a way to defeat this false god.<br />Now, all of Sumeru's wisdom is at your disposal. As the First Sage of the God of Wisdom Buer, you begin the true battle against Shouki no Kami.}}
::'''The Balladeer:''' This is supposed to be a battle between gods, yet you choose to hide behind a mortal

::'''Nahida:''' We just concluded the 168th loop

:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, this sure seems very different from what Paimon imagined... Shouldn't Irminsul be in this [[Realm of Consciousness|realm of consciousness]]?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, that is our destination, but I didn't expect the remaining consciousness of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata to be as polluted as this.
:{{DIcon}} Polluted?
::{{DIcon}} Surely not...
::{{DIcon}} It must be due to forbidden knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Forbidden knowledge? Hmm, it seems you know about a concept that even I don't completely understand. Could you tell me what you know?

:'''You tell Nahida all about what you had learned in the desert.'''

:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Your inference seems logical enough...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Forbidden knowledge once polluted the desert thousands of years ago, but was successfully repelled thanks to King Deshret's self-sacrifice and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata nearly exhausting her power.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Then a second instance of forbidden knowledge pollution occurred during the Khaenri'ah cataclysm five hundred years ago.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But I'm afraid it is much more serious this time, with Irminsul itself already in danger.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So if we're in the remaining consciousness of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and it's also been affected by forbidden knowledge pollution, then does that mean, in order to save us, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, it's very possible that she sacrificed her life in the fight against forbidden knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' She didn't completely eradicate forbidden knowledge, but if it weren't for her actions, the pollution would have been far more rampant over these past five hundred years.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The way that everyone, including me, has forgotten everything about forbidden knowledge may very well be due to her restoration of Irminsul.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, do you feel sad, Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm just sharing her pain... The pollution of her consciousness here is severe. There is madness, chaos, and pain all around us.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Did she fight to resist the forbidden knowledge pollution in such terrible conditions, all the way up till her last breath...?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' She even used her last remnant of lucid consciousness to leave a clue for us to follow...
:{{DIcon}} By "clue," you mean...
:{{DIcon}} The words, "...World... Forget me..."?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, her words were distorted by forbidden knowledge, so that's all we could hear.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But now we have a chance to find the answer to this mystery.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We can cross the polluted consciousness until we've found the right path to meet with her lucid consciousness.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' And then... we'll let Greater Lord Rukkhadevata tell us the truth in person.
:{{DIcon}} I hope we can use that truth to save everybody.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Each of us need to be mindful of the state of our own consciousness while we are here.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Even with the Gnosis' protection, we must always keep a clear mind. Otherwise, we could go mad at any moment.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eek! That's so scary!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 8 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Don't worry, it should be easy enough for you to keep that mind of yours clear, Paimon. Let's go.

;(Enter the cavern)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are we... in the air? And why is there a huge boat!?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 45.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's the Boat of Consciousness, which symbolizes reason here. Its course is the direction our consciousness is traveling towards.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 46.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If we lose control over our consciousness, we will fall into madness... So let's make sure the boat stays on course.

;(Approach the enemies)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... What are these? The monsters seem to have been affected by them...

;(Defeat the Riftwolves)

;(Defeat the enemies on the boat)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' To control the Boat of Consciousness, we need to find the helm first.

;(Start the wheel)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We changed direction. Are we still going the right way, Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Mm-hmm. Judging from the current route, the Boat of Consciousness will soon take us out of here.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We'll be arriving at our destination soon. How are you feeling? Are your minds still intact?
:{{DIcon}} Some strange thoughts came from time to time...
:{{DIcon}} But I seem to be okay now.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, but everything's been completely normal for Paimon.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hopefully, there won't be any more interruptions. This time, we should be able to meet Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you saying you've never met Greater Lord Rukkhadevata before?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No, it seems that my birth and her death took place at the same time.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Otherwise, I think she would have given me a little more guidance, and I could have done a better job.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you've done a great job, Nahida! Let's get out of this creepy place and go meet her!

;(At Irminsul)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So is this the place you were talking about...?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The base of Irminsul...

;(Continue forwards towards the tree)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Well, this is the place.
:{{DIcon}} Yes...
:{{DIcon}} It's the same place from my memories.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... we're here to find Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the one standing over there is...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Is that... me...? She looks exactly... like me...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Are you... Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 01.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Yes, that's me. Are you surprised by my appearance?
:{{DIcon}} I can't believe my eyes...
:{{DIcon}} The two of you look almost exactly the same...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 02.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Irminsul and the surrounding lands have been reproduced here as they were years ago, but this is just a realm of consciousness.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 03.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' We are manifestations of the same nature, hence why we would appear exactly the same.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm? We're... of the same nature? Why?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 04.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Because you are me, and I am you.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 05.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' You are me in the new samsara.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The new samsara...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 06.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' As Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, I'm the avatar of Irminsul, and you are the purest branch snapped from Irminsul.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 07.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Imagine it this way... Even if a tree dies, its branches will eventually take root and grow, continuing the tree's life in another form.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 08.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' I'm merely the remaining consciousness of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. The real me has presumably died a long time ago.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 09.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Hmm... Judging from your appearance, I've probably been dead for five hundred years...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 10.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' But you're finally here, my new "self" in this samsara.
:{{DIcon}} So this is the connection between you two...
:{{DIcon}} Lesser Lord Kusanali and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If this is true, then am I... going to be a great archon like you someday?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 11.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Though we share the same nature, our fates are bound to be different. All things have their own fate.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 12.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' When a branch grows into a mature tree, it won't be the same as the original tree.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's why fate is the ultimate knowledge, isn't it?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 13.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' That's a great insight. Yes, very good.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 14.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' It's also precisely why you won't become like me...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Really...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 15.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' But perhaps, you may become an even greater archon than I.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 16.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' I already see a determination in you that I didn't possess in my time, and the future that it leads you to will be yours alone.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 17.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Along with the blessings from your past experiences.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 18.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Don't worry. The growth of wisdom is like that of a plant &mdash; you only need to wait quietly for the flower to bloom.
:{{DIcon}} I have faith in Nahida, too...
:{{DIcon}} She will definitely become a great archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come to think of it, the sages never had the faintest inkling of the meaning of wisdom...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Thank you... Nothing makes me happier than discovering that the archon I always admired was in fact myself in another fate.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's so nice to speak with you, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. I've always wanted to meet you...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 19.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' The feeling is mutual. From the moment I snapped the branch off Irminsul and created you, I've also looked forward to talking with you.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Could you tell me... why you wanted to create me? And what exactly happened when you died...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 20.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Ah, I see. You're here seeking answers, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 21.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Everything that day, even the sky itself, changed into a color like this...
:;(The camera pans to a purple branch)
:{{DIcon}} I knew it... the Khaenri'ah cataclysm.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 22.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' At that time, The Seven were all summoned to the nation of Khaenri'ah, except for me. I had a more important task to attend to...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 23.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' I had to protect Irminsul.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 24.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' The disaster occurred together with the pollution of forbidden knowledge. At that very moment, with my consciousness connected to Irminsul, I sensed something was wrong.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 25.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' The pain started to torment my mind. By the time I reached Irminsul, it was already displaying signs of corruption.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 26.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Had I not repelled the pollution of forbidden knowledge with King Deshret thousands of years ago, I might have felt even more hopeless and lost.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So what exactly is... forbidden knowledge?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 27.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' It's a kind of knowledge that doesn't belong to this world, and a form of "truth" that can't be understood.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 28.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' It came from the very bottom of the Abyss. Even I could never understand it.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 29.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' The world is constantly rejecting it, leading to all kinds of bad phenomena.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 30.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' If we allow forbidden knowledge to pollute Irminsul, I'm afraid the entirety of Teyvat could fall apart.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So there's knowledge that even the God of Wisdom can't understand...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 31.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' At that time, I knew I couldn't repel the forbidden knowledge with my strength alone.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 32.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Which is why I created a device that compiled human wisdom, and named it "the Akasha."
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's truly the world's most amazing invention.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 33.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Hehe... Thank you. For a long time, I thought dreams were the fruit of human wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 34.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Though it was selfish to do so, I borrowed people's dreams using the Akasha. Then I compiled their wisdom and all of my own power...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, did it work?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 35.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Thanks to the wisdom of the people of Sumeru, almost all the forbidden knowledge was cleared from Irminsul.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 36.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' But... things didn't go as smoothly as I thought. I had a terrible headache, which gave me an uneasy feeling...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 37.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' And then, I remembered that my consciousness was also connected with Irminsul. It brought me knowledge and wisdom, but vile corruption as well.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 38.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' From the very beginning, my existence had been polluted by the forbidden knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... How could that happen...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I've experienced that pain in your consciousness. It must've been a horrible experience.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 39.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Yes, but my feelings weren't important. The important thing was that...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 40.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Even if I died, my existence and everything related to me would continue to exist in Irminsul as memories and knowledge, meaning that the forbidden knowledge couldn't ever be permanently eradicated.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 41.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' And... there's no way for me to eliminate myself. It would be a sort of paradox.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 42.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' So, I took the purest branch of Irminsul as my incarnation in the next samsara, and left a trail of clues...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 43.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' All in hopes that you would come here and remove me and my pollution from Irminsul forever.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...W&mdash;Wait. No... I can't!
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 44.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Hehe, so you realized what that implies? You are very smart, indeed.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 45.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Irminsul has all the knowledge and memories of this world. And as you've realized just now...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 46.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' Removing me from Irminsul means... I essentially will never have existed in this world.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 rukkhadevata 47.ogg}} '''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' But... this is the only way to save Irminsul.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' People love you so much and... and they've missed you so much over the past five hundred years. I... I am exactly the same. So how...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' How can we just... forget you like this?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 10 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Is there really no other way? There must be something else I can do!

:{{DIcon}} Nahida?
:{{DIcon}} ...Are you alright?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Ah, (Traveler), I&mdash;I'm all right. I'm just a little confused...
:{{DIcon}} What are you confused about?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We've just saved the world, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So why... why am I crying?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Don't tell me...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I don't know where this feeling inside of me is coming from, but I feel very sad...
:{{DIcon}} Do you still remember... what happened just now?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Just now? We used the power of two Gnoses to successfully connect with the Irminsul consciousness from five hundred years ago...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Then, we removed the remaining pollution from Irminsul...
:{{DIcon}} (She's forgotten her...)
:{{DIcon}} (Did I manage to remember because I'm not from this world?)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, what's wrong? (Traveler), weren't you there just now?
:'''(Traveler):''' (Paimon doesn't seem to remember either. Has everybody really forgotten Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Should I... tell them the truth?)
:'''???:''' *Buzzing*
:'''(Traveler):''' (What's that sound...? I feel... super... sleepy...)
:;(The Traveler and Paimon fall unconscious)
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Huh, that sound... (Traveler)? Paimon?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 01.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' I've been waiting here far too long... But finally, I have the chance to be alone with you. All the precious time I wasted has finally paid off.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Doctor... What have you done!?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 02.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Just a type of sound wave that can quickly put defenseless people into a dream. As I expected... it doesn't have any effect on gods.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 03.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' This is the only thing of interest I found among the sages' research. I thought I'd take it for a little spin.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 04a.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Don't worry. I know you would never forgive me if I actually killed them.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 05.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' I'm here to negotiate with you. Naturally, I won't do anything dangerous that could potentially damage our relationship.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Negotiate with me? I heard you had already left Sumeru. Why are you here again now?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 06.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' "I" left Sumeru, but "I" also stayed in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 07.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Even the God of Wisdom is restricted by the habits of cognition. How disappointing.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You mean... there are many different versions of you in this world?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 08.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' An astute guess.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 09.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Even the same individual will have different cognitions at different ages.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 10.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' A long time ago, I made a major decision in hopes of preserving all my perspectives of how I observed the world.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 11.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Observation is the first step of any experiment, but observing the current world doesn't satisfy me. It lacks an important dimension &mdash; that of time.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 12.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' So I saved "segments" of all my ages, and made them into independent individuals...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 13.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' That's all there is to it. Indulge me, how does the God of Wisdom find my method of seeking knowledge?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's an insult to the very concept of life.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Life inherently has many rules and restrictions, each with its own significance and reason to exist. They can't be broken on a whim.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 14.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Hehehehe... Good. Amazing, even.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 15.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Indeed. It's difficult for humans... to make peace with themselves, not to mention oneself from a different period.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Since you were in the Akademiya, why wait until now to show up? You could very well have stopped us and helped that "fake god."
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 16.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Simple, let me ask you this: Would any staff member ever help the subject in the middle of an experiment?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 17.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' It was my experiment, so why should I interfere with the results?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...The Akademiya saw the plan to create a god as their ultimate goal, yet you only saw it as an ordinary experiment...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Y&mdash;You really are crazy... If the experiment succeeded, you would have had a new god on your hands. How would you have faced your own god then?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Would you still take the same stance? Would you still hold the same view of yourself?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 18.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' I'm first and foremost a scholar. These results should be left to the judgment of the hypothetical "me" confronted with that outcome. But you're right, and that's exactly why I'm disappointed with the conclusion of this experiment.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As an individual, you don't have any sense of belonging... And you seem to have even fewer convictions than a typical scholar.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 19.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Oh, no. I certainly have my own convictions. They just don't fit your standards, that's all.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 20.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' All right, that's enough conversation for today. The experiment is over and it's time to tidy up the equipment and reclaim any useful materials.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 21.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' For example... the Gnosis.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 22.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Lesser Lord Kusanali, you're an intelligent archon. I'm sure you understand the disparity in our combat abilities at this time... Besides, you have no way to use that Electro Gnosis in battle.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Didn't you say you were here to negotiate with me? Somehow it's starting to seem like you intend to take it by force now.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 23.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Hahaha... I'm merely stating a fact.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 24.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' After all, I'm also a scholar. Naturally, I hope to show proper respect and dignity to the God of Wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Your hypocrisy is built on absolute confidence.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I understand your scheme, but...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...What if I were to destroy the Gnosis now, and awaken the Heavenly Principles?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 25.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Awaken... the heavenly principles?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 26.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 27.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Do you think that's really possible?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 24.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Heavenly Principles have been silent for many years, but the Gnoses are symbols of their control over Teyvat and all the laws...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 25.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Will the destruction of a Gnosis attract the attention of the Heavenly Principles? And if so... how do the Fatui plan to deal with the consequences?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 26.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Do you dare... to gamble such a possibility with me?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 28.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Hmph, "gamble"? How surprising.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 29.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' I thought you would show evidence or use rigorous reasoning to prove your point... The word "gamble" is the last thing I expected to hear from the God of Wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 30.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' But this is a clever move. You must have seen through me when I first captured your consciousness.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 31.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' As a scholar, I respect all possibilities. This has always been my principle and is an essential trait as an experimenter.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 32.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Indeed, I can't ignore this possibility. So tell me then, what are your conditions?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 27.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This foreign Gnosis will only lead to disaster if it stays in Sumeru...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 28.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But this Electro Gnosis is the prize I obtained after defeating one of your fellow Harbingers.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 29.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Now, as the one who initiated this cascade of events, shouldn't you pay the corresponding price?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 33.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Price? Interesting. What price would you have me pay?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 30.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...How about erasing all your other segments?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 34.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Hahaha... So this is how you wish to restrict me, the most threatening opponent of the Nation of Wisdom. What you request of me is like plucking out the eyes I have placed in the dimension of time.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 61.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Segments are extraordinarily difficult to make. They require extremely rare resources and enormous amounts of time and effort. Requiring me to destroy them all here and now... Bravo, a suitably wise decision on your part.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 35.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Yes, how very interesting... Can I assume that you have long been wary of me?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 36.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Among all the versions of me, this segment you see now is the most selfish. If it weren't me, your idea wouldn't have worked.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 37.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' What did you see when you were imprisoned? You were observing me, and that's how you know I've long grown tired of their doubts and endless arguments.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 31.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Like you said, it's difficult to make peace with yourself.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 32.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Being as smart as you are, have you managed to do that?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 38.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 39.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' I see. If you think all those versions of me are worth a Gnosis... Then, deal.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 33.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You sure didn't hesitate much. Is the relationship between all the versions of you really that bad?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 40.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' I don't think there's any need to dwell on that. The surplus versions of me can be exchanged for a Gnosis. Do you think anyone can offer themselves at a higher price?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 41.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Besides, with my abilities, it's only a matter of time until I find better "perspectives." Perhaps it's best to say... you're just temporarily ahead.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 42.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' But what I'd like to know is, how can you be sure that I've really erased them?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 34.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I can see your remaining honesty...
:'''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 43.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' ...Hmph.

:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 36.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The future of Sumeru City will be in my hands alone. I will shut down the Akasha and let curiosity and the thirst for knowledge drive the realm of academics once again...

:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 52.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' It truly pains me that my academic achievements have never been appreciated in my homeland. Of course, I have no interest in being rejected by this city for a third time.

:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 54.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' No, this is a different transaction. If you intend to turn off the Akasha anyway, then there's no further use for the Gnosis of Sumeru, is there?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 55.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Besides, isn't it the archon's duty to deliver what's desired of the seeker?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 56.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Oh? Judging from your expression, you don't seem to find the idea very agreeable. Then let's think of it this way... Since you're the God of Wisdom, how about I exchange some knowledge with you?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 39.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' People exchanging knowledge with the God of Wisdom is the stuff of legends, yet here you wish to exchange knowledge for the God of Wisdom's property...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 40.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Arrogant as that is, it has piqued my interest.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 57.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Let me ask you... Have you in all your mighty knowledge ever heard the rumor that "the skies of Teyvat are fake"?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 nahida 41.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 58.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' That's the secret hidden by Irminsul concerning the "truth" of this world...
:'''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 59.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Once I finish telling you about this, it will be time for me to say goodbye.
:{{A|vo xmaq304 11 dottore 60.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' With negotiations, we've all gotten what we wanted. I'm very glad I got to meet you like this.
