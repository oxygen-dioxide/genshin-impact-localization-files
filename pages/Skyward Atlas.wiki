==Description==
An atlas of wind.<br />
A copy of the atlas pertaining to the weather of the northern regions, presented in the form of poems and images.<br />
It consists of 100,000 odes, each dedicated to a single cloud or wind and calling it by name.<br />
The cloud atlas gave form to the winds, and odes infused them with personality.<br />
The myriad formless winds are now friends and family in the eyes of [[Barbatos]].

Legends tell that in ancient times, Barbatos summoned the [[Four Winds|four winds]] with the original version.<br />
He thawed the snow, drove away vicious beasts, summoned rainfall, and created [[Mondstadt]].<br />
He permitted the atlas to be shared and copied among the people, giving it the name of Cloud Atlas.<br />
Sadly, nothing survives the test of time. Certain drawings and odes were missing in the copies that survived.<br />
However, the knowledge passed on in the form of ballads and legends among the general public.

The histories of the [[Thousand Winds|thousand winds]] were not lost, for Barbatos still holds them.<br />
When Barbatos stood against the shadowy wings of the evil dragon Durin,<br />
He sang to the thousand winds and called upon the [[Dvalin|Wind Dragon]].<br />
He who holds this atlas wields the true names of the thousand winds and all of their powers.

Now the skies above Mondstadt are calm and blue.<br />
Barbatos and Dvalin have found a new place to call home.<br />
The atlas, meanwhile, has been entrusted to one worthy of the honor.
