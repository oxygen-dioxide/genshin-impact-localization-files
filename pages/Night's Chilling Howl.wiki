'''Night's Chilling Howl''' is [[Wriothesley]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Wriothesley wears a dark grey coat with a crimson lining, rhomboid silver buttons, and dark fur trim around the collar; a grey double-breasted vest with a darker grey button-up shirt beneath and a loose red necktie; grey pants with handcuffs hanging from his belt; and tall black boots. His arms and neck are haphazardly bound in black bandages. He has multiple silver stud and cuff earrings in his ears asymmetrically; silver rings on each finger; a spiked silver necktie ornament; and a large silver brooch shaped like a side profile of a wolf with draping chains, with a matching silver ornament on his left hand. His {{Ousia}}-aligned {{Cryo}} [[Vision]] hangs upon the back of his coat.
