[[Version 2.2]]
*Uncle Tian referring to Ganyu as "little Miss Ganyu" was revised to "Lady Ganyu" and the surrounding dialogue was revised:
**{{Color|Old:}} Why, isn't it... Little Miss Ganyu?<br />{{Color|New:}} Is that... It is! It's Lady Ganyu!
**{{Color|Old:}} Thâ€”This old man called her "little Miss Ganyu"!<br />{{Color|New:}} "Lady Ganyu"? Why are you calling her that?
**{{Color|Old:}} Hahahaha... Ah, little Miss Ganyu. Your kind words make me feel that my decades of hard work haven't been in vain.<br />{{Color|New:}} Hahahaha... Ah, what an honor to receive such high praise from Lady Ganyu herself! I guess I must have done something right over the last... however many decades.
**{{Color|Old:}} Uncle Tian, please... A person of your standing should really stop calling me "Lady Ganyu"...<br />{{Color|New:}} Uncle Tian, please... A person of your standing should really stop calling me "little Miss Ganyu"...
**{{Color|Old:}} Uh, my apologies. It's not intentional, just a childhood habit of mine.<br />{{Color|New:}} Uh, my apologies. It's not intentional, just a habit from my younger days.
