:The wheel of fate points in eleven directions.

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Fatui.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Fatui]]'''<br>The "Palestar Edict," that highest of commands, has gone out. With it, the Fatui [[Harbingers]] have been summoned back to Snezhnaya and dispatched to Nod-Krai. The people stare and wonder: for what purpose does this army, bearing the banner of the Pale Star, come to their city? Or perhaps the question should be, "For whom?"

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Frostmoon Scions.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Frostmoon Scions]]'''<br>The descendants of the legendary golden realm, who chose to find new homes among the mountains and forests after abandoning their ancient civilization. The only thing they never forsook was their faith in the "Moon Goddess." However, with the arrival of the Fatui, it appears that their tranquil lives are about to fade into the realm of yesterday...

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Lightkeepers.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Lightkeepers]]'''<br>The ancient organization that has long defended Nod-Krai's freedom and peace against the ceaseless incursions and Wild Hunt attacks launched by the Abyss, now severely weakened from battles past. In the face of new threats, none can say for sure if the new generation of Ratniki will remain able to carry out their mission...

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Hexenzirkel.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Hexenzirkel]]'''<br>Located at the "edge" of the world, Nod-Krai has always been the stage where conflicts and dramas unfold, one after another — how could the Hexenzirkel possibly miss out on this golden opportunity?

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon The Wild Hunt.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[The Wild Hunt]]'''<br>The armies of the [[Abyss]] sweep across the wilderness and canyons like a storm, and if you venture close enough, you may even hear their eerie whispers. These lost, soulless monsters appear to be silently searching for something...

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Knights of Favonius.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Knights of Favonius]]'''<br>A small group of elite knights from the [[Mondstadt]] expeditionary force has followed their [[Varka|Grand Master]] across Snezhnaya, arriving in Nod-Krai. It is said that they have come on a crucial mission...

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Voynich Guild.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Voynich Guild]]'''<br>The merchants of [[Nasha Town]] formed a commerce guild to maintain basic order. However, how could the outlaws that prowl between the islands be controlled by something as simple as mere rules? It seems that the honor of striking fear into their hearts must go to the boss lady of the "Curatorium of Secrets"...

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Treasure Hoarders.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Treasure Hoarders]]'''<br>The Treasure Hoarders have since spread throughout the rest of Teyvat, but their origin in Nod-Krai remains a little-known fact. The "great treasure" left behind by [[Reed Miller]], the legendary thief who yearned to create "a world without boundaries," is said to be buried somewhere here...

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Snowland Fae.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Snowland Fae]]'''<br>The fae who once followed the first {{Cryo}} [[Archon]], the [[Belyi Tsar]], ruling the Northlands in their entirety. Though now shorn of their former glory, they still influence the nation in their own ways. One can only guess what path they will take as calamity draws ever closer...

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Adventurers' Guild.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Adventurers' Guild]]'''<br>Ad astra abyssosque! The Guild's strong presence in an adventurer's paradise like Nod-Krai is only natural. A certain "important figure" from the Guild's headquarters is preparing to welcome you as a sign of respect...

:[[File:Song of the Welkin Moon Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop.png|30px|class=lightmode-drop-shadow]] '''[[Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop]]'''<br>It began as a small workshop that a certain prodigy used to research the "World's Best Krumkake Machine." But over time, after the creation of many intricate inventions, it gained a new identity as a famous machine workshop. Be sure to mind your manners when begging that genius for a favor, though, or whatever component she gives you might be liable to cough out a nasty krumkake at any time!
