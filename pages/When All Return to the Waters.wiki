# Go to the place [[Melus]] mentioned
# Find the entrance to the "headquarters"
# Proceed deeper within to investigate
#* The player will be teleported into the Quest Domain [[Aquanigma]].
# Look for clues in the headquarters' depths
# Analyze the clues you've found with [[Paimon]]
# Look for clues related to "Vacher"
# Race back to the [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]] and submit the evidence
# Leave the opera house

==Gameplay Notes==
* During step 5, the active party is limited to the Traveler.
* Completing step 8 grants the {{Achievement|Tragedy Repeats Itself}}.
* Step 10 will be blocked by the World Quest [[The Long-Failed "Graph Adversarial Technology"...]]
* Upon completing this quest, if the player stands within the [[Fountain of Lucine]], they can hear [[Furina]]'s sobbing voice saying "So interminable... So lonely... Just... how much longer?" This foreshadows a scene in {{Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}. After that quest is completed, her voice can no longer be heard at the fountain.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Your investigations did not bear much fruit, but a new suspect has been hauled up for trial at the opera house. You and Navia must split up and do your best to uncover the truth...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After being teleported to the area)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that Navia has set out for [[Erinnyes]], we should also get going!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The location has already been marked on the map, so let's head over.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' According to Melus' info, the [[Sinthe]] production base is underwater...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go and try to find the entrance!

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Finally found it... So this is the entrance that leads to the Sinthe production base... It sure doesn't seem out of the ordinary at all...
:{{DIcon}} Well, they don't want it to stand out.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, but I'm sure what we find inside will be "extraordinary."
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, you're right... An important place like this is bound to have a ton of protective measures and mechanisms.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Navia's probably arguing up a storm right now to stall for us...
:{{Black Screen|Meanwhile, inside the Opera Epiclese...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It would appear that I must repeat my question again, Mr. [[Tartaglia]].
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Do you accept the charge that you are the true culprit behind the serial disappearances case?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 01.ogg}} '''Childe:''' To be perfectly honest, I don't understand your country's complicated court system, or the reason why I'm being charged with something I've never even heard of.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 02.ogg}} '''Childe:''' However, I did hear that people who have been charged can choose to participate in a duel to clear their name. Is that right?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 03.ogg}} '''Childe:''' In which case, as long as I accept the charge, I can have an all-out fight with that [[Champion Duelist]] [[Clorinde]], right?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 04.ogg}} '''Childe:''' I've gotta admit, that's one of the most enticing offers I've ever received.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 05.ogg}} '''Childe:''' When I privately sparred with her last time, she was obviously holding back... Real disappointing.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, don't you understand? You're currently the prime suspect for a major case! This isn't the place for you to be looking for fights.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 06.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Ooh? Sounds like the Hydro Archon wants to lecture me on the ways of the opera house...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 07.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Then why don't you duel me, too? I'm the kind of student that learns best in the heat of battle.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' A&mdash;Ah, no no no, that's not what I meant...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Alas, it would appear that communication with the defendant is going poorly, and we have made very little progress.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In that case, let me explain everything from the very beginning again. The goal of this trial is to determine the culprit behind the serial disappearances case...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That case had nothing to do with him! You've got the wrong man!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 audienceh 01.ogg}} '''Surprised Audience Member:''' Huh!? What's going on?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 audiencei 01.ogg}} '''Doubtful Audience Member:''' Why is she interjecting again?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 audiencek 01.ogg}} '''Confident Audience Member:''' Hah, I told you it couldn't be one of the [[Fatui Harbingers]]!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Miss Navia, this is the second time you've interrupted the court proceedings. I only tolerated your behavior last time because you were able to provide the court with a key eyewitness.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But that was an exception rather than standard court protocol. I can very well charge you with contempt of court for your interjections.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Please, did you ever think I had any respect for this place's pointless theatrics?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We can put that discussion aside for now, I'm not here to argue with you. I'm here to charge the true culprit behind the serial disappearances case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And if my charges prove true, then Tartaglia here will be proven innocent by default, correct?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 08.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Oh? A young lady has charged in and offered to clear my name, how fascinating. Well, I'd gotten half bored to death by all these rules and procedures anyway, so I'll take you up on that offer.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 tartaglia 09.ogg}} '''Childe:''' So, Your Honor, is there nothing else for me to do now?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You may take a seat for now in the audience, but that doesn't mean the suspicions against you have been lifted.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Now then, Miss Navia, who is the person you would like to charge instead?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That person is...

;(Select the incorrect evidence)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (Something's not right... Let me think for a little while longer.)

;(Select "Information Regarding Marcel" or "Suspect Analysis")
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Marcel, the head of [[Confrerie of Cabriere]]!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 audienceh 02.ogg}} '''Confused Audience Member:''' Huh? What confrerie? Never heard of them in my life.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 audiencek 02.ogg}} '''Thinking Audience Member:''' I've heard of them, but... weren't they Spina di Rosula's sister organization?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 audiencej 01.ogg}} '''Ecstatic Audience Member:''' Ooh! Is this going to be friends-to-enemies type situation!?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please let me remind you, Miss Navia, that charging someone is an incredibly serious matter. Committing to the charge also means taking on the legal responsibilities associated with it.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And if the charge fails, depending on the circumstances, you may also be charged with the crime of making a false accusation. Knowing this, do you still wish to charge this man?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yes, I do.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In that case, I declare the charge to be valid. Miss Navia and attorneys, please take your places on the court.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Members of the [[Garde]]s, please contact Mr. Marcel right away so that he may stand trial.
:{{Black Screen|After some time, a shocked and confused Marcel is brought to the stands.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Mr. Marcel, you will not require an attorney, is that correct?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 marcelle 01.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' Ah... Apologies, it all just happened so quickly, I still haven't figured out what's going on.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 marcelle 02.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' I think an attorney won't be necessary. This is probably just a misunderstanding between me and Navia.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Very well. In that case, since both sides have now arrived, Miss Navia, please present your charges.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I would like to take everyone back to three years ago, to the case of "[[Callas]] the Unfaithful."
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Only through elucidating what really happened in that case can we connect all the dots for the serial disappearances case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 marcelle 03.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' Navia, do you really think I was the one who killed your father?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 marcelle 04.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' Come on, why would I do that? Callas was my benefactor, and remember, both you and I only ran to the scene when we heard the sound of a gun.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 marcelle 05.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' If that's enough to make me a suspect, wouldn't that make everyone at that banquet a suspect as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I, uh... I think there's no point in getting into the specifics right now. The audience doesn't even have the big picture yet. Even I'm... ahem, struggling to remember some details of that case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Exactly correct, Your Honor. I must refresh everyone's memory about that case before I can explain my charge and reasoning.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I see. In which case, I will recount the findings about that case as originally recorded by [[Maison Gardiennage]].
:;(A Refutation begins)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' On the day of the murder, [[Spina di Rosula]] hosted a large banquet in a countryside estate owned by the Confrerie of Cabriere.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' During the banquet, all attending guests heard two gunshots from the courtyard.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' When the guests arrived at the scene, they found the primary suspect, Callas, holding a gun, while his acquaintance, [[Jacques]], lay dead from a gunshot wound.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The Gardes' investigation did not recover any other firearms from the scene. As a result, they concluded that the suspect's first shot must have missed, while the second must have taken Jacques' life.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 20.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The suspect did not dispute this conclusion, and also declined to defend himself in court. Instead, he chose to prove his innocence through a duel.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 21.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Callas was defeated by Champion Duelist Clorinde in the ensuing duel, and soon succumbed to the injuries.
:[[File:When All Return to the Waters Cycle of Refutation 1.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 neuvillette 22.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' These are the known facts about the case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (The one with the motive to kill was Jacques, not my father, and even so, Jacques still had no reason to pull the trigger.)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (In truth, the third person shot Jacques first, and was shot in turn by my father when my father seized the gun from him.)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (After that, the true culprit turned the third person into water, erasing all traces of him from the scene.)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thank you for the summary, Your Honor. Of course, the Gardes' conclusion appeared quite sensible to us at the time.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' However, we should revisit the case now that we've gained new information about the abilities of Water from the [[Primordial Sea]].

;(Refute with the wrong evidence)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (Something's not right... Let me think for a little while longer.)

;(Refute "Two Gunshots" with "Testimony from Jacques' Family")
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The testimony of the victim's family confirms that Jacques had thoughts of assassinating Callas when he set out for the banquet.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' However, in the end he reconsidered, and instead shared everything with Callas, hoping to seek the latter's protection.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Unfortunately for Jacques, the true culprit had already considered this possibility, and had sent out another assassin.
:;(The scales of the Oratrice tip towards the right)

;(Refute "The Scene of the Crime" with "Callas' Case Records")
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' This assassin first shot Jacques, then turned to shoot Callas, only for Callas to wrestle the gun from him and kill him instead.

;(Refute "Reconstruction of the Events" with "Primordial Seawater")
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' A pile of clothing was found at the scene. The Gardes once believed they were used by Jacques as a costume to disguise himself...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But now, it is clear that the clothes were proof that there was a third person at the scene, and that they were turned into water after committing the murder.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Since it was raining that day, the culprit was confident that they could use the rain to wash away all traces of their dissolved accomplice.

;(After finding all loopholes)
:[[File:When All Return to the Waters Cycle of Refutation 2.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq006 1 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Realizing this, the true culprit caused the hired assassin to dissolve into water, leading everyone to believe Callas was responsible for Jacques' murder. This is the true version of events.
:;(Refutation ends and the scales tip farther to the right)

;(After the refutation)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 audiencei 01.ogg}} '''Canny Audience Member:''' Ah, so that's what happened...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 audienceh 01.ogg}} '''Surprised Audience Member:''' Wait, you're telling me something as dangerous as Water from the Primordial Sea has been used for all these years?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 01.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' What a great theory. It also explains Callas' and Jacques' respective motives... I guess they didn't shoot each other after all.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Mr. Marcel, you are the one being charged with a crime. You should provide a rebuttal if you wish to prove your innocence.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 02.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' But I think I agree with everything Navia just said. In fact, there was nothing in her speech that directly implicated me...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Th&mdash;Then, may I ask some questions? In my opinion, we primarily need to determine two things...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' One, do you have the evidence to back up your claims?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'm afraid not &mdash; at least, not at this very moment.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 audiencej 01.ogg}} '''Scornful Audience Member:''' Boo! Hahaha, if you don't have any evidence, you should just go home!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I may not have the evidence with me, but I know where I could go to collect it. If we look up the deserted clothes against a record of people who went missing at around the same time...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We should be able to find a match.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Considering the serial disappearances case, the Gardes probably kept careful records of all missing persons from around that time, regardless of age or gender.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' That makes sense to me... Monsieur Neuvillette, I would consider this to be a reasonable investigative direction.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Why do I feel like Furina's acting a little differently today?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' Maybe she's scared of embarrassing herself again?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Alternatively, she's become more diligent after charging an innocent citizen in the last trial.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' My second question has to do with the ensuing duel. If the truth is indeed as you described...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Then why didn't Mr. Callas explain himself in court? If he had testified that a person had been dissolved, he could have at least mounted a defense.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I've thought about this too, and the answer is actually pretty simple &mdash; he felt there were things that were more important to him.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The dissolving power of Water from the Primordial Sea is an important secret for the true culprit of the serial disappearances case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' My father could have exposed it for all to see, but he chose to take it to the grave.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' At that time, Spina di Rosula was in dire straits, and his reputation had already been shattered. He had no guarantee that going forward with the truth would allow the culprit to be brought to justice.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What was certain, however, was that it would paint a gigantic target on my back.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcillac 02.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Boss once told me that Demoiselle had already been selected as the next target of the serial disappearances case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What!?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If the secret had gotten out, the culprit would have fought an all-out war with the Spina right there and then. I wouldn't have been the only one in danger &mdash; all of us would have stood to lose our lives.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Of course, the Gardes might eventually figure out the truth of the matter, and determine that we were in the right...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But what good would that do? How can a hollow verdict protect anyone?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Had this opera house ever given my father any kind of confidence in its brand of justice, Spina di Rosula would have had no reason to exist!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But by staying silent, we retained the ability to deter our opponents, and continue the stalemate.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I was also able to become Spina di Rosula's president, which made me harder to target, as well as giving me more time to grow and learn.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And once I have figured out the truth and stepped up to the challenge, I will do what this opera house cannot, and restore my father's truth and honor back to him!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So... You mean to say... Your father intended to die in the Duelists' Ring?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Do you have any proof?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Of course.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' All you need is to ask his opponent, Clorinde.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I don't need your apology, your guilt, or your support from the shadows. You don't have to do anything for my sake.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But since he entrusted his will to you, Clorinde, you should tell us the truth about his sacrifice.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Erm... So... During the duel, did you believe that Callas was intending to die?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Yes, I did.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' As a Champion Duelist, I've fought many battles, and taken a countless number of dishonored lives.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' In my line of work, I've seen all kinds of people give their all for the faintest hope to continue living. Some were determined, others passionate, and some even manic and twisted.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Just one look and I can tell if a duelist is hoping to live, or if they're looking to die.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I hereby swear on my name and honor as a Champion Duelist that Mr. Callas never intended to leave the Ring alive.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Since that's your testimony, I have no more questions. It appears there really are good grounds to reopen this case...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I concur. However, Miss Navia, you still have not explained the link between your father's case and the serial disappearances case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 audiencek 01.ogg}} '''Approving Audience Member:''' Right? What she said was fascinating, but kind of beside the point...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 audienceh 02.ogg}} '''Astonished Audience Member:''' Wait, weren't they just talking about the serial disappearances case!?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Of course, Your Honor. The two cases are connected via a matter of timing.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In my father's case, the culprit intended to kill both Jacques and Callas. As a result, they planned to act after hearing two gunshots.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 26.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And at the end of Lyney's trial, the culprit also only dissolved the victim in front of everyone because they realized they were at risk of being identified.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 27.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The culprit could only time their actions so precisely if they were already at the scene.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 28.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Coincidentally, Marcel attended both the banquet and the trial.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 03.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' So that's why you suspected me... *sigh* Even after hearing your reasoning, I still can't help but find it a little preposterous.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 04.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' I'm used to it, though. You've always been an impulsive and sentimental child, Navia. It's one of your most endearing traits.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 silver 02.ogg}} '''Silver:''' No need to appeal to pathos.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 05.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' I won't try to refute your points one by one, but even if everything you just said was true, can you prove that I was the only person present at both events?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 06.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' On top of that, does a person have to be physically present to control the timing? Can't someone remotely monitor the place?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 29.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ah...
:;(The scales, which were heavily tipped towards Navia, shift a bit towards Marcel)

:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 07.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' I know that even with that, you might still think you can reduce the list of suspects with some further investigations, until I'm the only one left on the list.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 08.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' Alas, who won't feel at least a little hurt by an accusation of murder from a girl you see as your own daughter?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 09.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' But if I were to dismiss this completely, you'd also think I'm not being considerate of your feelings. Ah well, let Uncle Marcel teach you another lesson.

:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 11.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' It's "timing," again.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 12.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' I'm a businessman by trade. From that standpoint, there's no reason for me to kidnap young women. It's a high-risk action with nothing to gain.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 13.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' In addition, I left my home in [[Snezhnaya]] when I was young to come to [[Poisson]] and work in some trade. My business only thrived when I received Callas' patronage.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 14.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' But the disappearances began before I ever stepped foot in Fontaine.

:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 15.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' Is there anything else you'd like to say? Would you like to check the date of my first business license against the first known case of the serial disappearances?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 16.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' You can also take a look at my border entry records, or ask my friends and family when I left Snezhnaya for the first time.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 17.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' Could those records and testimonies do something to appease the unspeakable anguish in your heart?

:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 20.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' He wished for you to become more rational, collected, and conscientious, instead of dwelling only on your own feelings.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 21.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' Once you've learned to be more considerate of others' feelings, and to stop rushing headlong into things, you'd have met most of his expectations.

:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 34.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The biggest difference between me and the rest of the victims is that I still have the ability to search for the truth, while that same agency has long been taken from them.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 35.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The people whose families were destroyed by Sinthe abuse, the people who lost their loved ones to the serial disappearances, and the people who suffered tragic ends due to their sense of justice...

:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 37.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And whose image do you see, Marcel?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 38.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Is it a man named "Vacher"?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 marcelle 22.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' ...!?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 2 navia 39.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh? So you do know that name.

:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Vacher learned of the Primordial Water's existence through the work of others, and began to kidnap young women for research, with the goal of discovering a method to restore Vigneire back to life.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' To cover his tracks, he invented the new alias of "Marcel," and began to operate a business in Poisson.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' During the course of his research, Vacher discovered that a diluted concoction of Water from the Primordial Sea can induce feelings of euphoria, and began to manufacture and market "Sinthe."
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, as he accumulated wealth to fund his continued research and expanded the scope, he came into conflict with Spina di Rosula.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' After exchanging blows with Spina di Rosula for many years, Vacher decided to assassinate their president, Callas, at a banquet.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Although the assassination did not go as Vacher expected, he was able to turn Callas into the murder suspect by dissolving the assassin he sent to the scene.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And just recently, Vacher attempted to frame Lyney as the culprit of the serial disappearances case using a similar method.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, his attempt to frame Lyney failed, and the power of Water from the Primordial Sea became public knowledge. This case also exposed enough of Vacher's machinations that he was eventually successfully charged in court.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thus concludes the enigmatic history of the serial disappearances case, with the truth revealed to all.
:'''Audience:''' (Applause)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The Oratrice will now deliver the final verdict regarding the charges against Mr. Vacher.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' According to the judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, Mr. Vacher is&mdash;
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' &mdash;Guilty.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 marcelle 21.ogg}} '''Marcel:''' ...

:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 audiencel 01.ogg}} '''Eager Audience Member:''' With that, the serial disappearances case is over now...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 audienceh 01.ogg}} '''Emotional Audience Member:''' We really just witnessed history... Who would have thought the true culprit would be such a polite and well-spoken guy...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yippee!!! We helped Navia bring the bad guy to justice!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's hurt so many innocent people, now he's finally getting what he deserves.

:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yeah... Yeah. It's finally over. It's all thanks to you guys, and my partner.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' See, Papa? Spina di Rosula's still doing well with me at the helm...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 tartaglia 02.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Well now, hasn't this been a most delicious piece of drama? The villain has been caught, justice has been served, past wrongs have been righted, and it's a big ol' happy ending...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 tartaglia 03.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Since it's been such a great show, I'll just let the false accusations against me slide. Either way, I've still got some business to attend to, so if you'll excuse me...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 20.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please wait just one moment, Mr. Tartaglia.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 tartaglia 04.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Oh, what now? None of this has anything to do with me.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 21.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' According to court protocol, since this trial was initiated due to a charge against you, a verdict must also be made regarding the initial charge before the trial can conclude.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 tartaglia 05.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Ah c'mon, is this really necessary? Haven't you already caught the real criminal? Isn't it time for side characters like me to exit stage left?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 22.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please respect the laws of Fontaine. This has always been the rule.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 tartaglia 06.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Alright, alright, but this sure is a lot of hassle. All I need to do is to stand over there, right? Let's just get this over with.
:;(Tartaglia takes the stand)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 23.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...Through evidence presented in the public trial that was just held, it has been established that Mr. Tartaglia has no direct connection to the serial disappearances case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 24.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The guilty party has been identified, and thus, it is logical to suppose Mr. Tartaglia is innocent of the charges.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 25.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' We now turn to the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] to render the final verdict on the charges.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 26.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 27.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' According to the judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, Mr. Tartaglia is&mdash;
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 28.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...Guilty.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 tartaglia 07.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Hey, hey! That's not funny... Didn't you just say I'm supposed to be innocent?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 tartaglia 08.ogg}} '''Childe:''' What's with this verdict? Is your justice machine malfunctioning?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 audienceh 02.ogg}} '''Confident Audience Member:''' Huh!? This has never happened before, the Oratrice... actually returned a different verdict from the Chief Justice...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 audiencek 01.ogg}} '''Contemplative Audience Member:''' I mean, have you ever heard of an innocent Fatui Harbinger? Do you think the Oratrice might have just convicted him on general principle?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 audiencei 01.ogg}} '''Doubtful Audience Member:''' But weren't the charges about the serial disappearances case? No matter what else he's guilty of, it shouldn't affect the verdict in this case, right?
:{{DIcon}} Childe has been declared guilty by the Oratrice...
:{{DIcon}} Just what is going on here?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 29.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale is, by law, the final verdict of the court. We must accept the guilty verdict.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 8 neuvillette 30.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Gardes, please take the suspect into custody per court protocol.

:;(As the dust clears, Childe is revealed to be subdued by Neuvillette)
::'''Neuvillette:''' I am sorry
::'''Neuvillette:''' If you have been wronged, we will find the truth
::'''Neuvillette:''' But the rules of the court
::'''Neuvillette:''' Must be upheld

:;(He wipes blood off his face and continues to walk off stage)
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Monsieur Neuvillette, what's going on? Shouldn't he have been cleared already?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Apologies, this is also the first time I've encountered such a situation. However, according to the rules established at the conception of Fontaine's court system, the Oratrice's judgment is the final verdict of the court.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' All I do is follow court procedure. As for why the Oratrice arrived at the conclusion it did, you should probably ask someone more knowledgeable than me.
:{{DIcon}} If even the Chief Justice doesn't know...
:{{DIcon}} ...Then we have no choice but to ask the Archon herself.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah... Wh&mdash;Why are you looking at me? I had nothing to do with it...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I&mdash;I don't know what happened there, either... H&mdash;Hey, stop staring at me...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 audienceh 01.ogg}} '''Surprised Audience Member:''' ...What does Lady Furina mean by that?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 audiencek 01.ogg}} '''Contemplative Audience Member:''' She says she has no idea either? But that's impossible... Didn't she create the Oratrice herself?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 audiencei 01.ogg}} '''Doubtful Audience Member:''' ...Yeah, so are the verdicts reliable or not? Can results like this really be called justice?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahem... My dearest citizens, did you really think we'd allow an incorrect verdict to be handed out in this court? Did you really believe that the judgment could be mistaken, or be the result of some sort of random mishap?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Don't tell me... you thought even I had been blindsided by the Oratrice's result?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... But the way she looked just now, it was pretty obvious she had no idea what was going on...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' However, given the state of things, I shall give you an explanation. Everything that just took place &mdash; including my supposed shock and bafflement &mdash; was a part of an elaborate performance, with every action meant to stir up drama and excitement.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And of course, for every performance, there is a script. Everything has unfolded exactly as I expected from the very beginning. As the embodiment of the very concept of justice, the Oratrice shall never render an arbitrary judgment!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If you thought Childe had nothing to do with the serial disappearances case, it is only because you have been blinded by the superficial appearance of innocence...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Everything he's done, not to mention the danger he poses, are beyond ordinary comprehension and completely unforgivable!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' All shall be revealed in time! You will come to understand my noble intentions, as well as the absolute correctness of the Oratrice's verdict. Hahahaha...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Now, having said that, although I hate to leave things hanging in suspense, it is now time for this performance to end. As the lead actress, I shall be the first to take my leave. Toodle-oo~
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...So she chose to make her escape after all, did she.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Er... So you're saying we shouldn't put much stock in what she just said?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Mm, she probably just put on that performance to save face. As for the truth, it's unlikely that she actually has any idea.
:{{DIcon}} Way to pull the rug out from under her...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, please be assured that I will continue to investigate this case in a personal capacity. Just as I promised, if the judgment has been incorrect, we will do our utmost to clear his name.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright... Even though we feel pretty badly for him, we'll take your word for it for now.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, he's done plenty of bad stuff, so he should have known he'd go to prison someday, right?

;(Talk to Neuvillette again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq006 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Monsieur Neuvillette, that power you showed when you took him down... Who are you, really?
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq006 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Hm? I am the Chief Justice of Fontaine, of course. If officers of the law lack the strength and capability to enforce it, then it makes a mockery of justice.

:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ugh, it's just been one thing after the other. I've been making non-stop trips between Poisson and the Court since then...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Everyone from Spina di Rosula organized a memorial for my father. We never held a memorial when he first died, since everyone knew that even if we held one back then, no one was going to come.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' This time, though, everyone in Poisson and even many people from the Court all attended.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so his name's definitely been cleared now! That's what we like to hear!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 marcillac 02.ogg}} '''Melus:''' It's been the dearest wish of Demoiselle all along.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hahaha... that blasted stubborn fool, I was right to put my faith in him. I'm so glad I didn't give up on the case all those years ago...
:{{DIcon}} Things turned out as well as they could have.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, by the way... I ran into [[Charlotte]] just after I left the memorial service.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, maybe it'd be more accurate to say that I knew that she would be there, and there was no way she'd just let me go...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh!? So you know Charlotte too? The Charlotte... journalist from [[The Steambird]]?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yeah, way back when I first became the president of the Spina di Rosula, she was all over me, wouldn't take no for an answer...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I believe the story was called "The True Heart of Darkness: Secret Tales of the Yellow Rose."
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' To be fair, though, it was a really flattering feature, hahaha... So we've been on pretty good terms ever since.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' She was trying to lean on our friendship to get me to do an exclusive piece on the serial disappearances case.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah, she told us about that... She's always been super interested in that case, so now, her wish has finally come true too!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, I told her to make sure that when she writes about you guys entering the Opera House with the critical evidence that you both sound really cool.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, now that's another thing to look forward to! We trust Charlotte's skills with a pen for sure!
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, and in other news, I also took Clorinde out for a meal.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Are you two on better terms now?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm... While you were investigating Vacher's headquarters, Clorinde gave testimony on my father's behalf.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It was thanks to her that we were able to turn the tide, I wanted to thank her... I mean, there's also no point in being awkward all the time... so, we took the chance to reconcile with each other.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's great! Paimon also thought Clorinde wasn't actually a bad person. It's always good to have more friends.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, now that the case has finally been solved, perhaps it will slowly begin to fade from the public consciousness.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, actually, there's still one last thing I need to do...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...I should pay a visit to my father's grave, and tell him the truth of what happened, as well as how it all ended.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And on top of that, just how much people still look up to him to this day...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...That includes me, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 silver 02.ogg}} '''Silver:''' Miss Navia...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 marcillac 03.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Indeed.
:{{DIcon}} ...Can I come, too?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mhm, we want to go, too! We also think Callas is a really admirable person.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Sure thing. I'd like you two to share the moment with me. After all, without you, there might not have been such a positive ending.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 marcillac 04.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Then in that case, everyone, let's be off. Considering the recent weather, we'll be lucky if we can reach Poisson before dark...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 13 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yeah, you're right... It's been raining non-stop for a few days now.
:;(The group arrives at the graveyard)<!-- Black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' This is where my father's grave is... To be perfectly honest, even I haven't been back here for a long time.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, there's someone there already... Wait, that figure, it can't be...?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Isn't that Neuvillette? Why would the Chief Justice be here... Eh, Navia?
:;(Navia walks up to Neuvillette)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...Mm?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...My apologies. I should have asked before coming to pay my respects.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Don't say that.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Sorry about that.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, I was trying to say there's no need for you to apologize.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I wanted to show my father how much I've grown, but still, I doubt I've grown to the point that even the Chief Justice would feel compelled to apologize to me over and over.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In that case... I will stop apologizing for now.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You really could use some pointers on understanding human emotions, Monsieur Neuvillette...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In any case... why did you come to Poisson?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Hmm... Well, ever since that day, I've been turning a question over and over in my head... Just what is justice, anyway?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' There was once a time when I didn't want to believe that there could be anything more important to humans than life itself.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' No, rather than that, it's probably more truthful to say I didn't believe humans were capable of resisting the most basic instinct of living things. That they could rebel against their own nature, or consider certain things to be more important than their own lives.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Which is also why I didn't stop your father from beginning that fateful duel...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I believed that a truly innocent man would never throw away his life like that. That there was nothing... should have been nothing more important than one's own continued survival.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But Mr. Callas proved me utterly and decisively wrong.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If not for his sacrifice, the serial disappearances case would have remained unsolved to this day.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Mr. Callas made the choice he did for his daughter, for his associates, and for many people completely unrelated to him...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And in the end, from a certain perspective, one could say that he did it all for the sake of justice.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' A justice that is higher than... life itself.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' So, you asked me why I came here.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I just wanted to say my apologies to Mr. Callas in person... I should have noticed all of this much sooner.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' This regret has filled me with a sadness that has haunted me for days.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That high and mighty chair in the Opera Epiclese indeed insulates one from many important things. Spina di Rosula, thank you so much for your hard work and perseverance.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I... I'm sorry for being mad at you before.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So you're actually... One of those types that's cold on the outside but pretty thoughtful on the inside, huh? That reminds me of [[Silver]], one of my guys...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Sorry about that. Self-expression is not one of my strong suits.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Didn't I just say you don't need to apologize...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so Navia and Neuvillette seem to have made their peace as well...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's not disturb them for now... We can wait until after they're done.
:{{Black Screen|Following Navia and Neuvillette, you also pay your respects to Callas...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... Paimon's never paid respects at someone's grave before, did Paimon do anything rude there?
:{{DIcon}} Well, you're not usually supposed to fly around someone's grave.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon didn't know that was a thing... But... But Paimon doesn't know what she should do if she can't fly...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nooo... Paimon hopes Miss Navia won't be too mad...
:{{DIcon}} (Wow, she took it seriously...)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 14 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, Neuvillette is still standing around there... It's not often that we can catch him alone like this, so why don't we go talk to him for a bit? If we can't talk to Lady Furina, we can at least talk to him, right?

;(Talk to Navia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq006 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Paimon's really sorry, Navia, but Paimon did something pretty disrespectful just now...
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq006 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Uh... What're you saying, Paimon? I don't think I get it...
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq006 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... Aren't you not supposed to fly around someone's grave?
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq006 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh? Hehe, who told you that...
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq006 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}! Why did you mess with Paimon again!?

;(Talk to Neuvillette)
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Oh, it's you two. Did Miss Navia invite you to come pay your respects to her father?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mhm! We ran into Navia on the streets today, so we just followed her here.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I see, I see. Then, is there something that I can help you with?
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... Um... Well, it's pretty hard to run into you like this, since you're usually super busy, so we figured we could try to ask you a few questions, if that's okay...
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please feel free. Though outsiders, you helped us solve one of the greatest mysteries in Fontaine, and it would be my pleasure to return the favor.
:{{DIcon}} About Water from the Primordial Sea...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So at court, the bad guys referred to that special water as Water from the Primordial Sea... But what is it, really?
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04a 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Truthfully, that name is already quite accurate. I can only surmise that Vacher and his ilk only learned of its nature and existence after extensive research.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04a 2.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' There used to be a special sea on the surface of this planet. The nature of its seawater was rather different from that of the sea we know today...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04a 3.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Most of Teyvat's lifeforms were first born in that special sea. You could say it nurtured much of the life on this planet.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so it really was where everything began... It makes sense to call it "Primordial" then.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04a 4.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But today, the Primordial Sea no longer exists on the planet's surface.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04a 5.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' What Vacher discovered must have been some kind of special case, or a remnant from a truly ancient age.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03a 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so that's how it is... You really know everything, Monsieur Neuvillette. But if that's the case, then why would people, uh, at least people from Fontaine, dissolve in that kind of water?
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04a 6.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Indeed, why would the Primordial Sea &mdash; which was known to engender and nurture life &mdash; suddenly reverse itself and devour life instead?
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04a 7.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' To be frank, that also doesn't match my understanding of this world and its laws. There must still be some unknown secrets around the people of this land.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Is there anything else you'd like to ask me about?
:{{DIcon}} About the "prophecy" that has been circulating around Fontaine...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04b 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...That the sea levels will rise, and everyone will be dissolved in water, leaving Furina crying alone on her throne, but the sins of the people will be finally washed away for good?
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04b 2.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Does that appropriately summarize the version you've heard?
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! It was Lyney that told us back then, and that about covers all the main points.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04b 3.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Yes, up to the present, I think we reached a point where we have no choice but to confront this prophecy directly.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04b 4.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Rumors have it that this prophecy is rooted in the last words the [[Egeria|former Hydro Archon]] left to the world before she passed away.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A prophecy... of the former Hydro Archon? Wow, this is the first time that we've ever heard of it...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04b 5.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Two parts of the prophecy have already proven correct: the rising sea levels, and the ability of the people of Fontaine to be dissolved. We should be more vigilant, and stay on the watch for further signs.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04b 6.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Speaking of the prophecy, Furina has also always taken it quite seriously. Indeed, she has been collecting information and intelligence from across Teyvat for this purpose.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04b 7.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If the rumors were true, then perhaps this prophecy is the "conundrum" left to Furina by her predecessor.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03b 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But with Furina being the way she is... can we really trust her to solve it?
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Is there anything else you'd like to ask me about?
:{{DIcon}} About Childe...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' My apologies. My investigation has still not reached its conclusion.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 2.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, I still believe the judgment of the Oratrice was not rendered arbitrarily.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03c 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? But you also said you thought he was innocent...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 3.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' For many years, I have been quite aware that the Oratrice does not simply mechanically repeat the verdict that I give on each case.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 4.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As a divinely created mechanism, the people's unified faith in the concept of justice is integrated into it.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 5.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Not only can it produce the incredible power of Indemnitium, but it likely also possesses other traits... such as self-awareness.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 6.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Which is all to say I've been prepared for a situation like this for a long time.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03c 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so when Lyney told us that he heard a human voice from the room where the Oratrice's core is stored...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 7.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I was not aware such a thing had occurred... Perhaps that could serve to prove my conjecture. I will add that to the list of items to investigate.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 8.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In any case, I am inclined to believe that the Oratrice does have a methodology all its own... We just do not have enough information.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 9.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Based on Furina's reaction, I doubt even she had any idea what was going on. She managed to bluff her way through it, though, with time-tested twin tricks of bravado and drama.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' While we do intend to get to the bottom of this, for now, we regret to say that the Fatui Harbinger will just have to bide his time in the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04c 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If we did incorrectly convict him of crimes he did not commit, we will most certainly compensate him to the fullest extent allowed by the law.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 03c 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you ask Paimon, the only compensation he'll want is a no holds barred fight with you&nbsp;...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Is there anything else you'd like to ask me about?
:{{DIcon}} About [[Traveler's Sibling|my sibling]]...
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04d 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Your sibling? Another blond-haired traveler... I'm sorry, but I've never seen anyone who matches that description.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04d 2a.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 04d 2b.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If {{MC|m=she|f=he}} ever stepped foot in Fontaine, I'm sure {{MC|m=she|f=he}} followed our laws to the letter, and had no reason to appear on the stage of the Opera Epiclese.
::{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Is there anything else you'd like to ask me about?

;(After selecting all the options)
:{{DIcon}} I have no more questions.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Very well. It was my honor to provide you with what answers I could. I very much enjoyed conversing with you.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It will soon be time for me to leave this blissful tranquility behind, and return to Palais Mermonia.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You really are super busy, Monsieur Neuvillette! Paimon thought you only came here to pay your respects today because you had the day off.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Crime and villainy do not have the day off, and so justice must work around the clock as well. This is merely the nature of a Justice's work.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, alright, you've got a point.
:{{A|vo fdaq006 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Paimon just noticed that the rain has stopped.
