==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vuillermoz:''' Oh no, oh no, I'm definitely going to get fired...
:{{DIcon}} Did you cause some kind of disaster?
::'''Vuillermoz:''' I didn't do anything, but it's just that... I really think they're going to fire me.
::'''Vuillermoz:''' I've never felt like I truly deserve to be at the Institute. And that feeling is getting stronger.
:;(After completing ''[[Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble]]'')
:::'''Vuillermoz:''' *sigh* I'm no outstanding genius like you, you even earned the title of Honorary Senior Researcher...
::{{DIcon}} Why are you thinking about that?
:::'''Vuillermoz:''' I used to be part of Mr. [[Edwin Eastinghouse]]'s [[Arkhium]] research team...
:::'''Vuillermoz:''' But I only handled really peripheral jobs. I just took notes and wrote up reports... Worked out statistics, monitored the instruments, that kind of thing...
:::'''Vuillermoz:''' Even then, I didn't understand why all those geniuses would want someone like me working with them. I'm not clever or talented. I'm not even a very good learner.
:::'''Vuillermoz:''' I only escaped the explosion because I couldn't face going to work that day. I called in sick and slept in.
:::'''Vuillermoz:''' I never imagined I'd wake up to find out my research group was almost wiped out in a huge explosion...
:::{{DIcon}} So what are you in charge of now?
::::'''Vuillermoz:''' Me? Nothing. Mr. [[Raimondo]] asked me to help supervise the reconstruction work, but... Well, I'm completely clueless about that kind of thing.
::::'''Vuillermoz:''' And when Mr. Raimondo realizes how useless I am he's bound to fire me.
::::'''Vuillermoz:''' *Sigh* Maybe I should just quit and go and find a more suitable job...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Vuillermoz:''' See you.
::'''Vuillermoz:''' *sigh* I wonder what kind of work I'm suited for...
