==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
This particular Iktomisaurus, along with its young, was outwitted by [[Mamull]], a scammer that forced it to play his game or its child would suffer. When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] were drawn to his game, the Iktomisaurus sighed, knowing that they were being scammed but felt helpless to stop it. The Traveler and Paimon eventually realized they were being scammed and freed the chick from its cage. Desiring payback against the scammer, the Iktomisaurus told them to continue playing. After exposing his act, the Iktomisaurus attacked Mamull, sending him packing. The Iktomisaurus then bowed to the Traveler and Paimon in gratitude before departing with its child in tow.
