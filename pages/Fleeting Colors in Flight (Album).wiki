|ja_note = The phrase {{Lang|mini=1|ja=星霜}} literally reads as ''star'' + ''frost'' and thus, "starry-frost." In Chinese and Japanese literature, it is also a term that means "fleeting years": 星 is used to denote years and time in general, as stars circle the heavens every year, while frost (snow) also symbolizes of new year since it falls every winter.
