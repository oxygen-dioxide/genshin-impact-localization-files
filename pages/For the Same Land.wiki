{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's been a few days since the battle. Hopefully the tribes are getting back to normal...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Flower-Feather Clan was hit the hardest, right? That's Chasca's tribe. Maybe we should check how everyone's doing.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We might be able to help them out!

;(Approach the marked location in the Flower-Feather Clan)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, isn't that Iansan? Wonder what she's doing here...

;(Talk to Bahati, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 bahati 01.ogg}} '''Bahati:''' Whoa! Are you {{Traveler}} and Paimon?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure are! You know us?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 bahati 02.ogg}} '''Bahati:''' Everyone in Natlan does! I heard you're gonna fight alongside the Pyro Archon in the final battle... Good luck!

;(Approach Iansan)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 yopia 01.ogg}} '''Yopia:''' I brought all the stuff over, Coach. What's next?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Just take it easy before the real work begins.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You two are in charge of repairing the houses to the north. The rest of you should go west. The road practically crumbled beneath my feet on my way here &mdash; the whole thing will need to be reinforced.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 matlan 01.ogg}} '''Matlan:''' Alright! I'll start by moving the boxes over.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 hueliyo 01.ogg}} '''Hueliyo:''' I'll help you. These things can get pretty heavy.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 matlan 02.ogg}} '''Matlan:''' No, no... I got this. These muscles aren't just for show, you know. See that? Perfectly defined! I can lift this stuff up with one hand!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 hueliyo 02.ogg}} '''Hueliyo:''' Fine, as long as you don't wind up too sore to move tomorrow. I don't want to hear any complaints from you!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 matlan 03.ogg}} '''Matlan:''' Just prepare to be amazed... *heave*
:;(Matlan's lower spine makes a loud, uncomfortable-sounding crack)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 matlan 04.ogg}} '''Matlan:''' Aah, my back...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Well, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger... Take him to get some rest and apply some meds.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Take it easy for the next few days, alright? I don't want this getting worse, and don't push yourself. You can help out once you're better.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 matlan 05.ogg}} '''Matlan:''' *sigh*... I knew I should've trained harder...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Working out is different from real work. You gotta ease into it... Anyone still not have an assignment? Chief Mutota needs our help.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Iansan!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' {{Traveler}}! Paimon! What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were just about to ask you the same thing! We didn't expect to run into you in these parts.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Well, my tribe's in pretty good shape, all things considered &mdash; we're already done with all the repairs. I heard the Flower-Feather Clan was hit a lot worse, though, so I decided to come help.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' On the way, I ran into a caravan of merchants from my tribe and brought them along. These are my students.
:{{DIcon}} Students...?
::{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 09a 1.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oh, I didn't tell you before?
::{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 09a 2.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I'm a professional trainer. I design workout plans, meal plans, all that good stuff. If you're interested in a particular sport, I'm happy to whip you into shape!
:{{DIcon}} Right! You're a sports coach!
::{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 09b 1.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Haha, good memory! You a sports lover? I can design a training plan for you!
::{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 09b 2.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Looks like you're in pretty good shape already. Competitive fighting, extreme sports &mdash; you could take your pick! As for you, Paimon... We might have to start you off on a balanced meal plan.
::{{A|vo ntaq201 3 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What!? There's nothing wrong about Paimon's current meal plan! Like today, Paimon just had some [[Blazed Meat Stew]], [[Fried Shrimp Beanballs]], [[Sour Sauce Ceviche]],<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Sour Sauce Kipper", due to name change after VO was recorded</ref> and [[Stuffed N' Mashed Potatoes]]... That's practically nothing!
::{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 09b 3.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hmm, this case sounds even worse than I imagined... I know just the thing &mdash; kale juice! I'll make you some soon.
::{{A|vo ntaq201 3 paimon 03b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kale juice... Wait! Isn't that your favorite drink, {{Traveler}}? If Iansan's going to make some for free, Paimon would feel terrible if you won't get to try it...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 10.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Anyway, that's enough idle talk for now. A little while earlier, the chief asked me to bring a few people to help with something.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 11.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Are you two free? As you can see, due to... unforeseen circumstances, I'm short a few people.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course, we're also here to help! Let's go see the chief.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 3 iansan 12.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Perfect! Then follow me.

;(Talk to Ohtli or Yopia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 ohtli 01.ogg}} '''Ohtli:''' Nice to see you, friend. Thanks for coming to help again.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 yopia 01.ogg}} '''Yopia:''' No thanks necessary! Wanna grab a drink tonight?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 ohtli 02.ogg}} '''Ohtli:''' On any other day, I would, but... Something's going on with the tribe, and it's kinda keeping me up at night.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 yopia 02.ogg}} '''Yopia:''' Don't worry! I'm sure Coach Iansan will figure out what to do. I've never seen a problem she can't handle!

;(Approach Mutota)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 8 iansan 01.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq201 7 iansan 01.ogg}}--> '''Iansan:''' We made it, Chief.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 8 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' You're here, Iansan! Oh, and you must be {{Traveler}} and Paimon. I've heard a lot about you. I'm sure we'll have a much better time now with your help.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Let's just get straight to the point. Are the people behind you warriors from your tribe? Did something bad happen to them?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 atoco 01.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Cold... So cold. [[Duarte]], are you there?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 atoco 02.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' I'm drowning... And there's something in the water...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's on the ground, but it almost looks like he's trying to... swim?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 cochitta 01.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' Hehehe...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 cochitta 02.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' The Abyss... The Abyss is coming...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 cochitta 03.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' There are eyes in my hands, and hands in my stomach, and my stomach is full of teeth... It ate all of you. It's coming for me, too.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, we haven't been eaten. We're right here!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 ocotlan 01.ogg}} '''Ocotlan:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 ocotlan 02.ogg}} '''Ocotlan:''' Monstrous beasts! How did you get in here!?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' *sigh* As you can see, their mental state is quite poor.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 02.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' They went missing after the battle. We found them in the wilderness in the days that followed, but the damage had already been done...
:{{DIcon}} What could have caused this?
:{{DIcon}} Do you have any idea?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 03.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' We found them unconscious in areas corrupted by Abyssal Tumors, lying next to their deceased comrades. My only guess is that something terrible must have happened during the battle...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 04.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' According to the [[Biram|chief of the Masters of the Night-Wind]], sudden exposure to a large amount of Abyssal power can have mental as well as physical repercussions.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 05.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' We've never seen the effects this heightened before, but maybe [[Gosoythoth]] was just too powerful.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gosoythoth? What's that?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 06.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' It's the Abyssal monster that appeared in the sky not too long ago. After consulting our ancient legends, we decided to call it Gosoythoth, "Reaper of the Abyss."
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that giant black ball! Didn't we force it to retreat, though?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 07.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' True, it poses no threat to us now, but whatever wound it inflicted on these warriors still endures. We scoured all sorts of records for a solution, but... nothing came of it.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 08.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' There was some mention of a treatment from several hundred years ago, but that knowledge is long gone...
:{{DIcon}} I could try to help?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right, you can purify Abyssal power! Might as well give it a try!
:{{Color|menu|You try to purify the Abyssal power within them, but their mental state appears unchanged.}}
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It... It didn't work?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 09.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' That must mean purifying the Abyssal power within them still isn't enough... In any case, thank you for trying.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 izcalli 01.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' So, what can we do now? Don't tell me... My friend is just going to be like this forever?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 cuallee 01.ogg}} '''Cuallee:''' Come back to me, Cochitta! Please, don't leave me like this...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 utsil 01.ogg}} '''Utsil:''' We beat Gosoythoth... They survived the battle! Are we really just gonna to sit back and watch them lose their minds?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Of course not.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 mutota 10.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' What is it, Iansan?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' We'll take it case by case. First of all, we shouldn't keep them cooped up in here. The environment isn't doing them any good.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Let them go where they feel comfortable, and {{Traveler}}, Paimon, and I will talk to them.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 ticitl 01.ogg}} '''Ticitl:''' But...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 utsil 02.ogg}} '''Utsil:''' Are you sure about this?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I know you're worried, but we don't have any other solution, right? Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't... But, we won't know until we try.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Well? Don't just stand there &mdash; let them go. Send someone to follow them, but don't stick too close. We just need to keep tabs on them.
:{{Black Screen|Following Iansan's command, the crowd disperses.}}
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Alright, it's up to us now. Let's talk to them one by one.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 9 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' This is a bad situation, but I know the warriors will find a way to pull through. After all, we've overcome so many challenges already, what's one more?
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Given that none of you knew how to handle these extremely unusual hallucinations, Iansan suggested that you "just need to act." Time to hunt down a way to help everyone return to normal.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 19 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Let's see... One of those guys was talking about being cold. Do you still remember him?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 19 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' It's not often that you see someone almost drown on dry land... Let's go talk to him.

;(Talk to Mutota, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, we haven't seen [[Chasca]] around here. Where is she?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 mutota 01.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' She's busy clearing out the remaining monsters and tracking down missing warriors.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 mutota 02.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' She was the one who brought Atoco back from the wilderness. Many warriors are still out there unconscious or injured, unable to make it back to the tribe. With Chasca's help, we can prevent a lot of unnecessary deaths.

;(Talk to Utsil, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 utsil 01.ogg}} '''Utsil:''' *sigh* Looks like he's not going anywhere. I don't know why, but he's looking at us with such... hatred.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 utsil 02.ogg}} '''Utsil:''' Anyway, please don't let me keep you. I'll stay here and keep an eye on him.

;(Talk to Munay or Ocotlan, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 ocotlan 01.ogg}} '''Ocotlan:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 munay 01.ogg}} '''Munay:''' It's alright, my boy. Papa's here.

;(Talk to Yareche, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 yareche 01.ogg}} '''Yareche:''' Stupid Abyss...
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 yareche 02.ogg}} '''Yareche:''' This shouldn't have happened to Cochitta... Her younger brother must be devastated.

;(Talk to Izcalli, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 izcalli 01.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' Atoco, my friend... Hang in there. I know you can get through this.

;(Talk to Cochitta, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 cochitta 01.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' The world is spinning, the mountains are parting. There are eyes, countless eyes... always watching... always staring. They're going to get me... consume me...

;(Talk to Atoco)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 atoco 01.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' *sobbing*
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Found him... Hello, can you hear me?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 atoco 02.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' So dark... So cold... I want to go home...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Okay! Just wait a little longer, and we'll take you home.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' The caravan from my tribe should have brought some firewood... I think starting a bonfire might help.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' When it's dark, damp, and cold, what's better than a fire?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Maybe the light and warmth will help change what he sees... Wait here while I grab some firewood.
:{{Color|menu|You light a bonfire...}}
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 atoco 03.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 atoco 04.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Light... Underwater? Where is it coming from?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's working!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 atoco 05.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Is someone there? Please save me... No, wait, you have to leave this place! The water's too deep! You won't make it!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' It's okay, we brought some friends from the People of the Springs. They're great swimmers! We're here to save you.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 atoco 06.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' No... Please... Just leave me...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 atoco 07.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Duarte...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, it's not working anymore!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Looks like the bonfire wasn't enough.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 22 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That was the second time he mentioned the name "Duarte"... Maybe we can start there. Let's ask around and see what we can learn.

;(Talk to Atoco again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 atoco 01.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' I'm... drowning...

;(Talk to Izcalli)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 01.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' My friend... Is he any better?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' We're working on it, but I wanted to ask... Does the name "Duarte" ring any bells for you?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 02.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' Duarte? Oh yeah, I remember...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 03.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' Duarte was the name of Atoco's saurian companion. Atoco almost drowned as a child, and Duarte was the one who saved him.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 04.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' He dove deep into the water and used all his strength to carry Atoco back to the surface. It was pretty touch and go, but both of them made it in the end.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That means we just need to bring Duarte here, and&mdash;
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 05.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' Well, you see... Duarte died four years ago during an Abyss invasion. He was helping evacuate injured warriors from the front lines, but fell to an ambush.
:{{DIcon}} ...Maybe we don't need the real Duarte.
::{{A|vo ntaq201 24 paimon 01a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, what do you mean?
::{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 06a 1.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' You're right... Duarte didn't have many distinguishing features. I don't think he ever stood out next to the others.
::{{DIcon}} We just need to impersonate him.
:{{DIcon}} What did Duarte look like?
::{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 06b 1.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' He was a bit on the smaller side, but other than that, he was just your average Qucusaur.
::{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 06b 2.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' Hold on, what are you planning?
::{{DIcon}} We just need to impersonate him.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Based on the look on your face, I'm guessing you already have a plan.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Alright, let's get to work... Oh, and thank you for the information. We'll do whatever we can to help your friend.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 24 izcalli 07.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' No problem. Thank you for looking out for him.

;(Talk to Izcalli again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 izcalli 02.ogg}} '''Izcalli:''' If only Duarte was still alive...

;(Indwell a Qucusaurus)
:{{DIcon}} (Found one! Now, we just need to borrow its identity.)

;(Talk to Atoco while indwelling a Qucusaurus)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 28 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're back... How are you feeling?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 28 atoco 01.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Duarte...?
:{{DIcon}} (Step forward)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 28 atoco 02.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' How... How did you get here? Are you here to save me?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 28 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's working!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 28 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Shhh...!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 28 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' What now?
:{{DIcon}} (Tap his head with your claw)
::{{A|vo ntaq201 29 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Wait! Not so hard...
::{{A|vo ntaq201 29 atoco 01.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Ah, that hurt... Duarte, you have to get out of here! There's something in the water!
::{{DIcon}} (That didn't work...)
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} (Let out a low roar)
::{{A|vo ntaq201 30 atoco 01.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' You sense it, don't you? This place is dangerous...
::{{A|vo ntaq201 30 atoco 02.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Still, hahaha... Hearing you make that noise reminds me of our first few battles together. You were such a little thing back then, and I also had no idea what I was doing...
::{{DIcon}} (He's still trapped in the hallucination.)
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} (Push him lightly from behind)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 31 atoco 01.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Ah, you're going to carry me out of here, just like last time.

:{{A|vo ntaq201 32 atoco 05.ogg}} '''Atoco:''' Izcalli? What's going on? All I remember is the battle against the Abyss, and then... I was drowning, and a saurian that looked like Duarte saved me. How did I get here?

:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' It's okay, there's nothing to fear. Gosoythoth has lost. Nothing can hurt you anymore.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cochitta 02.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' It's no use. It'll just come back... Nothing can stop it. Nothing can stop the Abyss!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cochitta 03.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' It will devour everyone. Heh... One day, we'll all be reunited in the pit of its stomach.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe it's just Paimon, but she seems to be in even worse shape than Atoco.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She can talk to us, but nothing she says makes any sense. She also seems really afraid...

:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I wonder what triggered it... The battle against the Abyss? Or maybe, like Atoco, it's some deep-rooted fear, and the Abyss just made it worse.

:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 02.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' I think you're on to something... The mental distress does seem to be connected to pre-existing fears and anxieties.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 03.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Cochitta doesn't like it when people talk about her past, but the situation is urgent, so I guess I'll be the bad guy.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 04.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Iansan, do you believe there are people in this world destined for battle?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yes, I get that feeling sometimes when I'm instructing a particularly gifted student. It's something like... "wow, you were born to play this sport."
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 05.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Then, what about people destined to be unfit for battle?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' What do you mean?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 06.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' When Cochitta was little, her parents died fighting the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 07.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' She was only eleven or twelve at the time, and her brother even younger still. The two saw their parents collapse in a pool of blood as flames roared and spread all around them...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 08.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Cochitta trained hard to become a warrior, but still found fighting abyss monsters too difficult to handle. She and her brother were left with severe trauma after the incident, pain and fear that they could not get over no matter what.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, isn't Cochitta one of the warriors who fought the Abyss? Didn't you find her unconscious out on the field?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 09.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Yes, we did. You see, something changed within her several years ago when the Abyss attacked our tribe, and broke into her home.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 10.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' By the time the guards rushed to the scene, they found her standing there, weapon outstretched, hands trembling, her brother huddling behind her for safety...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 11.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' And the Abyss monster dead at her feet. She didn't even look at it, and just kept repeating the same thing over and over &mdash; "you're the only family I have left. I won't let anything happen to you."
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 12.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' She became a completely different person after that. She earned a reputation as a very capable warrior, and fought countless battles against the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 13.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' We all thought she overcame the trauma, and we were so happy for her, but now it seems like even if she buried it deep within herself, the fear still never left her.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Maybe fighting the Abyss was her way of making sure she wouldn't lose anyone else.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 09.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Maybe the thought of experiencing that pain again scared her more than the Abyss. On the outside, her choice to fight made her seem strong, but she never forgot the trauma of that night... The Abyss just brought it back to the surface.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How can we help her?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 10.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' This one is tricky. If we can find the right opportunity, then&mdash;

:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 11.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hold on, Chief Mutota. Looks like Cochitta is responding to his words.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cochitta 07.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' If Cuallee goes to battle... the Abyss will devour him...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cochitta 08.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' I can't let that happen. I have to do something...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cochitta 09.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' But, it's useless. No one can beat the Abyss. It's a death sentence, just like what happened to Mom and Dad...
:{{DIcon}} The Abyss isn't indestructible.
:{{DIcon}} You've defeated countless monsters already.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cochitta 10.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' But I'm no warrior... I'm just a coward. Still... I have to protect Cuallee. What should I do?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cuallee 04.ogg}} '''Cuallee:''' Cochitta...
:{{DIcon}} I think you just need to fight it one more time.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cochitta 11.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' Fight it... one more time?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 12.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Good idea, {{Traveler}}... Her fear of the Abyss runs deep, but she still has the will to fight.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 13.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' She just needs to defeat an Abyss monster by herself, and we can prove to her that the Abyss isn't indestructible, just like you said!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 14.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I think it's worth a try. Plus, with us around, we can make sure she won't get hurt. Although, that also means finding an Abyss monster...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 16.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' Try checking the mountains to the north. A few fled in that direction after the battle.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 mutota 17.ogg}} '''Mutota:''' I dispatched a team to clear them out, so most of them should be gone. But, there might still be a few stragglers.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 15.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Great! Then let's go right now. Cochitta, think you can make it?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cochitta 12.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' There's no turning back. I have to face it, even if it will devour me whole...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 cuallee 05.ogg}} '''Cuallee:''' I'm coming, too! I'm not letting my sister face this alone! Not anymore!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 35 iansan 16.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Alright, then stick close. Let's go!

:{{A|vo ntaq201 37 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' How can we make this easier for her...? I guess we could wear them down first, but I think it's better to stand guard for now. We should wait for the right moment to intervene.

:{{A|vo ntaq201 42 cochitta 07.ogg}} '''Cochitta:''' I've always envied warriors who don't get scared or feel lost. It really felt like I was getting stronger over the years, but in the end, maybe I never made any progress at all...

:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Haha, well who am I to turn down such a nice compliment!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Most people say the first step is the hardest. But, it's not actually all that hard. Exaggerating the difficulty in your own head is where the fear comes in.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' "I'll never get it," "Might as well not try”... I hear that kind of talk all the time. But, if you break your goal into smaller parts, the first steps might actually turn out to be the easiest.

:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Just like when I told you to eat less meat and drink more kale juice.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 07.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You probably heard that and thought... "I can never eat meat again. I have to drink kale juice for every meal. I'll practically starve..."
:{{DIcon}} That's why Paimon was so against it.
:{{DIcon}} I'd probably feel the same way...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hee-hee...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 08.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' In reality, all it takes to start is eating two fewer servings of Blazed Meat Stew and adding some kale juice for nutrition. That's it! It's not about making drastic changes all at once.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds like something Paimon could do! But, would that really change anything?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 09.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Consistency is key! You can't accomplish your goals in one fell swoop. You have to eat away at them little by little.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 10.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' My Ancient Name means "power," did you know that? So, everyone thought I would grow up to be this tall, burly, muscular warrior.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 11.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' But, that's not what happened. A lot of people were confused and disappointed. My fellow warriors couldn't understand why I inherited that name over them.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 12.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' At first, I also felt lost. It was only later that I realized true strength basically boils down to problem-solving. Physical strength is just a means to an end like everything else.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 13.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' So, I began to break problems down into smaller parts. When facing an impossible situation, you just need to act. And if you fail, so what? That's just life.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 49 iansan 14.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Anyway, that's what I've learned over the years. Maybe it'll come in handy for you some day.

:{{A|vo ntaq201 55 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' So, you've seen this illness before?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 55 thecaptain 03.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Direct contact with high concentrations of Abyssal power causes irreversible mental trauma in most people.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 55 thecaptain 04.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' The exact presentation will vary according to trauma level. Some will suffer from superficial hallucinations and maintain the capacity to perceive the outside world. In such cases, verbal and physical interaction can be used to break through the hallucination.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 55 thecaptain 05.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' However, there are also those who are so far gone, entrenched in hallucinations so deep, that medical intervention is the only option. That's why we developed the [[Draught of Lucidity]].
:{{A|vo ntaq201 55 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Draught of... Lucidity?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 55 thecaptain 06.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' It's a kind of medicine that can dispel the psychological impact of the Abyss. The treatment comes with severe side-effects, including chronic migraines for the rest of the patient's life, so it's reserved for the worst cases.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 55 thecaptain 07.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' This man is a devoted warrior, one not easily swayed from battle. That is precisely why it's so difficult to pull him out of this hallucination.

:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} You saved the day.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 01.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Think nothing of it. I agreed to offer you my aid, so this is merely a part of that duty.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 02.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Besides... I care deeply about this land.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! When we were with Mavuika, you told us you and your soldiers defended Natlan against the Abyss five hundred years ago.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 03.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' That's right. My desire to protect this nation remains unchanged.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 04.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' When my platoon arrived in Natlan five hundred years ago, like you, we were true outlanders. But, as time passed, I encountered the people of this land and witnessed their desperate struggle against the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 05.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Though many of the warriors were rash and inexperienced, they were steadfast and fearless in battle, willing to do anything to protect their fellow citizens... oftentimes with complete disregard for their own survival.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 06.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Just as I fought for the glory of Khaenri'ah, they fought for the survival of their nation. We happened to share a common enemy, so I decided to offer my aid.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 07.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' We fought side by side to the very end. I traveled to many places after that, but I never forgot this land. Even now... My work in Natlan remains unfinished.
:{{DIcon}} Natlan hasn't forgotten you, either.
::{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 08a 1.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' They remember who I used to be &mdash; the "Sentinel Knight" who fought with the Masters of the Night-Wind. Still, I prefer to leave all that in the past.

::{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 08b 1.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' ...
::{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 08b 2.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' It may seem difficult to understand, but the reason is really quite simple.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 09.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' That name carries with it the glory of my homeland and the honor of Natlan. Yet, I failed to bring my soldiers home, and I failed to help Natlan defeat the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, that's not your fault! The Abyss is way stronger than any of us imagined...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 10.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' You need not comfort me. I am no longer who I once was... Let the events of the past continue to collect dust in the annals of history. I will continue to help Natlan in my own way.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like with the Draught of Lucidity?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who knew you could make medicine! Were you a doctor before?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 11.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' The draught was [[Guthred]]'s invention. He was a respected military doctor as well as my trusted second-in-command.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 12.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' We faced a similar situation to what you witnessed today. The endless battles against the Abyss triggered delusions among the soldiers, to the point where some attempted to kill each other.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 13.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' In order to develop a treatment as fast as possible, Guthred used himself as a test subject. He passed away shortly after the draught was complete.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 14.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' That's who he was &mdash; unrelenting in his pursuits, no matter the cost, no matter the sacrifice... in the end, he even gave himself up for a chance at success.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 15.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' I'm sure he would be pleased his creation aids people even now... The Abyss has wrought enough suffering on this land. I sincerely hope this war will end soon.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (No matter the cost, no matter the sacrifice... Huh, that sounds rather familiar.)
;(Flashback begins)

:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 17.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' However, some things are better kept secret for now. We may be working together, but our goals are not entirely aligned.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's with the secrets all of a sudden? Paimon's starting to think we should be more careful around you!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 18.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' I do not mean to jeopardize the trust between us. I simply prefer to keep this to myself because it's a personal matter.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 19.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' All I can tell you is this &mdash; Natlan may have survived the worst of the crisis, but the souls of this land are still not at peace.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 20.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' ...And that is why my work is not yet done.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if it's personal, then we'll just have to trust you.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 21.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' If you have other questions, I'm willing to answer them.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, like anything?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to know how you eat with the mask... Anything you want to ask, {{Traveler}}?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Actually... There is something I want to know.)
:;(The Traveler thinks back to Citlali's revelation about [[Ronova]]'s price for [[Mavuika]])
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Natlan must pay the price for Mavuika's use of the Ruler of Death's power. That price is death, and only Mavuika's death can clear the debt.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Even now that the war's over and the threat to Natlan is gone, it looks like that death is still set in stone.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Could The Captain know something about the Ruler of Death? I might not get this opportunity again. I should ask him.)
:{{DIcon}} (Ask about the Ruler of Death.)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 22.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' In the garden cultivated by the gods, flowers and weeds grow side by side. When the weeds compete for nutrients in the soil, the gardener intervenes to inhibit their growth.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 23.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' I'm not one to pass judgment based on my own standard of right and wrong. But, it is an undeniable fact that she is responsible for my suffering, as well as that of my people.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 24.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' If that explanation is too difficult to understand, allow me to show you exactly what I mean.
:{{Color|menu|The Captain removes his mask. Everyone is shocked to see his true appearance.}}
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah...!

:{{DIcon}} I don't know what I expected, but this is...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 25.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' The Ruler of Death can freely define the form of death, or grant immortality to anyone she desires.
:;(As he continues on, Il Capitano sets his mask back in place.)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 26.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Her power is a rule in and of itself. Faced with such an overwhelming level of power, it can feel hopeless to resist.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 27.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' But, I am of the belief that, in this world, no destiny is unchangeable, no death inevitable, and no rule unbreakable.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 thecaptain 28.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' ...So, before the final moment truly arrives, we must fight harder than ever.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}! Paimon!

:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Apparently, [[Xilonen]]'s ready to start forging your [[Ancient Name]]. She needs to check the progress of the [[Pilgrim's Chronicle]]... that device she gave you before.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 56 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' She invited a bunch of people to be there, including me. So, let's head to the Stadium once you're done here.

;(After the cutscene)

:{{A|vo ntaq201 57 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He kind of reminds Paimon of someone we met recently... Oh, right! The Lord of the Night!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 57 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They just seem so... tired, you know? Since they've both been alive for many centuries, do you think that's just what happens when you've been alive for too long...?

:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, looks like you're about to have that chance.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xilonen? Is everything all set?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 xilonen 16.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Almost... We're just missing one last thing. You've been by the {{Traveler}}'s side the longest, Paimon. We need to hear what you have to say.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, Paimon's not from Natlan...
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 xilonen 17.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It doesn't matter. As the {{Traveler}}'s companion, your contributions are extremely important. You're the perfect person to finish the story.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 xilonen 18.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Sorry, {{Traveler}}. I just need to borrow Paimon for a second. It should be quick.
:{{Black Screen|Despite Xilonen's assurance, quite a lot of time seems to pass.}}
:;(Paimon and Xilonen wave to the Traveler to return to the forge)
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 xilonen 19.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Phew...
:{{DIcon}} That took longer than expected.
:{{DIcon}} Did something go wrong?
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 xilonen 20.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Paimon gave us a lot, and I mean a lot, of information... I'm not even sure the Lord of the Night managed to get all of it.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Well, we've been to six nations already!
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 xilonen 21.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Here, you can have the Pilgrim's Chronicle back. I'll need it when I forge the name, but you can continue your adventures in the meantime.
:{{A|vo ntaq201 58 xilonen 22.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' When the time comes... I will forge you an Ancient Name unlike anything that's come before, so that you, Mavuika, and Natlan as a whole can finally put an end to this endless war.

;(Talk to Xilonen, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'll need the Pilgrim's Chronicle back when I'm ready to forge the name. If there are still adventures you want to record, better finish them before then.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq201 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I hope everything will go well... I swear, even I'm starting to feel nervous now.
