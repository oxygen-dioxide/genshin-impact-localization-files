:'''Sigewinne:''' I've been so busy looking after my patients recently, it's been a long time since I've been to the [[Palais Mermonia]]... 
:'''Sigewinne:''' I know, why don't I draw some cute stickers as a surprise for Monsieur Neuvillette?
:'''Ottnit:''' Let's take a look at Monsieur Neuvillette's itinerary for the day for some inspiration!

:'''Sigewinne:''' [[Sedene]] previously mentioned how Monsieur Neuvillette's been starting work at the Palais Mermonia very early in the morning, with huge piles of documents to get through.
:'''Ottnit:''' It's easy to forget to eat when you're so focused on your work. We need to give Monsieur Neuvillette a reminder.

;(Start Creating)
:'''Sigewinne:''' Ideas have popped into my head!

;(Choose a sticker)
:'''Sigewinne:''' I'll draw this~

;(Doodle on the canvas to draw a sticker)
:'''Sigewinne:''' I'm done~ But how should I give it to Monsieur Neuvillette without him noticing...
:'''Ottnit:''' Don't worry. Leave the sticker-pasting to me!

:'''Ottnit:''' Just now, I heard someone from the Palais Mermonia mention that Monsieur Neuvillette is planning to go out at noon.
:'''Sigewinne:''' I'm so glad to hear that! Going out for a stroll is a great way to keep the spirits up.

:'''Ottnit:''' Monsieur Neuvillette will be presiding over a trial at the [[Opera Epiclese]] tonight. 
:'''Ottnit:''' He looks even cooler than usual when he's up there in his seat of judgment!

;(Start Creating)
:'''Sigewinne:''' Maybe I should draw something special this time?

;(Choose a sticker)
:'''Sigewinne:''' Alright, I'll draw this one~

;(Doodle on the canvas to draw a sticker)
:'''Sigewinne:''' This is the last one! Thanks~
:'''Ottnit:''' Leave it to me!

;(Continue the event)
:'''Sigewinne:''' I wonder if Monsieur Neuvillette liked those stickers...
:'''Sigewinne:''' Huh? The reports from that day seem to be up on the bulletin board. Lemme take a look...

;(Click to view reports)
:'''Sigewinne:''' What truly fascinating reports. Humans really do see things quite differently from us Melusines, huh...
:'''Sigewinne:''' Oh, it's nearly time for us to meet. I'll go ask Monsieur Neuvillette what he thought of the stickers himself!
