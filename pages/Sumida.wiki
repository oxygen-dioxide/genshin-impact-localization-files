==Post-Quest Dialogue==
===Liyue Harbor===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sumida:''' What a pretty bracelet! What a pretty vase! Goods from Liyue sure are pretty!
:'''Sumida:''' ...Uh, wait, no. These simplistic terminologies will simply not do for a novelist like me.
:'''Sumida:''' Perhaps I should purchase one of these ingeniously-made porcelain trinkets and use it as reference material for my next novel...
:'''Sumida:''' Mm, yes, yes! That's what we'll write.
:'''Sumida:''' "The key to the turnaround was a Vision concealed within the vase!"
:'''Sumida:''' Yes, that could be quite interesting indeed! What do you think, Kama?
:'''Kama:''' Lady Sumida, I don't really...
:'''Kama:''' ...
:'''Kama:''' I feel that any descriptions of this vase should be well-controlled. If you spend too much time on it, the foreshadowing will become quite apparent. But at the same time, mentioning it too little will make that development seem abrupt.
:'''Sumida:''' Hmm, you do have a point indeed! Let me write this down...
:'''Sumida:''' Wait, no, let's do that somewhere else.
:'''Sumida:''' Also, haven't I told you a thousand times before not to call me "Lady"?
:'''Sumida:''' ...But then again, having one of a pair of seemingly ordinary travelers call the other "Lady" or "Lord" isn't that uncommon a plot development either, is it?

;(Talk to Kama and Sumida again)
:'''Kama:''' Lady Sumida, do you have any plans as to where we should go next?
:'''Sumida:''' Hmm... Now I've heard that Mondstadt is home to a very large library....
{{Dialogue end}}

===Mondstadt===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sumida:''' Phew&mdash; That felt good&mdash;
:'''Sumida:''' Or should I say "this is how the largest library in the north should be"? To think that I'd have the opportunity to finish the whole [[Vera's Melancholy]] series in one go! Ah, that was wonderful!
:'''Kama:''' Lady Sumida, it might be best to keep your voice down.
:'''Sumida:''' Ah, right. Sorry. I was getting too excited there...
:'''Kama:''' No, I'm worried that you might get hurt. That [[Lisa|librarian]] has an immense aura around her...
:'''Sumida:''' Eh? Really? I thought she was a rather typical, slightly-lazy witch.
:'''Sumida:''' ...Hmmm, but now that you mention it, these characters do tend to be the strongest. Um, right then, best not to get on her bad side...
:'''Sumida:''' Actually, I could write a story based on just such a character, couldn't I? Something like "The Mage of the Great Library"...
:{{DIcon}} How have your travels been going?
:'''Kama:''' Ah. It's been a while.
:'''Sumida:''' Oh ho, if it isn't the legendary (Traveler)...
:'''Sumida:''' Our travels? ...Hmmm, you know, I used to go out to travel to collect reference materials a lot.
:'''Sumida:''' I went to [[Musoujin Gorge]] to study how to write thunderstorms, headed to the [[Serpent's Head]] to learn how to describe a snake demon, I got Kama to join the military to better understand the lives of the Absconders...
:{{DIcon}} Man, being Kama's a tough job.
:'''Kama:''' It wasn't much.
:'''Sumida:''' But this on the other hand is a real journey. One with no real objective in mind.
:'''Sumida:''' Only now have I discovered that there are just so many interesting things worth writing about in this world, just like in Kino's Travels.
:'''Sumida:''' Kama and I visited the recommended sights and stores around these parts before camping out in the wild, exchanging stories with unfamiliar travelers by the campfire...
:'''Sumida:''' ...And when I woke up, we found our belongings all missing...
:{{DIcon}} ...Wait. So did that turn out okay in the end?
:'''Sumida:''' It did. Honestly, when we found out that the gang of thieves had ten or more members, I thought we weren't getting our stuff back.
:'''Sumida:''' But somehow, Kama was able to convince them to return our things. They even gave him these [[Treasure Hoarder Insignia|coins with raven insignias on them]] to go!
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} You're pretty good, Kama.
:'''Kama:''' I simply did as I should. You need not worry, Lady Sumida.
:'''Sumida:''' You really are indispensable, Kama!
:'''Sumida:''' With you by my side, I doubt we'd have any trouble, even if our adventures took us to the edge of the world itself!
:'''Sumida:''' Speaking of which, you really have changed a lot since the whole incident with Tsurumi Island. Here are things you want to do now, and opinions and doubts you want to express...
:'''Kama:''' Well, if you do not find it suitable, Lady Sumida...
:'''Sumida:''' No, no, I think it's great! Your views are all well-worth considering.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'll leave the two of you alone then.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps we'll meet again in some other place.
:'''Sumida:''' Indeed. See you, (Traveler). Let's meet at the end of all things, just like in "[[Flowers for Princess Fischl]]."
:'''Kama:''' See you, (Traveler). Take care of yourself.

;(Talk to Kama and Sumida again)
:'''Sumida:''' "The world is vast and infinite..."
:'''Kama:''' Is that a quote from "Joururi Kidoutai"?
:'''Sumida:''' That's right. Your memory's pretty sharp, Kama.
:'''Kama:''' It was a story you told me, after all.

==Trivia==
* In Sumida's dialogue while in Liyue Harbor, the line ''"The key to the turnaround was a Vision concealed within the vase!"'' may be a reference to the official [[Manga]]: In the last chapter, [[Kaeya]] visits [[Diluc]] to gift him a beautiful vase. Diluc will later find his Pyro Vision, which he had discarded years ago, inside the vase.
