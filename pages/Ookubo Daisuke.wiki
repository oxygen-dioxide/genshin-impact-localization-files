===Appearance===
Ookubo Daisuke wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ookubo Daisuke''': What a reliable leader General Gorou is...
:{{DIcon}} Oh, you are...
::'''Ookubo Daisuke''': I am a samurai of the [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya forces]], and I am in charge here while General Gorou is out.
::'''Ookubo Daisuke''': I'm sure you've heard the news: we've managed to hold the [[Shogunate]] forces off at the front lines!
::'''Ookubo Daisuke''': It must be said that General Gorou's leadership has been indispensable in allowing us to achieve such results!
::{{DIcon}} So, tell me more about Gorou...
::'''Ookubo Daisuke''': General Gorou is my greatest inspiration. He is skilled and valiant on the battlefield, and he is compassionate to his men off it &mdash; he sees us as his very own flesh and blood, almost.
::'''Ookubo Daisuke''': He's patient with our comrades even in the little things of life, helping them to resolve their problems.
::'''Ookubo Daisuke''': I doubt you could find a better general anywhere else!
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Ookubo Daisuke''': Farewell. Ah, if I were as capable as General Gorou... Haha, ah, who am I kidding?
