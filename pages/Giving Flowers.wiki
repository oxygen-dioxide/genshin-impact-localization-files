;(Approach Varsha)

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on [[Varsha]], optional)
:'''Varsha:''' (Heh, living alone isn't that difficult!)

:'''Paimon:''' Strange, what's this kid doing here? Hey kid! Why are you here all alone?
:'''???:''' Ah! A weird person, and a weird flying person.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey! That's rude!
:'''???:''' Yeah, that's right. Rude's my middle name. Didn't even have parents to teach me "manners," don'cha know?
:{{DIcon}} (There's a story behind this for sure...)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Anyway, we aren't weird people, and we definitely aren't bad guys.
:{{DIcon}} We're just a pair of kind travelers.
::'''Paimon:''' Exactly. And that's why we don't leave those who are troubled behind.
:{{DIcon}} We're looking for my lost {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}}...
::'''Paimon:''' Yes. So of course we got worried when we saw a little girl like you here all alone! We just can't leave you like this knowing that you might need help.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's name is Paimon, and this is (Traveler). Might we know your name?
:'''Varsha:''' My name's Varsha...
:'''Paimon:''' And why are you here all alone, Varsha? We can escort you back if you're lost.
:'''Varsha:''' No. The past should stay in the past. I've decided to move on.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Varsha:''' I can't rely on adults. I must go my own way...
:'''Paimon:''' What's with this old-person talk...? You are just a kid! Anyway, the forest can be pretty dangerous. A kid like you isn't gonna be able to handle it.
:'''Varsha:''' Some bad guy tried to take me away earlier... But it's okay. I'm more careful now. I'll be able to avoid danger.
:'''Varsha:''' He was a guy from [[Vimara Village]], and he looked nice enough. But as it turns out, he was no different from those adults I met before...
:'''Paimon:''' You almost got taken away by some bad guy!? You haven't learned your lesson at all, then! Wait, and how did you manage to get away last time, anyway?
:'''Varsha:''' Some small creature whisked me to this place. I've never seen something this small in [[Gandharva Ville]], so I believe that it had to be a forest spirit.
;(If [[The Viparyas of Vanarana]] has not been completed)
::{{DIcon}} (It could be an Aranara.)
;(If The Viparyas of Vanarana has already been completed)
::{{DIcon}} (That should be an Aranara.)
:'''Paimon:''' (That said, could "that guy from Vimara Village" refer to...)
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, it's still not safe for kids to be alone in the forest. You might encounter all kinds of dangers, like...
:{{DIcon}} Running into dangerous Fungi.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! And villains such as Nara Marana. Ugh, no, Paimon meant to say...
:{{DIcon}} You might run into bad guys that might try to kidnap you.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! What (Traveler) said! Or... or you might starve!
:'''Varsha:''' It's impossible to starve in a forest full of nature's gifts. [[Starshroom]]s, [[Sweet Flower]]s, and [[Mint]]s are everywhere, and I eat like a bird anyway.
:'''Varsha:''' And I've always been pretty good at taking care of plants, so finding a safe place to plant some Sweet Flowers or Mints to feed myself won't be a problem.
:'''Varsha:''' Haha, a garden full of Sweet Flowers... Wouldn't that be paradise?
;(If the Sweet Flowers have not been encountered from The Viparyas of Vanarana quest)
::'''Paimon:''' What a sweet daydream she's having, eh...
::'''Varsha:''' Anyway, I am much happier now than when I was in Gandharva Ville, and I don't get beaten... I appreciate your kindness. But right now, it'd be for the best if you left me alone...
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon doesn't know what she's been through, but it seems like it would be hard to convince her to return.
::'''Paimon:''' To be fair, things don't look too dangerous around here... Let's come back and see her later if chance allows. Maybe she'll have changed her mind by then.

:;(Talk to Varsha prior to completing Viparyas of Vanarana)
::'''Varsha:''' As long as there are seeds, I can grow more Sweet Flowers. But bread is different. You can't plant bread.
::'''Varsha:''' If bread could break in half and grow back again, no one would ever go hungry...

:;(Talk to Varsha after completing The Viparyas of Vanarana)
::'''Paimon:''' Hi Varsha! You're still here, huh?
::'''Varsha:''' Paimon. (Traveler). Good to see you. I'm doing well here. There's nothing for you to worry about.
::'''Paimon:''' You've persevered, huh...
::'''Varsha:''' Are you still trying to persuade me? I'm not going anywhere with you. Not at all...
::'''Paimon:''' Well... we're not gonna force you to do anything. Remember what you said about "a garden full of Sweet Flowers"?
::'''Varsha:''' Ah... It was a wishful thinking actually. I know there isn't such a place.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... This maturity still feels weird coming from a kid.
::'''Paimon:''' Guess what? We've got good news!
::{{DIcon}} There really is a garden full of Sweet Flowers.
::'''Paimon:''' Yes! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called Aranara.
::'''Paimon:''' We know this, 'cause we've helped plant many Viparyas for them.
::{{DIcon}} We helped the earth to remember.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. According to Aranakula, Vanarana remembers everything, so the Viparyas can sprout in the garden once the land remembers them again.
::'''Varsha:''' ...I've heard a lot of stories like this before, and only kids take them seriously. But I know you said this with good intentions, Paimon, so thank you.
::'''Paimon:''' Aren't you a kid as well? And Paimon's not telling stories. Paimon means it for real!
::'''Varsha:''' Yeah. That's what every storyteller says.
::'''Paimon:''' If you don't believe us... Well, seeing is believing! Come with us and see for yourself!
::'''Varsha:''' Wait, you've really prepared a place to fit your story? Now I'm getting curious.
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, Paimon's telling you the truth...
::'''Paimon:''' Let's take her to the Aranara's garden, (Traveler). That should silence her doubts once and for all.

;(If the Sweet Flowers have already been encountered from The Viparyas of Vanarana quest)
::'''Paimon:''' A garden full of Sweet Flowers, huh... Ooh, Paimon remembers that there were many in the garden we took care of for the Aranara!
::'''Varsha:''' Wait. Are you saying that there really is a paradise like that out there, Paimon?
::'''Paimon:''' Yup! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called the Aranara.
::'''Paimon:''' We know this, 'cause we've helped plant many Viparyas for them.
::{{DIcon}} We helped the earth to remember.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. According to Aranakula, Vanarana remembers everything, so the Viparyas can sprout in the garden once the land remembers them again.
::'''Varsha:''' ...I've heard a lot of stories like this before, and only kids take them seriously. But I know you said this with good intentions, Paimon, so thank you.
::'''Paimon:''' Aren't you a kid as well? And Paimon's not telling stories. Paimon means it for real!
::'''Varsha:''' Yeah. That's what every storyteller says.
::'''Paimon:''' If you don't believe us... Well, seeing is believing! Come with us and see for yourself!
::'''Varsha:''' Wait, you've really prepared a place to fit your story? Now I'm getting curious.
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, Paimon's telling you the truth...
::'''Paimon:''' Let's take her to the Aranara's garden, (Traveler). That should silence her doubts once and for all.
{{Quest Description|There are so many Sweet Flowers in Vanarana's garden now. Varsha would be ecstatic to see it for herself for sure.}}
;(Approaching the garden)
:'''Varsha:''' Wow, there are so many Sweet Flowers!
:'''Paimon:''' Don't run so fast, Varsha!
:'''Varsha:''' The flowers are coming along very well here!
:'''Varsha:''' Come on over, Paimon! You too, (Traveler)!
:'''Paimon:''' Varsha just can't sit still for even a second... Let's go, (Traveler).

;(Approach Varsha)
:'''Varsha:''' Did you prepare all this, Paimon and (Traveler)?
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... Yes and no. It's [[Aranakula]] and [[Arakara]] who tend to this garden together. We just helped out a little on the side. It is not built just for made-up stories.
:'''Varsha:''' Aranakula and Arakara... They are the "Aranara," the forest spirits?
:'''Paimon:''' Yes! You finally believe Paimon now? Not only did we help to take care of the garden, but we also went on adventures with the Aranara!
:'''Paimon:''' The Aranara are the ones who take the kidnapped kids back to Vimara Village.
:'''Varsha:''' It's still hard to believe the stories though... But if I stay here, will I have a chance to see them too?
:'''Paimon:''' Vanarana is not actually dangerous, but are you sure you don't want to go back to Gandharva Ville?
:'''Varsha:''' You have a memory like a sieve, Paimon. I said I couldn't rely on adults and that I want to go my own way.
:{{DIcon}} But...
:'''Varsha:''' Alright, don't worry about me. I've manage to live on my own so far, remember?
:'''Varsha:''' And I am a great caretaker of plants. The Aranara would be happy to see the garden flourishing here!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, if you insist...
:'''Varsha:''' You're such a worrywart, Paimon. No one has cared about me this much for as long as I can remember.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Listen here, Varsha, you are safe here in Vanarana. But you are still a kid, so please take care of yourself.
:'''Varsha:''' I know, I know. You two take care as well!

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Varsha, optional)
:'''Varsha:''' (Aranara... hehe.)
