==Gameplay Notes==
* For steps 4 to 7, the party will be limited to the Traveler, Xiao, Chongyun, and Diona. [[Co-Op Mode]] will be disabled.
* For steps 10 to 14, the party will be limited to Xingqiu and Mika. Co-Op Mode will be disabled.
* For step 15, Noelle will join the current party.
* Depending on the current attributes of the player's characters, either a trial character or the player's version of the character is used.
** The criteria for the trial character to be replaced with the player's character is unclear. Characters with lower levels, lower artifact levels, and lower weapon levels than the trial can replace the trial, so having higher stats than the trial character in all aspects is not necessary.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You take a stroll while taking in the scenery for poetic inspiration. As you share your verses with each other, there seems to be a faint sense of sorrow admist the joyful laughter...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo sgeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like it's about time to head over to the venue again.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's still curious what Chongyun saw the other day.

;(Approach the stage at the event venue)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, everyone got here so early.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The sun is shining bright today! As soon as that leaf floats past Stone Gate, we shall reveal today's poetry theme!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' The theme of the second day of the "Neighboring Nations Congenial Poetry Gala" is... Pairing couplets!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' (Pairing couplets? I've heard of that &mdash; it's a Liyue art form where you have to create new lines of poetry based on fixed rules. Kind of like... a fill-in-the-blanks game, but for poetry?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Heaven and earth, rain and wind, the endless sky and the boundless land. [[Forest Boar|Forest boars]] and ocean shrimp, [[Lavender Melon]]s and [[Matsutake]] 'shrooms!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Based on a given line of poetry, you must create the second line to form a pair, or "couplet"! As long as you take inspiration from the wide world around you, you'll find it's not so difficult after all.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' The two lines should be neatly matched, complementing each other both semantically and rhythmically. In essence, it's just like most other forms of poetry.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' To buoy your imaginations and allow the winds of inspiration to fill your sails, we've added an additional component: a nature tour!<ref group="Note">Instead of "a nature tour," the voice line says "an inspiration walk!"</ref>
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' (...An "inspiration walk"?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' By inspiration walk, we simply mean wandering around in the wild, taking in the scenery, and pocketing any poetic thoughts.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Of course, to all our friends, old and new, please be careful while out and about. [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]] is already fully booked for the month ahead, and if there's any more demand, I'll be the only one with a smile on my face.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' In short, please roam freely as the mood takes you, enjoy the spectacular scenery of our two beautiful nations, and fill your imaginations with the most pleasing of poetry! We will all reconvene here tonight.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' {{Traveler}}, can you round up Xingqiu, Chongyun, and the Mondstadt contingent? I have a favor to ask of you.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, is it that thing from yesterday?
:{{DIcon}} No problem.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe, thanks, I'm counting on you!
:{{Black Screen|You gather the team, and briefly describe what's really going on...}}
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' So, we hope that each of you can keep an eye out for this while you're out on your inspiration walk.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Are you sure this is okay? It was just something I ran into, and now we're imposing my business on everyone else...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Please don't say that, Mr. Chongyun. Master [[Jean]] ordered us to work with you however we can to improve cooperation. Helping each other out is exactly what we're here for.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Besides, investigating any strange occurrences near Mondstadt and making a report to the Knights of Favonius is also part of our job.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I don't mind either. 'Cause while we're out, I can look for new cocktail ingredients too.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, just think of it like an outing with friends. It'll be fun!
:{{DIcon}} No need to feel bad.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' The way I see it, you should just humbly accept their willingness to help.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Alright, in that case, thank you all very much. I will be sure to repay your kindness some day.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Now, how about we split into two groups for the day?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' You mean, to cover more ground?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Not just that. Don't forget, this is still part of the poetry gala!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' If we all see the same sights and sounds during our inspiration walk, how can we write unique poems?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' That's true... but how do we decide who goes in which group?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Why don't we draw lots?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Hehe, that'll make things even more fun.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' (Drawing lots!? But what if I end up with the Liyue crowd, and I can't think of anything to say to them?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I've got the slips of paper here. Who wants to go first?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon! Paimon wants to go first!
:{{Black Screen|Everyone draws a lot...}}
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 venti 12.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Okay, so that's {{Traveler}}, Paimon, Diona, and Chongyun in one group, and Xingqiu, Mika, and Noelle in the other.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 mika 05.ogg}} '''Mika:''' (What a relief... at least I'll have Noelle with me...)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Then I humbly place myself at your instruction.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 mika 06.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Oh... Uh, I don't think... That won't be...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I also await your guidance.
:{{DIcon}} No need to be so formal, man.
:{{DIcon}} Taking a stroll, that's the plan.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Take care, everyone. See you all tonight!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Did anyone forget to bring anything? If not, then let's get going! C'mon!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Wow... are those ears and tail real? So fluffy...)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Alright. Miss Diona, is there someplace in particular you would like to go?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 2 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Just call me Diona! Since we're trying to find that thing you saw, why don't we start with the place you saw it last time?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go get inspired.
::{{A|vo sgeq002 2 chongyun 07a 1.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Sure. Then, everyone follow me.
:{{DIcon}} Lead the way, Captain Chongyun.
::{{A|vo sgeq002 2 chongyun 07b 1.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Captain? Hey, quit messing around.

;(Talk to Venti again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq002 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Enjoy your inspiration walks! I'm looking forward to some splendid poetry tonight.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Right over there, next to the water. That's where I saw it. But it was a little foggy at the time, so I didn't get a clear look.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uhh... The view from here's great, but there's kind of a gloomy atmosphere around here. Is this the kind of place you like to take a walk?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I wasn't taking a walk. I come here to train.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Train? Like how knights train for combat?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Um, it's a bit different. As an exorcist of Liyue, my training involves practising techniques for the exorcism of evil spirits.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Exorcism?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I've always wanted to demonstrate the power of exorcism, but... it's a pity, I've never actually gotten the chance.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chongyun is one-in-a-million: He has a pure-yang spirit! So, as soon as he gets close, evil spirits run and hide!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Huh? Isn't that a good thing?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It's awful! Have you ever heard of an exorcist that's never seen an evil spirit? A lot of people think I'm a fraud because of this condition of mine.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Your physical constitution is far rarer than the techniques still passed down by exorcists today. You should treasure it.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Conqueror of Demons?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Is that a friend of yours?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! This is Xiao, an [[Adeptus]] of Liyue!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' (An adeptus? Wow! I've never seen one of those before!)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uh... Hello, Mr. Adeptus.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Just call me Xiao.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Sooo... are you here to train too? Or are you out for an inspiration walk?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...When I heard about the exorcist's encounter, my suspicions were roused. That's why I'm here.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I've already informed the owner of the inn. If you see anything out of the ordinary, return immediately and leave it to me.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I, um... aw, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to drag even the Conqueror of Demons into this...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I have already patrolled the area and found nothing amiss. Either the anomaly you encountered was no evil spirit, or perhaps it already left.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I guess that means we came all this way for nothing...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' If there's no other business, I'll be taking my leave now.
:{{DIcon}} ...Wait!
:{{DIcon}} Come on an inspiration walk with us!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ....
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, you should come! There's no one else around here anyway, so you don't need to worry.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' But...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I would also be honored if you joined us, Adeptus Xiao. It is a rare opportunity, and... I have many questions about exorcising evil spirits that I would like to ask you.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Fine.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' (Seems like this adeptus is pretty shy... or maybe all the adepti in Liyue are like this?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Team Chongyun has a new member, yay!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Wh&mdash;What? When did this become my team? Now that Adeptus Xiao is joining us, if anyone's team leader, it should be&mdash;
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't overthink it! Diona, didn't you say you wanted to find some new ingredients?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 10.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Yeah. I don't get to come to Liyue very often, so I wanna gather some new ingredients while I'm here!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 11.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I've heard that Liyue's Jueyun Chilis can set your throat on fire! Is that true? I'm gonna mix them into my drinks and give it a try!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 11.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Huh? Jueyun Chilis?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 12.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Um... I'm not sure that would taste very good...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 diona 12.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Really? Purrfect! Let's go pick a whole bunch of 'em!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 4 chongyun 13.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' What the...?

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 5 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' As well as Jueyun Chilis, I also need some [[Slime Condensate]] or [[Loach Pearl]]s.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 5 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Are those really fit for human consumption? This is starting to sound like something [[Xiangling]] would make...

;(Approach Diona after defeating the slimes)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Okay, this should be enough!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...Diona, you seem really committed to, uh... making alcoholic drinks available to people of all tastes.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' What!? No! Never! I HATE alcohol!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' When grown-ups drink too much, they get that stupid drunk look on their faces, can't speak clearly, and don't even respond properly! Sometimes they just sleep on the floor all night! Alcohol is the root of all kinds of evil...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' So I'm on a mission to mix the most disgusting drink in the whole world, and show everyone just how awful alcohol really is! Nothing can stand in my way &mdash; if it means coming out to Liyue every day to pick fresh Jueyun Chilis, then so be it, hmph!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Um... Is it really worth all that effort?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uh, yeah! 'Cause all my previous efforts have failed... Those stinkin' boozehounds not only haven't woken up to the truth of how bad alcohol is, they even keep praising my drinks! It makes me FURIOUS!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But... how is that possible? If this is the kind of stuff you're throwing into their drinks, it must taste absolutely vile, surely?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Are you calling me a liar!? Well, if you don't believe me, I'll fix you a drink right now, then you'll see!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Huh? Uh, no... no need, I...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph! Just you wait.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Oh no, is she really going to add those Jueyun Chilis?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...If her claims are true, perhaps she, too, possesses a unique constitution of some kind?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I don't see how it could have anything to do with her. Unless... she's under the influence of some kind of power? Maybe an evil spirit?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' No. I sense no trace of the demonic in her &mdash; although there are traces of something else. Something rather special.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' In Liyue, we might say this child has adeptal affinity.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' It's ready. Here, I made one for Xiao too.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Oh boy, look at that color... Yep, she definitely added Jueyun Chilis.)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' What's wrong? You're not allergic to anything, are you?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 10.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Don't worry, there isn't even any alcohol in it. It's a Slime Condensate base with a seasoning of Jueyun Chilis and finished with frog legs.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Surely, there's no way this can possibly taste good...)
:{{DIcon}} Don't force yourselves.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Xiao downed it in a single gulp! Ugh, great... If the Conqueror of Demons drank it, it'd be rude of me to refuse...)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chongyun drank his too! Is he gonna be okay?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' This drink is...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 11.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...Delicious!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 12.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It does have a touch of Jueyun Chili, but it isn't at all overpowering! It's completely different from Xiangling's cooking or those drinks Xingqiu makes to mess with me!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 13.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It's crisp and refreshing, with just a hint of numbness, and the Jueyun Chili flavor combines with the smooth but not slimy texture of the frog legs to form a heavenly mixture!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 14.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' And oh, the Slimes! Can we talk about the Slimes!? Before this, I never knew that they had such a pure and herby taste, like... fresh grass after the rain! The power and purity of nature, distilled into a cup! Amazing! Simply unbelievable!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! Slimes are absolutely sublime!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 11.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Ugh, I failed again... But wait... What's gotten into Chongyun? He's been so quiet up until now...
:{{DIcon}} Are you okay?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 15.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I'm great! And I gotta try another &mdash; Diona, if you please, one more!
:{{Black Screen|At your instruction, Diona serves Chongyun with an ice-cold drink...}}
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 16.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I... *panting*&nbsp;...Okay, I think I've calmed down a bit.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 17.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I'm sorry, I can't believe I let you all see me like that.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 12.ogg}} '''Diona:''' It's fine. My fault for not checking your spice tolerance first.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 diona 13.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Looks like this "pure-yang spirit" isn't such a great thing to have after all.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 18.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Actually... before I drank it, I very much doubted what you said about your drinks...
:{{A|vo sgeq001 19 together 03.ogg}} '''Diona & Chongyun:''' *sigh*
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who'd have thought it... Diona and Chongyun are actually kinda similar.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Hm?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiao, what's wrong?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Look over there.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 chongyun 20.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' You mean the leaf?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Something's written on it.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You can see that from over here?
:{{DIcon}} Let's grab it and take a look.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah! Or it'll get swept away!

;(Interact with the leaf)
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Pick up fallen leaf
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' There's a poem written on it. The Conqueror of Demons has truly amazing vision...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see...
::'''Poem on Fallen Leaf'''
::The sky that night blossomed with flowers,
::The stars that night hummed like bees,
::In search of nectar and of dreams.
::And we, that night, were as new as the dew,
::Under moonlight flowing like silken honey,
::Our words sweet as we sat by the spring.
::But I turned and left you alone,
::The poem in my heart left unspoken.
::And since then,
::The stars do not twinkle, the moon is ice-cold.
::I hide them 'neath the water,
::But your tears fall and find them.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... It sounds like the author is writing about the first time they met their true love...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Although the following lines suggest that they didn't end up together.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Why write a poem on a fallen leaf?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The flowing waters are ruthless &mdash; they carry the leaves away with the current. This poem would likely have vanished into the void had we not found it.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...It makes no sense to me.
:{{DIcon}} Sometimes, people write poems simply to express themselves.
:{{DIcon}} It doesn't matter if anyone else reads it.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' That's true. I've heard Xingqiu say something similar before.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' When there's things that you're unable to say, or just never had the chance to say before it was too late... If it can be put on paper, it can be expressed as poetry.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Is it kinda like wishing at a fountain? I used to do that sometimes when I was little.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... That means that our mystery poet was probably hoping that someone would read it, right?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' You think? Then... Should we write a poem in reply?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But we don't know who wrote it. How can we reply?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Why not go upstream?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Upstream? Why?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The ink looks fresh. It can't have been written too long ago.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' This withered leaf floated down with the current. If we travel further upstream and drop a leaf into the same waters, it should be carried down past the original writer.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool! Ah, this is so romantic &mdash; communicating with a mystery person using poems on fallen leaves!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But how do we make sure that they'll receive it?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' We can write extra copies and drop the leaves in different places! As they say, where there's a will, there's a way. Surely at least one of our leaves will find a path?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Either way, it's our only option.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then let's make like a tree and head upstream!

;(Approach the location upstream)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Upstream, upstream, up we go~! Oh, did you think of what to write yet?
:{{DIcon}} I already finished writing it.
::'''Response Poem on a Leaf'''
::Amidst the dark, fireflies aglow,
::Pebbles unmoved by the stream's flow,
::If words yet remain, and love holds to the last,
::Against the world can the small stand fast.
::In honeyed moonlight may you once more bask.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Now give it here, and Paimon'll toss it on the water!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...This was a great suggestion, Xiao.
:{{DIcon}} Seems like the idea of getting involved has grown on you.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ..."Things you never had the chance to say before it was too late"... When silence is the final word, we mourn the loss of things unheard...
:{{DIcon}} You should try writing a poem too, Xiao.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I have little talent for nor knowledge of poetry...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The leaf's in the water! Look, it's like a little boat. Merrily, merrily down the stream, life is but a dream!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' We should probably pick up the pace. We still have a few more leaves to set afloat, and we need to get back before it gets dark.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, let's gooo... Huh?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's this? You two having a private chat?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...No, it's nothing.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 8 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I just hope this isn't all in vain.
:{{Black Screen|Some time ago, in a team far, far away...}}
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Ah, the scenery here is quite beautiful. Let's pause here to seek some inspiration.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Should we set up camp? Please wait a moment, I'll pitch the tent.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It's an inspiration "walk," there's no need for all that...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Okay, well I'll conduct reconnaissance nearby to ensure this area is safe, and see if I can't scavenge any firewood or food while I'm at it.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Wait... reconnaissance?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' It means survey the environment and plan our route forward. It's the foundation of all operations while out in the wild.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' (Are all inspiration walks in Mondstadt this complicated...?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' (They're acting like this is completely normal... am I the weirdo here?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' In that case, I'll "conduct reconnaissance" with Mika.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Huh? Oh... okay then.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' (Crumbs, now I have to try and make small talk... Should I mention the scenery? The weather?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 9 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Very well, then leave the camp to me!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 11 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' So, Xingqiu... Uh, d&mdash;do you, um, go on inspiration walks often, or...?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 11 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I do. I always get bored when I'm cooped up at home, so I head out for a stroll.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 11 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Life gets busy. You have to steal a moment of leisure when you can.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 11 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Cool... Oh! Over there! Firewood!

;(Talk to Noelle again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq002 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Have fun, you two. I'll have the tent set up soon.

;(Approach the marked location after collecting the [[Fresh Berries]])
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' With this wood and the food I brought along, we can definitely put together a decent lunch.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' You've got quite a knack for wilderness survival, I'll give you that.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Thanks! I... I was on an expedition with the Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius for a while not too long ago. I was in charge of surveying and mapping.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh? You sound like a character from an adventure novel, charging across the world, sword in hand!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Wha...? No, I'm nowhere near as amazing as all that...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' If I really run into a powerful enemy, I always leave it for someone stronger to deal with...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' You're too modest, Mika. A hero is measured not by the blood on his sword, but by what's in his heart.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' As long as a righteous heart that yearns to aid others beats within your chest, no matter where you go, or what you have achieved, you may be called a "hero."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 mika 05.ogg}} '''Mika:''' (That all sounded pretty profound... I've never even thought about any of that before.)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Hello? Are you okay? Maybe we should return, lest Noelle be forced to wait on us.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 12 mika 07.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Oh, sure.
----
;(Approach Noelle at the camp)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' You're back! Did everything go smoothly? Do you need a cloth to wipe the sweat from your brow?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' No need, thanks. All clear. There's no danger in the vicinity.
:{{Black Screen|The team lights a fire and starts preparing lunch.}}
:{{Black Screen|Before long, a delicious meal is ready.}}
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Noelle, your cooking is amazing! Every single dish is so tasty.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Truly astounding, I never imagined it was possible to enjoy such a satisfying meal in the great outdoors.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Really? Then what do you usually eat when you're out on an inspiration walk?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh, well, since I usually sneak out from home, I just grab some dried snacks to take with me. Add in whatever fruit I pick along the way, and that's my lunch.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' By sneaking out, you mean... running away from home?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' That's right! Or sometimes, I'll tell a cover story, like... I'm going out to take care of business.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' But... if you get caught, won't you get disciplined?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' So just don't get caught!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Anyway, did anything interesting come up while you were out scouting?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 mika 05.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Well, Xingqiu and I talked about what it means to be a "hero."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 mika 06.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Now that I think about it, by Xingqiu's definition, you should be considered a hero too, Noelle!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Huh? Me?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 mika 07.ogg}} '''Mika:''' You're always happy to help everyone in the Knights of Favonius. Not only that, but whenever we're out training, you help out the citizens of Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 mika 08.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Remember that time when a giant boulder was blocking the road? You cut it in two with a single blow!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh? It appears that not only does she have a heroic spirit, but also incredible martial prowess.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Don't... Please don't praise me like that!&nbsp;...We should talk about what we came here to do: finding inspiration.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 mika 09.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Miss Hu Tao said something about pocketing our... poetic thoughts. But so far all we've done is gather some firewood and cook lunch. I have no idea what to write...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' You can write about anything.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Looking at [[Cor Lapis]], one can't help but wonder if one's own heart is as bright and clear as jade. Observing silk, so bright and beautiful, one pauses to consider whether it ever feels the sadness and sorrow that humans do.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 08.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' So, we have to connect our internal world with the external one?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Exactly! But that's just one of many possible methods.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Perhaps you might gaze out at the bridge in the distance, and see a [[Callirhoe|woman]] leaning on the railing, looking as if her heart is laden by sorrows that even the rushing waters below cannot wash away...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 09.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Huh? Wait, I saw her at the gala yesterday. She wrote one of the riddles we answered.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 13 noelle 10.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Why don't we go say hi?

;(Approach the woman on the bridge)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Hello, Ma'am. How fortuitous it is that we meet again.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 kallirhoe 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hello. Are you here on your inspiration walk too?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Yes. Allow me to introduce ourselves: I am Xingqiu, and this is Noelle and Mika.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Thank you for accepting our answer to your riddle yesterday.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 kallirhoe 02.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Oh, don't mention it. It's all in good fun. I'm Callirhoe.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' ...So, Miss Callirhoe, are you from [[Fontaine]]?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 kallirhoe 03.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' That's right! I was traveling in the area, and just happened to see there was a poetry event being held at Stone Gate. It looked fun, so I thought I'd drop in.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Your riddle yesterday made quite an impression on me. It was uniquely evocative. Have you studied Liyue poetry before?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 kallirhoe 04.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I haven't, actually. I've just picked up a few things here and there from chatting with people throughout my travels.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Amazing! So you're a natural poet!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' We noticed you standing on the bridge from quite some distance away. Are you drawing poetic inspiration from the flowing current beneath your feet?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 kallirhoe 05.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Haha, I haven't finished my poem yet. The water here was just so peaceful and calming, I stopped for a moment and lost myself in admiring it...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Well, since we're all here, why not head back with us to the venue for tonight's festivities? It's getting late, after all.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 kallirhoe 06.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Huh? Are... Are you sure?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' We can walk and talk. Perhaps the mingling of ideas will give rise to new inspiration.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I'd personally like to hear Miss Callirhoe's couplet. I'm sure I can learn something.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 14 kallirhoe 07.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Haha, well if you're all in agreement, I've got no reason not to join you.

:{{Black Screen|The group walk back to the venue, laughing and joking as they go.}}
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Woohoo, the first team is back, right on schedule!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Huh? The others have yet to return?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...C'mon, let's hurry!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' *wheezing* We... *panting*&nbsp;...We're not too late, are we?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Just how far did you all go?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, everyone catch your breath... Come on, deep breaths, one... two. Now don't panic, the party hasn't started yet!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... We made it... Paimon's exhausted...
:{{DIcon}} Since when do you get tired from flying...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon gets tired if she has to fly too fast!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not to mention dropping all those leaves. Paimon's hands are cramping up...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph! Sounds like someone needs to exercise more.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You guys picked up a new teammate while you were out?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Indeed. This is Callirhoe &mdash; I believe you'll remember her from yesterday, though you weren't introduced.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 kallirhoe 01.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Hi everyone.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello! But you're not the only ones who called in reinforcements! Hee-hee, look who we got...

:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' XIAOOOOOO! Come on oooout~!

:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hohoho, they say roosters crow at first light, and finches go to bed at night, but Director Hu Tao's always on the ball &mdash; anytime, anywhere, she'll answer your call!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Are the theatrics really necessary? We're already on day two of the festival. The opening ceremony is over...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh ho, but my dear dear Paimon, it seems you are not yet aware. That was not for my own sake, but for a special guest who is joining us today&mdash;
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''[[Zhongli]]:''' Director Hu's manner is as exuberant as ever. It always makes quite an impression.

:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Mr. Zhongli, I hope you are well.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Xingqiu... What can you tell me about Mister Zhongli? He seems like somebody very important.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Yes &mdash; he's held in very high regard in Liyue Harbor. He's extremely erudite in many different domains of knowledge.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Allow me to introduce you all to Zhongli, a consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' His expertise is limitless, stretching from the celestial orbs to the terrestrial ores, spanning modern and ancient culture, delving into literature both prosaic and poetic.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' He may be my subordinate, but he is certainly a qualified poetry expert. And so, we have invited him here tonight to judge the compositions.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The director exaggerates. I am but vaguely acquainted with a few lines of classical poetry. Should you consider me to be remiss in my appraisal of your own compositions, please correct me.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Aiya, enough with the modesty already! If I didn't know better, I'd say you seemed nervous. Just focus on judging.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Please rest assured that I shall rise to the occasion, Director.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Let me do a quick count... one, two, three, four... Great, equal numbers on both sides.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Huh? Are you counting me, too?
:{{DIcon}} Join us.
:{{DIcon}} It'll be fun.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Okay, fine... But consider this a favor!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hmm, with our Fontaine friend present, perhaps we should rename this event to the "Three Nations Congenial Poetry Gala"...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Also, I'm just noticing that Paimon should only count as a half-teammate at most...? Hmm, that kinda puts Team {{Traveler}} at a bit of a disadvantage...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 10.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Well, how about this: I'll join in as well! Director Hu Tao, here to help out in your hour of greatest need! What does everyone think?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Naturally, the more the merrier. Being the host of the festival shouldn't stop you from having the chance to enjoy it like the rest of us.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 11.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Then it's settled! Everyone else in the audience, feel free to join in too, and support your favorite team!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' What about me? Shall I keep track of the score?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 12.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' No need for that! The teams are just a formality. We're all friends here, and this isn't intended to be competitive. But what do you think, Judge Zhongli?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I concur, Director. Moreover, it would be disingenuous to impose upon our friends from Mondstadt and Fontaine a competition in which they are judged on how rigorously they can adhere to Liyue poetic conventions.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Since this is a "Congenial Poetry Gala," should we not begin with inspiration and finish with friendly conversation? The aim being for all participants to enjoy themselves.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Phew, that's a relief... I was so nervous about this, but it sounds like it's gonna be pretty relaxed...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 13.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Couldn't have asked for a better judge &mdash; Zhongli said everything I was supposed to say, only far more eloquently. So without further ado... I shall pass the baton to Venti.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' No problem.
----
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Friends old and new, put on your thinking caps and take a deep breath of fresh air! The second stage of our poetry gala will now commence: matching couplets!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Perhaps I could break the ice with a humble contribution to inspire others to share their brilliance.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Please listen to the first line in the couplet: "Lounging in luxury inside a [[Xinyue Kiosk]] booth, delighting in countless contemporary tastes."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' (What? He managed to think of one already? He seems like a real expert at this...)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Xinyue Kiosk... Should that be paired with [[Liuli Pavilion]]? Or are they too similar for a couplet? Ugh, this is pretty difficult!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Xinyue Kiosk... contemporary tastes... Hmm, I guess I should pair the modernity of their VIP dining experience with an emblem of the past... Ah! Maybe where I was training that one time? That was quite ancient. The weather was terrible that day...)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...Okay! I got something!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ..."Surrounded by history outside a Tianheng Pass pavilion, as lightning sets the boundless tenebrous skies ablaze."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Chongyun completed the couplet!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hmm... Xinyue Kiosk is a renowned modern restaurant, while the mountain pass of Tianheng is a prominent historical landmark. These two iconic locations form a complementary pair.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The imagery also contrasts rather well between the two halves of the couplet, one half describing a leisurely and comfortable indoor scene, the other portraying a hazardous outdoor scenario where there is no protection from the elements.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Huh? I was just describing what I experienced that day... I guess I just got lucky?)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Alright then, I guess I'll start the next couplet:
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' "Mind pines for [[Mingyun Village|Mingyun]], flesh confined to [[Qingce Village|Qingce]], spirit striding high on [[Jueyun Karst|Jueyun]]'s clouds."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' (Oh, Chongyun, you dark horse... Looks like you came to play today...)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This conjures the image of one with lofty aspirations, whose life is limited to a small town, but who awaits the opportunity to one day ascend above the clouds. The use of various locations for their symbolism is quite novel indeed.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' ...Oh!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' "Soul shines like jadestone, dressed in finest silkwear, lucent heart still beats within me now."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, how did Noelle do that!?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' A superb line. It employs the metaphor of precious stone to describe one of noble and moral character, with a pure and clear heart. The symbolism in this case is centered around objects. Truly, the work of a skilled poet.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' That was a commendable couplet.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' All thanks to your guidance while we were out on our inspiration walk.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 kallirhoe 02.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I'd like to start the next couplet:
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 kallirhoe 03.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' "Up into the misty karst, down among the grassy marsh, all for [[Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup]]."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' ...Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it, Diona? Did you think of a second line for the couplet?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' No, everyone's poems are so complicated. I need more time just to understand them...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But when I heard "Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup," it made me think of [[Berry & Mint Burst|Berry and Mint Burst]]... maybe because I mixed a similar drink recently.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} ...Got it!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo sgeq002 15 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' "North beyond the [[Starfell Lake]], south across the windswept plains, just for berries squeezed and mint infused."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 kallirhoe 04.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' No wonder everyone praises {{Traveler}} so highly! You answered so quickly.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Both halves of this couplet require intimate knowledge of the terrain in question and the local plants that may be found there. The two of you are clearly both seasoned travelers.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Does this mean I helped? Meowza!
:{{DIcon}} You saved the day.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Diona.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 14.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hey now, Zhongli, don't just praise everything you hear! You should question and press them a bit, don't worry about upsetting anyone! After all, I'm here to take the heat!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 kallirhoe 05.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Then allow me to try another:
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 kallirhoe 06.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' "[[Qingxin|'Qingxin']] has no heart, still it soothes the human heart."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Is she talking about the medicinal effects of Qingxin? Hmm... this is a hard one to match.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...The "xin" part of Qingxin means heart, but the flower itself has no heart...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ...
:;(The Traveler gazes at Xiao on an overlooking mountain)
:{{DIcon}} ...!
:{{DIcon}} I've got it!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hero 02.ogg}} {{A|vo sgeq002 15 heroine 02.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' "[["Sweet Dream"|'Sweet Dream']] is no dream, yet it nurtures people's dreams."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 huanxi 01.ogg}} '''Huanxi:''' Sweet dream? Does that really match?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hmm. Since the suitability of the match has been queried, I shall act according to the Director's wishes, and ask you: What is the link between "Sweet Dream" and "Qingxin"?
:{{DIcon}} "Sweet Dream" is a type of [[Almond Tofu|dessert]].
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhh! You mean eating a delicious dessert before bed will make you sleep well, right? You're amazing!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Actually, we sleep peacefully at night because Xiao is there to protect everyone.)
:;(Xiao smiles then disappears)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Haha, then I agree, the two halves of the couplet match. This point is well deserved.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 15.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Points for me, points for thee, this judge gives out points for free...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 16.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' But if you ask me, everyone's being a little too conventional so far. Let's push the envelope a little! Go nuts!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 11.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh? In that case, why don't you finish this one for me, Hu Tao?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 12.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' "Round moon in the heavens: full moon at night, celebrate with circle of friends."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 17.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' "Square meals in the basement: big bowls of rice, decorate with cuboids of meat."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 13.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Huh? Wh&mdash;What the...?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, we have ourselves a "pedants' couplet."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The two halves have no thematic connection... Yet each word has its perfect parallel, meaning the two halves do form a cohesive whole. The strict pairings make this no easier to achieve than a thematically coherent couplet.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 18.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Blah blah blah! So verbose. Zhongli, just tell me if I got a point or not.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Of course, you did. I presumed it went without saying.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 14.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Ahem... "Through [[Qiongji Estuary|Qiongji]] I walked a hundred miles, at [[Guili Plains|Guili]] I ended my march. In [[Dihua Marsh|Dihua]] the silvergrass grows in two styles, but [[horsetail]]s don't trot out the marsh."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 19.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' "From vendors I bought some fifteen steaks, at dinner I sizzled the lot. At pressure the tenderloin cooks in two ticks, but fifteen won't fit in the pot."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 xingqiu 15.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's a "pedants' couplet"? Paimon thinks she can do that too!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I thought of one!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' "[[Wolfhook]]s can't hook [[Baron Bunny]]."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, that's a cute couplet!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 levin 01.ogg}} '''Levin:''' "[[Sweet Flower]]s can't outsweet Sister [[Barbara]]!"
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, now that's the passion we like to see, although... unfortunately, your response was technically one word too long.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' In that case... "[[Whopperflower]]s can't whop [[Jumpy Dumpty]]."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 20.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oho! This Mondstadter's got talent!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 mika 05.ogg}} '''Mika:''' (Phew... I'm so relieved I at least managed to get one...)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' "Nestling by a roaring fire, scent of tea wafts from the stove, reading through the [[Heart of Clear Springs]]."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 kallirhoe 07.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Noelle came up with another one!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, match the couplet! Paimon knows you can do it!
:{{DIcon}} ...Why don't you try it, Paimon?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh!? Do you really think Paimon has what it takes...?
:{{DIcon}} Time to get pedantic.
:{{DIcon}} Match each word, one by one, and you'll be fine.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fine, Paimon'll give it a whirl...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Nestling by a roaring fire, scent of tea wafts from the stove, reading through the Heart of Clear Springs."
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... "Seething in the pouring rain, sword of pain swipes at my foe, beating up the [[Eye of the Storm]]!"
:{{DIcon}} Great job!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? Really?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 hutao 21.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Yes, very good!!! The image of challenging powerful foes in the harshest of conditions seemed to manifest before my eyes, and it was perfectly juxtaposed against the atmosphere of leisurely reading with a cup of freshly brewed tea.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Really? Hehe... Maybe Paimon has a knack for this after all!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 15 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...It appears that my services as a judge are no longer needed.
:{{Black Screen|In high spirits, the laughter and couplets continue late into the night...}}
:{{Black Screen|As the host declares the day's events over, the crowd reluctantly disperses...}}
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woohoo, Paimon's so happy! Paimon managed to match a bunch of couplets at the end! You did hear them all, right?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I really enjoyed myself too! I never knew Liyue's couplet poetry was so much fun.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were amazing today, Noelle! You did so many couplets.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon especially liked your one about reading "Heart of Clear Springs." Paimon never could've thought of that!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 kallirhoe 01.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Callirhoe?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Miss Callirhoe, are you okay? You look like you're getting tired.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 kallirhoe 02.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Don't worry, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 kallirhoe 03.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Although... I do have a question I'd like to ask.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 kallirhoe 04.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Have all of you read "Heart of Clear Springs"?
:{{DIcon}} I've read it before.
:{{DIcon}} I haven't read it yet.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I haven't actually read it.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' My dad told me the story once. It's about a spring fairy and a young boy.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Oh yes, the story of a spring fairy who left her homeland, and met a boy under the moonlight in a faraway land.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' The boy poured out his heart to her, and she listened to his stories.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Over time, the boy grew up, and began to develop feelings for the spring fairy. But the spring fairy didn't understand human love, and was afraid that making a promise to him would ultimately end in tragedy... and so... um...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 noelle 05.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' (I don't know if [[Draff|Diona's father]] mentioned the part about the kiss to her...)
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' In the end, the spring fairy left the boy, and was never heard from again.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 noelle 06.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Ah, yes, that's it! Many years went by, and the boy became an old man, but he never stopped believing that the fairy was real, and not just a dream.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Sounds like a tragic tale...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 kallirhoe 05.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' So, what do you guys think of the spring fairy in the story?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I'm sure she made her decision with the best of intentions, but the boy couldn't hope to understand why she left... It's a shame that the misunderstanding never got cleared up.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 kallirhoe 06.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Well... Do you think she should go back and see that boy again, if she ever had another chance?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now? But... isn't he an old man by the end of the story?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Hmm... isn't it a bit late? What if it just led to more regrets?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Ah! Sorry, maybe I'm being too pessimistic...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If Paimon was that boy... Hmm, actually, Paimon would definitely want to see the spring fairy again. No matter how old Paimon got. After all, she's the love of his life, right?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 kallirhoe 07.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I see...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh? Looks like the party's still going strong over here. Are you coming up with more couplets? Need my help?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Stick to hosting, Tone-Deaf Bard! If you get involved, you'll only match every couplet yourself and not leave any for the rest of us!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, I never knew you had such a high opinion of my abilities, Paimon.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But the couplet games are all over now! Tomorrow's theme is "Freestyle Poetry"!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Do we have to share our own poems with everyone?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' That's right! If you're not feeling confident, don't worry &mdash; it's never too late to register for Venti's Poetry Cram Class.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 noelle 07.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' I'll sign up!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Me too!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, buster... Before you start peddling your classes, just how much freedom is there with this freestyle poetry, exactly? Aren't there any requirements at all?
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' It's as free as the winds that blow, and there's nothing freer! There are no limits to genre, form, content, or anything else. So long as it comes from the heart, you're welcome to put it into poetry.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Give it a try, there's no better chance to express your innermost thoughts!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... That's almost too much freedom! Paimon can't decide which way to go... Our travels? Or maybe all the food that {{Traveler}} has cooked for Paimon...
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Will you come too, Callirhoe? Paimon wants to see what you write!
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 kallirhoe 08.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Oh, um... Yes. I'll be there.
:{{A|vo sgeq002 16 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oof, my nose is starting to itch again... Alright, I shall leave you to privately ponder your poems and bid you all goodnight! See you tomorrow!
