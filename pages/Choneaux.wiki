:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Choneaux:''' Please state your full name and title. The results of our duel will be published in next issue's Genius Invokation TCG column.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Choneaux:''' I lost... Hmm, perhaps it'd be best if this one stayed out of the papers?
:{{DIcon}} I didn't even hear what you said.
::'''Choneaux:''' Phew... Last time, some punk stole my exclusive scoop!
::'''Choneaux:''' That was gonna net me a whole lotta Mora! Once I catch him, I'll make sure to send him to the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
::'''Choneaux:''' It doesn't matter. I already have something new, and this one's gonna belong to me and me alone for sure!
::{{DIcon}} You really care about exclusives...
::'''Choneaux:''' Exclusives mean a big payout. You're not in our line of work, are you?
::'''Choneaux:''' As long as I'm the only one with the scoop, I can negotiate and sell it to the highest bidder.
::'''Choneaux:''' There were even some media folks who came to find me, hoping to buy out my info.
::'''Choneaux:''' They said something about... how it would tarnish their reputation and cause trouble if it got published...
::{{DIcon}} And what did you do?
::'''Choneaux:''' Hahaha! I made a handsome profit off it, that's for sure! But I'm not totally without moral scruples. Once someone buys a story from me, I won't turn around and try to sell it to someone else under a different name.
::'''Choneaux:''' Alright, I've talked enough. I need to think about how to make this report connect with more readers.
:{{DIcon}} ...Bye.
::'''Choneaux:''' How should I revise this report...
