'''Ifa ''' is an upcoming {{Anemo}} character in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Ifa is a renowned [[Saurian]] veterinarian from the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]. He is friends with [[Ororon]] and often delivers vegetables to [[Citlali]] on his behalf.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Whence the Smoke Drifts}}</ref>

When Ororon was avoiding her during his collaboration with [[Capitano]], Citlali asked Ifa to deliver the gem replacement for the talisman that keeps his soul stable. This was actually a ploy to copy Ororon's memories onto the old gem, but Ifa, not knowing anything, agreed to do the delivery without asking any questions.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Flickering Light Splits in Twain}}</ref>

[[Cacucu]] is a [[Qucusaurus]] assistant of Ifa's at his clinic and also considers himself Ifa's "brother." Cacucu learned several of Ifa's catchphrases and despite fully understanding the human language, can only repeat these catchphrases to communicate due to the limited nature of his vocal cords.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|After the Peace}}</ref>
