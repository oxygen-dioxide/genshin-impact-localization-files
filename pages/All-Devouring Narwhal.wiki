Repeated instances of the on-appearance DMG may be reduced down to '''25% ATK''' due to the [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_6      = Eye of Maelstrom
|desc_6      = Summons an Eye of Maelstrom at the center of the arena. The eye will charge as it slowly pulls nearby players in, eventually exploding, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.

|name_7      = Ravaging Devourer
|desc_7      = The narwhal starts the fight with an empty [[Fury]] bar:
* For the first 80 seconds of the fight, it accumulates 1 point of Fury per second.
* After 80 seconds, it will accumulate 2 points of Fury per second.
* Each time it takes DMG, it will accumulate 1 point of Fury for every 1% Max HP lost.
* When the '''Eye of Maelstrom''' is destroyed, it accumulates 30 points of Fury.
* After the narwhal accumulates '''120''' points of Fury, it will devour the player, causing them to enter its belly and engage in battle with the Dark Shadow.
** Defeating the Dark Shadow will cause the narwhal to lose '''20%''' of its Max HP and paralyze it. All party members will also gain maximum [[Energy]].
** If the player is devoured multiple times, the Dark Shadow will start with half HP from the second time onward.
** Once the narwhal's HP drops below '''20%''' of its Max HP, it will no longer devour the player.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A mysterious and gargantuan creature from another world.|[[Archive]], before {{Quest|Finale}}}}
{{Description|A mysterious and gargantuan creature from another world.<br>Poets often liken the starry sky to the ocean. They've seen or dreamt of countless bioluminescent plankton floating on a moonless sea, resembling a galaxy, or the moonlight ripped apart by waves on the sea's surface, like shimmering stars. In the most fantastical stories or outrageous lies, the stars found in the depths of the cosmos might be teeming with life, much like [[Teyvat]], and the universe itself is akin to an ocean. Realistically speaking, however, if a profound universe full of life exists, why hasn't any of that life made contact with Teyvat?<br>Maybe the universe has been constantly trying to infiltrate Teyvat, or maybe a [[Heavenly Principles|higher power]] created [[False Sky|borders]] to protect this world.|Archive, after {{Quest|Finale}}}}

==Lore==
The All-Devouring Narwhal is a "whale" that does not belong to Teyvat,<ref name="apoc">{{Ref/Quest|Apocalypse}}</ref> and the pet of [[Skirk]]'s master, [[Surtalogi]].<ref name="opera">{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}</ref> When [[Childe]] fell into the [[Abyss]] at the age of 14, he encountered the whale and "awakened" it. This encounter inspired him to incorporate the shape of a whale into his [[Childe#Abilities|combat moveset]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The City of Rains and Remembrance}}</ref> At an unknown point in time, the All-Devouring Narwhal came to Teyvat and started consuming energy from the [[Primordial Sea]], causing the sea levels around [[Fontaine]] to rise. Surtalogi may have intentionally brought it to Teyvat to feed on Primordial Seawater;<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur|quote = '''Skirk:''' [...] It's a strange use of a planet's primordial waters just to raise an All-Devouring Narwhal.}}</ref> however, a more likely possibility is that it followed Childe back to Teyvat after being awakened by him.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Finale|quote = '''Neuvillette:''' But, whether it be by sentiment or reason, that should not have been enough to consider him the root cause of the disaster. At most, he would have had tangential liability.}}</ref>

Attracted to the "blood" of Fontainians, the whale broke into the [[Opera Epiclese]] during [[Furina]]'s trial, but was fended off by Childe in his [[Foul Legacy Transformation]], who had been fighting it for a long time &mdash; ever since he entered the Primordial Sea upon his escape from the [[Fortress of Meropide]].<ref name="apoc"/> It is implied that the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale|Oratrice]] falsely sentenced Childe<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Return to the Waters}}</ref> because [[Focalors]] knew he would escape Meropide and delay the whale.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Finale|quote = '''Neuvillette:''' Whether it was due to that liability by association, or Focalors deliberately using him to buy time for us on the assumption that he would be able to hold the creature off... I cannot say.}}</ref> [[Neuvillette]] and the [[Traveler]] followed the whale back into the Primordial Sea and managed to defeat it, though its prior consumption of energy, plus the power it expended during the battle, caused an upheaval on the surface and triggered the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophesied flooding of Fontaine]]. Skirk arrived shortly after its defeat, compressing it into a small orb before throwing it into another rift. She revealed that she had intended to deal with it herself until it began fighting her disciple.<ref name="opera"/>

According to Skirk, the All-Devouring Narwhal is uncooperative, eats too much, and overall fails as a pet.<ref name="opera"/>
