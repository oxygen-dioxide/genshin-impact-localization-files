|text    = Time passes real quick, huh? Sometimes, when you sail out to sea, you can't ever say when your feet will next touch dry land. By coincidence, our voyage this time was plagued with storm and rain, to the point where two of the lads thought that we might not return.

Hah! As if I'd let them fret &mdash; we all made it back in one piece!

Let's meet up! It's a fine occasion today, so why don't you come over and try some of my cooking?

By the way, here are a few fresh [[Violetgrass]] flowers that I picked along the way.

I heard [[Xiangling]] say that you were on the hunt for these spices for a while.

Next time you need something like that, just give me a shout. I'll get it sorted for you.
