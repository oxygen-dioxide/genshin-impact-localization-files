===Guest Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Xianyun)
:{{A|vo card xianyun freetalk 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' A fine game to be sure, this, but we play with many cards, and once done, we must manually shuffle and sort our decks... Hmm. One has an idea. Perhaps a mechanical desk might be constructed into which cards may be inserted once a game is over, and it shall do both in our stead...

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card xianyun endofgame win 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Come now, do not gaze upon one so. Why would a mere game of cards prescribe mechanical assistance? ...Hmm? Must one then roll up one's sleeves to play? Well. Be it as you wish, then.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card xianyun endofgame fail 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' After such utter defeat, one must now rely on mechanisms to assist the next time we play... Hah, do not pout. It was but a jest. One is no feckless insouciant.
