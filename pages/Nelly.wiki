:'''Nelly:''' Look, I've caught a major story!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Nelly:''' I'm fishing for... *ahem* I mean, I'm looking for something I can write a news report about!
::'''Nelly:''' Ah, you were thinking of jokes about the stereotypes about reporters just now, weren't you?
::{{DIcon}} I did think of a few, yes.
:::'''Nelly:''' And you're right to do so! I figured that if I wanted to be a reporter I needed to act like one. So I started to imitate all the stereotypes people have about reporters.
:::'''Nelly:''' Since I reminded you of one, that means I'm doing a good job. Heh.
::{{DIcon}} I thought you were fishing for "fish."
:::'''Nelly:''' I feel like you're trying to imply something... But you're right! I really want the [[Maintenance Mek: Platinum Collection|Platinum Collection]] and I don't care what anyone else says.
:{{DIcon}} About the production zone...
::'''Nelly:''' It's a production zone, so it's noisy, of course. There are the machines, the [[clockwork meka]]... and the loudspeaker!
::'''Nelly:''' You know, I could probably turn the loudspeaker into a decent news story... yeah, that's a great idea!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Nelly:''' See you. And I hope you catch the fish you want!
