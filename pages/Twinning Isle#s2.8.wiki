;(At the wooden platforms northwest and south of the castle, before completing [[Immernachtreich Apokalypse]])
:'''Night Raven Construction Worker:''' The scene is the most important thing about a show. The stage has to be as beautiful as possible...

;(Investigate the board near the wooden platforms northwest and south of the castle, before completing [[Immernachtreich Apokalypse]])
:'''Announcement Board:''' The Twilight Theater's latest work is currently in development. Please await its arrival patiently!

;(At the bridge to a tower, before completing [[Immernachtreich Apokalypse]])
:'''Working Night Raven:''' Apologies, but the area up ahead is still under construction. Please come here later!

----
;(At the castle elevator)
:'''Guarding Night Raven:''' *yawn* So sleepy...

;(Approach a group of ravens by a table northeast of the castle)
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' Hey, hey, have you heard?
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' About what? Do tell...
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' Wait, stop talking! Someone's coming this way.
;("{{DIcon|Hand}} Listen in Secret" in the nearby conch)
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' Alright, they're gone. What strange happenings have you heard lately?
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' Don't tell a soul, but I've heard that someone saw a shadowy figure slip into the castle cellar!
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' That's right. I heard they're up to mischief in there...
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' Wait, what? Aren't the guards going to check?
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' And there's the rub! When the dark shadow got in, the guards were at the door. They didn't see it at all!
:'''Chatty Night Raven:''' Seriously? That's spooky...

;(Approach the raven on a cliff to the west of castle)
:'''Good-Hearted Raven:''' Wait! Do not do anything foolish!
:'''Good-Hearted Raven:''' Now, I get it. Sometimes, inexplicable troubles will come upon you. Perhaps they might even have you believe that your circumstances are immutable...
:{{DIcon}} Hold on a moment...
:'''Good-Hearted Raven:''' I understand. I understand! I, too, have been in such straits. I understand sometimes that the choices we make are the culmination of all too many negative emotions...
:{{DIcon}} Uh, no, you..
:'''Good-Hearted Raven:''' Perhaps my words cannot comfort you! But I say to you that life must go on for us to experience more beauteous things...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, sure...
:'''Good-Hearted Raven:''' Watching this view together... It is a good thing, is it not? You must put faith in such things, yes... To give up here would be a crying shame.
:'''Good-Hearted Raven:''' Things may seem difficult now, but persist, I say, persist!
:{{DIcon}} Um, thanks. Yeah. Thanks.
:'''Good-Hearted Raven:''' Keep it up! You can do this!

;(East of northern Teleport Waypoint)
:'''Gentle Knight Raven:''' The sky is mighty indeed, to be able to accept all things, yet remain so majestic. I wish that one day, I could be as the sky.
:'''Gentle Knight Raven:''' ...
:'''Gentle Knight Raven:''' Hah, the cusp of midsummer's night is a fleeting dream. If only things could stay this way...
:'''Gentle Knight Raven:''' But summer is brief, Traveler. Joyous times, the morning of youth, the past spent with one's friends, playing and chasing, they all shall pass in the blink of an eye...
:'''Gentle Knight Raven:''' Shall you remember this summer, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps.
:{{DIcon}} I certainly will.
:'''Gentle Knight Raven:''' Haha, I hope you will, and that you will be gladdened whenever you do.

;(By the mainland shore far east of castle)
:'''Night Raven Warrior:''' These monsters are tough. If it wasn't for your help, I don't know what I would've done.
:'''Night Raven Warrior:''' Hmm. Well, allow me to give this to you as gratitude. Please, do not refuse. And now, if you will excuse me, I shall have to check on my wounded comrades now...
;(A [[Common Chest]] spawns)

;(By the well on the islet northmost of the castle)
:'''Thirsty Night Raven:''' Thirsty... Need... water...
:'''Vexed Night Raven:''' How should I bring the water up?
:'''Sharp-Eyed Night Raven:''' Shinies spotted below!

;(North of mainland Waverider Waypoint)
:'''Waterside Night Raven:''' A fine day, this! A splendid hour for Ersatz Angling. Ah what a shame...
:{{DIcon}} What's Ersatz Angling?
:'''Waterside Night Raven:''' Oh, impeccable timing. Now, explaining would be a hassle, so why not experience it yourself? See the chair over there? Just sit on that and pull up your fishing rod. That's all it takes!
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Lift Pole
:'''Waterside Night Raven:''' I'm about to hook the bait on!

;(South of mainland Waverider Waypoint, across water)
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Dig
:'''Sand Bath Raven:''' Hey, hey! What are you doing? Can't you see I'm having a sand bath?
:'''Sand Bath Raven:''' *sigh* Yeah, "thanks" for digging me out of there. Now, how am I supposed to get myself back in?

;(Along west entrance to central castle)
:'''Peristerophile Night Raven:''' The white wings of the pigeon suspended in flight are lovely to behold indeed!
;(If the player kills the pigeons)
:'''Peristerophile Night Raven:''' W&mdash;Wait. What are you doing? How could you do that to the pigeons!?
:'''Peristerophile Night Raven:''' Ah, the pigeons, those poor, lovely pigeons...

;(In a cave beneath the central castle)
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Turn Mining Lamp Off
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Turn Mining Lamp Off
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Turn Mining Lamp Off
:'''Night Raven Miner:''' Alright already! Here, take these stuff, and stop bothering me!
;(A [[Common Chest]] spawns)

;(Knock on the tavern door to the northwest)
:'''Cowardly Night Raven:''' D&mdash;Don't hurt me! A&mdash;And don't come any closer, either!
:'''Cowardly Night Raven:''' Y&mdash;You're not a monster or a knave, you say? Wh&mdash;Who'd believe that? I'm n&mdash;never opening this door!
:'''Cowardly Night Raven:''' Didn't I say so already? I&mdash;I won't open this door! Begone!

;(Listen at the tavern on the northeast islet)
:'''Off-Work Raven:''' I'm home!
:'''Housewife Raven:''' You're back so late today. I'm so hungry...
:'''Off-Work Raven:''' I saw a stage on the island on my commute home, and I stood there awhile.
:'''Housewife Raven:''' I've prepared the ingredients...
:'''Off-Work Raven:''' Ok, got it. You go take a rest, I'll finish preparing the meal...
{{Dialogue end}}

====Raven Squire====
{{Dialogue start}}
;(At the west castle wall)
:'''Raven Squire:''' Ah, how shall I decide...
:{{DIcon}} What are you worried about?
:'''Raven Squire:''' I was thinking about how to become an excellent knight like Sir Oz.
:'''Raven Squire:''' Yet my strength is insufficient, so I seek to make up for this deficiency with skill... Just as an example, I was thinking about how to break all these wooden dummies in one fell swoop.
:'''Raven Squire:''' They all say that you have the eyes of our Prinzessin. Surely you have powers beyond the norm! In which case, could you... demonstrate them for me?
:'''Raven Squire:''' I believe you have the capacity to shatter all these wooden dummies in one go...

;(After destroying the three wooden dummies, the Common Chest unlocks)
:'''Raven Squire:''' Huh, so that is how it is done. I am most impressed!
:'''Raven Squire:''' You have taught me much. Please, accept this as a token of my gratitude!
{{Dialogue end}}

====Storyteller Raven====
{{Dialogue start}}
;(At the right of castle entrance)
:'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' Now then, children, what tale would you like to hear today?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to hear the story of the childhood friends.
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' Alright then. Once upon time, there was [[Rameo and Juliette|a pair of childhood friends]]. They grew up together and loved each other dearly, but both of them were too shy to say so. Their love only bore fruit once well-meaning people gave them a push...
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' But the good times did not last, and while they were out playing, they were attacked by monsters. The young lad sacrificed himself to let the other escape...
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' Ah, yet do not fret, for the young lad's cries for help were heard by a passing hero who rescued him. Thus were the two childhood friends reunited.
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' And they lived happily ever after.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to hear the story of the person who wished to become a guard.
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' Haha, sure. Once upon a time, there was [[Elevator to the Cellar|a young man who looked up to his brother]], and wanted to be a castle guard and serve Her Highness the Prinzessin...
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' But this was no easy task. He could only sneak into the palace each day to study what it takes to become a guard. And he studied hard indeed, tiring himself out so much that he would fall asleep in the elevator...
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' The day he was about to become a guard, someone discovered that he had used the palace facilities. This vexed him greatly, as he feared that he would not be able to become a guard were he to be discovered...
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' Yet the person held true and did not tell on him, and so did this young fellow become an excellent guard.
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' And so, too, would this story be passed down in tales.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to hear the story of the brave person who pushed the limits...
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' Hehe, alright. Once upon a time, there was [[The Flight Master|a person most bold]]. He longed to soar through the skies, to feel the rush of wind against his body. He hankered after the unfettered freedom to be found above the clouds.
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' So he feared neither nimbus nor gale, and he pierced through storms and great waves. Many times he was struck down and many times did he fail, but just as many times did he set out once more... Until one day, he became a mater of flight.
::'''Old Storyteller Raven:''' None could match his deeds, and so he retired in glory... They say that he lives as a recluse on this island and that any who wish to receive his tutelage must go to a lone tower in the skies.

===Fischl===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Fischl:''' Hehe, greetings, my most loyal attendant.
:{{DIcon}} Do you want to chat?
::'''Fischl:''' Why, certainly. I bestow upon thee permission to ask any questions.
::{{DIcon}} About Nachtraben Theater...
:::'''Fischl:''' Oh? You have witnessed the theater of the Holy Land?
:::'''Fischl:''' Alright, out with it, be liberal with your words of praise. It is a singular achievement in all the world.
:::'''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein eagerly anticipates your comments.
::{{DIcon}} About "Hymn of the Holy Land"...
:::'''Fischl:''' It is the sacred scripture of the Immernachtreich. It must never be allowed to fall into disrepair from a lack of upkeep...
:::{{DIcon}} I'll take good care of it.
:::'''Fischl:''' Hmph, you'd better.
:::'''Oz:''' In mein Fräulein's mind, it is a treasured memento of this journey. She is positively thrilled to know that you also see it as such.
:::'''Fischl:''' Oz, do not over-interpret my speech!
::{{DIcon}} About this vacation...
:::'''Fischl:''' One was most delighted to behold the grand ceremony and celebration with which one's official excursion to this blessed land was received.
:::'''Fischl:''' Alas, my journey through countless worlds has taught me that even the most splendid of things must come to an end.
:::'''Fischl:''' This is why I have declared to my people that my excursion goes on, as there are still attendants from faraway lands who require the Prinzessin's royal assistance.
:::'''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein cried when she bade farewell to everyone.
:::'''Fischl:''' Oz! I told you, that was only because an insolent grain of sand rudely took refuge in my eyes!
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you.
::'''Fischl:''' O, thou whose fate doth intersect with mine own, please enjoy thyself fully in this paradise.

==Trivia==
* The three stories told by Old Storyteller Raven play out similarly in the three Hidden Exploration Objectives.
* Several of the Ravens are parallels for NPCs in Mondstadt:
** The Chatty Night Ravens are parallels to [[Hillie]] and [[Moco]]. There is a third raven which may represent [[Adelinde]], although Adelinde does not partake in Hillie and Moco's gossip and is in fact the subject of some of their rumors.
** The Peristerophile Night Raven is a parallel for [[Timmie]].
** The Raven Squire is a parallel for [[Ellin]] and her Commission [[Ellin, the Wannabe Knight]].
* The Off-Work Raven makes a cameo in [[Drama Phantasmagoria: Tale of the Sword-Wielding Princess!]].
