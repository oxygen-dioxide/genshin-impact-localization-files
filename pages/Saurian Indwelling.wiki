'''Saurian Indwelling''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. It allows the player to indwell their spirit into [[Natlan Saurian]]s or Spiritsconces and use different skills to assist them in traveling Natlan.

==Overview==
The player can indwell an adult Saurian [[enemy]] regardless of whether it is tolerant or aggressive towards the player. However, Saurians indwelled this way will not reward any [[Character EXP]], [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material]]s, or [[Mora]] and will respawn at their original location after 1 minute, even if the player is still indwelling the original spawn. There is no time limit to indwelling a Saurian.

Some quest-related Saurians, like [["Half-Baked"]]<ref name="Special Friends">{{Quest|Special Friends}}</ref> can reject the indwelling. Attempting to indwell in such cases will display the system message "''You feel a strong will reject your attempt at indwelling...''"

While indwelling a Saurian, the player cannot interact with the following:
* [[Cooking]]
* [[Statue of The Seven]]
* [[Tablet of Tona]]

In addition, while indwelling a Saurian, players who go near enemy Saurians will not cause them to [[Aggravation|aggravate]], though they will be curious of their presence unless attacked, after which combat is initiated. Other enemies will follow normal aggravation rules. If the enemy Saurian is among a group of other non-Saurian enemies, they will likewise aggravate when the non-Saurian enemies do.

Saurians cannot understand human speech, but can understand other Saurians. This will change dialogue between Saurians and humans, with Saurians being understandable and humans not.

===Spiritsconces===
Spiritscones are small, colorful totems that can be found across Natlan as a helpful way for players to travel across specific areas without needing to find a related Saurian. These can be indwelled in the same manner as adult Saurians.

Spiritsconces can occur naturally, but adult Saurian enemies will also leave Spiritsconces behind after being killed. All Spiritsconces will respawn at their original location after 15 seconds, even if the player is still indwelling a Saurian using the original spawn.

A Spiritsconce is also left behind after the player ends an indwelling without killing the Saurian. Up to four Spiritsconces left behind from terminated indwellings, or three if the player is currently indwelling a Saurian, may exist in the world at any given moment. When the limit is exceeded, the oldest Spiritsconce left behind from a terminated indwelling will be removed. The Saurian type does not matter. Indwelling a Saurian has a 4-second cooldown before indwelling another Saurian.

===Taking Damage and Healing===
The amount of [[Fall DMG]] taken while in Saurian form is significantly reduced and static regardless of how far they fall. Yumkasauri also take 50% reduced Fall DMG compared to other Saurians.

Indwelled Saurians can be healed by:
* Standing near [[Everflame Seed (Natlan)|Everflame Seed]]s.
* Standing near a [[Teleport Waypoint]] or [[Statue of The Seven]].

===Using Phlogiston===
The player can enhance the indwelled Saurian's movement by consuming [[Phlogiston]]. Individual Saurians have their own Phlogiston meter, which they will deplete before consuming the player's own.

Phlogiston will be restored when:
* The indwelled Saurian stands near:
** [[Everflame Seed (Natlan)|Everflame Seed]]
** [[Teleport Waypoint]]
** [[Statue of The Seven]]
* The indwelled Saurian touches:
** [[Flaming Seed of Phlogiston]]
** Phlogiston Current ([[Qucusaur]]s only)
* The indwelled Saurian collects:
** [[Candlecap Mushroom]]s
** [[Flamegranate]]s
** [[Crystal Beetle]]s
** [[Pyro Crystalfly|Pyro Crystalflies]]
* The indwelled Saurian destroys:
** [[Phlogiston Pile]]s
** [[Phlogiston Explosive Barrel]]s

===Movement===
A Saurian's movement can be impeded by terrain. Only [[Koholasaur]]s can swim in [[water]] and [[Liquid Phlogiston]], while [[Tatankasaur]]s can also move across water if they are in a charging state. Otherwise, Saurians that enter a body of water that is deep enough will automatically [[Fallen Character#Out of Bounds and Drowning|drown]].

[[Yumkasaur]]s, who can glide across terrain with their grapple, can also scale cliff walls, but not as efficient compared to [[Tepetlisaur]]s. Similarly, [[Qucusaur]]s and [[Iktomisaur]]s are capable of flight, but Qucusaurs can change adjust their altitude, while Iktomisaurs can only glide downwards. Tatankasaurs can charge and collide into [[Pulverite]]. Saurians are not good at running under normal circumstances and are unable to [[Spriting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frame|i-frame]] incoming attacks, making them unfeasible for combat.

===Exiting Indwelling State===
The player can manually eject themselves from the indwelled Saurian by holding {{Key|Q}} in a manner similar to the [[Waverider]].

The player will be automatically ejected and leave a Spiritsconce behind if:
* The player teleports to any Teleport Waypoint.
* The player enters any [[Instance#Natlan|Instance rooms]] (e.g., [[Speaker's Chamber]]).

[[File:Restriction Saurian.png|thumb|250px|right|Attempting to enter [["People of the Springs"]] using [[Yumkasaurus]]]]
The player will be automatically ejected without leaving a Spiritsconce behind if:
* The indwelled Saurian is killed or drowned.
* The player leaves Natlan's boundaries or goes into [[Out of Bounds]] within Natlan.
* The indwelled Saurian attempts to enter the main settlement of a tribe that is not its own (e.g., taking a [[Yumkasaurus]] to [["People of the Springs"]] where only [[Koholasaurus|Koholasauri]] are allowed in). <!-- In lore, the Saurians are allowed in different tribe that is not its own -->

==Gameplay Notes==
* While indwelling a Saurian, players will receive different dialogue upon talking to [[NPC]]s: Saurians become understandable, while all other NPCs<!--including most animal NPCs like alpacas although in-lore wise, they also seems to be understandable--> will only say "..." unless they currently have dialogue specific to a [[Quest]], [[Hidden Exploration Objective]], or [[Commission|Daily Commission]].{{Verify|preliminary conclusion}}
** Some NPCs may have quest-locked dialogue that breaks this convention. For example, after completing ''[[Treasures and Collectors]]'', [[Quipia]] offers the same dialogue regardless of whether the player is indwelling a Saurian or not.
* Indwelling a Saurian will only cause the player to leave combat if the Saurian they indwelled was the only enemy.

==Trivia==
* Indwelling is an ability the Traveler canonically possesses as the "Chosen of Dragons."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in the Woods}}</ref> 
** When [[Chasca]] saw an indwelt Qucusaur, she had a hunch that the Traveler had something to with it, as it had their demeanor, but couldn't pinpoint exactly how and choses not to question them on it. [[Coyllur]], who first unknowingly met the Traveler as the Qucusaur, found that they looked oddly familiar to her when they met in-person shortly after.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Wingless One of Tlalocan}}</ref> Only [[Antu]] recognised the Traveler who indwelled as an adult [[Qucusaurus]].<ref name="Medicine Born of Guilt">{{Ref/Quest|Medicine Born of Guilt|quote=
'''{{Traveler}}:''' Antu.<br>
'''Antu:''' Aaaah! You're... Huh? Aren't you the {{MC|m=blond guy|f=blonde gal}} from just now?<br>
'''Antu:''' Wait... Is this your real form? You can turn yourself into a human? That's amazing! Can you teach me how you do it? I want to talk to the humans, but they don't like me...
}}</ref>
** When finding how to cure Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome, the Traveler indwelt an adult Qucusaur and returned back to [[Atoco]] with Paimon and [[Iansan]].<ref name="Same land">{{Ref/Quest|For the Same Land|quote=;(Talk to Atoco while indwelling a Qucusaurus)<br>
'''Paimon:''' We're back... How are you feeling?<br>
'''Atoco:''' Duarte...?<br>
{{DIcon}} (Step forward)<br>
'''Atoco:''' How... How did you get here? Are you here to save me?<br>
'''Paimon:''' It's working!<br>
'''Iansan:''' Shhh...!<br>
'''Iansan:''' What now?<br>
{{DIcon}} (Tap his head with your claw)<br>
