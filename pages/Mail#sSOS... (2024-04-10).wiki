|text      = Phew, managed to make my escape... That was a close one...

As soon as they heard it was my birthday, the other reporters over at The Steambird insisted on doing an exclusive interview with me, saying they just HAD to write an epic exposé for our readers titled "How Charlotte became Charlotte"... They even said they were going to follow me around for a whole year and write up their findings into a long-read special, and then publish it on my birthday next year!

...Uhhh, no thanks!

To buy myself some time, I told them I needed to go to the bathroom to get changed, then used the opportunity to escape through the window. It was on the third floor, so I had to climb down the drainage pipe to make my getaway... At this very moment, as I write you this letter, I'm over at Euphrasie's trying to keep a low profile. No one would dare barge into the Editor-in-Chief's house!

The only problem is... now I'm stuck here...

If you're free, hurry over and help me out of this mess!

Please, please, triple please! Dinner's on me &mdash; whatever, and however much you want!
