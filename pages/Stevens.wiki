==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
He is a researcher specializing in ancient history. After reading a "truly enlightening" document that [[Iris (Dragonspine Adventurer Camp)|Iris]] sent him, he decided to come to the Dragonspine Adventurer Camp believing that the [[Dragonspine|mountain]] has more to offer than what we see. He even tried to scale the mountain, to no avail.

:'''Stevens:''' *sigh* If only someone could help me out... Oh, sorry, didn't mean to be talking to myself like that.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Stevens/The Keenness of Dragon Claws|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Stevens:''' Thanks for such an enjoyable time. I'm all pumped up now! I'm sure it'll be all smooth sailing for my research from here on out!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Stevens:''' I've lost the game and made no progress in my research. Ugh... What should I do!?
:{{DIcon}} What's the matter?
::'''Stevens:''' Well, here's how it is: I'm a researcher specializing in ancient history...
::'''Stevens:''' Thanks to Ms. Iris, I received and read a truly enlightening document recently.
::'''Stevens:''' She found it here on Dragonspine, and I believe that the mountain must be home to more lost texts...
::'''Stevens:''' If we had more of them, I would definitely make progress in my research.
::'''Stevens:''' Never mind weapons or ancient currency, these texts are the true treasure here!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Have you gained anything from your trip so far?
:::'''Stevens:''' Ugh, don't get me started. Iris is far too busy, so I've had to scale the mountain myself...  Almost lost my life in the process, never mind finding any ancient texts.
:::'''Stevens:''' But wouldn't say that I gained nothing from all this. I did find some other things, such as this crown.
:::'''Stevens:''' My guess is that this was left behind by those who once wanted to conquer Dragonspine, One can only wonder as to the trials and tribulations they must have encountered.
:::'''Stevens:''' ...I fear we can only discover a few things about the past through these relics...
:::'''Stevens:''' Ugh sorry, I'm rambling... I've already gleaned all I could from this item. From the looks of you, you must be an adventurer, so why don't you take this with you?
:::'''Stevens:''' Don't stand on ceremony &mdash; it's no use to me anyway, and what's more, I may require your assistance in the future, too.
::;(Obtain 4{{star}} {{Item|Broken Rime's Echo}})
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'll leave you to it.
::'''Stevens:''' Goodbye. Be careful, this is an uncannily perilous place.
