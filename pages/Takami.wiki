{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Takami:''' Hi, do you have any questions regarding festivals or the [[Fireworks Show]]?
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
::'''Takami:''' I work for the Yashiro Commission and am in charge of the festivals and Fireworks Show. You can entrust me with any work that is related to event organizing, venue management, or festival- and Fireworks Show-related.
::'''Takami:''' A traveler like yourself really must come and experience Inazuma's seasonal festivals and renowned Naganohara Fireworks Show.
::'''Takami:''' Though short-lived, their radiant flares and meteoric glitters are a sight to remember for sure.
::{{DIcon}} Can I ask about those fireworks?
::'''Takami:''' Speaking of our fireworks. Have you heard of Naganohara Fireworks? They are the oldest and one of the best fireworks shops in all of Inazuma. They're also the organizer of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.
::'''Takami:''' I went to see the Naganohara Fireworks Show with my parents when I was still a child. I will never forget the spectacular sights that night.
::'''Takami:''' It was at that very moment that I realized my calling. I wanted to work somewhere related to the Fireworks Show to help and promote Inazuma's fireworks to all of Teyvat. This way, everyone will be able to witness and enjoy their beauty.
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Takami:''' Thanks to Ms. Yoimiya, my wishes are slowly becoming realized, even with the restrictions of the [[Sakoku Decree]].
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Takami:''' Now that the shipping lanes have been re-opened, and with Ms. Yoimiya's help, my wishes are now being realized.
::{{DIcon}} So, about Yoimiya...
::'''Takami:''' Ms. Yoimiya is the current shop keeper at [[Naganohara Fireworks]]. Not only has she inherited the firework craftmanship of Mr. Naganohara, she is also amazing at running the shop.
::'''Takami:''' She also takes in people's wishes and makes brand-new custom fireworks for them. When it comes to pyrotechnics that can light up the entire night sky, Yoimiya's the only one you can call.
::'''Takami:''' She even had [[The Crux Fleet]] from Liyue ship fireworks overseas just to fulfill my ridiculous wish of spreading Naganohara Fireworks across all of Teyvat.
::'''Takami:''' I'm not sure how she made it happen, but I am genuinely grateful and have the utmost respect for her.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Takami:''' Alright, goodbye!
