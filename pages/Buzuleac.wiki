'''Buzuleac''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations}}. He may be killed if the Traveler chooses to reveal that they are related to the [[Shuumatsuban]]. His real identity is a [[Fatui Skirmisher - Geochanter Bracer]].

==Profile==
Like several of those under [[Efim Snezhevich]]'s command in [[Inazuma]], Buzuleac appears to be an orphan who was raised in the [[House of the Hearth]] and joined the [[Fatui]] after being deemed as "having potential." While little about Buzuleac is known, he may have had some [[Sumeru]] heritage, based on his choice of disguise and his statement that [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]] was lucky to have Inazuman blood, which made it easier for her to blend in with the locals.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Buzuleac has light brown hair and blue eyes. He wears dark gradient gray-bluish robes with a light tan scarf draped on his neck.
