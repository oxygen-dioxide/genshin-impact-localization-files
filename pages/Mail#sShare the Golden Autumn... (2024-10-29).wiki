|text      = Roaming as a wanderer, I return to my hometown from time to time, countless emotions sitting in my heart. I've tried capturing moments in photographs or written poems, but nothing compares to being with a dear friend, immersed in the crimson peaks, quietly enjoying the rising and setting of the sun, and the ebb and flow of rain and shine.

I'm writing this letter from a pavilion nestled in the mountains, hoping that we might share this golden autumn together, even if for merely a day or a half, or just a few fleeting moments... The beauty before us is such that even a brief pause can bring clarity to the heart. With a serene mindset, be it a wanderer or a traveler, I believe one can journey even further.

The autumn wind has arrived once again, bringing a gentle chill in the mornings and evenings. Enclosed are a few pieces of fine cloth - they are not luxurious, but they are the warmest and most comfortable I could offer. The winds have been strong lately, so take care not to catch a chill.

Please, worry not about me.

As one who drifts like clouds, the flowing melodies brush through my sleeves, and I'll go wherever the wind leads.
