{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jilliana:''' Oh, hey.
:'''Jilliana:''' May [[Barbatos]]' gentle wind be with you.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Jilliana:''' Have you also come here to pray? If we pray to Lord Barbatos with a sincere and earnest heart, He will certainly hear our cry and respond.
:{{DIcon}} Is Lily your daughter?
::'''Jilliana:''' Oops, did I say my prayers out loud by mistake?
::'''Jilliana:''' ...I should concentrate more when I pray.
::'''Jilliana:''' Lily is my daughter. She is a gift from Barbatos; the gift of hope.
::'''Jilliana:''' All it was, was, Lily was pestering me this morning to get her a present.
::{{DIcon}} You really love your daughter.
::'''Jilliana:''' It's true, I do.
::'''Jilliana:''' ...I have been through many... bad things in my life.
::'''Jilliana:''' Luckily, I have moved past all that now. I have a family, and most importantly of all... I have Lily.
::'''Jilliana:''' As long as you keep going, keep trying, eventually the day will come when the [[archon]] hears you and rewards you for your willing heart.
::'''Jilliana:''' At this point, some people reveal their heart's desire and get what they have always dreamed of having &mdash; a [[Vision]].
::'''Jilliana:''' ...But to me,  my Lily is as precious of a gem as any Vision you could offer me; probably even more precious.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Jilliana:''' Bye.
::'''Jilliana:''' Come what may, I wish health and happiness for you and your family.
