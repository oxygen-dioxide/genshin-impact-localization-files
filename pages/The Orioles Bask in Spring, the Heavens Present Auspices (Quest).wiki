{{Quest Description|You and Paimon return to Liyue, preparing to take part in the annual Lantern Rite. As expected, there are familiar faces to be seen as you walk around the harbor...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lantern Rite should be coming up soon, right? Everyone must be busy buying things to making their homes more festive now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wonder what this year's theme is going to be. Oh, Paimon can't wait to find out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head to Liyue Harbor and ask around!

;(Approach Keqing and Charlotte)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Keqing! And Charlotte? Paimon never thought she'd see you two together.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Nice to see you again, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{Introductory Note|Keqing}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we're not interrupting anything, are we?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Not at all. I wasn't in the middle of an interview or anything. I was just asking Miss Keqing about purchasing a kite.
:{{Introductory Note|Charlotte}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A kite? Are you buying some regional specialties to bring back to Fontaine?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well, yes. And...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It seems you haven't heard yet. The theme of this year's Lantern Rite is "Kites."
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So that's why Paimon has seen so many floating in the sky!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Liyue Harbor is always changing, so it is only fitting that Lantern Rite should change in turn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The Qixing believes it would benefit Liyue to build on our own cultural foundation by embracing the technologies of other nations. After all, it is said that "the stones of another mountain may serve to better polish one's own jade."
;(If the player did not complete ''[[Roll! A Sea of New Acquaintances]]'')
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' So, Ningguang organized a private meeting with Miss Charlotte to ask for her help in fostering cooperation with the right people.
;(If the player completed ''[[Roll! A Sea of New Acquaintances]]'')
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Yeah, remember my "business meeting" with Tianquan Ningguang the last time I was in Liyue Harbor? That's what it was about.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But, all I really did was use my network to introduce Lady Ningguang to some interesting people. I'm not sure that quite counts as "fostering cooperation"...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' In the end, we decided to combine Liyue's traditional art of kite-making with Fontaine's "Mechanical Vertical Lifting Device."
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mechanical... Lifting Device? Sounds pretty impressive!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But don't kites just use the wind to fly? Why would you need to add something mechanical?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Well, you've actually just answered your own question, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' How high and far a kite can fly depends as much on the weather conditions as on the skill of the person holding the string.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But as soon as there's no wind, you can only flail about helplessly like a [[Sweet-Flower Medaka]] out of water. Experience doesn't matter at that point.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Exactly. Liyue is now a nation ruled by humans after all. It's about time we had the power to make a kite fly, don't you think?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Plus, the easier we can make it to enjoy, the more people will want to participate!
:{{DIcon}} That's not a bad idea!
:{{DIcon}} Sounds awesome!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Right!? I also thought it was a novel idea! Plus, it shouldn't cost much to do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' With Miss Charlotte's help, everything has gone smoothly. Our new mechanical kites are already available to purchase from a stall in the harbor. We're having trouble keeping up with demand.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' We also gave quite a bit of thought to the price. We didn't want it to be too much more expensive than a traditional kite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool! Turns out you two and Ninguang {{sic}} like playing with toys just as much as Paimon!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Toys? They're not exactly toys...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You see, Miss Keqing? That does seem to be everyone's first reaction.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm, although kites are one of our most time-honored cultural relics, outside of their use in certain ceremonies, I suppose they're considered "playthings" more than anything now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 15.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' But to me, they're so much more than that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 16.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Think for a second about how remarkable it is that a flimsy paper kite attached to a string has the capacity to touch the sky. It is this slight piece of paper that also carries the weight of Liyue's cultural traditions.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 17.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' There's an old poem that goes, "O kite borne of paper flying true and sound, a lone traveler wanders just waiting to be found, send them love, send them word, send them homeward bound."<ref group="Note">The voiceover for this dialogue prematurely ends on the word "found."</ref>
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 18.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' In the past, poets from Liyue used kites to symbolize a feeling of longing or evoke the peacefulness of idyllic rural scenery.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 19.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If the people of today can derive enjoyment from this activity, they will not only be more likely to better appreciate the tradition, but also to pass it down to the people of tomorrow.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the Keqing we know, always thinking five steps ahead of anyone else...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well said, Miss Keqing! I've learned quite a bit myself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 20.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Haha, as long as you're willing to listen, I'm happy to share.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 21.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I also know quite a lot about the various folk traditions related to kites.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 22.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' For example, whenever a kite blew away, people would say it was the Adepti that summoned the wind to take it away as an offering. That way, you can turn an unfortunate event into an auspicious one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about something more fun? Do you know anything like that?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 23.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' More fun... Hmm, let me think. Oh, I suppose we should first talk about how kites are made. It's another one of our precious forms of traditional craftsmanship.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 24.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' My grandfather told me that, back when he was a boy, children learned the art of kite-making step by step from their elders.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 25.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' First, you use thin strips of bamboo to construct the frame, then you draw a design of your choice on a piece of paper, paste it onto the frame, and tie on the string...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 26.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Then you look towards the sky and release the kite to soar among the clouds.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 27.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Some people write down certain names or desires on their kites, cut the string, and let them fly free. Others may place particular thoughts or meaning into the design itself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Are certain designs associated with certain meanings? I'm going to jot all of this down.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 28.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm... Well, for example, kites in the shape of a butterfly typically symbolize freedom, happiness, or the desire to break free.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Fascinating! What else can you tell me?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 29.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The scissor-tailed swallow is the most classic design. It symbolizes good fortune and joyful tidings. Different colors also have small variations in meaning.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Are these commonly understood meanings and symbols in Liyue? Kind of like the language of flowers in Fontaine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 30.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I believe so. Most have probably heard something about it from their elders at some point.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 31.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If you're interested, Miss Charlotte, I have several books on the topic that I could lend you. They could be a useful reference.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' That would be a huge help!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 13.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Great, looks like I've got the outline for quite the article on my hands!
:{{DIcon}} Hope it goes well.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Perfect! We're gonna take a look around.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 32.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Then I'll show Miss Charlotte to my home for a little while.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 33.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ah, I almost forgot. The Ministry of Civil Affairs is hosting a kite-flying contest on the night of Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 34.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' {{Traveler}}, if you're interested, you're more than welcome to bring a kite and participate.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 35.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The rules are simple. Whoever flies their kite the highest and furthest within the time limit will receive a special honor along with a secret prize.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 charlotte 14.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I've already prepared more than enough empty film for the event. I can see the spectacle already!
:{{DIcon}} We'll be there!
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 11a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon was on board the moment you said "secret prize!"
:{{DIcon}} We've got it in the bag.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 11b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, maybe tone it down a bit, {{Traveler}}. What if we don't win?
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 11b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's better to keep a low profile until the competition starts. Then, we'll give them a show they never saw coming! That secret prize is ours!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 keqing 36.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Then I'll look forward to seeing your performance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You bet, see you then!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, {{Traveler}}! Take a peek to your right... Do you see those two people lurking over there?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I see them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or were they staring at us the whole time we were talking to Keqing and Charlotte just now? They seem fishy.
:{{DIcon}} The Qixing do attract a lot of attention.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 15a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Well, yes. But...
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 15a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Something's up. Paimon just has a bad feeling.
:{{DIcon}} I agree.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 15b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great, so it wasn't just Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you think they could be Treasure Hoarders? They always seem to be stirring up trouble during Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's sick of waiting around for something bad to happen. We should strike first! You know, foil their plans before they even begin!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You go right. Paimon will go left!
:{{DIcon}} Wait, Paimon!

;(Approach [[Houzhang]] and [[Jiehu]])
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 01.ogg}} '''???:''' It is with such an air of urgency that you appear before us. Your comportment suggests you believe us to have committed some heinous crime. Perhaps you could enlighten us as to your intentions.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, where did this fuddy-duddy come from?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You should be the one doing the enlightening, buddy!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't think we didn't notice you eavesdropping! One look and we could tell you were up to no good. Tell us everything, starting with your name!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 02.ogg}} '''???:''' One bears no secrets before two such as yourselves. You stand in the presence of the mighty and illuminated adeptus, [[Moon Carver]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 03.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' For the purpose of this foray into the mortal realm, however, you may address one as Houzhang.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pfft, you kidding!? That deer's got his head stuck so far up in the clouds, there’s no way he'd humble himself down here with the rest of us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 03.ogg}} '''???:''' *ahem* You may want to hold your tongue, Paimon...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ha, don't think that Paimon is going to believe you just because you know her name. Let Paimon guess, you're supposed to be [[Mountain Shaper]], right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 04.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Indeed! Moon Carver and myself have descended upon the mortal realm for a visit. The two of you may call me Jiehu.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like you did your research. But in our experience, the harder you try to lead us on, the more likely it is that we've got a big fish on our hands!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, we'll go straight to the Millelith and have you arrested for impersonating Adepti!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 04.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Preposterous! Utterly preposterous!
:{{DIcon}} If you really are who you claim to be...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps you can prove it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! Tell us something that only an Adeptus would know, and it better not be some common knowledge that any person on the street could tell you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 05.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' *sighs*
;(If the player did not complete ''[[A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul]]'')
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 11.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' You may recall that, in order to preserve the tranquility of one's mountain, one planted karst crawlers around Mt. Hulao.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 12.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' In fact, the seeds are one of [[Streetward Rambler]]'s cultivars. Among all the Adepti, her horticultural skill is preeminent.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 13.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' The plant neither wilts nor withers and its practical use is undeniable. Yet, it does require quite the upkeep. After a while, one tires of the effort.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 14.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Thus, one had no choice but to foray into town to inquire from Streetward Rambler a gentler and more easily managed variety.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 07.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' On your way, you were accosted by a group of youths and, without revealing your true form, were unable to extricate yourself of their presence. If one's memory serves, Streetward Rambler had to personally come to your rescue.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 15.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Uh...
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 16.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' How did you come into possession of such knowledge?
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 08.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' The young lass, [[Yaoyao]], keeps no secrets from Cloud Retainer.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 17.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' ...*sigh* Alas, one can only let bygones be bygones...
;(If the player completed ''[[A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul]]'')
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 06.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' During the [[The Exquisite Night Chimes|last Lantern Rite]], we gathered at Mt. Hulao with Rex Lapis and made use of Cloud Retainer's [[Supreme Cuisine Machine]] to prepare [[Bamboo Shoot Soup]]. Perhaps you have some recollection?
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 07.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' The flavor of that soup was more than enough to whet one's appetite. As such, Cloud Retainer assented to my use of the device beyond that singular occasion, providing other recipes, to boot. Since then, one has dabbled in the pleasures of the culinary arts whenever time allows.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 05.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Dabbled? Upon one's last sojourn to your mountain, did you not immediately attempt to hide the device behind a chunk of amber as soon as one's presence was known?
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 08.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Uh...
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 09.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Did one not speak up on your behalf but a moment ago? This is how you choose to repay that kindness?
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 06.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' One is simply trying to emphasize the veracity of our claim.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 10.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' That does not mean you should reveal personal matters so readily. They might think one bears no difference from Cloud Retainer. *sigh* Forget it, one does not have the breath to waste on such petty trifles.
:{{DIcon}} I suppose they really are the adepti...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, that might've been more detail than we needed... Seems like you two are the real deal and Paimon's sorry for suspecting you...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But uh, for beings as forgiving as yourselves, this is just water under the bridge... right?
:{{DIcon}} Take it as a compliment to the quality of your disguise...
:{{DIcon}} Few people will be able to see through it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 09.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' You indeed have an agile mind, {{Traveler}}. Cloud Retainer was not mistaken in her high estimation of you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's still curious about something. It's just...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can understand why Mountain Shaper is here, but why did you decide to come to the city, Moon Carver? It's not really your thing, is it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 10.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Hmph...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 18.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' *sighs*
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 together 01.ogg}} '''Houzhang & Jiehu:''' It is but an inevitable eventuality...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 19.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Long have the mountains remained strangely idle since Cloud Retainer's move to Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 20.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' With Lantern Rite near at hand, one would expect Cloud Retainer to provide us with an account of the festivities in advance. Yet, to this day, she has failed to appear.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 11.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Cloud Retainer is hardly the forgetful sort.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 21.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' One must never rest idle in the face of that which demands action. And since our acquaintances dwell in Liyue Harbor, we had to travel here in human form to avail ourselves of their aid &mdash; Cloud Retainer's, in this case.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 12.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' But a moment ago, one heard you speak of a... mechanical kite of sorts. It appears the essence of the situation has hitherto revealed itself. Now it is time for one to retire back to one's abode.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So you're not looking for Cloud Retainer anymore?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 22.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Perhaps there are aspects of Cloud Retainer's temperament that remain opaque to young Paimon. Given one's understanding, one can only imagine the anger that now consumes her...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 13.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Cloud Retainer is of a proud and arrogant disposition. She holds the belief that her skill in mechanics surpasses that of all others. One can be quite certain it is hardly with an open mind that she regards the arrival of this new technology.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 23.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' One surmises that she has shut herself away, refused all company, and buried herself in the study of her own creations... To call on her would only invite her rebuke.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 moutainshaper 24.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' However, if you do happen to cross paths with her over the next few days, do pass along one's regards.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure! Leave it to us!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have a safe trip back, enjoy the scenery, and happy Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 xueyue 14.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Thank you for your kind words. We shall now depart.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We got all worked up for nothing, huh? All that trouble and it turned out to be people we knew all along...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, it's still pretty early. Let's head over and check out the kite stalls.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 3 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to see what kinds of kites we can buy to use in the competition. The bigger and prettier the better!

;(Talk to Zhenyuan)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 zhenyuan 01.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Welcome! Are the two of you looking to buy a kite? Would you like me to go over the different designs?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, a scissor-tailed swallow! And a butterfly! And... Oh!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 zhenyuan 02.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Ah, this Jade Chamber design is our newest. It's been selling like crazy over the past two days.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does it also have a unique meaning?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 zhenyuan 03.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Of course. The Jade Chamber symbolizes wealth and abundance. The kite bearing its design is said to bring riches in the future to those who fly it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Now that's Paimon's kind of kite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 01.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' I apologize for the interruption but are all your wares in order, Miss Zhenyuan?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 zhenyuan 04.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Yes, yes, they're just over there. The paper, bamboo, and dyes... All the necessary kite-making materials.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 02.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' Wonderful. I'll pack them up and get a guard to deliver the goods to Yilong Wharf for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yilong Wharf? Oh, wonder what that place is like during Lantern Rite. Paimon would love to go take a look!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 03.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' If the two of you are interested in going to Yilong Wharf, then could I trouble you to find [[Gaming]] and deliver these goods together?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is Gaming the guard you just mentioned?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 04.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' Yes. The [[Communications Office]] handles shipments and transports around Liyue. He works for the [[Secure Transport Agency]], one of our sub-organizations.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 05.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' The problem is, many of my colleagues have taken leave during Lantern Rite to spend time with their families. So, our available workforce has seen a dramatic decrease recently.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 06.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' If you were willing to help out, then I could get a head start on my next appointment...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You do seem really pressed for time...
:{{DIcon}} We'll help.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 07a 1.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' Wonderful! You will of course be compensated for your efforts!
:{{DIcon}} We expect to be compensated...
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 07b 1.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' Of course, of course! Hard work deserves ample rewards.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 longzhou 08.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' Now, at this time of day... Gaming should be somewhere in the vicinity. Just follow the main road until you see the head of a Wushou dance costume. Should be on your right.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 4 zhenyuan 05.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Be sure to come back if you'd like to buy a kite! I'll even give you a discount!

;(Talk to Zhenyuan again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj301 zhenyuan 01.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' By the way, do you know my aunt? Everyone calls her Granny Shan.
:{{A|vo dialog  eqhdj301 zhenyuan 02.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' I've heard her mention Gaming before. Apparently, he's a nice, outgoing fellow and all-around good guy.

;(Approach Gaming and Xiaqing)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Wait, I thought we had an agreement? Loser buys dim sum tomorrow. Look at you, scowl like that for much longer, and your face might stay that way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Hey now, don't be upset. How about this, you extend the invitation, and I'll pay.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 xiaqing 01.ogg}} '''Xiaqing:''' No way, Gaming! You're always the one picking up the tab.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 xiaqing 02.ogg}} '''Xiaqing:''' I'm not trying to be a sore loser, I just... didn't expect you to come from behind to win like that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Hehe, that was nothing. All in a day's work, friend.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Perfect! Gaming is here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry to interrupt, Gaming. We just spoke to a guy from the Communications Office who needs you to deliver some goods to Yilong Wharf.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh! Must have been Longzhou. Looks like I've got work. Gotta go!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 xiaqing 03.ogg}} '''Xiaqing:''' Sure, go do your thing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 xiaqing 04.ogg}} '''Xiaqing:''' Let's have a rematch when you get back. I won't let you win so easily next time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Alrighty, you can hand the goods over to me. Must have been heavy hauling them all this way. Let me take them off your hands.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, it wasn't that bad. It's just some kite-making materials. Plus, we didn't have to walk very far.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Kite-making materials... I see, I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm glad it wasn't too much trouble, Paimon. Still, I owe you one!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' And you must be {{Traveler}}! It's nice to meet you! Thanks for your help!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You know us?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Haha, there probably aren't many in Liyue who don't. I've heard quite a bit about you two, you're quite well-known around these parts!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 10.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh! And please excuse Longzhou if he forgot to thank you. Take my thanks in his place.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 11.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' He's a good guy. He's just been super busy lately, running around from place to place... Don't be too hard on him, yeah?
:{{DIcon}} No worries.
:{{DIcon}} No thanks necessary.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 12.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' So, you here for Lantern Rite?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! It's always so lively this time of year. We were actually hoping we could tag along to Yilong Wharf and have a look around.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 13.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Perfect! We'll go together then!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 14.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm good with directions, so just follow me. Trust me, I know my way around. We can exchange stories, tell jokes, or just chat along the way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 15.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh, and there are a couple of good places to eat along our route. We can stop and grab a bite when it's time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 16.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' The ingredients are fresh, the portions are generous, and the prices won't break the bank. You can order anything and I promise you won't be disappointed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Order anything...?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon seems to be drooling already.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, did you really have to call Paimon out like that in front of our new friend?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 17.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Don't worry! I understand. I joke around like that with my friends, too. It just shows how close you are.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 18.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' You need to pack anything up before we hit the road? I can wait.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope. Our things are always packed and ready. We're pretty much travel experts at this point.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 6 gaming 19.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh! That's right! Then let's get going. If we run into any trouble, you can count on me to protect you. I am a guard after all.

;(Leave [[Carp's Rest]] if the player was teleported away for ''[[Qiaoying of the Sacred Mountain]]'')
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 7 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' You're back! Geez, guys, where'd you go? One moment you were there, the next you'd disappeared &mdash; scared the life outta me!
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh we're so sorry! We were just, uh... Ugh, it's kinda hard to explain.
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 7 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Eh, fair enough. Well, the mountain road is pretty hazardous, and it's easy to get lost in the fog &mdash; so from here on out, stay close to me!
::{{A|vo eqhdj301 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it. Let's keep going!

;(Approach the bridge by the Statue of The Seven in Chenyu Vale{{colon}} Upper Vale)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 7 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' The docks are just a bit further. One step at a time! Hang in there!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 7 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Wait! ...Get behind me. I'll handle this.

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Seems like we really can't go anywhere without running into Treasure Hoarders, can we?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Yeah, it's not uncommon for deliveries to get intercepted. That's why this job needs guards like us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon was impressed by your moves back there. You seem like a real pro at your job.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh! That's not a skill I learned on the job. It's just a hobby.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Have you ever heard of Wushou dancing?
:{{DIcon}} I've heard about it somewhere.
:{{DIcon}} I don't think so.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Really? Wushou dancing is famous in Chenyu Vale.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Performers might be invited to promote the opening of a business or to spread good fortune during a holiday season.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' But I must admit, it has nothing on the popularity of the Liyue opera.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm also well aware that people in Liyue Harbor aren't exactly jumping at the chance to watch Wushou dancing... So it's not something I do full-time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You have two jobs? How do you have the energy to do all that?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' It's not that tiring. You just have to take a rest.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon gets it. So you must sleep a lot then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Not really. Just yesterday, I stayed up all night playing cards.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 8 gaming 10.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Let's go. The docks are just up ahead.

;(Approach the docks)
:{{Black Screen|Gaming walks forward and exchanges a few words with [[Bosu|a boatman]] near the docks. The next thing you know, he's called for everyone to board a bamboo raft...}}<!--auto-advancing dialogue-->
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Finally, we can rest! Paimon's shoulders are so stiff, and her stomach's so empty...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Sorry, sorry! Did I push the pace a bit too much? I mean, you were the ones who said you were travel experts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Liyue's just too hilly. Floating up and down so much wears Paimon out. *sigh* Paimon was finally satisfied, and now her poor stomach's empty again...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Would you like some Winter Melon Cake? I have some on me that I bought from a store.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes! Paimon'll take all you've got!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' You might want to pace yourself there or you'll be too full to eat a proper meal later.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pfft, Paimon never gets too full! Just like... Oh! Just like you, apparently, never get tired, no matter how far you walk or how many jobs you work.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Ah, I see. Then here you go, Paimon. And for you, {{Traveler}}. Enjoy!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' And here's some for you too, Uncle Bosu. Don't think I forgot about you, my friend. I'll just set it to the side here for ya.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Gaming seems like a real people person. He can get along with anyone, and he treats every person he meets like a close friend.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, that hit the spot! Paimon thought she was going to starve to death for a minute there!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Ha, that close of a call, huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I've been eating Winter Melon Cake ever since I was a kid. You can buy them from all sorts of places, whether it's a small vendor on the side of the road or a big restaurant in the city, but each place produces cakes with a slightly different flavor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' If you like these ones, I can give you the address of the shop I bought them from. I'll just have to check when we get back.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Ah! All my jabbering must be making it difficult for you to enjoy the scenery in peace. Don't be afraid to tell me to zip it for a little while, okay? Really, I won't be offended.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's okay! Paimon is kind of enjoying listening to your chitter-chatter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 gaming 10.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Aw, a fed Paimon is a happy Paimon, huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Paimon can be in a good mood any time she wants!

:{{A|vo eqhdj301 11 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Don't forget your things, and watch your step as you get off the raft or, you're in for a swim.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 11 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Thanks for the ride, Uncle Bosu. You take care of yourself now. I'll see you some other time!<!--stops auto-advancing dialogue-->

:{{A|vo eqhdj301 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pfft, they're your family, not your arch-enemies. What's there to be afraid of? Unless... Oh, did you do something horrible to them?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 13 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' No, it's not that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 13 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm just... not that good at dealing with my family.

:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Uncle Yongzan says that he doesn't have the personnel to spare for this delivery right now. So, what do you think, Uncle Zhigui? Should I go ahead and deliver it instead?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 09.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Ah, it feels like we've troubled you enough already.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' It's kite-making materials, though. Could be for a kid.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm sure the sender wants it delivered before Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 gaming 10.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh! By the way, here, have some tea.
:{{Black Screen|The refreshing aroma and lingering aftertaste of the "Sunglo Tea" invigorates your spirits.}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 10.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Alright then. Deliver it if you want to.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 gaming 11.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Ooh, are you free in two days? How about we grab some dim sum from Xinyue Kiosk? My treat &mdash; and don't even think about trying to pay.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah... That's way too generous of you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 gaming 12.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Ah, don't mention it! Just think of this as a thank you for all your help. Besides, the thing between me and my family... It's a long story. It might take some time to tell.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds good! Paimon never says no to free food!
:{{DIcon}} See you at Xinyue Kiosk, then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 gaming 13.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Alright, then I'm off. See you in two days! Oh, and Paimon, make sure not to eat too much before then. Don't say I didn't warn you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is he underestimating Paimon? Hah! She's just gonna have to show him how much she can really eat!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, is Gaming's family situation really that complicated?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He has such a happy-go-lucky personality. Plus, he's an enthusiastic and diligent worker. It's hard to imagine a guy like that being troubled by much...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 11.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Hm... How should I put it...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 12.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Since he already plans to tell you himself, you don't need an old man like me to add my two cents.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 13.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' You seem to be around the same age, so you might have a lot in common.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 14.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Perhaps you could help him talk things through... Consider it a favor to me.
:{{DIcon}} I'll try.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you have the time, maybe you can make a little flag for us to wave about.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It can say: "We provide aid in spades!" Couldn't hurt to advertise our services, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 15.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Well, I can certainly arrange that! Is there anything else you want it to say?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, seriously? Paimon was just joking, but if you're going to get us something, she'd much rather have Winter Melon Cake instead.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 16.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Haha, seems like Gaming really has rubbed off on you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 17.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Would you like some more tea? I think there's some left.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No thanks. We came all this way and still haven't gotten a chance to look around the wharf.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should see the kinds of kites they've got. Maybe they'll have ones you can't find in Liyue Harbor!
:{{DIcon}} That's not a bad idea.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 18 zhigui 18.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Alright then. Please do let me know if you'd like more tea. You're welcome to stay as long as you like.

;(Talk to Zhigui, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj301 zhigui 01.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' Gaming is a good kid. I just wish he could reconcile with his family.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj301 zhigui 02.ogg}} '''Zhigui:''' You're around the same age, so he might listen to you. Please talk things through with him.

;(Approach the Lantern Rite decorations)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' The way you speak, one might have presumed you were displeased to be in one's presence.
:{{DIcon}} Greetings, Cloud Retainer.
:{{DIcon}} Greetings, Xianyun.
:{{Introductory Note|Xianyun}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Take note, Paimon. You could learn a thing or two about how to respect your elders.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Starting on the "elder" stuff already, huh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shouldn't you be back in your cave tinkering away at some kite-related thingamabob or something? What brings you out here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And what's with that huge box next to you... Ah, Paimon gets it! You're here to do some shopping, aren't you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' And what of it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' The Qixing's decision to integrate Fontainian technology into said kite-flying competition is of no consequence to oneself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Did you expect one to wilfully compete against the whimsical trends of worldly sentiment, or perhaps even fall to petty sulking over such?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... It's not that we think those things exactly... That's just what Mountain Shaper and Moon Carver told us! Or, Jie something and Hou...? Paimon can't be bothered to remember what their aliases were called.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, they went to Liyue Harbor to look for you. They even asked us to pass along their regards if we ran into you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xianyun?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 07.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Did she... forget about them?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 08.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (It appears time has quite flown since one's arrival in Liyue Harbor. How could one have forgotten about those two old fossils?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 09.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (One shall have to bring them back some divine herbs to atone for this slight... Nay, given that one has ventured all this way to Yilong Wharf, tea would be more advisable.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 10.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' A great thought has illuminated one's mind once again. One is reminded that certain purchases have yet to be made.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 11.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Perhaps you two could wait here whilst one performs this task. It'll be but a moment.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait here? You're really just gonna ditch us here to watch your stuff?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That woman really just does whatever she wants.
:{{DIcon}} Let me go see what she's up to.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave the stuff-watching to you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, not you too, {{Traveler}}! All this Paimon-ditching is super not appreciated!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, just... come back soon, okay? Paimon... Paimon doesn't want anyone to try and steal this stuff!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 fenglian 01.ogg}} '''Fenglian:''' Welcome! Please have a look around. We only sell teas of the finest quality, sourced directly from Qiaoying Village. Might I recommend the Sunglo variety? It's one of our specialties!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 12.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (Now, that sounds promising. One will bring some back for those old fossils, and all will be well...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 13.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Two boxes will do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 fenglian 02.ogg}} '''Fenglian:''' Wonderful! By the way, we're actually running a special Lantern Rite promotion. Buy three boxes, get ten percent off. Four boxes will net you twenty percent off...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 14.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (Twenty percent off four boxes? This merchant strikes a fair bargain. One might as well give some to [[Zhongli|Morax]] and [[Madame Ping|Ping]] too.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 15.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Then four shall suffice.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 fenglian 03.ogg}} '''Fenglian:''' I see. Are you intending to give these as gifts? If so, perhaps I could interest you in these exquisite gift sets. Buy ten, get half off.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 fenglian 04.ogg}} '''Fenglian:''' Look at the magnificent design! And the red ribbon gives quite the festive flair, don't you think? Such a gift would be sure to impress any lucky friend or family member.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 16.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (Ten boxes... seems rather excessive. But if one factors in the [[Xiao|Conqueror of Demons]] and one's disciples...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 17.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 fenglian 05.ogg}} '''Fenglian:''' Ten! Nice round number, don't you think? 'Course you do. I'll even shave a little extra off the price for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 18.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' That is agreeable. One will... *ahem* I will have these boxed up, then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 fenglian 06.ogg}} '''Fenglian:''' Of course, of course. Right away!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 charbonnier 01.ogg}} '''Charbonnier:''' I see you have quite the eye for fine items, Mademoiselle. Perhaps some of my wares might also be of interest to you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 charbonnier 02.ogg}} '''Charbonnier:''' I'm a toy merchant from Fontaine. You'll get nothing but the finest and most intricate clockwork toys Mora can buy here, each one sure to be a source of endless amusement...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 19.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Hmph.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 20.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Perhaps you could enlighten me then. Whence should said amusement be derived?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 charbonnier 03.ogg}} '''Charbonnier:''' Well, uh... That is, of course, best understood by playing with them yourself! If you could wait just a moment, I can bring one out and give you a demonstration.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 21.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 22.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Ahem! There is no need for that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 charbonnier 04.ogg}} '''Charbonnier:''' Uh, Mademoiselle...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 23.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Give me your newest and finest model &mdash; and be sure to package it securely.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 charbonnier 05.ogg}} '''Charbonnier:''' Ah, of course... Here you go.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 charbonnier 06.ogg}} '''Charbonnier:''' The instruction manual is...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 24.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' I can do without. Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 25.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (Many watchful eyes surround this place. If one were to be spotted purchasing a mechanical toy such as this, a child's plaything no less, it would only invite scandal.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 26.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (But there is no harm in bringing it back to study in secret...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I should head back before Xianyun notices...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Xianyun! Did your shopping go smoothly?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 27.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Naturally. One may not delight in social interactions, but that does not mean one lacks said faculties.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It seems like Xianyun is easily swayed into buying things... That box looks fit to burst already.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 28.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' And you two? Are you not here to purchase things?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We just haven't had time yet. It doesn't look like there are any kite stalls around Yilong Wharf, but it does look like there are lots of goods from Fontaine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 29.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' You are also planning to participate in the kite-flying competition, then?
:{{DIcon}} Also...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 30.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' *ahem* One means to say... You, along with all the other youths.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 31.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One has been entreated to share one's kite-making expertise &mdash; and indeed, there was little one could do about such persistent supplication, one moment energetic and earnest, and dejected the next.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 32.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One had no choice but to acquiesce to these requests, and thus, one will be organizing a kite-making workshop to provide personal instruction in this art form.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Who'll be participating, then?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 33.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' [[Shuyu]], [[Shenhe]], [[Ganyu]], and [[Yaoyao]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's quite a few people!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, this is all pretty well, Xianyun, but it's not like you have to make your own kite to participate in the competition. You can just buy one ready-made and call it a day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 34.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Hah, you speak of those equipped with the mechanical lifting device, do you not? 'Tis nothing but a crude piece of mortal machinery.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 35.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' The mechanism that one has developed was the fruit of millennia of meticulous study. Let us not speak of the source of the mechanism's power, but rather its structure.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 36.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' It is composed of materials as light as bamboo and as strong as iron. This composition grants it the lightness of weight to ascend into the sky and the durability to follow the wind for many a mile. It is built with a series of intersecting rods that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 37.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...*sigh* Never mind. It is unlikely the two of you will understand even should one expend the effort to explain. One is better off saving one's breath.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It sure seems like you want to talk about it though...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 38.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...So will you be attending the workshop or not?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait... You've been trying to invite us this entire time?
:{{DIcon}} Seems interesting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 39.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Alright then. No need to prepare the materials, in any case. One has it all sorted.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 40.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Arrive at Mt. Aocang in two days. I shall be expecting you around mid-day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you leaving? Don't you want a guard to help you with that big box of yours?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 41.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Surely you jest. One goes as one pleases. For what reason would one need to rely on another?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh!? It can float? What kind of invention is that?
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 xianyun 42.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One calls it the "Floating Toting Device."
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Uh, she seems pretty proud of that one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look at her walk down the street. She seems so confident, but everyone around her is looking at her all funny. Paimon wonders... Eh, never mind.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But anyway, {{Traveler}}, that box of hers seems to be full of those mechanical lifty thingamabobs!
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not that Paimon was peeking or anything! She just, ah, got a bit unsteady for a second and accidentally brushed the embroidery on top.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And wouldn't you know it, all the stuff inside almost came bursting out! Paimon even went out of her way to keep it all together.
:{{DIcon}} Ah, what will I do about you, Paimon...
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All Paimon's saying is that Xianyun sure does try hard to save face.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What did she call it again? "A crude piece of mortal machinery"? Paimon bets she just can't wait to take it apart and see how it's made.
:{{DIcon}} That does sound like something she would do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Totally! We should probably act like we didn't see anything, though. You know, in consideration of her feelings and all.
:{{A|vo eqhdj301 20 paimon 29.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, that is the "propriety with which one should comport oneself" when it comes to an elder, right?

;(Talk to Fenglian, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj301 fenglian 01.ogg}} '''Fenglian:''' Don't miss out on our Lantern Rite promotion! Only the best teas, sourced directly from Qiaoying Village. May I recommend the Sunglo variety...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj301 fenglian 02.ogg}} '''Fenglian:''' Buy three boxes, get ten percent off, buy four, get twenty percent off... Buy ten, and you get half off.

;(Talk to Charbonnier, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj301 charbonnier 01.ogg}} '''Charbonnier:''' Um, so, that was a sale, somehow... What exactly are Liyue customers looking for, anyway?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj301 charbonnier 02.ogg}} '''Charbonnier:''' Perhaps I should try running some sort of promotion...
