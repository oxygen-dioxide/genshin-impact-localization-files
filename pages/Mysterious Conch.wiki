'''Mysterious Conch''' is a [[Quest Item]] that can be obtained by investigating set locations on the northern tidal flats and shore of [[Tatarasuna]], [[Inazuma]]. In [[Co-Op Mode]], only the host is able to obtain them.

Seven spawn on the first day with four spawning everyday after the first. Three of them may be given to [[Takashi]] once a day for the chance to open one of three common chests behind him offering random rewards. Takashi will accept more conches after each daily [[reset]].

Takashi's chests notably reward the [[Bag of Flower Seeds]] on the second chest opened and the [[Diagram: Hamayumi]] on the seventh chest opened.
