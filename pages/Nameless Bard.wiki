The '''nameless bard''' was a boy who lived in [[Decarabian's Mondstadt|Old Mondstadt]] 2,600 years ago, during the time of [[Decarabian]]'s reign. He befriended the wind spirit who would eventually become [[Barbatos]], the [[Anemo]] Archon of [[The Seven]], and Barbatos' vessel, [[Venti]], was made in his image.<ref name="Venti4">{{Ref/CS|Venti|4}}</ref>

==Story==
Trapped within the Lord of the Tower's storm wall, he yearned to see the world beyond it and bonded with the nameless wisp of wind that would become [[Barbatos]].<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|3}}</ref> The nameless bard led the rebellion against Decarabian with the help of the wind spirit, Decarabian's former lover [[Amos]], a knight (possibly [[Gunnhildr]]), and a [[Red-Haired Warrior|red-haired warrior]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Amos' Bow}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Freedom-Sworn}}</ref>

The rebellion succeeded and slew Decarabian. However, Amos and the bard were mortally wounded in battle and never got the chance to see the world beyond the tower's walls; the bard lived long enough to see Decarabian's fall, propped up in the red-haired warrior's arms with the wind spirit by his side. After the bard died, the wind spirit ascended to become Barbatos, the Anemo Archon of [[The Seven]]. Barbatos' first use of his powers was to create a vessel, [[Venti]], in the nameless bard's image to pay homage to him and live in the world he never had the chance to see.<ref name="Venti4" />

==Trivia==
*The song in [[Freedom-Sworn]], the Song of Resistance, may be the one that the nameless bard played to break the storm barrier around Decarabian's Tower.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Fragment of Decarabian's Epic}}</ref>
*He appears to be left-handed. He plucks the lyre with his left hand but holds the lyre with his right.
