==Start Location==

==Steps==
Upon entering the [[Roots of the Valley of Life|room]] the player will find three locked [[Elemental Monument]]s. The player must use [[Elemental Sight]] to find three "small, shiny buds" on the roots, which will unlock the monuments.
# Use [[Elemental Sight]] to find three "small, shiny buds".
#* The player does not need to climb very high up the roots. All the buds are fairly low.
# Activate the three [[Elemental Monument]]s ({{Anemo}}, {{Geo}}, {{Electro}}).
# Open the Chest.

;(Upon entering the area)
:'''Paimon:''' What huge tree roots! And... are those branches and leaves growing against gravity? Paimon's never seen anything like this...
:'''Paimon:''' The branches have some small, shiny buds growing on 'em, too.<br />If they're too small to see, try using {{Color|buzzword|Elemental Sight}}!

;(If the player climbs too high)
:'''Paimon:''' There's nothing here. Should we go back first?

;(Upon completing the puzzle and opening the chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, it's just a shriveled seed. Hmm, that reminds Paimon of a story from [[Sumeru]]...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, (Traveler), Paimon will tell you the story later while we're on the road!
:;(Obtain [[Shriveled Seed]])
