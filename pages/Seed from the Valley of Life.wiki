{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon entering the area)
:'''Paimon:''' What huge tree roots! And... are those branches and leaves growing against gravity? Paimon's never seen anything like this...
:'''Paimon:''' The branches have some small, shiny buds growing on 'em, too.<br>If they're too small to see, try using {{Color|buzzword|Elemental Sight}}!

;(If the player climbs too high)
:'''Paimon:''' There's nothing here. Should we go back first?

;(Upon completing the puzzle and opening the chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, it's just a shriveled seed. Hmm, that reminds Paimon of a story from [[Sumeru]]...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, {{Traveler}}, Paimon will tell you the story later while we're on the road!

;(If the player has acquired [[Aranyaka (Gadget)|Mysterious Clipboard painting #10]] from [[Static Views|the mailbox]] in [[Vanarana (Subarea)|Vanarana]])
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, why is there a seed in the place depicted in this drawing?

:;(Obtain {{Item|Shriveled Seed}})
