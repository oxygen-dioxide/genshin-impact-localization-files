:'''Less-Than-Legible Notes:''' "Creating murals in places where paint is produced is indeed a good idea. When we repair them, we can {{color|buzzword|just grab the relevant material on the spot and fill the missing paints in}}..."
:'''Less-Than-Legible Notes:''' "...The story couldn't possibly end just as the three tribal warriors were defeated by [[Rumi]] the wicked sorcerer. Could the mural in which [[Kuntur]] appears be somewhere else?..."
:'''Less-Than-Legible Notes:''' "...I can't find the path. Has it been buried? Or is there some sort of mechanism at play here..."

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{w|Malinalco}} is a municipality in the {{w|Ixtapan Region}} of {{w|Mexico}}, the name meaning "where they worship the goddess {{w|Malinalxochitl}}."
**This place was one of the most important Aztec sites, and one of its most important buildings is a Cuauhcalli (House of the Eagles) which was used as a sanctuary for the ''Cuauhpilli'' (Eagle warrior) and ''Ocelopilli'' (Jaguar warrior) for rites such as initiation. 
** The name comes from the {{w|Nahuatl}} words: ''malinalli'' which is a grass known as "Zacate del carbonero;" ''xochitl'' meaning "flower;" and ''co'' meaning "place."
