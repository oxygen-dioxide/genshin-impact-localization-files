'''Broken Isle''' in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]] during [[Version 1.6]] and the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event.

==Part 1==
There is another big island northeast of the one with the Teleport Waypoint. Climb to the top and there will be four [[Ruins Torch]]es that when lit will unlock a chest. Nearby there is an [[Echoing Conch]].

A bit south is a small island with an [[Anemo Pinwheel]] that creates a [[Wind Current]].

==Part 2==
===North Island===
A new island cluster will appear north of Broken Isle. There will be a new Teleport Waypoint and Waverider Waypoint. There will be two Echoing Conches located at the top of two of the mountain peaks. Here the player can start the [[Who Wields the Wild Wind?]] quest.

On the right side of the island there will be a wooden staircase leading up the mountain. There will be Hydro [[Elemental Amber]]s along the way and vines that can be [[Climbing|climbed]] like ladders. Once the top is reached, there will be 3 peaks with Hilichurl mobs. Defeat these 3 mobs to unlock the chest at the bottom that is sealed by a red force field. Note that around the top of the northern-most peak of the island there will be 1 Echoing Conch (A Father's Thoughts) and at the top of the southwest peak of the island there will be 1 Echoing Conch in a cage.

Once the red force field is broken, defeat the [[Stonehide Lawachurl]] to access the chest at the bottom.

After completing Act 3 of [[Midsummer Island Adventure]], [[Diluc]] could be found here near the teleport point until the end of the event.

===Main Island===
On the main island just above the words Broken Isle on the map: there will be 1 [[Echoing Conch]] (Tidewatch Sentries) located on the ground above a Hydro Abyss Mage.

In the northwest part of the island there will be a conch at the top of the peak. There will also be a [[Bloatty Floatty]] and [[Time Trial Challenge]].

To the west of the Teleport Waypoint, there are some Hymnal Rings, including a moving Pyro Hymnal Ring. Throw the [[Wind-Blessed Harpastum]] at the right time to get it through the red ring and unlock the chest.

At the southwest part of the island there is a group of rings. One of them can be rotated upon interaction. Rotate it 270 degrees (3 times), and then throw the harpastum to break both targets.

A large puzzle with multiple steps is present on the island, involving the [[Broken Isle Mural]], 5 ponds of adjustable water level and the 5 pillars and buttons in the shallow waters north of the teleport waypoint. See the Mural Lake Puzzle section of this article for a walkthrough.

===Nameless Island===
To the northeast towards [[Twinning Isle/1.6|Twinning Isle]] is an island with 1 Waverider Waypoint and 2 Echoing Conches. On the beach there is 1 Echoing Conch (Sudden Attack).

After completing a [[Time Trial Challenge]] involving destroying 3 Dodo-walls, a [[Wind Current]] will appear that can take the player to the top of the island. There the player will find an Echoing Conch (Where Duty Lies) and a wooden ship. Around the ship, they can pick up a [[Somewhat Rotten Wooden Plank]] as part of the [[From Outer Lands]] quest.

At the base of the mountain there will be another mural that the player can take a [[Photo Mode|photo]] of to obtain the [[Nameless Island Mural]].

===Stray Northwest Island===

==Mural Lake Puzzle==
===Walkthrough===
Use the [[Wind-Blessed Harpastum]] to break one of the Dodo-King's painted walls at the bottom of the island. This will lead to a cave entrance, and inside one can observe the [[Broken Isle Mural]] as part of the quest ''[[The Other Side of Isle and Sea]]''.

[[File:Quest The Other Side of Isle and Sea Broken Isle Mural.png|120px|right]]
There are 5 lakes located at the peaks of the island. For each lake, there will be two rock pedals that can be used to raise and lower the water level. There are 3 water levels (1 being empty, 2 being middle, 3 being full). The mural tells which level each lake should be at.
* South Lake: Level 1
* Southwest Lake: Level 3, one needs to break the Hydro [[Elemental Amber]] to fill the lake first
* Northwest Lake: Level 2
* Southeast Lake: Level 2
* Northeast Lake: Level 1, one needs to break the [[Rock Pile]] to get a waterfall to fill the lake. [[Elemental Sight]] can help locate such breakable rocks. This lake can be easily accessed from the southeast lake by activating the [[Windmill Mechanism]] to ride a [[Wind Current]] leading here.

After setting the lakes to the correct levels, head to the 5 pillars located at the north of the island. In front of the pillars there will be 5 rock pedals. The player will have to step on these pedals in a specific order. Each pillar will be marked with a number of stripes from 1 to 5. These tell the order to step on the pedals:
#South pedal
#Southwest pedal
#Northeast pedal
#Northwest pedal
#Southeast pedal
After doing this correctly, three [[Chests]] (one Luxurious and two Precious) will spawn. There will be a cutscene, and some steel drum [[music]] will play. [[Paimon]] will say some dialogue too.
* The tune played by stepping on the pedals in the correct order matches the high tide alarm that plays at the beginning of [[Echoing Tales/Story#VII: Island Bygones|Conch Retrospection VII: Island Bygones - Incoming Tide]] in the Chinese audio. It is also a simplified version of the cutscene music, which is the beginning of one of the OSTs that plays during the day on the isle.
* If the lake is not filled with water, then there will be no tune when stepping on the pedals.

===Dialogue===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon interacting with the rock pedals near one of the mountaintop lakes without having interacted with the stone pedals by the five pillars)
:''<small>(If the [[The Other Side of Isle and Sea#Broken Isle Mural|Broken Isle Mural]] was already observed)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' The mural we saw below must be related to this pool somehow...
::'''Paimon:''' But we can't be sure how they're related...
:''<small>(Otherwise)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' The water level can be raised and lowered. Question is, what for?
::'''Paimon:''' The water level must be connected to something else around here.
::'''Paimon:''' Let's check this area out. Maybe we might find some clues!

;(Upon nearing a group of five pillars with rock pedals)
:'''Paimon:''' Those rocks look a bit... weird.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go take a look.

;(After stepping on a rock pedal)<!--plays regardless of whether or not you have interacted with a rock pedal near a mountaintop lake-->
:'''Paimon:''' Wha&mdash;? That rock made a sound when you stepped on it!
:'''Paimon:''' Felt like the whole island was rumbling...
----
;(Upon stepping on the rock pedals at the pillars in correct order)
:;(A cinematic begins)

:[[File:Broken Isle Mural Puzzle Tune.ogg]]

;(After the cinematic ends)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, it's like the whole island is making that noise. This tune's kinda catchy, huh...
:'''Paimon:''' Still, Paimon wonders what it's for. So strange...
