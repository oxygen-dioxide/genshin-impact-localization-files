==Description==
Every student in the school knew that the strict instructor was a serious soldier.<br>But every week, there would always be a day or two when the instructor would wear this yellow flower brooch on his chest.<br>The smile on the instructor's face would always bring the students a sense of relief.<br>For when the instructor wore the yellow flower brooch, it meant that they could take a day off and go home.<br>Once his boisterous students had finally gone, the instructor would visit a silent graveyard.<br>There, after a moment of silence, he would pay his respects to the familiar names carved on the tombstones.
