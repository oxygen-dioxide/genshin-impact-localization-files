|text      = Good news, good news! I just finished negotiating a super lucrative deal! Just thinking about all the Mora I'm gonna make... Ehehehe...

But, y'know, can't make the big Mora without a big bit of risk! This one is a particularly tricky business, crossing the entire desert to shift the goods. Without sufficient experience comes the risk of getting lost; without sufficient skills, there's no way to protect the goods.

Now, let me think, just who is the total package that meets both conditions? Why, that would be our famous [[Traveler]], of course!

As for the nitty-gritty deets... Nothing you need to worry yourself about, just leave it all to me. You just get the goods where they need to go, and it'll be raining Mora! Of course, I understand how difficult it must be for you to come all this way. As long as you stay at the hotels I recommend, you'll get 20% off on meals and lodging, and even get complimentary desert travel rations and a big ol' water bottle! It's a total steal, wouldn't you say?

Limited-time offer, today only, and opportunity doesn't knock twice, so you'd best reply ASAP!
