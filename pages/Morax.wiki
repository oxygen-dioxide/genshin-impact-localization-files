'''Morax''', also known as the '''God of Contracts''' and '''Rex Lapis''', is the current [[Geo]] Archon and a member of [[The Seven]]. He had been presiding over [[Liyue]] prior to revoking his providence in the last Rite of Descension.

Along with [[Barbatos]], he is one of The Seven's two original members who are still alive at the start of the game. He currently wanders the world, disguised as a mortal man who goes by  [[Zhongli]], a consultant of the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]].

He goes by a plethora of names and titles, including the Prime of [[Adepti]], the God of Contracts, the God of Commerce, the Warrior God,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Organization Known as Wangsheng}}</ref> and the Groundbreaker.<ref name="Geo Travel Diary" />

Prior to his retirement, Rex Lapis descends in his Exuvia form during the annual Rite of Descension to give guidance to his people for a prosperous year and dictate trade, which is the region's focus.

===Introduction===
{{Quote|The [[Mora|currencies]] that flow through this land are my flesh and blood.<br />For thus did I become the guarantor of the people's hard work, wisdom, and future.<br />This is the trust I have placed in them. Betray it, and you taint my blood.|Morax, in the description for [[Prithiva Topaz Gemstone]]
}}
Rex Lapis is the God of Contracts, Commerce, and the Warrior God &mdash; among many other names. He was the [[Geo]] Archon and is the oldest of "[[The Seven]]," and possibly being one of the oldest, if not the oldest, gods at over six thousand years old. He is shrouded in a plethora of legends; both true and exaggerated, often depicting him as an all-conquering, powerful deity.

In addition to forming the geography of the [[Liyue|region]] he governs, Rex Lapis defended Liyue in great battles such as the [[Archon War]], which was waged in the area that is now [[Guili Plains]] against other gods. In one battle, he successfully defeated an ancient god known as [[Osial]], using massive stone lances to imprison the sea god, which is now known as the [[Guyun Stone Forest]]. In another, he sealed the Mountain Dragon [[Azhdaha]] under a tree in [[Nantianmen]] following the dragon's rebellion. Other beings Rex Lapis has fought and slain include the [[Chi]] that lived in [[Qingce Village]] and the god that was [[Xiao]]'s former master.

Morax is also the source and namesake of [[Teyvat]]'s currency, [[Mora]]. Morax's [[Gnosis]] was used to mint Mora at the [[Golden House]] before he retired from his position as Archon and ceded his [[Gnosis]] to the [[Tsaritsa]].

Currently, Rex Lapis resides in [[Liyue Harbor]] as [[Zhongli]] and works as a consultant at the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]].

===Personality===
Little is known about Rex Lapis' personality before becoming an Archon, but descriptions and legends about him depict a deity much different from the one known by the people today. During the [[Archon War]], it is said that none could ascribe gentleness to him, and that his nature was that of boundless slaughter.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Mask of Solitude Basalt}}</ref> [[Venti]] &mdash; the current form of [[Barbatos]], a longtime friend of Rex Lapis, and the only other remaining member of the original Seven &mdash; describes Rex Lapis as a "brutish blundering buffoon" and an "old block-head".<ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|More about Venti: III}} and [[Venti/Voice-Overs#About Morax|About Morax]]</ref> Morax, in turn, sees him as a "drunken fool that is a disgrace to the arts".<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|About Venti}}</ref> Due to his old age, Rex Lapis frequently reminisces about memories and experience.

As the God of Contracts, Morax seems to value contracts above all, as it is fair, and equivalent exchange. It is hinted that he had slain the other gods in the Archon War in the name of contracts,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Summit Shaper|Lore}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, Sweet Salt}}</ref>and even as Zhongli, he is sworn to never go back on a contract.
However, despite being the God of Contracts, Rex Lapis recognizes that all situations are different &mdash; and therefore, "justice" may vary depending on the situation. He also doesn't mind "little maneuvers" behind the scenes. Surprisingly, he takes no offense to [[Keqing]]'s criticisms of Liyue's dependence on him; in fact, it turns out that he even agrees with her sentiments.

Morax is very slow to adapt to change, but nonetheless accepts it as inevitable, something which most of the adepti have had trouble adapting to. He had originally convinced himself that Liyue would still need him, but after hearing a merchant tell a worker that they were done for the day while going incognito, began questioning himself, and set up an elaborate trial to see if Liyue could survive without his guidance. This is true even well after assuming the identity of Zhongli, where he continually thinks in the old ways,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Keqing|About Zhongli}}</ref> albeit having some change every once in a while.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xinyan|About Zhongli}}</ref>

===Appearance===
During formal events such as the Rite of Descension, Rex Lapis takes the form of a half-{{w|Chinese dragon|dragon}}, half-{{w|Qilin|lin}} creature.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of Descension|note=chinese localization}}</ref> However, based on other depictions of him, he typically takes a human-like form.

[[Statues of The Seven]] in Liyue depict him as an adult man wearing a hood and robes wrapped around his legs, holding a cube. In [https://youtu.be/Wv-Tr-sSoCs Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti], his back is shown, donning a white robe with a hood and wearing long, wide pants. His hands are depicted orange, with vein-like markings traveling up his arm. He has long, dark brown hair tied back into a long rattail, with the rest being style in  wind-swept fashion. His hair fades into a bright amber at the ends of his rattail.

The ''[[Rex Incognito]]'' series claims he changes forms frequently depending on the situation (having appeared in the form of different men and women throughout history) but always has bright amber eyes in any form he takes. This is assumedly the trait that follows him throughout all of his forms, however Zhongli hints that Rex Lapis has a "true appearance."<ref>Web Event: [[Stone Harbor Treasure Journal/Story|Stone Harbor Treasure Journal]]</ref>

==Story==
===History===
How he came to be is currently unknown, however he descended to Teyvat approximately 6000 years ago. After he descended, he lowered the tides and raised [[Mt. Tianheng]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref>
Before the [[Archon War]], Morax was already known as the Lord of [[Geo]]. He was close with [[Guizhong]], the Goddess of Dust, and they formed a settlement for their people in [[Guili Plains]], which was named after them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1)}}</ref> He was also on good terms with [[Guoba|Marchosius]] and [[Madame Ping]]. However, after the Archon War broke out, Guizhong perished in a battle that laid waste to Guili Plains and [[Dihua Marsh]]. Afterwards, Morax moved their people south of [[Mt. Tianheng]], to the place that is now [[Liyue Harbor]].

To protect his new city, Morax formed a contract with the [[adepti]] to defend the harbor as he continued waging war against his many enemies. Baqiu,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Primordial Jade Winged-Spear|Lore}}</ref> [[Chi]], [[Osial]], and [[Xiao]]'s former master were defeated by his hand, while [[Havria]], too gentle for this brutal period, was slain by her own people. The survivors of [[Sal Terrae]] were spread throughout [[Liyue]], many of them coming to Liyue Harbor. At some point, he befriended a [[Azhdaha|massive dragon]] and gave it sight, who became a lifelong friend, but the dragon eventually deteriorated from "erosion" and he was forced to seal his old friend away underneath [[Nantianmen]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|The Unforged|Lore}}</ref>

After defeating the other gods, he sealed them underground, where their physical bodies decomposed and became one with the earth. Their souls, however, were immortal; their desire for revenge and lust for life seeped into the earth, resulting in miasmas, plagues, monster attacks, and other such calamities. To quell these disturbances, Morax summoned the [[Yaksha]]s to aid him in battle, endlessly subduing the ancient gods.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref><ref>Story Teaser: [https://youtu.be/Wv-Tr-sSoCs Yakshas- The Guardian Adepti]</ref>

As the Archon War came to a close 2,000 years ago, Morax emerged as one of the seven victors. The Seven would dine together in Liyue. Morax also met [[Makoto|Baal]]'s ''kagemusha'', [[Ei|Beelzebul]], during one of these meetings. Two millennia later, only Morax and Barbatos remained as the original Archons amongst The Seven. The other five died and were eventually replaced.

Morax's level of involvement in the [[Cataclysm|catastrophe]] 500 years ago is currently unknown, but he is aware of how greatly it affected the [[Tsaritsa]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Downtown}}</ref> An unknown party later made a contract with him in which he would not disclose the truth of the incident to anyone who might ask.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref>

===Present Day===
{{main|Zhongli/Lore|Chapter I}}

In the [[Archon Quests|Archon Quest]] {{Nowrap|[[Chapter I]]}}, {{Nowrap|[[Of the Land Amidst Monoliths|Act I]]}}, {{Nowrap|Part I}}: ''[[Rite of Descension]]'', Rex Lapis is purportedly assassinated during the titular Rite, and his vessel &mdash; known as the Exuvia &mdash; was taken away to the [[Golden House]] by the [[Liyue Qixing]].

In the Archon Quest {{Nowrap|Chapter I}}, {{Nowrap|Act III}}: ''[[A New Star Approaches]]'', it turns out that he took on the form of Zhongli and instigated most of the events of the chapter with the aid of the Tsaritsa and her envoy, [[Signora]]. This was designed to be a test to see if Liyue was ready to move on without his protection, as he intended to retire from his position as the Geo Archon. He gave his [[Gnosis]] as part of his contract with the Tsaritsa, which he called "the contract to end all contracts".

At some point prior to the [[Rite of Parting]] &mdash; but after handing his Gnosis over &mdash; Morax used an ancient adepti art to inform both his fellow adepti and the Liyue Qixing that he was still alive, but had chosen to step down as the Geo Archon, thus dissuading suspicion placed upon the [[Traveler]] for his "murder".<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* There are mysterious markings on his statue that have not yet been translated, [[Languages#Liyue Language|although they do bear some resemblance to somewhat-eroded modern Liyue writing]].
* In the last part of the quest ''[[Three Poignant Perfumes]]'', it was shown that he likes the smell of [[Fate's Yearning Perfume]], the one which was preferred by mature women.
{{Transclude|Zhongli/Lore|zhongli|section=1}}
* {{Character Furnishing Mentions}}

===Etymology ===
* In the demonology grimoire ''{{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon}}'', "Morax" is one of the twelve Presidents of Hell and the 21st demon, ruling over thirty (or thirty-two according to other authors) legions of demons. He teaches astronomy and other liberal sciences and gives good and wise familiars that know all herbs and precious stones' virtues. He is depicted both as a man with the head of a bull and a bull with the head of a man.
* His Chinese title, {{zh|岩王帝君|rm=Yánwáng Dìjūn|tl=Imperial Sovereign Yánwáng; Stonelord Sovereign; Rex Lapis}} includes the honorific title {{zh|帝君|rm=dìjūn|tl=sovereign,}} typically added to the names of Daoist deities.<ref>Google Books: [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aeMTAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA405#v=onepage&q&f=false "What The Master Would Not Discuss"]</ref>
** "Rex Lapis" is thus thematically tied to the Chinese theme of the Liyue region and its [[Adepti]] (who are Taoist immortals), contrasting the ''Ars Goetia'' theme of his name "Morax."
* Two of Morax's titles, "God of Wealth and Prosperity" and "God of War," are ascribed to {{w|Kubera}} and {{w|Vaiśravaṇa}}, two names for the deity who leads the yakshas in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist mythology.
