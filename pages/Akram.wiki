==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Akram:''' You must know yourself as well as your enemy to win every battle, wouldn't you agree?
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean?
::'''Akram:''' With the [[Corps of Thirty]] around, pickpockets wouldn't dare come around often.
::'''Akram:''' As you've seen, I'm a member of the Corps of Thirty. Naturally, we're responsible for keeping the peace in [[Sumeru City]].
::'''Akram:''' Theft, meanwhile, is the most common crime we see in the more crowded parts of the city.
::'''Akram:''' How else can you catch a thief except by being familiar with how a thief thieves?
::'''Akram:''' When my younger brother sees me occasionally — VERY occasionally, mind you! — simulate a theft in action, he always exposes my technique.
::'''Akram:''' How am I supposed to improve that way!?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Akram:''' Yeah, see you later.
{{Dialogue end}}

== Trivia ==
* According to both his and Farooq dialogues, it seems that they are twin brothers and Akram is the older one.
