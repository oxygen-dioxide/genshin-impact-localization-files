{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ayten:''' [[Dehya]]'s so awesome when she swings her huge sword around like that &mdash; "whoosh"!
:'''Ayten:''' If I could do such things, I'd go to the city, make Mora, and eat all the stuff I want!
:'''Karima:''' Huh? Do you wanna leave this place, Ayten?
:'''Ayten:''' Yeah! All the older kids are leaving one by one, so life out there has got to be better, right?
:'''Karima:''' Umm...
:'''Karima:''' But I'd rather become someone like [[Candace]]...
:'''Karima:''' She's beautiful and strong, and she's gonna protect us forever!
:'''Ayten:''' Well, that doesn't sound too bad either.
:'''Ayten:''' Well, how about this, then? I'll move to the city and earn loads of Mora... and that'll give you the Mora to stay here and protect the village!
