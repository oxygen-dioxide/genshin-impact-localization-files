==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ayten:''' [[Dehya]]'s so awesome when she swings her huge sword around like that &mdash; "whoosh"!
:'''Ayten:''' If I could do such things, I'd go to the city, make Mora, and eat all the stuff I want!
:'''Karima:''' Huh? Do you wanna leave this place, Ayten?
:'''Ayten:''' Yeah! All the older kids are leaving one by one, so life out there has got to be better, right?
:'''Karima:''' Umm...
:'''Karima:''' But I'd rather become someone like [[Candace]]...
:'''Karima:''' She's beautiful and strong, and she's gonna protect us forever!
:'''Ayten:''' Well, that doesn't sound too bad either.
:'''Ayten:''' Well, how about this, then? I'll move to the city and earn loads of Mora... and that'll give you the Mora to stay here and protect the village!

:'''Ayten:''' Hmm... I've had candy, seen the flowers... Next...
:'''Karima:''' Next? What's next on your list?
:'''Ayten:''' Hehe... I wonder if there's any weaponsmiths around here? I want to buy a sword, the bigger the better!
:'''Karima:''' Huh!? But... That's dangerous... And could you even lift it?
:'''Ayten:''' If I can't, you're here to help, right? The two of us should be able to carry it back to Aaru Village!
:'''Karima:''' Then... Then I also have something I want to buy! And you have to help me carry it, Ayten!
:'''Ayten:''' Heh... Say no more. I already know exactly what you want.
:'''Ayten:''' Don't worry. We'll pick you out a shield every bit as awesome-looking as Candace's.
