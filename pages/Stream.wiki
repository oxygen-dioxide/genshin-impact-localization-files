==Profile==
Stream is an exceptional singer and a member of [[Firecracker]]'s band. He developed Fading Disorder after the [[Calligraphy Tavern]] shut down, causing him to lose his sense of rhythm, but later recovered with the help of the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], and [[Nilou]].

===Appearance===
Stream is an origami frog with a green body that fades to yellow at the ends of his limbs. He has orange eyes, an orange belly, and a lotus leaf sitting atop his head.
