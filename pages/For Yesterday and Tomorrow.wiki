{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Este)
:'''Paimon:''' Este, we're back!
:'''Este:''' Oh, if it isn't... Wait, no. Who are you?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? You can't have forgotten us already! We're {{Traveler}} and Paimon!
:'''Este:''' {{Traveler}} and Paimon... I have indeed heard tell of these names, but I could've sworn I heard them in a dream!
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... But you were definitely awake then, Este! Also, while we were below, didn't we even see...
:'''Este:''' *sigh* I dreamed that everyone in town was petrified, turned into statues of stone, leaving me utterly helpless and alone.
:'''Este:''' Until finally, two brave heroes came and shouldered the burden of rescuing everyone... Could it be, that it was no dream at all?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe, maybe not.
:{{DIcon}} That's not important.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah. After all, everyone's back to normal now, aren't they?
:'''Este:''' But it seems as though everyone had some very strange dreams indeed. Just what happened? Could we all have been hypnotized en masse?
:'''Paimon:''' It would take us ages to explain it all properly... Just forget about the hypnosis thing for now!
:'''Este:''' Oh? Speaking of hypnosis, you two even brought over a cat! It looks quite intelligent.
:{{DIcon}} He's even smarter than he looks.
::'''Paimon:''' And moreover, he's our companion! But unfortunately, we can't take him with us on our journey...
:{{DIcon}} He's our companion.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true, but we still can't take him with us on our journey...
:'''Este:''' Well now, isn't that a coincidence? Our club just happens to have an open bed for cats available. It's been unoccupied ever since that [[Grispan|hypnosis researcher]] went a-traveling and took [[Grobel|his cat]] with him.
:'''Este:''' If you two don't mind, leave him here with us. We'll take care of him.
:'''Este:''' Though I can't quite put my finger on it, I feel like we're bound up together, almost as if by fate. I'll help you take very good care of him indeed.
:'''Este:''' The cattery is on the other side of the building. Just walk over and you'll see it.

;(Talk to Este, optional)
:'''Este:''' The cattery is on the other side of the building. Just walk over and you'll see it.

;(Interact with the cattery)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, this'll be your home from now on, Osse!
:'''Osse:''' Meeeow?
:'''Paimon:''' Still, it feels a bit weird. Cassiodor should've already left here, right? So who is Osse now?
:'''Paimon:''' Is it the original cat that hadn't been indwelt by Cassiodor, or is it the Monsieur Os that shared all those adventures with us...? Ugh, Paimon's brain is cramping up.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, you're really not suited to thinking about stuff like this.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't get it at all...
:{{DIcon}} "Osse" is "Osse."
::'''Paimon:''' Though Paimon still doesn't get it, it does make a certain kind of sense...
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, we've found a new home for Osse now, too! If we've got time, maybe we can come play with him!
:'''Osse:''' Meow meow!
