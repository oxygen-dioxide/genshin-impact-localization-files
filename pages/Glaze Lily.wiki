==Descriptions==
{{Description|An extremely ancient flower, said to have once been a common sight in [[Liyue]]. It transforms the memories of the land into its fragrance during florescence. Legend has it that the flower will open at the sound of pure, beautiful music, and that there was once [[Guizhong|one]] who loved this flower more than any other. Now, however, the sight of a Glaze Lily in full bloom out in the wild is a rare one indeed.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* Glaze Lilies will bloom from 18:00 to 6:00 in-game time.
* Some Glaze Lillies are found outside of Yujing Terrace and Qingce Village:
** A small group is found near the [[Teleport Waypoint]] of Liyue Harbor's Chihu Rock.
** A lone one is located on [[Mt. Tianheng]], overlooking the city.
** Some are found in [[Yaodie Valley]] and its caves.
** A lone one is found near [[Mt. Xuanlian]].
* The plant carefully listens to people's singing. This was explained by [[Madame Ping]] during the {{Quest|Farewell, Archaic Lord}}.
* The Glaze Lilies present in Liyue Harbor are artificially planted versions; they were originally prevalent throughout Liyue, especially in [[Dihua Marsh]], until overpicked, with very few existing in the wild.
** According to Madame Ping, when Glaze Lilies grew in the wild, a type of soil called Shimmersoil could be found. By digging beneath thriving Glaze Lilies and following the roots, one had a chance to find a small patch of Shimmersoil. This soil is used in the construction of the [[Serenitea Pot]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part I}}</ref>
** Wild Glaze Lilies have a stronger scent than the variety grown by people.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref>
** It is not known if the Glaze Lilies in Qingce Village are also artificially planted. Nonetheless, for in-game purposes they are all treated the same.
* During the {{Quest|Tuned to the World's Sounds (Quest)}}, [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] uses Glaze Lilies to repair the [[Ancient Zither]] by extracting the juices and applying them to the body of the instrument.
