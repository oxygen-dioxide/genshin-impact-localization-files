{{Description|An extremely ancient flower, said to have once been a common sight in Liyue. It transforms the memories of the land into its fragrance during florescence. Legend has it that the flower will open at the sound of pure, beautiful music, and that there was once one who loved this flower more than any other. Now, however, the sight of a Glaze Lily in full bloom out in the wild is a rare one indeed.}}
'''Glaze Lilies''' are a [[Local Specialty]] of [[Liyue]] found in [[Liyue Harbor]] and [[Qingce Village]].

==How to Obtain==
Glaze Lilies grow exclusively in the terraced fields of [[Qingce Village]] and in a few areas of [[Liyue Harbor]], mostly in Yujing Terrace but not exclusively, as a small group is found near the [[Teleport Waypoint]] of Chihu Rock and a lone one is located on [[Mt. Tianheng]], overlooking the city.

See the gallery or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=38 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Glaze Lilies after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
*[[Madame Ping]] in [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Liyue]] (5 Glaze Lilies)

==Trivia==
*Glaze Lilies will bloom from 18:00 to 6:00 in-game time.
*The plant carefully listens to people's singing. This was explained by [[Madame Ping]] during the [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]] quest.
*The Glaze Lilies present in Liyue Harbor are artificially planted versions; they were originally prevalent throughout Liyue, especially in [[Dihua Marsh]], until overpicked, with very few existing in the wild.
**According to Madame Ping, when Glaze Lilies grew in the wild, a type of soil called Shimmersoil could be found. By digging beneath thriving Glaze Lilies and following the roots, one had a chance to find a small patch of Shimmersoil. This soil is used in the construction of the [[Serenitea Pot]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part I}}</ref>
**Wild Glaze Lilies have a stronger scent than the variety grown by people.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref>
**It is not known if the Glaze Lilies in Qingce Village are also artificially planted. Nonetheless, for in-game purposes they are all treated the same.
*During [[Tuned to the World's Sounds (Quest)|Tuned to the World's Sounds]], [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] uses Glaze Lilies to repair the [[Ancient Zither]] by extracting the juices and applying them to the body of the instrument.
*The following birthday mails included Glaze Lily:
**[[Birthday/Ningguang#Fragrance of Blessings|Ningguang's 2021 Birthday Mail]] (1 Glaze Lily)
