==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Amauta:''' Ugh, so much to do... Eh, but that's probably a good thing.
:{{DIcon}} Is more work good?
::'''Amauta:''' It depends on what kind of work you have to do. For me, having more work is undoubtedly a good thing.
::'''Amauta:''' Well, you see, I'm the one responsible for making and repairing sports equipment for our tribe.
::'''Amauta:''' Things like hooks, locks, and protective gear. If you need anything, just holler. You'd basically be supporting my business.
::'''Amauta:''' And, well, the more business I have, the more people there are hoping to get their hands on my equipment.
::'''Amauta:''' But that's always better than having no customers at all.
:{{DIcon}} Pretty fulfilling life.
::'''Amauta:''' Well... That wasn't quite what I was thinking, but you're also not wrong.
