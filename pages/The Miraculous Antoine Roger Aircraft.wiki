'''The Miraculous Antoine Roger Aircraft''', or simply the '''Antoine Roger Aircraft''', is an exploration mechanic found in [[Fontaine]].

To operate the aircraft, the player must use the [[Pneumousia Block|Ousia block]] nearby to react with the Pneuma engine on the aircraft. When operating an aircraft for the first time, after the aircraft begins to rise, the player must deal with obstacles along the way &mdash; such as rebalancing Arkhe levels, clearing [[Floating Anemo Slime]]s out of the area or repelling attackers. Some Arkhe events may require the player to fight enemies to obtain an Ousia Block, though players can skip these fights by bringing an Ousia-aligned character.

The {{Quest|Interactive Tour}} also features the Antoine Roger Aircraft.
