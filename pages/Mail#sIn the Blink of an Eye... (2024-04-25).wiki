|text      = A few days ago, [[Changsheng]] and I made a trip back to [[Chenyu Vale]] and happened upon a tea tree that I had planted in my youth, now fully grown and thick with leaves.

The year I left the Vale, it was yet so small that I could have held it in the palm of my hand... Truly, it is astounding how swiftly time flies.

The leaves were tender and ripe for the picking, so we availed ourselves of the opportunity to gather quite a few. In Liyue tea culture, there is the expression "first harvest" &mdash; it signifies that the newest tea is reserved for the most important of guests. Should you have some time to spare, why don't you come down to Bubu Pharmacy and try some for yourself?

"Don't forget to come &mdash; Even [[Qiqi]] keeps asking to invite you first."

P.S. Changsheng had me add this for her. She's still practicing holding a brush with her tail.
