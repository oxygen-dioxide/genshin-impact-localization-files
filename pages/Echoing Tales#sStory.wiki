===VI: Familiar Voices===
The conches of the sixth set will only become active as collectibles after [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait]] has been completed.

Before this stage, they can still be encountered at their locations, however all of them just say ''"(They conch carries the soft, distance sounds of the waves...)"'' as they haven't yet "copied" a voice.
