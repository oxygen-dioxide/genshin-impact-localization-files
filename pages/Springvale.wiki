==Descriptions==
{{Description|A peaceful and idyllic suburban town. It has a long history of hunting, of sweet spring water, and of passing down the legend of a beneficent spirit dwelling within the waters.|Viewpoint, [[Land of Clear Springs]]}}
{{Description|A sleepy little village to the south of Mondstadt, that sits facing the lake that surrounds the city.<br>Most of the village's residents are hunters that provide fresh meat for all the big restaurants of Mondstadt.<br>Springvale's rustic appeal attracts many tourists. If you are lucky in your travels, you may come across a restaurant that truly knows how to bring out the best qualities of Springvale's meat.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}

==Lore==
According to legend, the town was formed when a mother brought her deathly ill son to an empty well, where a [[Spring Fairy|fairy]] filled the well with life-saving water.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona|5}}</ref> The miracle drew people to the area until a settlement was built over the spring and has remained there since, becoming Springvale. While the spring is actually melted snow and ice from [[Dragonspine]],<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Olaf}}</ref> the "fairy" that resides in the spring is very much real and is an [[Oceanid]] from [[Fontaine]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (I)}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* If for some reason the game encounters an error while in the open world, such as an error that results from the character moving out of bounds, then the game will teleport the player back to Springvale and rollback progress to before the error occurred.
