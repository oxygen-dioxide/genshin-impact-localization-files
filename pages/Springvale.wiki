==Lore==
According to legend, the town was formed when a mother brought her deathly ill son to an empty well, where a [[Spring Fairy|fairy]] filled the well with life-saving water.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona|5}}</ref> The miracle drew people to the area until a settlement was built over the spring and has remained there since, becoming Springvale. While the spring is actually melted snow and ice from [[Dragonspine]],<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Olaf}}</ref> the "fairy" that resides in the spring is very much real and is a [[Lochfolk]] from [[Fontaine]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (I)}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* If for some reason the game encounters an error while in the open world, such as an error that results from the character moving out of bounds, then the game will teleport the player back to Springvale and rollback progress to before the error occurred.
