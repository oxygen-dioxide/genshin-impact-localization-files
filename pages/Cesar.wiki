'''Cesar''' is an NPC that appears in a flashback during {{Quest|The Forgotten Thief}}.

==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Cesar was a well-known magician in [[Fontaine]] who enjoyed performing for the masses. He took on [[Lorenzo]] as an assistant to help him with his tricks. The public adored him, especially children who wanted their wishes to become true. At some point, he entered a relationship with [[Jemma]], unaware that she was intending to use him as a scapegoat for her crimes.

Ten years before the events of the game, Cesar was approached by Lyney and [[Lynette]], who sought him out in order to learn more about being a magician. Cesar was worried about where their parents were and told them that learning magic was hard, but after seeing their seriousness, accepted them without hesitation. He was unaware that they were actually part of the [[Fatui]], as the twins had approached him in order to perfect their tricks; while they had some talent, Lyney knew that without the guidance of a professional magician, their skills would plateau, and they needed the assistance in order to perfect their own tricks for the missions given to them by [[Arlecchino]].

During the ten days Cesar spent with them, he noted their natural talent and told them not to call him "Master", seeing them as the real geniuses. He was also able to discern that they were far too mature for their age and guessed that they had to grow quickly, though not wanting to know what befell them. He also noted that both Lorenzo and Jemma were agitated by their presence, the latter telling him that their eyes were far too "sharp" for her liking. Eventually, he discovered that they had lied to him and had a feel for their personalities, discovering that they were not like other children and had hard and dangerous lives, which made him upset that he could not do more to help them. He decided to cheer them up by telling them that as magicians, they would have to find their own truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods, though he believed they did not pay too much attention to them.

Cesar then decided to go on tour, asking the twins to come with him, but they declined, as they had to help their "Father" out with their missions. Cesar toured Fontaine and attempted a high-drop trick at the [[Opera Epiclese]]. However, when he performed the trick, he discovered too late that he had been sabotaged, and rather than the dummy falling out from the box, he did. He immediately died upon impact with the ground, and after the [[Gardes]] searched his belongings, discovered that he was the Phantom Weasel and closed the case, tarnishing his legacy. Jemma, who sought to frame Cesar as the Phantom Thief, noticed Lorenzo's anguish and conspired with him to kill Cesar, who had his own motives too; he felt that he was not getting the attention and wealth he deserved for helping Cesar and chose to eliminate him, as he posed too much of an obstacle for him to be a magician.

When Lyney and Lynette returned from their missions, they learned of Cesar's death and his subsequent identity as the Phantom Weasel, though both doubted the notion, knowing that he was far too benevolent to do so. Years later, they concocted a plan to draw out the true Phantom Weasel with the [[Traveler]]'s help and discover the truth of the incident. Once Lorenzo was apprehended as the Phantom Weasel, Cesar's legacy was restored and Lyney held a memorial service for him. The following day, the twins realized that Jemma was the true Phantom Weasel and cornered her, and when she asked why they had gone so far for her, Lyney told them that he and Lynette would never forget acts of kindness to them, having taken Cesar's words to heart.
