==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tavernier:''' Maybe I should pick another place...
:{{DIcon}} Pick another place?
::'''Tavernier:''' I mean somewhere else to do business.
::'''Tavernier:''' I'm a merchant from [[Fontaine]]. I focus on fine clockwork machinery and luxury goods.
::'''Tavernier:''' I stayed in [[Mondstadt]] for a while, but it's too laid-back for me.
::'''Tavernier:''' I thought Sumeru as a country of wisdom would boast laws and orders as strict as Fontaine. I never expected such a lax and unsophisticated atmosphere here!
::'''Tavernier:''' The only thing not so lax is the trade supervisors who are always making trouble for me.
::'''Tavernier:''' I'm just selling stuff from Fontaine, why do they keep questioning me?
::'''Tavernier:''' They wouldn't be so naive to expect me to spill my business secrets, would they?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Tavernier:''' Farewell. I wonder if [[Snezhnaya]] would be better...
