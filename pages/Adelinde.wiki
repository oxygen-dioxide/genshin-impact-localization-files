{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Adelinde:''' Greetings, welcome to Dawn Winery.
:{{DIcon}} Master [[Kaeya]]?
::'''Adelinde:''' You know him? I trust he's doing well for himself lately.
::'''Adelinde:''' If you're asking about the title, that's all in the past...
::'''Adelinde:''' Sorry, that was a slip of the tongue... Please disregard it.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Adelinde:''' I am the head housemaid. Please come to me if you ever need help with anything at the winery.
::'''Adelinde:''' My work? Just housekeeping. Most of the time it's just cleaning the rooms and taking out the trash, nothing strenuous.
::{{DIcon}} What can you tell me about the rumors?
::'''Adelinde:''' Was it [[Moco]] and [[Hillie]] you heard that from? *sigh* It sounds like they've been telling tall tales to the guests again...
::'''Adelinde:''' Don't take them too seriously. Nothing they tell you is worth paying too much attention to.
::'''Adelinde:''' Did you really think there could be quite so much drama... Heh...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Is that how it is...
:::'''Adelinde:''' Haha, you're overthinking things, that's just nonsense.
:::'''Adelinde:''' ...Ah, yes. How's your appetite been recently?
:::'''Adelinde:''' I made some extra steaks today. If you're not picky, please take them.
:::'''Adelinde:''' Like I said, don't overthink it. These are perfectly normal animal steaks. There's nothing wrong with them at all... *chuckles*
