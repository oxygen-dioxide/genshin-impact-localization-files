==Profile==
Pallad is a member of the [[Adventurers' Guild]]. In Venti's Story Quest, Pallad is seen drinking with [[Kaeya]], [[Diluc]], and [[Hardworking Silio]]. While Kaeya and Diluc bicker, Pallad notes that Diluc kept the vase Kaeya gifted him.

During the [[Unreconciled Stars/Story|Unreconciled Stars]] event, Pallad accepts a commission to investigate the meteorites on his own. However, several monsters eventually show up which caused Pallad to flee.

In Act IV of The Chalk Prince and the Dragon event, Pallad was rescued by [[Sucrose]] after he entered [[Dragonspine]] without proper preparation. When he tried to leave by himself, he was unable to leave because he was unprepared to handle the bitter cold. He later mistook the [[Festering Desire]] as a fire and knocked it into the ground, accidentally reviving a [[Cryo Regisvine]] and [[Resurgent Cryo Regisvine|empowering it]]. He was later escorted off the mountain by Sucrose.

Pallad later attends [[Cyrus]]' Dragonspine training event.

===Personality===
As his nickname suggests, Pallad is a reckless adventurer, being woefully unprepared for every situation that an adventurer should be ready for. Despite being a member of the guild for some time, he is incapable of fighting off even simple monsters such as [[slimes]]. He is only interested in getting fame and riches.

===Appearance===
Pallad is a fairly tall man with medium-length hazel hair. His hair is kept in a low, thin ponytail with messy bangs swept to the left side of his face, nearly covering his eye. His eyes are almond-shaped and blue, with a pair of thick, bold eyebrows. Pallad wears the standard Adventurers' Guild male uniform. The uniform consists of two layers of shirt (a long-sleeve white shirt with mandarin collar and a green laced up vest), green vambraces, a red necktie, a green cape collar with a ruffled trim and a triangular back flap, a buckled belt, knee-length green pants with red accents, brown stockings and laced leather shoes. The Adventurers' Guild logo, an eight-pointed star, is printed on the right and back flaps of the collar.

==Trivia==
* Reckless Pallad was originally supposed to be encountered outside of quests as he has an unused voice-over:
** {{A|VO Reckless Pallad 01.ogg}} "Rest a little longer..."
