==Profile==
According to [[Félix Yogue]], Babisse and his brother [[Mécantre]] are currently working on a "super-sized cannon [...] that [...] shall fire missiles that can fly high enough to touch the stars of [[Teyvat]]... all while carrying people inside." Félix also says that they are still searching for a suitable fuel type for their project and notes that they are likely rather downcast at the moment.<ref name="Felix EMP">{{Ref/NPC|Félix Yogue|s=Evermotion Mechanical Painting}}</ref>

===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''[[Canticles of Harmony]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Babisse:''' I must find a way to resolve these structural issues, post-haste...
:{{DIcon}} What issues?
::'''Babisse:''' I'm designing a high-speed aquabus, but there's just one problem...
::'''Babisse:''' After a period of high-speed operation, its internal components begin to vibrate intensely, damaging them...
::'''Babisse:''' I've tried switching materials many times, but the problem remains. Is the problem with my design, then, or the materials?
::{{DIcon}} Could I see that aquabus?
:::'''Babisse:''' Eh? Well, the trial versions are all in my lab. I came out here to...
:::'''Babisse:''' To... Uh... find... materials...
:::'''Babisse:''' The God King even... assigned me a guard to... to... conduct research under his glorious banner... such happiness...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Babisse:''' See you. Farewell... outlander...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Babisse:''' You have to... We have to look up at the sky and cease obsessing over Mora and tall towers. An empty space is where a researcher truly belongs...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after completing ''Daydreams Beyond Space and Time''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Babisse:''' Speaking of cannonballs, the bigger the better, wouldn't you say?
:{{DIcon}} What would you need such a large cannonball for?
::'''Babisse:''' Well, for people to sit in, of course, and soar into the skies via the giant cannon's propulsion!
::'''Babisse:''' My design would have the cannonball be internally hollow, such that two... or even three people could sit inside.
::'''Babisse:''' We'd need thick cushioning as well, so that we don't injure ourselves slamming into the walls of the projectile when it's fired.
::'''Babisse:''' Of course, we'll also need adequate food, water, and a Kamera...
::{{DIcon}} Wait, wait! What will such a huge cannonball be made of?
:::'''Babisse:''' Hmmm, well, this is exactly the problem I meant to solve.
:::'''Babisse:''' I've prepared several experimental material types, and I plan to use each to make a projectile, each with small animals as... passengers.
:::'''Babisse:''' *sigh* Speaking of which, I must thank that gentleman for his "high-speed aquabus" idea. It's given me tons of inspiration.
:::'''Babisse:''' It's not exactly the same sort of "speed" as the cannonball's, of course, but there are still design ideas here that I can gainfully refer to.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Babisse:''' Farewell! I wonder what material I should use to make this cannonball.
