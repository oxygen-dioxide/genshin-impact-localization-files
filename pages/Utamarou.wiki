{{Lang|'''Utamarou'''|ja=歌麿|ja_rm=Utamaro}} is a famous [[Inazuma]]n artist.

==Profile==
Utamarou's paintings are well known across Inazuma and have since been mass-produced to the point that they are cheap household curiosities. The [[Traveler]] has apparently seen [[Yoimiya]] using one as kindling, [[Thoma]] using one to pad a table leg, and [[Sayu]] using a stack of them as a cushion.<ref>Traveler's Voice-Over: [[Traveler/Voice-Overs/Inazuma#About the Artist Utamarou|About the Artist Utamarou]]</ref>

[["Kichiboushi"]] also claims to have seen Utamarou drawing in the past, saying that Utamarou took a very long time to produce one work.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Blazing Poetry}}</ref>
