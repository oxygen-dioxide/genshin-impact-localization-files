:'''Elham:''' If only cutting fabric were as easy as stabbing sea beasts with scissors...
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Elham/Remnant Sea Creatures|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Elham:''' I won. It's nice to play Genius Invokation TCG once in a while...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Elham:''' Eh, it's very difficult to play cards...
:{{DIcon}} Cutting fabric?
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
::'''Elham:''' Yeah, I have a tailor shop that's well-liked by the locals.
::'''Elham:''' Business has been good, but... I'm not satisfied with my tailoring skills.
::'''Elham:''' My regular customers just praise the clothes I make all the time, and when I ask them if they have any suggestions, they all say they don't have any.
::'''Elham:''' The dressmaking skills I can learn from the [[Akasha System|Akasha]] are limited, and I can't get any constructive customer critiques. If things keep going this way, I'll never be able to improve my design skills!
::'''Elham:''' I've recently been considering going to [[Fontaine]] for further training. I heard that there are some very good couture stores there.
::'''Elham:''' ...But I also heard that Fontaine produces mostly machine-made clothing and they hardly need craftsmen. What should I do...?
:{{DIcon}} Cutting fabric?
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::'''Elham:''' Yeah, I run a tailor shop that's well-liked by the locals.
::'''Elham:''' Business has been good, but... I'm not satisfied with my tailoring skills.
::'''Elham:''' My regular customers just praise the clothes I make all the time, and when I ask them if they have any suggestions for me, they all say that they don't have any.
::'''Elham:''' The number of dressmaking techniques that could be learned from the Akasha were very limited, and customer suggestions are nowhere to be sought...
::'''Elham:''' The way things are going, I'll never improve my fashion design skills!
::'''Elham:''' That's why I've recently been considering going to Fontaine for further training. I've heard that there are some very good couture stores there.
::'''Elham:''' ...On the other hand, I've also heard that Fontaine produces mostly machine-made clothing, which means that they hardly need craftsmen. What should I do...?
:{{DIcon}} Use scissors to... stab sea beasts?
::'''Elham:''' Ahaha, that's... purely by accident.
::'''Elham:''' One time, when I was a child, I was playing on the beach, when a sea beast attacked me.
::'''Elham:''' I was playing house and making clothes with small scissors, and all of a sudden a huge sea beast charged at me.
::'''Elham:''' I didn't think twice and stuck my scissors into its eyes...
::'''Elham:''' The sea beast ran away immediately after getting hurt. I didn't know what was going on, but the people on the beach held me up and gave me the title of Sea Beast Killer...
::'''Elham:''' To this day, people still thank me for what I did back then. Perhaps that's why they visit my tailor shop so often.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Elham:''' See you.
