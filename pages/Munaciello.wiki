:'''Munaciello:''' Hello, I'm Munaciello the "Porter." Do you know the rules?
:{{DIcon}} What rules?
::'''Munaciello:''' Hehe, fresh fish, I see.
::'''Munaciello:''' Don't worry, Munaciello the "Porter" never cheats his customers.
::'''Munaciello:''' You've got questions, I've got answers. We'll exchange what you know for what I know &mdash; in equivalent amounts, of course.
::'''Munaciello:''' That's how Munaciello the "Porter" rolls.
:{{DIcon}} A "porter"?
::'''Munaciello:''' I transport information from one place to another, just like how sailors carry goods.
::'''Munaciello:''' Information's like futures &mdash; no capital, no profit.
::'''Munaciello:''' And trust me, I've got capital to spare &mdash; Munaciello the "Porter" won't run low on cargo to transport, believe you me.
:{{DIcon}} Y&mdash;Yeah, I'm good.
