==Abilities==
{{Stub|1.5% Fury per hit was determined with manual testing (66-68 hits to self-destruct), but not confident on how many hits were counted}}
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Erosion
|desc_1      = When the Eroding Avatar of Lava is hit by a {{Pyro}} attack, it will gain '''1.5%'''{{Verify}} [[Fury]]. When the Fury bar reaches '''20%''', '''40%''', and '''60%''', it will take {{Color|True Physical DMG}} equal to '''25%''', '''20%''', and '''15%''' of its Max [[HP]] respectively. When the Fury bar is full, the Eroding Avatar of Lava is automatically defeated.
* '''Local Legend:''' This ability is disabled.

|name_2      = Melee Combo 1
|desc_2      = Performs two horizontal punches and one downward smash, dealing '''50% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

|name_3      = Melee Combo 2
|desc_3      = Performs a diagonal punch and one downward smash, dealing '''60% ATK''', '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}, and sending a wave of rocks forward, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. Repeated hits by the wave have their DMG reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_4      = Rock Throw
|desc_4      = If the player is far away, throws a large rock at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

|name_5      = Rolling Smash

}}

===Local Legend-Exclusive===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Double Protection
|desc_1      = Possesses both a {{Geo}} [[Ward]] and a [[Fury]] bar. The Ward is weakest against [[Blunt Attack]]s, and the Fury bar will fill upon being hit by {{Pyro}}. The Ward protects the Local Legend from all DMG when active. If the Ward is destroyed, but the Fury bar is not fully filled, the Local Legend will become damageable but with high [[RES]]. When the Ward is destroyed and the Fury bar is filled, the Local Legend's RES will return to normal.

|name_2      = Earthshaker Strike
|desc_2      = Enlarges its fists and performs three consecutive ground smashes, dealing '''50% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. This attack is only used when at least one of the two protections are active.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A strange monster that must continually absorb heat to stay in an active state.<br>The ancient civilization used many different types of golden designs to drive the flow of phlogiston, allowing massive constructs and magnificent cities to operate under the wisdom of the golden patterns. It is said that in addition to machines with fixed structures, the creatures known as Avatars of Lava are actually badly damaged lifeforms that were once created in the same way. However, after the flames of the sacred mountain were extinguished, most of them lost their sense of purpose and direction.|[[Archive]]}}
