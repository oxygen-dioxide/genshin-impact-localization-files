|description    = An urban area filled with goods and wares, from strange and precious treasures to everyday items, recreating the bustle of [[Liyue]]'s markets.<br>"Glittering" here is no overstatement, for Liyue is the place where all ships go and all stocks flow. As such, the vast majority of its citizens do not want for necessities. But if something is indeed lacking, you can wait for the end of the month to send feedback to the [[Keqing|purple-haired young woman]] who often roams the markets during that time. Her true identity is unclear, but what is known is that most goods brought to her attention will soon appear on the markets.
