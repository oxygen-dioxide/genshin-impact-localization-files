|text      = [[Dahlia]] didn't send the sisters to chase me down for morning prayer today. Knowing him, I'd say this was his idea of a birthday gift. And honestly, it's just what I needed.

But a quiet birthday alone? That's hardly perfect.

[[Mondstadt]] has many famed wines and the best flavors don't always come from the tavern. Take [[Springvale]], for example. Some hunters there uncork their private winter brews when the frost sets in. I can understand the sentiment: after a long, shadowed wait, crouched in the cold, a few sips of something strong are a well-earned reward, catch or no catch. Oh, and their roasted meat? Not bad at all.

So, what do you say? Care to grace me with your company and share some tales of your heroics?

To you &mdash; I'll drink to that.
