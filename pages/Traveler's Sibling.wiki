The '''Traveler's Sibling''' is the lost twin sibling of the [[Traveler]] and the supposed leader of the [[Abyss Order]]. The primary goal for the Traveler in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' is to find and reunite with their sibling &mdash; traveling through [[Teyvat]], obtaining information about them from meeting with [[The Seven]].

The gender and name of the sibling depend on the player's choice at the beginning of the game during their fight against the [[Unknown God]]. If the player chooses male, the lost sibling is a female named '''Lumine''', while if the player chooses vice versa, the lost sibling becomes a male named '''Aether'''.

==Appearance==
The physical appearance of the sibling is nearly identical to the [[Traveler]]. Both are slim young adults with blond hair, golden-yellow eyes, and lightly tanned skin. Lumine's hair is medium cut with short, straight twin-tails; while Aether's is medium cut with a long braid.

Lumine wears a pale white sleeveless dress with blue lines and tail capes, with gloves covering her thumbs. Also, she wears white stockings and boots; and Aether wears a dark breastplate vest and black boots, with dark brown pants, a white scarf and a two-tailed cape with golden embroidery and decals.

It is revealed that certain parts of the Traveler's clothing light up based on the current element they are attuned to. In the opening cutscene, both siblings are seen with glowing white clothing and yellow wings. However, though they retain their glowing white clothes, the sibling has yet to show use of any of the Seven [[Elements]] in or out of combat.

In the [[Archon Quest]], [[We Will Be Reunited]], they are shown wielding the same [[Traveler's Original Sword|white-gold sword]] as in the opening cutscene, but now it glows with dark energy.

==Personality==
The sibling has a vendetta against the divine after finishing their journey across Teyvat for reasons unknown. They are solely devoted to accomplishing the goals of the Abyss Order regardless of what has to be done to do so. Despite their questionable actions, the sibling still cares for the Traveler, as they express a desire to return home with them after finishing their goals and convinces them to continue their journey across Teyvat to witness the truth themselves rather than forcing their views on them.

==Story==
During the beginning cutscene in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'', both siblings are fighting against the [[Unknown God]]. Depending on which gender the player chooses, they will have a name attached to them and will become the [[Traveler]]. The other sibling ('''Lumine'''  or '''Aether''') will then be attacked by the Unknown God and be sent away in the form of a cube. The Traveler will then continue to fight before being subdued and having their powers sealed away, sent to wander the land until they come across [[Paimon]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/ShB3vNlSdDA Opening Cutscene]</ref>

Intelligence passed on from [[Kaeya]] and background history from [[Venti]] reveals that the [[Abyss Order]] has recently gained a new leader named the Prince or Princess.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When the Wind Dies Down}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> At this point, while the Traveler does not know who this leader is, the player can conclude that the Prince or Princess is the Traveler's sibling.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Reunion With the Dragon}}</ref>

In the story teaser trailer ''We Will Be Reunited'',<ref name="We Will Be Reunited">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/SO__VQZirJ4 We Will Be Reunited Trailer]</ref> the Traveler's sibling is depicted as Lumine. In it, she is shown traveling through Mondstadt carried by a [[Ruin Guard]] and is revealed to be behind the plot of the [[Abyss Mages]] to weaponize the dragon [[Dvalin]]. An Abyss Mage refers to her as "Your Highness" and proceeds to tell her about their foiled plan &mdash; she is shocked to learn from the Mage that her brother had a major role in foiling that plot. Later on in the trailer, she watches her brother fight [[hilichurls]] in the grounds of [[Stormterror's Lair]] from a higher vantage point unbeknownst to her brother. This same area is revisited by the Traveler and [[Dainsleif]] during the quest [[Bough Keeper: Dainsleif]] wherein the Traveler senses the previous presence of their sibling through the dandelion stepped on previously. There, Dainsleif finds a Ruin Guard's footprint nearby while also speaking vaguely about a "traveling companion" he had been with before. It is later revealed that the sibling was Dainsleif's travel partner, but due to currently unknown circumstances, they did not reach the end together.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion}}</ref>

In the Archon Quest, Chapter I - Act IV: We Will Be Reunited, the Traveler's sibling briefly meets with the Traveler in front of the [[Defiled Statue]] after an altercation between the Traveler and an [[Abyss Heralds|Abyss Herald]]. There, the sibling asks the Traveler to not stop them or the Abyss. The Traveler's sibling also reveals the truth of [[Dainsleif]]'s origins and that the monsters of the Abyss were formerly [[Khaenri'ah]]'s people before being transformed. The Traveler tries to persuade them to continue with their original plan, which the sibling agrees with, but after their war against the divine is over. The sibling then tells them to continue traveling Teyvat in the hopes of seeing the true nature of the world presided by the Seven and Celestia before leaving with the Herald through a portal.

At some point, the sibling visited [[The Chasm]] and saw dead hilichurls, who had gone inside to die in peace due to a water pool receding the curse's effects. Angered and upset by their needless suffering, they authorized the activation of a device that would supposedly amplify the water's effects to the point that the curse would be removed for good regardless of the success rate. If device worked, the sibling would then have the former citizens of Khaenri'ah rebuild their fallen nation. As expected, the device backfired before it was destroyed by [[Halfdan]] and the plan stopped by Dainsleif and the Traveler.

{{Character Mentions|Traveler's Sibling}}

==Trivia==
*While both Traveler and their sibling witnessed the fall of [[Khaenri'ah]] 500 years prior to the main [[Timeline|storyline]], it is speculated that the sibling had been conscious for far longer. This is due to the fact the sibling has traveled throughout the world of [[Teyvat]] at least once before becoming the current leader of [[The Abyss]].<ref name="We Will Be Reunited" />
*The color on the outfit of the Traveler that represents their current element has remained unchanged on the sibling's clothing; being bright white. This color was present for both siblings during their battle against the [[Unknown God]] in the opening of the story. (It is currently not possible for the Traveler to change back to the white colored 'element' on their clothing.)
*The Traveler's Sibling addresses the Traveler as "Aether" or "Lumine" regardless of the name the player chooses for them.
*Most official videos and art by HoYoverse that feature the Traveler have Aether fill that role, while Lumine takes the position of their sibling.
