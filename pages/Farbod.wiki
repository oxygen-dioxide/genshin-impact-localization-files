===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farbod:''' I pick [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]] every day. My waist is sore and my back aches...
:'''Farbod:''' And I'm only in my twenties!
:{{DIcon}} Sounds tough.
::'''Farbod:''' Ugh, no kidding. Picking mushrooms requires endless bending down. It gets real horrible after a while.
::'''Farbod:''' Luckily, the [[Akademiya]] requires a huge supply of Rukkhashava Mushrooms, so I gained a steady job from this.
::'''Farbod:''' My current goal is to save some Mora, buy a house in the city, and live there!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} About Rukkhashava Mushrooms...
:::'''Farbod:''' Rukkhashava Mushrooms are great stuff! You know by the name that they must be something amazing left by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].
:::'''Farbod:''' I think... uh, they can serve as cooking ingredients, herbs... well, and maybe fertilizer?
:::'''Farbod:''' Well, I'm not sure. Since the [[Akasha]] didn't tell me all its uses, I guess I didn't need to know.
:::'''Farbod:''' As long as the Akademiya needs it, I can always make money from it.
:::'''Farbod:''' The only thing I do know is that it's a great ingredient for cooking. Here are some for you. Take a try.
::;(Obtain [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]] ×4)
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the city...
:::'''Farbod:''' I've been living in the wilderness all my life, so I rarely get the chance to enter the city. Even my mushrooms are sent into the city via convoy.
:::'''Farbod:''' You seem like you've been to places. Can you tell me what city life is like?
:::'''Farbod:''' I heard city folk merely have to sing songs or dance to get some shiny Mora. Is that true?
:::'''Farbod:''' But isn't every Mora a piece of the Geo Archon's flesh? Why would they trade using an Archon's flesh?
:::'''Farbod:''' And what would they do without Mora?
:::'''Farbod:''' *sigh* It eludes me. Cities truly are mysterious.
:{{DIcon}} Take care of yourself.
::'''Farbod:''' Oh, yeah, you too.

::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'd like to know about Rukkhashava Mushrooms...
:::'''Farbod:''' Rukkhashava Mushrooms are great stuff! You know by the name that they must be something amazing growing only on old trees.
:::'''Farbod:''' I think... uh, they can serve as cooking ingredients, herbs... well, and maybe fertilizer?
:::'''Farbod:''' Well, I'm not sure. All I know is that as long as the Akademiya needs it, I can always make money from it.
