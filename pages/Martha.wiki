{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Martha:''' That suspicious guy from Sumeru... *sigh* I should keep Moce a bit farther away from him...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Martha:''' Hmm? Ah, welcome, guests from afar. I'm Martha Pasquale, the matron of Pasquale's Instruments.
::'''Martha:''' If you have any musical instruments you'd like to order, you can go straight to my husband, Giovanni.
:{{DIcon}} A suspicious person from Sumeru, you say?
::'''Martha:''' Ah yes, that guy over there. The name's... Chan... something? Ugh. I don't remember exactly, but it was hard to pronounce.
::'''Martha:''' He came into town some time back, claiming to be a researcher from Sumeru. Well, I've never seen him do any research. He just plays cards all day with the Doge's granddaughter...
::'''Martha:''' Can't figure out half the things he talks about normally either. "Moving statues" this, "voices in the walls" that... *sigh* Maybe we should get Ms. Contarini to investigate him...
:{{DIcon}} And Moce is...?
::'''Martha:''' *sigh* My mischievous son. Sorry if he's given you any trouble.
::'''Martha:''' That boy's been a restless soul since Giovanni told him about how his uncle sailed off to Sumeru. That's what you get when you fill a child's head with dreams of adventure...
::'''Martha:''' But what if one of those suspicious Sumeru folk reel him in, and then, and then... Ah! No, no, how horrifying! I can't bear the thought!
