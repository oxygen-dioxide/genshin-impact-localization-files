==Descriptions==
{{Description|A hardy beetle that dwells in the vast desert. Its shell has patterns on it that resemble those that dot the ancient desert ruins, hinting at some deeper relation between the two.<br />Legend has it that when the [[Scarlet King|desert king]] ruled this land, the souls of those vanquished by him would be sealed within these insects by the magically-skilled priests at great triumphs held in the City of the Pillars. The scarabs would then be charged with defending the sacred temples and palaces for all eternity in the name of Al-Ahmar. In the end, the temples would collapse and the palaces would fall, and only these golden insects would remain, fulfilling their ancient, forgotten oaths.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Scarabs are the first Local Specialties that are also categorized as [[Wildlife]].
