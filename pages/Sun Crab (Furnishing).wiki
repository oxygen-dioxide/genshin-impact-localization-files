|description    = A claw-snapping crab that can be found in various water bodies throughout [[Teyvat]].<br>The shells of these crabs are painted in many beautiful red shades, which wonderfully reflect the many stages of sunlight. Sometimes, they can reflect the daylight of the Realm Within. The resultant crystalline light sometimes startles the half-asleep [[Tubby]] awake.
