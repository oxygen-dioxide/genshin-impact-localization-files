|description    = A room based around a clockwork workshop with enough machinery processing equipment to meet most artisans' needs.
Some Fontainian poets believe that clockwork meka are creations worthy of respect, respect that should shine upon the artisan's tools as well. "Inspiration inclines the ears of these components, it teaches them to dance as one at a pace perpetual."
