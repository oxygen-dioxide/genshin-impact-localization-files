Please excuse me, I don't know how to properly express how I am feeling. I actually thought about it all day... My face feels hot, but I still can't find the right words. But if I don't take this opportunity to tell you, I know I will regret it for the next year.

No need to fret! This won't be about training or searching for evil spirits. I just wanted to take this time to casually chat with you. I want to tell you about the strange things that have been occurring and also hear about all the experiences you have had on your journey.

Besides, I feel that my martial arts has progressed slightly and I would like some advice from you regarding martial arts techniques.

I have already prepared enough popsicles! No matter what happens, I'll be in control and not ruin our gathering. I'll be waiting for you.
