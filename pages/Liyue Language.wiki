<section begin="Description" />The '''Liyue Language''' (unofficial name) refers to the local language of Liyue alongside the common language. Its written form is inspired by real-life Chinese characters, particularly {{w|seal script}}. Such script is common in [[Liyue Harbor]] around shops and other businesses &mdash; there is a very high degree of repetition of these symbols between shop signs.<ref group="Note">The sign for the Zhongyuan Chop Suey stall, the sign for the unnamed building next to this stall, the sign for Xigu Antiques and all legible characters on the scrolls, the signs for Yanshang Teahouse, the sign for the Dockyard, the signs for Mingxing Jewelry and all characters on the scrolls, the sign for Northland Bank, the hanging banners in Bubu Pharmacy, and the books at Wanwen Bookstore all share the same eight symbols. Notable exceptions are the last symbol on the banner for Wanmin Restaurant, and the symbols for Wanwen Bookstore.</ref> Other examples of this language can be seen on the [[Jade Chamber]] Intel Wall during the animated cutscene in the Archon Quest "[[Zhongli's Treat]]" and on bulletin boards around Liyue.<section end="Description" />

This script appears in several other Liyue character's Elemental attacks including: around [[Chongyun]] when [[Spirit Blade: Chonghua's Layered Frost]] is active, and when [[Zhongli]]'s [[Dominus Lapidis]] Stone Stele breaks.

A stylized (or ancient) form of the Liyue script appears in [[Beneath the Dragon-Queller]] on the ground around the seal after [[Azhdaha]] is defeated.

==Deciphered Characters==
There are few instances where characters in this script that have been deciphered and determined to be based on existing Chinese characters. In most cases, the characters closely correspond to {{w|seal script}}, an ancient form of the Chinese writing system.

A few characters appear in the center of the seal at the entrance to [[Beneath the Dragon-Queller]]. They are used to indicate which element Azhdaha will be [[Beneath the Dragon-Queller#Elements|infused]] with and are based on the Chinese seal script of these Elements: {{Electro}} {{Lang|zh=雷}}, {{Hydro}} ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=水}}), {{Cryo}} ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=冰}}), and {{Pyro}} ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=火}}). Note that the character for Electro has been simplified from its seal script form ({{Lang|mini=1|靁}}) by replacing the {{Lang|mini=1|zh=畾}} portion with the symbol for Electro {{Element|Electro|25}}.

Four characters also appear when [[Yanfei]]'s [[Seal of Approval|Charged Attack]] leaves an impression on the ground. These characters have been interpreted to be based on the Chinese glyphs for {{Lang|mini=1|zh=福|zh_tl=blessing,}} {{Lang|mini=1|zh=祿|zh_tl=prosperity,}} {{Lang|mini=1|zh=商|zh_tl=business,}} and {{Lang|mini=1|zh=印|zh_tl=seal" or "stamp}} (right to left, top to bottom).<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/nal34v/comment/gxunn83/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 Comment by u/SnooFoxes6169]</ref> The symbol identified as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=印}} is in fact identical to one seal script form of the character, while the other characters seem to be highly stylized.<ref group="Note">The symbol identified as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=印}} has not been seen in the game prior to Yanfei's release. The three other characters appear throughout Liyue.</ref>

There is also another Chinese character found in the game, which is the one on the [[Unusual Hilichurl]]'s mask. This character is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=伟|zh_tl=Wei,}} the name of the CEO of [[MiHoYo]]. This character, however, does not seem to be in the same style of script.
