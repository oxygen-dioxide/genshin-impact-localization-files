;(After talking to Temach the first time)
:'''Temach:''' We still have a few more flying challenges. Details are written on the board. Give 'em a try if you're keen... Of course, there are prizes to be won.
:{{DIcon}} About the [[Pakpaka Flying School]]...
::'''Temach:''' Honestly, I have no clue why it's called that. But speaking of Pakpaka... Have you ever heard the story of [[Kuntur]] and the evil sorcerer [[Rumi]]?
::'''Temach:''' The warriors of the tribe were defeated by that wicked mage, and he turned them into Pakpaka... which doesn't sound all that good. Maybe Pakpakas fly very quickly, or something &mdash; I don't know.
:{{DIcon}} About [[Lamizana]]...
::'''Temach:''' Haha... He's a good fighter, but not necessarily a good teacher. And as an opponent in flying competitions... I guess he's passable?
::'''Temach:''' But I mean, why would you come here if you didn't have issues with flying? So, if I were to be too strict... *sigh* Well, it's not like things like this have never happened in the past.
::'''Temach:''' That's why I focus on encouraging people nowadays. I'm sure that approach will get results just fine too.
:{{DIcon}} Gotta go.
::'''Temach:''' See you. You're welcome back any time.
