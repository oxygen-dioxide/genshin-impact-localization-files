The seven '''Elements''' of ''[[Teyvat]]'' are at the core of both [[Game System|gameplay]] and [[lore]] of ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

They act as special [[Status Effects]] and [[Damage]] types that can be applied in specific orders to trigger [[Elemental Reactions]].
The seven elements cover seven of the eight damage types, last one is ''[[Physical]]''.

Each element corresponds to an [[Archon]] and their own [[Teyvat#Major Nations|nation]] that worships said Archon. The nature of the relationship between an Archon and their element is unknown. Similarly, while regions are heavily affected by its element, the nature of their relationship is also unknown.

===Elemental Nodes===
{{Main|Elemental Node}}
Certain [[Domains]] and some parts of the overworld have '''Elemental Nodes''' or '''Infusion Stones''' that imbue nearby enemies with elemental affixes that can increase their offense and defense.

===Elemental Gauge Theory===
{{Main|Elemental Gauge Theory}}
This theory intends to explain Same Element Superposition, Elemental Reactions, Shield Breaking and other mechanics related to Elements.

==Lore==
===Elemental Authorities===
{{Main|Seven Sovereigns}}
The seven elemental Authorities were powers wielded by the Seven Sovereigns, the most powerful [[dragon]]s of the old world before the [[Heavenly Principles]]'s arrival. The Heavenly Principles stole portions of those powers, which were later used to establish the Archon's Authorities.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Calamitous Tread}}</ref> Visions, which are wielded by people in [[Teyvat]], are also derived from these Authorities.<ref name="NeuVision">{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision}}</ref>

===Elemental Energy===
[[Phlogiston]] is Teyvat's primordial form of energy and was used by the Heavenly Principles as a basis for the creation of Elemental Energy for the purpose of developing a power to better counter the [[Abyss]]. Elemental energy is considered the modern counterpart to Phlogiston.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref>

===Gnoses===
{{Main|Gnosis}}
The Heavenly Principles and an unidentified entity created seven Gnoses out of the remains of the Third Descender,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Finale}}</ref> one for each element, as a substitute for the Heavenly Principles's authority after it was gravely wounded in a great war.<ref name="NeuVision" /> The Gnoses are said to resonate with [[Celestia]] directly, and are more powerful than Visions. The [[Fatui]] are gathering the Gnoses, which are held by their respective elemental Archons, for an undisclosed purpose.<ref name="Ending">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref>

===Visions===
{{Main|Vision}}
Some beings in Teyvat are mysteriously granted Visions, which are external apparatuses that allow their owners to wield the elements. Visions take the form of crystals, each with the symbol and color of one element. Depending on the region in which they received their vision, they feature [[Vision/Gallery|ornaments]] characteristic of that region.

After a Vision wielder dies, their Vision becomes a Masterless Vision, losing its power and all indicators of its element. Sometimes, Masterless Visions will resonate with a new person. For this reason, Masterless Visions are a commodity sought by the extremely rich.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Ningguang|Vision}}</ref>

Vision wielders are secretly known by the gods as allogenes, people who have the potential to become gods in Celestia themselves.<ref name="Ending" />

==Trivia==
* {{Dendro}} was the only element which had no playable characters up until [[Version 3.0]], which added [[Tighnari]] and [[Collei]], as well as the Dendro-aligned [[Traveler]]. 
** [[Baizhu]], although in the game at the time with a visible Dendro Vision, appeared as an quest-exclusive character; he would be released as a playable character in [[Version 3.6]].
* The Traveler is the only character in the game whose element can be changed as a playable character. Resonating with [[Statues of The Seven]] from a particular region will cause the Traveler's element to change to the region's associated element (e.g., resonating with a Statue of The Seven in [[Liyue]] will cause the Traveler's current Element to change to {{Geo}}). 
** No other playable character can change elements, even if they can wield more than one element in the story, such as [[Tartaglia]] (who has a {{Hydro}} Vision and an {{Electro}} [[Delusion]], but as a playable character, only wields Hydro).
