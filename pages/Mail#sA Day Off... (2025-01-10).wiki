|text      = The Special Patrol's current training plan has been in place for a while now, and the results have been promising. It's about time to come up with an advanced training plan. I already have a few preliminary ideas in mind. The existing exercises can stay, but the standards for completion will need to be raised. As the weather gets colder, I'm planning to add a new challenge that tests both willpower and courage: winter swimming.

Since I'm off duty today, I'm gonna take a few laps in the water to test its feasibility. The route will be between [[Court of Fontaine]] and [[Marcotte Station]]. I've already cleared out the monsters along the shore, so that's a bit of a warm-up too.

I remember your swimming skills are pretty solid, and there's no doubt about your willpower and courage. How about a long-overdue swimming competition?

I'll ensure your safety, and as for the rewards... How about an extra large serving of [[Feast-O's]]?
