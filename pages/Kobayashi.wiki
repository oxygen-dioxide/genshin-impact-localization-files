==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:'''Kobayashi:''' Hmm? What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Where does this road lead?
::'''Kobayashi:''' There's a place called [[Konda Village]] up ahead.
::'''Kobayashi:''' ...Walk along the main road after leaving the village and you will find yourself near [[Inazuma City]].
::'''Kobayashi:''' Oh right. Do you have the permit to enter and leave Ritou?
::{{DIcon}} Permit?
::'''Kobayashi:''' I'm referring to the Travel Permit. It is a document issued by the Tenryou Commission or the Kanjou Commission that allows you to travel freely within Inazuma.
::'''Kobayashi:''' ...You don't actually have one, do you?
::'''Kobayashi:''' If you don't have one, just stay in Ritou.
::{{DIcon}} Travel Permit... do you mean this? ''(Available after obtaining the [[Travel Permit]] during [[Chisato's Letter]])''
::'''Kobayashi:''' Let me see... Yeah, that's the one. You are good then. You may pass here.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Kobayashi:''' Hey! You can't run around without a permit!

;(After completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:'''Kobayashi:''' Hmm? What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Where does this road lead?
::'''Kobayashi:''' There's a place called [[Konda Village]] up ahead.
::'''Kobayashi:''' ...Walk along the main road after leaving the village and you will find yourself near [[Inazuma City]].
::'''Kobayashi:''' Oh, yes. You don't have any contraband items on your person, right?
::{{DIcon}} Contraband items?
::'''Kobayashi''' Um, like... compasses that automatically search for treasure, bottles that allows you to fly, or boats armed with large cannons...and things like that?
::'''Kobayashi''' I mean, I'm just guessing, really. I'm honestly not sure what counts as contraband.
::'''Kobayashi''' And I mean, even if some dangerous does get through, they'll have to face the might of the Tenryou Commission when they're in the city!
:{{DIcon}} See you...
::'''Kobayashi''' You take care now.

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kobayashi:''' Hello, are you here to take part in the festival?
:'''Kobayashi:''' Ritou hasn't been this lively in ages, and we've got outlanders of all kinds walking the streets as well.
:'''Kobayashi:''' I'm going to go have a walk once I finish work. My luck's been pretty good so far, so who knows? I might just snag the grand prize.
