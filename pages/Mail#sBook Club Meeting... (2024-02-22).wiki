|text    = Recently, I've often found myself thinking about our hard-won peace, and how that now, as the Divine Priestess, I should be able to do more for the people than I ever could before.

I'd like to host a Book Club Meeting and invite the people of [[Watatsumi Island]] to join, and encourage them to read and share their favorite books. I've already made some preliminary predictions regarding the format and the effect I'd like to achieve, but I lack experience in matters such as these, and cannot guarantee that every detail has been comprehensively accounted for...

If possible, would you be willing to rehearse it with me?

We'll have a small-scale meeting as a trial run, with just the two of us as participants. This way, not only can I familiarize myself with the process, but we can also discuss our recent reading experiences together.
Please don't feel any pressure. Just consider it... a picnic with a literary accompaniment.
