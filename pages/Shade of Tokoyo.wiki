'''Shades of Tokoyo''', also known as "'''Sinshades'''" and '''afterimages'''<!--no capitalization in-game-->, are spectral [[NPC]]s that appear throughout [[Enkanomiya]] during [[Evernight]]. In the past, the people of Enkanomiya have also called them "Eidolons" and "Ghostfire Phantasms."

==Profile==
Due to its properties as a nether realm, Byakuyakoku sometimes projects shadows of the past based on remnant thoughts. Whenever the "[[God of Moments]]" looks upon someone at some point with favor, their feelings and memories will forever remain in this world.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Inazuma|Sinshades}}</ref> Powerful emotions called "Sins of Tokoyo" may manifest themselves into a unique [[ley line]] phenomenon known as "Sinshades" or "Shades of Tokoyo."<ref name="STDS">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref>

If an afterimage realizes that he or she is in fact a sinshade, he or she will disappear after a short amount of time<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Antigonus}}</ref>, as "to know sin is to be free of it." A notable exception is [[Aru]], a "sinless" Shade of Tokoyo created specifically to help facilitate the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]].<ref name="STDS" />

After the creation of the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], the people of Enkanomiya began to observe some special phenomena &mdash; the [[Sunfire Phantasms|mirages]] during [[Whitenight]] and the Sinshades during [[Evernight]] &mdash; which they indiscriminately referred to both as "Eidolons." It was not until the arrival of Orobashi that they were able to understand them and respectively named the mirages "[[Sunfire Phantasms]]" and the Sinshades "Ghostfire Phantasms".<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|5|In the Light, Beneath the Shadow}}</ref>
