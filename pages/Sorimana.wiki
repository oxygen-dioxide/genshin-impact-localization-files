==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sorimana:''' Hello there, do you need help? Weren't bowled over by a passing [[Saurian]], were you?
:{{DIcon}} Does that happen often?
::'''Sorimana:''' Shouldn't happen too often, in theory... It's true that some Saurians aren't particularly friendly, but they normally wouldn't attack us unless provoked.
::'''Sorimana:''' But there have been quite a few rumors about Saurians ramming into people near near the places where i usually drop off supplies.
::'''Sorimana:''' Speaking of which, I work for the [[Courier's Longhouse (Faction)|Courier's Longhouse]], and it's my job to leave regular drops of food and other supplies at the places where our Couriers tend to stop off.
::'''Sorimana:''' Some are for humans, whereas others have been specifically designed for their Saurian companions.
::{{DIcon}} They might've been attracted by food.
::'''Sorimana:''' ...Ahhh! That's a good point!
::'''Sorimana:''' If Saurians or wild animals began to expect food to regularly appear at certain places, it's certainly possible that they'd start hanging around there...
::'''Sorimana:''' And if they were starving, it's not impossible that they might end up charging into people...
::'''Sorimana:''' Thank you for helping me realize what might be going on! I'll have to think of a way of testing this theory out...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} How do we verify that?
:::'''Sorimana:''' Hmm... How about this, then? You take these and walk around the wilds a bit more. See if any Saurians crash into&mdash; err, I mean, approach you?
:::'''Sorimana:''' With your skills, you should be able to dodge them, right?
::;(Obtain {{Item|Delicious Saurus Crackers|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Nah, I'm doing fine.
::'''Sorimana:''' Great.
