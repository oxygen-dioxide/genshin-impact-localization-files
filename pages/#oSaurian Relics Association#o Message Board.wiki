===Ancient Qucusaurus Dragon Object===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Association Announcement:''' Congratulations to the Association Researcher and part-time Courier [[Hoa]] for successfully excavating an ancient Qucusaurus dragon object!
:'''Association Announcement:''' Based on our analysis, the ancient dragon object she found was a saddle used by the people on the territory of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] to stay firmly secured on their Qucusaurus mounts while diving.
:'''Message from the Involved Party:''' I just accidentally tripped and fell while delivering a letter, straight up cratered. I only found it because it was the thing I tripped over...
:'''Message from the Involved Party:''' Are you sure it isn't just... something some Qucusaur Rider lost recently?
:'''Association Announcement:''' Please trust the Association's judgment, as well as the instruments used to determine the age of the ancient dragon object...
:'''Association Announcement:''' In addition, even if this was equipment lost by some Rider... Just how badly would the Knight and Qucusaur have had to fall to bury the saddle that deep?
:'''Message from the Involved Party:''' So was my fall not bad enough then? I remember the Association's rules. Researchers must be compensated for work-related injuries...
:'''Message from the Involved Party:''' Where's my Mora!

===Ancient Tatankasaurus Dragon Object===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Association Announcement:''' Congratulations to the Association Researcher and part-time archaeologist [[Akeor]] and the traveling scholar [[Tahmures]] for successfully excavating an ancient Tatankasaurus dragon object!
:'''Association Announcement:''' Based on our analysis, this ancient dragon object was a specialized device used by the ancient people living on the territory of the [[Collective of Plenty]] to train their back muscles...
:'''Association Announcement:''' Analyzing the structure of such devices will help the Collective of Plenty improve their current fitness equipment, helping everyone stay fit and healthy and unleashing unlimited potential!
:'''Association Announcement:''' But be aware, ancient dragon relics are not to be sold to foreign merchants or research institutions. Ancient dragon relics are part of the heritage of Natlan, and must not leave our lands...
:'''Association Announcement:''' Surveying and mapping and conducting analysis within Natlan's borders is still permissible, but be sure to pay the relevant access fees to the Saurian Relics Association...

===Ancient Iktomisaurus Dragon Object===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Association Announcement:''' Good news! [[Tizoc]] of the Collective of Plenty successfully excavated an extremely valuable ancient Iktomisaurus dragon object!
:'''Association Announcement:''' Based on our analysis, this object, which was found near the territory of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], is related to early '[[Phlogiston]] Engraving' technology...
:'''Message from the "[[Speaker's Chamber]]":''' We thank the Association for their lasting efforts to excavate ancient dragon relics. This object will be used by the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame: Temple of Pax|Temple of Pax]] for academic research.
:'''Association Announcement:''' Nonono, it is we who should be thanking the Speaker's Chamber for your acknowledgement! Just the thought that we can contribute to the advancement of Natlan’s technology is enough to get us really fired up!

===Citlali's Divination Tools===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mysterious Message:''' I heard that last time, the Association dug up the witch [[Citlali]]'s divination tools out in the wilderness? Just where'd they put them... if we get too close, will the curse spread to us too?
:'''Association Reply:''' Dear Researcher, please, do not add fuel to the fire! Such groundless folk rumors must not be taken seriously!
:'''Association Reply:''' The existence of Citlali's curse is still a matter of great contention. And if you think about it, even if it did exist, it probably wouldn't spread beyond the Masters of the Night-Wind too easily, right?
:'''Another Person's Message:''' I've heard that Citlali isn't that scary at all. In fact, she's pretty easy to approach despite her station.
:'''A Third Person’s Message:''' ...[[Pyro Archon]] protect us. That casual attitude is her waiting for new victims. The second you actually show disrespect or fail to fear her, you're toast.
:'''Association Reply:''' Aren't these 'divination tools' just a few liquor bottles? We've sent someone to return them to her.
:'''Mysterious Message:''' You're done for. Isn't that the same as criticizing her in public for getting drunk and littering?
:'''Association Reply:''' I think she'll probably just scratch her head and say 'Hey, I don't recall any signs saying I can't throw away empty bottles here.'
