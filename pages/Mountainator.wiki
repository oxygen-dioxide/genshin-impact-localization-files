'''Safe Blasting Mechanisms 2156''', aka '''Mountainators''', are cannons in [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] that can be operated by the player to fire projectiles that deal {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}} and clear certain obstacles, similar to [[Kamuijima Cannon]] in [[Inazuma]].

==Lore==
The '''Safe Blasting Mechanism 2156''' cannons were developed by the Engineering Department for use in The Chasm and were nicknamed "Mountainators" by the miners. When the Chasm was sealed, the fuses and cannonballs in the underground mines were locked up into storage rooms and the keys were purposely hidden in non-obvious places, and then the entrance to the lower levels were blocked off with stone.

Originally the [[Chasm Exploration Team]] planned to use a certain [[Klee|demolitions expert]] from Mondstadt to re-open the lower levels, but, since she got grounded, the Chasm team and the Traveler instead had to use a Mountainator to clear the path.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Meeting New People... and Foiling Some Bandits}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Heavenly Stone's Debris}}</ref>
