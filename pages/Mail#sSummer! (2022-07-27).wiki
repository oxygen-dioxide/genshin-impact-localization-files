Summer has a very hot sun and long, long days.

Klee has more time to do the things she loves, and the summer adventures get hotter and more exciting!

This summer, Klee went on vacation with [[Alice|Mom]]!

Mom took Klee to see super beautiful scenery, and we did lots of fun things together.

Ta-da! Klee knew you'd be curious so I drew them all with my brushes. Klee will tell you their story the next time we see each other!

Oh, oh, Mom said that summer is the season to share joy and let your heart fly free. She also gave Klee a booklet that Klee can't read.

Hehe, here you go. Klee hopes you like summer as much as Klee does!
