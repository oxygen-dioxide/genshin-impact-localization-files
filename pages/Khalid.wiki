==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Khalid:''' Hello, welcome.
:{{DIcon|Souvenir}} What do you have on offer? <!-- ''<small>(Condition)</small>'' -->
::'''Khalid:''' All the jewels we currently have for sale have already been reserved.
::'''Khalid:''' You mean what we have in the shop? Most are from my personal collection and are just for display.

:{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself...
::'''Khalid:''' I'm an antique collector, and I sell jewelry here and there.
::'''Khalid:''' Precious antiques are worth treasuring, and their prices are also out of the budgets of ordinary people, so it's not about making sales for me.
::'''Khalid:''' What I do care about is whether I can get more vendors as discerning as [[Dori|Lord Sangemah Bay]] to supply me with the most valuable collectors' items.
::'''Khalid:''' ...That is to say, trading is more like my side business.
::'''Khalid:''' As for my main business... I suppose that would be to raise my son into a collector with taste as astute as my own.
::'''Khalid:''' [[Feresht]] is a gifted child. I'm certain he can become an even more renowned antiques appraisal expert than me.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Khalid:''' Take care, now.
