{{Quote|I once gave Candace some jewelry and told her to learn to enjoy life and find happiness outside of work. She replied that seeing the village in peace was enough to make her happy... Well, this guardian really has a unique way of enjoying life...|An exasperated comment from [[Dehya]], the Flame-Mane.}}
"That Candace... is a true descendant of [[Scarlet King|King Deshret]]!"

At a tavern in Sumeru City, a disheveled member of [[The Eremites]] exclaimed in fear.

The guardian with different-colored eyes has received the blessing of the gods and is able to summon a sandstorm that engulfs all enemies instantly.

A former member of the [[Treasure Hoarders]], who recently claimed to have quit, added that Candace can also summon the power of the desert. Every grain of sand is her scout and no one can escape from her grasp.

But a young adventurer who was about to leave for the desert looked surprised. He replied that Miss Candace, the guardian of [[Aaru Village]], was actually a gentle and caring person.

During a visit to Aaru Village, he had seen Miss Candace bring water and food to a hungry Treasure Hoarder, and arranged for another exhausted mercenary to rest in the guest room... In the eyes of this adventurer, "terrifying" is the last word one could use to describe this guardian...

Candace, who is far away in the Great Red Sand, was unaware of this little debate about her - although she doesn't mind what people think about her.

As the guardian of Aaru Village, it is her duty to protect the peace of the village.

As long as they abide by the rules of Aaru Village, anyone can seek refuge here and receive the help they need.

As for those who violate the rules and commit atrocities in the village...

Candace will personally ensure that they never harm the village again.

              --><p>They indignantly accused Uncle Anpu of undermining tradition and requested that Candace, the current Guardian, do her duty by summoning guards to drive the merchants out.</p><!--
              --><p>However, Candace refused the request, for she had already reached an agreement with the village head that the village must make changes for the future of its residents.</p><!--
              --><p>They kept explaining, but the former keepers did not relent, and it was even suggested that if Candace was unwilling to do her duty, they would take up arms again and carry out a Guardian's work themselves. At last, a clang of lance against shield silenced all the quarrels. With lance and shield in her hand, Candace stood up and looked around with a smile, before announcing to the stunned elderly folks around her:</p><!--
              --><p>"It is good to see you all in such good spirits."</p><!--
              --><p>"But I am the current Guardian of Aaru Village, so please, go and rest, as you should."</p><!--

              --><p>After a moment's preparation, Candace accompanied the village head in her station as Guardian to formally receive the caravan and hold trade negotiations with them, before personally escorting them out of the village.</p><!--

              --><p>This batch of merchants returned to Sumeru City with news of the success of the deal. Soon after, a new topic cropped up among the business-folk of Sumeru, one which had been rarely heard of in the past:</p><!--

==Trivia==
* Candace is the first {{w|Heterochromia|heterochromic}} character released in ''Genshin Impact''.
* The symbol on Candace's forehead is likely a reference to the symbol of the Millennium Items in the ''{{w|Yu-Gi-Oh!}}'' franchise, being virtually identical to the fictional symbol created in that series.
* As explained in her Character Story 1, Candace's title as a "descendant of King Deshret" is not a literal descendancy, but rather a term used to refer to all people of Aaru Village as it is the last bastion of his civilization, being as well a title which all Guardians of Aaru Village are known as.

===Etymology===
* Her name originates from Greek and Roman sources wherein the title {{w|Kandake}}, a term used for the sister of the King of Kush, was incorrectly assumed to be a hereditary proper name of the "Queen of the Ethiopians" and Latinized as "Candace." The most prominent such source is older translations of the Biblical book of Acts (Acts 8:27), but according to the Roman author Pliny the Elder this use was common in Roman literature.
*Her design references many Egyptian symbols, with the eye on her forehead a stylised version of the eye-symbols associated with the gods Horus and Ra, her heterochromatic eye similar to Horus where one represents the sun and the other the moon (though Candace's are reversed from Horus') a starry pattern reminiscent of Nut, goddess of the sky, a winged insignia on her shield reminiscent of symbols associated with the goddess Isis or the neckpiece worn by the Pharaoh Tutankhamun, and an Ankh worn around her neck.
*Candace's shield is said to be [[Candace/Voice-Overs#More About Candace: IV|blessed by Bennu]]. {{w|Bennu}} is an Egyptian deity associated with the sun, rebirth, and creation, and was often depicted as a heron. Earlier depictions of Bennu, however, appear more like the Yellow Wagtail. Similarly, Candace's skill and burst reference the heron and wagtail respectively.
