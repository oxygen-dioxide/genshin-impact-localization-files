'''Miso Soup''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The [[recipe]] for Miso Soup is available from [[Shimura Kanbei]] at [[Shimura's]] in [[Inazuma City]] for 1,250 [[Mora]].

Depending on the quality, Miso Soup restores '''8'''/'''9'''/'''10'''% of Max HP to the selected character and regenerates '''210'''/'''260'''/'''300''' HP every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].

When [[Thoma]] cooks Miso Soup, there is a chance [["Warmth"]] will be created instead.
