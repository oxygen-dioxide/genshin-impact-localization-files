==Gameplay Notes==
* The party member equipping this set must be the one to trigger the [[Elemental Reaction]], and must be on the field for the 4-piece bonus to activate.
** For example: If Fischl equips this set and leaves Oz on the field, but is switched out for another character before an Elemental Reaction occurs, the set's effect will not activate and your party members' Elemental Mastery will not be boosted.
* The 4-piece bonus effect ''does not'' stack with itself.
* The 4-piece set bonus effect is not activated by [[Swirl]]s on self, such as from the field of [[Dandelion Breeze]]. It's also not applied by other elemental reactions on self (e.g. [[Electro-Charged]]) even if self inflicted.
