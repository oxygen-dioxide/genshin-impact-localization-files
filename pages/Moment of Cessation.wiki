'''Moment of Cessation''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Pale Flame]].

==Description==
Money is the lifeblood of the world, and the pathways along which it flows are the world's arteries.<br />Then, the center of the world is a heart made of gold.

He was not one of the favored, and could only pursue worldly power.<br />But though money ought to mean nothing to the gods,<br />They held it firmly within their grasp nonetheless, along with the countless other forms of power that they wielded.

Perhaps he lusted for money because he had once been destitute,<br />Or perhaps the fact that the gods had never looked upon him with favor ignited a burning desire for resistance inside him...

"The people of [[Liyue|the land from which these coins hail]] revere contracts above all else."<br />"In the name of money, I shall respect the contract between us..."<br />"We shall, by whatever means necessary, become the heart that pumps money around the world."<br />"And, when the moment comes, that heart shall cease beating by our will alone."
