==Description==
A longbow used by a noble who ruled over [[Mondstadt]]. It was crafted with premium materials and master craftsmanship. For that reason, generations later, it is still as powerful as ever.<br />
Hunting was once a pastime of the nobles.<br />
They demonstrated their strength in the natural world, and shared the spoils with the people in benevolence.<br />
Unfortunately, benevolence was lost, and with it, their reign.

After the uprising, the [[Lawrence Clan]] that had long ruled Mondstadt was overthrown.<br />
In the name of benevolent governance, the newly established [[Knights of Favonius]] deemed that protracted investigations would be unnecessary.<br />
The Lawrence clan was promptly cast out from Mondstadt, never to return.

"On the road bound to our exile, I watched my father sigh with grief; at the betrayal of the people, at the end of a glorious era, at the final chapter of history."<br />
"We watched the people who were once our subjects rejoicing in the open country as we bid farewell to our homeland."<br />
"Only years later did I realize: it was we, the Lawrence clan, who had betrayed, who had ended a glorious era, and who had closed the history books. Only now was Mondstadt as it always should have been."

[[Vennessa]] was but the final push that toppled a crumbling tower.<br />
Before her, the flames of fury already burned bright, and occasionally the flickering flames had shone through the thick smoke of secrecy:<br />
The [[Parsifal|phantom thief]] praised in secret by the people. [[Blue-Eyed Spear Witch|The woman who could see death]]. The [[Wanderer's Troupe (Faction)|Wanderer's Troupe]] intent on revolution.<br />
The spirit of resistance is in Mondstadter's blood.
