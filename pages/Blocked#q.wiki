{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Anthony before defeating all the hilichurls)
:'''Anthony:''' Help! Heeeeelp!

;(Talk to Anthony after defeating the hilichurls without clearing the roadblock)
:'''Anthony:''' Whew. Thanks, Traveler...
:'''Anthony:''' But there's this roadblock here. I can't get through.
:'''Anthony:''' Haha... I would be able to sort this myself if the hilichurls hadn't just beaten the living daylights out of me. I'm aching all over!
:'''Anthony:''' But at least these medicinal herbs I gathered for Anna are still in good condition.
:'''Anthony:''' I'm sorry... I know this is asking a lot after what you've done for me already, but could you get rid of the roadblock for me?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Anthony:''' Thank you! I'm going to take a much-needed rest in the meantime...
:{{DIcon}} I'm on a tight schedule, sorry.
::'''Anthony:''' But Anna is waiting for me at home... Please, I really need your help.

;(Talk to Anthony after clearing the roadblock)
:'''Anthony:''' Now the way ahead is clear. Thanks, Traveler.
:'''Anthony:''' Anna's illness never fully goes away. But since we don't have much money, I often come here and gather what medicinal herbs I can.
:'''Anthony:''' I managed to get the herbs I was looking for, but then that bunch started attacking me out of nowhere. You got here just in time to save me.
:'''Anthony:''' This is for you. I make tea for Anna with it all the time, it helps with her coughing.
:'''Anthony:''' You seem like the outdoors type too. Make sure you look after yourself.

===Jack===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Jack before defeating all the hilichurls)
:'''Jack:''' Help!

;(Talk to Jack after defeating the hilichurls without clearing the roadblock)
:'''Jack:''' Traveler, it's you! Thank you so much.
:'''Jack:''' Can I ask you for a favor...?
:'''Jack:''' This roadblock here is the only thing getting between me and my adventure...
:'''Jack:''' Can you get rid of it for me?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Jack:''' *sigh* I wish I was more like you... I'd be a veteran Adventurer by now!
:{{DIcon}} I'd love to, but I have to get going.
::'''Jack:''' Please, I'm begging you... I can't let this be where my adventure ends!

;(Talk to Jack after clearing the roadblock)
:'''Jack:''' Thank you so much, Traveler.
:'''Jack:''' I was on my way to check out somewhere [[Stanley]] once went on an adventure. Had I known they would show up...
:'''Jack:''' I'm just not strong enough... I know for a fact that Stanley would have had no problem dealing with a group like that.
:'''Jack:''' Why don't you join me? Join me! ...Ugh, never mind, I can't have someone else doing my adventuring for me...
:'''Jack:''' I'm going to get moving. This is for you, I've gathered loads on the way to supplement my rations.
:'''Jack:''' ...Even though they're not exactly rations.
:;(Obtain [[Apple]] ×9)

===Myrana===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Myrana before defeating all the hilichurls)
:'''Panicked Myrana:''' H&mdash;Help me! Please!

;(Talk to Myrana after defeating the hilichurls without clearing the roadblock)
:'''Panicked Myrana:''' Th&mdash;Thank you, Traveler...
:'''Panicked Myrana:''' *sigh* First monsters, now this roadblock... It's hectic enough already back home, there was me thinking this would be a chance to get away from it all for a while!
:'''Panicked Myrana:''' I'm sorry, but is there any chance you could sort out this roadblock situation for me?
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
::'''Panicked Myrana:''' Thank you! I hope my two young ones grow up to be kind like you.
:{{DIcon}} I have other things to do.
::'''Panicked Myrana:''' Come on, please... I promise it won't take you too long.

;(Talk to Myrana after clearing the roadblock)
:'''Panicked Myrana:''' Th&mdash;Thanks so much, Traveler.
:'''Panicked Myrana:''' But please, don't tell anybody I got myself into trouble. My husband will give me an earful if he finds out...
:'''Panicked Myrana:''' Don't look at me like that... Wait till you're married, you'll see. A solitary stroll is a huge luxury when you're living with someone, you've got to make the most of it.
:'''Panicked Myrana:''' Here, take this. I picked some while I was out. Much cheaper to cook for yourself than eat at [[Good Hunter]]! You have to scrimp and save if you want to get by.
:;(Obtain [[Sweet Flower]] ×10)
{{Dialogue end}}

===Quinn===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Quinn before defeating all the hilichurls)
:'''Quinn:''' Help me! Please!

;(Talk to Quinn after defeating the hilichurls without clearing the roadblock)
:'''Quinn:''' Thanks for getting rid of them, Traveler.
:'''Quinn:''' Thank goodness you came. *sigh* But I'm stuck here while this roadblock continues.
:'''Quinn:''' If this keeps up much longer, all this fruit is going to go bad... after I spent so long gather it, too.
:'''Quinn:''' Can you get rid of the roadblock for me?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Quinn:''' Wonderful. I can't thank you enough!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I'm busy.
::'''Quinn:''' Oh... Really? I figured if you help someone out, you see it through all the way... Anyway, you're the only hope I've got.

;(Talk to Quinn after clearing the roadblock)
:'''Quinn:''' Thank you so much, Traveler.
:'''Quinn:''' My plan was to pick some fruit here then sell it back in the city.
:'''Quinn:''' I hadn't counted on being held up by a roadblock... and then set upon by that group.
:'''Quinn:''' Okay, I'm going back to Mondstadt. Do stop by the shop if you're ever in town!
:'''Quinn:''' Take these as a token of my gratitude. See how fresh they are? That's why [[Beatrice]] is always trying to buy them from me.
:;(Obtain [[Apple]] ×9)

==Trivia==
*It is possible to follow Myrana and Jack all the way from the quest location to their respective houses. Other characters may instead disappear after they reach a certain distance from the quest location.
*It is possible to speak to the victim before defeating all the hilichurls. One of the easiest ways is by defeating all but one hilichurl, then luring it away, and then running back towards the victim to lose [[aggro]], which will enable interaction with the NPC.
