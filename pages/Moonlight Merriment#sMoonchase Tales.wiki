| Take note of the Supreme Cuisine Machine's temperature at all times while using it to make gourmet dishes. If the temperature of the device is too high or low, the temperature meter will turn either red or green. If it remains in an over- or under-heated state for a few seconds, your current cooking process will fail. Maintain a normal temperature at all times and complete your culinary masterpiece with care!

| There are two pedals on the ground in front of the device. Stand on these pedals to shift the adeptal flame in the corresponding direction and adjust the heat on different mechanisms. When the adeptal flame is under a certain mechanism, its temperature will rise. A device that is not exposed to the adeptal flame will decrease in temperature.

| The Supreme Cuisine Machine's temperature will increase when it is exposed to {{Pyro}}. Conversely, {{Hydro}} and {{Cryo}} will decrease its temperature. Manipulate the elements to cook more efficiently.
