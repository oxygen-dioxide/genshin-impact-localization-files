{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Connor:''' Welcome to Dawn Winery! Are you here for a tour?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Connor:''' I'm Connor, a winemaker here at Dawn Winery. I've been here since Master [[Crepus]] was still in charge.
::'''Connor:''' Master Crepus was also Master [[Diluc]]'s father, the former owner of this winery.
::'''Connor:''' Unfortunately, Mr. Crepus died in his prime, and now the burden of running the winery falls on Master Diluc's shoulders...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about wine making.
:::'''Connor:''' [[Dandelion Wine|Dandelion wine]] is the signature product of our winery, offering a unique sweetish and refreshing taste, and rich in cereal aroma.
:::'''Connor:''' As to how it is produced, I suggest you seek the answers in "On Beer Brewing" and "Distillation Technology."
:::'''Connor:''' They are thoroughly written books and easy to find in the library. But Master Diluc has never read them, not even once...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Diluc.
:::'''Connor:''' Although Master Diluc appears to have little interest in wine,
:::'''Connor:''' I believe he bears the same talent in winemaking as his father, only waiting for the right time to reveal itself.
:::'''Connor:''' The question is, when will that time come?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Connor:''' Are you leaving? If you happen to meet Master Diluc...
::'''Connor:''' No, never mind... Please enjoy your stay at Dawn Winery.
