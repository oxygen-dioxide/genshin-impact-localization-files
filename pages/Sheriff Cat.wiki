{{Description|An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br />These cats are conscientious and cautious, elite hunters amongst their kind. Due to humans often delegating the vital task of defense against vermin to them, they are sometimes also called "watch-leaders." And though cats are free animals by nature, these "watch-leaders" take their rat-catching duties very seriously. In Liyue, such cats are fondly known as "Catcher-General Kitty," so much so that children's books and toys of this sort are quite popular amongst kids.|[[Archive]] Description}}

'''Sheriff Cat''' is a type of cat. It can be found both as [[Wildlife]] and as a pet for the [[Serenitea Pot]] which can be brought from [[Chubby]].

Cats cannot be killed and are passive towards the player. Attacking one will make it fling backwards, and some [[Elemental Skill]]s can make it run away and disappear. Approaching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[Archive]].

In the Serenitea Pot, cats behave like it does in the open world with the only exception of it being able to disappear.

Common animals can be placed in indoor and outdoor spaces within the Serenitea Pot.
