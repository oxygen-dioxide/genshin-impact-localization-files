'''Arayama''' is a historical figure of the Aranara. They, along with [[Araji]] and [[Aramaha]], sealed each of the three [[Ashvattha's Concourses]] with their own rhythms, and then turned themselves into [[Vasara Tree]]s. Arayama's Vasara Tree is located at [[Ardravi Valley]].

==Story==
Araji, Aramaha, and Arayama's friendship was comparable to the friendship of the three God-Kings: [[King Deshret]], the [[Goddess of Flowers]], and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Sapwood Blade}}</ref> According to [[Araminali]], Arayama used to stick together with [[Aranimba]] and Araminali and the three of them were so happy no matter what they did.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Static Views, Part 2}}</ref>

Arayama was noted to be not fond of Nara (human), and they used to create the phantasmal barrier to mess up the Nara. One day, one Nara saw though Arayama's Ararakalari, and despite their effort, the Nara easily bypassed any obstacle that Arayama created. Afterward, they became friends.<ref name="Beastly Trail">{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Reveals the Beastly Trail}}</ref> Their rhythm is "Rhythm of the Beastly Trail," which is able to remove illusion and obstacle caused by [[Claustroflora]].<ref>Tutorial: [[Tutorial/Rhythm of the Beastly Trail|Rhythm of the Beastly Trail]]</ref> Arayama created one such barrier for Araminali in order to protect their "happy nest."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Static Views, Part 2}}</ref>

Presumably during the [[cataclysm]], Arayama fought against the [[Marana]]. Afterward, they turned into a [[Vasara Tree]] inside a sealed Ashvattha's Concourse, and left their song behind as a method to unseal it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Encounter in the Woods|note=children quests}}</ref> Arayama had the idea of using flowers to hide songs, which they, along with Araji and Aramaha, all used.<ref>Tutorial: [[Tutorial/Rhythm of the Sprout|Rhythm of the Sprout]]</ref>
