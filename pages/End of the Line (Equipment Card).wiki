==Story==
{{Description|"...The fish that once shot forth like an arrow across a huge lake on the plateau,<br>That would stretch out as straight as a spear, cruising back and forth between the sacred sites,<br>Would see its stream seep into the sand, its lake shrink into a puddle,<br>Till at last, it wound up curled in a little plash, at the mercy of passing pilgrims."|title=Net Snapper: End of the Line}}
