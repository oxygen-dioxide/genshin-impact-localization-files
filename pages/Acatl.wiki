==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Acatl is the current chief of the Collective of Plenty. Unlike the other chiefs, the [[Traveler]] had not yet visited the [[Collective of Plenty]] and was not acquainted with him at the time.

When the Abyss invaded Natlan, Acatl and his tribe were able to repel the invaders. After [[Mavuika]] repelled the invasion, Acatl made his way to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] and was part of the audience conveying their blessings to the Traveler and the Pyro Archon when they descended into the Night Kingdom. Before the attack began, the Traveler spoke to [[Iansan]] in a resting area, where she asked them to visit her tribe when the war was over. Acatl told them that the tribe couldn't wait to meet them in-person.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Journey of Stars and Flames}}</ref> The two later emerged victorious, and Acatl took part in the celebrations.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Acatl:''' If it's something you believe in, just do it! That's our mindset here at the Collective of Plenty.
:{{DIcon}} Hello. ''(Available before completing {{cx}})''
::'''Acatl:''' Hello there, friend from afar!
::'''Acatl:''' Judging by your expression, this must be your first time here, so welcome! I'm Acatl, chief of the Collective of Plenty.
::'''Acatl:''' No need to feel on edge. We're not too concerned with formalities here &mdash; all that matters is courage, perseverance, and the strength of will never to back down in the ring.
::'''Acatl:''' Here at the Collective of Plenty, we show all valiant warriors and dear friends the respect they deserve. May your stay be a pleasant one.
:{{DIcon}} Hey there. ''(Available after completing {{cx}})''
::'''Acatl:''' Aha, we meet again! Welcome to the Collective of Plenty, my friend!
::'''Acatl:''' How's everything been going? Still as happy and well-fed as always?
::'''Acatl:''' Now that you're here, it's time to sit back and enjoy a bit of signature Collective of Plenty-style hospitality! C'mon, make yourself at home!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Don't mind if I do!
:::'''Acatl:''' Haha, no wonder they call you the hero of "hope." Our young lads and lasses from the Collective could learn a thing or two from your bold spirit!
:::'''Acatl:''' Now, prepare to witness the power of fine dining, Collective of Plenty style!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Harvest's Boon|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} About your mask...
::'''Acatl:''' Oh, you're interested in our masks? It's a time-honored wrestling tradition. The loser must remove their mask, while the victor keeps theirs on, retaining a sense of mystery that inspires others to step up and challenge them.
::'''Acatl:''' As for mine... I've never once been forced to remove it, whether I was facing a human or a [[saurian]].
::{{DIcon}} But... What if someone else tried to pass themselves off as chief?
::'''Acatl:''' Haha, a few of our young-uns have asked me the same thing. "If you're always wearing a mask, Chief, how would we even know you're not an imposter?"
::'''Acatl:''' The answer's simple &mdash; if you doubt who I am, come face me in the ring.
::'''Acatl:''' Words can deceive, writing can mislead, but muscles... never lie.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Acatl:''' Safe travels, friend!
