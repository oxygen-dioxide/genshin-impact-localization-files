==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You encounter a Qucusaurus attacking a human, but there seems to be more to this scene than meets the eye...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Mazkal)
:'''Infuriated Qucusaurus:''' &mdash;Shwaaaargh!
:'''???:''' Come on kiddo, come on now, quit fooling around. If you don't take your meds, you won't recover!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, she's in danger! We've gotta help her, {{Traveler}}!

;(After defeating the Qucusaurus)
:{{Black Screen|"Shwrawr!"<br>As if knowing it is outmatched, the Qucusaurus flies off with a cry...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Argh, it's quick! Gone in the blink of an eye!
:{{DIcon}} C'mon, Paimon, after it!
::'''Paimon:''' Wha&mdash; You want Paimon to go chase it? Seriously?
:{{DIcon}} Running away so soon? Come back... if you dare.
::'''Paimon:''' You think a [[Saurian]]'s gonna understand something like that!?
:'''???:''' ...Hmm, if nothing else, it does look like it's recovered quite nicely. Next, we should...
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, why was that Qucusaurus so mad?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Hmm, Paimon knows! You must've stolen its snacks! There's nothing more infuriating than a food thief, Paimon'll tell ya that!
:'''???:''' Snacks? Well, yes, I've had some, but Kururuk's not the type to get in a huff over small stuff like that.
:'''Paimon:''' "Kururuk"? So it has a name... Seems like it's got quite a temper on it, though! Almost hit you back there!
:'''???:''' Well, I wouldn't blame him, the treatment being what it is...
:{{DIcon}} So taking a beating is also a kind of healing? You learn something every day...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawr!
:'''Paimon:''' What? Come on, how did you get that into your head? Cut that nonsense out right now &mdash; you're giving {{Little One}} the wrong idea!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hroowr? Rrooh?
:'''???:''' Haha, if that was a workable form of therapy, I'd love to try it myself! Unfortunately, Saurians are different from us. Even if you told them something would help them recover quickly, there's no guarantee they'd understand.
:'''Mazkal:''' Ah, yes, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Mazkal. I usually take care of wounded or sick Saurians nearby. Not to brag or anything, but my medicines get pretty good client reviews.
:'''Mazkal:''' Hmm. Your little companion looks very healthy. Doesn't look like he needs my help.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so you're a Saurian vet! Uhh, judging from the way Kururuk behaved, seems like a pretty tough job...
:'''Mazkal:''' Oh, I wouldn't say it's all that tough. It's just that Kururuk's case is somewhat... special. He's deeply distrustful of humans right now, so he resists all treatments and medication.
:'''Mazkal:''' *sigh* If only I were a Saurian myself. I've observed him, and he gets along with other Saurians just fine. Perhaps he'd be willing to take medicine if it came recommended by another Saurian.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wroo?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, well if that's the case, we might just be able to help you!
:'''Mazkal:''' Huh? Wait, you're saying that despite your appearance, you're actually Saurians!?
:'''Paimon:''' You sure have an overactive imagination! Ugh...
:'''Paimon:''' A&mdash;Anyway, the real reason we can do this is because {{Little One}}'s a super clever little Saurian! He can help us out!
:'''Mazkal:''' Huh? He's that smart?
:{{DIcon}} Got a good eye for picking me as a companion, if nothing else...
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, sure, but that's not really the focus right now, is it?
:{{DIcon}} Smart enough to build bridges of friendship between humans and Saurians.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! Either way, you can leave this to {{Little One}}, no problem!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Mazkal:''' Then on Kururuk's behalf, let me thank you in advance, {{Little One}}!
:'''Mazkal:''' I've been worried that if he keeps acting up like this, it might not only prevent his old injuries from healing, but even cause new wounds to emerge... So I'm most relieved to have your help!
:'''Mazkal:''' I've formulated two different medicines for him. I've done my best to balance therapeutic effects and palatability, but I haven't come up with the perfect solution by any means...
:'''Mazkal:''' The result being that the more effective of the two medicines isn't as tasty, while the one Saurians love isn't quite as effective...
:'''Mazkal:''' Hmm... Well, instead of all this explaining, let's just have {{Little One}} take a sniff. You'll get the picture from how he reacts.
:'''Mazkal:''' Here's the more effective medicine.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wooo... Rrroo...
:'''Mazkal:''' And this is the less effective, but much more appetizingly-colored one.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, the difference really is obvious!
:'''Mazkal:''' No matter which one you use, the medicines will help Kururuk recover, so I'll just give you both of them. You can decide which you want to try!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Mazkal:''' Hehe, you're so reliable! Anyway, I'll head back to camp to make some preparations. As for Kururuk, I leave him in your capable hands!
:'''Paimon:''' Don't you worry, {{Little One}}'s got this!
;(Obtain {{Item|Medicine of Greater Efficacy}} and {{Item|Medicine of Superior Taste}})

;(After taking control of Little One)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe {{Little One}}, it's your time to shine! We'll be rooting for you back here!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawwr!

;(If the player leaves the quest area as Little One)
:{{Black Screen|You call {{Little One}} back...}}
:;(Restart section)

;(Approach "Kururuk" the first time)
:'''Paimon:''' Aww, that's too bad... But no worries, there's still hope!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Approach "Kururuk" the second time)
:'''Paimon:''' Gaaah, it ran away again!? Flying is cheating, you know! The only way we'll catch it is if it crashes into something!
:'''Paimon:''' No... No way...
;("Kururuk" crashes into the cliffside)
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;What!? Th&mdash;This isn't Paimon's fault, you can't blame me... Wait, that's not important!  We gotta hurry and save it, {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Approach "Kururuk" the third time)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr?
:'''Paimon:''' Under the stone! It's buried underneath it!

;(After breaking the rocks trapping "Kururuk")
:'''"Kururuk":''' Shrawr...
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon's kinda worried about how Kururuk's wounds haven't fully healed yet... Why don't we follow him and see how things are?
:{{Black Screen|You hurry over to {{Little One}} and Kururuk.}}
:'''Paimon:''' There he is? Phew, at least he looks fine... Alright, let's feed him the medicine now!
:'''Paimon:''' Which of the two should we go with?
;(Open Item Submission screen)

;(If player submits {{Item|Medicine of Superior Taste}})
:'''Paimon:''' Well, even if this one doesn't work as well, just having him eat the medicine at all is progress enough! Let's do this, {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, he snapped it right up? Hmm... But he still looks pretty listless.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wroo?
:'''Paimon:''' Sh&mdash;Should we try the other one, then?
:{{DIcon}} Might as well.
::'''Paimon:''' We're counting on you for Round Two, {{Little One}}!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Chowed it right down! But...
::'''Paimon:''' Uh oh! He's even madder than before! Quick, we gotta calm him down!
:{{DIcon}} Let's not go with either for now.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, that does make sense... Actually, why don't we bring him back to Mazkal now that he's being a bit less rowdy?
:;(Proceed to "Talk to Mazkal")

;(If player submits {{Item|Medicine of Greater Efficacy}})
:'''Paimon:''' If he'll eat it, this one should help him recover better, right? You've got this now, {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks pretty hopeful. Hehe, good work, {{Little One}}! ...Err, wait a minute...
:'''"Kururuk":''' &mdash;Shwaaaargh!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh!? W&mdash;Was the medicine too effective? He looks even angrier than before! Gah, we've gotta calm him down real quick...

;(While fighting "Kururuk")
:'''Paimon:''' Be careful, {{Traveler}}! Don't hurt it!

;(After defeating "Kururuk")
:'''"Kururuk":''' Rrooah...
:{{DIcon}} Is this really a Saurian who still hasn't fully recovered?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrooo... Rawr! Rawr! Raaawr!
:'''Paimon:''' He'd probably be a super tough opponent when he's in tip-top shape... Anyway, let's bring him back to Mazkal while he's being a bit more docile!

;(Talk to Mazkal)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Raaaawr!
:'''Mazkal:''' You're back! How did it go? Did Kururuk take his medicine?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, he did, but...
:{{Black Screen|You explain what happened earlier...}}
:'''Mazkal:''' I see. Alright, let me have a look... Hmm. Looks like he's fine, not hurt too badly at all.
:'''Mazkal:''' Either way, it's a good thing that he took the medicine! And now that I know how he reacts, I can adjust the formula accordingly.
:'''Mazkal:''' Yup, don't worry, we should be fine. Thanks for your help &mdash; especially you, {{Little One}}! What an amazing little [[Tepetlisaur]] you are!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawwr!
:'''Paimon:''' Haha, it's nice hearing people praise {{Little One}} &mdash; even better than hearing them praise Paimon, in fact!
:'''Mazkal:''' I'm impressed at how well you two get along with this little guy too. I could stand to learn a thing or two from you.
:{{DIcon}} Truly amazing, am I not?
:{{DIcon}} Not at all, the credit belongs to {{Little One}}.
:'''Mazkal:''' I'd love to say that there's something I could do to help you, or do for you...
:'''Mazkal:''' But I think I'll settle for wishing you the best of health. Best you never need my help!
:'''Mazkal:''' Ah, right, but if you just want to chat, you're welcome to come find me anytime.
:'''Paimon:''' Sure! Hope Kururuk recovers soon &mdash; hopefully without instantly resorting to hitting people, like he did earlier...
:'''Mazkal:''' As for that... Not to worry, I'll figure something out. And you never know, his temper might improve along with his wounds!
;(Quest completes)

;(Talk to Mazkal, optional)
:'''Mazkal:''' I think Kururuk's almost recovered from his injuries... Maybe an increase in the intensity of his rehab exercises is in order.

;(Talk to "Kururuk", optional)
:'''"Kururuk":''' ...

;(Talk to "Kururuk" while indwelling a saurian, optional)
:'''"Kururuk":''' ...
