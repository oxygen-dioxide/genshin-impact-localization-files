'''Concocting Potions''' is a subevent during [[Alchemical Ascension]].

It can be accessed from the station with the {{Icon|Concocting Potions}} icon.

==Tutorial==
;Concocting Potions
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Concocting Potions 1.png
|text1  = Place ingredients and cover more area to increase the {{Color|BP|Tuning Rate}} for this concoction. When the Tuning Rate reaches {{Color|BP|100% or higher}}, you can concoct the potion and receive the finished product.
}}

;Potion Efficacy, Grade, and Level
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Concocting Potions Potion Efficacy, Grade, and Level 1.png
|text1  = When placing ingredients, you can cause the potion to gain {{Color|BP|efficacy}} values of five different types, including Constitution and so on. When you finish concocting a potion, the efficacy value that is {{Color|BP|highest}} will determine the potion's {{Color|BP|type}} and {{Color|BP|grade}}. There are four different potion grades: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Special, and this is the primary determinant of the {{Color|BP|sale price}}.
|image2 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Concocting Potions Potion Efficacy, Grade, and Level 2.png
|text2  = The efficacy value {{Color|BP|that was not sufficient to reach the next potion grade}} will be converted to a {{Color|BP|potion level}} of +0 to +10, {{Color|BP|increasing the sale price}} of the potion. Increasing the Tuning Rate to over 100%, using a beautiful bottle, or receiving a Lucky Bonus can all increase the potion level.
}}

;Potion Characteristics
{{Tutorial
|image1   = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Potion Characteristics.png
|text1    = Different ingredients also have 10 different {{Color|BP|characteristics}}, including Warm, Endurance, and so on. If 2 or more of the corresponding ingredients are added, the potion may also gain this characteristic. Initially, potions can have up to 2 characteristics.
}}

;Concoction Opportunities
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Concocting Potions Concoction Opportunities 1.png
|text1  = You will initially have 1 chance to concoct a potion each operation cycle. By using more ingredients when concocting a potion, you can gain more {{Color|BP|Alchemy Level Experience}} and {{Color|BP|Potion Ingredient Experience}}, and there is a chance to create an even stronger potion. Make good use of your opportunities to concoct potions!
}}

;Combination Potions
{{Tutorial
|image1   = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Combination Potions.png
|text1    = If the two highest efficacy values are {{Color|BP|of the same grade}} and reach a certain standard, a Combination Potion will be produced. A Combination Potion will have {{Color|BP|two types of efficacy}}, and though the sale price will not increase, it can more easily satisfy different market demands, increasing sales volume.
}}

;Stacking Ingredients
{{Tutorial
|image1   = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Stacking Ingredients.png
|text1    = Once you have mastered the advanced technique of stacking ingredients, each time you concoct a potion, there will be squares on which ingredients may be stacked within the cauldron.<br>As your Alchemy Level increases, the number of stackable squares will increase.
}}

;Enhancing Potions
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Enhancing Potions 1.png
|text1  = When certain conditions have been met, you can spend funds to improve your final potion products. {{Color|BP|Enhanced Potions can be sold for a higher price}}, and the potion's efficacy or special characteristics will not change.
}}

;Alchemy Exams
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Alchemy Exams 1.png
|text1  = Alchemy Exams are tests intended to assess your potioneering techniques. The exam is split into several stages that must be completed in sequence. You have 3 attempts for each stage. Additionally, {{Color|BP|potions produced during the exams will not be saved. You will instead be refunded the ingredients consumed during the exam}}.
|image2 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Alchemy Exams 2.png
|text2  = Each test stage comes with its primary and secondary objective(s). {{Color|BP|Complete the primary objective to pass the test}}, and complete the secondary objective(s) to increase your test rating. Test rewards are based on your rating.<br>If you fail the exam, you must wait a certain period before retaking the exam.
}}

;Quick Concoctions
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Alchemical Ascension Quick Concoctions.png
|text1  = Save formulae to perform Quick Concoctions.<br>When you perform Quick Concoctions, {{Color|BP|your saved formula}} will be automatically placed into the cauldron, though ingredients you do not have enough of in storage will not be automatically added.
}}
