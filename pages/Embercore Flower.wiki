==Descriptions==
{{Description|A strange flower that can be found all over the plains and highlands. Mature buds will bloom after being hit.<br>Places where Embercore Flowers grow in abundance are referred to by Natlan locals as "ground once trodden on by the mighty Xbalanque."<br>The nectar that these flowers contain within their cores is so sweet that it leaves a burning sensation on the tongues and lips of those who taste it. Extremely popular among Natlan tribesfolk, their unrelenting glow prior to withering is viewed as a symbol of passion and zeal. Though none recall when the custom began, before entering the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, tribal warriors have offered up the cores of these flowers in temples as part of their bid for victory and glory.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Embercore Flowers seem to require Phlogiston to grow.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Waiting For Seeds to Sprout}}</ref>
* Embercore Flowers in particularly Phlogiston-rich areas may bloom even without being hit.
* Embercore Flowers may have healing properties for [[Saurian]]s.
** [[Little One]] directs the player to give Embercore Flowers to a gravely wounded [[Qucusaur]], which quickly heals it enough to fly away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Weighty Wings}}</ref>
