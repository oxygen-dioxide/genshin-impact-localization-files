{{Quest Description|You know that it might not be fruitful even if you pursue it to the end, so you decide to forget about the Wisdom Seelie's prank and watch over Layla as she rests.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Let's stop here... I don't think I can walk any further...
:{{DIcon}} I'll prepare some food and juice.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Alright, I'm gonna give my legs a rest. I'll be waiting for you here.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I feel bad for making you go through so much trouble for me. If only I were more capable...
:{{DIcon}} No, you shouldn't say that.
:{{DIcon}} We're all skilled at different things.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I'm sorry... *sigh* I always find myself having to apologize.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 05.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But enough of that, I need to pull myself together. The memories I've been reminded of are all really taxing.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 06.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I cannot just give up this time, even if my head's not in a good place. Letting these heavy feelings get the best of me will only slow us down.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Ahh, watch out! Behind you!
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 08.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Monsters! A lot of them, too... Why didn't we see them coming?
:{{DIcon}} Just leave it to me, it'll only take a moment.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 09.ogg}} '''Layla:''' No, I'll fight, too.
:{{DIcon}} You need to rest.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 10.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But I want to help, I can't just sit back and watch you while you fight. Don't worry, I can handle myself.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 11.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I mustn't keep repeating my past regrets. That's the most valuable lesson I've learned today.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 12.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I should take action when I'm needed and give it my all when the moment calls.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 13.ogg}} '''Layla:''' If you miss those opportunities in life, you may never get another chance to make up for them. I suppose that's fate.
:{{DIcon}} I see.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915602 layla 14.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Alright, let's take them all down.

;(Defeat the attacking monsters)

;(Talk to Layla)
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' *panting* ...I really need to keep up with my training.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' It's embarrassing to be out of breath so quickly like this...
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
:{{DIcon}} You look pale.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Well, the only appropriate response would be to say that I'm fine, right? I'm pale due to lack of sleep, not because of the fight...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But then again, I know you'd be able to see right through those words... I'm feeling weak, there's no hiding it.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 05.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I'm just happy I didn't get in your way during the fight...
:{{DIcon}} You did great.
;(Stress Value &minus;1)
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 06.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Oh, hehe... thanks for the compliment. I sure don't get to hear that often.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Although I may not be physically strong, my will is as resilient as they come. I'll be fine after I rest for a bit.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915606 layla 08.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Can you stay with me while I recover my energy? It shouldn't take long.
