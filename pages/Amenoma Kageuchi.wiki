==Gameplay Notes==
* Succession Seeds are visualized as small purple orbs floating above the hilt of the sword.
* The duration of the Succession Seeds is shared, and obtaining a new succession seed restarts the 30s timer.
* The Succession Seeds do not disappear on changing characters, so it is not needed to keep the character on field all the time to obtain the maximum effect from this passive.
* You '''do not''' have to hit an enemy with the Elemental Skill to gain Succession Seeds.

==Description==
One of the "kageuchi" copies of the famed sword "[[Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma]]."<br>
It was gifted to the [[Saimon Clan]] by [[Douin]], the founding patriarch of the [[Iwakura Clan]].<br>
This gift was given in thanks for the care that he received from them when he was living in seclusion in [[Konda Village]].

It is said that Iwakura's secret blade technique, Tengu Sweeper, can only be performed when there is not a single trace of confusion in one's heart.<br>
In the past, the name "Tengu Sweeper" sounded the same as "Tengu Victor," and it was a sword strike that could cut a [[Tengu]] soaring in the sky down.<br>
For centuries, the swordsmen of Iwakura, they who inherited the name "In," would use this secret blade to destroy countless evils throughout the Inazuman archipelago.

Legend has it that the Tengu Sweeper was first created in the courtyard of a small shrine where incense no longer burned.<br>
The technique was so powerful that it destroyed the building, and Iwakura Douin's sword was broken in two.<br>
After that, he founded the Iwakura Art with his swordsmanship skills and became the instructor of the [[Kujou Clan]].<br>
He would also have the [[Amenoma Smithy|Amenoma]] master of that time craft the sword that would be passed down through the "In" line &mdash; the "Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma."

Legends abound concerning the deeds done using that blade. It is said that its edge was so sharp that it might even cut through mortal fate.<br>
As for the overly lengthy name, it is said that Iwakura Douin specified to Amenoma that it be called as such.

** Its [[Diagram]], the [[Saimon Heirloom Blade Diagram]], is obtained from completing [[The Farmer's Treasure]].

==Trivia==
* [[Kamisato Ayaka]] is seen wielding this sword in some official media, such as her [https://youtu.be/5RCsr1Y8UZA official Character Demo] and her [https://youtu.be/hUDhKYxGh0M Collected Miscellany].
* In Japanese swordsmithing, a sword is called by the name of its swordsmith. The term ''Amenoma'' therefore refers to both the swordsmith [[Amenoma Smithy|Amenoma]] and this sword itself.
* The English and Chinese texts of the lore say that the [[Iwakura Clan|Iwakura]]'s sword art Tengu Sweeper sounded the same as the Tengu Victor in the past. In the Japanese version, however, they still sound exactly the same: {{ja|天狗抄|tl=Tengu Raid}} and {{ja|天狗勝|tl=Tengu Victor}} are both pronounced "''Tengu-Shou''." As a result, the Japanese text revises the sentence slightly to say that "Tengu Raid ({{ja|天狗抄}}) is a pun on Tengu Victor ({{ja|天狗勝}})."

===Etymology===
{{See Also|Amenoma Smithy#Etymology|Iwakura Michihiro#Etymology}}
* In Japanese swordsmithing, {{Lang|''kageuchi''|ja=影打|ja_tl=shadow forging}} refers to a type of a spare product.<ref name="markus-sesko">Google Books: [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=kFTNe-WjyBcC&pg=PA122#v=onepage Legends and Stories around the Japanese Sword](pg. 122)</ref> In some cases, a swordsmith forges two swords for one order to pursue perfection.<ref name="markus-sesko" /> After giving the finishing touches, the smith signs their name on the one which they think is better and delivers the work to the customer.<ref name="markus-sesko" /> The inferior one, or the ''kageuchi'', is left unsigned and usually kept by the swordsmith themself.<ref name="markus-sesko" />
* The name of the original of this sword, {{Lang|Hakuen Michimitsu|ja=薄縁満光}}, can mean "Ephemeral Fate, Full Light." The legend that it may even slash "mortal fate" ({{ja|人の縁}}) likely refers to the Buddhist philosophy that disregarding and breaking bonds with the Twelve Fates or "{{w|Pratītyasamutpāda|Links}}" ({{ja|縁起}}), which are considered to be the twelve major laws of the world's system (and thus the origins of suffering), is said to lead the person to full enlightenment.
** The name shares the theme with [[Ei]]'s signature sword art [[Musou no Hitotachi]], meaning the Slash of No Conception (Non-Thought). Such analogies between swordsmanship and Buddhism have also been historically common and were mainly developed by the swordsman-philosophers {{w|Yagyū Munenori|Yagyuu Munenori}} and {{w|Miyamoto Musashi}}.
