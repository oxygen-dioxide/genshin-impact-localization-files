==Profile==
Anna's family owns Kiminami Restaurant, a well-known restaurant in the [[Hanamizaka]] area of [[Inazuma City]]. At some point prior to the [[Traveler]]'s arrival, her father mysteriously disappeared, and with the restaurant low on staff, she took up the position as owner and cook. Her restaurant is frequented by [[Kamisato Ayaka]] on a frequent basis.

After leaving [[Ritou]] with [[Hiiragi Chisato]]'s assistance, they went to deliver her letter to [[Kujou Kamaji]], who told them to meet him at Kiminami Restaurant. He had ordered a box of [[Tricolor Dango]] from Anna and gave it to the Traveler, who brought the letter and treats to Chisato.

During Ayaka's [[Story Quest]], Anna meets the Traveler and explains that she wanted something new and foreign to bring customers in. After [[Paimon]] suggests [[Mushroom Pizza]], the Traveler has the option of creating the original or a [[Special Mushroom Pizza|local variant]] and brings it to Anna, who enjoys the taste and concept, taking it in and promoting it. While mostly positive, customers either sought a more local or original variety (depending on the Traveler's suggestion), which she is able to make with the Traveler's assistance and began to sell both of them.

When the Traveler returned from [[Seirai Island]] and found a [[Neko|talking cat]] who wanted food, [[Eiko]] suggested they ask Anna for a dish. Anna was surprised to learn of a talking cat and wished to head to the shrine in the near future. She used [[Raw Meat]], [[Fish]], [[Seagrass]] and [[Rice]] to create a [[Kiminami Anna's Invigorating Kitty Meal|special meal]], while providing the Traveler with the [[Invigorating Kitty Meal|recipe]] for their own use.

===Personality===
Anna enjoys cooking and wishes to promote the family restaurant for success, experimenting with various foods and taking feedback to modify them as necessary.

===Appearance===
''(To be added.)''

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Prior to completing [[Food From Afar]])
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hello! Welcome to Kiminami Restaurant, the first and last stop for gourmet culture in Inazuma.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Can I get some food to go?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Take your pick &mdash; I'm very proud of each and every one of these.
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' This is Kiminami Restaurant. I, the future owner Kiminami Anna, run the place right now. Our restaurant has inherited the cooking skills of the royal head chef of the Shogunate. You could even say that we are the face of fine Inazuman cuisine.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' But let me just preface everything by saying that we've been short-staffed ever since my father disappeared, so you'll have to wait for a while if you wish to dine-in. We have lemon water with unlimited refills available in the meantime.
::{{DIcon}} About your father...
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I suppose I should start from the beginning here... A long time ago, my father came to Inazuma as a foreign gourmet foodie. He was very impressed by the local culinary scene, so he volunteered to be a kitchen assistant at this restaurant.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Later on, my father married into the Kiminami Clan. After my grandfather had been called by the Shogunate to become the head chef, he and my mom started to run Kiminami Restaurant together.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I've been learning how to cook since I was little. I was supposed to take over Kiminami Restaurant when they retired. But my father suddenly disappeared last year without leaving a trace.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' That's how I started cooking in the restaurant to help my mom.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hmm... Although I've learned a lot, I'm still far from being on grandpa's level. I have to become better still if I want to take over this restaurant.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' If you have any feedback for me after trying out the food here, please don't hesitate to let me know.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Come back next time! I'll be even better then.

;(After completing [[Food From Afar]])
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hello, you must be Miss Kamisato's friend! Come in! Would you like to try the new dish that I just learned?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Can I get some food to go?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I have already learned the recipe you gave me previously, and I've added it to the menu. Otherwise, take your pick.
:{{DIcon}} How have things been lately?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I have learned some new recipes since we last met. The new products I made have even been approved by my mom.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Once my cooking skills are as good as my grandpa's were back when he was working as the royal head chef of the Shogunate, I will probably be able to take over this restaurant.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' My father will be stunned when he gets back, oh yes he will, indeed!
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Oh right, you can also invite Miss Kamisato here too. If it's you asking, I think she will definitely agree to come, hehe.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} May your culinary arts become more and more refined.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hee-hee, thanks~
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' That reminds me, I got some fresh fish today. Please try the fresh tuna sushi! I made it myself.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' If you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me. After all, suggestions go hand in hand with improvement.
:;(Obtain [[Tuna Sushi]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Goodbye! Come back soon.
