==Profile==
Anna's family owns Kiminami Restaurant, a well-known restaurant in the Hanamizaka area of [[Inazuma City]]. At some point prior to the [[Traveler]]'s arrival, her father mysteriously disappeared, and with the restaurant low on staff, she took up the position as owner and cook. The restaurant is frequented by [[Kamisato Ayato]] and [[Kamisato Ayaka]].<ref name="FFA">{{Ref/Quest|Food From Afar}}</ref>

===Appearance===
She has brown hair, brown eyes, and dons a red and gray dress.

==Story==
After delivering [[Hiiragi Chisato]]'s letter to [[Kujou Kamaji]], the Traveler and [[Paimon]] meet up with him at Kiminami Restaurant, where he orders a box of [[Tricolor Dango]] from Anna for the Traveler to bring back to Chisato along with his own letter. Kamaji deflects Anna's curiosity about his order by claiming that it is a reciprocal gift towards Chisato's father, [[Hiiragi Shinsuke]], with Chisato as the recipient due to Shinsuke's doting on his daughter.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Chisato's Letter}}</ref>

During {{Quest|The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit}}, Ayaka brings the Traveler to Kiminami Restaurant. After Ayaka hastily departs from the table to deal with a certain matter, Anna explains Ayaka's history with the restaurant when they are interrupted when Ayaka's attempt to make an overseas dish ends in disaster. After learning that she wanted to bring an easily transportable dish as a gift to Tsubaki, Paimon proposes that they make pizza. Ayaka brings the pizza to Anna for packaging, which piques the restauranteur's interest. Paimon offers to teach Anna how to make it, and the Traveler writes down a recipe &mdash; either creating a standard Mondstadt [[Mushroom Pizza]] or a [[Special Mushroom Pizza]] using Inazuman ingredients &mdash; which Anna then adds to the restaurant's menu.<ref name="FFA" /> In the follow-up {{Quest|Pizza From Another Land}}, the version the Traveler did not initially make is developed and added to the menu after Anna received feedback from one of either [[Rie]] or [[Matsumoto]].

Among [[Neko]]'s various tasks for reviving [[Seirai Island]]'s [[Asase Shrine]] includes recreating a dish involving [[Fish]], [[Raw Meat]], [[Seagrass]], and [[Rice]], which was once made for the cats on the island by its last shrine maiden, [[Asase Hibiki]]. At [[Etsuko]]'s suggestion, Paimon and the Traveler pay Anna a visit. After hearing about the background behind their request, Anna resolves to create a dish palatable to cats and develops [[Kiminami Anna's Invigorating Kitty Meal]], and gives the Traveler her [[Invigorating Kitty Meal|recipe]] for their own use.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Neko Is a Cat: Shrine Recipe}}</ref>

During {{Quest|Bottleneck Breaking}}, [[Sayu]] and the Traveler skip out on ninjutsu training for a nutritious meal in hopes of instigating a height spurt in Sayu. After Sayu gorges herself, the player's response determines whether Sayu decides to keep going or consider other options. If she chooses to go to [[Shimura's]] next, Anna expresses her concern over Sayu; if they decide to head to the [[Adventurers' Guild]] to look for a commission, Anna interrupts them to tell them about [[Treasure Hoarders]] who have been targeting her restaurant staff when they go to collect ingredients in the wild.

==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
Available before completing ''Food From Afar''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hello! Welcome to Kiminami Restaurant, the first and last stop for gourmet culture in Inazuma.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Can I get some food to go?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Take your pick &mdash; I'm very proud of each and every one of these.
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' This is Kiminami Restaurant. I, the future owner Kiminami Anna, run the place right now. Our restaurant has inherited the cooking skills of the royal head chef of the Shogunate. You could even say that we are the face of fine Inazuman cuisine.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' But let me just preface everything by saying that we've been short-staffed ever since my father disappeared, so you'll have to wait for a while if you wish to dine-in. We have lemon water with unlimited refills available in the meantime.
::{{DIcon}} About your father...
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I suppose I should start from the beginning here... A long time ago, my father came to Inazuma as a foreign gourmet foodie. He was very impressed by the local culinary scene, so he volunteered to be a kitchen assistant at this restaurant.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Later on, my father married into the Kiminami Clan. After my grandfather had been called by the Shogunate to become the head chef, he and my mom started to run Kiminami Restaurant together.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I've been learning how to cook since I was little. I was supposed to take over Kiminami Restaurant when they retired. But my father suddenly disappeared last year without leaving a trace.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' That's how I started cooking in the restaurant to help my mom.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hmm... Although I've learned a lot, I'm still far from being on grandpa's level. I have to become better still if I want to take over this restaurant.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' If you have any feedback for me after trying out the food here, please don't hesitate to let me know.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Come back next time! I'll be even better then.

===Dialogue Set #2===
Available after completing ''Food From Afar''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hello, you must be Miss Kamisato's friend! Come in! Would you like to try the new dish that I just learned?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Can I get some food to go?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I have already learned the recipe you gave me previously, and I've added it to the menu. Otherwise, take your pick.
:{{DIcon}} How have things been lately?
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' I have learned some new recipes since we last met. The new products I made have even been approved by my mom.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Once my cooking skills are as good as my grandpa's were back when he was working as the royal head chef of the Shogunate, I will probably be able to take over this restaurant.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' My father will be stunned when he gets back, oh yes he will, indeed!
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Oh right, you can also invite Miss Kamisato here too. If it's you asking, I think she will definitely agree to come, hehe.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} May your culinary arts become more and more refined.
:::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Hee-hee, thanks~
:::'''Kiminami Anna:''' That reminds me, I got some fresh fish today. Please try the fresh tuna sushi! I made it myself.
:::'''Kiminami Anna:''' If you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me. After all, suggestions go hand in hand with improvement.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Tuna Sushi|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kiminami Anna:''' Goodbye! Come back soon.
