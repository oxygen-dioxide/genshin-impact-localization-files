==Personality==
{{Quote|The tycoon of a winery empire in [[Mondstadt]], unmatched in every possible way.|In-game character attributes and profile page text.}}
[[Kaeya]] calls himself and Diluc "anti-heroes with attitude problems". He decided to take matters into his own hands by becoming, to his dismay and embarrassment, the "[[Darknight Hero]]" to protect Mondstadt's people.

Diluc was once an ideal young man, dedicated to his work with Knights of Favonius. After his father's untimely demise as a result of using a [[Delusion]], along with Inspector [[Eroch]] ordering Diluc to cover up the incident, his faith in the Knights shattered and he left the organization. Even after Eroch was purged from the Knights for being a traitor, he still holds resentment towards them. He claims that the Knights take too long to get the job done, although he still appreciates those who put the effort in, such as [[Lisa]] and [[Jean]].

When he was a member of the Knights, he adored his father, [[Crepus]]. Being praised by his father made him happier than fame and anything else, and Crepus told Diluc to be faithful in his duties. After his father's death, he has been suppressing himself. Despite coming off as bitter and grumpy through his speech, he has a gentle, tender, and modest nature. In his childhood, Diluc had a lighthearted and happy nature, rather to the contrary of him now.

Diluc is not fond of alcohol, as he does not like its taste and that it clouds his mind when he tries to work. He prefers non-alcoholic drinks such as grape juice and apple cider, which he had ordered developed upon his return to Mondstadt. This does not appear to be well known by many however, most likely as a result of him being the current owner of Mondstadt's largest wine producer. He even expresses surprise when he learns that [[Diona]] also loathes alcohol, having initially believed that he was the only bartender in Mondstadt that did not like alcohol.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Diluc|About Diona}}</ref> He also tends to part with his possessions he no longer needs, such as his father's private residence.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Diluc is a tall and slender man with pale skin, red eyes, and bright red hair, worn in a low ponytail that extends to his mid-back. His expression usually makes him appear stern, exasperated, or unimpressed.

Diluc wears a black dress shirt, a long white vest, and a black ascot with a red gem. Over this he dons a dark brown coat. He wears black pants which are embellished with chains on his right thigh, while his Vision is attached to a belt. Diluc also wears cuffed, dark brown boots and a pair of black gloves which he has a habit of adjusting.

His default outfit, [[Darknight Blaze]], is described to be a smart and tasteful suit fit for a nobleman.

His alternative outfit, [[Red Dead of Night]], is described as to be used for covert operations and to "greet" unwanted guests coming to Mondstadt.

▌Master of the Dawn Winery · Diluc<br />
I will keep marching on until dawn.

<nowiki>========================================</nowiki>

People in Mondstadt like to have a glass of dandelion wine after a long day. As your vision begins to waver and mind starts to wander, refraining from pouring another one seems impossible.

The constant flow of brews keeps Diluc, operator of Mondstadt's biggest supplier, "Dawn Winery", firmly in the position of the richest man in Mondstadt.

But what no-one can make sense of is, despite building his enterprise on wine, Diluc has never touched a single drop, no matter the occasion.

When asked by outsiders as to why, his response is always the same — a polite yet mysterious and faint smile that always brings about a multitude of guesses.

But this question is never asked by anyone at the winery, for they have all long since known the answer — Diluc simply doesn't like wine.

===Manga===
Diluc is a major character in the [[manga]], which takes place shortly after his return to Mondstadt three years after his father's death.<ref group="Note">This conflicts with Diluc's [[#Character_Story_5|Character Story 5]], which says that by the time Diluc returned to Mondstadt, four years had already passed. There is a number of other discrepancies between details in the manga and information presented in-game. Given the manga's age, details in the manga that conflict with in-game information may no longer be accurate.</ref>

In his early days of being a vigilante, Diluc fought using throwing knives and the [[Delusion]] his father once owned. He also wore a bird mask and a black cloak to hide his identity.

Along with various members of the Knights of Favonius, although he works independently of the organization, Diluc rebuffs [[Krupp]]'s recruitment attempt for the Fatui and later foils the Fatui's plan to attract something dangerous using metal birds during [[Ludi Harpastum]]. He eventually uses the Delusion to pose as the perpetrator of the Black Fire Incident due to the similarities between its powers and those of [[Collei]], the true culprit. Afterward, he abandons the disguise and Delusion, mailing them both broken to [[Il Dottore]]. Kaeya returns his Vision under the guise of gifting him [[Strange Vase|a vase]].

==Notes==
{{Reflist|note=1}}

==Trivia==
* When Diluc's Elemental Burst is ready, the red gem on his tie and the four buttons with red crosses on the back of his coat will glow along with his Vision.
* [[Kaeya]] was adopted into the [[Ragnvindr]] family. In the original Chinese version, Kaeya used to call Diluc {{Lang|"sworn elder brother"|zh=义兄|zh_rm=yì xiōng}},<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaeya|Character Details}}</ref> which was simply translated as "brother" in the English version.
** "Sworn brothers," in the simplest terms, means "brothers who are not related by blood." It also refers to a delicate bond formed between to close friends built from trust and honor.
** In Kaeya's [[Kaeya/Lore#Vision|Vision Character Story]], Kaeya is referred to as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=义子|zh_rm=yìzǐ|zh_tl=foster son}}, Crepus is referred to as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=养父|zh_rm=yǎngfù|zh_tl=adoptive father}}, and Kaeya is called {{Lang|mini=1|zh=养子|zh_rm=yǎngzǐ|zh_tl=adopted son}}.
* The vase Kaeya gifts him in the manga can be found in-game, inside the Dawn Winery. Its description notes it looks out-of-place and is probably a gift. This is the same vase he mentions during ''[[A Child's Secret]]''.
* In [[Flame Born]], the second chapter of the manga, a close look at a picture frame on the shelf in Diluc's manor reveals that it depicts HOMU, a mascot from ''Honkai Impact 3rd''. Next to the picture frame is a book with an eight-pointed star on its back cover; this symbol is typically seen on the clothing of characters from [[Khaenri'ah]] and the [[Abyss Order]].
* Despite owning a winery, Diluc dislikes the mouthfeel of alcohol and prefers grape juice, which he keeps stocked at Angel's Share.
** According to [[Vile]], Diluc once downed an entire glass of Snezhnaya's specialty alcohol, Fire-Water, in one go during a banquet with Snezhnayan merchants. Afterwards, he passed out for three days, and Adelinde remarked that she'd "never seen someone get drunk like that before." [[Charles]]' dialogue about Fire-Water may be referencing this incident.
* Diluc has a habit of pulling his left glove up &mdash; he does so in his character card, in an idle animation, and before attacking enemies during certain cutscenes. This may be related to the fact that Diluc previously wore his Delusion on his left glove.
* Based on his character stories, Diluc's estimated age is roughly 22 years old. Diluc left Mondstadt after his father's death on his 18th birthday, and by the time he returned 4 years later, Varka &mdash; who embarked on his expedition 6 months before the game's story &mdash; was already gone.
** The manga's timeline conflicts with Diluc's character stories. The manga is set merely 3 years after Crepus' death, making its events occur before Diluc returned to Mondstadt.
* In Diluc's official wish art, he is seen wielding the [[Bloodtainted Greatsword]], a gacha weapon.
* Diluc has an anonymous message on the [[Cat's Tail Message Board#Bennett's Message|Cat's Tail Message Board]], in which he lets himself express wistfulness for the past before wishing Cat's Tail luck in their business.
* Diluc owns an [[Umbertail Falcon]] and used to own a pet tortoise.
* Diluc is one of only two residents of Mondstadt who are aware that [[Venti]] is [[Barbatos]], the other being [[Jean]]. While Venti also revealed himself to [[Stanley]], the latter does not remember their conversation.
* Diluc is known by these aliases or titles:
** Darknight Hero<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|5}}</ref><ref name="alibi">{{Ref/Quest|Darknight Hero's Alibi}}</ref>
** The Uncrowned King of Mondstadt<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|Character Details}}</ref>
** Cavalry Captain (Former)<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|2}}</ref>
** Captain Pyro (by [[Paimon]])<ref name="alibi" />
** The Weird Grown-up (by [[Klee]])<ref>{{Ref/VO|Klee|About Diluc}}</ref>
** Master Diluc

===Etymology===
* Diluc's name is derived from the Latin word [[wiktionary:diluculum|dīlūculum]], meaning "daybreak" or "dawn."
** His father, Crepus, has his named derived from its antonym, [[wiktionary:crepusculum|crepusculum]], meaning "twilight," "dusk," or "darkness."
* His constellation, Noctua, is Latin for "The Owl," or literally, "Night Bird."<ref>Wiktionary: [[wiktionary:noctua|noctua]]</ref>
* His family name, Ragnvindr, may be derived from the Old Norse words {{wt|regin||Old Norse}} (gods) + {{wt|vindr||Old Norse}} (wind), meaning "Wind God."
