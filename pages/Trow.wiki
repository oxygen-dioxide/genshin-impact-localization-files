{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Trow:''' Hello there. There are no ongoing performances or trials at present, so there's no need to stay here for too long.
:{{DIcon}} Won't you be lonely here all by yourself?
::'''Trow:''' Hmm? Not at all.
::'''Trow:''' Sometimes, many people come here, and the place is incredibly crowded. At other times, it is just like it is now, empty as can be.
::'''Trow:''' Reminds you of the tides lapping against the shore, doesn't it?
::'''Trow:''' And with these tides for company, I'm not lonesome at all.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} That's really amazing of Melusine.
:::'''Trow:''' Thank you for the compliment, but you didn't just say that for me to let my guard down, did you?
:::'''Trow:''' Hmm... Judging from your attitude, you're not teasing me.
:::'''Trow:''' Then I'll let you in on a little secret. I actually prefer when there is no tide.
:::'''Trow:''' I used to live by the sea. Back then, I always dove into the sea to collect Romaritime Flowers when the tide was calm.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Romaritime Flower|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} I see.
::'''Trow:''' Sure. The exit's over there, by the way.
