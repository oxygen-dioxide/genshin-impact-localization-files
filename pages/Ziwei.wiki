==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Ziwei is an astrologist who is mostly interested in coming up with new names for the constellations she finds. She is an ardent reader of [[The Steambird]]'s astrology column, and finds [[Mona]]'s articles interesting but rather dense and technical for her.<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/16276 The shining stars above have long decided the fate of all.]</ref>

===Appearance===
Ziwei is a woman with short, black hair and straight bangs. She has brown eyes and wears round glasses without temples. Her clothes consist of a long-sleeved Cheongsam, a one-piece garment with a high collar, buttons on the shoulder and slits on the side. The garment is dark blue and has a flower and leaves motive on her left shoulder. Ziwei also wears a white inner skirt, a piece that has long, black and tight sleeves underneath and a thin black belt with a jade tassel on it as well.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ziwei:''' Hello traveler.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Ziwei:''' As you can see, I'm making some astronomical observations. I discovered a few new asterisms recently. Would you care to hear about them?
::{{DIcon}} Asterism... like a constellation?
:::'''Ziwei:''' Yes, essentially. Asterisms are the patterns formed by groups of stars in the night sky. Sometimes they even make recognizable shapes. There's nothing that gets me more excited than that.
:::'''Ziwei:''' I note down and collect asterisms like some people collect shells on a beach. Whenever I find a new one, I always like to give it a special and unique name.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds fascinating...
:::'''Ziwei:''' It is! Look, this one is called "Fungora Boreas"... Get it? Because it looks like a boar digging for mushrooms.
:::'''Ziwei:''' And this one is "Geo Lord Versus Bovine Beast." Look, look, here's the cow's head... and here's his horns...
:::{{DIcon}} ...Nope, I don't see it.
::::'''Ziwei:''' Look harder... And this one! So this one is "Frosted Jade Crystal Vase with Mother-of-Pearl Inlay, Inlaid with Pearls"... Isn't it the spitting image!?
:::{{DIcon}} I don't quite get it...
::::'''Ziwei:''' That's normal if you're not versed in astronomy. To be fair, it does require a certain grasp of the basics to appreciate the secrets of the stars and their patterns.
:::'''Ziwei:''' If you're really interested, I'd recommend that you read the column about constellations in [[The Steambird]].
:::'''Ziwei:''' Ever since Astrologist [[Mona]] Megistus took over that column, she'll often write some very interesting things.
:::'''Ziwei:''' Even though I don't entirely get it myself, it is rather fascinating! I will definitely continue supporting her!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Isn't it inconvenient to get around at night?
:::'''Ziwei:''' That is the case somewhat.
:::'''Ziwei:''' But the stars will only appear in the night sky, so it can't be helped. I have also developed a countermeasure.
:::'''Ziwei:''' This is known as a [[Small Lamp Grass]], which glows in the dark. It's not bright, but it gives you a sense of security.
:::'''Ziwei:''' If you often travel in the dark yourself, consider bringing a few of these along.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Small Lamp Grass|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Ah... Bye.
::'''Ziwei:''' Bye-bye!
