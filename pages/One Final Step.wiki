===One Final Step===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Look for the clues the Wisdom Seelie left behind)
;(Near the rock formation)
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' We're probably getting close now. Let's search this area.

;(Upon destroying the rock formation)
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Here it is, just as I thought. The Seelie must have placed it here in advance.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Let's see what we have this time... Whatever it is, I'm ready.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Huh? It's a... picture?
:{{DIcon}} So it's not a riddle this time?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 05.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Guess not. This house looks like it's in Vimara Village. Does the Seelie want us to go there?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe some sort of trap is waiting for us there.
:{{DIcon}} This might be the last stop in our search.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 06.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I can't think of any connection I have with Vimara Village, though. I've only been there once, and it was pretty uneventful.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Whatever the case, the only way we'll know is if we go there.
:{{DIcon}} Just be sure not to push yourself too hard.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915502 layla 08.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Thanks, but I'm fine. I'm used to pushing my limits... I know how far I can go.
;(Obtain {{Item|Picture Left by the Wisdom Seelie}})

;(Go to the place shown in the picture)
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Let's see... This should be the place. Nothing seems out of the ordinary...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Maybe the Seelie didn't prepare anything for us this time? Or, does it want us to knock on the door first...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' *groan* If we're wrong about this, it'll be super awkward...
:{{DIcon}} Layla.
:{{DIcon}} Calm down.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' You're right. I can't always be like this... Sometimes, it's better to take action than overthink every little thing.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 05.ogg}} '''Layla:''' *inhales and exhales*
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 06.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Uh, hello? Is anyone home?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 01.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Coming! Just a moment.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 02.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Oh, it's you, Layla. How nice of you to stop by again.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Huh...?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 08.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Do... do you know me?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 03.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Haha, that's no way to greet a friend. Of course I know you.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 04.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Is this a friend of yours? Or perhaps a classmate?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 09.ogg}} '''Layla:''' A friend. We, um... I'm having a little trouble with my thesis, and we happened to be passing by...
:{{DIcon}} What's going on, Layla?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 10.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I&mdash;I don't know, either... I don't even know where to begin...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 11.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I recognized him immediately &mdash; he's one of the people that was getting robbed by the Treasure Hoarders.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 12.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But he shouldn't know anything about me... He shouldn't even know who I am.
:{{DIcon}} You said you've been to Vimara Village once...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 13.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yeah, but that was before the robbery. I was just passing through...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 14.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Even if he saw me, he wouldn't know who I am... He didn't notice me during the robbery.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 05.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Is something the matter?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 15.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Uh, I appreciate your kindness, but I really can't remember how we met... I'm sorry.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 06.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' So you aren't joking...?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 07.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Do you still remember when my family and I were being robbed by a gang of Treasure Hoarders?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 16.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yes, but I don't think I was of much help to you all...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 08.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' How so? You told us everything yourself the last time we met.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 09.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' My family and I were surrounded by Treasure Hoarders, and I didn't know what to do. But then, we heard people approaching in the distance.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 10.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Those Treasure Hoarders were the first to hear them coming and started to flee the moment they sensed the situation wasn't going their way. They didn't even bother taking anything with them.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 11.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' I wasn't sure what had happened, but the Treasure Hoarders were scared off. I immediately grabbed my wife and child and got out of there.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 17.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Oh, I see... I'm so glad that you and your family were unharmed.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 12.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' I thought it was a party of adventurers that happened to pass by, but later you told me that you had spotted us and ran to find help.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 13.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' You were amazing! You managed to keep a level head, even in the midst of danger.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 14.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' I know you have a Vision, so those Treasure Hoarders wouldn't have been a match for you. But, they might've harmed me and my family if their backs were pushed against the wall.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 18.ogg}} '''Layla:''' W&mdash;Wait, that's not exactly what happened... I still regret not helping out sooner.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 19.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Anyway uh... When did I come here last? I don't seem to remember.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 15.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Hmm, it's been some time, but not too long ago. I don't recall exactly when. What's wrong, nothing's coming to mind?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 20.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Nope... I'm sorry, I still can't seem to remember, even after everything you've told me. Maybe I'm just under too much pressure...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 16.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' You came over and ate with us, and you played games with my son. *sigh* If only we had taken a picture...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 17.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Oh! You forgot a package here from that visit. You'll definitely remember once you see it!
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 18.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Wait here, I'll go fetch it.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 21.ogg}} '''Layla:''' A package? I left a package here...?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 22.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Huh!? Wait, this is it!
:[[File:One Final Step Lost Talisman.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 23.ogg}} '''Layla:''' This is the talisman that I lost, the one that my mother made for me...
:{{DIcon}} What the... Is it really the same one you lost?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 24.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yes, this is definitely it. She made it herself &mdash; it's the only one of its kind.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 25.ogg}} '''Layla:''' There's also a letter here. Was I planning to send it to someone? Let's see who the recipient is...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 26.ogg}} '''Layla:''' "To Layla"?
:{{DIcon}} I'm assuming you aren't in the habit of writing letters to yourself.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 27.ogg}} '''Layla:''' No! I swear I've never done anything like that. What is going on...? Let's open it and see what this is all about.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 28.ogg}} '''Layla:''' "Hello, Layla. It must've been quite the endeavor to follow the Seelie's hints all the way here. Great work."
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 29.ogg}} '''Layla:''' "Self-reflection is a wonderful quality to possess, but you'll only end up hurting yourself if you overdo it."
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 30.ogg}} '''Layla:''' "Failure is a stranger to no one. The purpose of self-reflection is not to indulge in the pain of failure, but to succeed in your next attempt."
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 31.ogg}} '''Layla:''' "If you're reading this letter, then you have succeeded in taking the first step."
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 32.ogg}} '''Layla:''' "On the back of this letter is the core information that your thesis is lacking. It's actually been done for a while now &mdash; it only feels inconclusive because it's missing a concise summary to tie it all together."
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 33.ogg}} '''Layla:''' "I hope that this journey has provided insight for your life ahead. From the bottom of my heart, I wish you courage as you carry onward, and hope that you fulfill the expectations you hold."
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 34.ogg}} '''Layla:''' "Always watching over you. Sincerely, the Wisdom Seelie."
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 35.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Oh... *sobbing*
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 36.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I thought... I thought we were going to fail. I thought that... everything we did and all the time we spent was for nothing...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 37.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But the Seelie wasn't messing with me after all.
:{{DIcon}} Could it be that the Wisdom Seelie... is you?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 38.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Hah, I doubt it... I mean, unless I somehow came here while I was unconscious, and don't remember it.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 39.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Although having said that, I have heard rumors claiming that I sleepwalk a lot. Hmm...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 40.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But even then, that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm actually the Wisdom Seelie. It could have just helped me while I was sleepwalking.
:{{DIcon}} Either way, it's safe to say that it's related to the blessing from the stars.
;(Stress Value &minus;2)
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 41.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I'll write back and ask to meet with the Seelie, and see how it responds.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 42.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Even though I still have a lot of questions, this experience was fruitful enough.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 43.ogg}} '''Layla:''' If it wasn't for your encouragement, I probably would've quit halfway through and holed up in the Akademiya somewhere...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 44.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Perseverance really does pay off.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 19.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' I'm not sure if I understand what has happened... but it's something good, right?
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 45.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yes, it's something really, really good, and I'm very thankful for it.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 20.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' Well then, since you're already here, why don't you stay and have something to eat? We just finished preparing some food.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 46.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Oh, uh...
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 21.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' C'mon, don't be a stranger. Your friend should join us as well. You can leave your troubles until after the meal.
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 mundhir 22.ogg}} '''Mundhir:''' You must relax and gather your strength so you can take on the challenges ahead, am I right?
:{{DIcon}} He's right.
;(Stress Value &minus;2)
:{{A|vo lylcop001 1915504 layla 47.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Alright, thank you all. I can do this!
