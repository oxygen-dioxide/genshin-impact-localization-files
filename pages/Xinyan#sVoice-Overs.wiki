|vo_01_01_tx         = Xinyan's the name, an' rock 'n' roll's the game &mdash; and I'm the only one who plays it in [[Liyue Harbor]]. Been thinking about staging concerts elsewhere lately, but... Hmm... Well, word is that you've been all over the place, Traveler. So, what say you sign me up for your world tour? Anywhere's good!

|vo_03_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} When It Snows.ogg
|vo_03_03_tx         = Hmm... How do we attract more folks in this weather? Right! How about we stage a rock 'till you drop snowstorm endurance challenge?
|vo_03_04_title      = When the Wind Is Blowing
|vo_03_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} When the Wind Is Blowing.ogg

|vo_04_04_tx         = Me? Oh, I've got a guitar to maintain, tunes to rewrite... I mean, I just got offstage, there's no way I can sleep right now.

|vo_05_01_title      = About {name}: Frightening
|vo_05_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Frightening.ogg
|vo_05_01_tx         = Not afraid of me, are you? Some folks say I've got eyes like knives, that I don't wear my clothes right, that I don't speak right. They give me a pretty wide berth, too. Really, can't a girl sport her own style without being looked at like she's some weird creature outta who-knows-where?
|vo_05_02_title      = About {name}: Rock 'N' Roll
|vo_05_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Rock 'N' Roll.ogg
|vo_05_02_tx         = Rock 'n' roll came to [[Liyue]] from [[Fontaine]], so I guess you could call it a new thing. But it's not too hot around here. Most think it's an awful racket not fit for human ears. And that's why I appreciate everyone who does come listen, haha!

|vo_06_01_title      = About Us: The Audience
|vo_06_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - The Audience.ogg
|vo_06_01_tx         = You wanna hear me play? Come to the front &mdash; it sounds best from there! *clears throat* Alright then, comin' at you from the one and only rock stage in Liyue!
|vo_06_02_title      = About Us: Kindred Spirits
|vo_06_02_friendship = 6
|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Kindred Spirits.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = And here I was wonderin' why we got on so well! So you're not from this world, and that's why you don't care for its rules. Now that's how life should be like! Lose the red tape, and live free!
|vo_06_03_title      = About Us: Invitation
|vo_06_03_friendship = 6
|vo_06_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Invitation.ogg
|vo_06_03_tx         = I'd sure love to add some extra flavor to my rock 'n' roll. Wanna get on the drums next time? You've got a good sense of rhythm. ...You've never played? Don't sweat it, it's a question of soul, not skill! Give it a go, I just know you'll be great!

|vo_07_01_title      = About the [[Vision]]
|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = I'm guessin' that I'm the only person in Teyvat who uses the fire from their Vision in rock performances. Some say I should respect that power more... But the way I see it, the gods gave the Vision to me, so they like my style, don'cha think?
|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share: Opera
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Opera.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = You ever heard of opera? It's what those rich guys listen to at their banquets. It's all tenor this and falsetto that... Getting so uptight about music, ugh &mdash; it's just not rock 'n' roll.
|vo_07_03_title      = Something to Share: Naming
|vo_07_03_friendship = 4
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Naming.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = I made this guitar myself, y'know? Based it off a rock 'n' roll instrument from Fontaine at first, but it stopped looking like the original real fast. I wanted to give it a rad name, like "The Fyre Lyre," or "The Jadebreaker," or "The Hill Stiller." Still, feels like we're missin' something... Any ideas?
|vo_07_04_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_04_tx         = My favorite stage outfit's one I made by hand outta [[Silk Flower]]s. You must've seen those flowers before, haven'tcha? Passion-red, they are &mdash; a perfect match for my music!

|vo_08_01_title      = About [[Xiangling]]
|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Xiangling.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = I have dinner at the Wanmin Restaurant often. If Xiangling's got some time on her hands, we'll chat till it's real late. Eh? You wanna know what I order? See... I actually eat everything she makes. It's never the same thing, and the flavor's different each time, too. Ooh, she's the rock star of the culinary world, she is!
|vo_08_01_mention    = Xiangling
|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Zhongli]]
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Zhongli.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = There was this one fellow who invited me to perform at his place, back when there weren't many who would give my music the time of day. I was touched, let me tell you what. Like, hey, someone gets it! I agreed right away... But when I got there, I found out that he was the consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. What a weird guy. I mean, how was that appropriate?
|vo_08_02_mention    = Zhongli
|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Ningguang]]
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Ningguang.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = Y'know, the Millelith used to get in my way all the time. Can't set up a stage here, can't perform there. Real bother, it was... Ahem. But after I wrote to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, I heard that the Tianquan amended one of Liyue's... Uh, some rule or something. She designated some spots for performances to take place, so long as you apply. *sigh* It's still a load of trouble if you ask me, but it's better than being harangued by those Millelith every time, so...
|vo_08_03_mention    = Ningguang
|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Baizhu]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Baizhu.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are the tops at preserving my voice. I did an impromptu performance for him as thanks, but... the [[Changsheng|snake he keeps around his neck]] fainted away. Haha, now it ducks up Dr. Baizhu's sleeve every time I'm around. I only discovered afterwards that snakes are very sensitive to vibrations.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Baizhu,"The snake he keeps around his neck"
|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Beidou]]
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Beidou.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = Her? She speaks her mind and has a big heart, and we get on great. The Crux's adventures are real epic. They've given me tons of inspiration in the past! I even wrote them a song. Nowadays, I just need to sing the first line, and most all the sailors will join in. It's fast becoming a new sea shanty, it is.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Beidou
|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Chongyun]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Chongyun.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = He's one interesting guy. He looks introverted enough, but there was this one time when he came to one of my performances. A [[Xingqiu|friend]] brought him or something, and he had some words for me, but I couldn't hear 'em over the music. Before I knew it, he was right up there on the stage with me, singing and rockin' his heart out. Guess you really can't judge a book by its cover!
|vo_08_06_mention    = Chongyun,Chongyun's friend
|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Hu Tao]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Hu Tao.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = I've no clue what she's thinking, going around looking all happy-clappy like that when she's the head of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Always greets me cheerily too, saying "I like people who play with fire, they're good for business" or somethin' like that... She's a bit bizarre, I tell you.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Hu Tao
|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Yun Jin]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Yun Jin.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = Tell you a secret &mdash; but you gotta keep it that way, you hear? She's real fond of rock 'n' roll. Comes to watch me at least three times a week no matter how packed her schedule is. You'd think that the head of Heyu Tea House's troupe would be into finer arts and all, eh? But I guess it gets suffocating after a while. Haha.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Yun Jin

|vo_09_01_title      = More About {name}: I
|vo_09_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 01.ogg
|vo_09_01_tx         = You wanna know more about me? Well, aren't you just odd? Most people would do just the opposite. Well, where should we start? ...Eh, guess we'll start with rock 'n' roll.
|vo_09_02_title      = More About {name}: II
|vo_09_02_friendship = 3
|vo_09_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 02.ogg
|vo_09_02_tx         = Back when I was little, the adults all said I had to be more girly, that I should learn and study all these things. Wasn't ever any good at it, though, and I'd often get roasted bad. Rock 'n' roll's a different story. No one ever taught me, but I can do it just fine. And of course, the adults say "that's unladylike!" *sigh* Talk about prejudice.
|vo_09_03_title      = More About {name}: III
|vo_09_03_friendship = 4
|vo_09_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 03.ogg
|vo_09_03_tx         = Say, do you notice anything different 'bout me today? I did some facial massages to relax my mouth and eyes, and practiced smiling less broadly in front of a mirror for half an hour. So, how'd it go? Do I look a bit less fierce than usual? ...Even scarier? Huh, okay...
|vo_09_04_title      = More About {name}: IV
|vo_09_04_friendship = 5
|vo_09_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 04.ogg
|vo_09_04_tx         = Thanks for staying to jam with me! It's almost time for lunch. I've brought your share as well! We've got tomatoes, sausages, fried eggs... Say what? I don't seem like the type? H&mdash;Hey now, don't you look down on me. M&mdash;Making a nice-looking meal was no problem at all!
|vo_09_05_title      = More About {name}: V
|vo_09_05_friendship = 6
|vo_09_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 05.ogg
|vo_09_05_tx         = I believe in rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance, but I don't think it means that I have to go around shoving it in people's faces. I'm perfectly capable of living normally. I can sew, I can grow flowers and keep fish, and make nice-looking meals. I'm allowed to like anything... or anyone I want, right?

|vo_10_01_title      = {name}'s Hobbies
|vo_10_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Hobbies.ogg
|vo_10_01_tx         = Hobbies? Rock 'n' roll, of course! You ever have that something you put your all into? When everything you love comes together into one thing, the place and time loses all importance. You just need to enjoy it to the fullest, and express yourself to your hearts content! I can never get enough of that feelin'!
|vo_10_02_title      = {name}'s Troubles
|vo_10_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Troubles.ogg
|vo_10_02_tx         = I send children a-crying every time I accidentally lock eyes with them on the road. *sigh* If only there was a way to make me look a little less scary. But I've tried everything, and nothing sticks...
|vo_10_03_title      = Favorite Food
|vo_10_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_03_tx         = The lunch down at the Liyue dockyards rocks! Oily, meaty... Bit skimpy on the vegetables, but I could never get tired of it! Far as I'm concerned, a whole day in the dockyards is worth it just for the lunch!
|vo_10_04_title      = Least Favorite Food
|vo_10_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Least Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_04_tx         = Not that I'm picky, but I can't stand bland food. If it's supposed to be salty or spicy, make it salty or spicy! You can't have a good time if you don't go all-in on the flavor! Even if all I had on hand were enough ingredients for one serving of [[Jewelry Soup]], I'd make sure I'd do right by them!
