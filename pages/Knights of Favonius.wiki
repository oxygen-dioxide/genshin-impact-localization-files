{{Description|An order responsible for protecting Mondstadt and its belief of freedom. Despite its members are known as knights, none has been knighted by any royalty {{sic|-|hide=1}} knighthood is a title they earned from the noble duties they assume.|World Map description
}}
The '''Knights of Favonius''' is the order of knights that protects [[Mondstadt]], founded by [[Vennessa]] with the help of [[Barbatos]] 1,000 years ago, to prevent aristocrats from ruling the land, as Barbatos originally intended.

The knights act as the lawmen of Mondstadt, keeping its citizens safe and creating and upholding laws for all.

Currently, the Grand Master, [[Varka]], is out of Mondstadt on an expedition with his squad. In his place, [[Jean]], who holds the title of Dandelion Knight and Lionfang Knight, is filling in as the Acting Grand Master.

==Hierarchy==
The Knights of Favonius are traditionally led by a single Grand Master, with a reserve stepping in to perform the Grand Master's duties as an Acting Grand Master should the Grand Master be unavailable or otherwise indisposed.

Knights of Favonius tradition dictated that the titles of 'Lion' and 'Wolf' were reserved for those of great leadership potential. Such individuals would one day assume the position of Grand Master, devoting themselves to the leadership of a multitude of knights and the safeguarding of Mondstadt.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Sword}}</ref> As such, the Grand Master and Grand Master's Assistant are knights that have gained one of these two titles. So far it seems that 'Knight of Boreas' counts as a 'Wolf' title, but is more specialized so not everyone with a 'Wolf' title is a Knight of Boreas.

Serving under the Grand Master are the Captains, of which there are ten.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaeya|More About Kaeya: II}}</ref> [[Albedo]], [[Eula]], [[Kaeya]], and [[Hertha]] are currently the only known Captains.

There are other subdivisions within the Knights of Favonius, such as the Outriders.

Becoming a squire can be part of the path to knighthood. 16-year-olds are eligible to become squires.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Guy}}</ref> Further information about squires is not known.

==Key Personnel==
Many people have acted as key members of the Knights of Favonius over the course of the game, with each of them assigned a particular job.

The principal knights so far are listed below:

===Outriders===
{{Quote|The Knights of Favonius once had a formidable team of archer scouts known as the Outriders.}}

The Outriders were a subdivision of the Knights of Favonius, established and led by [[Amber's grandfather]]. They were trained in his style of archery and use of wind gliders, and were renowned for their skill. However, after his abrupt disappearance, the Outriders lost their discipline and skill while rumors milled that he had defected from the Knights of Favonius. Eventually, they were all but obsolete, with Amber remaining as the division's sole member.

==Companies==
===The Cavalry===
This company is headed by [[Kaeya]]. All the members of this company (except Kaeya) are currently on Varka's expedition.
[[Diluc]] was the captain of this company before Kaeya.

===Investigation===
This company is headed by [[Albedo]]. The Investigation company appears to provide the Knights with inventions to help aid their endeavors, and investigate interesting phenomenon, which were likely discovered by the 4th company.

===Intelligence===
Similar to the Intelligence department of the [[Adventurers' Guild]].

===The 4th Company, Reconnaissance===
This company is headed by [[Eula]]. They often go into the wilderness of Mondstadt to perform reconnaissance and keep an eye on any approaching enemies or strange phenomena. They are likely one of the major sources of information for the 6th company and the Investigation company.

===The 6th Company, Logistics===
This company is headed by [[Hertha]]. This company's work are the charter and administration of the baggage train, resource management, and record-keeping. They are currently gathering help for potential missions of the Knights, such as [[Bounties|dangerous monsters]] and [[Reputation#Weekly Requests|troubles of Mondstadt's citizens]] in exchange for some surplus of resources.

===The 8th Company===
This company likely deals with Magic. Its field officer, [[Nymph]] is one of the company's only known members, with [[Lisa]] having been a potential candidate for captain. It is likely they are the elemental combatants of the Knights, as opposed to the {{Color|Physical DMG}} largely utilized by the other companies and captains.

===Outriders===
This company is headed by [[Amber]], who is also the sole member. Outriders appear to be a mix of the Investigation and Reconnaissance companies.

==Trivia==
*"Favonius" is the Roman name for the Greek god {{w|Anemoi#Zephyrus|Zephyrus}}, the god of the west wind.
**The Japanese translation for "Favonius" is {{Lang|mini=1|ja = {{Rubi|西風|セピュロス}}|ja_rm = Sepyurosu|ja_tl=West Wind (Zephyros)}}.
**This is quite fitting as [[Vennessa]], the Falcon of the West of the [[Four Winds]], founded the Knights.
*The official English translation of the [[manga]] translated the Knights of Favonius as ''Ordo Favonius'', Latin for the "Order of Favonius."
**Therefore, the Knights of Favonius may have been inspired by the Teutonic Order.<!--how?-->
*The [[Favonius Series]] include various lore and history pieces about the Knights of Favonius.
*Similar to knighthood training in real life, training to become a member of the Knights of Favonius can start at a young age and last for many years. The exact path to knighthood is not known, but it can be gleaned from dialogue and history of various characters who attained knighthood or are looking to attain knighthood.
**[[Guy]] began training at age 8, learned how to wield a sword at age 10, and became a squire at age 16 before becoming an official Knight at an unknown age.
**[[Ellin]], who is young enough to "have some imagination left"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Child's Secret}}</ref> and is also not yet old enough to sign up with the Knights of Favonius,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Herman}}</ref> is also training hard so that she can pass the tryouts.
**Several years ago, [[Noelle]] failed her seventh selection test.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Noelle|Vision}}</ref> The selection test is likely the exam that Noelle studies for in her second hangout, [[Knightly Exam Prep]]. Given that the exam is half a year away at the time of her second hangout, it could be an exam that can only be taken yearly.
**[[Diluc]] became the youngest ever Cavalry Captain<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|2}}</ref> at the age of 14.<ref>Manga, Chapter 2: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga/detail/298 Flame Born]</ref> As captaincy is generally not an entry-level position, Diluc was likely already a Knight for some time, and he must have begun training at a young age like Guy did.
*The sword that most of the Knights use resembles the [[Traveler's Handy Sword]].
*The Knights of Favonius are mentioned in the descriptions of several Furnishing items:
** [["Ballad-Spinning Windwheel"]]
** [["Night of the Party Pumpkins"]]
** [[Black-Back Hound]]
** [[Bountiful Harvest Fruit Cart]]
** [[Breeze-Blessed Bed]]
** [[Favonius Coat of Arms]]
** [[Favonius Conference Table]]
** [[Favonius Office Table]]
** [[Fir Case Shelf Combination]]
** [[Landscape Painting: Distant Clouds]]
** [[Mondstadt Rug: Crimson Ardor]]
** [[Ordinary Garden Hedge]]
** [[Pine Street Light]]
** [[Pocket-Sized Pine Cabin]]
** [[Pure Spirit Banner]]
** [[Rally Banner]]
** [[Two-Tier Library Bookshelf]]
** [[Wrought Iron Carved Street Light]]
