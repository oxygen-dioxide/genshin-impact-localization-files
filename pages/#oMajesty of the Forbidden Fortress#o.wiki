|description    = A display model based on [[clockwork meka]] and [[Pneumousia]] installations that can be found in the [[Fortress of Meropide]]. Only the appearance is the same as the original, as it possesses none of the original's most basic functionality. In theory, programming a clockwork meka to patrol a specific area and equipping it with the intelligence to maintain law and order requires regular maintenance from an engineering specialist, and that doesn't come cheap. As a purely ornamental decoration, it requires none of the high capital costs or difficulties of maintaining an operational device. Preserving only the outward appearance and majesty of the original is certainly a valid option.
