'''Automaton Attack''' is a weekly [[Reputation Request]] that occurs in [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|[[Yashiori Island]] is experiencing a spot of automaton-related trouble. [[Satou]] hopes that someone can help quell the trouble.}}
#Defeat the [[Automatons]]

==Request Details==
Help Needed:<br />
"Please destroy the monsters wandering around [[Yashiori Island]]." That was the commission I received.<br />
At first, it didn't look like anything special, but then... it said that there'd be automatons as well!<br />
With my abilities, that's never happening... so could someone please take this commission off my hands? The reward's all yours!
