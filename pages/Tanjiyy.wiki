;(First interaction)
:'''???:''' Greetings, my yet-to-be-friend! Be you a traveler who frequents these trails?
:'''???:''' Apologies for halting you halfway along your path but... Um, could you enlighten me as to the events that transpired here?
:{{DIcon}} I'm (Traveler). Pleased to meet you.
:'''Tanjiyy:''' Tanjiyy, Vahumana Dastur, at your service. I came here to provide... educational assistance to the... Ah, yes, the Tanit.
:'''Tanjiyy:''' This whole affair is most odd. This should be the right place, but... Oh, how did things turn like this...
:{{DIcon}} It's... a long story.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they... migrated.
:'''Tanjiyy:''' Could be a tribal warfare, or some kind of internal conflict, hm? Very interesting. It's been centuries since a conflict occurred in these sands that saw an entire tribe annihilated.
:'''Tanjiyy:''' Additionally, I discovered signs that I found most... ominous. I recommend against checking yourself. It's... revolting, and will likely make you retch.
:'''Tanjiyy:''' Perhaps it might have been the work of survivors among them — survivors who later returned to gather most of the... abandoned belongings. Alas, I cannot be sure. Either way, it was a highly disquieting scene.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:'''Tanjiyy:''' *sigh* How did I encouter something like this? I feel like I've witnessed an event that'll make into the history books...
:'''Tanjiyy:''' Ahem. Anyway... would you like to play cards?
:'''Tanjiyy:''' I found a few decks in those tents, and they're still in a decent state — after some cleaning, that is. If you're interested, perhaps we could have a game or two...
:{{DIcon}} I don't mind.
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Haha, then let's begin! Let's see... I have three decks here. What do you think, which one do you want to challenge? For the record, I'm really good at this.
::{{DIcon|TCG}}(Challenge the deck with dark-colored stains on its card box...)
::{{DIcon|TCG}}(Challenge the deck with blade marks on its card box...)
::{{DIcon|TCG}}(Challenge the deck with claw marks on its card box...)
::{{DIcon}} Uh, I'll pass...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I'm not in the mood.
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Ah... Mm, I understand. My apologies... Take care.

;(Consequent interactions)
:'''Tanjiyy:''' Ah, it's you! Never thought you'd come back!
:{{DIcon}} You're still here?
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Haha, yeah, I've reported everything I discovered to the Akademiya and applied for a new project...
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Now, I'm going to figure out what on earth happened here...
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Mm, this will add a nice footnote to my historical research.
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Don't worry about my safety. The General Mahamatra's keeping an eye out for us. He's promised to provide abundant supplies and protection for the researchers sent here.
::{{DIcon}} Historical research...?
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' Yeah, why do you look so surprised?
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' The legend of the God King is part of history, Parvezravan's family affairs are part of history... and so is the mysterious tragedy of the Tanit.
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' To put it simply, think about these questions: How do we piece together the fragmented truth?
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' What purpose did the record-keeper hold when they wrote down those words? What were they thinking?
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' ...All of them are history.
::{{DIcon}} Did you find anything?
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' Did I find anything? Hmm... How about a remianing belief in the Goddess of Flowers? Eh, I'm afraid whatever is left of that belief has been wiped out now — it's gone for good.
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' And... I found many books smuggled out of the Akademiya. The amount is very huge if I do say so.
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' Some of which are completely foreign to me... Uh, for instance... these are books about "flims." What did they want these for?
:::'''Tanjiyy:''' But apparently, we were wrong to presume that the desert folks were illiterate fools who would turn their noses up at knowledge... They were truly extraordinary.
:{{DIcon}} How about a round of Genius Invokation TCG?
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Haha, a fellow player, huh? Lucky me!
::'''Tanjiyy:''' I have three decks here. Take a look. Which one do you want to challenge? Just for the record, I'm pretty good at this.
::{{DIcon|TCG}} (Challenge the deck with dark-colored stains on its card box...)
::{{DIcon|TCG}} (Challenge the deck with blade marks on its card box...)
::{{DIcon|TCG}} (Challenge the deck with claw marks on its card box...)
::{{DIcon}} Uh, I'll pass...
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Ah... Okay, we'll play next time when you're in the mood.
:{{DIcon}}Bye.
::'''Tanjiyy:''' Safe travels!
