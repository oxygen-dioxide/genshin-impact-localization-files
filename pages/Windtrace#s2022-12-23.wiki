{{Description|Windtrace, the classic game that hands down Mondstadt's history, is once again being held! Players shall be split into two sides: the Rebels, members of the ancient resistance, and a Hunter sent by the ancient aristocracy, who will then have a contest of wits in the Contested Zones.}}
'''Windtrace''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 3.3]].

==Event Details==

===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial

|text1  = During the Windtrace event, players will be split into two sides to play the "Rebels" and the "Hunter."<br>The Rebels must avoid the Hunter's pursuit and hold out till the time expires.<br>The Hunter's task, on the other hand, is to capture all the Rebels within the stipulated time.
|image2 = Tutorial Windtrace 2.png
|text2  = The Hunter not only possesses faster Movement SPD and greatly decreased Stamina consumption, but can also use extremely powerful Windward Arts. Their Windward Arts have the ability to seek the opposition out, expose their disguises and more.<br>As for the Rebels, they can use their Windward Arts to disguise themselves as specific objects on the map, place bait, or temporarily enter a hidden state.
|image3 = Tutorial Windtrace 3.png
|text3  = During the game, "Favors" will descend upon the area at random.<br>Picking up one such "Favor" will help charge one's "Secret Favor," an art that can be decisive in determining victory or defeat.

|text4  = Take part in Windtrace to obtain Windtrace Coins. Accumulate them to unlock all sorts of prizes.<br>When forming a custom Co-Op party to play this game or when your Windtrace Coins have reached the current maximum, you will not obtain any Windtrace Coins.

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wooden barrels and wooden crates}}.<br>The showdown between Rebels and Hunters continues in the Underground Mines. Although certain areas were shrouded from sight thanks to highly clustered architecture, the bulk of this location is wide and barren of cover. Perhaps patience will be the deciding factor in this face-off...

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|dead wood and stones}}.<br>Here, Rebels can maneuver in any direction they want through these expansive ruins while Hunters claim a bird's eye view from above the battlefield. With victory yet to be claimed, neither side has much of a reason to depart prematurely.

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|coral thickets and stone lanterns}}.<br>Should the Rebels and Hunters use their imagination, they will find this a zone unlike any other. Though the open terrain looks like it offers no cover from sight, the canny can use the pools and thickets of corals to mask their presence, and perhaps seize the ever-fleeting initiative before their foes can.

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wooden basins, vases, wooden stools}}.<br>In this ordinary village, fences and stone walls offer basic cover while the houses and low cliffs provide easy bulwarks against prying eyes. Unfortunately for the Rebels, the layout is known to the Hunters as well.

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|dead wood and scarecrows}}.<br>The terraced fields during harvest were not only excellent places for the resistance forces to conceal themselves but an excellent source of materials that could be used in the grueling struggle against the aristocracy. Of course, the Hunters would also watch this place, and they would dispatch elites to encircle the weaker Rebels...

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|archaic baskets, archaic street lamps, and wooden crates}}.<br>All present in this wooden arena must be alert with their eyes and feet as not only must they be aware of foes hidden amidst the surroundings, but also the danger of plummeting after a single missed step.

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wooden barrels, large tanks, and wooden crates}}.<br>In what looks to be a logistical hub meant to fuel a war, Rebels can find ample objects and opportunities to hide themselves. Yet, atop the overlooking heights, the Hunters have the whole area in their sights. To claim victory, one might just need to take to higher ground...

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|hay rolls and wooden crates}}.<br>The clarion calls of conflict have been sounded in this small sleepy town by the resistance.<br>The complicated terrain, rolls of hay, and haphazardly-placed wooden crates can help the Rebels get through this trying time.<br>But the path that runs from the north to the south of the village is narrow indeed, and there is a high chance of running into a Hunter, so it is best to exercise caution!

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wine kegs and street lights}}.<br>The contention between Rebels and Hunter plays out by the countryside manor.<br>The tall structure and the dense vineyard rows are excellent places for the Rebels to cover their tracks. The nondescript wine kegs and streetlights will also serve as good concealment.

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|dead wood and scarecrows}}.<br>The battle between the resistance and the nobles continues in the village.<br>The terraces at harvest time provide natural visual concealment, allowing those who disguise themselves as dead wood or scarecrows to blend right in.<br>But the overall terrain is plain to see and the Hunter can reach the high ground to survey all beneath them and thus pick out any suspicious characters.

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|old wooden boxes, old wooden barrels, and stone lamps}}.<br>The ruins and old abandoned wrecks would often be overlooked by the aristocracy due to their extreme danger and the harsh living conditions there, which made them difficult places to hide in. However, some survivalist Rebels would take advantage of this view to set up a base there. However, some Hunters with extremely good instincts would come to such places to conduct independent investigations. Thus would some unexpected confrontations come to be...

==[[File:Icon Windtrace.png|30px|link=]] Windward Arts==
All original Combat Talents will be replaced with "Windward Arts". Travelers can select the Windward Arts they want to use before the game starts.

Secret Favors are Windward Arts that can be picked up that replace the Elemental Burst.

===[[File:Windtrace Rebel.png|30px|link=]] Rebel===
* If you play as a Rebel in the game, after the game starts, you must constantly move and hide to avoid the Hunter until the time limit is up. The longer a Rebel remains uncaught, the more Windtrace Coins obtained. At the end of the stipulated time, if one or more Rebels are left on the field, victory goes to the Rebels.
* During the preparation phase, the Rebels need to quickly find good hiding spots, use their Windward Arts to disguise themselves as designated objects within the current map, place bait, or cleverly use the environment to hide and evade the Hunter.

===[[File:Windtrace Hunter.png|30px|link=]] Hunter===
* If you play as a Hunter in the game, after the game starts, your task is to capture all the Rebels within the stipulated time. The various Arts of the Hunter can be used to detect the location of the opposing side and leave them shorn of their disguises.
* The more Rebels a Hunter captures in the game and the less time it takes to capture the Rebels, the more Windtrace Coins obtained. At the end of the stipulated time, if the Hunter captures all the Rebels, victory goes to the Hunter.
* During the preparation phase of Windtrace, the Hunter is enclosed within an opaque blue wall. They cannot leave the enclosure, nor can they see where the Rebels go. However, the opaque blue wall is short enough that in certain maps, Rebels in very high locations may be spotted from within the enclosure.
* After the activity starts, the Stamina consumed by the Hunter in sprinting, climbing, and gliding will be greatly reduced.
* The Hunter's usage of the "Sensor Aura", "Mysterious Hunch", and "Capture!" Windward Arts is visible to all Rebels who have the "Co-Op Teammate Effects" graphics setting set to "On" (not "Partially Off" or "Off").
