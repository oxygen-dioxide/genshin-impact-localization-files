==Text==
{{MC|Mr.|Ms.}} {{Traveler}} and Ms. [[Paimon]], it's me, [[Blanche (Fontaine)|Blanche]]!<br>
Surprised? You didn't expect me to write so soon, right? Hehe!<br>
Actually, it's nothing. I just found some super huge, super sweet Bulle Fruits. I've had a lot of them in my life, but ones like these are a first! As such, I wanted you to have some too.<br>
I hope they are still fresh when you read this letter.
