|description    = A plain and durable censer, equipped with a sturdy stand and convenient carrying rings, commonly found in the domains of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]].<br>It is said that these censers are repurposed from old ovens, making them extremely cost-effective and long-lasting. However, due to their unique shape, they are not recommended for beginners in meditation, as their appearance may invoke distracting "feelings of hunger."
