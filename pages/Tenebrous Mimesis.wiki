'''Tenebrous Mimesis''' are an enemy group that are found in [[Natlan]].

Unknown plant-like monsters from [[Abyss|another world]], Tenebrous Mimesis will take on the form of various enemies to attack the player. While in a transformed state, the mimesis is protected by a [[Void Ward]] and is invulnerable to damage until the ward is destroyed, which will briefly stun it in the process.

They will also apply stacks of '''Attrition''' upon hitting the active character, causing them to lose a percentage of their Max [[HP]] after a delay, which ignores shields.

==Lore==
Tenebrous Mimesis have the ability to extract memories from the [[Ley Line]]s to mimic various physical forms and their abilities. The complexity and power of the forms they can mimic in this manner depend on the ability of each Tenebrous Mimesis variant. Just as they are able to mimic various monsters, they can also assume the form of animals (e.g., cranes) and objects (e.g., Exquisite Chests).
