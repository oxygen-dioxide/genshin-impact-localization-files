==Steps==
# Defeat the Fatui

==Request Details==
===Request from Shams===
{{Quest Description|The Fatui are rampant...}}
Help Needed:<br />
When we were hanging out in Inazuma before, we got to see the {{Color|buzzword|Fatui}} walking around like they owned the place.<br />
Bunch of speculating, business-ruining, trouble-making, rent-seeking louts.<br />
I have no wish to see these people hanging out around {{Color|buzzword|near Sumeru City}} &mdash; anyone who bumps into them while leaving the city is going to have a bad day for sure.<br />
Now, I'm not afraid of them, no sir, but it would be safer for everyone if the Corps of Thirty could send some able hands to get rid of them, wouldn't you agree?

==Enemies==
===Request from Shams===
{{Enemy List|Fatui Skirmisher - Cryogunner Legionnaire;Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard;Fatui Skirmisher - Geochanter Bracer}}
