{{Description|[[Guoba]] loves to eat spicy food. Problem is, his stomach can't handle something this spicy.}}
'''Guoba Attack''' is [[Xiangling]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|each breath|1}}
* After 2s from skill activation, Guoba will breathe fire at opponents every 1.5s, '''4''' times. Guoba exists on-field for a total of 7s.
* After Xiangling gains her first Passive Talent, [[Crossfire]], Guoba's breath attack hits in a 5-meter-long cone in front of him with a diameter of approximately 1.5&nbsp;meters at max range.
* Unlike [[Explosive Puppet]] and [[Jumpy Dumpty]], this skill can not activate pressure plates.
* Guoba can be picked up by [[Gust Surge]].
* {{Talent Note|character=Xiangling|talent=Guoba Attack|snapshot|Flame DMG}}
* Shortly before each attack (about when the exclamation mark appears above his head), Guoba applies Pyro to himself. This Pyro aura cannot be interacted with for the most part, but Sucrose's [[Astable Anemohypostasis Creation - 6308]] as well as Faruzan's Pressurized Collapses can trigger Pyro Swirls on Guoba (known as a "Guoba Swirl") if timed correctly. Additionally, Guoba's Pyro aura is eligible for absorption by most Anemo abilities that can absorb elements.
