==Profile==
Andrei is the account manager at the Liyue branch of the Northland Bank. During the day, he will be working at the bank and he will be enjoying the scenery at Liyue Harbor dock during the night. He tries to promote that the Northland Bank's loan is much better and they also higher interest return on saving, which he said anyone wouldn't find in other Liyue local lenders. He is aware that many Liyue locals still harbor resentment towards the bank, thinking that their presence here may be damaging the Liyue economy. But he believes that the bank could be an opportunity that benefits everyone. He is grateful to [[Pantalone]] and the [[Tsaritsa]] for Snezhnaya's prosperous economy.

===Appearance===
Andrei takes the appearance of a tall man with brown-colored hair and blue eyes. He wears the typical Snezhnayan outfit alongside a pair of brown leather gloves, a pair of black glasses, and a brown cap.

:'''Andrei:''' Welcome! How may I assist you today?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Andrei:''' I am the account manager here at the Northland Bank. Feel free to find me for help with any matters you'd like to take care of in the bank.
::'''Andrei:''' If you're interested in a loan, I can assure you that our interest rates are better than any of the local lenders you'll find around Liyue.
::'''Andrei:''' You'll also find our savings accounts much more competitive as well. Our interest return on savings will surely be higher than any local lender!
::'''Andrei:''' So no matter what your business may be, Northland Bank can always be the first to meet your banking needs!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Northland Bank.
::'''Andrei:''' This is actually a Snezhnayan bank that was opened here in Liyue Harbor. The building itself was constructed in accordance with the local Liyue style.
::'''Andrei:''' However, many Liyue locals still seem to harbor some resentment towards our bank. They think that our presence here may be damaging the Liyue economy.
::'''Andrei:''' But this clearly can be an opportunity that benefits everyone. As long as we can be fully integrated into the marketplace, the economy will only continue to grow more.
::'''Andrei:''' As for our own nation's economy, we have the brilliance and foresight of Master [[Pantalone]] to thank.
::'''Andrei:''' Oh, and we mustn't forget Her Majesty the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Andrei:''' We look forward to your next visit with us. Please find me for any business matters that require assistance.

::'''Andrei:''' I'm sure you've been enjoying all that Liyue Harbor has to offer?
::'''Andrei:''' As a native of Snezhnaya, I was initially quite reluctant about being transferred to Liyue by the Northland Bank.
::'''Andrei:''' But as I came to understand more about Liyue, I found myself liking it more and more.
::'''Andrei:''' Things like the sea here and the city's atmosphere are all quite different from my home, haha!
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your home.
:::'''Andrei:''' My hometown is not quite as lively as the bustling city of Liyue...
:::'''Andrei:''' And I've completely fallen in love with the food in Liyue. With such a variety of colors, flavors, and aromas, the cuisine here is simply exquisite!
:::'''Andrei:''' But even so, I could never turn my back on Her Majesty the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
