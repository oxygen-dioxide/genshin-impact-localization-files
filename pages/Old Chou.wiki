==Profile==
Old Chou was formerly a member of the [[Treasure Hoarders]] alongside [[Tang Wuchou]] but left the group after hitting it big in the mines, eventually opening up a strange store in the outskirts of the Chasm. He gave Tang a [[Smaragdus Jadeite]] necklace. However, his old crew came for him and threatened him into buying their low-craft goods to sell in Liyue, causing him to lose a profit.

The [[Traveler]] would be sent to Old Chou by Tang to find some valuables for him, upon which he wondered where his old crew was as they had not come to blackmail him recently. The Traveler told him of their apprehension by the [[Millelith]], which he was delighted with.

===Personality===
Old Chou dislikes the Treasure Hoarders after he left them due to hurting his new business. He laughed when he learned that they were all apprehended by the Millelith. He is also quite protective of his valuables, as Tang states that he usually surrounds the valuables in his game with explosive barrels and ends the game when a participant digs one of them up. He is also somewhat shady about the origins of his goods and explosives, claiming the latter to be duds but expresses apparent surprise when they explode.

===Appearance===
Old Chou appears as a [[Treasure Hoarders: Gravedigger]], but lacking the face mask.

==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Plays upon talking to Old Chou for the first time.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Old Chou:''' Ya-hey, you'll miss out if you just walk about! Come on, try digging for some treasure instead!
:'''Old Chou:''' How about it? Are you interested?
:'''Paimon:''' What is this, anyway? Do you mean that we can dig up treasure somewhere amongst these piles of dirt?
:'''Old Chou:''' Of course... you might, ahaha!
:'''Old Chou:''' These piles of earth are filled with anything from cabbages to ore. There's some truly good stuff in there, too!
:'''Paimon:''' Good stuff, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Can't we just keep digging till we get the good stuff, then?
:'''Old Chou:''' No, of course not. Now, I'm not going to lie to you, or my name's not Old Chou! See, some piles of dirt also have explosives hidden within them. You can keep digging so long as you don't dig any of those up.
:'''Old Chou:''' But once you do, it's game over &mdash; game over!
:'''Paimon:''' Explosives? That sounds like a dangerous game we're playing here.
:'''Old Chou:''' Oh, no worries, these were all pilfer&mdash; I mean, borrowed on the sly many years ago from the underground mining camps. They're definitely duds, right down to the last one!
:'''Old Chou:''' So, how about it? Want to have a go?
:{{DIcon}} Let's give it a go!
:;(Starts minigame)
:{{DIcon}} I think I'll pass...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Plays upon talking to Old Chou for the second time onwards.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Old Chou:''' Hey there! Wanna come "dig for treasure"?
:{{DIcon}} Start digging.
:;(Starts minigame)
:{{DIcon}} Where's the treasure, huh? You sure you're not cheating us? ''(Unlocked after digging up bombs 3 times)''
::'''Old Chou:''' No, no I would never do that! Now, your man Old Chou here's not a man of fancy birth, no sir, but I can at least claim to be an honorable person!
::'''Old Chou:''' You know what? C'mere, let me give you a hint for all your trouble.
::'''Old Chou:''' So, get this… the best stuff is always surrounded by the most explosives. For example, the four tiles around a treasure chest will all contain explosives!
::'''Old Chou:''' Only two of the tiles around ore will contain those explosives, and the tiles that surround a tile with no treasure at all will most certainly be free of any danger.
::'''Old Chou:''' So what I'm saying is, don't be too discouraged if you dig up a couple of explosives. There's light at the end of the tunnel ー you'll see!
:{{DIcon}} How did you end up setting up a stall here?
::'''Old Chou:''' *sigh* Well, it's a long story. I was once a Treasure Hoarder, doing some business near The Chasm. Uh, please, put your sword away. I've turned over a new life and gone legit.
::'''Old Chou:''' Of course, I did have some Mora stashed away when I split from the crew, but it all went down the drain after a while due to... some circumstances. As such, I was forced to set up shop here and earn a little cash that way.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Old Chou:''' Alright then. See ya!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Plays while the minigame is active.''

{{Dialogue start}}
;(After starting the minigame)
:'''Old Chou:''' The game's begun! Get digging in that plot of land on my left!

;(Dig up an explosive)
:'''Old Chou:''' Kaboom! Haha, that's game over. Hey, hey, don't touch that. I can't guarantee that it won't explode!
:;(Game ends)
:;(If the explosive is detonated)
::'''Old Chou:''' Eh!? It exploded... That's unexpected. Now, where will I get another one of those...

;(Dig up the first treasure chest)
:'''Old Chou:''' Alright, that's a wrap! Eh? You got something already? Not bad, not bad.
:;(Game ends)

;(Dig up the second treasure chest)
:'''Old Chou:''' Alright, we're done! ...What? You got that one? Ugh, should've hidden it a bit deeper down...
:;(Game ends)

;(Dig up the third treasure chest)
:'''Old Chou:''' And that's a wrap! Congratulation, you got the grand prize! This has never happened, not since I set up shop here. Very impressive!
:;(Game ends)

;(Talk to Old Chou after reaching the daily limit for the game)
<!-- This only shows up during certain time of a day. The time is not fixed. Try changing to a different time to trigger this. -->
:'''Old Chou:''' Huh? Wow, you sure went through the whole lot really quickly. Um, g&mdash;give me a moment to reset the tiles, would you?
:'''Old Chou:''' Just, ah, go busy yourself elsewhere for the time being while I get set up again... And no peeking during that time, you hear?

;(Talk to Old Chou after digging up 3 treasure chests from the minigame)
:'''Old Chou:''' You'd like to go for another round? Well, you're a real good sport, make no mistake, but I can't set this game up with all my grand prizes in your pockets. You've got to wait for a while, if you don't mind.
