;(On obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's about time to meet up now. Let's head to the spot Mualani mentioned.

;(Approach Mualani, [[Karya]], and [[Viramdra]])
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! Over here!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're here, Mualani. Oh, and those strange scholars are here, too.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Good morning, you two.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Morning!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' So when are we leaving?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Haha, seems you're as excited as a child before the start of our journey.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' I just want to get down to business as soon as possible... You know this is no leisurely spring stroll, so I hope we can all act a little more professional.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Don't worry, I'm a very professional guide. Ahem, our journey to the mysterious island has officially begun.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' First, do you all see this statue here?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm. Is it an important clue?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, no. It's not a clue at all. He was the first chief of the [[People of the Springs]] who came back from the mysterious island and set up this place. It's a monument.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The first thing we need to do before we set off is to touch the statue and pray to our ancestors. This will make our journey to the mysterious island smoother.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 viramdra 03.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Is there any theoretical basis to support that claim?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Theoretical basis? No, but my teacher taught me it's an essential step before heading to the mysterious island.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 viramdra 04.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' ...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Very good! You didn't try to argue with me over something that you aren't knowledgeable about. That's very professional of you.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 viramdra 05.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Sure, but since this practice doesn't have an empirical basis, I won't be able to include it in my thesis...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Come on, everyone!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Greetings to my ancestors. As your descendant, I'm about to follow in your footsteps and witness your accomplishments. Allow me to depart under your gaze and return under your protective watch.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It really feels like we're about to embark on a great adventure!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Now, please get ready. We're going to look for the first clue.

;(After the dialogue)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, where should we look for the clue?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Heh, at a place where many gather... like a party!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Following the map's instructions, Mualani leads you to a valley where vast pods of [[Koholasaur]]s gather...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach a group of Koholasaurs instead of the marked location, optional)
::{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's try not to disrupt them!
:;(The player is teleported to the marked location)

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, there are a lot of Koholasaurs here!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' As expected, the first clue is related to the Koholasaurs.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' When people from outside the tribe get a copy of the map, most can deduce that the first clue is related to the Koholasaurs, but they often end up looking in the wrong direction.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' When the first chief created the map, he left a special mark for this part. It's a code that the tribe uses to indicate a herd of them.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So, it'll be impossible to gain any leads from just finding one or two stray Koholasaurs.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're a real pro at this, Mualani!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' But according to the information I've been able to find, Koholasaurs don't like gathering as herds unless it's to compete for the hot springs...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So let me tell you a secret that only a guide from the People of the Springs would know. It so happens that wild Koholasaurs periodically gather in the valley up ahead.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It's almost like how our tribe gathers together for festivals. Still, as soon as the season changes, the herd quickly disperses again.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Unless you're a guide who's always running across [[Natlan]], it would be very rare to ever witness such a thing.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 viramdra 03.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' This is a thing!? I need to note this down right away, and include an explanation as a part of my thesis...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' According to what I've deciphered from the map, a clue is hidden deep in that valley.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But to get there, won't we have to get through the herd of Koholasaurs?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hmm, we'll have to think of a way to sneak past without startling them. They're gathering together with their friends, so I'm sure they don't want to be disturbed.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' You mean, we're going to have to walk through the Koholasaur herd? That feels a little...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 viramdra 04.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Ahem... Given we've agreed to work together, everyone should do their part. However, Karya has been attacked by Koholasaurs before, so this isn't an ideal plan for her.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 viramdra 05.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' But it shouldn't be a problem at all for me! Let's have Karya wait here and I'll take over all the tasks that were supposed to be entrusted to her.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, no worries. We don't need everyone to go.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We actually need someone to stay and look after the luggage, so we'll leave that to you two. {{Traveler}}, Paimon, please come with me.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 viramdra 06.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Is that so? Then that works out perfectly.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' And now I understand how much you care for your assistant scholar.

;(After the dialogue)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Follow me and stay close.

;(Talk to Viramdra and Karya, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq004 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' How much I care? I was just trying to practice good crew resource management.
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq004 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Viramdra and I will keep an eye on the luggage. We'll leave the rest to you!

;(Follow Mualani and be spotted by the Koholasaurs)
;(If the player followed Mualani)
::{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 16.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh no! We've been spotted!
::{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 17.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's back off and try again.
;(If the player did not follow Mualani)
::{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Careful, don't startle them.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These Koholasaurs sure seem on guard. We'll never get through...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Given you've already used the information provided by the map to deduce that the clue is in that valley, why don't you simply chase them away? You're pretty strong, aren't you?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' First of all, the elders of the tribe have always warned us to never hurt the Koholasaurs. Doing so will almost certainly bring bad luck.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' And secondly, you can't just show up and intrude on others' gatherings, much less make them leave! That's just terrible!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' But on what basis...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Okay, so can we figure out another way to enter the valley?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hmm, there must be a way to enter the valley without startling them. It'd take a while for me to come up with a solution on my own, so I'd like to ask everyone to help come up with some ideas.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let Paimon think... is there a detour or another way around?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' According to the map, the clue is right in the middle of the Koholasaur herd. Even if we try to approach from the other side, we'll just run into the same problem.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, this is tricky...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Karya, I've noticed that you only talk when you're trying to help smooth things over between Viramdra and the others. I'm sure you must have some ideas of your own, so why don't you share them with us?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 karya 02.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Me? Alright... When Viramdra decided to look for leads on the Koholasaurs, I wanted to help, and so, I also looked up some information about the creatures.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 karya 03.ogg}} '''Karya:''' I discovered something very interesting... We thought that the Koholasaurs relied on their hearing to track their prey, but they also possess a very keen sense of smell.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 karya 04.ogg}} '''Karya:''' But, I'm not sure how useful that information is...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh... oh! That was actually very useful, Miss Karya!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 karya 05.ogg}} '''Karya:''' You can just call me Karya.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' In that case, please stay here and keep an eye on the luggage. {{Traveler}}, Paimon, come with me. I've got an idea!

;(Talk to Viramdra, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq004 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Why can't we just chase the Koholasaurs away?

;(Talk to Karya, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq004 karya 02.ogg}} '''Karya:''' Good luck! I'll keep an eye on the luggage.

;(Approach the Koholasaurs, optional)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 3 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' This way! If you go now, they'll definitely take note of us.

;(Approach the [[Sprayfeather Gill]]s)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Found it!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's this...?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The key to making our way through the herd!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' If the Koholasaurs have a keen sense of smell, then even if we try to sneak around and stay out of sight, they'll still notice us once we get close enough.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But this plant can help us solve that problem, because its fragrance is very similar to the scent of a Koholasaur.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We can apply the plant's extract to our bodies and trick their sense of smell!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we're gonna... rub plant juice on ourselves?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Don't worry, it's also good for your skin.
:{{Black Screen|Mualani collects some of the plant's extract and masks everyone with its fragrance.}}
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon feels all wet and slimy... but this actually does smell like a Koholasaur!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Perfect! Okay, let's try to make our way through again!

;(Approach the Koholasaurs again and follow Mualani)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Be sure to stay out of sight!
<!--A young Koholasaur appears from the bush-->
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' What's that sound!? Careful!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It's just a young Koholasaur... Don't worry, this little one doesn't pose any danger.
<!--Continue following Mualani-->
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' How could there be so many here? We can't get through...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, I have an idea. Wait here!
<!--Wait at the rock-->
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Noot-noot!
<!--Mualani distracts the Koholasaurs-->
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Come on!
<!--Continue following Mualani-->
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Careful, don't startle them. <!--This line also appears when straying off-path and approaching an alert Koholasaur-->

;(If the Traveler falls behind Mualani)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 2 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Follow me and stay close.

;(If the Traveler moves too far away from Mualani)
::{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Careful, don't startle them.
::{{Black Screen|You're too far from Mualani...}}
:;(Approach Mualani near the Sprayfeather Gills to start again from "Mualani collects some of the plant's extract and masks everyone with its fragrance.")

;(If spotted by the Kaholasaurs again)
::{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 16.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh no! We've been spotted!
::{{A|vo mlnlq004 4 mualani 17.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's back off and try again.

;(Pass through the Koholasaurs)
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We must be getting close.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, a bunch are gathering around that rock. What're they doing?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hmm, maybe when things start to get boring, they gather together and talk about something fun? Too bad I can't understand what they're saying...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, Paimon thought guides from the People of the Springs could understand Koholasaurs.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Sounds like someone has been trying to trick you.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' True, they were definitely trying to scam us... Huh? Do you see that on the rock? It looks like some kind of... drawing?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I've heard that there is a type of moss that changes color when it reacts to the biological signals released by Koholasaurs. But to trigger that sort of reaction, you'd need a huge number of Koholasaurs...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That must be the clue!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Should we take a picture?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The flash might disturb them. Let me try to copy it down.
:{{Black Screen|Mualani copies down the mossy drawing and quietly leads you back the way you came. You then tell the patiently waiting Viramdra and Karya everything you saw and heard.}}
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we've passed the first stage of the journey now, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 viramdra 01.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' I see... Had we chosen to drive the Koholasaurs off, then we never would've found this lead... Seems there was a logical basis for everything you said after all.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Has he always been this way, Miss Karya?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 karya 01.ogg}} '''Karya:''' He's just obsessed with his research, that's all...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' At least this has shown that my judgment is correct. I've proven my trustworthiness. And so, there should be no need for us to argue next time.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 viramdra 02.ogg}} '''Viramdra:''' Yes, I understand... and I suppose that'll help us avoid wasting time.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mualani really knows how to lead our group!
:{{DIcon}} She is a professional guide, after all.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Next, we'll need to use the lead we found to uncover our next destination. Now, what does this pattern represent?
[[File:Map Left Behind by the First Chief Image.png|x150px]]
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hard to tell... Paimon certainly doesn't have any idea what it's trying to get at.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Aha! I got it!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Though the lines are kinda rough, I can still see that they represent the boundaries between the water and the land at Jadeskirt Knoll. We can use this to fill in the hole on the map and...
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Find our next destination!
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? You got all that just from some rough lines?
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Well, intuition is also a part of it. Maybe I've just seen too many maps as a guide, and now it's easier for me to pick up on patterns like that.
:{{A|vo mlnlq004 5 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Seems like our break time is over, let's get ready to move!<ref group=Note>Actual spoken voice line: "Alright, break time is over, let's get ready to move!"</ref>
