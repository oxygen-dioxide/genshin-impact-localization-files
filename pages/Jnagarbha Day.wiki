==Steps==
# Wait till 08:00 - 12:00 the next day
# Go to [[the Akademiya]] to meet up with [[Alhaitham]]
# Enter the Akademiya together with Alhaitham
# Enter the [[House of Daena]]
# Hide for now and wait for an opportunity
# Find a way to connect to [[Nahida]]'s consciousness
# Go to the Akademiya
# Lure the Akademiya guards into the trap
# Go to the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]]

==Achievements==
* Completing the quest grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[The Longest Day]]''.

==Gameplay Notes==
* From Step 5 until Step 9, the player will enter a "special story mode." Upon leaving this mode, including leaving the area or dies during Step 7, they will be teleported to the entrance of the House of Daena at Step 4. The current party will be restricted in the following ways:
** Only the [[Traveler]] for Step 5 and Step 6. Use of the [[Map]] is disabled.
** Only a trial [[Nilou]] in Step 7. Nilou can open the Map, but cannot use any [[Teleport Waypoint]]s.
** Step 8 is a quick time event featuring [[Isak]] in disguise.
* Upon reentering the House of Daena after leaving the special story mode, the Traveler will be given the following Story Review and the quest will continue from the step the player exited from.
** You and Alhaitham go to the Grand Sage Azar's office to look for a way to free Nahida.<br />However, the Grand Sage, who is well-prepared, sends you into confinement and exiles Alhaitham. But everything seems to go as planned...<br />''(added after Step 6)''<br />In the confinement room, you manage to awaken Nahida's sealed consciousness using the modified Akasha Terminal.<br />''(added after Step 7)''<br />Meanwhile, Nilou dances outside of the Akademiya, which then triggers the faked order Alhaitham has implanted into the Akasha, causing all the guards in the Akademiya to rush into the city.

{{Quest Description|The Akademiya's Jnagarbha Day has finally come. All your plans and preparations are for one purpose, and one purpose only &mdash; to save a god.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After passing time)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Today is the Akademiya's Jnagarbha Day. We can finally put our plan into action!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alhaitham should be waiting for us. Let's go to the Akademiya and find him!

;(Approach Alhaitham)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Hello, you two. Sleep well?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, not really... Paimon got too nervous thinking about today and didn't fall asleep until the sun was almost up...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about you, Alhaitham?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Naturally, I slept just fine. After all, a good rest should be considered part of the plan, since energy is an important resource.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You just wanna show off how calm you are!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's crucial to dissipate any tension before we execute our plan.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The only thing you're doing is being annoying!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Anyway, do you need me to go over the game plan again?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, just in case.
:{{DIcon}} I want to confirm everything again.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Our target is Grand Sage Azar's office. Everyone in the Akademiya knows that's where the Grand Sage's console is. Only they can operate it.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Many restricted commands and operations are executed via that console. I'm sure that console has a way to free Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, Paimon's been thinking... What kind of technology could let the sages imprison even a god?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' That isn't something they could've accomplished with their scholarly talents alone. In the Sanctuary of Surasthana, there's a device of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's that she once used to isolate herself while meditating.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Five hundred years ago, the Grand Sage at the time modified the device so that it can no longer be controlled from the inside. They're effectively trapping one god with the power of another.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, uh, how are we gonna get to the Grand Sage's office?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Don't forget, today is Jnagarbha Day, arguably the most important day to the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The sages and core Akademiya personnel are busy loading the latest batch of research developments and legal decrees into Knowledge Capsules, so that they can be entered into the Akasha.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' All the Darshans' researchers have their noses to the grindstone, and the Akademiya's grounds are flowing with all sorts of people. It's the perfect time for an infiltration.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' When the Grand Sage leaves his office to supervise the entering process, that's our cue to access the console and free the Dendro Archon.
:{{DIcon}} When you put things that way...
:{{DIcon}} The plan feels a bit unrefined.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 13.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Well, yes. That's just the visible side of our plan, after all.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 14.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' If precedence holds, the Akademiya should have already started preparing for Jnagarbha Day.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Everyone should be in position. All that's left is for us to lead the charge!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 15.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Let's go.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... So are we just going to walk in through the front door? Or...?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 alhaitham 16.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...Yes? Were you expecting a stealthier approach?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, Paimon can't think of a good comeback... Alright, it's all on Alhaitham if things go south.

;(Enter the Akademiya)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 01.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' ...S&mdash;Scribe?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 02.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' Please wait. Are you Scribe Alhaitham?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh!?
:{{DIcon}} Calm down, Paimon...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' That's me. Is something the matter? I'm in a hurry.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 03.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' Ah, n&mdash;no, I was just surprised to see you here. I had heard that the sages were looking for you not long ago, but I didn't know what for.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 04.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' And, um, also... Please don't bring outside guests into the Akademiya.
:{{DIcon}} (This isn't looking good...)
:{{DIcon}} (We were noticed...)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Outside guests? How did you arrive at such a conclusion? Your groundless inference shames the Haravatat Darshan.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 05.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' W&mdash;What did you say...? I'm the top student in Haravatat, and I earned third place at the last inter-Darshan debate. Don't look down on me!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' That wasn't my intention. As your Haravatat senior, I just assumed that you possessed a greater aptitude for critical thinking.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 04a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 04b.ogg}}--> '''Alhaitham:''' Look. Based on what you already know, the purpose of my return and the reason they're here should be obvious.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 06.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' I&mdash;Is that so... Wait a moment &mdash; let me think. Don't tell me the answer!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 07.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' The sages' search for you... A {{MC|m=blond|f=blonde}}-haired traveler... Outside guests...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 08.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' So, from the start... the sages weren't looking for you, but this traveler? And you were gone from the Akademiya for so long because...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Hey, shh... Yes, you've proven yourself as the top student in Haravatat. I surmise you have arrived at the correct conclusion.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 09.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' As I expected! Please forgive me, I wasn't thinking clearly just now. Thank you for getting me back on track.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's nothing. We'll be on our way, then.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 viraf 10.ogg}} '''Viraf:''' Alright. Thank you for your contributions to the Akademiya, Scribe.
:;(Alhaitham, the Traveler, and Paimon continue into the Akademiya)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the heck just happened now...? What did he just guess?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I'm afraid I don't know either.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You have no idea!?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Mhm. He convinced himself of whatever truth he came up with.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' That is the so-called "pride" of a scholar. If someone questions their academic facility, they will instantly feign understanding to keep up appearances.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Nowadays, the Akademiya is rampant with this type of scholar. Their obvious farces of intellect only serve to highlight themselves as fools.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, so there are special ways to deal with smart people. We don't even need to make up our own excuses...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 4 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' We shouldn't waste any more time. It would be problematic if we missed our window of opportunity. Let's go.
----
;(Enter the House of Daena)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this the Akademiya's library?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 21 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Indeed. Known as the House of Daena, it is quite possibly the most extensive special collections library in Teyvat.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 21 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, there are a lot of students going through here... Is it really okay just to waltz right in?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 21 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The Akademiya marches to a fast beat, especially since it's Jnagarbha Day. They're all occupied with their own matters.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 21 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Just act natural. Now, hurry along.

;(Walk past the guards)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's this platform for?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's a lift that Akademiya personnel use to access higher floors.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are we gonna take it, then? The Grand Sage's office is up there somewhere.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' No, not right now. We can't guarantee that we won't run into the Grand Sage. Let's step back and observe for now.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You think the Grand Sage will exit from there?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And after he does, we'd sneak past him...? Paimon thinks that's really dangerous...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Who knows. However, if we can confirm Azar's current location, our operation will be much safer if we...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 01.ogg}} '''Azar:''' ...Allow me to offer you a hint. If you wish to know his location, look behind you.
:{{DIcon}} !?
:{{DIcon}} Busted...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah, y&mdash;you're... What's Grand Sage Azar doing here!?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Hmph...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 02.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Do not tell me you believed the Akademiya would not grow suspicious of you after such a prolonged absence... Scribe.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 03.ogg}} '''Azar:''' An eyewitness had informed me of your whereabouts, so I came to personally welcome you.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Grand Sage, I didn't expect you to care so much about me. I'm truly flattered.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 04.ogg}} '''Azar:''' I'm sure, but compared to you, I am far more interested in these two unexpected guests. You are... the Traveler and Paimon, correct?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 05.ogg}} '''Azar:''' It's a pity that only now have I been afforded the opportunity to formally meet two of Sumeru's most esteemed guests. I do apologize for my lack of decorum.
:{{DIcon}} Let's talk.
:{{DIcon}} It's not too late for you to stop.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 06.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Excellent, you immediately initiated discussion instead of attempting to prepare some perfunctory excuse. You clearly understand the situation at hand and have no intention of making a reckless stand.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 07.ogg}} '''Azar:''' The foot traffic here renders this place unsuitable for discussion. Please, follow me to my office.
:;(The Traveler and company are brought upstairs)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This place is crawling with guards... There's no way out for us...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 08.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Alright then, Traveler. What did you wish to discuss with me?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 09.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Today is Jnagarbha Day, so I still have many responsibilities to attend to. There is little time for idle chit-chat before I detain you all.
:{{DIcon}} The Fatui are not to be trusted.
:{{DIcon}} The Fatui have ulterior motives.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 10.ogg}} '''Azar:''' You seem to know quite a bit about our endeavors...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 11.ogg}} '''Azar:''' If that is so, then you should be praising our great work, rather than using your trivial misgivings in a futile attempt to sway me.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Trivial...?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 12.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Then tell me: What do the Fatui want from me?
:{{DIcon}} A Gnosis?
:{{DIcon}} ...Maybe benefits of some kind.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 13.ogg}} '''Azar:''' ...Tch, worthless.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 14.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Those are all completely worthless. Benefits, divine power... These materialistic words do nothing but debase our great work.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 15.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Creating a god... Yes, we are using human wisdom to create a god!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 16.ogg}} '''Azar:''' If humanity cannot attain omniscience and omnipotence, then we shall create a god to reveal them! This is the pinnacle of human wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 17.ogg}} '''Azar:''' We shall regain a god's guidance at long last. No longer will we flounder in the interminable void of consciousness and knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 18.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Even Irminsul will be freed from its plight.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 19.ogg}} '''Azar:''' For our nation of scholars, this is the ultimate aspiration &mdash; no cost is too great to realize it.
:{{DIcon}} You say it's the pinnacle of human wisdom...
:{{DIcon}} But in the end, you're still relying on a god.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 20.ogg}} '''Azar:''' You will never understand the rapture of having a god be born within your very hands. With your degree of knowledge, you cannot even comprehend such an emotion.
:{{DIcon}} What about Lesser Lord Kusanali?
:{{DIcon}} It's not like Sumeru didn't already have a god of its own.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 21.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Gods exist on a plane that far eclipses humanity's. Lesser Lord Kusanali... What can she even do?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 22.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Care for the people? Fend off sandstorms? Fabricate silly fairy tales? These are but child's play for the Akademiya. Does that make us equal to the gods?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 23.ogg}} '''Azar:''' We are a people favored by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. Though I may have personally not seen it, our forefathers bore witness to "true wisdom."
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 24.ogg}} '''Azar:''' The ascension of the Lesser Lord has brought nothing but bewilderment to the scholars. They all ask, "Is that truly what true wisdom is supposed to look like?"
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 25.ogg}} '''Azar:''' With that in mind, it is better to keep her isolated in the Sanctuary of Surasthana so our academy will not become embroiled in turmoil.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a pathetic justification! Do you really think that only the super smart or powerful should be able to call themselves gods?
:{{DIcon}} (I don't know what I can say or do.)
:{{DIcon}} (The arrogance of the scholars...)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 06a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 06b.ogg}}--> '''Alhaitham:''' As per your judgment, Grand Sage, they are indeed dangerous individuals...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Not only are they acting against the Akademiya, but their ideologies have the potential to lead scholars astray. Looks like there really was merit in my assignment.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alhaitham...? Are you talking about us?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Anyway, I've brought them to the Akademiya as ordered, but it took some time and trouble.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Oh, that reminds me, here's the investigation report you had requested.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 10b.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's a summary of my time spent with the Traveler. An array of information about {{MC|m=him|f=her}}, ready for your perusal.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alhaitham, so you're... You're still on the Akademiya's side!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We finally started to trust you...
:{{DIcon}} We've been set up.
:{{DIcon}} Alhaitham, you...
:;(Azar examines the Knowledge Capsule)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 26.ogg}} '''Azar:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 27.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Excellent. Detailed contents with no errors... I would expect nothing less than an immaculate report from the Scribe.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 28.ogg}} '''Azar:''' As it is Jnagarbha Day, I'll enter the information on you into the Akasha. ...Surely, you know what that means?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...We'll be monitored, just like Cyno.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 29.ogg}} '''Azar:''' With the Akasha's calculation prowess, all of your actions will be predicted with an accuracy of at least 98%. Furthermore, your data will be updated in real time whenever new information presents itself.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 30.ogg}} '''Azar:''' To put it into words you can understand... Wherever you go, you will be walking under an invisible leash. This is Sumeru's greatest penalty for dishonest persons.
:{{DIcon}} When you say "dishonest persons"...
:{{DIcon}} ...Does that also include your General Mahamatra?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 31.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Are you not familiar with the concept that great responsibility begets an equally great suspicion?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 32.ogg}} '''Azar:''' In any case, you are Sumeru's most concerning external variable. Locking you down will greatly decrease the chance of any undesirable outcomes coming to pass.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're despicable!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 33.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Despicable? Perhaps from your perspective, but... I suppose you had mentally prepared yourselves for this, no?
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 34.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Your ploy was to "sacrifice" the Traveler here, was it not?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...Lord Azar, I know what you're trying to say, but I've been following your plan this entire time. Why are you doubting me at this juncture?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 35.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Hmph, must I delineate your entire plan? Very well, I will spell things out.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 36.ogg}} '''Azar:''' First off, I received an eyewitness report that you were spotted with the Traveler at Caravan Ribat. However, you immediately departed for the desert and escaped surveillance range.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 37.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Judging by the time, you all likely encountered the truant General Mahamatra in the desert... Am I correct?

:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 38.ogg}} '''Azar:''' The Akademiya had not received correspondence from its Scribe for a prolonged time. You were also in the company of the Traveler, a close associate of Lesser Lord Kusanali, and General Mahamatra Cyno, who had defected from the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 39.ogg}} '''Azar:''' With their instigation, what was the probability that you would betray the Akademiya? Rationally speaking... 50%? 70%? What do you think?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Regardless, that's only a guess. The facts are that I've brought the Traveler right before you and I gave you my report.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 40.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Indeed, your boldness deserves praise. To think that despite status as an outlander, the Traveler is still willing to sacrifice for the sake of your plan...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 41.ogg}} '''Azar:''' If I'm correct, you have a contingency plan to save Lesser Lord Kusanali and ruin our great work...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 42.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Sneak into the Akademiya on Jnagarbha Day using Alhaitham's status as the Scribe, for there is a good chance that an opportunity to save the Lesser Lord will arise.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 43.ogg}} '''Azar:''' Should your intentions be discovered, Alhaitham will "turn traitor" and sacrifice the Traveler, thus proving his innocence. He can then stay inside the Akademiya and continue searching for a way to proceed forward.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 44.ogg}} '''Azar:''' As for Cyno... According to the Akasha's calculations, he will soon return to the Akademiya and confront me in person. I suppose this is also a part of your plan?

:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 alhaitham 14.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Even if you impugned me, it would have little effect on you all.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 45.ogg}} '''Azar:''' You misunderstand. Losing our Scribe would irreparably damage the Akademiya's regular operations and the development of Sumeru's future academic systems...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 5 azar 46.ogg}} '''Azar:''' However, under the current circumstances... Even that is trivial compared to what we stand to gain from our great work.

:;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...Now that Lesser Lord Kusanali's consciousness has been forcefully sealed, the core figures of the Akademiya and their guards have started to wear their Akasha Terminals again.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' With The Doctor's technological support, they think they have nothing to fear.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' How despicable of them to rely on such a person.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' But, this is also our chance.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I was originally asked to draft the Knowledge Capsule for the "Artistic Performances Prohibition Act" when I was still at the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It should be on the Grand Sage's desk right now, and will be entered into the Akasha during the next Jnagarbha Day.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are they really going to stop all artistic performances? That's horrible...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I'll make an identical Knowledge Capsule, but this time, I'll "smuggle" some misleading information into it.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' We only need to find an opportunity to switch the capsules. Once it's been entered into the Akasha on Jnagarbha Day, if someone were to be seen performing in public...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The sages would definitely use that opportunity to announce the ban, and so the misleading information will be disseminated amongst the guards.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Sure sounds complicated, but it seems like if everything goes well, we'll be able to get rid of all the guards in the Akademiya without any effort...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' That's pretty clever. Gettin' right into their heads.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I just have one question. Even if we manage to get the misleading info out to the guards, how can we be sure that they'll believe it?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' People who are used to relying on the Akasha become less inquisitive, and their ability to distinguish truth from misinformation is significantly reduced... They will view everything the Akasha releases to them as the unequivocal truth.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The Akasha will turn humans into "machines." I've seen it happen many times.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Yikes... Good thing I didn't wear it for long when I was working in Sumeru City. At first, I thought it was a good thing, too.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' By the way, this plan still requires a performer, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Do you have someone in mind?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Nilou of Zubayr Theater. I know her really well. We can trust her.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I'm kinda hesitant to ask her to participate in a dangerous plan like this, but we can ask her in person.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Alright. After the guards in the Akademiya are gone...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 13 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Then it'll be time for me and my stowaway brothers to shine.

:'''Rahman:''' *whistle*

:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' We still need to eliminate the guards as soon as possible. If we give the sages enough time to realize what's happening, the plan's doomed.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 rahman 03.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Eh, all they've done is to sit on their cushy salaries and twiddle their thumbs all day while we fought and struggled every day in the desert. The only advantage they might have is their numbers.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Speaking of which, most of the guards who report directly to the six sages belong to the Corps of Thirty, but they have a completely different reputation.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Following those blasted sages' every whim, throwing away all the principles of being a mercenary... As someone in the same profession, I'm obligated to teach them a good lesson today.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 rahman 04.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' Indeed. The "trap" has been set. All we need to do is lead them there.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Alright, let's each take a road and herd those scattered guards back into one place. Make sure to attract their attention. Isak will be the key.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 rahman 05.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' You gave such an important task to that child... Will he be okay?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It'll be fine. Isak was so determined to help, so let's put our faith in him.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Besides, even if he's caught, the guards would be too scared to do anything to him... They've never seen Lesser Lord Kusanali in person, after all.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 14 rahman 06.ogg}} '''Rahman:''' You've got a point. Anyway, I think I see them coming. Let's head out.

:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Here comes your savior!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dehya! Hehe, Paimon just knew you would come to rescue us!
:{{DIcon}} You were scared out of your wits just a moment ago...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' You two really owe me some big thanks. I had to search through who knows how many guards to find the key here... It felt even more tiring than whacking 'em! I'm exhausted.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks a lot. Need Paimon to rub your shoulders?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Uh... No, no, that's... Er, I'll pass.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you afraid of? Oh, are you ticklish?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Ugh, now isn't the time to talk about being ticklish...
:{{DIcon}} How are things going outside?
:{{DIcon}} How's Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Things in the city and on Cyno's side are both going well. The guards that stormed out of the Akademiya are all taken care of.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' The Corps of Thirty is in charge of the city's defenses, but we already talked to [[Asfand]]. They've been fed up with the sages bossing them around.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' As long as it doesn't break their employment contracts, they'll turn a blind eye.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's probably because you've been super great friends with them for a long time. So, how's Cyno doing?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' The Grand Sage is in his custody. Even I know how terrible it is to fall into Cyno's hands, so he probably does, too.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Cyno forced him to release Lesser Lord Kusanali. He has no choice but to obey.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 10.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' So, hurry to the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Assuming nothing weird happened...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 11.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...We should've already rescued our archon.
:{{DIcon}} That all sounds amazing.
:{{DIcon}} We managed to rescue her!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 12.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Honestly, I didn't expect our ragtag bunch to do this well. We just came together last minute to save the archon, you know?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 18 dehya 13.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' All right, you two better go. I still have to clean up some messes in the city. See you around.

;(Enter the Sanctuary of Surasthana)
:;(The barrier around Nahida disappears)
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Should I say "It's nice to meet you"?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This is the first time we've met in real life. Before, we've only met in dreams, consciousness, or when I was in someone else's body.
:{{DIcon}} We finally meet, Nahida.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Thank you so much for coming to rescue me, but I also need to apologize...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' During this time, I did some self-reflection. My sense of inferiority and yielding to the Akademiya led to all of this, and created so much trouble for you all.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry about it. You've also helped us a lot.
:{{DIcon}} You deserved to be freed.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! We're here because you're a good archon and one of our friends.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe... Thanks, you two.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Whew... Amazing, so this is how it feels to walk out of that cage with my own body.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's like I just had an endlessly long dream... I can't even tell if I just woke up or was only now born into this world.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' My concept of "self" has become so clear...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But now doesn't seem to be the time to indulge in this feeling.
:{{DIcon}} The Akademiya's god creation plan...
:{{DIcon}} Saving Irminsul...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Um, this is really embarrassing. You all just rescued an archon, and now she needs your help to save her country, and even the entire world.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's okay. With you here, Paimon's sure that everything will work out!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' There's one more thing...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it?
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' For all the things the Akademiya did to me, and for all the folly it committed in the name of wisdom... As their archon, I will make them pay!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! That's the spirit! You're finally standing up for yourself and not letting people walk all over you!
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe... I understand now: To be a better archon, I first need to better myself.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If you haven't even figured out how to be a caterpillar, how can you be a butterfly?
:{{DIcon}} This is knowledge that only you yourself could have discovered.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, true. Hm, that reminds me, I wonder how far along the Akademiya is with their god creation plan...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We need to hurry and prevent the birth of that false god.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I need to make some preparations. Since I'm now free, I can establish a direct link to the Akasha and control it.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' First things first, I need to remove the restrictions that The Doctor put on me in the Akasha...
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' After that, I'll make some adjustments and revoke the sages' permissions. The Akasha will then be like how it originally was: only operable by the archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...After all, the Akademiya betrayed Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's trust.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This might take some time. In the meantime, you should also work on your own preparations.
:{{A|vo xmaq303 19 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If we don't stop the god creation plan in time, we'll be in for a tough fight.

===Optional Dialogue===
If the player leaves the special story mode, two pairs of NPCs may be found in front of the bridge to the Akademiya.
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Mir or Azmi)
:{{A|Vo dialog xmaq303 mir 01.ogg}} '''Mir:''' ...I thought you'd be interested in the Jnagarbha Day ceremony, but you're just out here instead.
:{{A|Vo dialog xmaq303 azmi 01.ogg}} '''Azmi:''' Resting when everyone else is busy makes this moment even more idyllic. *sigh* You still have so much to learn when it comes to romance!
:{{A|Vo dialog xmaq303 mir 02.ogg}} '''Mir:''' Uh... Okay, as long as you're happy.
{{Dialogue end}}

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Phaki or Habi)
:{{A|Vo dialog xmaq303 phaki 01.ogg}} '''Phaki:''' ...You think we'll get yelled at again if we play here?
:{{A|Vo dialog xmaq303 habi 01.ogg}} '''Habi:''' Psh, there's nothing to be scared about. If we can shake Mr. Zubayr, the people at the Akademiya will be a piece of cake.
:{{A|Vo dialog xmaq303 phaki 02.ogg}} '''Phaki:''' But the grandpa with the blue hat and long beard looks really scary... You think he'll be here today?
{{Dialogue end}}

After step 8, the two Akademiya guards who escorted Alhaitham may be found lying unconscious on the road leading southward out of Sumeru City.
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Observe the guards)
:'''Observe the unconscious guards...:''' (Someone has knocked these two guards out and removed their Akasha Terminals not long ago. No one seems to have noticed them yet.)
:'''Observe the unconscious guards...:''' (If they were escorting someone before being knocked out, that person must've escaped.)
