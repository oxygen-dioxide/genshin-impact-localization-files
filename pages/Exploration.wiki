'''Exploration''' in the world of [[Teyvat]] can lead to encounters with various Puzzles, [[Enemies]], Objects, and [[Materials]].

Some objects and puzzles do not have official names, so they are listed with unofficial names.

==Mechanics==
The following are some general game mechanics involved in exploration, including character movement, player abilities, and dynamic processes in the world.

===Player Mechanics===
[[File:Climbing Stamina.png|thumb|Stamina depletes while doing activities like climbing]]
* '''[[Stamina]]''' is an attribute that is used in various combat and movement techniques like Sprinting (or Dodging), Climbing, Swimming, Gliding, and [[Charged Attack]]s. The Stamina meter is displayed as a yellow bar to the right of the character when either depleting or recharging, and will automatically hide itself when fully charged. Players can level up their Stamina meter using the [[Statue of The Seven]] in Mondstadt and Liyue.
** '''[[Climbing]]''' is an exploration mechanic that allows the player to scale most surfaces. While climbing, the player cannot perform combat actions. Climbing costs Stamina, and jumping up costs more Stamina. If the player runs out of Stamina while climbing, they will fall and sustain [[Fall Damage]] based on the distance between the point they fell from and the area where they land.
** '''[[Gliding]]''' is an action that can be performed after jumping off cliffs or ledges, or by jumping while standing in a Wind Current. After taking off, the distance the player can glide for depends on their distance from the ground, as well as their Stamina. The player can stop gliding either by reaching the ground, dropping, using a plunge attack, getting hit by an enemy attack, or running out of stamina. The last four options may result in [[Fall Damage]] depending on their distance from the ground at the point where they stopped gliding.
***'''[[Anemo Ring]]s''' are white, glowing rings that accelerate the player upon gliding through them.
***'''[[Wind Currents]]''', also referred to as Upcurrents and Updrafts, create an updraft which players can use as a jumping point to start gliding, gain altitude while gliding, or restore some Stamina while gliding.
** '''[[Sprinting]]''' is an exploration mechanic that allows the player to move faster and beat timed puzzles. It consumes Stamina and is activated by pressing the sprint button. Some characters have an [[Alternate Sprint]] talent.
** '''[[Swimming]]''' is an exploration mechanic upon reaching deep water, where the water is too deep for the character to stand in. Deep water thresholds varies based on the character's height (child, teenager, or adult). Like climbing and gliding, the player cannot perform combat actions while swimming.
*** Swimming costs Stamina, and swimming quickly costs more Stamina. If the player runs out of stamina while swimming, they will drown and revive at the last solid ground they stood on.
*** Enemies lured into deep water will drown, and their drops will appear on solid ground. However, enemies that were defeated before being knocked into deep water will have their materials drop in the water.
*** {{Color|Cryo abilities}} can temporarily freeze water, allowing the player to traverse large bodies of water without needing to swim across. (This is colloquially known as an "ice bridge.") However, because combat actions cannot be used while swimming, should the ice melt while in deep water, the player will no longer be able to create ice bridges.
* '''[[Elemental Sight]]''' is an exploration mechanic that alters the player's view of the world. While Elemental Sight is active, it displays the names of nearby enemies, color-codes elemental gimmicks, points out interactable objects, and guides the player in certain directions (such as locating Seelies and their courts or tracking down clues and targets during [[Bounties]]).
* '''[[Investigation]]:''' Certain spots around Teyvat can be investigated for [[Artifact]]s, [[Cooking]] Ingredients, [[Forging]] Materials, [[Weapons]], or [[Mora]].

===Obstacles===
{{Main|Obstacles}}
Some of the following obstacles can damage the player or obstruct and hinder movement.

* '''[[Boom Blossom]]s''' are flowers infused with Pyro, Cryo or Electro that, when stepped on, emerge from the ground, spin around, and then explode, spreading its respective element within a certain radius.
* '''[[Bubbles]]''' are objects that can appear in domains and minigames, in [[Ley Line Disorders]] or [[Auras]], or from attacks from certain enemies. The bubbles trap the player inside and can deal {{Color|Hydro DMG}} on impact.
* '''[[Dendro Vines]]''' ''(unofficial name)'' are thorny thickets that can be burned down with {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.
* '''[[Exploding Barrel]]s''' can be encountered during exploration and in some event domains. There are currently three  types: {{Color|Pyro}}, {{Color|Cryo}} and {{Color|Geo}}. Attacking the barrel will detonate it, dealing AoE damage to players and enemies.
* '''[[Hilichurl Structures]]''' are found near hilichurl camps and can be destroyed.
* '''[[Rock Pile]]s''' are {{Color|[[Geo Constructs]]}} that can be broken to reveal chests, cave entrances, and other things.
* '''[[Storm Barrier]]s'''<ref name="map">Official Interactive Map: [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html Teyvat]</ref> are hollow columns of wind that typically surround another object. If the player attempts to run into a barrier, they will be pushed back.

===General Mechanics===
* '''[[Aggravation]]''', also known as aggro, is an enemy {{w|Hate_(video_games)|hate mechanic}} in which enemies are alerted to and attack a nearby hostile entity, such as the player. In Genshin Impact, there are multiple factors that affect when an enemy will become aggravated, such as distance and line of sight.
*'''[[Map]]:''' An interactive representation of the world. There is a minimap in the corner of the screen which can be expanded to view the entire world of Teyvat. [[Teleport Waypoint]]s, [[Statue of the Seven|Statues of the Seven]], and [[Domains]] can be teleported to by selecting them on the Map and pressing "Teleport".
**'''[[Out of Bounds]]:''' Upon approaching an area the player cannot enter yet (indicated by the red border on the map), the screen will gain a dark filter until Paimon appears and forces the player to return to in-bounds areas.
**'''Party Level:''' If your party level is low for a particular area, it will tell you that the area is "Highly Dangerous" in red text when entering said area.
*'''[[Time]]''' passes during exploration, causing the sky to change color. Certain creatures, such as fireflies, are easier to find during nighttime. Some NPCs can only be found during certain times of the day, or change locations depending on the time of day. Through the Paimon menu, the player can manually change the time of day at any point. Some quests also require the player to either wait until a certain time or manually skip to that time.
*'''[[Weather]] and [[Climate]]:''' While exploring the open world, the weather may change. Notably, rain and thunderstorms will apply {{Color|Hydro|Wet}} to characters, enemies, and other objects that can be affected by elemental statuses (such as torches). This can be used to trigger [[Elemental Reactions]] like with normal sources of {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.  During thunderstorms, [[lightning]] can also sometimes strike the player, enemies, or objects and deal {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
*'''[[Grass]]''' is found throughout Teyvat and is treated as a {{Dendro}} object. It will trigger [[Burning]] when {{Color|Pyro abilities}} are used on them. After the effect wears off, the grassy area will be charred and cannot be burnt again until the grass is restored to its original state. Burning grass will continuously deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}} to players or enemies standing in the burning area.
*'''[[Water]]''' is found throughout Teyvat and allows for a variety of movement through and on top of it. When touching the water, any character will get the {{Color|Wet}} status. Water can be swam through, sailed through using a [[Waverider]] in certain places, or frozen by attacking the surface with some kind of {{Color|Cryo}} damage.
* '''[[Waverider]]s''' are boats that players can use to traverse over water. The Waverider was introduced in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] and can be used in [[Inazuma]]. The Waverider has its own special attacks, and can be used in combat. They can be summoned at [[Waverider Waypoint]]s. They can also be used to follow [[Mist Bubble (Exploration)|Mist Bubble]] puzzles.

==General==
===Chests===
[[File:Common Chest.png|thumb|A Common Chest]]
{{Main|Chests}}
'''Chests''' can be found scattered around the world. Some may be hidden, buried, or [[Seal|locked]]. Others may require some extra actions in order to find and open them, such as completing a puzzle or defeating certain enemies. Sealed chests<ref name="map" /> are variants of chests can be found wrapped in Dendro Vines, [[Frozen]] in ice or encased in Geo constructs, requiring them to be [[Burning|Burnt]], [[Melt]]ed or destroyed by physical or {{Color|Geo DMG}} respectively in order to access the chest (the player can also inflict {{Electro}} on a Chest that is Frozen to trigger [[Superconduct]] and remove that ice).

'''[[Shrines of Depths]]''' are ancient structures found around the world of Teyvat which contain Luxurious Chests. There are different shrines found in each region. Players can use [[:Category:Shrine of Depths Keys|Shrines of Depths keys]] to unlock these shrines and open the chest found inside.

The following interactable objects are similar to Chests, but look different and carry different rewards:
*'''[[Floating Crates]]'''<ref name="map" /> are small floating objects found in bodies of water. In [[Liyue]] they yield [[Geo Sigil]]s and [[Mora]] when investigated, while in [[Inazuma]] they drop Mora only.
*'''[[Smashed Stone]]s'''<ref name="map" /> are stone-like crates that contain [[Mora]], usually either 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000. They are currently only found in [[Enkanomiya]].

===Oculi===
[[File:Anemoculus Preview.png|thumb|An Anemoculus]]
{{Main|Oculi}}
'''Oculi''' are collectible orbs of elemental energy found all throughout Teyvat. They are usually hidden or in hard-to-reach places, but are worth the effort of finding, since when offered to the [[Statues of The Seven]], the player will receive great rewards. Three types exist: [[Anemoculus]], [[Geoculus]], and [[Electroculus]]. They can be found using their region's [[Oculus Resonance Stone]]s.

===Seelies===
[[File:Tutorial Adventure Mysterious Seelie.png|thumb|A Seelie]]
{{Main|Seelie}}
'''Seelies''' are small creatures that can be found floating around the world. Upon running into them, they will start traveling down to their Seelie Court (a small structure found on the ground). At certain points, they will stop, and the player must touch them again to get them to continue. Following a Seelie to its court typically rewards a Chest; sometimes, Seelies are used as part of a puzzle.

By using [[Elemental Sight]] near a Seelie or a Seelie Court, the player will be pointed in the right direction, making it easier to track them down.

In [[Dragonspine]], there are special Warming Seelies which, when approached, act as a heat source. They continue to serve that purpose even after they reach their Seelie Courts.

In [[Inazuma]], there are special Electro Seelies which, when approached, move at a high speed.

===Elemental Sigils===
'''[[Elemental Sigils]]''' can be found in chests and on cliffs around Teyvat. There are [[Anemo Sigil|Anemo]], [[Geo Sigil|Geo]], and [[Electro Sigil]]s.

Geo Sigils<ref name="map" /> can be found in Rocky Outcrops, which are small emblems than can be found scattered around the cliffsides in [[Liyue]]. Upon climbing next to one, investigating it will yield 2 [[Geo Sigil]]s.

===Hidden Objectives===
{{Main|Hidden Exploration Objectives}}
Objectives around the world of [[Teyvat]] that are not considered normal exploration and are not officially recognized as [[Quests]] or marked in any way. They tend to be associated with ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' [[achievements]].

==Puzzles==
The following is a list of the various unique objects players can encounter during exploration. These are typically used in puzzles. When properly interacted with, they may spawn a chest, provide the player with access to another collectible, such as an [[Oculus]], or progress a larger puzzle.
* '''[[Bloatty Floatty|Bloatty Floatties]]''',<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Child's Secret}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns}}</ref> colloquially known as Balloon Flowers, are a strange plant that can be found growing near the edges of cliffs. Attacking or investigating them causes the three balloons to pop off and float around the vicinity. Upon popping the flowers, a chest will spawn.
* '''[[Elemental Amber]]s''' are oval-shaped items that, when broken, release their respective element into the surrounding area. There are two types of Ambers, {{Color|Anemo}} and {{Color|Hydro}} Ambers. Anemo Ambers create Wind Currents, while Hydro Ambers make all characters and enemies within a certain radius {{Color|Hydro|Wet}}.
[[File:Elemental Monument Anemo Unactivated.png|thumb|An Anemo Elemental Monument]]
* '''[[Elemental Monument]]s''' or Totems can be lit up by their respective element to progress in domains or solve puzzles.
* '''[[Anemo Slime#Floating Anemo Slimes|Floating Anemo Slimes]],'''<ref name="map" /> unlike their enemy counterparts which start grounded, can be found floating around a fixed path and will not attack the player. Popping all the floating Anemo Slimes will usually yield a Chest, or are sometimes used as part of a puzzle.
* '''[[Seal]]:''' Some objects in the world may posses a red ring with glyphs written in the [[Languages#Unknown Language|unknown language]] appearing around them (typically chests or elemental monuments). This object cannot be interacted with until its requirements are met. The requirement is usually defeating the enemies that spawn near the object, but sometimes it requires completing another puzzle. Some objects, typically chests, will suddenly become locked when the player gets close to them.
* '''[[Ruins Torch]]es''' are torches that can be activated with {{Pyro}}.
* '''[[Time Trial Challenge]]s''' are devices that, upon activation, require completing their objectives within a certain amount of time. The three main challenges are: destroy exploding barrels, defeat all enemies, and open a chest.

===Mondstadt===
The following exploration objects and puzzles are only found in [[Mondstadt]]:
[[File:Anemograna.png|thumb|An Anemogranum]]
* '''[[Anemograna]]''' are [[Grana]] that appear on the ground in sets of three. The grana can be collected by running into them. If the active character collects all three Anemograna in an area, a Wind Current is created at their current location.

;Dragonspine
*'''[[Ancient Rime]]s''' are chunks of glowing ice that cannot be melted with usual {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, but can be melted with Scarlet Quartz.
*'''[[Crimson Agate]]''' can be offered to the [[Frostbearing Tree]] in Dragonspine for rewards, similar to the Statues of the Seven. They can be found scattered in the overworld, in certain chests, or as a repeatable reward from completing a [[Crimson Wish]].
*'''[[Ruin Brazier]]s''' are sources of warmth that mitigate the effect of Sheer Cold for nearby characters.
*'''[[Scarlet Quartz]]''' are red crystals which can be found throughout Dragonspine. When collected, they reduce [[Sheer Cold]] accumulation by 5% and halt the accumulation of Sheer Cold for as long as they remain attached to the player. When a player performs an attack while a Scarlet Quartz is attached to them, the attack deals extra {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. If the player attacks an Ancient Rime, the quartz will melt the ice.
*'''[[Sheer Cold]]''' is a climate effect in very cold areas. After the gauge showing Sheer Cold reaches 100%, the player will start to lose HP. The effects of Sheer Cold can be negated using sources of warmth in Dragonspine as well as Scarlet Quartz.
*'''Snow:''' Throughout Dragonspine are lumps of snow which can be melted using {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. Upon being melted, they may reveal enemies, chests, [[Cryo Crystalfly|Cryo Crystalflies]], or even Seelies.

===Liyue===
The following exploration objects and puzzles are only found in [[Liyue]]:
* '''[[Adeptus Bridge]]s''' are ribbon-like bridges that are found in the abodes of [[Adepti]]. They can be activated, deactivated, and rotated at interaction points.
[[File:Geo lamp unactivated.png|thumb|An unactivated Geo Lamp]]
* '''[[Geo Lamps]]'''<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Geograna}}</ref> are devices activated by leading a [[Geograna]] to it. Activating all Geo Lanterns in an area usually spawns a Chest, though some are also used as part of other puzzles.

* '''[[Pressure Plate]]s'''<ref name="map" /> are devices inlaid into the ground that are activated by either having a character stand on them, or using another object that is counted as a "weight," such as [[Amber]]'s [[Explosive Puppet|Baron Bunny]] or the Geo [[Traveler]]'s [[Starfell Sword]].
* '''[[Windmill Mechanism]]s''',<ref name="map" /> colloquially known as Anemo Pinwheels or Windmills, are items that can only be activated by striking them with {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

;The Chasm
*'''[[Bedrock Key]]s''' are magical arrays set up by the [[Liyue Qixing]] found on the surface of [[The Chasm]].
*'''[[Cage-Shaped Geo Formation]]s''' can be activated with [[Geograna]]s to fire Crystal Projectiles to destroy Bedrock Keys.

*'''[[Spoutrock]]s''' are rocks in The Chasm that enhance the player's jumping ability to quickly reach high places.
*'''[[Unique Rock]]s''' are uniquely shaped rocks found in The Chasm. They will break after receiving a certain number of resonances in a short period time from [[Unique Rock Pillar]]s.
*'''[[Unique Rock Pillar]]s''' are puzzles found in The Chasm. Attack the Unique Rock Pillars with [[Blunt Attack]]s to create resonant quakes to hit and break the Unique Rocks and reveal treasure or new paths.

===Inazuma===
The following exploration objects and puzzles are only found in [[Inazuma]]:
*'''[[Balethunder]]''' is a special [[Climate]] effect found in some parts of Inazuma which have high {{Electro}} concentrations. Players affected by Balethunder will gradually lose HP. The effects of Balethunder can be negated by Electrograna or being near [[Thunderwood]].
*'''[[Earth Kitsune Statue]]s''' are statues in the shape of a kitsune found on [[Narukami Island]]. They can be scanned using the [[Memento Lens]] gadget to reveal hidden mechanisms, objects, or dialogue.
[[File:Electrogranum.png|thumb|An Electrogranum]]
*'''[[Electrograna]]''' are [[Grana]] in Inazuma. After summoning them from a [[Thunder Sakura Bough]], the player can then solve a number of puzzles, have enhanced power in combat, or be protected from harmful environmental effects while exploring. The player can level up their Electrograna by increasing the [[Sacred Sakura's Favor]].
**'''[[Thunder Barrier]]s''' are barriers that can only be passed through while carrying an Electrogranum. They have varying strengths, with some requiring a higher-level Electrograna. They can also contain [[Thunderstone]]s, which deal damage to players not carrying Electrograna.

**'''[[Nimbus Gem]]s''' are objects that improve your combat capabilities when carrying an Electrogranum, found in various events, commissions, and challenges. Depending on how many the player is linked to, they can recharge the party's [[Energy]], increase [[Elemental Burst]] DMG, and create shockwaves.
**'''[[Thunder Dwelling]]s''' are objects that can be charged up using Electrograna to deal {{Color|Electro}} DMG to opponents.
*'''[[Electro Cube]]s''' are puzzles in the shape of a series of cubes. There are two types of Electro Cubes: ones that rotate and ones that light up when attacked. The rotation and lighting changes can affect adjacent cubes or a specific set of cubes, so attacking different cubes is required to solve the puzzle and obtain rewards.
[[File:Electro Current Puzzle.png|thumb|An Electro Current Puzzle]]
*'''[[Electro Current Puzzle]]s''' contain three types of stones which must be lined up to form a continuous current: '''Discharge Stones''', which shoot harmless electric currents; '''Relay Stones''', which repeat the current released by Discharge Stones; and '''Cumulation Stones''', which absorb electrical energy from the Discharge Stone. The Relay Stones, as well as items, characters, and enemies affected by {{Color|Electro}}, can be used to carry the current.

[[File:Tutorial Of Sun and Moon 1.png|thumb|The mechanism that allows the player to switch between Whitenight and Evernight]]
*'''Whitenight and Evernight''' are the two states in [[Enkanomiya]]. These two states are manually controlled by the player by adjusting the artificial sun, the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] found in the center of the region.
*'''[[Daises of Day and Night]]''' are mechanisims in Enkanomiya that appear different in the Whitenight and Evernight states. Get close to them to operate them. Their states will reset when switching between Evernight and Whitenight.
*'''[[Ghostfish]]''' are schools of fish in the air found in Enkanomiya. They will surround the player when they are within them, allowing them to continuously glide.
*'''[[Key Sigil]]s''' are items that have one of five different images on them found throughout Enkanomiya.
