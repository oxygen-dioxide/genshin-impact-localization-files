|description    = This settlement, which is based off [[Aaru Village]], comprises heavyset houses that fear neither erosion from sand nor the intrusion of uninvited wild beasts, for they have defensive strength equal to wooden structures. It is just that, or so you hear, the building materials are rather special, and thus the inner walls require regular maintenance on the part of those that inhabit such structures to check if they have begun to crack under long periods of weathering the searing wind and the burning sun, repairing them where necessary. Such work also helps to hone the perception of the inhabitants, making them more careful and precise about each aspect of their lives.
