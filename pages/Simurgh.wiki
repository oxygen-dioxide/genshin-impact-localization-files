'''Simurgh''' was a divine bird that helped combat the [[cataclysm]] alongside the [[Harvisptokhm]].

==Profile==
Simurgh was originally a shard of [[Khvarena]] that was formed from [[Nabu Malikata]], who then gave it to [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] so that she could protect it. Nabu Malikata foresaw the coming of the cataclysm and Simurgh's eventual sacrifice. After Nabu Malikata and [[King Deshret]] died, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata turned the Khvarena into a divine bird. She charged Simurgh with the "guardianship of the border between new birth and death." Simurgh slumbered until the disaster arrived. The [[Amrita Pool|Amrita]] is made of the remains of [[Egeria]], the previous [[Hydro Archon]], after she was slain during the upheaval, but it quickly began to be corrupted by the [[Abyss]]. In order to save the Amrita, Simurgh flew into the pool and shattered its form, becoming countless motes of Khvarena.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Vourukasha's Glow}}</ref> The sentient Khvarena became the [[Pari]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Khvarena's Light Shows}}</ref>
