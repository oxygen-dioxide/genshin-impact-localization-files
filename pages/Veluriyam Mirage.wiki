==Descriptions==
{{Description|A Domain hidden within a wondrous bottle. It is a beautiful and quiet place, and various special Hydro life-forms dwell within it...|[[Loading Screen]], Veluriyam Mirage}}
{{Description|This is a story that takes place within the confines of a little glass bottle. Rumor tells of a mysterious domain in the center of the desert, and it is said that those who enter shall be granted their heart's desire.<br><br>But who is to say whether there is any truth in this? Who knows if the fervor of countless travelers, filling this world inside a bottle to the very brim, is nothing but a mirage?|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/112174 "Secret Summer Paradise" Version 3.8 Update Details]}}

==Trivia==
* According to [[Idyia]], many of the buildings in this domain were redesigned by [[Kaveh]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Glaze Domain, Multum in Parvo}}</ref>
** Kaveh may have also inspired the character Miraculous Architect from the play Skycastle Saviors, which the Traveler and Paimon listen to in the [[Event Quest]] of the same name.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Skycastle Saviors}}</ref>
* Although it is supposedly located within [[Sumeru]], [[Nahida]]'s talent [[On All Things Meditated]] cannot be used to read the thoughts of any of the characters present in this area.
* Although characters in the story refer to this location as a [[Domain]], the game does not consider it as such, as access to all of the game's standard functions is still enabled, unlike in actual Domains where many are disabled. The Mirage area itself even contains locations that the game does consider as Domains gameplay-wise, such as the big tent accessed during [[Fairground Gathering, Summer Lights Illuminated]].

===Etymology===
* Veluriyam likely derives from a form of the Pali word ''{{wt|veḷuriya}}'' (meaning {{w|lapis lazuli}}, a precious blue stone).
