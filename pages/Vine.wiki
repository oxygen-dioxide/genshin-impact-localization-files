'''Vines''' ''(unofficial name)'' are objects found in [[Teyvat]]. They sometimes spawn around [[Ley Line Outcrops]]. When touched, they deal '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}. When hit by a {{Pyro}} attack, they will burn down.

Dendro Vines may also appear around [[Chests]], in which case they must be burned down in order for the chest to be opened. Even though these also appear thorny, touching this type of vines will not deal damage.

While [[Elemental Sight]] is active, Dendro Vines will be Colored green. However, Dendro Vines summoned via Samachurl will not be Colored {{Color|Dendro|green}} while Elemental Sight is active.
