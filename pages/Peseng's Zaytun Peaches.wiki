==Steps==
# Give ten Zaytun Peaches to Peseng

==Request Details==
Help Needed:<br />
We're running out of Zaytun Peaches at home for making meals, and my wife has asked me to go buy some.<br />
Still, going to buy the stuff is a massive bother, so could someone just pluck a few {{Color|buzzword|Zaytun Peaches}} for me?<br />
{{Color|buzzword|10}} of them will do just fine.
