|description = An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br>This cat is intelligent and combative, and has quite the aura of prestige to it. These cats are excellent at earning the favor of humans, and it is often able to get the upper hand over its kin when it comes to gathering food. As such, they tend to get fat quite quickly, though this does not diminish their cuteness in human eyes at all.
