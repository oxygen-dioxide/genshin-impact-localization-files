|description    = A mask with colors reminiscent of a [[Yumkasaurus]] that can be found for sale at stalls in the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]'s [[Chuwen Fair]]. It is said that the grappling devices widely used today by the people of [[Natlan]] were inspired by the manner in which Yumkasaurs climb. As such, some stories associate Yumkasaur Masks with resourcefulness and intelligence.
