:'''Zhenchen:''' Found the animals?
:{{DIcon}} Yup.
::'''Zhenchen:''' Haha, then you must have received the gifts and letters prepared by our adopters, yes?
::'''Zhenchen:''' These adopters really are full of enthusiasm. They even approached us to offer their support after hearing about our plans.
::'''Zhenchen:''' I'm sure they'll be glad to receive your gift in return.
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
::'''Lamiya:''' The imaging signal from the Inscribed Mirror is clear enough, but some work will be required to analyze the environmental images.
::'''Lamiya:''' These animals aren't active over a wide area, so let's remain patient and have a look around.
