==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Parisa:''' If you ask me, everyone should watch a show at Zubayr Theater!
:{{DIcon}} About the Zubayr Theater...
::'''Parisa:''' In the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Sumeru City]], there is Zubayr Theater, full of song and dance.
::'''Parisa:''' The manager [[Sheikh Zubayr]] is a real genius! He knows playwriting and choreography, and even makes props. He excels in everything!
::'''Parisa:''' The beautiful dancer [[Nilou]] performs even better than ever with the choreography of Sheikh Zubayr.
::'''Parisa:''' You may consider yourself lucky if you ever get to see her dance at the [[Sabzeruz Festival]]!
::{{DIcon}} About the Sabzeruz Festival...
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::'''Parisa:''' Sabzeruz Festival is the festival celebrating the birthday of Sumeru's deity ― the Dendro Archon.
:::'''Parisa:''' After [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] passed away, Sabzeruz Festival was moved to the birthday of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. Unfortunately, the festival lost some of its former glory in the process...
:::'''Parisa:''' The [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] no longer hosts the festival, and we practically have little chance to see the Dance of Sabzeruz.
:::'''Parisa:''' What a pity...
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Parisa:''' The Sabzeruz Festival is the festival celebrating the birthday of Sumeru's deity ― the Dendro Archon.
:::'''Parisa:''' It is said that in the ancient past, the [[Goddess of Flowers]] would dance at the Dendro Archon's birthday, and the [[Padisarah]]s would bloom across the stage...
:::'''Parisa:''' Thus, we call the Dendro Archon's birthday celebration the "Sabzeruz Festival."
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself...
::'''Parisa:''' I'm just the most ordinary traveling scholar at the Akademiya. I'm nobody.
::'''Parisa:''' If I had a gift for art, I probably wouldn't have gone to the Akademiya. Just a joke, haha.
::'''Parisa:''' There seems to be very few people at the Akademiya who have a thing for singing and dancing. Perhaps research and papers take up most of their time.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Studying is important.
:::'''Parisa:''' True. With knowledge, you can live a better life.
:::'''Parisa:''' But we shouldn't be rigid in our studies. Only with a flexible mind can we unravel greater mysteries.
::;(Obtain [[Guide to Ingenuity]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Parisa:''' Goodbye. Make sure you see Nilou's dance performance at Grand Bazaar!
