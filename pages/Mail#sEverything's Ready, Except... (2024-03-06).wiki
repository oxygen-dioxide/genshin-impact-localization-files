|text      = When I was reading the newspaper to Master, I saw your amazing achievements in other places. I'm really happy for you, but also worried you'll miss Liyue food. I was going to ask Master for a vacation and bring [[Qiqi]] to see you, but after Aunty [[Xianyun|Cloud Retainer]] found out, she said we should just invite everyone to celebrate together. She called [[Ganyu]] and [[Shenhe]] over in a flash, I invited Qiqi, and we all had a great time together!

Right! I even asked [[Xiangling]] to help me prepare a whole bunch of Liyue dishes! Even Master said they smelled just like they should, you know! You should hurry on over and have a taste while they're still hot, and then tell me some of your adventuring stories! After all, "knowledge read is secondhand at best," right?
