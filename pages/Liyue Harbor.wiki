==Descriptions==
{{Description|A prosperous port city where a thousand ships drop anchor. Under the aegis of countless contracts and regulations, innumerable goods change hands and grace the seven nations with their presence. Welcome to Liyue, wayfaring Traveler.|Viewpoint, [[Where Merchants Flock And All Ships Dock]]}}
{{Description|The establishment of the harbor kicked off Liyue's seafaring trade. As Teyvat's largest market harbor, the sheer amount of goods that flow to and from it is simply incomparable for other ports.<br />Every year during the [[Lantern Rite]] you can see thousands of lanterns ascend into the night sky — a Liyue event that you can't afford to miss.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}

==Trivia==
* At the southeastern wharf of Liyue Harbor, either a large ship with four sails or a smaller ship with two sails appear randomly (regardless of day and time). Sometimes neither appear.
** Two Common Chests can be found aboard the large ship, one at each end.
