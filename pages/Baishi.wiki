==Trivia==
* In Chinese, Baishi's name translates to "Hundred-Knowing" {{Lang|zh=百识}}. She shares a similar name with her two fellow secretaries, [[Baiwen]] {{Lang|zh=百闻|zh_tl=Hundred-Hearing}} and [[Baixiao]] {{Lang|zh=百晓|zh_tl=Hundred-Understanding}}. The names may collectively be a reference to Ningguang's renowned insight into the inner workings of Liyue Harbor<ref>{{Ref/CS|Ningguang|2}}</ref>.
