"'''Descender'''" is a term used by the [[Fatui]] for outlanders who do not originate from the world of [[Teyvat]] but come to live within it. The [[Traveler]] is the fourth person the Fatui have labeled as a Descender, and [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] presumes that the entity known as the [[Heavenly Principles]] is the first.<ref name="C3A5">{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref>

==Overview==
Descenders are not bound to the world's laws and are thus unaffected by circumstances that affect beings from this world. Furthermore, information and memories about them are not recorded in [[Irminsul]], which only collects information about Teyvat. Conversely, their memories are not changed when Irminsul is tampered with. For example, only the Traveler remembers [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] after all traces of her existence were erased from Irminsul and thus, from history and memory itself.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref> This change affected non-sentient items such as books, and even in-game descriptions such as [[Nahida]]'s Character Stories.

After [[Scaramouche]] erased himself from Irminsul, the Traveler<ref name="Night-Bird">{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref> and [[Alice]]<ref name="Wanderer Misc">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/12SZu2t6Ak8 Collected Miscellany - "Wanderer: Any Way the Wind Blows"]</ref> were able to retain their knowledge of him. Nahida, despite being affected by Irminsul, managed to recover her memories of him by hiding his story deep within an allegorical fairy tale that was able to remain unaffected by Irminsul tampering, then corroborating the story with the Traveler's account of him.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref>

Notably, the Fatui did not classify the [[Traveler's Sibling]] as a Descender and despite supposedly coming from the sea of stars, their travels throughout Teyvat following the fall of [[Khaenri'ah]] have been recorded in Irminsul. Lesser Lord Kusanali believes this indicates that their sibling originates from Teyvat despite the discrepancy with the Traveler's memories. The Traveler suspects that this means there is either something wrong with their own memories, or that "this world" has done something to their sibling.<ref name="C3A5" /> Scaramouche also divulges that the Sibling "only came to this world because the heavens responded to the summoning," and that their differences from the Traveler may relate to Khaenri'ah, which is something he learned from [[Pierro]].<ref name="Night-Bird" />

==Trivia==
* Based on other ''Genshin Impact'' lore, the following characters may be classified as Descenders:
** According to the book ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', the [[Primordial One]] (suspected to be [[Phanes]]) descended on this world, defeated the [[Seven Sovereigns]], and remade the world with the help of its four shades.
** Later, an entity or group of entities referred to as the [[Second Who Came]] (or second throne of the heavens)<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|title=Before Sun and Moon}}</ref> descended on the firmament and waged war against the Primordial One.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref>
** [[Alice]] is an "unaging,"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The_Golden_Apple_Vacation_Returns!_(Quest)}}</ref><ref group="Note">Given that Venti narrated his encounter with Alice and Klee as if it were a two-line story, it is unclear if Venti meant "unaging" in a literal sense or if he used the word for illustrative purposes.</ref> nigh-omnipotent witch capable of traveling to, and bringing back mementos from, other worlds,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Barbara|Alice's Idol Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Heavenly Stone's Debris|note=Zhiqiong quotes Alice's reference to the {{w|Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon}}.}}</ref> with a certain "job" related to her duty of guarding Teyvat's "borders."<ref>{{Ref/Item|Wings of Feasting}}</ref> She has also served as a replacement [[Alice#Gallery|narrator for Collected Miscellanies]], with the implication that "Bough Keeper" [[Dainsleif]], the usual narrator for Collected Miscellanies, cannot provide relevant information about the characters whom Alice introduces.
*** However, it is possible that Alice's Descender-like qualities relate to her job, which allows her to "see this world and everything that lives in it [f]rom a lot of different perspectives" and also grants her "special privileges" which she mentions in the context of Teyvat's "rules" but does not elaborate on.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/12SZu2t6Ak8 Collected Miscellany - "Wanderer: Any Way the Wind Blows"]</ref>
* While [[Aloy]] is technically from another world and her [[Collected Miscellany]] calls her the first outlander Alice has seen "in centuries,"<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/bx2aWuUjxnE Collected Miscellany - "Aloy: Mystical Glow of Frost"]</ref> as a collaboration character, she has not been integrated into the ''Genshin Impact'' storyline. As such, whether or not she would be classified as a Descender will likely not be addressed.
