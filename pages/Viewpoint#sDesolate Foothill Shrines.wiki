|text    = In the tales told by older folks, the ancestral peoples of Chenyu Vale migrated here from the [[The Chasm (Area)|far south]], and they built a mighty ritual tower to touch the heavens and left many mighty temples. The jade tower is no more, and only silent, ancient ruins stand amidst the thick fog that shrouds the mountains, watching over a secret none now shall know.
