{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Maruf:''' Hmm, we don't have many bandages left... I should probably inform the village head the next time I see him.
:{{DIcon}} You're...?
::'''Maruf:''' I'm the best doctor in Aaru Village &mdash; that is to say, the only doctor in Aaru Village.
::'''Maruf:''' Though I'd say that my greatest specialty is bandaging wounds.
::'''Maruf:''' People who get injured out in the desert often wind up here in the village, and they rely on me to treat their wounds.
::'''Maruf:''' Though Aaru Village consists of mostly children and the elderly, most of them are in good health and rarely get afflicted with any serious illnesses.
::'''Maruf:''' As for minor ailments, I just give out medicine based on previous experience, and everything usually turns out fine.
::{{DIcon}} What if it's a serious illness then?
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::'''Maruf:''' Do you mean diseases as terrible as Eleazar?
:::'''Maruf:''' I'm afraid that in such cases, even the researchers of Sumeru City might be of little help. The only thing they can do is leave it up to fate.
:::'''Maruf:''' Of course, such cases would be very extreme ones.
:::'''Maruf:''' If anything beyond my control crops up... Then all I can do is to attempt to have them sent to the city.
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::{{DIcon}} What happens in the case of very serious illnesses, then?
:::'''Maruf:''' Well, if something else comes up that's clearly beyond my abilities... then I can only attempt to send them to the city.
:::'''Maruf:''' Well, Lesser Lord Kusanali was able to cure something as awful as Eleazar, so I reckon the Bimarstan under her Akademiya must be pretty good, too!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Maruf:''' See you. May you remain in good health.
