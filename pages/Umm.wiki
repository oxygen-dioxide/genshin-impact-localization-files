:'''Umm:''' Greetings, welcome to [[Gandharva Ville]].
:'''Umm:''' Life is comfortable here, right? It's much better than the city!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself...
::'''Umm:''' I'm the longest living resident here... One of them anyway. Perhaps only [[Keon]], who's a few years my elder, can compete with me.
::'''Umm:''' It was a blessing in disguise, this carefree life in the forest.
::'''Umm:''' I was a researcher of the [[Akademiya]] in my youth, but I was caught up in vicious academic competition.
::'''Umm:''' Hmph! I didn't want to fight with those unethical researchers. A secluded life in the forest was way better.
::'''Umm:''' It was at here where I realized that knowledge, power, and wealth are the source of our troubles, and that a simple life is the best life.
::'''Umm:''' Those youngsters from the Akademiya should learn the [[Forest Rangers]]' way of life!
::{{DIcon}} Forest Rangers are civil servants too...
::'''Umm:''' ...You can't just group them up together because they are all civil servants!
::'''Umm:''' Let me explain... It's like how... the [[Lesser Lord Kusanali|Dendro Archon]] and the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Greater Lord]] are incomparable to each other. Do you get it now?
::'''Umm:''' Instead of asking me more questions, why don't you just stay a few days? I'm certain you'll get to know the simplicity and beauty of forest life.
:{{DIcon}} Do you not like the city?
::'''Umm:''' What's so great about the city? Its atmosphere always feels weird to me.
::'''Umm:''' No matter how tall the buildings that are built leaning against the [[Divine Tree]] are, we seem to draw no closer to the gods.
::'''Umm:''' Otherwise, why would researchers who so desperately yearn for knowledge come to [[Avidya Forest]] to gain success?
::'''Umm:''' ...Not that I'm saying that knowledge is that good, but you should understand what I mean, right?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Umm:''' You're leaving already? *sigh* You still haven't understood the true meaning of a carefree life, I see.
