|description     = A pizza made using Grainfruit. 
|desc_suspicious = The combination of sweet Grainfruit and salty cheese can make for a romantic encounter but also an irreconcilable clash... Unfortunately, the flavor on this one appears to be the latter.
|desc_basic      = Grainfruit is scattered across the crust before a thick layer of cheese is poured on top, and the whole thing is delivered into the oven. The final touch is to then draw a little Koholasaurus picture on it. Eat it while it's hot — the warmth will remind you of a serene time spent enjoying a soothing soak in a hot spring.
|desc_delicious  = The cheese pull is like a golden waterfall, descending into your mouth bedecked in juicy Grainfruit. The sweetness and saltiness blend on your tongue, luring forth a boundless appetite within you — even when you finish the whole thing, you could go for more.
