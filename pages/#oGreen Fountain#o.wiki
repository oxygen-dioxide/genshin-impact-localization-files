|description    = A plant with especially verdant foliage found all over [[Teyvat]].<br />Legend says its roots run especially deep, allowing it to draw water from far below the surface and get rid of harmful substances, and also making it a natural reservoir of water. For this reason, adventurers who often mash up the leaves to extract drinking water have given it the name "Green Fountain."<br />Branch Master [[Cyrus]], however, cautions the younger generation against simply chewing the leaves, as they are bitter, spicy, and may harm the throat.
