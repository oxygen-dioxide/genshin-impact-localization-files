;Other Additions
* New [[Book]]s:
** [[Time Trekker]]
* New Function: Fast Equip [[Artifact]]s
** Quick Configuration: A set of Artifacts will be put together for your reference based on data from recently active players. When generating a configuration, it will only consider Artifacts not already equipped by other characters.
** Custom Configuration: Custom Configuration data will be based on the settings laid out for each character. When using a Custom Configuration, you can configure based on conditions such as Artifact Main Affix, Set Type, and Minor Affixes and choose whether or not to use Artifacts that haven't already been equipped. The configuration created by Custom Configuration can be adjusted, with alternative Artifacts sorted based on the overall priority levels of their Artifact Set and Affixes. When "Other Options" > "All" is selected in Custom Configuration, when the configuration includes Artifacts already equipped by another character, the Artifacts will be removed and equipped to the target character.

* Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 4.4, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:
** Phase I: Ascendant Moon
*** When a character receives healing, it will be counted. When the count reaches a total of 16, a shockwave will be unleashed at the character's position, dealing True DMG to nearby opponents and clearing the count. 1 such shockwave can be unleashed every 8s.
** Phase II: Resilient Moon
*** After the active character's Plunging Attacks hit opponents, the character's Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 20% for 8s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Max 3 stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently. This effect will be cleared if the character leaves the field.
** Phase III: Plummeting Moon
*** After the active character's Plunging Attacks hit opponents, unleash a shockwave at the character's location, dealing True DMG to nearby opponents. 1 such shockwave can be unleashed every 2s.

** The adjusted description is: "When your Dvalin, who has this card equipped, is on the field, when Total Collapse attached to an opposing character is removed: Apply Total Collapse to the next opposing standby character."

;System

* Renames "Fullscreen" in "Display Mode" to "Borderless" in the "[[Settings]] / Graphics" interface in the Irminsul Server on PC (actual display effect remains unchanged; after said adjustment, available options in "Display Mode" in the Irminsul Server on PC are "Borderless" and "Windowed").
* Adds a red notification dot in the "[[Adventurer Handbook]] > Commissions" interface to remind Travelers to go to the [[Adventurers' Guild]] and claim Bonus Rewards after obtaining all 4 [[Daily Commission]] Rewards every day.

;Other

On PCs that support this feature, you will be able to find and enable "Dynamic Character Resolution" in Settings > Graphics (this option will not be shown on PCs that currently do not support it).
* The text descriptions of some achievements have been fixed (the corresponding Achievement Trophies on PlayStation® cannot be modified currently).
* After the Version 4.4 update, new [[UID]] naming rules will be used for newly registered accounts on the Asia server (existing account UIDs will be unaffected).

* Adjust the effect of the Event Card "[[In Every House a Stove]]" to the following: Draw a number of cards equal to the current Round number minus 1. (Up to 4 cards can be drawn in this way).
* Adjusts the effect of the Equipment Card "[[Vourukasha's Glow (Equipment Card)|Vourukasha's Glow]]": Only after triggering its "draw 1 card" effect, its other effect "heal the attached character for 1 HP" can take effect in that same Round.
* Adjusts the effect of the status "Lightning Rod" for the Character Card "[[Thunder Manifestation (Character Card)|Thunder Manifestation]]": The effect "While this status is active, can be triggered once: DMG received by the attached character from Thunder Manifestation or its summons is increased by 1." has been adjusted to "When the attached character takes DMG from Thunder Manifestation or its summons: Remove this state, cause this DMG instance to increase by 1."

* Fixes an issue whereby when [[Lyney]] approached opponents after turning into a Grin-Malkin Cat with his Elemental Burst, there was a small chance that he would deal an additional instance of DMG to the same opponent.

;System
* Fixes an issue in the "[[Adventurer Handbook]] > Commissions" interface whereby despite still lacking an extremely tiny amount of Encounter Points, it would suggest there were already enough to claim the rewards.

* Fixes an issue with the Character Card "[[Layla (Character Card)|Layla]]" whereby the Combat Status "Curtain of Slumber Shield" created by her Elemental Skill lacked the "Shield" tag.
* Fixes an issue during challenges whereby, when cards imbued with either Pneuma or Ousia energy became Deactivated after casting skills that needed to be prepared, the statuses of these skills would abnormally remain.
* Fixes an issue whereby, when the Character Card "[[Alhaitham (Character Card)|Alhaitham]]" had the Status "Chisel-Light Mirror" attached, the text description for the character's Normal Attack abnormally failed to state that DMG inflicted would be Dendro DMG (this was purely a textual error as the actual effect was working properly).

;Audio
* Fixes an issue whereby there would be abnormal background noises when enhancing Artifacts.
* Fixes grammar mistakes and errors with the Chinese voice-overs for certain characters and quests.
