==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Matsumoto:''' Yo, hey there!
:'''Matsumoto:''' Are you here to ask me to rate your dishes? Don't you disappoint me again.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Matsumoto:''' I'm Matsumoto, the traveling food critic. Recently, I've found myself in a dilemma of having no dishes to try out.
::'''Matsumoto:''' I have already finished going through every single restaurant on this street. Whether it's [[Uyuu Restaurant]] or [[Kiminami Restaurant]], there is nothing new around here.
::'''Matsumoto:''' With my years of experience as a food critic, I'd rate these joints as "mediocre."
::'''Matsumoto:''' I have tasted every single bizarre gourmet dish there is, but I find that there is more authenticity in simple and plain things.
::'''Matsumoto:''' If you asked me what the tastiest thing in this world is... I would say it must be the lemon drink with unlimited refill from Kiminami Restaurant.
:{{DIcon}} A food critic?
::'''Matsumoto:''' Yes, as a food critic, I will definitely give every dish you serve the fairest of comments.
::'''Matsumoto:''' So, what would you like me to try? Please bring it to me.
::{{DIcon}} Bring it to you...?
:::'''Matsumoto:''' Yes, that's right. What's the matter?
:::'''Matsumoto:''' You're asking me to taste the food, so obviously you should be the one who pays or makes it for me.
:::'''Matsumoto:''' It would be difficult to be objective if you asked me to pay for the food. The price of the dish would affect the result.
:::'''Matsumoto:''' Only through a trade with no exchange of money can there be a fair review.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} What kind of dishes are you looking for?
:::'''Matsumoto:''' Simpler dishes do a better job at revealing the chef's true mastery over the culinary arts.
:::'''Matsumoto:''' For example, these Egg Rolls from the [[Kiminami Restaurant]]. This dish needs to be at least of this level for it to be worthy of my critique.
:::'''Matsumoto:''' If you can't make something of this level, then I suggest you give up, as you are only wasting my time.
::;(Obtain [[Egg Roll]]s ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Matsumoto:''' Goodbye. *sigh* Guess it's just lemon water for me again...
