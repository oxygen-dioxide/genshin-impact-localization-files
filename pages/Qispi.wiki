:'''Qispi:''' One, two... Mmm, three...
:'''Qispi:''' Hmm, hmm... One, two...
:'''Paimon:''' Sound, sound the weirdo alarm!
:'''Qispi:''' Ah, if you ask me, the only weirdo's around here are you outlanders... Ho... hoho... This sure isn't the type of place you'd expect to see outlanders...
:'''Paimon:''' Is this some kind of... forbidden place? Or Scared place?
:'''Qispi:''' Nope, just some place I discovered, completely by chance... a place of buried treasure. Mmm, well come on then you two, huddle up. Can you hear it? This very special rock before you... this is... the "Treasure Stone"...
:'''Qispi:''' The low humming noise it makes rises and falls, almost like... the sound of breathing.
:{{DIcon}} "Hard" life being a rock, huh?
:{{DIcon}} I'm good at brething too
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, what's so amazing about being able to breathe... Wait, why are we even talking about this?
:'''Paimon:''' A rock... can breathe?
:'''Qispi:''' Yes, and not only that... If you press your ear against it, you can hear a beat too... even the sound of rock grinding against rock beneath its coarse surface...
:'''Qispi:''' Hehe... hoho... Such wonderful sounds.
:'''Qispi:''' Abd, abd... If you feed it small rocks, it'll give you even better, shinier rocks in return...
:'''Qispi:''' Aaaah, simply incredible, is it not> Look at these gemstones... look! One, two...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's what you were doing when we came over just now, counting gems...
:'''Qispi:''' Yes, and I can tell that after gobbling up all these rock, the Treasure Stone has become even stronger, even more powerful than before...
:'''Qispi:''' This must be... a miracle! Ah, my Treasure Stone... my precious...
:{{DIcon}} For real? Why does it sound like some kind of scam...
:{{DIcon}} {{Tx}}
:'''Qispi:''' Heh, hehe.... I never expected outsiders like you to believe me. Nobody would believe it... before they'd tried it themselves.
:'''Qispi:''' I myself disocered it by pure chance after placing some ore that I'd collected on the Treasure Stone's edge...
:'''Qispi:''' Speaking of which... Why don't you give it a try? Seeing is believing, after alll!
:'''Qispi:''' It just so happens that it's already eaten all the rocks around here though. I need to find some new ones... but I can't go looking myself...
:'''Paimon:'''Umm... Why not?
:'''Qispi:''' Well of course. someone has to stay here and look after the Treasure Stone, don't they? C-can you imagine what would happen if it went into hidding underground while I was away... What would I do then!?
:'''Qispi:''' I've stood guard here for such a long time now... all the rocks I has on me. I've already fed them to the Stone...
:'''Qispi:''' G-go, find me some new ones, and I'll prove it. I'll f-feed them to it before your very eyes!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, sounds like a classic con-artist's pitch...
:'''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Wanna give it a try?
:'''Qispi:''' What's up? Hehe, just like i said before... You go find some rocks, hand them over to me, and I'll feed them to the Treasre Stone. I guarantee you it'll make some even better ones...
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Submit 5 Iron chunk or White iron chunk
:'''Qispi:''' Mmm... I'll feed these to the Treasure Stone once things have quieted down...
:'''Qispi:''' Just give it some time, hehe, and it'll produce some even better rocks... Hehe... One,two...
;(Interacting again)
:'''Qispi:''' Mmmm... Patience, patience is the key. When things have quietened down. I'll feed these to the Treasure Stone...
:'''Qispi:''' Just give it some time, hehe, and it'll produce some even better rocks... Hehe... One,two...
;(After server reset. Next day)
