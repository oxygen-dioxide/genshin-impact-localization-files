{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pacha:''' If only I could make friends with the Riders of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]], or their fluffy Qucusaurs...
:{{DIcon}} If you want it, then work for it.
::'''Pacha:''' Haha, that's true, but as we all know, most members of the Flower-Feather Clan enjoy flying in the sky on their Qucusaurus friends.
::'''Pacha:''' It's hard enough to see one on the ground, much less set up a meeting.
::'''Pacha:''' Hmm... But now that I think about it, both the Scions of the Canopy and the Flower-Feather Clan like high places, and have a pretty good relationship with one another...
::'''Pacha:''' Which means, I shouldn't give up just yet!
::'''Pacha:''' Mhm, it's a good thing that I'm not afraid of heights. Next time, I'll try my luck with a hot-air balloon and go even further up.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Heading for the high ground.
::'''Pacha:''' Oho, well said.
::'''Pacha:''' To continually challenge yourself is also a way to compete with your past self.

:{{DIcon}} Haven't you made any friends yet?
:;(Available after completing ''[[No One Fights Alone]]''){{Verify}}
::'''Pacha:''' Haha, it's not that easy!
::'''Pacha:''' I did come across some of the Flower-Feather Clan's warriors on the battlefield, but that was hardly the time for a chit-chat.
::'''Pacha:''' Those Qucusaurs flew up so high! If the Flower-Feather Clan hadn't done such a good job saving people left, right, and center, there might have been even more casualties.
::'''Pacha:''' I don't think I'd be able to fight alongside them... not with my abilities, at least. Perhaps the most experienced hunters could jump as high as they can.
::'''Pacha:''' But with greater abilities comes greater risk too... I still haven't heard any news of [[Sinchi]] since the war ended...
:{{DIcon}} Good luck.
::'''Pacha:''' Yeah, thank you for that, it means a lot.
