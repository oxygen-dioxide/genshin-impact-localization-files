==Trivia==
* The level names of this domain are "Thunderclouds" for [[Guyun Pillars]], "Thundering Ruins" for [[Elixirs]], and "Trial Grounds of Thunder" for [[Aerosiderite]]. All of the lightning-related names likely refer to the Ley Line Disorder that inflicts an Electro-related effect on you and drops lightning from above and also how all the enemies are Electro-based.
*{{Lang|"{{w|Guicang}}"|zh=归藏|zh_tl=Return to the Hidden}}, {{Lang|"{{w|zh:連山易|Lianshan}}"|zh=连山}}, and {{Lang|"{{w|Zhou Yi}}"|zh=周易|zh_tl=Changes of Zhou}} were three independent ancient Chinese arts of divination collectively known as the {{Lang|"Three Changes"|zh=三易|zh_rm=Sānyì}}. These names are the basis for the three "Hidden Palace of [Name] Formula" domains: [[Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula]], Hidden Palace of Lianshan Formula, and [[Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula]].
* It is said that the [[Eight Adepts|Two Sages of Lianshan]] once used this domain as a place of cultivation.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Liyue Celebrates and Eight Adepts Face a Hidden Calamity}}</ref>
