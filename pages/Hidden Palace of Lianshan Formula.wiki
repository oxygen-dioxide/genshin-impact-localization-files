==Trivia==
* The level names of this domain are "Thunderclouds" for [[Guyun Pillars]], "Thundering Ruins" for [[Elixirs]], and "Trial Grounds of Thunder" for [[Aerosiderite]]. All of the lightning-related names likely refer to the Ley Line Disorder that inflicts an Electro-related effect on you and drops lightning from above and also how all the enemies are Electro-based.
*The name Lianshan refers to the ancient Chinese art of divination {{Lang|"Lianshan"|zh=连山}}, one of the {{Lang|"Three Changes"|zh=三易|zh_rm=Sānyì}}. The other two are {{Lang|"Guicang"|zh=归藏}} and {{Lang|"Zhou Yi"|zh=周易}}, correlating to the other two [[Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula|Hidden Palace]] [[Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula|Formula Domains]].
