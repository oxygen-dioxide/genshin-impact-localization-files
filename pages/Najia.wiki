==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Najia:''' Hello. It isn't showtime right now, and it's messy around here. Please mind your head and feet.
:{{DIcon}} And you are... 
:;(Available before completing ''[[To the Wise]]'')
::'''Najia:''' I'm a prop engineer for Zubayr Theater. Other than designing and making props, I also maintain the venue.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing? 
:;(Available after completing ''To the Wise'')
::'''Najia:''' *sigh* I was halfway through working on my props when I realized that the stage needs maintenance again, and that we need to finish those safety checks before the next performance lest we put our actors at risk.
::{{DIcon}} How's work?
::'''Najia:''' Mr. Zubayr is very strict about every aspect of a performance, so I always worry that I'm not good enough...
::'''Najia:''' Are the props attractive enough? Is every detail the best it can be? Do the mechanisms operate smoothly? I think hard about these things daily.
::'''Najia:''' Sometimes, it's enough for me to get the urge to join [[Kshahrewar]]. Some Kshahrewar regulars are on good terms with me as well...
::'''Najia:''' But then I'd give that up. It's not as if I was building a real palace or anything.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Rest assured.
:::'''Najia:''' If only I could be as open-minded as you are.
:::'''Najia:''' Maybe it all comes down to the fact that I'm so attached to this theater, and that I have certain demands on myself.
:::'''Najia:''' Anyway, thank you for comforting me. Here are some leftover rocks from what we made props with. They are quality rocks. Please take them.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Crystal Chunk|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the notice!
::'''Najia:''' You're welcome.
