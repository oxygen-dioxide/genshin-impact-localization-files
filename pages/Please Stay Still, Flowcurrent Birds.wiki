;(Approach Jonvelle)
:'''???:''' *sigh* How long is all this preparation going to take? Agh, maybe I'll have to... try something different...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}, look over there! Someone sighing away by the seaside... and there's a [[Kamera]] too...

;(Get closer to Jonvelle)
:'''???:''' *sigh* It ran off again. Agh, there's only one left inside the swim ring... What do we do now...
:'''???:''' How long is this going to take...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, looks like someone's taking pictures... of the Flowcurrent Birds here?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, they are pretty cute...
:{{DIcon}} What with how they sway this way and that...
::'''Paimon:''' Right? They're so cute, bobbing about as they walk. And when they puff up into a ball and float on the water... Ah, that just makes Paimon feel happy.
:{{DIcon}} I prefer [[Flying Squirrel]]s, to be honest...
::'''Paimon:''' Well, they're cute too, but could you really bear to say "Flying Squirrels are cuter" right in front of a swimming Flowcurrent Bird's face?
:'''???:''' That's the spirit, my lovely young lady with the beautifully shiny silver hair! Truly, the one who created these Flowcurrent Birds deserves all the praise this world can offer...
:'''Jonvelle:''' So great is... Ah, wait, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm a Flowcurrent Bird photography enthusiast. Call me Jonvelle.
:'''Paimon:''' Sure! My name's Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}... Still, why are you sighing sadly over here? Aren't there tons of Flowcurrent Birds around you?
:'''Jonvelle:''' That's... a long story, but allow me to summarize. There are many just like me, and all of us want to take the most interesting photos...
:'''Jonvelle:''' And just a few days ago, I came up with an idea most ingenious... That is, to put all the Flowcurrent Birds within my Kamera frame into swim rings!
:{{DIcon}} And what might be the meaning in that, exactly?
::'''Jonvelle:''' The meaning, of course, is that it is utterly meaningless. Flowcurrent Birds can swim, and as such, to have them wear those swim rings...
::'''Jonvelle:''' ...Is a thing as devoid of meaning as spending Mora to earn the same amount of Mora back!
:{{DIcon}} Indeed, this is hardly something a normal person would have considered...
::'''Jonvelle:''' When Flowcurrent Birds, who can float on water by themselves, wear swim rings, this will create an overflow of layered meaning within the photo.
::'''Jonvelle:''' Thus, sufficiently embodying both the themes of "overuse" and "waste"...
:'''Paimon:''' Feels like you're putting too much on their shoulders...
:'''Jonvelle:''' Indeed, that is what they call "surrealist photography" &mdash; one must seek deeper meaning within the photo one takes... Though, unfortunately we've run into some trouble on that front.
:'''Jonvelle:''' As one might expect, real Flowcurrent Birds don't wear swim rings, and so one cannot, in fact, take such pictures...
:{{DIcon}} You did call it "surreal," you know...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait. We could just put the swim rings on all the Flowcurrent Birds, couldn't we? C'mon, {{Traveler}}. Let's lend a hand, from two Flowcurrent Bird enthusiasts to another!
:{{DIcon}} Woohoo, yes, jolly enthusiast cooperation!
::'''Paimon:''' Ex-actly!
:{{DIcon}} I prefer Flying Squirrels though...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, now's not the time for that sort of talk!
:'''Jonvelle:''' Wait, really? You'd help me out?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, as long as you give us a few nice pictures once you're done!
:'''Jonvelle:''' W&mdash;Well then, I'd be in your debt!

;(Talk to Jovelle again, optional)
:'''Jonvelle:''' I'll hit the shutter the instant that is done, sure as I'm a Flowcurrent Bird photography enthusiast! Well, not that a title like that inspires much confidence...

;(Talk to Jonvelle a second time, optional)
:'''Jonvelle:''' All that needs doing is for a swim ring to be put over each of the Flowcurrent Birds within the Kamera frame...

;(If a Flowcurrent Bird is hit)
:{{Black Screen|Looks like some Flowcurrent Birds have drifted off...<br>You'll have to wait for them to return and try again...}}

;(Upon capturing a Flowcurrent Bird)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, gotcha!

;(Upon capturing a Flowcurrent Bird behind an obstacle)
:'''Jonvelle:''' Well, though you did catch the Flowcurrent Bird, I won't be able to capture it from this angle...

;(Upon capturing two Flowcurrent Birds in one ring)
:'''Jonvelle:''' Ah, so that's it... Yeah, you can put both into the same one!

;(After capturing all three Flowcurrent Birds)
:'''Jonvelle:''' Ah, such lovely timing...
:'''Jonvelle:''' I can barely believe that my photo-taking quest, which had eluded me no matter how hard I tried, was completed so quickly with your help...
:'''Jonvelle:''' All these Flowcurrent Birds, their bobbing, rolling forms sitting within their swim rings! A sight so moving as to bring one to tears...
:{{DIcon}} Is it really that moving...
:'''Jonvelle:''' Sometimes, we make our life's pursuit out of something that others cannot understand &mdash; indeed, even consider absurd.
:'''Jonvelle:''' Nonetheless, I believe that the number of Flowcurrent Bird enthusiasts in the world shall increase, so long as I keep taking these photos!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon one hundred percent believes in this future too!
:'''Jonvelle:''' Ah, thank you both so much for your help! Please, take these as tokens of my gratitude!
