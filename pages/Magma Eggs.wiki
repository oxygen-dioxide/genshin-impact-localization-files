|desc_basic      = A jet-black egg, formed by absorbing the essence of flame and rock. Despite its obsidian appearance, it tastes just like a regular boiled egg — unless, of course, one were to go out of their way to cook it in an irregular fashion...
|desc_delicious  = A jet-black egg, with a beautiful frosty sheen observable in its darkness. Like a chunk of black jade slumbering in the mist, it's no wonder there are rumors about how it can prolong one's lifespan. That said, one can only hope it doesn't have the opposite effect...

'''Magma Eggs''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The [[recipe]] for Magma Eggs is obtainable by completing [[Runtuma]]'s time trial challenge. Note that the recipe is obtained by talking to Runtuma after successfully completing the challenge, not from the chest.

Depending on the quality, Magma Eggs restores '''9'''/'''10'''% of Max HP and an additional '''1,000'''/'''1,200''' HP to the selected character. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

Unlike the delicious or normal variant, eating Suspicious Magma Eggs causes the active character to lose 200 HP every second for 10 seconds, for a total of 2200 HP. The character cannot be downed by the HP loss.
