The [[Yae Miko|Guuji]] suddenly decided to rear some ornamental fish and I volunteered for the fishing task so I could slack off on practice.

I thought all it took was to set up the fishing rod, then I could nap till the fish took the bait. I did have a great nap... but when I woke up, there were no fish and no bait! My day off will be ruined if I have nothing to show for the task...

I asked around and you might be the only one who can catch that sort of fish in a short period of time. This is urgent and I hope the letter reaches you quickly.

Both the bait and your lunch are ready, as for payment... I hope head pats count? Just don't pat me for too long! I will wait for you here... Zzz...
