'''Emerald Peak''' is a realm layout in the [[Serenitea Pot]] system. It comes with [[Liyue Estate: Exquisite Mansion]] on Spring Peak.

==Description==
A cloud-piercing mountain peak.<br />Well, that's how it looks, at least. But being inside a teapot and all, the highest mountain probably reaches no higher than the stalk of a tea leaf.
