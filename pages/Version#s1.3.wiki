==Adjustments & Optimizations==
;Battle Pass/Events QoL
*[[Battle Pass]] will be adjusted from Version 1.3 onward to have additional [[Fragile Resin]] rewards. Sojourner's Battle Pass and Gnostic Hymn will obtain Fragile Resin ×1 per 10 levels, starting from Level 5, replacing the [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]]s that was originally there. This will not change the total amount of [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]] gained through the BP. These [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]]s will instead be distributed amongst other levels.
*All [[events]] in Version 1.3 that do not require challenging [[Ley Line Outcrops]] or [[Domain]]s will not consume [[Original Resin]]. The vast majority of large-scale events in future versions will also not consume [[Original Resin]].

;Zhongli Revamp
*[[Zhongli]]'s revamp is scheduled to be released in Version 1.3.<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/7747 Regarding a Further Adjustment to Zhongli]</ref> As the adjustment plan has yet to be finalized, for the planned changes, see the most recent [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/7747 official article].

;Geo Elemental Resonance/Geo Shield Rebalance
*Geo Elemental Resonance/Geo Shield Rebalance revamp is scheduled to be released in Version 1.3.<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/7524 To All Travelers: Regarding Adjustments to Zhongli]</ref> As the adjustment plan has yet to be finalized, for the planned changes, see the most recent [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/7524 official article].

;Mona's Illusory Torrent
* [[Mona]]'s Talent [[Illusory Torrent]] is optimized in Version 1.3. When Mona is hit, she can use Illusory Torrent more quickly.

;Monsters
*Adjusts combat logic for [[Dendro Slimes]]: When a Dendro Slime is hiding relatively far from your location, you will not enter combat mode.

===Other Improvements===
;Pre-install Game Update for Mobile
*Added in a pre-Installation function for mobile device players allowing them to preinstall the game update 2 days before the actual patch date. You can obtain the resource package from the latest version of the game from the login menu or Other > Pre-Install Resource Package.
*You will still have to use the App Store or Google Play Store to download the latest game installation package, and the pre-installed resources will take effect automatically once the previous installation has been overwritten.

;Controller Support for iOS Devices
*Devices that have had their operating systems upgraded to iOS 14 or higher will now support the Xbox Wireless Controller (Bluetooth Version), Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2, PlayStation DualShock 4 Wireless Controller, and iOS-specialized Bluetooth controllers (partial support).

#*Example: A monster who is affected by a relevant element is hit by a Geo attack, causing the Crystallize reaction. As of Version 1.3, providing the monster continues to be affected by the relevant element (i.e. the effect has not worn off), additional elemental reactions can be triggered by attacking the monster with corresponding elemental attacks. (In previous versions, it was sometimes impossible to produce additional elemental reactions after the initial reaction.)

==Known Issues==
#[[Ningguang]]'s Charged Attack movement may lag. This issue will be fixed in [[Version 1.4]].

#Travelers online at the time of the update at 2021/02/05 03:10 had a small chance to encounter an issue whereby character Constellation effects or Shield DMG Absorption effects do not function normally. This issue can be fixed by exiting the game from the Paimon Menu and logging back into the game.
#After reconnecting to the game server, some visual effects for a character's shield may remain and not display properly (however, the actual shield still functions as intended).
