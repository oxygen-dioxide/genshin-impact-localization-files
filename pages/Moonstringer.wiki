|description  = A special fishing rod created for the sake of the [[Lunar Leviathan]]. To tackle this legendary fish, the creator of this rod specially added some material with rare functions onto the rod itself and the fishing line, giving it both great malleability and tensile strength. Of course, such a treasure could easily catch ordinary fish, but that seems like overkill to the point where even the rod might feel ashamed to be used thus.

'''Moonstringer''' is a commemorative Fishing Rod used in [[Fishing]], obtained during the [[Lunar Realm]] Event by completing the [[Over the Moon]] quest.

==Trivia==
*The Chinese name of the rod {{Lang|"Tie the Moon With a Long Rope"|zh=长绳系月|zh_rm=Cháng Shéng Xì Yuè}} is a reference to the Chinese proverb {{Lang|"tie the sun with a long rope"|zh=长绳系日|zh_rm=cháng shéng xì rì}}, meaning the feeling of sadness for time going by so fast.
*Tartaglia is seen using this rod in the web event [[Yummy! Barbecue Under the Stars]].
