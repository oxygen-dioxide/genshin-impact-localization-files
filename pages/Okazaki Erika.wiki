==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Okazaki Erika''': Have a seat, and let me know if you want anything.
<!--:{{DIcon}} I'd like some of that good food, if you don't mind.
::'''Okazaki Erika''': Such flattery! Well, pick anything you like. But I don't think I can sell you alcohol, given your age.-->
::{{DIcon}} So, how did you meet the owner?
::'''Okazaki Erika''': You're asking about us? Well, that's a tough question. It's a long story with a side of karma, that's for sure.
::'''Okazaki Erika''': When I was still young, I was ordered to monitor an important figure at the [[Tenryou Commission]]. Somehow...
::'''Okazaki Erika''': *sigh* Forget it. I can only thank the archons that this person eventually retired, and we could finally get married after that. Thank the archons, indeed!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Okazaki Erika''': Hope you ate well. Come back soon!
