{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Okazaki Erika:''' Have a seat, and let me know if you want anything.<!--
:{{DIcon}} I'd like some of that good food, if you don't mind.
::'''Okazaki Erika:''' Such flattery! Well, pick anything you like. But I don't think I can sell you alcohol, given your age.-->
:{{DIcon}} So, how did you meet the owner?
::'''Okazaki Erika:''' You're asking about us? Well, that's a tough question. It's a long story with a side of karma, that's for sure.
::'''Okazaki Erika:''' When I was still young, I was ordered to monitor an important figure at the [[Tenryou Commission]]. Somehow...
::'''Okazaki Erika:''' *sigh* Forget it. I can only thank the archons that this person eventually retired, and we could finally get married after that. Thank the archons, indeed!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Okazaki Erika:''' Hope you ate well. Come back soon!
