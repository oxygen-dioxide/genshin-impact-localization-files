==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Even though the clues are few and vague, you and Sucrose continue to work at uncovering the mystery behind the prophecy...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Today's the day! Let's go meet up with Sucrose!

;(Talk to Sucrose)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sucrose, we're here!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, Traveler, Paimon! I only just arrived myself, so I'm still getting ready.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah, and Collei just passed by a moment ago. She said she had some things to sort out at the inn where she's staying, but she'll meet up with us when she's done.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Apparently, [[Tighnari]] and [[Cyno]] both went out, but she stayed behind because she wanted to help us.
:{{DIcon}} Understood. How has progress been on your end?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Not too bad. After reviewing it again with fresh eyes, I came up with a new theory which seems to hold some water. I'll attempt to explain it as simply as I can...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I believe that each of the four things in the prophecy refers to a different field of knowledge. So in a way, the prophecy is a test of the reader's intelligence...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But it's unlikely for any one person to have expertise in all these different areas, so I suggest that we seek out one expert from each and get their opinion.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Also, in two out of the four areas, the prophecy seems to want us to find specific people. It may even turn out that the people themselves are the answers.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, so it sounds like we should put our heads together and list out the people who can help us!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Exactly. I think we can go through each riddle in turn and generate four groups of names to match the four questions.
:{{DIcon}} That makes sense.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, then let's start from Group 1! The first riddle was... "a flower that is not of this world."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Personally, I would still go with [[Albedo]] for this one. Alchemy is the most likely to have to do with otherworldly things, and he is by far the leading expert in this regard.
:{{DIcon}} You'd count as an expert too, you know.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! You're the creator of the Tetratanic Sweet Flower. Who knows, maybe that's the flower we're looking for!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Huh? You really think so? Hehe...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, but what about Tighnari? He's a [[Forest Watcher]] and knows all about plants. If it's a flower we're looking for, maybe he's the man for the job!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Alright. I'll add him to the list as well.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' On to Group 2. This subject is... "a guide who will never get lost."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's kind of abstract... Does it just mean someone who never loses their way?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Wait, but they have to be able to guide others, too, so it's not quite as simple as that...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps... an astrologer, then?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean [[Mona]]? Yeah, she'd definitely count!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Mona... Yes, she certainly seems very confident, and she can use her astrology to guide people.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Would [[Bennett]] count?
:{{DIcon}} Huh? Why him?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, his luck's so bad that as long as you go in the opposite direction from him, you'll always be going the right way, right?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 15.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmm, I see... I&mdash;I suppose I can't argue with that logic...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Add him to the list! Finding everyone won't take long, so one extra person won't hurt.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 16.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah, I know! Would Outrider [[Amber]] be a valid candidate for this category as well?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, she would! She's got a great sense of direction, after all. As a matter of fact, when the Traveler and Paimon first came to [[Mondstadt]], she was actually the one who gave us directions.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 17.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yes, she's certainly a good guide.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is there anyone else?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 18.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Let me think... Ah yes, I believe there may be one more.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 19.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Albedo once made a set of equipment for [[Mika]] from the [[Reconnaissance Company]]. He's their surveyor, and an exceptional pathfinder.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 20.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' He's even instructed others in the discipline of surveying before. So in my view, he's highly unlikely to lose his way and would be very good at helping others find theirs.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool. Another one for our list.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 sucrose 21.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...Wait, Collei should've been here by now. Wonder what's taking her so long? ...Sorry, could we continue our chat somewhere else?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you wanna go see how she's doing, right? Sure, let's all go!
----
;(Approach Collei)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hi Collei, hope we're not intruding or anything... Is everything okay?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah! Sucrose! I, uh... I was preparing some... stuff...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Is it time already? Oh no, I&mdash;I'm sorry...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Collei seems to be wrapping gifts, and now she's frantically trying to hide it. I wonder who they're for?)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Don't worry, the Traveler and I only just met up. We were just worried that you might get lost along the way, so we thought that we'd come get you.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Thank you. I'm ready to join you now! Um, how's that thing going?
:{{Black Screen|Sucrose tells Collei about the four riddles and the results of your discussion...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' So let's pick up where we left off.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Next up is the third line: "one who would never lie"... Hmm, anyone spring to mind?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe... [[Diluc]]?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... you really think so? Seems like it would be pretty difficult for someone in his position to avoid having to lie.
;(If the player has sufficiently progressed through {{Quest|Darknight Hero's Alibi}})<!-- the reveal that diluc is the darknight hero is early on in the first quest; unknown if that's sufficient or if full completion of the act is required, and will likely forever remain unknown -->
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Ah yes, his secret alter ego: the Darknight Hero. He must have to deny it if anyone asks. In that sense, he has a complicated relationship with the truth.)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Then what about [[Kaeya]]? He's the Cavalry Captain and a rather popular figure, but...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You think there's something fishy about him too, huh? Yeah... he's definitely a sneaky one! Bet he lies all the time.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm, I can't help but agree with you there...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's the [[Venti|Tone-Deaf Bard]]... Uh, but on second thought, he wouldn't qualify either. He talks way too much nonsense. Hmm... is there anyone else we're missing?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Acting Grand Master [[Jean]]? She has a good name in that regard... but from what I know, she sometimes covers up the truth out of concern for those around her...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' For example, when Lisa loses track of time in the library and misses her patrol shift, Jean'll come up with some excuse, like "Lisa's ill today."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Also, she sometimes makes up stories to get [[Klee]] to behave. Like the one about the big monster that comes to catch naughty kids who don't go to bed on time... D'you think that rules her out?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, white lies are still lies... But do we really have to reject her because of some harmless fibs? It's not like she had evil intentions.
:{{DIcon}} This prophecy seems very strict...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, we're the ones being strict!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' [[Rosaria]] doesn't strike me as the type of person to lie.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah Collei, you probably haven't met her yet, have you? She's a sister from the [[Church of Favonius|church]] who looks, um... a little scary and not very sociable.
:{{DIcon}} What gives you that impression?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' She stopped by the alchemy bench once, a long time ago, and asked me about Albedo.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I thought maybe she was trying to find him, for work or something. But when I asked, she just said that she was curious about him because he was so intelligent, and wanted to talk to his assistant to find out what he was like.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' A lot of people might have given a more tactful justification, but I could see in her face that she wasn't trying to hide anything. She was just very direct and straightforward.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' That's why I don't think of her as the lying type.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Rosaria doesn't look like the sort of person you'd want to get into a fight with... Maybe she just fights her way out of situations that some people might lie to get out of?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I can definitely see that! I've also heard the other sisters say that Rosaria doesn't even make excuses when she skips choir &mdash; she just doesn't show up.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's a tough cookie, huh. Let's put her name down.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' In that case, I think Cyno fits in this list, too!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, true. Lying's probably more trouble than it's worth for someone like him &mdash; kinda like with Rosaria.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and Paimon also nominates [[Razor]]! Bet he couldn't lie to save his life.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I've also got someone else in mind, [[Noelle]], the trainee knight! She's a very honest person. I don't think she'd tell a lie.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alrighty, write her name down too!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 15.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...Wait, there's one more person... You know, our long-standing staffer at the alchemy bench...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You mean... [[Timaeus]]?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 16.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yes, him. Um, truth be told, he's been lovestruck recently.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 17.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' He swore that he wouldn't say a dishonest word or slack off until he succeeds in getting the woman he loves.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Timaeus has a crush!?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 18.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yes, that's right.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, who is it? Do you know her?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 19.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I've never met her. All I know is that she's from Liyue... Timaeus says that she's fun, has a great personality, and is very, very good-looking.
:{{DIcon}} All great qualities, but that says nothing about her identity...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 20.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Since we're on the topic &mdash; helping Timaeus win the lady of his dreams was also one of my goals for this [[Windblume Festival]]!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' But how can we help with that?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 21.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I dunno, make sure he uses nice paper and a fancy envelope when he sends letters to her, help him pick a nice gift and wrap it properly... That sort of thing.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yeah, yeah, yeah! I had the same situation once in the [[Avidya Forest]]. I helped another Forest Ranger out by delivering a love letter to the coworker she likes...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 22.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yep, that sort of thing, exactly! Oh, also, I helped him with some of the groundwork for one of his research projects. He must have appreciated it, because he gave me a refrigeration device that he's been developing as a thank-you gift.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it any good?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 23.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Uh... I mean, it looks nice...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Sounds like a "no."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, alright, guess we'll put lover boy down on the list then.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 24.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Okay, so last of all, we have "a legend that never ends." Anyone come to mind for this particular line?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lisa, perhaps? A librarian understands books best... and aren't most legends written down somewhere?
:{{DIcon}} Not necessarily, but you have a point.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 25.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' When I think about "legends," fairy tales and picture books come to mind.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe Collei! She read a lot of fairy tales when Tighnari was teaching her to read.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh... Do I count?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 26.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Of course you do. I'll put you on the list.
:{{DIcon}} Are you eligible for this one, Sucrose?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 27.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I prefer to read things like "An Illustrated Analysis of Alchemical Substances and Their Uses," "The Fascinating Principles of Crafting," and "Hypotheses of Life"...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Point taken... Paimon didn't quite understand any of those...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 28.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmmm. Klee might be a good choice. Her mother, [[Alice]], is a renowned traveling author, so I'll bet she's been exposed to all sorts of myths and legends.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright then, Klee makes the shortlist!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 29.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Well, that should just about do it. Next up, we should go and ask the people on the list about the prophecy.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Do we have to ask absolutely everyone on the list? It seems like a lot of people...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 30.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' It is, so I was thinking that perhaps we should split up? That might make our search more effective.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okie-dokie!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 31.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Also, I've thought of a method of gathering feedback...
:{{Black Screen|Sucrose shares her idea with everyone...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No problem, we can do that.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 sucrose 32.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' You and {{Traveler}} are practically joined at the hip, so you two can go together. I'll pair up with Collei.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Capable Collei and Sensible Sucrose... sounds like a winning combination!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...Okay, I promise I'll help! Capable Collei... yeah, I got this!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 2 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Rest assured that the unbeatable {{Traveler}} and Paimon will do our part too! Off we go!
:;(Sucrose and Collei reach the Knights of Favonius Headquarters)<!--screen transition; dialogue restarts here if they leave the area-->
:{{A|vo eqfh102 3 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I plan on starting from the person with the most defined stronghold, so let's go to the library. Lisa should be there.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' "Stronghold," That's an, uh... interesting word to use.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 3 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Umm... maybe "den"? No, that's even worse...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' How about... "lair"?

;(Enter the library)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Here we are! Lisa's lair!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Oh no, that was a bad word choice. Now Sucrose is using it and it's all my fault...)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Lisa, might I ask if... Huh?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Sucrose? Collei? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I can only "Sucrose" that they were "Collei"-ng in on someone. At "Lisa," that's as far as "Cyno."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Please... Just stop it with these puns, I beg you. Are you trying to win worldwide fame for unfunny jokes?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Um, is Lisa not here at the moment?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Surprising, isn't it? She went out. I'm afraid it's just us here looking for information.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Except me. I'm not here for information. Like you, I came here on an abortive search for the librarian, who is also my [[Akademiya]] senior.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, so you studied in the same [[Darshan]] as Lisa?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That's right. Her mentor in [[Sumeru]] was also my benefactor. We were both [[Spantamad]] students.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Wow, that's cool... But wait, we're getting sidetracked! We came here to look for some information &mdash; Collei and I are investigating a prophecy, and we were hoping you all might be able to help.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh? What sort of prophecy?
:{{Black Screen|Sucrose and Collei take turns explaining the prophecy and the information that they compiled with the Traveler...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I see... You want to ask them about the "flower that is not of this world," and me about the "one who would never lie."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' But there's no rush! You don't need to answer right away! We're just here to tell you about the situation. You can take your time to think it over, and submit any thoughts you have in written form to the Sucrose Mailbox.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The Sucrose Mailbox?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yep. I was thinking about it on the way, and although these seem like trick questions, there's a lot to mull over once you get down to the details. A quick answer off the top of your head might not go into enough depth.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' So, I decided to place a mailbox next to the alchemy crafting table. Everyone can submit their written answers there when they're ready.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' We don't have to call it the Sucrose Mailbox, though. It could just as well be called the Sucrose and Collei Mailbox, or even the Sucrose, Collei, Traveler, and Paimon Mailbox...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Haha, I think in this case, we CAN just go with your quick answer off the top of your head...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Sounds like a good solution. Certainly more reliable than verbal discussion alone.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Agreed. Certainly when it comes to discerning whether someone is a liar or not, you cannot simply take them at their word.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Understood. Once we've had a look into it, we'll place our replies into your mailbox.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Thank you all so much. Okay, let's tick them off the list, and carry on working our way down...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Mm-hmm. Already done.
:;(Sucrose and Collei leave)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'm pleasantly surprised to see those two introverts getting along so well.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Do you get the feeling that Collei's return to Mondstadt has emboldened her more contrarian side?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yes, I'd noticed that too.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Traveling and meeting old friends are both good for the body and soul.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' And isn't rediscovering one's youth while revisiting old haunts a worthwhile pursuit?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...When I first met Collei, she'd never known happiness or youth.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But things are different now. Her [[Eleazar]] being cured was a huge milestone in her life.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Collei is a very sensitive and introverted child. I'm sure you must have noticed that too, Albedo.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' From the time she's been in my care, I've observed that she's actually a very lively character by nature... but she had a very rough start in life, and it changed her.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' So might I assume that your respective claims of looking for plants and artists in Mondstadt were just pretexts?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I wouldn't say that. Both Collei and [[Genius Invokation TCG]] are very important to me.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Would it really kill you to just say "yes" in this situation?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Fine. Yes, we came out of concern for Collei. She's been back to Mondstadt of her own accord several times, but it has led to no significant improvement in her mood.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Well, it won't hurt to give her some more time. I believe that Sucrose might be able to help her.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Sounds like an extension of your own self-confidence as her teacher.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 09.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You could say that. In a similar vein... I've heard that Sumeru's scholars often build their social relationships based on their academic ones. Is that true?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I suppose it might look like that from your perspective. Sumeru's society is something of a special case &mdash; the reason it is known as the city of learning is because all of its resources are in some way linked to academia.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' As such, academic resources equate to social capital. It is not unheard of, for example, for people to build a family in order to pursue further studies.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' But the relationship between the three of us is not an academic one turned social. We've never even worked on a paper together, for starters.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 10.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh, so the academic paper is the nexus of the academic family? Interesting.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I would think of us more as siblings. An equal and pure relationship, unaffected by academic considerations.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' As much as I'd prefer not to admit it, that statement is not inaccurate.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 11.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I can understand that position. I have a younger sister myself, and it's only natural for me to be protective of her.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 12.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' What you described fits the idea of a city of learning as I imagine it. The family is where all social relationships intersect... as such, a family founded on common goals may actually be more stable.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 albedo 13.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' By the way, who's the eldest between you?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Let's not go down this rabbit hole, please.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' In terms of age, I'm the eldest, of course. He just doesn't want to admit it.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 tighnari 14.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' But your mental age is younger than that. I daresay even by enough to be the youngest sibling. Perhaps I could bring Collei into this happy family to be your elder sister?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 4 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' No... You will never see me admit to being the youngest sibling! Except perhaps as a last-ditch effort to turn the tables in a game of cards.
:{{Black Screen|After bidding farewell to Sucrose and Collei...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess we'll leave Collei and Sucrose to it. Fingers crossed all goes well for them! Now then, where should we go first?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's try our luck at the bulletin board, shall we?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A lot of people tend to show up there at some point in the day &mdash; maybe we'll get lucky!
----
;(Approach the bulletin board)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice! Just as we hoped, there's a load of people here!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Even Lisa's here?
:{{DIcon}} Hi everyone, long time no see.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Hey there, {{Traveler}} and Paimon! It's been a while. How've you been?
:{{Introductory Note|Bennett}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been doing pretty well!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' You look surprised, cuties. Is it because of me?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 razor 01.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Teacher is... not at the usual place.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh please, it's not as if I'm glued to my chair. I like to get out for a little fresh air every once in a while.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Mika's here today, so I thought it'd be a good time to introduce him to Bennett and Razor. They're all out and about quite often, so it's helpful for them to get to know one another.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Hello, everyone. My name is Mika.
:{{DIcon}} Hi, Mika. Good to see you again.
:{{DIcon}} Hello, Mika. Nice to meet you.
:{{Introductory Note|Mika}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' I&mdash;I look forward to working with you...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 bennett 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo eqfh102 6 bennett 02b.ogg}}--> '''Bennett:''' No need to be so formal! We've known them for ages, they're cool!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 razor 02.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Windblume... fun?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, we haven't gotten to the fun part yet! We've been busy investigating a prophecy.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' A prophecy? What kind?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' A good one, or a bad one?
:{{Black Screen|You explain the prophecy and tell everyone what you've learned so far...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Gosh, that all sounds quite fascinating.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I can't believe I made it onto your list of names... You really think I'll be able to help?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 razor 03.ogg}} '''Razor:''' Believe... in yourself!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Right, believe in yourself! You're a first-rate adventurer, Bennett.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 bennett 05.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Okay, then in that case, I'll step up and present my thoughts on the matter! ...Uh, except I forgot I'm not really good at organizing my thoughts... Oops...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's no need to tell us all of your thoughts right here and now! Sucrose said she'll put a mailbox next to the crafting bench, so you can just write down your thoughts when they come to you, and drop them there.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' A meticulous and efficient plan. Yep, that sounds like Sucrose.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 razor 04.ogg}} '''Razor:''' I will think also. Give me some time.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 bennett 06.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' You still have other people on your list that you need to go see, right? We should leave you to it! Don't worry about us, we'll drop off our letters at the mailbox as soon as we're done.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay! Bye for now!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head over to Starsnatch Cliff next! Maybe we'll be able to find some people there.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And even if we don't find any familiar faces... You can see really far from up at the top. Maybe we can find people that way!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 6 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Aw, you're working so hard. Do be sure to get some rest when you can. If you get tired, you know you're always welcome to visit me for a break and a cup of tea.

:{{A|vo eqfh102 7 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Got it! Collei, please follow me.

;(Approach Amber, Eula, Klee, and Noelle)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, it's our lucky day! There are several people over there.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Amber!? Wow, and Eula's with her too...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hmm? Oh, it's Sucrose! And Klee also spies... the girl with the long scarf!
:{{Introductory Note|Klee}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Collei, we were just talking about you! Ah, right, I don't think you've been introduced to Noelle before. Collei, this is Noelle, maid of the Knights of Favonius.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 noelle 01.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Nice to meet you, Collei. I missed you the last few times you were in Mondstadt, so I'm glad to finally meet you in person.
:{{Introductory Note|Noelle}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh! Uh... N&mdash;Nice to meet you too, Noelle! My name is Collei... but you already knew that.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Relax, you two. There's no need to be so courteous &mdash; we're not on some kind of diplomatic mission here.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Klee, what are you doing here? Are you planning to blast some fish?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Nope! Klee's on patrol with the other knights.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Huh, now that you mention it, it looks like everyone here's a Knight of Favonius except for Collei and me...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'd heard that there was a very young knight in the ranks, but it's still a surprise to see with my own eyes...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Collei, what do you do?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'm a Trainee Forest Ranger in the Avidya Forest.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Trainee...?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It means I'm not officially a fully qualified Forest Watcher yet. I'm still learning.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 noelle 02.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Oh, you're just like me! I'm still working towards becoming a fully qualified knight.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Technically, though the distinction is hardly relevant right now. This isn't a very formal patrol... we're just chatting.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Whew... Don't panic, Collei, just pick a topic and join the conversation! Don't panic, whatever you do, don't panic... It's just Amber and her friends. There's no need to be nervous...)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Let me guess... were you chatting about the new guests in town?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yep! A few folks from Sumeru have come to visit, so we're brainstorming a few nice surprises for them...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Amber!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Ah! Sorry, I... uhh...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Hehehe, at least I didn't say anything about what the surprises are...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Oh nooo, how am I supposed to join this conversation now? What do I say to that...)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Speaking of nice surprises... we've actually had a fairly big one recently.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' What kind of surprise? Tell me! Tell me!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Ahh, I'm saved, Sucrose has given me a lead-in. Now, I just need to follow on from what she's already started talking about...)
:{{Black Screen|Sucrose and Collei tell everyone about the "nice surprise" that they've been working on &mdash; namely, of course, the prophecy...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 noelle 03.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' Hmm. What an interesting prophecy... I have no idea what the answers could be, though.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' So essentially, you're gathering information to help you solve the riddles, correct? I'll do my best to help.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Thank you so much, Eula.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Any time.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' There's no need to answer right away. We'll put a mailbox next to the Crafting Bench for people to drop us a note once they've thought of something.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I'll drop something in there for sure!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Nice idea, I think we can all commit to writing a note. We'll see what we can come up with.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yep, don't worry, you can count on us! But we do have to finish our patrol first.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' What route are you taking today?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' We started in the Stormbearer Mountains, and we'll end at the city gates. You'd be very welcome to join us, but it sounds like you're pretty busy with all this.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No &mdash; there's always next time. We'll join up with you after we're done working through this prophecy.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh... yeah, so, um... We'll be on our way for now! Hehe...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 noelle 04.ogg}} '''Noelle:''' See you later! Have a safe trip back.
:;(Sucrose and Collei part ways with the Knights of Favonius)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Are you okay, Collei?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Uhh... was it that obvious?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No, no, not at all. It just looked like you had something on your mind.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ugh, so that means it was obvious... *sigh*
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Whatever's bothering you, you can talk to me about it if you want. I'm happy to help.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 13.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...Thanks, Sucrose.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 14.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Well... the truth is, I don't really know how to act around Amber and the others.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Really? I thought you two were good friends.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 15.ogg}} '''Collei:''' We are... Amber's a really important friend to me...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 16.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...I don't know. I guess, if I'm being completely honest, the problem's probably with me...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 17.ogg}} '''Collei:''' The first time I came to Mondstadt, I was really immature. I didn't wanna let people in, and I was generally pretty awful to everyone... Amber was the one person who didn't give up on me. If it wasn't for her persistence, I wouldn't have found a friend at all.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 18.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Without Amber, I might not even be here today. And because of that, I really look up to her. I think of her as my role model, and hoped that maybe one day, I could learn to be like her...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 19.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...But after trying and failing for several years, I think I've finally realized... I'm no Amber, and I never will be.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 20.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Looking back, it seems silly that I ever thought like that. We're nothing alike at all... My personality's so... weird. I always get so anxious and I overthink everything...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Aw, Collei... don't say that.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 21.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 22.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Um, Sucrose, would it be okay if I... told you a bit about my past?
:{{Black Screen|The two girls come to a stop at a place with some lovely scenery...}}
:{{Black Screen|As the breeze picks up, Collei tells her life story... from her childhood to her recent recovery from Eleazar.}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 15.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 16.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' (I already knew bits and pieces about her, but still... Why did she have to go through all that?)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 23.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'm sorry, we've only just met and I'm already dumping all of this on you... This is why I get so frustrated at myself. I'm always doing this... I get into a spiral of self-doubt, and then I end up having to find somewhere to vent it all out...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 17.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No no no, it's fine! I&mdash;I'm really glad that you're willing to tell me all this.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 18.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' People don't open up about their deepest feelings unless they really trust the other person. Don't you think? At least... I think it's kind of an honor.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 19.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' And I mean... Umm... You've probably noticed by now, but I don't have the best social skills either. I always just end up talking about the things I'm interested in, and going on and on...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 20.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But even so, you still listen to me when I talk my head off about alchemy. It's a relief to listen to you talking about yourself for once.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 21.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' If you hadn't told me all of those things, I never would have guessed that you struggle so much. Honestly, I feel like we're very similar people.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 24.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...R&mdash;Really?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 22.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yeah! Everyone has their own problems to deal with... I certainly do!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 23.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' All the feelings that you talked about just now... I totally get it. It takes so much more effort for us introverts to fit into a crowd.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 24.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' When you were saying about how you try to think about what to say in advance, and you're constantly terrified of saying the wrong thing and making things awkward... I relate to that so much! Oh, and also that part about studying under a genius...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 25.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' In fact, before meeting you, I'd never met anyone who seemed so similar to myself.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 25.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 26.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Um... I'm not very good at giving words of comfort or anything, and I'm not gonna tell you to just get over it or stop worrying about it. How about we just sit here for a little while? We don't have to force a conversation if we can't think of anything. We can just... sit here together.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 26.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Sucrose has stopped talking, but for some reason, this doesn't feel awkward at all. Maybe she's right, and we're more similar than I realized.)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 27.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (In Sumeru, I always like to find a quiet place to just sit and watch the scenery, but it's always by myself. I never thought there'd be a day when I could do this with someone else by my side...)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 28.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (...Mondstadt's breeze is so gentle and soft.)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 27.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hey, Collei... see that cloud over there? Doesn't it look like... one of my test tubes?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 29.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Um... uh... I don't think so... Sorry...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 28.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hehe, then maybe we're not quite on the same wavelength on everything... at least, not when it comes to looking at clouds in the sky.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 30.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 31.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Thank you, Sucrose. I feel much better after talking to you...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 29.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yeah, it helps a lot, doesn't it? I also vent to my flasks sometimes. The next time we get the chance, I have to show you my Tetratanic Sweet Flower and my Tetratanic Windblume...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 32.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Your Tetra-what??
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 30.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Two of my favorite things I've made. They're really cool. I think you might like them.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 33.ogg}} '''Collei:''' O&mdash;Oh, okay! Yeah, you'll definitely have to show them to me sometime!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 sucrose 31.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I brought some crackers with me, you want one? There's cheese flavor or tomato flavor.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 collei 34.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Sure! Hmm... I'll try the cheese one!
:;(The Knights of Favonius watch from a short distance away)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' ...Aw, look! They're enjoying the scenery together!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Shall we go play with them?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' No, it's fine. Let them sit for a while.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber:''' We're not what Collei needs right now. She needs a new friend &mdash; someone different, who's never met her before.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I don't get it... Is there a difference?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 8 ambor 09.ogg}} '''Amber:''' There is! You'll understand once you're a little older, Klee. People can draw different kinds of strength from different kinds of friends, and right now, Collei needs someone that's just not the same ol' me!

:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 02.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' It's been a while, Traveler.
:{{Introductory Note|Rosaria}}
:{{DIcon}} Greetings, everyone. And happy Windblume Festival.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' You two are looking pretty good. I trust you've been well?

:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' You're one to talk! If this sister hadn't grabbed you in time, then you'd have been seriously hurt, if not dead!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 03.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I know, I know... I really am grateful, Miss! I can't thank you enough...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 03.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Don't mention it. Just lending a hand.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Quite literally. And had she not lent him a hand and pulled him up, he would've gone tumbling down the cliffside...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened? Did Timaeus almost fall off the cliff?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 04.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Uh, well... So what actually happened was... I came to Starsnatch Cliff today to pick some flowers, and ran into Mona on the way. She took a look at her scryglass, and advised me to turn back, because it would be dangerous...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But you still came up here anyway...?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 05.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' ...Yes, I did, because there's something I just had to do!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' *sigh* I hardly think giving flowers to your crush is worth throwing one's life away for...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 04.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' It's rare to run into someone with a death wish in this area.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 06.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I don't have a death wish! I just... didn't think it would really come true... I mean, when Mona said "it would be dangerous," I thought I'd be fine as long as I watched my step cautiously. I'm sorry, okay? I was wrong.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 07.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I'm telling you, I'm just here chasing the love of my life. Lovestruck Mondstadters is what the Windblume Festival's all about!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... That explains you, but why is Rosaria here?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 05.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' I was looking for a quiet place to escape the crowds. I wasn't planning on having to save a life along the way.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...So that's why the scryglass just showed "danger" instead of "fatal danger."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 08.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ahaha, very funny... Anyway, {{Traveler}} and Paimon, what brings the two of you to Starsnatch Cliff?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just trying our luck! We've got a lot of people we need to see today, so we've been all over the place. Actually, you're some of the people we were looking for!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 09.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Huh?
:{{Black Screen|You tell them about the prophecy, the information gathered so far, and the mailbox...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 rosaria 06.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' I see. So all we'll need to do is to find some clues, make a note, and drop it off at the mailbox?

:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 11.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I guess this means everyone will find out about my crush now... Hehe...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 12.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I came here because I wanted to give some Cecilias to the girl I love. They'll really suit her. She's&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' No, no, no one asked. Please do not subject us to your gushing about your girlfriend.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 timaeus 13.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Oh... You saw right through me...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 9 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' You said you need clues, right? In that case, Mona Megistus the Astrologist will provide you with a personally handwritten letter. Just wait for it to show up in your mailbox!

:{{A|vo eqfh102 10 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' We really got lucky today &mdash; the vendors were feeling super generous, so we didn't even need to pay for the materials! It's just a shame that Collei got a splinter...

:{{A|vo eqfh102 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, actually, there's one thing that still needs taking care of... Paimon's starving! Hey, Traveler, you wanna get dinner? Your treat?

:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 03.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Just like you, I'm a traveler, visiting Mondstadt from another land.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 04.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Mind if I buy you a drink?
:{{DIcon}} I'm not drinking today. But thank you for offering.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 05.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Leaving the door open for another time, I see. I can tell that you've dealt with a lot of people during your travels.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can tell? Well, we ARE very experienced adventurers, after all!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 06.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' I can. That's why I tried to strike up a conversation with you in the first place.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 07.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' I was on my way to go shopping earlier when I overheard your conversation next to the Crafting Bench. From what I could gather, you are trying to investigate a bizarre prophecy?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! Bizarre is definitely the word...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 08.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Don't you think it sounds just like the kind of story that would happen in Mondstadt? Anyway, that's why I wanted to ask you a favor... If and when you manage to unravel the answer to the prophecy, could you let me know what it is?
:{{DIcon}} Are you interested in it too?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 09.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Not so much the prophecy itself, but Mondstadt as a nation. That's what I'm interested in.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 10.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' I was born in a distant land, but I have family and friends who once lived in Mondstadt for a long time. They said that it's a great place full of fairytales and romance, and recommended that I come for a visit.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 11.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' As it happens, someone I know has an anniversary coming up soon, so I figured this would be a good time to come here and see all the sights that she once saw.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you think about Mondstadt so far?
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 12.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' It certainly lives up to its name as the city of romance and freedom.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, we think so too!
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 13.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' So. About the prophecy...
:{{DIcon}} No problem.
:{{DIcon}} I'll let you know if we find the answer.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 14.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Thank you. You're very friendly, it's been a real pleasure to meet you.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 15.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' I'll leave you to it, then. Hope you continue to enjoy the city, and have a wonderful day.
:;(Scarlett leaves)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She definitely isn't dressed like a local, huh. Where do you think her hometown could be...?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:;(As Scarlett walks away)
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 16.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' "Please find me a flower that is not of this world, and a guide who will never get lost."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 17.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' "Find me one who would never lie, as well as a legend that never ends..."
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 18.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 rosaria 01.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 19.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' I never thought I'd have someone secretly following me even in a free city like Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 rosaria 02.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh102 11 scarlett 20.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Good day to you, Miss.

==Post-Quest Dialogue==
After completing this quest, Cyno and Lisa can be found in the open world. They disappear upon completion of Step 4 of the next quest, ''[[Joy Above the Clouds]]''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Cyno or Lisa in the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters#Library|Knights of Favonius Library]])
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Why, if it isn't my underclassman, Cyno. What a pleasant surprise it is to see you in Mondstadt during the Windblume Festival.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Greetings, Lisa. Though I'm sure you've been aware of my presence in Mondstadt for some time already.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh dear, looks like you've seen right through me. But I was in no hurry. I knew we'd see each other sooner or later.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes. It's just as [[Cyrus (Sumeru)|Professor Cyrus]] said &mdash; shared aspirations always have a way of bringing people into each other's orbit.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe, he always has such a poetic way of wording things. I suppose that's the one respect in which I've taken after him, while in your case...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Yes, it's his wit and eccentricities that have left their mark on you.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmm. I'm not sure that describes me very aptly these days, given that I'm now the General Mahamatra. Still, if we're going to talk about ways with words, I think my deadpan humor is far superior than our professor's.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Is that so? Strange, I heard that you're just Cyno the Adventurer when you're in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...You make a good point.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' What do you think of Mondstadt during this time of year? It's quite nice, isn't it?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes. It's very nice. I think I'm starting to understand your reasons for leaving the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe. I've always prided myself on making wise decisions, and that was certainly one of them.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If our professor had been as sensible as you, he would have had a much easier time in his working life. Being stubborn doesn't help anybody.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Well, if even you feel comfortable criticizing him now that he's retired... it really goes to show how much he's changed.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 09.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Stubbornness is an all-too-common vice among scholars. I hope that never rubs off on you. I'm always happy to see you visit Mondstadt, and experience the feeling of freedom for yourself.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 10.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I heard the latest news about Collei, too. No doubt the traumas of her childhood will persist for a while to come, but I have to say, she appears to be doing quite better this time than on previous visits.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 11.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I suppose you're something of a mentor to her, aren't you? Now that I think about it, the two of you aren't so dissimilar. The power of [[Hermanubis]] once brought you great suffering.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That's all in the past now. Besides, Professor thankfully didn't treat me like a test subject for the priest's power like the higher-ups had hoped, even though I was a desert-dweller.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Instead, he gave me the tools I needed to lead the life I have today. He adopted me, educated me, taught me how to fit into society... I am very grateful to him.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 12.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' You are very gifted, and sometimes that can become its own curse. But he has reason to be grateful to you, too &mdash; without you as his son-slash-student, he may never have changed his stubborn ways.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 13.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' As a fellow student of his, I couldn't be happier for the two of you. ...Ah, look at how quickly this developed from small talk to a deep and serious conversation. That's one thing I do miss about my Akademiya days.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' By virtue of being another of his students, you are as much a part of professor's family as I. It's perfectly natural for a daughter to inherit her father's conversation style.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 14.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' If you say so... I suppose that means I get to call you "baby brother" from now on.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Um... I&mdash;I'd rather you didn't...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh102 lisa 15.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hahaha, yes, there's the baby brother I remember.
