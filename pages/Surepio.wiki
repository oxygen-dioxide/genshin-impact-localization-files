==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Surepio's name is likely derived from {{w|Asclepius}}, the Greek god of medicine; the {{w|Rod of Asclepius}} continues to symbolize medicine and health care even in modern times. Asclepius was one of the sons of the sun god {{w|Apollo}}, fitting with the naming scheme of the other Sunchildren.
