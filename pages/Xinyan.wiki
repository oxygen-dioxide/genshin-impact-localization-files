{{Lang|'''Xinyan'''|zh=辛焱|zh_rm=Xīnyàn}} is a playable {{Pyro}} [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Rock 'n' roll is a relatively unpopular style of music in [[Liyue]], having recently been brought over from [[Fontaine]]. Xinyan, however, loves the sound &mdash; and she's slowly but surely amassing a fanbase of her own as she performs throughout [[Liyue Harbor]].
