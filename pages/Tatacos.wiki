|desc_basic      = Making Tatacos is a three-part process &mdash; you bake the tacos first, you add vegetables and grilled shrimp second, then finally, you drizzle sauce over the top. In Natlan, it's hard to say which is a more common sight &mdash; phlogiston or Tatacos.
|desc_delicious  = When your tongue touches the piping-hot shell and its rich filling, a pleasant fragrance gushes out from within, reminding you of a saying from Natlan &mdash; "Life might disappoint, but Tatacos, never!"
