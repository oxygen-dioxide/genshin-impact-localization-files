==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* ''Ocelotlicue'' means "[she who has] the skirt of jaguars," coming from the Nahuatl words ''{{wt|ocelotl}}'', meaning "jaguar," and ''{{wt|icue}}'', "her skirt," similar to the names of Aztec goddesses, {{w|Coatlicue}} "[she who has] the skirt of snakes," and {{w|Chalchiuhtlicue}} "[she who has] the skirt of jade."
** Alternatively, ''cue point'' is a technique in DJ terminology, which this Talent heavily references. The wordplay is also presented in original Chinese and localized Japanese language.
