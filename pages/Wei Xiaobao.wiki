:'''Wei Xiaobao:''' I might have bought one thing too many...
:{{DIcon}} Impulse purchases?
::'''Wei Xiaobao:''' Ugh, exactly!
::'''Wei Xiaobao:''' Seeing as this was my first overseas trip, I let down my guard and went on a buying spree.
::'''Wei Xiaobao:''' Never mind anything else... What would I do with several dozen bottles of perfume, anyway? I couldn't even give that many away fast enough!
::'''Wei Xiaobao:''' ...But I suppose I can just take it as if I bought a large batch of samples!
::'''Wei Xiaobao:''' I mean, I've still got a long vacation ahead of me. Maybe I could open up new markets by bringing these to other places.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You have a sharp mind for business.
::'''Wei Xiaobao:''' Please, you are too kind. It's merely passable, and is nothing compared to [[Calcagni]]'s eloquence.
::'''Wei Xiaobao:''' Her speech is like the flowers that come with the perfume she sent me. It is quite appealing.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Marcotte|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
