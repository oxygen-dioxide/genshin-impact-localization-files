|text    = Birthdays are not important. Happiness is.

I don't need orders to find out what brings me happiness.

Things like coconut milk, little [[Finches|finches]], and you.

Thinking about these things makes me happy. Seeing them makes me even happier.

I have been practicing facial stretches. When you stop by, I will show you my progress.

With practice, I can now smile, just like you.

Uh... It is a bit stiff. I need more practice.
