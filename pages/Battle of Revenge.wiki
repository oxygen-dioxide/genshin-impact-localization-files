{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Asakura)
:'''Asakura:''' You're here just in time. Today's an important day!
:{{DIcon}} Is this about your weapon...
:'''Asakura:''' That's right! I've been looking all over the place for clues, and I've finally determined the location of that band of Kairagi!
:'''Asakura:''' Today, I will redeem myself and take back my weapon!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! Asakura is really motivated!
:'''Asakura:''' However, I mustn't make the same mistake as before. The Kairagi are numerous, and many of them are unscrupulous.
:'''Asakura:''' As long as they swarm me and drain my stamina, I'll be put on the back foot, and the same thing will happen again...
:'''Asakura:''' Therefore, I want you to accompany me this time.
:'''Asakura:''' I was defeated by them last time because the Kairagi were able to use their numerical advantage and took turns in whittling away my stamina.
:'''Asakura:''' After I ran out of energy, their leader challenged me to a duel.
:'''Asakura:''' This time, I would like you to fend off the surrounding Kairagi while I challenge their leader directly.
:'''Asakura:''' After I cut down that villain, I'll come and help you.
:{{DIcon}} You got it!
::'''Asakura:''' I am grateful for your assistance!
:{{DIcon}} It sounds like I'll be taking on many of them at once...
::'''Asakura:''' Without their numbers, those Kairagi are nothing more than a rabble.
::'''Asakura:''' I have faith in your skills. Even if they decide to rush at you all at once, I still believe they'll stand no chance against you.
::{{DIcon}} You think too highly of me...
:'''Asakura:''' In short, I'll be leaving things to you.
:'''Asakura:''' Now then, let us not delay things. Let's head off.

;(Upon approaching the Kairagi)
:'''Asakura:''' The Kairagi are just ahead.
:'''Asakura:''' Let us go and defeat them!
:'''"Kairagi":''' It's you again? You barely escaped that last time and you're coming back for more?
:'''"Kairagi":''' You've brought a sidekick as well... Hmph, seeing as you haven't learned anything, then we won't bother holding back!
:'''"Kairagi":''' Let's go, everyone! Take them down!

;(After defeating the Kairagi)
:'''"Kairagi":''' Agh! P&mdash;Please, spare me! Where did you get this kind of help...
:'''Asakura:''' Foul villain! Hand my weapon over at once!
:'''"Kairagi":''' You... You're still all hung up about that...
:'''Asakura:''' I am only here to retrieve my weapon. If you tell me where it is, I'll spare you.
:'''"Kairagi":''' This...
:{{DIcon}} Don't waste any more words with him.
:{{DIcon}} Come on, let's find someone else...
:'''"Kairagi":''' N&mdash;No, please! Please stop! I&mdash;I didn't say I wouldn't say anything! We don't have to get this violent!
:'''"Kairagi":''' Th&mdash;That weapon was taken by our boss as part of his collection. If you want it, you can just go to the camp over there to get it from him!
:'''Asakura:''' Well, at least you have some sense.
:'''"Kairagi":''' P&mdash;Please, good sirs, I've told you...
:{{DIcon}} Out of my sight!
:'''"Kairagi":''' At once!
:{{Black Screen|''The Kairagi scurries away...''}}
:'''Asakura:''' Not much martial skill to speak of, but he was quite the runner.
:{{DIcon}} Not to mention pretty quick to sell his buddies out, too.
:'''Asakura:''' The Kairagi are ultimately a motley band who've banded together for their own selfish gain. Loyalty plays no part here, nor does conviction.
:'''Asakura:''' The moment trouble starts brewing on the horizon, they will pack up and leave. This is all too common.
:'''Asakura:''' But fortunately, I had you here to help me. I doubt that they would have capitulated so easily otherwise.
:'''Asakura:''' However, our next stop is their main encampment.
:'''Asakura:''' We will follow our original stratagem. I will take their leader on, and leave the small fry to you.
:{{DIcon}} I'll take care of it.
:{{DIcon}} I can take ten of them at once, no problem!
:'''Asakura:''' Much obliged!

;(Go to the Kairagi camp)
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' You? Hah, aren't you that brat from before? What, are you here to add something to my collection again?
:'''Asakura:''' No. I am here for my weapon!
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' Heh, well, at least you've got some guts. But only one ally, really? You must really take me for a sucker, huh?
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' But you know what? I'll give you a chance on account of your bravery, at least. Come on! Let's settle this somewhere else.
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' Still... it wouldn't be good to leave my boys here with nothing to do, would it? I know! Why don't you ask your little helper to play with them a bit?
:{{DIcon}} Any time they're ready.
:{{DIcon}} Let's hope that their A-game is passable, at least.
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' Hahaha. You've got some lip! Well then, boys, you heard 'em. Let 'em have it!
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' As for you, let's go over there.
:'''Asakura:''' I leave this in your hands...
:{{DIcon}} I'll take care of it.
:'''Asakura:''' You have my utmost thanks. I will slay him quickly and come to your aid.
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' Well, aren't you a talker yourself? You're welcome to try!

;(While fighting the subordinates)
:'''Paimon:''' While Asakura is dueling their leader, let's quickly beat these guys!
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' It's often said that a Doushin's weapon is their dignity. You've lost to me already, so I'm surprised you had the audacity to challenge me to another duel!
:'''Asakura:''' I came here because of my previous defeat... I'll wash away the shame with my own two hands!
:'''"Kairagi" Leader:''' Such insolence... This time, no one will be here to help you!
:'''Asakura:''' I don't need help. I can cut you down, myself!
;(After defeating the Kairagi subordinates)
:'''Paimon:''' Look! Asakura's over there!
:'''Paimon:''' It seems like the Kairagi's leader is running away. That must mean Asakura won the duel!

;(Talk to Asakura)
:'''Asakura:''' From your steady breathing, it seems that those Kairagi were no match for you.
:{{DIcon}} And it seems that you were victorious as well.
:'''Asakura:''' That is indeed the case. Though I must admit that to my shame, I allowed him to escape with but a single stab from my spear due to a feint on his part.
:'''Asakura:''' Still, his wound was very severe. I do not believe that he will emerge to do much ill for at least a few years.
:'''Asakura:''' More importantly, I have defeated him myself and reclaimed my weapon. I am henceforth free from the stain of that humiliation.
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations, Asakura.
:'''Asakura:''' Indeed, I owe you thanks, but I cannot rest yet.
:'''Asakura:''' The reason for this whole incident was my lack of training. I will continue to train hard and refine my skills.
:'''Asakura:''' As such... I shall be counting on you in the future as well to spar with me!
:'''Asakura:''' Ah, yes. Please take these as a token of my thanks. It isn't much, but do accept it.
:'''Asakura:''' Thank you once again!
