:{{DIcon|Idle}} Welcome, welcome!

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kupo Nui:''' Welcome to the Golden Dusk.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about this place...
::'''Kupo Nui:''' We've got a pretty great location, wouldn't you agree?
::'''Kupo Nui:''' It used to be just an old house owned by my family, but Miss [[Amina]] took note of the wonderful scenery here, and suggested that I turn the place into a restaurant.
::'''Kupo Nui:''' It was a fantastic idea. We've had steady business ever since we opened. It seems like both locals and tourists really enjoy having some drinks by the beach.
::'''Kupo Nui:''' The only problem is that I've always had problems securing staff. I have a big family, but only a few of them are interested in helping out.
::'''Kupo Nui:''' So I always tell everyone to help themselves. You can even bring your own ingredients and cook by yourself, we won't charge you anything extra.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kupo Nui:''' Take care, and watch your step.

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Wakea Nui:''' Mom... For all these years, have you really never felt the need to bring everyone together to expand the family business?
:'''Kupo Nui:''' Hmm? Why would you ask something like that, my child? Everyone in the family is gainfully employed. Won't you say that they're all hard at work in their own individual spheres?
:'''Wakea Nui:''' That's exactly what I mean! Instead of each focusing on our own thing, why can't we bring everyone together, so we can all work towards the same goal, and help each other grow?
:'''Kupo Nui:''' Ahh, I see. Well, if that's how you feel, why not bring it up with the group?
:'''Wakea Nui:''' *sigh*... But none of them are willing to give me the time of day. It feels like they're all happy to just stick to the status quo...
:'''Kupo Nui:''' Ah, is that so? Then you should also be happy for them.
:'''Wakea Nui:''' I can be happy for them, I guess, but I'm a little sad for myself. At this rate, I'll never get a second employee for my international travel agency...
