==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Brother Qian is an allegedly-undefeated mahjong player in Liyue Harbor. He is a member of the [[Adventurers' Guild]], which he has apparently been recruiting members for by defeating them in mahjong. He also claims to be in love with [[Lan]], the guild master of the Liyue branch.

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Brother Qian has short black hair. He wears the standard male uniform of the Adventurers' Guild. The uniform consists of two layers of shirt (a long-sleeve white shirt with mandarin collar and a green laced up vest), green vambraces, a red necktie, a green cape collar with a ruffled trim and a triangular back flap, a buckled belt, knee-length green pants with red accents, brown stockings and laced leather shoes. The Adventurers' Guild logo, an eight-pointed star, is printed on the right and back flaps of the collar.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Brother Qian:''' Hey, you think you can handle a round with me?
:'''Brother Qian:''' Don't worry, I'm not here to fight. I mean a round of mahjong. But I've got to warn you, I'm an ace when it comes to mahjong.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:'''Brother Qian:''' Oh, I'm nobody really. I do odd jobs here and there for the Adventurers' Guild, but I'm actually the best mahjong player in all Liyue.
:'''Brother Qian:''' If you're ever looking for the Master of the Liyue Adventurers' Guild, just let me know.
::{{DIcon}} You play mahjong?
::'''Brother Qian:''' Heh, it's what I do best. No one else even comes close.
::'''Brother Qian:''' And what I really love to do to my opponents is raise the stakes to "if you lose, you join the Adventurers' Guild."
::'''Brother Qian:''' I think more people have joined the guild now due to losing to me than those who've actually volunteered. I kid you not!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Surely you didn't gain it via fraudulent means?
:::'''Brother Qian:''' You're right, I didn't. I've never done anything fraudulent in my life.
:::'''Brother Qian:''' That said, in the interests of knowing your enemy as you know yourself, I have schooled up on all the fraudulent methods used by others so that I don't fall prey to them myself.
:::'''Brother Qian:''' ...For example, you often see gamblers wearing a flower on their chest. Actually, they're hollow inside. They use them to store cards, dice, and so on.
:::'''Brother Qian:''' Here, take this. I'd never use it anyways, I'm better than that.
::;(Obtain 3{{star}} [[Gambler's Brooch]] ×1)
::{{DIcon}} What's the secret to being a winner?
:::'''Brother Qian:''' You want to know how to be a winning card player? Alright, I'll tell you.
:::'''Brother Qian:''' The thing is, it's seventy percent skill, thirty percent luck...
:::'''Brother Qian:''' Now, thirty percent might not sound very much but when your opponent's skills and your own are perfectly matched, that thirty percent luck is what decides who will win.
:::'''Brother Qian:''' There is just one exception to this... I've heard that there's a famously unlucky adventurer by the name of [[Bennett]] in Mondstadt...
:::'''Brother Qian:''' If luck's not on your side, it's hopeless, no matter how good your skills are.
::{{DIcon}} Are you the Master of the Liyue branch?
::'''Brother Qian:''' No, I'm not the Master. I'm just a volunteer that helps take care of her more trivial matters, which oftentimes ends up being an arduous and thankless task.
::'''Brother Qian:''' You want to know why...? Heh, that's right, I'm in love with her.
::'''Brother Qian:''' She's not at all like those delicate and helpless-looking girls. No, it's her strong and resolute character that I'm crazy about...
::'''Brother Qian:''' It goes without saying that someone of the Guild Master's disposition won't be easily won. But to me, this is like the ultimate game of chance.
::'''Brother Qian:''' Chasing that thrill is what drives any gambler. The higher the stakes, the more we strive to score the jackpot, no matter the odds. You know what I mean?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:'''Brother Qian:''' Good luck.
:'''Brother Qian:''' If you ever feel the itch to try your luck, you know where to find me.

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Brother Qian:''' Hey, you think you can handle a round with me?
:'''Brother Qian:''' Don't worry, I'm not here to fight. I mean a round of mahjong. But I've got to warn you, I'm an ace when it comes to mahjong.
:{{DIcon}} What are you looking at?
:;(Day 1 dialogue)
::'''Brother Qian:''' Me? Oh, I'm trying to figure out how to set this thing up...
::'''Brother Qian:''' Which way were these lamps supposed to go... I can't remember...
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to try the Illumiscreen.
:;(After completing [[The Illumiscreen: I]])
::'''Brother Qian:''' ...Again? Sorry, you'll need to wait until I've got the new lanterns ready.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:;(Same as usual dialogue)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:;(Same as usual dialogue)
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Brother Qian's dialogue about how gamblers have hollow flowers to hold trick dice is a reference to the lore for the [[Gambler]] artifact set, in which the unnamed woman (the gambler) did that very same trick.
* As he is a skilled gambler, his name is likely to be a reference to {{Lang|mini=1|zh=[[wiktionary:老千|老千]]|zh_rm=lǎoqiān|zh_tl=con man}} (chiefly Cantonese), which can be also read as a person name "Old Qian".<ref>Bilibili Post: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv8715157/ 【原神】璃月里的名字考据]</ref>
