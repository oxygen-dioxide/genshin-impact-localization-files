|description = Humanity's best friend!<br>Legend has it that the [[Inazuma Shogun]] once greatly adored this canine breed, and they spread across the once-booming trade routes to become one of the most well-loved pets in the seven nations. Gentle, loyal, and intelligent, they are especially good at guard duty and being companions. Some say that there are still mysterious ninjas in [[Inazuma]] who train these dogs to become "ninja dogs."
