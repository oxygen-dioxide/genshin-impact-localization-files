| During the "Kaboomball Kombat" challenges, Travelers must use Dodoguards to reflect Kaboomballs and deal damage to the Dodofortresses!<br />Depending on the timing of your Dodoguards hitting the balls, the reflection will be either a Normal Return or a Perfect Return. Of the two, Perfect Returns deal more damage!<br />Defeat as many Dodofortresses within the time limit as possible to earn the highest score!
