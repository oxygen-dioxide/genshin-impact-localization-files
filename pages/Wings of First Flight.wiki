'''Wings of First Flight''' is a [[Wind Glider]] obtained during the quest [[City of Freedom]].

==Lore==
It's been a long time since the Outriders last had new blood added to their ranks.<br />
[[Amber]] has always wanted to give this wind glider to a junior knight with potential.<br />
But after a few years, this opportunity never came.

The Outriders use their wind gliders a great deal, and they would eventually suffer wear and tear.<br />
With Amber's movement style being very taxing on her wings, she went through over ten gliders before she knew it...<br />
And yet, she never once considered taking this special pair of wings out for use.

For some reason, her mood was especially good that day.<br />
She finally put that long-unused wind glider on.<br />
Though she had a combat mission on hand to clear out some hilichurl camps,<br />
And though gliding had become especially dangerous in those recent, gale-swept days.

As for what happened after that...<br />
She didn't know why she'd chosen to believe that gold-haired [[Traveler|outlander]].<br />
She didn't know why she felt that they had potential.<br />
But if it was them, perhaps...

"So, the present I want to give you is..."
