==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yueshu:''' Welcome to the Xinyue Kiosk. May I have the table number of your reservation?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Can I get food to-go?
::'''Yueshu:''' Certainly! Please take your pick from the very finest that Yue cuisine has to offer.
:;(Opens the [[Xinyue Kiosk#Shop|Xinyue Kiosk Shop menu]])
:{{DIcon}} I haven't booked, can you squeeze me in?
::'''Yueshu:''' The Xinyue Kiosk is the most popular restaurant in Liyue Harbor for Yue-style cuisine, and we only have a limited number of tables at specific hours of the day...
::'''Yueshu:''' So unfortunately, we tend to book up around three months ahead of time. This has been the situation for quite some time now.
::'''Yueshu:''' After all, the Xinyue Kiosk is an enduring favorite among true fans of classic Yue-style seafood.
::'''Yueshu:''' I'm afraid everyone has to wait their turn, even employees. My husband and our children are still waiting for their lucky day too! Haha...
::'''Yueshu:''' It's no surprise this place is so popular. It's the most authentic Yue cuisine you will find anywhere.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Yueshu:''' The Xinyue Kiosk looks forward to serving you in <!--the-->future! Three months or so in the future, if you reserve soon...
