==Trivia==
* The statues around the inverted pool are the same as the ones in front of the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], whether they are tied by lore or simply reused assets is currently unknown.
* The architecture of the buildings in the Nameless Ruins are almost identical to the ones found in [[Enkanomiya]] with identical geometric and triangular shapes, strips of gold, vertical sliding doors and pillar designs.
