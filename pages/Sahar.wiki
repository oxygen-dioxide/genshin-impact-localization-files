==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sahar:''' Hi there, are you a traveler here to shop at the Grand Bazaar? I suggest you go to Jut's shop.
:{{DIcon}} Why's that?
::'''Sahar:''' In Sumeru, spices are a must-buy, and Jut's is the best spice store you can find around.
::'''Sahar:''' Not only the quality high, but the prices are very reasonable. He even sells the rare Padisarah!
::'''Sahar:''' He also gives customers small gifts on occasion, so you definitely don't want to miss his store when you come to the Grand Bazaar.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the recommendation.
::'''Sahar:''' You're welcome. I'm sure you'll love it there.
