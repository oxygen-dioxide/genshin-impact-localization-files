'''Irmin''' was a king of [[Khaenri'ah]], suggested to be the last king of the [[Eclipse Dynasty]] before the [[cataclysm]] occurred.<ref name="HS">Event [[Hidden Strife]] Optional Letter: [[Hidden Strife/Story#The Brick|The Brick]]</ref>

==Profile==
Little is known about Irmin besides the fact that he only had one eye. After his "strength failed," the [[Alberich Clan]] took the mantle as regents of Khaenri'ah. However, they were unable to revive the fallen nation.<ref name="HS" />

==Trivia==
* The [[statuettes]] dropped by [[Abyss Heralds]], [[Abyss Lectors]], and [[Shadowy Husks]] depict a one-eyed figure, possibly Irmin. The statuettes are described as possibly representing a holy icon<ref>{{Ref/Item|Gloomy Statuette}}</ref> and inspiring courage in those who know their significance.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Dark Statuette}}</ref> If they are indeed modeled after Irmin, they would indicate he was missing his left eye.
** Of the few Khaenri'ahns presently depicted in human form, most of them ([[Pierro]], [[Dainsleif]], and [[Kaeya]]) are shown to cover the right sides of their face at all times, generally (though not always) including their right eyes. This is potentially a cultural practice that mirrors Irmin's missing left eye.
*** [[Halfdan]], a former Khaenri'ahn royal guard who worked under Dainsleif's command, leaves his face fully unobstructed. This may indicate that it is a practice exclusive to those of higher stature, as Pierro was a royal mage of Khaenri'ah,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Mocking Mask}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref> Dainsleif was captain of the royal guard,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref> and Kaeya is a member of the Alberich Clan.<ref name="HS" /> Alternatively, it may indicate it was a practice picked up after the nation's fall, which Halfdan did not consciously live to see.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Black Serpent Knights' Glory}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* The name "{{wt|Irmin||German}}" has Germanic roots but is not clearly defined, and several different interpretations of the name exist. It is believed to mean "Great" and is often used in compound words.
** The Germanic tribe of {{w|Irminones}} is believed to be descended from Erminus (or Armen, among other spellings), one of the sons of {{w|Mannus}}. This belief led to Guido von List's {{w|Arminism}} &mdash; named after ''Armamen'', whom List postulated to be ancient Aryan priest-kings &mdash; and {{w|Armanen runes}}, which were derived from the Germanic {{w|Futhark}} runes.
*** [[Languages#Runes|Similar runes]] can be seen in-game through the tutorial images about [[Abyss Mages]]' shields. However, in gameplay, they typically use Enochian runes instead.
** The Viking Age Norse equivalent for Irmin is ''Jörmunr'', which is used in the {{w|Poetic Edda}} as an epithet for the Norse god {{w|Odin}}.
** The word "[[Irminsul]]" is a compound of ''Irmin'' (great) + ''sûl'' (pillar). In Saxon beliefs, Irminsul were sacred, pillar-like objects; in-game, "Irminsul" is the English localization's name for the silver-white trees found in [[domains]], which are linked to the [[ley line]]s. (See [[Irminsul#Localization|Irminsul § Localization]] for additional information.)
