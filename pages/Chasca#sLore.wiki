==Personality==
{{Quote|The Peacemaker of the Tlalocan, the ender of all disputes.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Chasca hails from the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]. She is afflicted with a rare disease that caused her biological parents to abandon her in the wilds, though she survived and ended up being adopted by a group of [[Qucusaur]]s. Eventually, upon returning to human society, she was adopted by [[Chuychu]]'s parents. Among the tribes in Natlan, she is regarded as a peacekeeper, resolving tribal disputes without difficulty.<ref>{{Ref/VO|character=Kachina|vo=About Chasca}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|page=To Reclaim an Ancient Name|quote=Wayna: Oh, Chasca's a peacekeeper, so she's famous throughout the tribes. She's always the one people call to resolve conflicts, so we slowly got to know each other that way.}}</ref>

{{Quote|...We have come to a full and thorough understanding of the folly and recklessness of our recent actions, and agree to set aside our differences and move forward as one... This statement has been drafted entirely of our own free will, with no objections whatsoever. Additionally, we would like to thank the Peacemaker for her outstanding contributions with respect to facilitating this reconciliation.|A "heartfelt" joint statement of reconciliation, made by a pair of chiefs after an inter-tribal conflict}}
"...There's no hope for the child... You know I can't accept that either! But, please... just give up."

This was the first "conflict" that Chasca experienced in her life.

"...Just what's wrong with this kid? Was she raised by a [[Qucusaurus]] or something? No wonder she's so wild..."

This was one of the countless "conflicts" that Chasca faced after returning to the [[Flower-Feather Clan]].

Though her childhood memories were already blurry, Chasca still remembered the emotions stirring beneath those words: disappointment, pain, bitterness, and frustration... People were caught in a web of emotions, forever entangled in "conflict."

But "conflicts" can eventually be resolved. All it takes is a turning point.

"...Kraa?" A Qucusaurus, soaring high up in the sky, just so happened to catch sight of the helpless "child" crying piteously for food down below.

"At least give me a heads-up next time!" [[Chuychu|A young girl]], after practically having searched the length and breadth of the mountains, puffed with anger after finding her runaway "sister."

...Perhaps many "conflicts" weren't as deeply rooted, or as difficult to "transcend," as people imagined?

Gear packed and bullets loaded, Chasca &mdash; who was now a fully-fledged Peacemaker &mdash; stepped through the door to embrace the morning breeze.

"This time... it's my turn to resolve some conflicts." Lowering the brim of her hat, she smiled to herself.

              --><p>So long as she is on the battlefield, even the fiercest fight will cease into silence in short order.</p><!--
              --><p>This is not entirely due to her eloquence or skill as a mediator, nor is it wholly a consequence of her ability to come up with satisfactory solutions based on her deep grasp of human nature. Instead, it's more that...</p><!--
              --><p>This "Peacemaker" is just ludicrously strong, and she fights in a manner that makes a mockery of common sense. To engage her head-on is comparable to an unarmed newborn babe challenging the fiercest Qucusaurus.</p><!--
              --><p>Those infatuated with conflict often also fear strength, and thus they commonly find sitting down to talk the best choice when confronted by power far beyond their own.</p><!--
              --><p>Still, they wonder, how is Chasca always able to appear at the center of conflict at just the right moment?</p><!--
              --><p>With such uncanny accuracy, such fortuity, it is as if she is drawn in by conflict itself, or rather... like a "beast" who catches the scent of her "prey."</p>

|text2         = <p>Chasca has lived alongside Qucusaurs for as long as she can remember.</p><!--
              --><p>Initially, she believed herself to be a Saurian, though she lacked the hooked beak and sharp talons her [[Chimpu|mother]] and [[Coya|elder sister]] possessed, and she could not fly, nor could she leap into the crowns of trees in a single bound.</p><!--
              --><p>Her mother loved her just as she did her own flesh and blood, and when returning from a hunt, would always ensure her daughters ate their fill first, before contenting herself with the remainder.</p><!--
              --><p>However, Chasca was not content to remain a fledgling waiting to be fed.</p><!--
              --><p>Once she was finally grown enough to race across slopes and bound over rivers, she would often leave the nest to watch her mother and sister hunt.</p><!--
              --><p>She would remember how they fought, and adapt those techniques for her own use. She had no wings she could spread to fly, so she would leap amongst the treetops. She was not born with beak and claw, so she would arm herself with stones in their place.</p><!--
              --><p>All too eager to attempt a hunt of her own, she wandered the woods until at last, her first mighty foe came forth &mdash; a foraging [[Forest Boar]].</p><!--
              --><p>Imitating the Qucusaurs' movements, she leaped at the boar, only to be sent spinning to the ground by its fierce charge.</p><!--
              --><p>Rolling to her feet, she snatched up a nearby rock and hurled it, only for the boar to dodge.</p><!--
              --><p>Ultimately, she was forced to return empty-handed, her whole body ragged, covered head to toe in injuries and abrasions.</p><!--
              --><p>Her mother brought herbs to treat her, and her sister vigorously opposed any future forays.</p><!--
              --><p>Chasca agreed to stay and heal in the nest, but dove into the mountains the instant her wounds closed.</p><!--
              --><p>She shuttled between forest and stream, collecting all manner of odds and ends to use: Sharp-edged stones, sturdy sticks, sticky sap, the skins of dead animals...</p><!--
              --><p>Her family did not quite understand the purpose of all this "junk," but thought Chasca having a new hobby was a good thing nonetheless.</p><!--
              --><p>They never imagined she would use them to fashion a new weapon &mdash; a slingshot made from sticks and skin, all the better for shooting stones both faster and further.</p><!--
              --><p>...</p><!--
              --><p>The Forest Boar had a little [[squirrel]] cornered, yet what it had not realized was that it too had entered another's hunting grounds.</p><!--
              --><p>Without warning, it found something stuck to its hooves, and it struggled in vain to get free. Then, several sharp objects, whistling through the air, struck its skull one after another. With a cry, the boar fell into a dead faint on the spot.</p><!--
              --><p>Only then did Chasca emerge from the bush and excitedly drag her trophy back to the nest.</p><!--
              --><p>Her mother and sister thought then that Chasca would surely become a skilled huntress &mdash; yet the way events were to unfold would far exceed their expectations once again.</p><!--
              --><p>Chasca contemplated and discovered ever more combat techniques, as if there was always some voice in the dark guiding her on, showing her more ways to fight.</p><!--
              --><p>But the longer she followed this voice, the less willing she became to skulk in the shadows. She became obsessed with seizing the initiative, with matching herself against bird and beast alike.</p><!--
              --><p>[[Brown Deer]], [[Flying Squirrel]]s, [[Halberd-Crest Bird]]s, each in their turn she would eagerly challenge. Rather than being a huntress skilled in the singular, fatal ambush, she was more akin to an unyielding warrior, one who sought battle and would find rest only in death.</p><!--
              --><p>But the more addicted she became to the thrill of the fight, the less prey she would obtain &mdash; for animals tend to be the vigilant sort, and having recognized in her a formidable foe, they naturally choose to flee at the first chance.</p><!--
              --><p>Young Chasca thus faced a quandary: the intoxication of battle, or a full stomach...</p><!--
              --><p>And what an impossible choice that seemed to her then!</p>

              --><p>When her adoptive human father [[Cusco]] first laid eyes on her, he took one look at her, her eyes feral and fierce as her teeth tore into raw meat, then stared back at Elder [[Allpa]], who was planning to give her to him, and his jaw dropped so far you could have stuffed a whole Saurian egg into his mouth.</p><!--
              --><p>"Um, Elder... I know I agreed to take an orphan in... but, you didn't say it was an orphaned Qucusaurus!"</p><!--
              --><p>Given the frequency with which Natlan faces Abyssal invasions, it was not uncommon for war orphans to be adopted, but one like Chasca, abandoned by humans and adopted by Saurians... That was the stuff of legends, and legends alone.</p><!--
              --><p>As events would prove, Cusco had in fact underestimated the destructive might of this "Qucusaurus." Qucusaurs were already well-known for doing things their own ways, but Chasca's temper would prove harder to restrain than even the proudest among that race of Saurians.</p><!--
              --><p>"That vulture! She's stolen meat from the warehouse &mdash; again!"</p><!--
              --><p>"My house isn't your damn nesting ground, you little vulture!"</p><!--
              --><p>"Damn.. the little vulture's started another fight!"</p><!--
              --><p>Worse still, Qucusaurs usually had some specific intention behind their actions. To obtain food perhaps, or to defend their territory... but little Chasca seemed set on kicking up trouble for its own sake. She had food far more delicious than raw meat set before her at the table, and her bed was far softer than a roost of straw, but still she would constantly stir up conflict, day and night.</p><!--
              --><p>This really had Cusco's brows all knitted up. He had realized that this might not be some simple wildness of temper, or an inability to adapt to her new circumstances... But what was the root of it?</p><!--
              --><p>Humans would die for money, and monsters for food, but this? This pursuit of conflict without gain, without negotiation, without anything but a desire for destruction? Only one other example sprung to mind &mdash; the Abyss.</p><!--
              --><p>...Perhaps it was time to have a good "talk" with his daughter.</p><!--
              --><p>And so, when Chasca next got herself in hot water, only barely restrained by two elite members of the flying squad, Cusco hurried over to apologize once more for not watching over her carefully enough, then rubbed his forehead in exasperation and asked:</p><!--
              --><p>"...Now, what do you want? If you never speak up, no one will ever understand."</p><!--
              --><p>"The hell are you even asking her for, Cusco? This vulture can't even say a single damn word! Seriously, what were you and the Elder thinking..."</p><!--
              --><p>Little Chasca glared venomously at the flying squad members holding her down, a growl forming in her throat, before it warped into a single hoarse "word":</p><!--
              --><p>"V... Vultures!"</p><!--
              --><p>...Well, that was a start, Cusco thought with a wry smile. As far as communication went, a counter-insult still counted.</p>

              --><p>The shaman sighed, thinking for a moment, before speaking again, words weighty and considered.</p><!--
              --><p>"...Perhaps it might be best for all if we took this chance to return her to the forest now."</p><!--
              --><p>Cusco could hear the implied meaning. Dealing with Chasca was hard enough now, and she was still little now. Who knew what she might be like in the future?</p><!--
              --><p>The Abyss was ever Natlan's nemesis, and to keep her in the tribe was to house a potential calamity.</p><!--
              --><p>But unless they were to find some way to restrain the Abyss within... a "return to the mountains" was but a euphemism for "abandoning her to her fate."</p><!--
              --><p>Chasca's desire for battle was inborn, just as all humans are born with a desire for food. Others fought for a reason, and once their objectives were achieved, there was no further need to push themselves further.</p><!--
              --><p>But Chasca's yearning was as a bottomless hunger. Even the sweet taste of constant victory could only sate her for so long.</p><!--
              --><p>If that craving could not be contained... then perhaps her fate would be to destroy all around her until nothing remained, or be slain in some fierce battle.</p><!--

              --><p>Fortunately, Chasca appeared to have become much better behaved since learning the word "vulture." At least now, when she had some minor disagreement with someone, she could open up with some insults rather than going straight to delivering a beating.</p><!--

              --><p>Chuychu shook her head frantically as that thought flashed through it.</p><!--

              --><p>Dimly, she felt some warmth on her face, like the light cover of Mom's wings, like the light of human candles. Chasca opened her eyes slowly.</p><!--
              --><p>Before her was a humble bonfire, and a young girl squatting and tending it carefully &mdash; Chuychu.</p><!--
              --><p>"...Ah!" Realizing that Chasca was awake, Chuychu hastily hid her hands behind her back. In the firelight, Chasca could see that her hands had been slightly burned.</p><!--
              --><p>"...Are your hands okay?" Chuychu deflected.</p><!--
              --><p>Only then did Chasca notice the bandages wrapped snugly around her hands. It was clumsy work, but enough to stop the bleeding.</p><!--
              --><p>"...I couldn't move you, so I had to make do here... But I've lit a fire, so the adults should find us soon enough."</p><!--
              --><p>Chasca did not answer, but the question her eyes asked was clear.</p><!--
              --><p>"...Well, Mom and Dad would be sad if something happened to you."</p><!--
              --><p>"..."</p><!--
              --><p>"Also... Thanks for standing up for me. I'm sorry for yelling at you before asking what happened."</p><!--
              --><p>"..."</p><!--
              --><p>"Anyway... Let's go home, okay?"</p><!--
              --><p>"...Home..." Chasca broke her silence, mumbling the new word she had just learned. Then she nodded. "...Let's 'go home.'"</p>

|text7         = <p>The first time the Flying Captain, Elder Allpa, came forward to teach Chasca, it was because her front door had been virtually blocked up by the deluge of complaints about Chasca and the beatings she'd handed out.
But no matter how long Allpa spent laboring over explanations of the human world and its laws, little Chasca could never understand what was wrong with fighting.</p><!--
              --><p>Saurians and beasts all decided things through strength. She'd won the fight, so why was she the one being questioned?</p><!--
              --><p>Allpa would talk and gesticulate, while Chasca would study her, wondering if she might be spared the lengthy lectures if she could simply defeat the Elder.</p><!--
              --><p>But the second time she came to give Chasca guidance, she immediately realized that there was something different about the girl's gaze.</p><!--
              --><p>"...Teach me. Become strong." With those choppy words, Chasca asked to learn human ways. "Abyss... want to defeat."</p><!--
              --><p>"...Alright. In that case, let me teach you to use humanity's greatest weapon."</p><!--
              --><p>So saying, Allpa grabbed a woven scroll, an exquisite line of small words embroidered at its head: "Peacemaker &mdash; the Art of Communication."</p><!--
              --><p>"Our greatest weapon is our language."</p><!--
              --><p>But what did flapping one's lips have to do with strength? Chasca did not quite understand.</p><!--
              --><p>She would rather learn how to use various weapons, from bows to guns, or perhaps how to use Phlogiston, or how to shoot while in the air.</p><!--
              --><p>If one was strong enough, talk could be dispensed with... That was how she had thought in the past, at least.</p><!--
              --><p>But still, she had not been able to tear that voice from her heart and beat it until it stopped talking ever again.</p><!--
              --><p>So she endured, learning every last word that Allpa taught her, chewing on that woven scroll that she never thought she would read, bit by bit, line by line.</p><!--
              --><p>As it turned out, when she learned to communicate, coordinate, and rely on others, the efficiency of her hunts seemed to increase &mdash; just as the scroll had said.</p><!--
              --><p>When she wrote Chuychu a letter on her birthday and wished her well, she and their parents seemed pleasantly surprised &mdash; just as the scroll had said.</p><!--
              --><p>And when she took part in the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], bearing the expectations of all on her shoulders, it seemed as if the people of the Flower-Feather Clan looked upon her with a little more respect &mdash; just as the scroll had said.</p><!--
              --><p>...</p><!--
              --><p>"Here you go. The highest possible caliber, and the greatest possible mobility... If this request had come from anyone else, from someone whose abilities I wasn't so sure of, I'd have used the materials they gave me to beat some sense into them."</p><!--
              --><p>"Thanks, [[Xilonen]]. This should make me a more persuasive mediator." Upon receiving the almost comically huge "Soulsniper: Ritual Staff," Chasca tested its weight using the reins in her hand.</p><!--
              --><p>"I'll say... Who'd disagree with you after being hit with this thing, anyway? This has to be the strongest weapon I've ever made for your tribe."</p><!--
              --><p>"...No, 'a bullet has the most power when it has yet to leave the chamber.'"</p><!--
              --><p>As she caressed the cylinder of the gun, this analogy that Chasca had encountered in a certain woven scroll came back to her, unbidden.</p><!--
              --><p>"The strongest weapon, huh... Then, from this day forth, we shall be the 'Peacemakers.'"</p>

|text8         = <p>By that point, she had long since grown from the feral girl who stirred up conflicts into a Peacemaker who ended them in droves.</p><!--
              --><p>There was almost no dispute that could not be resolved by her intervention, whether it be between humans, tribes, humans and Saurians, or even between Saurians.</p><!--
              --><p>But if there was some force beyond rational understanding, with whom even the greatest communicator could achieve no consensus, it would be the Abyss.</p><!--
              --><p>Since she had learned to live with "that" which lived within her, "its" voice had grown ever weaker, and indeed, Chasca even thought "it" gone for a time.</p><!--
              --><p>But in that [[Night Warden War]], "it" was invigorated by the Abyss, and like a butterfly bursting from a chrysalis, it manifested as an illusion &mdash; one identical to her.</p><!--
              --><p>"We meet at last. Long have we fought, with neither of us able to overcome the other... But come, let us end this. Approach me, embrace me... and the greatest strength shall be yours."</p><!--
              --><p>As the battle wore on, the more monsters Chasca slew, the greater the hold the Abyssal power had over her, and once more, she felt her battle lust growing ever greater.</p><!--
              --><p>Eager were her steps as she sought another target to slay, spent casings and corpses alike piled up at her feet.</p><!--
              --><p>On that horrific battlefield, the illusion with its outstretched hand seemed almost like an envoy bringing peace.</p><!--
              --><p>But instinct brought Chasca's gun up and level with it. This was her best chance. It was time to reduce this hateful voice to a bloody mess, once and for all.</p><!--
              --><p>"So you'll kill me, then? But who will understand you, who will keep you company... if not me?"</p><!--
              --><p>More phantasms emerged and rushed her, bringing the feelings she'd kept buried back into the open:</p><!--
              --><p>Once, she had been dropped like a hot potato, alienated by all.</p><!--
              --><p>She was no Saurian, but she was not "human" in any normal sense, either. She had a "home," yet she walked a solitary path.</p><!--
              --><p>None could understand the anxiety that seared her heart, nor put out that roaring fire.</p><!--
              --><p>That illusion was like a vision of water after a parched travail through the desert.</p><!--
              --><p>Could she really put an end to this endless conflict, right here and now?</p><!--
              --><p>As she walked forward, step by step, the power of the Abyss enshrouded her, and she shivered and grew faint. Yet this feeling was also familiar, like that of an infant returning to their mother's embrace.</p><!--
              --><p>She had once been abandoned. Was this where she had always belonged?</p><!--
              --><p>...</p><!--
              --><p>But just as she was about to touch that apparition, voices filled with warmth called out from behind her.</p><!--
              --><p>"Hey, Sis. Leave a note next time you leave home, alright?"</p><!--
              --><p>"You're free to choose your own path in life, but remember, you'll always have a home here with us."</p><!--
              --><p>("Why have you even come back here? You've chosen to live with humans, haven't you?")</p><!--
              --><p>("Coya's just prone to harsh words. We all miss you, really...")</p><!--
              --><p>Shaking her head, Chasca stopped moving.</p><!--
              --><p>Once, she had blindly followed the voice in her heart, hungering for battle and for greater strength.</p><!--
              --><p>Even now, it was true that she still walked alone out of habit, but she now knew the meaning of the bonds she'd forged as a "human."</p><!--
              --><p>Raising her gun once more, she took aim, and let fly with all the bullets she had in it.</p><!--
              --><p>The phantom shattered like a mirror when struck, red ichor seeping between the shards.</p><!--
              --><p>"Hah, you hypocrite... You say you wish to stop fights, and yet you raise your gun to me. How pathetic."</p><!--
              --><p>The apparition vanished like smoke, leaving only a hollow voice that rang in her ears.</p><!--
              --><p>"No. I know 'you' too well. That's why I'm sure that this is the only way to make peace between us."</p><!--
              --><p>Chasca ejected the spent shell casings, and prepared to reload, only for a "bullet" to drop to the ground, tinkling as it did.</p><!--
              --><p>Lowering her head, she saw that it was a Vision, shining with its own light.</p><!--
              --><p>Picking it up, she flicked it into the air with her thumb before catching it.</p><!--
              --><p>"Bring it on, then. No matter how many disputes await, I'll pacify them all... 'You' included."</p>
