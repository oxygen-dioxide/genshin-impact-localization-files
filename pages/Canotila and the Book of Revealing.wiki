{{Location Intro|description=
The location of an enigmatic book written by [[Rene]], originally hidden in the walls of [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]] and found by [[Canotila]].

The player can teleport to [[??? (Fontaine)|???]] from this location, and first does so during the {{Quest|Book of Esoteric Revelations}}.}} 

A map icon acting as a permanent [[Teleport Waypoint]] to this location will appear upon completion of the quest.

Submitting all pages of the book grants the achievement [[Narzissenkreuz Notes: The Labyrinth]].
