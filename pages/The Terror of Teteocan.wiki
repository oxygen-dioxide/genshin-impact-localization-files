==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
<!-- NPC dialogue not included -->
;(Talk to [[Pisasa]] after talking to all three victims)
:'''Hidalgo:''' Hah! Finally got you! Let's see you run off this time!
:'''Pisasa:''' Rrowr?
:'''Hidalgo:''' Breaking fences, overturning grain, and the near-breakage of the blacksmith's roof... You're getting what's coming to you for that, and you're getting it from me!
:'''Pisasa:''' Hroo, rrooo...
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, how is a small lil' [[Tatankasaurus]] like that still so strong?
:'''Paimon:''' Y'know... Would Paimon get super strong if she trained together with some of 'em? She might even be able to help you knock a [[Lawachurl]] flat on its butt... Eh, then again, probably not.
