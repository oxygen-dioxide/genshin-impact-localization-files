==Lore==
This is proof that you came to this world via special means.<br>
This is the seal of which only one who has pierced the celestial heights is worthy.

"[[Traveler|Your]] journey will become very dangerous from now on,"<br>
So that person told you.<br>
"I don't know if this cloth will do anything to protect you, but..."

It was indeed so-<br>
In your long journey, you have seen the birth and death of stars as they passed you by,<br>
Scattering the darkness briefly before being consumed once more.<br>
This cloth will block neither heat nor cold, nor will it defend you from curses and ill-will.<br>
But during long nights in [[Teyvat]], you will sometimes throw it on and find it to be most useful indeed.

"But when you face a force enough to destroy one, or even two worlds,"<br>
You do not truly remember who it was who had treated the [[Traveler's Sibling|two]] of you ever so gently. You wish you could remember...<br>
"When you face a [[Abyss|boundless darkness]], or an [[Light Realm|all-consuming radiance]]..."<br>
But that was one world ago.

You no longer need to sleep out in the wild.<br>
Your bed in the city is fluffy and comfortable. And if you must camp, the grass is soft, filled with the fragrance of life.<br>
So from the moment you received that [[Wings of First Flight|wind glider]] from [[Amber|that girl]], you had already thought of a new use for that cloth...

And now, you shall once again soar through the skies together with it.

|de_note = The German word {{de|Niederkunft|lit=low arrival}} is an archaic word for "childbirth" or "delivery of a child." However, it can also mean "liberation" or "rescue," as {{de|Niederkunft}} was historically used in the Bible for the birth of Jesus Christ. This localization interprets the Chinese {{zh|s=降临|t=降臨|rm=jiànglín}} as the Advent and the birth of Jesus Christ.
