|description = A common avian species in Teyvat. Plump and meaty, but also capable of delivering messages.<br>This pure-white member of the pigeon family is especially friendly towards humans, but is also highly perceptive of humans' ill intent. Interesting trivia: There is a widely held belief in [[Mondstadt]] that an authentic [[Sweet Madame]] must be cooked using pigeon meat, but this is just a rumor and nothing more.
