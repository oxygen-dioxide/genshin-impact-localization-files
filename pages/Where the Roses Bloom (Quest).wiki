{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, we haven't seen Chevreuse since that night at [[Baptiste]]'s place...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, guess there's no point worrying about it now! Let's go join up with the others.

;(Approach the entrance to the [[Court of Fontaine: Court Region Waterway Hub|Court Region Waterway Hub]] from [[Vasari Passage]])
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Goooood morning! Ayaka and I were just talking about you!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Is Chevreuse... still not joining us today?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Probably not, we haven't seen her, either.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Huh? But that's such a pity... Director Furina said that we've only got a few small scenes left before wrapping up the entire thing!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' She even said that she'll get me into a couple scenes so everyone will have a chance to shine in front of the Kamera!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' We were also planning on having a victory feast once we're all finished filming. You can join us, right?
:{{DIcon}} Of course.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' If only Chevreuse was here... I still haven't taken a photo with her!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I'm afraid that can't be helped. Those Special Patrol folks are like phantoms when they've got a case on their hands.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But, to be honest, I am even more concerned by what I read in The Steambird earlier this morning. It said that... the killer in the murder case was none other than the author of "The Two Musketeers."
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, yeah, I heard about that too! He came over and confessed his crimes, but gave no explanation as to why he pulled the trigger.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' We didn't know about this case at all when we joined the film. Is it going to affect the reception of our work...?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' From a pure publicity standpoint, this will draw a lot more attention to our film. I have to say, though, that no director can be perfectly comfortable with garnering attention through means other than artistic skill.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' To be fair, I feel like that ship sailed the moment you allowed yourself to be named as the director on our posters.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It's not my fault that I'm super popular! What was that saying again? My popularity has&mdash;
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Sunk to an all-time low?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Spread to the four corners of Teyvat!
:;(In the southern parts of the [[Beryl Region]])<!--black screen transition-->
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Excuse me, everyone.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xavier! Feels like it's been ages since we last saw you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I've been talking non-stop with the Film Association and I'm absolutely swamped trying to coordinate the film's marketing, so forgive me for not being around more often... But please believe me when I say that I will make sure everyone's hard work gets the exposure it deserves!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Seems like you've been fighting your own battles!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Haha. Yes, that's one way to put it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Oh, and before we begin the final round of filming, please allow me to finally introduce you to...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' The original investor of our film, Mr. Morris.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 morris 01.ogg}} '''Morris:''' ...A pleasure to meet you all.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Yes. Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Morris. We've heard about the issues you've encountered with your financial situation, and genuinely hope that things have taken a turn for the better.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 morris 02.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Ah, well... the situation has indeed improved somewhat.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Don't worry, Mr. Morris! Accidents and last-minute challenges happen all the time. There's no need to blame yourself over it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' The good news is that we're almost done filming now, and I would even say that this is the best story I've ever seen!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 morris 03.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Is that so... I see, that's great news.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, now that we've gotten all the pleasantries out of the way, let's get this show on the road.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' We'll mostly be filming typical people and scenery from the streets today to improve the sense of environmental ambiance in some parts of the film.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, and there'll be a cameo for Mr. Kamisato and Miss Yoimiya as well. They'll be used to show outsider perspectives on the fates of the Two Musketeers.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' That's right. Ayato should be here any minute.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Excellent, then let's start with the scenery shots. Kamera and clapper loader, you're up.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, we'll be ready!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Remember, all we need are some wide zoom shots of the streets. If you happen to find some particularly lovely patches of flowers and grass, feel free to grab some close-ups of those as well.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ready? Lights, Kamera, ACTION!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Okay, now move the Kamera slowly.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Try to focus on that flower...
:;(The Kamera loses focus)
:{{DIcon}} (Take a close-up shot of the flower.)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm? What's wrong? Just adjust the focal length a bit.
:{{DIcon}} (Take a close-up shot of the flower.)
:;(The image jitters)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Something the matter?
:{{DIcon}} The Kamera seems to be broken...
:{{DIcon}} It's not responding like usual.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh!? But wasn't it working fine for all the days before?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Veronique! Can we try a different Kamera?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 veronique 01.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' No problem. How about this one?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, let's give it another try. Lights, Kamera, action!
:'''???:''' *mechanical malfunctioning noises*
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Don't tell me... This one is broken too!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Veronique, do we have any other spare ones we can use?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 veronique 02.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' Uh... I'm afraid we only brought these two today.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What!? Then go find a workshop to get them repaired right away! Oh, and you too, Bonnot. Go find our spare Kamera in the warehouse, and bring it back to the set!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 veronique 03.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' On it!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Greetings, everyone. My apologies for the delay. Hmm? Is something the matter, Ayaka?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' It seems like there are some issues with the filming equipment today. We're stuck for the moment...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' I see...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, let's not just stand here twiddling our thumbs. Actors, to the makeup booth. We'll start on the next scene as soon as we get a working Kamera.
:{{Black Screen|After some time, Veronique returns with a repaired Kamera...}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 veronique 04.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' The people at the workshop told me that the part which holds the lens in place seemed to have fallen off. That's super strange... It was perfectly fine just yesterday.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, no time to dwell on that now. Let's get back to filming.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 23.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Quiet on set! Places, everyone! Lights, Kamera, action!
:;(Filming starts)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''{{tt|Person Chatting in the Street|Played by Yoimiya}}:''' By the way, have you heard about that recent murder case?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayato 03.ogg}} '''{{tt|Person Chatting in the Street|Played by Kamisato Ayato}}:''' Yes, I have. It seems that they've caused quite the commotion in the city.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''{{tt|Person Chatting in the Street|Played by Yoimiya}}:''' I heard that the chief of the Gardes is so mad about not catching the culprit that he's about to explode!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayato 04.ogg}} '''{{tt|Person Chatting in the Street|Played by Kamisato Ayato}}:''' Oh? I find that quite hard to imagine, considering how he already looks most days...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 bonnot 01.ogg}} '''Bonnot:''' Director! Director!! We have a problem!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 24.ogg}} '''Furina:''' We're in the middle of a take! Couldn't you wait until we wrapped up this scene!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 bonnot 02.ogg}} '''Bonnot:''' No, Director, our film &mdash; all the finalized film that we've been keeping in the case has disappeared!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 25.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wait, what did you say!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...Mr. Bonnot, please take me to where the film was kept right away!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I'm coming, too!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 26.ogg}} '''Furina:''' No, Yoimiya! You have to stay here.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 27.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 28.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Okay, listen up. Everyone who's not working on this current scene can go with Bonnot to look for the film. Everyone else, stay put and wrap up the scene.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 29.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Unbelievable... How could all these problems happen in just one day?
:{{Black Screen|After some time...}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We're back.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 30.ogg}} '''Furina:''' How did it go? Did you find the film?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We found it in the sewers.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 31.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh! In the sewers!? Is the film still okay?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We discovered it just in time, so we should still be able to salvage it. The others are checking now to see if we lost any specific scenes.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 32.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Whew... You scared me for a moment there. I nearly thought we had lost everything...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 33.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I really don't want to experience that feeling of despair again.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, but who could have stolen the film and dumped it there?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 34.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Could it be... some competitors working on other films?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if they wanted to harass us, why wait until the last day?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 35.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Okay, we don't have time to really look into it right now. Let's strike while the iron is still hot, and wrap this thing up once and for all.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Let's finish it!
:{{Black Screen|Thanks to everyone's efforts, you finally wrap up the final scenes of the film...}}
:{{Black Screen|Even though unexpected situations and problems struck during the filming process, you were able to overcome them all...}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 36.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I would like to officially announce that our entry to the Festival, "The Two Musketeers," has now concluded filming!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... Paimon is spent. It's so late already...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 37.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Even though the filming process proved to be extremely challenging, everyone provided valuable and unique contributions to the final product. Thank you all for your dedication and support!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' And just like Director Furina, I would also like to extend my most heartfelt thanks to all of you. Really... you've all helped me so much. I just...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 38.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, alright, let's save the awards speech for later, and hopefully also get some rehearsals in before the real thing.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 2 furina 39.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Anyway, now it's time to party! Let's all make our way to the beach and have a celebration feast so loud and fun that even the [[Blubberbeast]]s will want in!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Party! Party! Paimon wants to party!!!

;(Approach the beach)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! This place is hopping! Everyone's finally getting to relax after wrapping up the film.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go chat with someone!

;(Talk to Yoimiya or Morris, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Have you ever seen a fireworks show, Mr. Morris? It's pretty amazing!
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 morris 01.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Hmm, I'm afraid I haven't... But I'll take your word for it.

;(Talk to Chiori, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' This is turning out to be quite the party...

;(Talk to Xavier, Bonnot, or Veronique, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I was thinking... If this film turns out to be a success, could I ask the two of you to stay and be a part of my crew?
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Of course, I'll definitely... increase the pay for next time!
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 bonnot 01.ogg}} '''Bonnot:''' I'd be more than happy to, Mr. Xavier.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 veronique 01.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' Thank you for the offer, Mr. Xavier, but I've made some plans to go on a journey to the other nations once the festival is over...
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Is that so... Well then, in that case, bon voyage, Miss Veronique. Please feel free to get in touch once you've returned to Fontaine.

;(Talk to Furina)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Furina!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, my darling clapper loader and Kamera operator! You've both worked really hard.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks you worked even harder than us! Honestly, Paimon was getting a little tired of playing with the clapperboard by the end of it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Worst of all, Paimon's started having dreams of you shouting "Lights, Kamera, ACTION!" into Paimon's ears! The actual dream can't even start until you've yelled that!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, if anything, shouldn't I be more grand and delightful in your dreams!? We've been through so much together and that's how your brain remembers me?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, that's... That's not Paimon's fault! We've just used the clapperboard too much lately...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Anyway, what's most important is that we've wrapped the film. I'm pretty confident that we'll take first prize!
:{{DIcon}} You mean, the Furina Award?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, no need to mention the official name!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, now that you mention it, if we did win the Prize, would Furina just get... a statue of herself?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Come on, I don't need that kind of attention. Xavier can accept the reward on our behalf.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But just imagine... Furina accepting the Furina Award, and holding a Furina statue...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 7 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...I'm going back to my dessert now. You all can keep discussing that on your own.

;(Talk to Furina again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm... What kind of dessert should I try next?

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayato or Kamisato Ayaka)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Ayato! How's your work been going?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Everything went rather smoothly. Thank you for your concern.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Ayato told me that we've already confirmed the dates for some Inazuma-Fontaine cultural exchange events.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' So the next time we visit, we'll be doing so in our capacities as the representatives of the Yashiro Commission.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, that's great! Then maybe Paimon will be able to find Fontaine detective novels in Inazuma from now on!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh wait... Wouldn't [[Yae Miko]] get upset if that happens? That would be stealing some of her business.
:{{DIcon}} As long as the novels are sufficiently interesting...
:{{DIcon}} I don't think she'll mind.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've got a point... She's always complaining that light novels have become bland and too predictable, after all.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' The cultural exchange won't only feature literatures of both nations, of course. We have also made plans for cross-cultural engagements in the fields of gourmet cuisine, toymaking, and artisan craftsmanship.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Paimon's getting super excited now!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 6 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' When the time comes, be sure to visit and participate in all the events.

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayaka or Kamisato Ayato again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Ah... I wish we could have spent some more time here.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Don't worry, it won't be long before we're back again.

;(Talk to Chiori)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chiori!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hey, you two.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you not really into these kinds of big social occasions?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Not particularly, but this is still better than [[Fontaine Fashion Week]].
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, but if this film becomes a big hit, people will definitely come flocking to your shop!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yes, that's highly likely... as long as the film can premiere as planned.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you still worried about the case?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That, and all the obstacles we had to face today.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, you're right... It's as if all our bad luck just manifested at once.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But why today, of all days...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No... No, it's nothing. We've already delivered the film to the editors, so there should be nothing more to worry about.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' How are you doing, Mr. Morris? You having a good time?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 morris 01.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Well... You could say that. Do you happen to know when the party is scheduled to end?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Haha, judging by how much fun everyone's having, I'd say probably not until well after midnight.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Is there something that you still have to take care of at home, Mr. Morris?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 morris 02.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Ah... I uh, I'm just not a late night person, so I might take off shortly.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh no! Silly me, I almost forgot something super important!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 morris 03.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Oh... Uh, what is it?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I prepared a whole batch of fireworks for the party, but I forgot to bring them over from the warehouse!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 morris 04.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Fireworks, you say? That's, uh, truly a pity. Sorry things didn't go as planned...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Could you help me carry them over, Mr. Morris? I won't be able to fetch all of them by myself...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 morris 05.ogg}} '''Morris:''' Me? Uh... Are you sure that you can't find anyone else?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Haha, I just wanted to make this a surprise for everyone! The warehouse isn't far from here. We'll be there in no time.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Pretty please, Mr. Morris! These are some of the best fireworks I've ever made, so I also want you to see them before you leave. They're stunning &mdash; I promise that they'll be an once-in-a-lifetime experience that you'll never forget!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 morris 06.ogg}} '''Morris:''' But...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' It's okay, just come with me! If we're sneaky enough, nobody else will see us leaving...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 9 morris 07.ogg}} '''Morris:''' *sigh* Oh, alright...

;(While entering the warehouse)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 10 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' The warehouse is right over here... I moved the fireworks there in advance, so it shouldn't be too much work bringing them back.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 10 morris 01.ogg}} '''Morris:''' ...It's still a ways away from the party.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 10 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hahaha, sorry 'bout that, Mr. Morris! It's probably because I'm used to carrying fireworks all the time, so it doesn't feel like a lot of work to me.

;(If the player approaches the beach)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 10 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Shh! Don't let anyone else see us! I still want it to be a surprise!

;(Enter the warehouse)
;(A [[#Gallery|cinematic]] plays)
::'''Yoimiya:''' Hmm? It's dark in here!
::'''Yoimiya:''' Wait here, Mr. Morris
::'''Yoimiya:''' I think the light switch should be somewhere over here...
:;(Yoimiya leaves, while Morris closes the door with a sigh)
::'''Morris:''' ...Ugh, why did I have to get roped into this...
:;(A gunshot rings out and Yoimiya screams)
::'''Morris:''' *gasp*! Wh&mdash;What was that!?
:;(Morris gropes around for the light switch and turns it on. Yoimiya lays lifelessly on the ground as a [[Rainbow Rose]] floats down and lands in front of her. Panicked, Morris bangs on the door)
::'''Morris:''' Who's there? Get me out!!! Get me outta here!!!
:;(Chevreuse, the muzzle of her musket still red and smoking from the shot, walks out from the darkness)
::'''Chevreuse:''' Did you really think you'd get away, Morris?
:;(Morris flees backwards as Chevreuse steadily approaches)
::'''Morris:''' You've got the wrong guy!
::'''Morris:''' It wasn't me, I&mdash;I'm not the killer!
::'''Chevreuse:''' You know, Elisa died a far more heroic death than this
::'''Chevreuse:''' She fought your assassin to the end
::'''Chevreuse:''' To save the children she had hidden beneath the floorboards
:;(Morris falls to the ground. A golden item is thrown onto the ground in front of him, which opens up to reveal a photo)
::'''Chevreuse:''' That is Elisa's pendant
::'''Chevreuse:''' The one with a photo of you two inside
:;(She advances before he can get a good look at the photo, causing him to scramble away)
::'''Chevreuse:''' The one you gave her
::'''Chevreuse:''' Ring any bells?
::'''Morris:''' I&mdash;It's a fake
::'''Morris:''' It has to be! There's no way&mdash;
::'''Chevreuse:''' ...No way your assassin didn't destroy it, you mean?
:;(Morris is backed into the wall and has nowhere to escape)
::'''Chevreuse:''' Did you ever love her, Morris?
::'''Chevreuse:''' Or was killing her always the plan?
::'''Morris:''' No no no, please, listen to me!
::'''Morris:''' I told Elisa to keep us a secret...
::'''Morris:''' I paid her plenty for her silence!
::'''Morris:''' I never thought she'd keep the child!
::'''Morris:''' Everything was gonna come out...
::'''Morris:''' And I had no choice, she forced my hand!
:;(An ominous click from the gun causes Morris to look up, and he finds the musket aimed straight at his head)
::'''Morris:''' No, I'm begging you...
::'''Morris:''' I have money...
::'''Morris:''' Just name your price, please!
::'''Chevreuse:''' You can keep your Mora
::'''Chevreuse:''' And you can go to hell
:;(Chevreuse pulls the trigger and Morris gasps)
::'''Morris:''' ...?
:;(Smoke emanates from the gun. The shot fired was a blank. Chevreuse puts the weapon away and steps into the light)
::'''Chevreuse:''' I'm Captain Chevreuse of the Special Patrol
::'''Chevreuse:''' Morris
::'''Chevreuse:''' You're under arrest for Elisa's murder
:;(A speechless Morris can only watch as Paimon, who has recorded the entire exchange, shows herself. The Traveler stands up from their position in the rafters. Defeated, Morris slumps against the wall)
::'''Veronique:''' Tch!
:;(Veronique shoots a real bullet at Morris, but Chevreuse blocks it with her actual musket as she whirls around and points her gun at Veronique)
::'''Chevreuse:''' You're under arrest, too
::'''Chevreuse:''' Prop Manager Veronique
:;(Traveler jumps down from the rafters next to Veronique, summoning their sword)
::'''Chevreuse:''' Or perhaps...
::'''Chevreuse:''' I should call you... "The Second Musketeer"?
:;(Chevreuse and Veronique face off, each pointing their musket at the other as Paimon is caught in the middle)
::'''Paimon:''' ...
:;(Cinematic ends)
:;(Yoimiya runs up to the scene)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Wait, what's going on? This wasn't in the script!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Drop the gun, Veronique!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 01.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...Why? Why would you keep me from exacting revenge on this heartless monster?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Drop your weapon! This is my final warning.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 02.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...
:;(Despite her hesitation, Veronique complies)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 01.ogg}} '''Morris:''' What... What is going on...?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Do I have to spell it out for you, Morris? Everything that took place just now was staged to get you to confess the truth.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But this last part is all improv, of course.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 03.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Chevreuse, you told us that you wanted us to help you stage a play, you never said anything about the "Second Musketeer"!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' It's because even I had no way to confirm my theory until now.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thank you for your performance, Yoimiya. Could I trouble you to go and bring in the other Special Patrol members? They should be on standby just outside.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Oh, and please tell the other cast members not to worry about us. We'll be rejoining them shortly.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' On it!
:;(After Yoimiya leaves, Chevreuse turns to Morris)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' So, what do you think, Morris? Care to talk about what happened twenty years ago?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 02.ogg}} '''Morris:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' My patience is limited, you know. Don't force me to take you back to the interrogation room... I'd wager that you wouldn't last for more than a minute in there.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' With the recording we made, you have no chance of winning in court. Cooperating with us now is the most practical move.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 03.ogg}} '''Morris:''' ...Alright, I'll talk.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 04.ogg}} '''Morris:''' I hired an assassin to murder Elisa.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 05.ogg}} '''Morris:''' She once worked as a maid on my family's estate. She was very beautiful, and after some time I fell for her.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 06.ogg}} '''Morris:''' We kept our relationship a secret, and carried out an affair for some time. But it wasn't long before she became pregnant.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 07.ogg}} '''Morris:''' If my parents ever found out, they would have stripped me of my inheritance and status, and driven me out of my home...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 08.ogg}} '''Morris:''' I also didn't expect Elisa to insist on bringing the pregnancy to term. She even asked me to leave my family, and travel far, far away with her.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 11.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' She believed that you were truly in love with her.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 09.ogg}} '''Morris:''' ...I didn't have a choice.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 10.ogg}} '''Morris:''' I gave her a large sum of Mora, told her to leave the family, and get rid of the baby.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 11.ogg}} '''Morris:''' But then years later, she sent me a letter. There were photos of two children, and she even asked if I could find some time to visit them...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Two children? Paimon thought Baptiste was the only... Ah! You mean...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Even if she had the children against your will, you could have just ignored her letter entirely. Why kill her?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 12.ogg}} '''Morris:''' I had just gotten engaged to be married to an heiress from another wealthy family, so if anyone were to find out about Elisa, my life would be completely ruined! I didn't have a choice!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 13.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' No... you always had a choice. You just made the wrong choice, again.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 13.ogg}} '''Morris:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 04.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...Do you know how it feels to watch your mother be killed right in front of you?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 05.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' My brother and I were hardly even school-age yet! We were hidden beneath the floorboards, grasping each other's hands like a lifeline. We were so terrified that we didn't even know when we could ever take a breath!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 06.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' All we could do was to watch mother try to fight back, and then... collapse to the floor...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 07.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' Even after the assassin left, we were still too terrified to leave our hiding spot. We thought that he might come back... It was only until the next evening when we finally climbed out and gathered around our mother.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 08.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' But she... had already become cold and stiff to the touch.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 14.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You made up your mind right then and there to bring this case to light.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 09.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' Not only that... we resolved to get our revenge.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 15.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' And that's why you became the musketeers.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 10.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' No, that's why I became a musketeer. The man from before was also killed by me. My brother had nothing to do with it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 16.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I figured as much.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 11.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...You did?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 17.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I once told these two that he didn't look like a killer to me. His confession from that night also rubbed me the wrong way.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 18.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I think what really tipped me off was... how could I not feel a sense of "regret" in him?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 12.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 19.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' He confessed faster than any criminal I've ever met, but he didn't say a single word about you. He insisted that he was the sole perpetrator in the case...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 20.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But after the questioning ended, I disassembled the musket we dug up from his backyard, put it in front of him, and told him to reassemble it. Wanna guess how far he got?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 13.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 21.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' He had no idea where to even start. He's never touched a gun in his life.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 22.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Based on that, I determined that he was not acting alone. He only surrendered himself to draw our attention and create a moment of opportunity for his partner. So, I decided to play along.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 23.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' And as expected, the second musketeer followed us without hesitation once she saw Morris get separated from the rest of the cast.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 24.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Besides, why else would he call the novel "The TWO Musketeers"?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... How did you know it was Veronique?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 25.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I figured it out the moment Baptiste told me his father's name.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 26.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' That so-called "financial crisis" was all just a ruse. He just wanted to sign up as the investor, and then leave the film without any source of funding.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 27.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' After all, he has a vested interest in minimizing the reach of this story. It's really just the same thing as what he did to Elisa all those years ago.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 14.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...Human scum.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 28.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But then Xavier pulled out all the stops and got the film made, against all odds. Morris couldn't have that.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 29.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' With the killer in custody, he figured it was safe to act. And so he came to visit the set today, just as I expected.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... so you were behind all those mishaps today!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 14.ogg}} '''Morris:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 30.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' As for the identity of the second musketeer... I assumed they'd probably stay close to Morris, and look for an opening.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 31.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' And if they already knew that Morris was the film's investor, then that narrowed the list of potential suspects as well.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 32.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Furthermore, being the props manager would allow the culprit to avoid scrutiny by purchasing mechanical parts in the name of the crew.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 33.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' With that hypothesis in mind, I went back to check Baptiste's orphanage adoption records. Guess whose name I saw on the same page, just a few lines from his?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 15.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 16.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' My brother... He trusted you...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 34.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 35.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' As in, he trusted me to perform the deed on his behalf?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 17.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' He trusted you to stand on the side of justice!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 36.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I am.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 18.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' I thought you could do it as well! The look on your face when you told him to go to hell... I really thought you'd put a bullet in his brain!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 37.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 19.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' You know what he has done. Are you telling me that you'd rather see him spend the rest of his life living like a king in the [[Fortress of Meropide]]!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 20.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' I will never be able to forget the feeling of my mother's cold, lifeless hands... And you would call this ending fair? Is this what you call justice!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 38.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 39.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I won't lie, Veronique. I did hesitate when your brother first told me about the truth...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 40.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I wondered... I agonized over whether I should really put a bullet in his head.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 21.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' So why don't you...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 41.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Because that should never be how justice is carried out in this world!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 42.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Perhaps, to you justice is simply reciprocated: an eye for an eye, and a life for a life.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 43.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But everyone has their own understanding of justice. If everyone were to pursue their own definition of it, there would be no more order in this world.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 44.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Today, you'll kill Morris. And tomorrow? His children may come for you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 45.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The world cannot render judgments based on a desire for revenge. That will only lead to a cycle of revenge, as well as the destruction of order and civilized society.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 46.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Fontaine is founded on a set of laws and a standardized code of justice. That is why we are the Nation of Justice.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 47.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But with all that said, I will promise you this: Morris will not lead a cushy life in the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Chevreuse, the rest of the Special Patrol is here.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 48.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thank you so much, Yoimiya. [[Letellier]], [[Turenna]], please take them away.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 morris 15.ogg}} '''Morris:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 22.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' ...I still can't agree with your reasoning.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 49.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...I know.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 veronique 23.ogg}} '''Veronique:''' Justice has not been delivered. At least... not today.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 50.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chevreuse...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 51.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Let's go. We should give an explanation to the crew.
:{{DIcon}} Are you okay?
:{{DIcon}} I think you made the right call.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 52.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thank you for your concern. I'm fine.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 11 chevreuse 53.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I'm just thinking... About the things in life that have driven people to take justice into their own hands.
:{{Black Screen|You explain everything that happened to the rest of the crew...}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Who would have thought Morris would turn out to be... Ugh, I'm at a loss for words. How could he have done something like this!?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I'm just glad that you are all safe and sound. Who knew that such a labyrinth of cases would be behind this story...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Well... what should we do now? We have a finished film, of course, but... Should we still go ahead with the premiere?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' What do you mean!? Shouldn't you be even more motivated to spread the word now that you've learned the truth?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Chiori is right. I'd also like more people to see this story for themselves.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' But the real ending of the story seems to have deviated somewhat from the one in the script. Is that still acceptable to you, Miss Chevreuse?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The call is yours. We still have time to re-shoot an ending if that's what you'd like.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...No, it's fine as-is. I like what we have for the catharsis.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Romanticism is what gives works of art their appeal. Fiction is able to explore means of restitution that could never work in real life.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Just like the real world, the world of stories also has its own set of "rules" and "justice." These different possibilities are what initially drew me to reading in the first place.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Sounds good to me! I support your decision.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' What about Veronique... will she be okay?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' She will soon face her judgment alongside her brother and Morris.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' If I had to guess, they'll probably all be sent to the Fortress of Meropide. I'll make sure to give [[Wriothesley]] a heads-up about it.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh, you mean, "that" kind of heads-up?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Exactly.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahem, alright! Then the matter's settled! Now that everything's been taken care of, there's no reason for us to keep looking all gloomy and grumpy.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Let's get back to the feast and enjoy each other's company. We'll be starting the post-production process tomorrow.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You should join us, Chevreuse. You missed the first few hours of the party, didn't you?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Alright, count me in.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Then I'll wait for you over there. There's still some good news that I'd like share with Chevreuse.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon? Could you wait for me by the sea after the party ends? I'd like to go on a brief walk with the two of you.
:{{DIcon}} Absolutely.
:{{DIcon}} See you then.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 11.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thank you very much.
:;(The party continues)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Sorry for the wait.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we weren't waiting long at all! Is there something else you wanted to tell us?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 13.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' No, I don't have anything new to share. I just felt that... since you were my investigation partners, I should have another conversation with the two of you.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 14.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 15.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' {{Traveler}}... how would you have responded to Baptiste's request if you were in my shoes?
:{{DIcon}} I would have done the same as you.
::{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 16a 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Is that so... Thanks for sharing.
:{{DIcon}} I would have helped him get his revenge.
::{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 16b 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Hah... Just like the protagonist of the story, huh. Can't say it doesn't suit you.
:{{DIcon}} I don't know...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 17.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...When I was young, my father often took me here to swim. We'd come, rain or shine, even when it was freezing cold.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 18.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' He told me that swimming was the best activity to train one's strength of will. You could never give up before reaching the shore... especially when the water was cold.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Why's that?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 19.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Because the moment you give up would be the moment you die. At that point, I still hadn't received my Vision.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 20.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' One winter, the chilly wind felt almost like knives on my skin, and the seawater was so frigid that it numbed my toes the moment I stepped in.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 21.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I cried and begged my father to spare me from having to swim across, but he wouldn't listen. He used to be a member of the Special Patrol as well... You could say it was his way of educating his children.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds awful...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 22.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' When he saw that I wouldn't stop crying, he just picked me up, and tossed me into the icy water.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 23.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The bone-chilling cold took away my senses. I couldn't feel anything but fear and rage...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 24.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I waited for my father to save me, but one look and I knew he'd already started swimming for the opposite shore. I realized that if I were to give up, I really would die right then and there.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 25.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I used all of my strength to try and catch up to my father. Those few minutes felt longer than my whole life up until that point. I did, however, make it to the other side.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 26.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I've never felt afraid about anything in my life after that, nor have I ever cried again.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That way of teaching would have never worked on Paimon...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 27.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yeah, I don't think that was the right method for anyone...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 28.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' It's just that... working now as I am in the pursuit of justice, I still sometimes feel like I've been tossed into that winter sea all over again. The anger and the helplessness...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chevreuse...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 29.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But the worse I feel, the more I know to never give up. The alternative would be to forever lose myself among the waves.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 chevreuse 30.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Anyway, how about a race? Neither of us will drown, but we can still see who swims faster?
:{{DIcon}} I'm game.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Er... You guys go ahead! Paimon will grab the clapperboard to mark the start of the race...

;(Approach the other shore)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 14 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Whoa, that felt good!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were so fast in the water, Chevreuse... You were swimming even faster than Paimon could fly!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, about the Special Patrol... Did you join because of your dad?
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 14 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Partly, but I'd say I was more inspired the heroes I read about in stories growing up.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so it's due to your love of stories...
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 14 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Of course, it was only after I joined the Special Patrol that I learned that truth is often stranger than fiction.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 14 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...Come on, let's walk a bit more.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 15 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' To be honest, I do sometimes question whether the decisions I make are the right ones.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 15 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But I know that no matter what, I must keep swimming.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 15 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Because the only thing I've got my eyes on is the shore in the distance.

;(Approach Chevreuse after she finishes her walk)
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 16 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thank you for coming on this walk with me. I feel a lot better after getting all that off my chest.
:{{DIcon}} You're welcome.
:{{DIcon}} Anytime.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? We're nearly back at Baptiste's house!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 16 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Huh, you're right. I didn't realize we were so close.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He really did plant a lot of flowers. It's just like how he described it in the story.
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 16 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' *gasp* Wait. Paimon, {{Traveler}}, look!
:{{A|vo dyjeq004 16 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The Rainbow Roses in the garden... They're in full bloom now.

==Post-Quest Dialogue==
After completing this quest, Chevreuse can be found in the open world.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Chevreuse near [[Baptiste]]'s house)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Even though it's a bit late, I must thank you for investigating this case with me.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Not on behalf of the Special Patrol this time &mdash; it's a personal expression of gratitude from yours truly.
:{{DIcon}} About your family...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03a 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Ah, you want to hear more about my father?
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03a 2.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' To be honest, I didn't spend that much time with him. He was always busy with the Special Patrol, so he would often return home really late at night. Some nights, he didn't come home at all.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03a 3.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Once, he didn't come home for a long time. Maybe a whole week or so.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03a 4.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' When I went out to buy food, I learned that he had become a criminal, and by extension, that made me a criminal's daughter.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03a 5.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But we can talk about that another day.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the case...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03b 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I actually have a lot of sympathy for Veronique and Baptiste. I can understand the hatred they feel for their father...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03b 2.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But that doesn't mean I'll allow them to walk the path of evil, even if it might lead to another sense of justice.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the film...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03c 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Films are different from the real world. They are a form of art and represent the wishes in people's hearts.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03c 2.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I adore "The Two Musketeers," and I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to act the role as one.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03c 3.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I can't wait to catch the film when it premieres in the opera house. I'm looking forward to seeing the audience's reaction to the climactic ending.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Please take care...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq004 chevreuse 03d 1.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Thank you for looking out for me. I'll see you at the award ceremony &mdash; I'd be very surprised if we don't win.
