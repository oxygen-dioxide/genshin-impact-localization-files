{{Description|A flower born of the minerals and rocks of cliffside cracks. The way its petals blow in the wind makes it seem alive.}}
'''Flower of Creviced Cliff''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Archaic Petra]].

==Description==
A flower bloomed in a cliff's impregnable cleft.<br />It is an exquisite life shaped by the essence of Geo.

There is a folk saying that goes thus:<br />In times of yore, someone told the Lord of Geo that there was no life to be found in barren stone.<br />Thus did the Lord of Geo command flowers of purest gold to burst forth from the face of an uneven rock.

Perhaps the Geo Archon did once work such a great wonder.<br />Or perhaps this is but one of the many tales that shroud this ancient world.<br />But the prosperous harbor that grew out of the lifeless mountains,<br />And that braves the raging waters of the Sea of Clouds—<br />Perhaps that was the brilliant flower, after all.
