{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Rie:''' Hello there, friend from afar. Are you going shopping?
:'''Rie:''' As it happens, I'm doing so too. Would you mind if I join you?
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me more about this street?
::'''Rie:''' This street is the busiest place in Inazuma. Not only can you get the daily necessities here, but you can also purchase rare, high-end, and exotic goods. It's my favorite spot.
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Rie:''' It's a shame that you've come at such a moment. If it were before the [[Sakoku Decree]], you would even be able to find fine liquor from [[Mondstadt]] or handcrafted jewelry from [[Liyue]].
:::'''Rie:''' Now, I would recommend that you check out the old local stores, like Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. You will even find the latest and finest outfits there.
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Rie:''' If you're new, I would recommend that you check out the old local stores, like Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. You will find the latest and the finest outfits there.
::'''Rie:''' [[Yayoi Nanatsuki|The owner]] of [[Yayoi Lacquerware]] seems to have lived abroad before. She can perform craftsmanship that would otherwise be unique to [[Sumeru]].
::'''Rie:''' There's also [[Netsuke no Gen Crafts]]... and [[Uyuu Restaurant]]...
::'''Rie:''' If you have already seen every corner of this street, you can also check [[Hanamizaka]] out... However...
::{{DIcon}} However...?
:::'''Rie:''' Ah, don't get me wrong. Hanamizaka is also a fine place to check out. You can go to [[Yae Publishing House]] to buy a novel, have a fine meal at [[Kiminami Restaurant]]... That would already make for a leisurely day indeed.
:::'''Rie:''' However, I heard rumors that there was [[Arataki Itto|a weirdo]] with a pair of long horns frequenting Hanamizaka...
:::'''Rie:''' I've heard that this man is very mean and overbearing, so much so that even Madam [[Kujou Sara]] from the [[Tenryou Commission]] considers him a headache.
:::'''Rie:''' But I've also heard it said that this weird man is not a thug. He just hangs out with the children all day, playing card games or setting up a bug-fighting arena...
:::'''Rie:''' I'm not sure if I should buy into any of these rumors... Anyway, if you happen to find yourself there, it's best to be a bit more careful.
::{{DIcon}} You're really familiar, aren't you?
:::'''Rie:''' Indeed. I have all the spare money in the world but nothing to do with it, so shopping is my greatest hobby. My family also runs a business, so I check the market regularly to stay informed.
:::'''Rie:''' Oh, right. If you find anything interesting while checking the market out, remember to let me know.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Rie:''' Bye. This place is worth your time, I guarantee it.
