==Request Details==
===Request from Ikuhara Gai===
Help Needed:<br />
That was close! Several days ago, I stumbled into monster territory while searching for ores.<br />
An icicle out of nowhere nearly knocked me right out, and I barely escaped... I would greatly appreciate it if someone could clear those {{Color|buzzword|monsters}} out, or they'll be the end of my peaceful ore-mining days for sure!
