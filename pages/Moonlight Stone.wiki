|description    = The story goes that a poet climbed to a great height on a moonlit night and saw the moonlight reflecting off the mountain rocks. Impressed by their immaculate, jade-like beauty, he called them "Moonlight Stone." From then on, this name became one of the many poetic terms for mountain rocks used by the people of [[Liyue]].
