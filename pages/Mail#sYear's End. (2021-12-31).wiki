|text    = Before I had even noticed, it is now the last day of the year.

It's a rather special day, which not only marks the end of one year, but the beginning of another. I dwell in contemplation every time this day comes.

Time, history... Everything that flows in this world comes together in the last moment of this day.

Whether strong waves or a trickle... They move on undeterred.

You've certainly been to a lot of places and done many things this year. Your presence is like a clear mirror on the earth.

A mirror can reveal a person's nature, reflect highs and lows of emotions, and illuminate the souls of heaven and earth.

On this special day, I too would like to see this world's mirror.

For someone who has journeyed for a long time, perhaps it is time to pause and take a break. If you are available, I hope we can meet up.

Conversation over tea will be sure to lift your spirits.
