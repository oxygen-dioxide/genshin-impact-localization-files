<span style="color:orange;">To the battle-hardened connoisseurs of fine wines and fighting arts:</span><br />
The fine wines meticulously brewed at the Dawn Winery have always quenched people's thirst for the finest liquor. Furthermore, the tax revenues generated by the Winery along amounted to 11.4%* of the annual expenditure of the [[Knights of Favonius]] last year. We are grateful for your patronage and proud to support Mondstadt and its people.<br />
But the prosperity we enjoy today may be at risk.<br />
In recent years, the number of wild monsters has dropped considerably under the repression of the Knights of Favonius. The lives and property of people have been safeguarded, but wildlife has proliferated inordinately due to the lack of natural predators.<br />
Although the Winery has made it its highest priority to secure the vineyard, an average of 10 or more <span style="color:orange;">vines are uprooted by boars</span> every week. If this situation persists, the yield of our vineyard will decrease dramatically.

As such, the Dawn Winery is looking for skilled fighters like you, who aspire to preserve Mondstadt and its fine wines:<br />

==Descriptions==
{{Description|The tavern is established and funded by the long-standing Dawn Winery. According to Charles the bartender, a small portion of the liquor in cellars would be absorbed by their barrels and also evaporated during distillation, so the brewers often refer to this lost portion as "the share of angels." Thus, the tavern's name: Angel's Share.|[[Map]] description}}

==Lore==
Angel's Share was opened by the [[Dawn Winery]] and once held a monopoly over Mondstadt's wine industry. However, since [[Diona]] was hired as bartender for [[Cat's Tail]], the rival tavern has become a challenger overnight &mdash; but still sees less sales than Angel's Share.

The tavern occasionally hosts an academy to teach interested prospects about the art of bartending. Initially it was meant to serve all types of drinks, but after an incident in which one of the attendees mixed a drink with three hard liquors, the session is now restricted to non-alcoholic drinks only.<ref>Event: [[Of Drink A-Dreaming]]</ref>

==Trivia==
*Angel's Share is real-world {{w|Angel's share|wine brewers' slang}}, with the same meaning that is used in the game.
