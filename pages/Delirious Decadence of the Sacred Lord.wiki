|description = It is said that the controversial mastermind who later came to be known as the [[Sacred Lord]] of the [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|ineffable city]] was once imprisoned. The [[Xbalanque|first human to ascend]], who at the time had not yet attained divine form, showed him great compassion.<br>Thus, after emerging from the mighty wing-shadows of a [[Dragon|once-great race]], he was accepted by the tribe who had once been his.<br>Since then, he has concealed his true visage beneath a mask, hiding the golden patterns that mark it, and resolved to offer up everything to the master who holds his vow.
