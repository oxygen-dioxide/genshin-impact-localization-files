{{Quest Description|"The [[Wanderer|Hero]] from another world, supported by their companions, shall restore peace to this world..."

Thus would epics of later generations speak of this time:<br>Thus was the fell dragon saved, thus was peace restored to Simulanka.<br>The people then lived happily ever after with the cute little dragon named "Durin."<br>Annoyed comment in the margins: Hey, you're not even bothering to rhyme anymore!}}

;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's been a while since our last adventure! Paimon wonders how Mini Durin is getting along in Simulanka.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go to the Forest of Blessings and take a look!

;(Approach the Calligraphy Tavern)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 alpaca 01.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' Here's your two Magic Tonics!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Why, thank you, young lady. And might I add that you're looking quite lovely today. ...Jean, come on, take a seat and let's have a drink. I ordered one for you as well.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' *sigh* But is this really appropriate? I mean...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Still worried about Klee? Relax, Albedo's with her. She'll be fine.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaeya and Master Jean! What are you two doing here?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oho, look who it is! {{Traveler}} and Paimon. You must be the "pleasant surprise" that Miss Alice told us about.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Greetings to you both. This is one place I didn't expect to run into you two.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The locals here have been talking non-stop about some brave heroes who saved the world... Let me guess, you two have been up to your old tricks?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not just us, we only played a small part! You could say we were two members of the Hero's adventure team.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Still sounds mighty impressive to me! As ever, our Honorary Knight is making us proud wherever they roam.
:{{DIcon}} Did I hear you talking about Alice and Klee?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' That's right. We received a letter of invitation from Miss Alice, proposing that we take Klee for a vacation in fairyland when work dies down.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I wasn't sure what she meant by "fairyland" at first, but if my eyes are not deceiving me, she was being quite literal.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Klee ran off excitedly as soon as we arrived. I'm a little worried about her, but Albedo insisted he would look after her while we do our own thing.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' We could hardly say no to such a considerate offer. So I took it upon myself to bring Jean to the nearest tavern we could find.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Any excuse to go for a drink, huh...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, well, we are on vacation. It's only fair that we get to indulge ourselves a little.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' ...You're right. I should make an effort to relax and unwind. It's what Miss Alice would want, after all.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Oh! Wait... Kaeya, what exactly did you order from the bar?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The House Special, of course. Best way to get a taste of the local culture.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pff...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hmm? Why are you making that face, Paimon?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... n&mdash;nothing... Paimon's just perpetually amused by your lifestyle, that's all. Go on, drink up.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 11.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hmm...? Something tells me I need to tread carefully here... Let's see, it's got a lovely color, but how about the taste? ... *cough* *splutter*
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehehehe...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' ...I think maybe I'll pass. But it's such a shame to waste it...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 12.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Alright, Paimon. Well played.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... Paimon got burned too, if that's any consolation. It's nothing personal!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 13.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh, by the way, we weren't the only ones who got invited here. I saw Collei earlier. She didn't see me though &mdash; she was making a beeline for that big tree.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Kingdom of Breezes and Bells, you mean? Oh, this is turning into a huge reunion! Maybe we should go say hi to her?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 kaeya 14.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Alright. Well, give her my regards.
:{{DIcon}} Will do.
:{{DIcon}} Enjoy your vacation!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 2 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Thank you. Enjoy your time here too.

;(Talk to Citrus, Jean, or Kaeya again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So the "Magic Tonic" here is just writing ink... What a weird and wonderful world.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Ah, Miss Citrus &mdash; do you happen to serve any beverages here that don't contain Magic Tonic?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 alpaca 01.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' Of course we do. What flavor would you like?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hmm, Sunsettia? Jean, you want in?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' ...Sure, I'll have the same please.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 alpaca 02.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' Sounds good! Two sunsettia drinks, coming right up!
----
;(Approach Collei)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' The structure of the tree houses here is nothing short of amazing! I have to write it down, so I can tell Master Tighnari all about it later...
:{{Introductory Note|Collei}}
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Collei!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Agh!! You scared me... {{Traveler}} and Paimon? You got invited here, too?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! ...Well, they sorta skipped the invitation part, but... Anyway, whatcha doing out here? Something caught your eye?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, yeah, I'm trying to observe and summarize the structures of the trees here, and also the animals that live here &mdash; well, the residents, I guess? I still can't get over the fact that they're all someone's origami handiwork!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Once a forest ranger, always a forest ranger, huh? Not sure you'll be able to apply much of what you learn here back home, though, with this being a magical world and everything...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh? Over there, by the giant footprint, have those houses always been there?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, those? The local flying squirrels told me that they were built by a small dragon and some guy wearing a hat.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! That must have been Mini Durin and Hat Guy! Any idea where they went?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Supposedly, after building the houses, they went to somewhere called, uh... Constellation Metropole? Did I say that right?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, you got it! Oh, also... When the locals mentioned the dragon, did they seem at all, uh... Did they say how they felt about him at all?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm... Now that you mention it, the atmosphere changed a little when they talked about him...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' They mentioned some stuff along the lines of "past misunderstandings" and "welcoming new members"...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I only just got here, so I know very little about what has happened in the past. They seemed genuinely grateful for the houses, though, and said they were going to plan a welcome party.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, thank goodness, phew... Sounds like the Forest has begun to accept him. It's a step in the right direction!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Are you looking for that small dragon?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, he's a new friend we made after we arrived here.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' No way! Really? I'm getting more and more interested in your story!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ugh... No, no, no, I've got to save it for next time. For now, I've got to make the most out of my time in this wonderful world!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, there's no rush! Just take it slow and enjoy yourself &mdash; like Kaeya. Oh, he sends his regards by the way.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, Mr. Kaeya is here too? Then... I've got to go say hi to him!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, right now he's at the tavern, and he probably won't be leaving until he's drunk... Hmm, not that he'll ever reach that point since his alcohol tolerance is so high... Basically, it's Kaeya &mdash; you know where to find him!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 13.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Haha, you make a good point, Paimon. Then I'll focus on exploring for now, and go catch up with him later!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shall we go pay a visit to the Metropole, {{Traveler}}? Maybe Mini Durin and Hat Guy are still there.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 14.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh right, by the way, something pretty interesting has been happening in Sumeru recently. Master Tighnari has been working really hard on it, so if you have time, definitely go check it out!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds good! We'll find some time in our schedule.
:{{DIcon}} Take it easy, Collei!
:{{DIcon}} Enjoy your... field trip!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 3 collei 15.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Of course! See you later!

;(Talk to Collei again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' The origami squirrels rely on wind currents to lift their agile bodies and easily move between the trees... This has created a truly unique ecosystem.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh no... I'm running out of pages on my notebook...
----
;(Approach Mona)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' What!? Are my eyes deceiving me?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' There is no way... I can't believe it...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Mona! We heard you muttering from a long way away! What's up?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is your scryglass acting up again?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Oh, it's you, the saviors of this world. My scryglass is fine. But I'm not sure I can say the same about my eyes...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Look. Look at this statue.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...What, is it broken or something? Looks fine to Paimon... That's your master, right? AKA, the "Goddess of Prophecy"?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I refuse to believe it! There's no way that old hag looks like anything like this.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe she did when she was younger.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' When she was younger? Oh, actually... Now that you mention it, this does remind me of the fashionista phase she wrote about in her diary...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...She can't hear me, can she? I swear, I just got chills down my spine...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Either way, it's probably a little rude to talk about her right under her statue.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But how did you know it's a statue of her if you never saw her as a young woman?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I did a quick scry when I came into this world, and when I saw the stars' reflections, I was at a loss for words... It looks like fate in Simulanka is directly based on Teyvat.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' A projection of real-world fate, to form an image of reality...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Or in layman's terms... basically, the creator made this world inside a mirror, or a lake, and this world is the reflection.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still sounds pretty impressive.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 11.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The more I scried, the more familiar everything looked... It's her work, there's no doubt about it. Even so, everything's far more complex than I'd imagined. Trying to decipher it all is giving me quite a headache.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 12.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I also asked the locals about her. They call her: "She who has dominion over the stars and the course of fate itself"... Not even a pretense of humility. Clearly, she let the role of creator-goddess get to her head...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 13.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Not that I'm surprised in the least, of course. It certainly matches {{sic|the the}} tone of her diary... Ahem, anyway! We should change the topic.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So Mona, have you seen a small dragon around by any chance? He's about the same size as Paimon, but with tiny little wings.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 14.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Ah, you mean the one that caused all that trouble? I haven't seen him for myself, but I heard that he came to the Metropole not long ago to formally apologize for his actions. Apparently, he brought a huge stash of toytanium and plant oil to make amends.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 15.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Most people accepted his apology, although there are some who said that they'll reserve judgment until they've seen how he acts in the future.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, okay... Do you know where we can find him?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 16.ogg}} '''Mona:''' One moment...
:;(Mona uses her hydromancy)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 17.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Ah, it looks like he's at the Broken Sea. There's a big group of people with him, too.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool! Wanna come with us? We can introduce you.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 18.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Hmm, I think I'll sit this one out. This might be the closest I ever get to meeting the Old Hag in her youth, so I think I'll spend some time seeing what else I can glean from her grand design. You guys have fun.
:{{DIcon}} ...Be careful, Mona.
::{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 19a 1.ogg}} '''Mona:''' What do you mean, "be careful"? Now you're making me nervous!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your astrological assistance.
::{{A|vo yqeq304 4 mona 19b 1.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Anytime.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll be off now. See you later, Mona!

;(Talk to Mona again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' (Creating a whole world's starscape is no easy task...)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' (Old Hag... I guess you do deserve the title of Trismegistus after all.)
----
;(Approach Wanderer and Mini Durin)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Ozvaldo Hrafnavins... Dost thou see what I am seeing? Tell me that my all-perceiving Auge der Verurteilung deceiveth me not!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Your eyes see true, Mein Fräulein.
:{{Introductory Note|Fischl}}
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 fischl 02.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Very well. Then, as sovereign ruler of the Immernachtreich, I extend to you both my greetings, O Night Dragon from the Land of the Thousand Stars, and his hat-wearing servant.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Who did you just call a servant?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 oz 02.ogg}} '''Oz:''' What Mein Fräulein means to say is, "Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you."
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 01.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Pleasure to meet you too! But Hat Guy's not my servant, he's my friend.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Now you're over-explaining.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hat Guy, Mini Durin! Found you at last! Whoa, and Fischl's with you, too?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 fischl 03.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Ohoho! Greetings, Outlander blessed by the Immernachtreich! How honored you are to meet your Prinzessin beneath the stars of another sky... Clearly, a decision made by fate itself!
:{{DIcon}} I echo your sentiments, Your Highness.
:{{DIcon}} It's great to see you too.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 01b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight! Paimon!
:{{Introductory Note|Klee}}
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Greetings. You both look well.
:{{Introductory Note|Albedo}}
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there Klee! Have you been having fun here?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yep, loads and loads of fun! There are soooo many cute animals! And a magic train that was reeeeally long! And a huge, huge castle, and a king lives there and everything!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I've been taking Klee to see all the sights. It's been a very enriching experience. Alice's magic is truly outstanding.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yeah, Mom's amazing! Klee wants to build a great big house now, too!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 02.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' So... Your mom and my mom... were friends?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mhm! Our moms were friends, which makes you my big brother! My mom used to read your mom's stories to me all the time, they were great!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 03.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' ...Big brother?
:{{DIcon}} You're part of the family now!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 04.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Wow... Thank you, Klee! Can I go play with Klee, Hat Guy?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Suit yourself.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Albedo, Albedo, can I&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Go on &mdash; just don't go too far away. I'll come pick you up later.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yey! C'mon Mini Durin! Do you wanna come play with us too, Fischl?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 fischl 04.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hehehe! Your Prinzessin accepts your invitation. Rejoice! Though you may be concealed by fog, still you shall have the good fortune to witness the true might of the Auge der Verurteilung!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 oz 03.ogg}} '''Oz:''' What Mein Fräulein means to say is, perhaps we can all play hide-and-seek together. Mein Fräulein is "it."
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hooray! I love hide-and-seek!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 05.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Me too!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' To return to our previous discussion, Mr. Hat Guy, you were telling me about a prophecy?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' I heard B talking to M. What she said was...
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 b 01.ogg}} '''"B":''' Since you're so persistent, let me tell you a secret...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 b 02.ogg}} '''"B":''' R's child... will one day rise from the dead.
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Is she saying that... Dragonspine-[[Durin]] will come back to life!?
:{{DIcon}} I'm shocked...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 05.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' I only heard it in a memory. So don't hold me to it.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Understood. My recent observations at Dragonspine lend credence to this prophecy as well.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Durin's heart has slowly but surely been growing in vitality. The process is extremely slow, but the trend is clear...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah... What should we do?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' To start with, plan for every potential scenario. Including, of course, the worst-case scenario...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 06.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I am well aware of Durin's past, and I sincerely hope that things never escalate to that point. Still, we need to be prepared for every possibility.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 09.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If the prophecy is true, and Durin's heart will one day beat again... I'd like to hope that whatever rises from the dead is no "evil dragon."
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 10.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If you understand what I mean.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kind of...? But not really.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 11.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' And so... When the time comes, Mr. Hat Guy, will you and Simulanka's Durin be willing to lend us a hand in our hour of need?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 07.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Huh? What's this got to do with me?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 12.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You saved the Durin of this world. I don't see that as a mere coincidence.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 13.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If there is any meaning to be read into the actions of the three Goddesses beyond fairytale whimsy alone, I can only boldly speculate that...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 14.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...The fate of this reflected world may have a reciprocal effect upon our own world.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 15.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If Durin of Dragonspine will soon come back to life, we will need Mini Durin's help... as well as yours, given that your fates are now intertwined.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 08.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Well, that's a nuisance.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 16.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' To be sure. It certainly won't be easy.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Albedo, Albedo! There's a flying paper ship over there! Can we go see it together, pleeease?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 17.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Sure. Two seconds, I'll be right with you.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 18.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Please give my suggestion some thought, Mr. Hat Guy.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 09.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 06.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Hat Guy, I'm back! ...Hmm? What were you guys talking about?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 10.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Nothing.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 07.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Huh? Okay then. Let's go join the others. Everyone's going to check out the new origami ship!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 11.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...Alright. I'll be right there.
:{{DIcon}} {{Wanderer}}...
:{{DIcon}} Are you worried about Durin?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 12.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Why would I be? Do I strike you as someone who cares about other people's issues?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Now that he's saved Simulanka's Durin, maybe he'll be sympathetic to the Durin of our world...?)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 13.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Quit trying to guess what I'm thinking. I'm leaving.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Hmm, Albedo was right. He needs time to think about it for himself.)
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Aww! What a lovely little boat!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 08.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' The Forest Fairy helped us make it!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon just realized, there's a lot fewer people around the Broken Sea now. Guess most of them have made their way back to the Metropole.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 10.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Does this boat have a name? I can't see one anywhere!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 09.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Huh...? A name?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 11.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mhm! Every boat has a name! At least, all the ones I've seen before.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 19.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' They're usually symbolic names that represent something aspirational.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 10.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 14.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 15.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Let's go with "The Durin."
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 11.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Huh? You want to name it after me?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! You mean, to wish Mini Durin a safe voyage as he sails into a new chapter of his life beyond this world?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 fischl 05.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Your Prinzessin approves. Let this vessel bear the name of the most esteemed dragon of the night.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 12.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' "The Durin"... Hehe, let's call it that, then! Thank you, Hat Guy!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 13.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Also... Can I ask you a favor?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 16.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...Go on.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 14.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Remember how Mom's friend said I should be able to leave this world? Well... I want to pay a visit to your world. Just a quick trip! Can we?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 17.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 15.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' ...I&mdash;Is that a no?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks that's a great idea. If the people of Simulanka are allowed to go to Teyvat, then what's the problem with taking Mini Durin there for a visit?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 18.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...I'm assuming I'll have to be your bodyguard while we're there?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 16.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' I... I can protect myself! And I'll do what you say, I won't fly off on my own, I promise! Please, can I go?
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 19.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 20.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...It'll be up to you to stick close. If you disappear on me, don't expect me to come looking.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 17.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Got it! I'll stick close!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 albedo 20.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Why don't you take The Durin? Now you've given it a name, it'll be a maiden voyage for the boat and a brand-new journey for you.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 klee 12.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Are you leaving, Mini Durin? Okay... Well, make sure you come visit me in Mondstadt so we can play together again! Klee will draw you a map to show you the way.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 fischl 06.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Though our time together has been as fleeting as a ray of light in the depths of the long night, the Immernachtreich will welcome you with the grandest of music ceremonies on the occasion of our next reunion. As surely as the stars in the sky watch over us, we shall meet again.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 oz 04.ogg}} '''Oz:''' What Mein Fräulein means is that you're always welcome to visit her at home as well.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 18.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Cool! Ah, I have so many new friends now... I'm so happy!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 wanderer 21.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Are you done yet? If you want to leave, then get over here.
:{{DIcon}} Take care.
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 19.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Thank you, everyone! Thank you so much! The blessings you gave me are more precious than any treasure, and more beautiful than any fairytale!
:{{A|vo yqeq304 5 littledurin 20.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Next time, it will be my turn to make your wishes come true!

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Wanderer or Nahida)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The people from the Akademiya say they haven't seen you in a while.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Yeah, well maybe I needed some space after being cooped up in there for so long. Anyway, it's a school, not a prison, so what's the problem?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I never said it was a problem. I was just noticing that you seem to be in quite a good mood at the moment.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...

;(Talk to Nilou)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 froga 01.ogg}} '''Stream:''' Wow! What a gorgeous lotus stage! Fit for the Forest Fairy herself, after all.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 almond 01.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Mhm... A wonderful sight indeed. But, uh... Madame Fairy, I believe the dog over there has been staring at us for quite a while...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ah, that's Swoof! Don't worry, he's a good dog. He doesn't bite.
:'''Swoof:''' Woof, woof!
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Haha, that's a good boy! I haven't seen you in ages, Swoof. No eating the frogs and hamsters here, okay?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 mousec 01.ogg}} '''Padisarah:''' No eating!
:'''Swoof:''' Woof!
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 almond 02.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Ah... Haha, what a, what a well-behaved doggie. You see, Stream? I told you, didn't I? The outside world isn't nearly as dangerous as we feared.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 froga 02.ogg}} '''Stream:''' Mhm, you were right. But with that said, Grandpa Almond... why are you hiding behind me?

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Nilou, optional)

===Kirara===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kirara)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hey there! It's good to see you again.
:{{DIcon}} About your clothes...
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02a 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hehe, pretty amazing, right? I never thought I'd be able to keep this outfit in the real world! I really like the texture, too &mdash; it feels so nice against my skin. Still, not the best thing to wear when I'm out on a delivery...
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02a 2.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Something about running around carrying a parcel when I'm dressed like this seems to make everyone suspicious... Especially the Gardes, the Millelith, and so on. They always stop me and interrogate me on the spot.
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02a 3.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' *sigh*... Guess I'll just have to switch back to my old outfit when I'm on the job.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the recent adventure...
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02b 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Oh, it was fantastic! A magical world, full of things I'd never seen before. Great scenery, really friendly people... Oh, and I also took a trip back to the Forest of Blessings after we parted ways.
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02b 2.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Grandpa Almond introduced me to everyone in the Forest, and reassured them that I wouldn't scratch anything. I made sure to fully retract my claws while I was there &mdash; I didn't wanna find out how they'd react to seeing them!
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02b 3.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hehe, with this adventure under my belt, I can turn the tables on my grandma &mdash; it's my turn to tell her some stories!
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About your future plans...
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02c 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' After peace returned to Simulanka, a lot of people started saying they wanted to pay a visit to the world beyond. But they're a little worried about whether it's safe or not.
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02c 2.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' If any of them do visit Teyvat, I'd love to be their guide. I could even use my delivery box to take them around! If anyone understands the joy of seeing new things, it's me!
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Let's catch up another time.
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 kirara 02d 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Sure thing! It's always a pleasure adventuring with you guys. I had so much fun!

;(Talk to Navia, Chiori, or Clorinde)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...And that's the way the cookie crumbled! So, what do you think? You two fancy taking a stroll around my kingdom?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Sounds like someone's been playing a little too much Tabletop Troupe?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Not at all. I actually haven't seen her at all in a little while.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ugh, I'm telling you, it's all real! Just come with me, and you'll see it for yourself!
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' So you were the "King," huh? Hmm... Somehow, that part doesn't sound so far-fetched. I actually think you'd fill those boots quite easily.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thanks for the vote of confidence!
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, if we're going to be traveling with a King, we'll need proper titles as well, right? I guess... I can be the royal tailor.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Okay... Then I'll be Her Majesty's personal bodyguard?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hahaha, I'm sure those would work, but we don't have rules like that in my kingdom! Oh yeah, and can we go buy a music box first?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Why, exactly?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Let's just say I've developed a new appreciation for them after my recent adventures.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Just imagine it... One night, while I'm asleep, one of the small dancing figures in the music box suddenly steps off its track, and starts moving on its own... Wouldn't that be amazing?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Though this may be a normal occurrence in your fairytale world, Your Majesty, I must implore you to inform me immediately should any such incidents transpire in the real world.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Because, from the perspective of a Marechaussee Hunter... or really, any normal person...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq304 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That music box sounds like bad news.
