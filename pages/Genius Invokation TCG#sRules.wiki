Rules and gameplay overview of [[Genius Invokation TCG]].

==Main Objective==
Genius Invokation TCG is a game where the player faces opponents with a deck of cards.

A deck is made up of [[Character Card]]s and [[Action Card]]s. Use Character Cards to attack and defeat the opponent's Character Cards. Once they have all been defeated, victory is achieved.

==Game Areas==
[[File:Genius Invokation TCG Game Areas.png|400px|thumb]]
;Character Zone
After the game begins, all Character Cards will be placed in the Character Zone. Each player will have to select an active character to be on the field. Only active characters can use Skills. Active characters are in a more forward position.
;Elemental Dice
Displays Elemental Dice that are available to be expended.
;Character Skills

;Summons Zone
Some Character Skills, Event Cards and Elemental Reactions can create Summons in the Summons Zone to assist the player. The Summons Zone can hold up to 4 Summons.
;Support Zone
Support Cards will placed in the Support Zone after they are played. The Support Zone can hold up to 4 Support Cards.
;Draw Pile
Before the game starts, all Action Cards in a deck will be shuffled and will form the Draw Pile. When drawing cards, the player will draw Action Cards from the Draw Pile and add them to their Hand. (If the Draw Pile has no card left, then no new card will be added to Hand.)
;Hand
In a duel, the player can draw cards from the Draw Pile and add them to their Hand. (The player can have a maximum of 10 cards in their Hand; attempting to draw more cards will cause the cards drawn to be discarded.) Playing cards can have different effects, so a correct combination of cards can achieve the best possible effect.

Genius Invokation TCG is a turn-based card game. Each duel consists of three phases: Preparation > Rounds > Victory Evaluation. Each Round will proceed as follows: Roll Phase > Action Phase > End Phase.

===Preparation===
Before a duel starts, both sides will draw 5 cards from their Draw Pile, which will form their Hand. After that, both sides will get 1 chance to switch out any number of cards in their Hand.

Once the player has decided on the starting Hand, a Character Card must be selected as the player's active character.

===Rounds===
A match can consist of up to 15 rounds before the game automatically concedes both players.

====Roll Phase====
Players will roll 8 Elemental Dice at the start of each Round to use for that round. After throwing these dice, the player will have 1 chance to choose any number of Elemental Dice and reroll them.

Once the Roll Phase is over, the player will enter the Action Phase.

====Action Phase====
During the Action Phase, a player will go first, and both sides will take turns to make their moves. In matchmaking and Co-Op Mode, the player who goes first is randomized. In the other modes, you will always go first.

Possible actions include:
* '''Use Skill:''' Pay the relevant cost and use the active character's Skill(s).
* '''Switch Characters:''' Pay 1 Elemental Die of the player's choice to switch the active character.
* '''Play Card:''' Pay the relevant cost and play card(s) from the player's Hand.
* '''Elemental Tuning:''' Discard a card from the player's Hand and change the Elemental Type of 1 of the player's Elemental Die.
* '''Declare Round End:''' End the player's actions for this Round. The first player to declare the end of their Round will go first during the next Round. Once both players have declared the end of their Round, the Action Phase will end and this Round's End Phase will begin. Remaining Elemental Dice from the current Round are not carried over to the next Round.

Actions can be categorized into two types: Combat Actions and Fast Actions
* '''Combat Action:''' After the player completes 1 Combat Action, the turn will be passed to the opponent. Using Skills, switching characters, playing most Talent Cards and declaring Round end are considered Combat Actions.
* '''Fast Action:''' The player can continue their turn after completing a Fast Action. Playing most cards and Elemental Tuning are considered Fast Actions.

====End Phase====
In the End Phase, starting with the player who acted first, various card effects will be triggered in order on the field. Both players will then draw 2 cards from their Draw Piles and the next Round begins.

The Rounds will continue until a player is victorious.

==Card Types==
===Character Cards===
The character's HP will appear to the top-left of the Character Card. HP will decrease when the character takes DMG, and they will go down if their HP reaches O.

Each Character Card will have the following skills:
* '''Normal Attack:''' Costs '''0—1''' matching Elemental Die and '''2''' unaligned Elemental Dice to use. Every Character Card has '''1''' Normal Attack.
* '''Elemental Skill:''' Costs '''3''' or '''5''' matching Elemental Dice. Character Cards can have '''0—2''' Elemental Skills, with 1 being the most common.
* '''Elemental Burst:''' Costs '''3–4''' matching Elemental Dice and '''2–3''' Energy. Every Character Card has '''1''' Elemental Burst.
* '''Passive Skill:''' Only available on specific Character Cards and provides passive effects.

Each time the character unleashes a Normal Attack or Elemental Skill, the Character will gain 1 Energy. The character's Energy is displayed on the right side of the Character Card. When the character's Energy maxes out, Elemental Bursts become available to use.

Every Character Card can have Equipment Cards, Character Statuses, and Team Combat Statuses attached to it.
* '''Equipment Cards:''' Each character can attach at most 1 Weapon and 1 Artifact Equipment Card, and any number of other types of Equipment.
* '''Character Statuses:''' Some Character Skills and Event Cards can create Character Statuses that can be attached to Character Cards and only affect the Character Card these were attached to. Symbols indicating Character Statuses will be placed will be placed ''within'' the Character Card at the lower-left corner.
* '''Team Combat Statuses:''' Some Character Skills and Event Cards can create Team Combat Statuses that can be attached to Character Cards. When the active character is switched out, the Team Combat Statuses will be passed to the new active character. Symbols indicating Team Combat Statuses will be placed ''outside'' the Character Cards at the lower-left corner.

===Action Cards===
There are 3 types of Action Cards, each with different effects:
* '''Equipment Cards:''' These are equipped on characters to apply an effect that buffs this character.
* '''Event Cards:''' Play these to immediately trigger all their effects.
* '''Support Cards:''' Place these in the Support Zone to continuously apply supporting effects.

During a match, 30 Action Cards in the Deck will form the Draw Pile. When the game starts, each player will draw cards from their Draw Pile to form their Hand each round.

When the player plays Action Cards with a Cost, the corresponding Elemental Dice need to be expended. Action Cards generally cost [[File:Genius Invokation TCG Matching Cost.png|20px]] Matching Dice of any element or [[File:Genius Invokation TCG Unaligned Cost.png|20px]] Unaligned Dice, except Talent Action Cards which will require Matching Dice of a specific element and sometimes Energy.

==Deck Composition==
Travelers can open the deck menu using the [[Casket of Tomes]] to edit a deck.

A deck needs to have 3 valid Character Cards and 30 valid Action Cards to be set as an active deck.

==Elemental Reactions==
===Elemental Application===
During a match, when a character takes {{Cryo}}, {{Hydro}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Electro}} or {{Dendro}} DMG, they will be affected by the corresponding element. ({{Anemo}} DMG and {{Geo}} DMG do not apply their corresponding element)

Additionally, certain environments/ conditions will also apply elements to characters.

When the target has already had an Elemental Application:
# Dealing a specific type of Elemental DMG will trigger an Elemental Reaction.
# Using non-DMG effects to perform specific Elemental Applications will also trigger an Elemental Reaction.<br /><nowiki>*</nowiki>When calculating the effects of such Elemental Reactions, all DMG-dealing effects will be ignored.

===Elemental Reaction Effects===
* {{Icon/Element|Dendro}} + {{Icon/Element|Hydro}} '''Bloom:''' DMG +1 for this instance, creates a Dendro Core that grants +2 DMG to the next instance of Pyro/Electro DMG
* {{Icon/Element|Dendro}} + {{Icon/Element|Pyro}} '''Burning:''' DMG +1 for this instance, creates a [[Burning Flame]] that will deal 1 Pyro DMG at the end of the Round (Takes effect once, max 2 stacks)
* {{Icon/Element|Cryo}}/{{Icon/Element|Electro}}/{{Icon/Element|Hydro}}/{{Icon/Element|Pyro}} + {{Icon/Element|Geo}} '''Crystallize:''' DMG +1 for this instance, your active character gains 1 Shield point (Can stack, max 2 points)
* {{Icon/Element|Electro}} + {{Icon/Element|Hydro}} '''Electro-Charged:''' DMG +1 for this instance, deal 1 Piercing DMG to all opposing characters except the target
* {{Icon/Element|Cryo}} + {{Icon/Element|Hydro}} '''Frozen:''' DMG +1 for this instance, the target is unable to perform any Actions this round (Can be removed in advance after the target receives Physical or Pyro DMG, in which case they will take +2 DMG)
* {{Icon/Element|Cryo}} + {{Icon/Element|Pyro}} '''Melt:''' DMG +2 for this instance
* {{Icon/Element|Electro}} + {{Icon/Element|Pyro}} '''Overloaded:''' DMG +2 for this instance, the target is forcibly switched to the next character
* {{Icon/Element|Dendro}} + {{Icon/Element|Electro}} '''Quicken:''' DMG +1 for this instance, creates a Catalyzing Field that grants +1 DMG to the next 2 instances of Dendro/Electro DMG
* {{Icon/Element|Cryo}} + {{Icon/Element|Electro}} '''Superconduct:''' DMG +1 for this instance, deal 1 Piercing DMG to all opposing characters except the target
* {{Icon/Element|Cryo}}/{{Icon/Element|Electro}}/{{Icon/Element|Hydro}}/{{Icon/Element|Pyro}} + {{Icon/Element|Anemo}} '''Swirl:''' Deals 1 DMG of the involved non-Anemo Element to all opposing characters except the target
* {{Icon/Element|Hydro}} + {{Icon/Element|Pyro}} '''Vaporize:''' DMG +2 for this instance

===Reaction Priority===
When a card has both {{Cryo}} and {{Dendro}} statuses at the same time, if {{Electro}}/{{Hydro}}/{{Pyro}} are applied, the Cryo reaction will be triggered, and the Dendro application will remain unaffected.

==Piercing DMG==
Certain attacks in Genius Invokation TCG are able to deal '''Piercing DMG'''. Piercing DMG has the following properties:
* Does not have an Elemental type.
* Cannot be increased by any bonuses.
* Cannot be defended against using Shields or DMG Immunity.
