|text    = Mighty Mt. Qingce gently cradles this peaceful village, silently protecting the old, the young, and the abundant croplands within its embrace. The legend of the [[Chi|ancient threat]] subdued beneath the mountain has been consigned to legend along with those who know of it, never again to return.
