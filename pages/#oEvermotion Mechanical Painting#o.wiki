|description    = A special artwork crafted by a "[[Félix Yogue|dreamer]]" from [[Fontaine]]. This "dreamer" sought to use this artwork to show off the abilities of his marvelous invention, the Kinesis Core.<br />The Evermotion Mechanical Painting is made from many interlocking parts. If you so much as initiate a small amount of movement, this painting can remain in automatic motion for a long period of time, allowing you to safely leave it unattended for a time.<br />If this were to be sold in the market, it would surely be quite the popular product.
