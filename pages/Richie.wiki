'''Richie'''<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tia}}</ref> is a [[Forest-Patrol Hound]] that can be found at [[Wangshu Inn]], just outside from [[Verr Goldet]]'s counter. He can be seen running around in circles, sitting, and lying down on the ground. 

==Profile==
According to [[Huai'an]], Richie was named in the hopes that he would bring good luck to the inn. This has worked out well so far, as Richie is apparently obedient and likes interacting with guests.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Huai'an}}</ref> [[Tia]] enjoys playing with both him and [[Wei (Cat)|Wei]] the cat.
