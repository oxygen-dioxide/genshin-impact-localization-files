{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to {{No Selflink|Verut}} or {{No Selflink|Aurele}})
:'''Verut:''' Big brother, this place is kinda narrow. We can't race like this...
:'''Aurele:''' It's fine. The adults say that boats can sail wherever there's water. Why don't we make small boats? You know, like the aquabuses!
:'''Verut:''' Ooh, nice! And then we can race using those boats, can't we?
:'''Aurele:''' Good idea. Now, as for the materials... Should we go ask Mr. Hugues?
:'''Verut:''' Must we? Every time we ask him to fix a toy, he'll deliver something completely different back to us.
:'''Aurele:''' But isn't that a good thing? If he can turn a boat into an aircraft, I'd even workn for him, really!
