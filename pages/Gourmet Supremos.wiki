Though they all share the same goal of improving their skills and cooking good food, each Gourmet Supremo has their own unique perspective on food.

Xudong, who was likely the one who named the group,<ref name="OTR">{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: On the Road}}</ref> originally ran a restaurant in Liyue<ref name="CO">{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: Cook-Off}}</ref> and knew [[Xiangling]]'s father [[Chef Mao]]. He travels the world due to his desire to have a "breakthrough," but struggles with inspiration.<ref name="BT">{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: Breakthrough Thinking}}</ref> However, this does not stop him from experimenting with dishes; whenever he gets a new recipe, he only follows it for a few days before he begins to "improve" them. These improvements are often ways to make the dish less expensive, to Parvaneh's bewilderment.<ref name="FQ">{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: Foodie Quiz}}</ref> He has a desire to make sure the people around him never go hungry, and believes that if everybody in the world could eat well, it would be a better place.<ref name="TIOEW">{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: The Importance of Eating Well}}</ref>

Parvaneh is focused on her mission of creating an "ultimate seasoning," a seasoning that can make any dish delicious. Although this is her thesis statement in [[Sumeru Akademiya]], both the other Gourmet Supremos and her fellow academics question whether such a thing is possible. Julie and Xudong try to stop her when she seasons their food.<ref name="OTR" /> Her reason for joining the Gourmet Supremos, despite her hatred of their name, is partially influenced by Xudong's unconventional cooking methods; similarly, Xudong was likely willing to take her in because of her skills.<ref name="FQ" /> She has the most particular tastes, finding [[Onigiri]] unimpressive, though she eats it anyways.<ref name="DD">{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: The Deep Divers}}</ref>

Julie has the perspective that "it's all good as long it tastes good," and doesn't seem to take issue with most types of food,<ref name="DD" /> besides Parvaneh's special seasoning.

Kamei Munehisa is a serious man with deeply-felt opinions about cooking. His best dish is the [[Tri-Flavored Skewer]], which he often made while he was a cook in the [[Shogunate]] and later teaches to [[Xudong]].<ref name="CO" /><ref name="FQ" /> He believes in creating dishes that are perfect quality, and explains that his heart is never satisfied with mere acceptability. Munehisa refers to this as the "extreme path," and relates it to swordsmanship. He hopes to enlighten Xudong to his pursuit of perfection, though the other man seems hesitant.<ref name="CO" />

After traveling in Inazuma, they plan to travel to Sumeru next.<ref name="TIOEW" />
