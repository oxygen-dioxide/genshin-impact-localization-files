|text1   = In the Convoy-themed challenge, you must protect a Driftstone Raft that will automatically move towards a destination.<br>The Raft will come under attack and will be obstructed while en route. If the Raft reaches its destination within the time limit without being destroyed, the challenge is a success.
|image2  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 8.png
|text2   = The Driftstone Raft comprises a propulsion device and 4 stone-raft components. Each of these components can be destroyed as a standalone part. Pick up Repair Parts and stay on top of the Driftstone Raft to repair it.<br>The propulsion device will constantly consume Drift Energy while en route. If it runs out of energy, it will stop moving. Pick up Drift Energy and stay on top of the Driftstone Raft to replenish the device's energy.
|image3  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 9.png
|text3   = The Driftstone Raft's progress will sometimes be barred by some Ominous Obstacles. One type of obstacle will cause the Raft to stop moving. Destroy these Ominous Obstacles to allow the Raft to proceed. The other type will deal damage to the Raft as it passes through.
