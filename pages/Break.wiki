{{Quest Description|It's curtains for this act, and Lynette gets a long-overdue break...}}
===Penalties...?===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{Black Screen|The whirlwind of events is finally resolved...<br>A few days later, you once again make your way to the opera house at Lynette's invitation...}}
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918401 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' *yawn*... Urgh...
:{{DIcon}} You're finally awake...
:{{DIcon}} The show's about to start.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918401 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Oh, is it...? Ah, I'm so much more at home here in the audience. I get to sit on a comfy seat, and I don't have to activate my energy-consuming modes all the time.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like [[Ginna]] got more than she bargained for out of that backstage job...
:{{DIcon}} You gave her your supporting role in the play, too?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918401 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' [[Merieux]] said she's a very promising young actress, and she has natural chemistry with her [[Gillian|older sister]]. In their capable hands, the show doesn't need me to attract an audience anymore.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918401 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Phew... freedom at last...
:{{DIcon}} You don't feel even a little bit disappointed?
:{{DIcon}} Fame was right around the corner.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918401 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Hmm... Fame is more trouble than it's worth. I'd rather leave that side of things to my brother and the others.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918401 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I'm happiest when I get to sit in a quiet place, watch them do their thing, and cheer them on.
:{{DIcon}} Like you're doing now?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918401 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Yep. Exactly like I'm doing now.
