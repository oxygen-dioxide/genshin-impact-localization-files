'''Momoyo''' {{Lang|ja=百代}} is an [[NPC]] in [[Inazuma]]. She is part of the [[Shuumatsuban]].

==Profile==
"Momoyo" is the current codename of a ninja of the Shuumatsuban who previously posed as a shrine maiden at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] under the name "[[Gendou Ringo]]", a name she picked for herself. She worked alongside [[Momoka]].

Momoka was presumably killed by the Fatui during one of her operations but left behind her own secret code as the Fatui were trying to infiltrate the Shuumatsuban. As each ninja had their own special code, those who tried to use Momoka's would be immediately revealed as an imposter. The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], traveling around Inazuma, came across the code strip by chance while exploring [[Araumi]]. They brought the code to Momoyo, who was surprised. Suspecting them of being Fatui spies, she sent them to defeat some Fatui agents to discern their intentions and tailed them. In the process, she was ambushed by other Fatui spies, although she was able to escape them by faking her death. [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]] took her place as "Gendou Ringo", who continued giving them missions in hopes of infiltrating the Shuumatsuban.

After the Traveler eliminated the "Demonbane Kin", Momoyo left a note on the slip which Paimon took out of curiosity. When they arrived, she knocked the Traveler out and took them to her hideout, where she demanded to know how they came across Momoka's code. The Traveler explained the situation to her, which she believed as they did not report to the Fatui after each mission. The following day, she had them rendezvous with her at the hideout, where she believed that her imposter was trying to infiltrate the Shuumatsuban and tasked the Traveler with finding information on what the Fatui were up to.

The Traveler learned that Momoyo's imposter, Lyudochka, was being given new orders regarding [[Watatsumi Island]]. She gave them some powder so they could track Lyudochka, where they eavesdropped on a conversation between her and her superior [[Efim Snezhevich]] on the nature of the operation. After defeating Lyudochka, who expressed genuine remorse and did not want to proceed with the operation, the Traveler took pity on her and asked Momoyo if she could create a fake corpse of the former. Momoyo was surprised but accepted the request, "killing" Lyudochka and allowed herself to get captured by the Fatui to convince them that Lyudochka was killed. In the ensuing scuffle, one of the Fatuus shot the box of powder, some of which got into her eyes.

The Traveler soon discovered Momoyo through the trail of powder she had left behind and freed her from the Fatui safehouse. She lost sight in her left eye following the incident but shook it off as a worthy trade for protecting Inazuma and that she could infiltrate a pirate group if needed. Momoyo returned to the shrine and contacted [[Sayu]], after which she departed from the shrine.

===Personality===
Momoyo has a curt and rather rude attitude even when posing as a shrine maiden, a contrast noted by Traveler and Paimon. She appeared to hold little interest in being a shrine maiden, often failing to use the proper terminology and openly questioning the veracity of the fortune slips.

The Traveler and Paimon later discover that Momoyo does care for other people, although she does so in a way that sounds like she doesn't do so. As a member of the Shuumatsuban, she takes pride in protecting her nation, even if it means sustaining injuries in the process.
