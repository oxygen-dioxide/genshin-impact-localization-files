'''Adeptus' Temptation''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The recipe for Adeptus' Temptation is obtainable by opening a [[Chest]] on the floating island above [[Qingyun Peak]]. Adeptus' Temptation can also be obtained as a reward from the [[Nine Pillars of Peace]] quest.

Depending on the quality, Adeptus' Temptation increases the party's Attack by '''260'''/'''316'''/'''372''' and Critical Rate by '''8'''/'''10'''/'''12'''% for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].
