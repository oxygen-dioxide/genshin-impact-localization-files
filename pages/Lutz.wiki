{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lutz:''' Are you here to send a letter? If so, do you mind if I help you polish it a little?
:{{DIcon}} A letter?
::'''Lutz:''' We can deliver letters to almost anyone in Fontaine, as long as you have the Coupons to pay for postage. Though we're practically doing it as charity, if I do say so myself.
::'''Lutz:''' So would you like to send a letter? If so, please pay for postage first. And also, no queue jumping.
::{{DIcon}} I can write to anyone?
:::'''Lutz:''' Well, usually we recommend writing to relatives or friends or... uh, joint guarantors, people like that?
:::'''Lutz:''' And though we're operating for the public benefit, we have limited manpower. What is it they say? Resources are not allocated at random...
:::{{DIcon}} Got it, thanks.
:::'''Lutz:''' Oh, don't mention it.
::{{DIcon}} Not right now.
:::'''Lutz:''' Okay. Well, I'm here, typewriter and pneumatic tube at the ready. You know where to find me.
:{{DIcon}} Not right now.
::'''Lutz:''' Okay. Come find me if you need to send any mail.
