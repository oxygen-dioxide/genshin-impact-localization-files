'''Onodera''' is an event-exclusive [[NPC]] that appeared in the [[Hues of the Violet Garden]] and [[Warrior's Spirit]] events.

==Profile==
Onodera is an editor at the [[Yae Publishing House]].  He is the organizer for the release party of the publishing houses' newest light novels which will be showcased at Inazuma's international cultural festival, the [[Irodori Festival]].

As the organizer, he wanted to ensure that the release of [[A Legend of Sword]] to be special. So, he planned to release signed copies of the novel.  However, the author [[Zhenyu]] has poor handwriting which was not reflected in the copy of his signature that he has previously set to the publishing house. To buy time for the author to legibly write his signature, Onodera and Zenyu took the printed novels from the warehouse and tirelessly worked on the novels at Onodera's house.
