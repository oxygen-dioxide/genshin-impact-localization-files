==Notes==
*Cryo slimes are immune to [[Frozen]], but they can be [[wet]]. This may occur from contact with Hydro slimes, Hydro-based attacks, and [[rain]]. When attacked with [[Anemo]] they will swirl [[Hydro]] (in preference) initially until that status is removed, after which they then swirl with Cryo. The wet status is only briefly indicated together with Anemo on a Swirl.
