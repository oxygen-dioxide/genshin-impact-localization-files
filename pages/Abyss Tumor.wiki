'''Abyss Tumors''' are constructs that are spawned by [[Gosoythoth]] during the [[Abyss]] invasion of [[Natlan]] during the {{Quest|The Surging Darkness}}. They in turn spawn multiple [[Abyssal Pylon]]s that continually summon Abyss enemies, often including [[Tenebrous Mimiflora]]. Tumors are normally impervious to all damage. However, destroying all of a Tumor's spawned Pylons will allow the Tumor to be destroyed when the player is supported by the [[Pyro Archon]].
