'''Aradasha''' is a historical figure of the [[Aranara]], who repaired the [[Varuna Contraption]] alongside [[Aramuhukunda]] and [[Traveler's Sibling|Nara Varuna]]. Aradasha was regarded as the strongest [[Ararakalari]] user, second only to the Aranara's creator [[Queen Aranyani]].<ref name="Arakarman">{{Ref/NPC|Arakarman|s=2|note=Aradasha's story}}</ref> It is mentioned as the Aranara who defeated and sealed eighteen [[Ruin Machines|big metal monsters]], and disappeared afterward.<ref name="Arakarman"/>

Aradasha's legacy is the focus of the World Quest ''[[Legends of the Stone Lock]]'', when the [[Traveler]] unsealed and destroyed sixteen sealed Ruin Machines, and then defeated a sealed [[Perpetual Mechanical Array]] with the help of [[Aradashan]], [[Arayuta]], [[Arasata]], and [[Arasaha]]. It is unclear what the eighteenth Ruin Machine that Aradasha sealed was. A possible candidate is the [[Ruin Golem]] in [[Devantaka Mountain]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For the Children of the Past}}</ref>
