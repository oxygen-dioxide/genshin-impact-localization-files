The '''Defense Mechanism''' is a [[Unique Enemy]] found in [[Dragonspine]].

It resembles a spherical automaton with a petal-like head, and a tail on its back. It is similar to the sign on the door of a [[Domain]]. When inactive, they fold their petals and lie on the ground.

==Locations==
The Defense Mechanism is currently found in several places throughout [[Dragonspine]], and spawns in [[Crimson Wish]] missions. One could also be encountered in ''[[From Outer Lands]]'', a [[World Quest]] in [[Version 1.6]]'s [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]].

==Trivia==
* As they are technically a hazardous obstacle rather than an enemy (despite the battle music), they are not listed in the [[Archive]]s.
** Summons and [[Ningguang]]'s attacks don't target it (although Normal Attacks will auto-target them), and [[Mini Seelie]], which normally hide when entering combat, will not hide from them.
** Moreover, hitting them does not generate [[Energy]].
** [[Tartaglia]]'s Riptide does not seem to apply to it.
* Defense Mechanisms spawn with stats based on the player's [[World Level]], but because they do not despawn, they retain the same stats.
** This means that loading an area where Defense Mechanisms spawn at a low level will make them very easy to kill at later levels, as their HP will not increase.
* Unique among them is that they also target enemies present in its sight, making them the only enemy to do so.
