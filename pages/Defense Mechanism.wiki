The '''Defense Mechanism''' is a [[Unique Enemy]] found in [[Dragonspine]].

It resembles a spherical automaton with a petal like head, and a tail on its back. It is similar to the sign on the door of a Domain. When inactive, they fold their petals and lie on the ground.

==Locations==
The Defense Mechanism is currently found in several places throughout [[Dragonspine]], and spawns in [[Crimson Wish]] missions. One can also be encountered in a [[World Quests|World Quest]], [[From Outer Lands]], on the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]].

==Trivia==
* As they're technically a hazardous obstacle rather than an enemy (despite the battle music), they are not listed in the [[archive]]s.
** Summons and [[Ningguang]]'s attacks don't target it (although Normal Attacks will auto-target them), and [[Seelie#Mini Seelie|Mini Seelie]], which normally hide from enemies, will not hide from them.
** Moreover, hitting them does not generate [[Energy]].
** [[Tartaglia]]'s Riptide does not seem to apply to it.
* Defense Mechanisms spawn with stats based on the player's [[World Level]], but because they do not respawn or despawn, they retain the same stats.
** This means that loading an area where Defense Mechanisms spawn at level 40 will make them very easy to kill at later levels, seeing as their health bar does not increase.
* Unique among them is that they also target enemies present in its sight, making them the only enemy to do so.
