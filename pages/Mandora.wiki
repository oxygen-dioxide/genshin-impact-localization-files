{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mandora:''' Oh! I haven't seen you anywhere in [[Veluriyam Mirage]] before. Have you traveled here from afar?
:'''Mandora:''' Ah, I know! You're the one everyone is talking about, the great hero who fixed the Mirage for Miss [[Idyia]]!
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
:'''Mandora:''' Sorry, I should have introduced myself. My name is Mandora, a resident here, and... a former adventurer.
:'''Mandora:''' I've been living here for quite some time. Ask me if you have any questions about the place.
:{{DIcon}} Former?
::'''Mandora:''' Yes, I used to be an adventurer, but not now.
::'''Mandora:''' After stumbling into this Mirage during a desert adventure, I decided to make it my home, and live a peaceful and stable life!
::'''Mandora:''' Since then, I haven't left. No more adventures...
::{{DIcon}} But...
::'''Mandora:''' Oh, I misspoke earlier. I should have said, "I stopped adventuring in Mandora's stead."
::'''Mandora:''' She left me here, and returned to her world of thrilling travels and brilliant adventures. Tsk, she really is a clever girl! But you know, that's just typical of adventurers.
::'''Mandora:''' Just like how anyone swearing "This is the last time, I promise!" always breaks their promises!
::'''Mandora:''' *sigh* Of course, after becoming "Mandora," I can understand how she felt... So it's not like I'll get riled up over it. It's just that...
::'''Mandora:''' After she left the Mirage... does she ever still think of me? If the thought of me could strengthen her resolve and help her walk her chosen path, that would really be something, haha.
:{{DIcon}} I've got things to do...
::'''Mandora:''' That's okay. Great heroes have to stay on the move... Or perhaps, it is only by staying on the move that one can gradually become a hero?
