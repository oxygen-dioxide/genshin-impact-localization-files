==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Furuta:''' A guest. Welcome, hehe...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...
::'''Furuta:''' Don't mistake me for just another old lady. I once served and attended to the [[Yae Miko|Lady Guuji]] herself...
::'''Furuta:''' My old friend [[Nakanishi]] and I had been serving for the [[Kamisato Clan]] since the former Commissioner was in office.
::'''Furuta:''' As we got older, our bodies became less nimble than before, so we retired.
::'''Furuta:''' As for me... thanks to [[Kamisato Ayaka|Miss Kamisato]]'s graciousness, I can still be a housekeeper in this mansion. I can do some chores and take care of youngsters like [[Koharu]]. Hehe.
::'''Furuta:''' I really wish Koharu would learn housekeeping from [[Thoma]] more. Then, I could really relax...
::{{DIcon}} Housekeeping?
:::'''Furuta:''' Indeed, and the most capable housekeeper in this mansion would be Thoma.
:::'''Furuta:''' Whether it is trimming the courtyard, collecting furnishings, cooking, or sewing, Thoma can do them all nicely and quickly.
:::'''Furuta:''' It's almost a shame that he also needs to serve [[Kamisato Ayato|the Commissioner]] and Miss Kamisato, so he can't take care of everything.
:::'''Furuta:''' As long as he is around, the Kamisato Clan has no need of servants. Hahaha...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You must've been very skilled before.
:::'''Furuta:''' Hahaha, you praise me excessively. Right now, I'm nothing more than a servant of the Kamisato Clan. At best, I had some experience when I was still young...
:::'''Furuta:''' ...How about I give this to you. As you have no place to call home, some experience from this elderly servant may be of use to you.
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×4.)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye, granny.
::'''Furuta:''' Bye, take care now...
