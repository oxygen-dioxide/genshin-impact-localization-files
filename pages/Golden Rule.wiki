==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Yanfei's outfit consists of a dark red and black backless cropped top tied together with some red rope, a diamond-shaped chest window, gold accents, a white scarf-like wrapped collar accented with dark red, and a pair of detached, long, puffed white sleeves with black cuffs, a large white pom-pom attached to each. She wears a large, dark red xiezhi hat accented with black and gold. Her collar and hat are both adorned with gold tongbao-shaped buttons. As well as this, she wears a short dark red skirt lined with gold swirls akin to clouds, fastened with a yellow ribbon tied in a bow on her left hip over a pair of uneven black shorts with lace trim. Her footwear consists of a pair of red and gold upturned-toed boots with white fluffy lining and gold heels and soles.

Yanfei carries a thick book, fastened by two leather belts on her right hip, where her {{Pyro}} [[Vision]] is affixed. She also carries a large steelyard decorated with adeptus elements.
