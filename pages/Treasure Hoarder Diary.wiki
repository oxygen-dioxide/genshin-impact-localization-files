==Text==
"Haha! This must be my lucky day, stumbling right into treasure just like that. Who would have thought that these {{Color|buzzword|squat little trees with the red leaves}} would have so much treasure buried beneath them?"

"But something's really weird about all this. Not a soul lives here, and I've never heard of anyone living here either. So, who buried this? And why are the trees with treasure buried under them so short, when all the other trees have grown normally?"

"Well, whatever. Guess who's striking it rich this time? That's right, me, and no monster is going to stop me. I'll bring a cart, and slowly dig the goods out from under those {{Color|buzzword|short, red-leaved trees}}..."

==Trivia==
* This diary is assumed to be written by [[Liuliu]], who wrote the [[Ruins Investigation Logs]] at [[Dunyu Ruins]] and at [[Lingju Pass]].
