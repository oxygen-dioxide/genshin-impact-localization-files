{{Quest Description|In order to find Puca's token, you once again visit the vein from before...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Puca)
:'''Paimon:''' Puca, why are you here again?
:'''Paimon:''' There shouldn't be any more monsters nearby, but who knows what other dangers there might be...
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, you shouldn't go running off on your own!
:'''Puca:''' I didn't run off, Paimon and {{Traveler}}... I'm just looking for my token...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? You lost your token?
:'''Puca:''' Yup... It should be somewhere around that place I usually pick rocks from...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... You might've dropped it when you got trapped there before.
:'''Puca:''' *sniff* Yeah, you might be right... I was too scared to care about anything else at that time...
:'''Puca:''' It's still a little scary to think about, but my token's very important... I have to find it, I just have to...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon thinks it'll be too dangerous if Puca goes there on her own. In that case...
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, why don't we take a trip back there and help Puca find her token? Puca, just go home and wait for us!
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to us.
:{{DIcon}} I've been wanting to explore that place anyway.
:'''Puca:''' Thank you, {{Traveler}} and Paimon! I'll be good and wait for you at home.

;(Talk to Puca at her home)
:'''Puca:''' My token is really important... I have to find it...
----
;(Investigate the marked spot)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Puca's Token}} and {{Item|Strange Ore}})
:'''Paimon:''' This should be Puca's token!
:'''Paimon:''' It's stuck to a really strange hunk of ore! Paimon's never seen a rock like this before...
:'''Paimon:''' It looks so pretty! Maybe it's a kind of valuable gem!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's bring it back with us, then! Puca said she often picks up rocks here, she'll definitely know what this is.
----
;(Talk to Puca)
:'''Paimon:''' Puca, we're back! We found your token.
:{{Black Screen|You give the token to Puca.}}
:'''Puca:''' Ohh, yes, this is the one! Thank you so much!
:'''Paimon:''' We also found something else while we were looking for your token...
:[[File:Item Strange Ore.png|100px]]
:'''Paimon:''' It's an ore we've never seen before. We thought it might be valuable, so we brought it back!
:'''Paimon:''' If Paimon remembers correctly, you often pick up pretty stones around this area, right? Have you seen any stones like this before?
:'''Puca:''' Let me see... It really is pretty! But it's not precious at all... it's just an ordinary stone...
:'''Puca:''' It's true that you won't find anything like this in other places, but they're everywhere in nearby ore veins!
:'''Paimon:''' Aw, so it's just an ordinary rock! Paimon thought it looked super valuable...
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like we can't use it for anything else. Let's just find a place to dump it...
:{{DIcon}} But if you can't find the ore elsewhere...
:{{DIcon}} But if it's unique to this region...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean we could make a fortune if we took it elsewhere and sold it?
:'''Paimon:''' You do have a point! People don't normally go mining in a Melusine village, which means they've probably never seen anything like this... Great thinking, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, let's take this stone to the [[Court of Fontaine]] and show the merchants!
:'''Puca:''' If there's anything else you'd like to know about ores, come find me anytime...
:'''Puca:''' Though I don't run a gemstone workshop like my sister and don't know much about appraisals or processing...
:'''Puca:''' Compared to precious gems, I prefer collecting all kinds of unique rocks...
:'''Puca:''' I guess you can say I know the local ore veins pretty well!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, gotcha!

;(Talk to Puca again, optional)
:'''Puca:''' Hey there, it's you again!
:'''Puca:''' Is there anything you'd like to know about ore? You can ask me anything!
:'''Puca:''' Even though I might not have an answer...
:{{DIcon}} About precious gems...
::'''Puca:''' There's lots of beautiful and sparkly stones in the ore veins nearby, but they're nowhere as good as real gemstones...
::'''Puca:''' If I were better at finding real gemstones, maybe I could open my own gemstone workshop, just like [[Sluasi]]!
:{{DIcon}} About the uses of ore...
::'''Puca:''' Huh? I've never thought about that before... I only collect stones because they're pretty...
:{{DIcon}} I don't have any more questions.
::'''Puca:''' Hehe, thanks for coming to play with me!
----
;(Talk to Chesil)
:'''Chesil:''' Welcome, welcome. Our store offers the most extensive selection of precious gems in the entire Court of Fontaine. We also have a wide range of craft goods on sale.
:'''Chesil:''' Anything catch your eye? If not, I would be delighted to meet any other demands!
:{{DIcon}} We've got some mysterious ore here...
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! Since you have such an extensive inventory, you should know its value, right?
:'''Chesil:''' Oh? So you're here to trade ore?
:'''Chesil:''' Then you've come to the right person! We offer some of the best and fairest prices in Fontaine.
:'''Chesil:''' Let's see what you have here...
:{{Black Screen|You show Chesil the strange ore you found earlier.}}
:'''Chesil:''' Whoa... Even I've never seen anything like this before...
:'''Chesil:''' The unique sheen and smooth texture... Ooh, this is no doubt a rare variety!
:'''Chesil:''' Pardon me for asking, but what exactly is this?
:{{DIcon}} No idea.
::'''Chesil:''' Is that why you're here for an appraisal?
:{{DIcon}} Uh, it's a "Paimonial Rock"!
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, don't give it weird names!
:{{DIcon}} It's Dazzling Crystalline Gold.
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Did you just come up with that on the spot?
::'''Chesil:''' What an impressive name! No wonder it looks so unique.
:'''Chesil:''' It's such a shame you only brought one chunk of ore...
:'''Chesil:''' If only we had a steady supply... We could forge accessories that would take Fontaine by storm.
:'''Paimon:''' (Puca mentioned these stones were everywhere near the ore veins. Maybe we should ask her...)
:{{DIcon}} We actually have a lot more of this ore.
::'''Chesil:''' Really? That's wonderful!
:{{DIcon}} The source is a trade secret.
::'''Chesil:''' Oh, naturally, of course...
::'''Chesil:''' Though as long as you have a reliable way of getting them, it's fine.
:{{DIcon}} You can find them around [[Elynas]].
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Why did you just tell him?
::'''Chesil:''' You got it from Elynas, huh? Yeah, people wouldn't normally go prospecting there...
:'''Chesil:''' Anyway, in addition to the ore you brought, I'm willing to purchase more ore from you to make a batch of new products.
:'''Chesil:''' I'm willing to put down an advance payment to show my sincerity &mdash; as long as you bring more ore the next time you visit.
:'''Chesil:''' What do you think? I'd say it's a pretty fair deal.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon thinks so too! It's a deal!
:'''Chesil:''' Perfect! Here's your payment...
:'''Chesil:''' I wonder how the accessories made from this ore will turn out... Haha, can't say I'm not looking forward to it!
:'''Chesil:''' I'll be here, waiting for your good news.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, so there really are buyers! Looking at that merchant, is it possible that they're actually really useful gems, and it's just that Puca didn't know?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's hurry up and go back! We need to ask Puca where we can find more rocks like these!
:'''Paimon:''' And maybe we can even use this opportunity to make a fortune!
