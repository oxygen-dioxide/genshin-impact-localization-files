==Gameplay Notes==
* If the player starts {{Quest|Pressing Deadlines}} before accepting this quest, this quest cannot be unlocked until Pressing Deadlines is completed. However, the player can start this quest first and then accept Pressing Deadlines while this quest is still underway.
* If Pressing Deadlines is complete but this quest still cannot be started, {{Quest|Bookworm Swordsman}} must be completed first.
* In Step 8, the player does not have to talk to them in that exact order. Only speaking to Clerk Zhao progresses the quest; the other two are optional.
* This quest could not be started during the [[Lantern Rite]] event, because Nervous An had his time off during this event.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Nervous An, busy at the harbor, is looking for someone to help to ease the nerves of guests from other nations...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Nervous An)
:'''Nervous An:''' It never rains, but it pours...
:{{DIcon}} What's the matter?
:'''Nervous An:''' After that huge incident at the Rite of Descension, the streets have been filling up with [[Millelith]].
:'''Nervous An:''' The tension in the air hangs over us like a shroud. Our doors aren't closed, but...
:'''Nervous An:''' You know as well as I do how Liyue often does business with other nations, and how many people from every nation live in our city.
:'''Nervous An:''' They've brought us prosperity, and a fair amounts of cultural exchange, too.
:'''Nervous An:''' But this incident has caused many such people to be very ill at ease.
:'''Nervous An:''' I've been making preparations to try and calm people down, but with the situation as it is, I don't know where to begin looking for people good at international relations.
:'''Nervous An:''' Hmm, wait a moment. Traveler, you've been to many different parts of the world already, haven't you? You must be good at speaking to people from other nations.
:'''Nervous An:''' Could I trouble you, then, to help me calm some of our guests down?
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
::'''Nervous An:''' Thank you, you're a big help. Now, I need to go and settle some other matters.
:{{DIcon}} I'll give this a try...
::'''Nervous An:''' Well, then... please do. I really have no one else to turn to.

;(Talk to Nervous An again)
:'''Nervous An:''' *sigh* When will things go back to normal...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Freki and Geri===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Freki or Geri)
:'''Geri:''' Sister, we should just head back to Mondstadt...
:'''Freki:''' Oh, come on now, just don't eat any Zhongyuan Chop Suey next time.
:'''Geri:''' No, I wasn't talking about that... I mean, maybe I was, a bit...
:'''Geri:''' But the main thing is what happened at the Rite of Descension. Just think about it, sis, that was like one of those big ceremonies the Church holds in Lord Barbatos' honor.
:'''Geri:''' But if something like that could happen during such a ceremony, nowhere in Liyue is safe! We should head back to Mondstadt post-haste!
:{{DIcon}} Liyue's pretty safe.
::'''Freki:''' You see, Geri? I'm not the only one saying it. There's also this&mdash;
::'''Freki:''' Eh? You're... the Honorary Knight! I've heard of you, you took out Stormterror!
::'''Freki:''' See, Geri? Take it from the Honorary Knight. Liyue's a safe place, so let's continue to enjoy our pursuit of gourmet food in peace!
:{{DIcon}} Its not as if Mondstadt's that safe, either...
::'''Freki:''' Exactly, Geri! Mondstadt was attacked by a dragon, too. And yet, wasn't it taken care of by the Knights of Favonius in the end?
::'''Freki:''' So let's... Eh? You're that Honorary Knight, aren't you? The one who teamed up with the Knights to defeat Stormterror?
::'''Freki:''' You see, Geri, even the Honorary Knight has come to Liyue. We're fine, there's nothing to be afraid of.
::'''Freki:''' What's more, our gourmet journey has only just begun. We can't just stop here.
:'''Geri:''' Even if you say so, what if Liyue is full of these... frightening dishes, like Zhongyuan Chop Suey?
:'''Freki:''' Come on, Liyue is full of famous cuisine. You just haven't found on your preferences yet.
:'''Freki:''' I'm that sure that thing they call Jade Parcels will be more to your taste. Let's go try that next.
:'''Geri:''' But with Liyue in such a state, where will we go to find someone who will make this dish for us?
:{{DIcon}} I can do it. ''(Requires clearing [[Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip]])''{{Verify}}
::'''Freki:''' Really? Wow, I never knew that the Honorary Knight was a person of so many talents. We'll be counting on you, then.
::'''Freki:''' Come on, Geri, cheer up. Our gourmet journey isn't going to end here.
:{{DIcon}} I can help to look for someone...
::'''Freki:''' You will? That's great! I mean, you managed to solve a dragon attack. I don't think a single dish will pose any trouble for you.
::'''Freki:''' Get yourself together, Geri. Even the Honorary Knight's come to help us. There's no way our gourmet journey can end here!

;(Talk to Geri again)
:'''Geri:''' I still think we should go back to Mondstadt. *sigh* I could even do with a Satisfying Salad right now...

;(Talk to Freki without Jade Parcels)
:'''Freki:''' It seems that Zhongyuan Chop Suey just isn't Geri's thing.
:'''Freki:''' I mean, he finds it even more terrifying than the accident that occurred during the Rite of Descension. *chuckles*
:'''Freki:''' Hopefully, those Jade Parcels can restore his faith in Liyue's gourmet cuisine.

;(Talk to Freki with Jade Parcels)
:'''Freki:''' So, did you manage to get those Jade Parcels?
:{{DIcon}} Here they are.
:'''Freki:''' Wow, this... Come on, Geri. This one's definitely to your tastes.
:'''Geri:''' Really? Well, I'll give it a try... Ooh. This aroma, it really is good...
:'''Freki:''' Hahaha, it seems that Geri's been completely entranced by this dish.
:'''Freki:''' Well, guess that's the end of him wanting to go back to Mondstadt. Thank you, Honorary Knight. Looks like our journey will continue after all.

;(Talk to Freki or Geri again)
:'''Geri:''' ...This dish is really great. Liyue is so strange &mdash; on the one hand, you have terrifying dishes like that Zhongyuan Chop Suey, and on the other, there's wonderful flavors like this one...
:'''Freki:''' How is that strange? Didn't I say that Liyue has a lot of famous dishes? We haven't even come close to tasting them all!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ivanovich===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Ivanovich)
:'''Ivanovich:''' Hmm, maybe I should think of some other way...
:{{DIcon}} How are you doing?
:'''Ivanovich:''' Me? Hmm... You must be talking about the recent events here in Liyue Harbor. Well, I've no opinion on the matter, really.
:'''Ivanovich:''' That said, the people who have been supplying me with Snezhnayan goods and occasionally buy Cor Lapis from me are very unnerved.
:'''Ivanovich:''' I've told them that there should be no problem here in Liyue, but they said that they'd only be back in a few months, and that they'll wait and see how things shake out for now.
:'''Ivanovich:''' Fortunately, I'd already brought in several new batches of goods, so I can last for quite a while. I'm also taking the opportunity to stock up on some Cor Lapis.
:'''Ivanovich:''' I still need to man the store here, so could you help me ask Mr. Bolai if he has Cor Lapis that I could take off his hands?
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
::'''Ivanovich:''' Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} You're quite calm, aren't you?
::'''Ivanovich:''' The way I see it, this is nothing too serious. The daily routine in Liyue has yet to change either, so there's no reason to panic.
::'''Ivanovich:''' If you want to put it another way, if I stay calm while everyone else panics, aren't I ahead of the curve, then?

;(Talk to Ivanovich again)
:'''Ivanovich:''' Who knows how long these goods will last. Why, those cowardly fellows. How could they have let such a business opportunity slip through our fingers...
----
;(Talk to Bolai)
:'''Bolai:''' You... Are you sure this is really the time to talk business with me?
:{{DIcon}} It's about Ivanovich...
:'''Bolai:''' Oh, you mean that outlander who does business near the mouth of the harbor. He still wants my Cor Lapis?
:'''Bolai:''' Sure. I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
:'''Bolai:''' I just so happen to have a batch of Cor Lapis with me. I'd originally prepared it for another customer, but they declined for now, saying that Liyue hasn't been safe of late.
:'''Bolai:''' If that fellow wants to buy, then I'm happy to sell. Go tell him that &mdash; I'll stay here and prepare the goods first.
----
;(Talk to Ivanovich)
:'''Ivanovich:''' So, what was Mr. Bolai's response?
:{{DIcon}} He said that he'll make the goods ready.
:'''Ivanovich:''' Ah, that's great, then. He's a businessman I can trust.
:'''Ivanovich:''' When my less stout-hearted merchant comrades return to Liyue Harbor, it'll be time to make a killing.

;(Talk to Ivanovich again)
:'''Ivanovich:''' One who shrinks away from risk so easily cannot do business.
{{Dialogue End}}
===Atsuko===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Atsuko)
:'''Atsuko:''' Ah, what am I to do...
:'''Atsuko:''' Good fortune! Oh, I mean, hello... Is that right?
:'''Atsuko:''' I'm still not very familiar with the local greetings. Liyue really is completely different from Inazuma...
:{{DIcon}} You're from Inazuma?
::'''Atsuko:''' Yes. I experienced quite a number of trials in the process of coming here.
:{{DIcon}} So, why did you come to Liyue?
:'''Atsuko:''' Well, I'd always wanted to see the world, but the atmosphere in my homeland is... How should I say it? Tense? Dangerous?
:'''Atsuko:''' Even trying to leave Inazuma's borders is fraught with difficulty, never mind attempting to travel the world. A normal person would never even make it past the many assessments that the [[Kanjou Commission]] conduct.
:'''Atsuko:''' So I made my own raft, and sneaked over here to Liyue.
:'''Atsuko:''' I originally intended to find work here at the wharf as a sailor, but... I have no idea where to even begin looking for that job.
:'''Atsuko:''' Also, something must have happened in Liyue, because everything's gotten very tense all of a sudden.
:'''Atsuko:''' I don't think there's any place that would be willing to give a job to an outlander like me, is there...
:{{DIcon}} What are you good at?
::'''Atsuko:''' In my hometown, I would always help out at my family's store.
::'''Atsuko:''' I'd definitely say that I'm good at delivering goods. But what I've always wanted to be is a sailor...
:{{DIcon}} What would you like to do?
::'''Atsuko:''' Well, I'd like to be a sailor, of course! But I don't think I could start out as one...
::'''Atsuko:''' I'd be quite satisfied as long as I can get work.
::'''Atsuko:''' Don't underestimate me, now. Back in my hometown, I would always help out at my family's store. I'm very good at delivering goods.
:'''Atsuko:''' Eh? You want to help me find work? Thank you, that would be lovely! Ah, there are such fine people in Liyue...
:'''Atsuko:''' Ah, yes. I did make some preparations for finding work earlier by asking around.
:'''Atsuko:''' Those people said that if I wanted to find, ah, reliable work, I could go and find... Let me see, I'm sure I wrote it down here...
:'''Atsuko:''' Ah, there it is. Um... So, I can look for Manager Kuan, Clerk Zhao and Nervous An.
:'''Atsuko:''' But though I wrote it down, I'm not very familiar with the way in which local<!--sic--> interact, so I haven't dared to ask them.
:'''Atsuko:''' If you're willing to help me out, please help me ask them. Hopefully, one of them might be willing to hire me.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
::'''Atsuko:''' Thank you so much!
:{{DIcon}} There might not be openings for sailors...
::'''Atsuko:''' It's alright. I wasn't hoping to become a sailor upon arrival in Liyue, anyway. Let's take it slow.
::'''Atsuko:''' Again, thank you so much.

;(Talk to Atsuko again)
:'''Atsuko:''' I hope someone's willing to give me a job...
----
;(Talk to Manager Kuan)
:'''Manager Kuan:''' *sigh* Why haven't we received notice yet...
:{{DIcon}} About finding work...
:'''Manager Kuan:''' Finding work? You're barking up the wrong tree. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has sealed the Chasm. Work at the Blackcliff Forge has also been stopped.
:'''Manager Kuan:''' We've already got a lot of people sitting on their hands at the forge who can only do some odd jobs here and there to make ends meet. I'm afraid we are not hiring right now.
:'''Manager Kuan:''' Hmph. What will the Ministry do, if the hundreds of people under me really take to the streets to find work...

;(Talk to Manager Kuan again)
:'''Manager Kuan:''' *sigh* When will we be able to fully resume our work...
----
;(Talk to Nervous An)
:'''Nervous An:''' You're back. How have things gone?
:{{DIcon}} Do you know Atsuko?
:'''Nervous An:''' I believe you're referring to that lady from Inazuma who's been asking around about work. I remember her.
:'''Nervous An:''' Unfortunately, I don't think I'd have any work suited for her. As you've seen before, my data and forms all require more experienced hands.
:'''Nervous An:''' Even if the Ministry of Civil Affairs were to transfer clerks over to us, they would still need some training to be able to do the job well. They'd just drag us down, otherwise.
:'''Nervous An:''' It's especially difficult to look for fresh hires at a time like this, so apologize, but I don't have work for that young lady right now.

;(Talk to Nervous An again)
:'''Nervous An:''' Everything's happening all at once. What a mess...
----
;(Talk to Clerk Zhao)
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' This one doesn't tally... neither does this one... And this one's requested an extension...
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' Do I really have to go and chase them myself before these forms will be completed!?
:{{DIcon}} What's happening...
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' Not much. It's just a whole stack of forms that don't have anyone to take charge of them right now. If I don't slap them down on some tables myself, everyone just asks for extensions.
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' There are so many other things I need to do right now, what with the situation in Liyue and all. How am I supposed to take the time out to rush these people?
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' The Ministry of Civil Affairs can't spare any people either, so these forms are just stacking up and turning into an eyesore!
:{{DIcon}} Does chasing forms need any special skills?
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' Special skills? No, not really. I've already written the details of the request and their deadlines down. I just need someone to get those forms in front of the appropriate people.
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' If the forms arrive and those people still don't want to settle them or ask for delays, and thus cause our work to not be completed on time...
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' Hmph. They can explain themselves to the Ministry of Civil Affairs later.
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' So, do you want to help? Or do you know someone who can? I welcome both.
:{{DIcon}} I know a friend who can help.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' That's great. Get them to come here and report to me. The quicker these are all settled, the better.
:{{DIcon}} Would someone from Inazuma do?
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Earnestness and responsibility. That's all I ask.
::'''Clerk Zhao:''' Is your friend willing to help? Great. Ask them to report here directly. The sooner these forms are cleared, the better.

;(Talk to Clerk Zhao again)
:'''Clerk Zhao:''' We need to settle all these matters as quickly as possible...
----
;(Report back to Atsuko)
:'''Atsuko:''' So, did they reply?
:{{DIcon}} Clerk Zhao has work for you...
:'''Atsuko:''' That's great! What is it, specifically? ...Chasing forms... I've never heard of such work.
:'''Atsuko:''' Liyue really is a completely different place from Inazuma.
:'''Atsuko:''' But I'll give it <!--my-->all, regardless of what work this is!
:'''Atsuko:''' Thank you so much. I'll make some preparations first, and then I'll report for work.
:'''Atsuko:''' With this, I can finally take a step towards carving out a new life for myself.

;(Talk to Atsuko again)
:'''Atsuko:''' Truly, Liyue is a bustling city. I mean, so is Inazuma...
:'''Atsuko:''' But the feeling that the two cities give off in their daily "bustle" is completely different.
:'''Atsuko:''' I can't say it in a way that you would understand, but you'll see what I mean, should you ever get the chance to go to Inazuma.
:'''Atsuko:''' That said... I'd say it's best that you don't go to Inazuma. I don't mean to speak ill of my homeland, but Inazuma isn't a very suitable place for traveling at present.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Return to Nervous An===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Nervous An)
:'''Nervous An:''' How have things gone? Have you finished settling matters?
:{{DIcon}} I have.
:'''Nervous An:''' Thank you. Now, leave the rest to me. Apart from our work with the outlanders, the Ministry of Civil Affairs is also calming the local populace even as we speak.
:'''Nervous An:''' I do not know how much good we're doing, but I say that in such times, we should all do what we can.
:'''Nervous An:''' Take this as thanks for your work. You're also a guest from afar, but your timing was truly unfortunate...
:'''Nervous An:''' I can only hope that this will all blow over soon...
