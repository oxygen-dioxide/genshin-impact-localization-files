|text = [[Sumeru]] doesn't have a special day dedicated to book reading, which provides some people with a convenient excuse to never set their eyes on physical books for good.

Speaking of which, [[Paimon]] seems interested in reading. She may be able to find a few books suited to her interests in the [[House of Daena]].

Reading through them will set her apart from many others.
