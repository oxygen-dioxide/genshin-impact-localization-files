'''Il Capitano''', also known as '''Thrain''' and by his codename "'''The Captain''',"<ref name="lazzo video description" /> was the First of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].<ref name="First">{{Ref/Quest|A Decision (Archon Quest)}}</ref>

Initially opposing [[Mavuika]]'s plans to save [[Natlan]], Capitano later offered his support to her efforts in defeating the [[Abyss]]. Following [[Gosoythoth]]'s defeat at the hands of Mavuika and the [[Traveler]], Capitano sacrificed himself by transferring his life force to the [[Lord of the Night]] in place of Mavuika, making use of the curse of immortality placed upon him and all [[Khaenri'ah]]ns by [[Ronova]] to supply the Lord of the Night eternal life to repair Natlan's [[Ley Line]]s.

Without his life force, Capitano's body remains dormant on the [[Throne of the Primal Fire]] atop [[Ochkanatlan]].

==Profile==
Capitano enjoyed a high reputation amongst the Fatui for his strength, skill as a commander, and moral integrity. Lower-ranked members referred to him as "the ever-righteous Captain" and "the nigh-invincible Captain,"<ref name="Scara">{{Ref/VO|Wanderer|About The Captain}}</ref> with some stating that they would prefer to work under him, if they had the choice.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tales of Winter}}</ref> The elite soldiers under Capitano's command, much like himself, also held themselves to firm moral standards.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Ororon|5}}</ref>

The [[Wanderer]], however, views such attributes negatively and points out that holding "absolute righteousness" is a potential hazard.<ref name="Scara" /> Similarly, [[Guthred]], Capitano's former second-in-command, claimed that whenever he indulged in his sense of honor, it would result in him losing his chance to win. Though he and Capitano shared different views on justice, Capitano tolerated them, seeing that their differences made them the perfect partners.

Being the First of the Fatui Harbingers, Capitano had powers rivaling that of a god. However, by the time the Traveler met him, he was in a weakened state due to the curse of immortality causing his body to "decay." Despite this, he was still immensely powerful &mdash; the Pyro Archon [[Mavuika]] told him that, during their fight, she felt as if she was fighting the pinnacle of human strength, and she considers them so evenly matched that a true battle between them could go either way.<ref name="AOWWSS">{{Ref/Quest|As One We Watch the Setting Sun}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Capitano is a tall man with a rather large build. He has glowing dark blue eyes<ref name=":0">{{Ref/CS|Mika|4}}</ref> and long black hair that protrudes from the back of his helmet and over his shoulders. His helmet obscures his face, which he mentions is in a state of "decay" and disfigurement.<ref name="AOWWSS" /> While Capitano reveals his face to the Traveler and Paimon to show the suffering that the Ruler of Death inflicted on them (surprising both), it is obscured from the player. He wears a typical Snezhnayan winter coat, which he takes off during battle. Underneath the coat, he wears a black bodysuit with golden chains and accessories. Capitano also wears a pair of clawed gauntlets.

Prior to and during the Cataclysm, he wore a similar attire to [[Halfdan]], although with a black eight-pointed star, shoulder guards, and a silver aiguillette on his right arm.<ref name="WABM">{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref>

==Story==
Capitano, known by his real name Thrain prior to becoming a Fatui Harbinger, originally hailed from [[Khaenri'ah]] where he served as a Commander. Similarly to [[Pierro]], he was aware of [[Dainsleif]] and the [[Traveler's Sibling]], having seen the two together as the last time he saw Dainsleif. When the cataclysm hit Khaenri'ah, Thrain watched as his nation, family, and allies fell to the Abyss, deeply scarring him. After putting up some resistance, he realized that the situation in Khaenri'ah was unsalvageable and fled with the remnants of his platoon to Natlan. At the time, many people viewed those from Khaenri'ah with suspicion due to believing they were responsible for the disaster, though he befriended the chief of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] at the time, [[Ayizu]], who treated him with respect. The two fought countless battles against the Abyss, but Ayizu eventually died. Before his death, he told Thrain about the secret of the Pyro [[Gnosis]], which caused him to resent [[Mavuika]] for not fulfilling her oath and prolonging the inevitable. Thrain's heart was also modified to convert memories and souls into knowledge from the Ley Lines, and throughout his journeys, he would absorb countless souls which he hoped to release into the Ley Lines to grant them peace.

He was able to survive and became cursed with immortality as with all other pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns, eventually joining the Fatui as the Capitano, the First of the Fatui Harbingers.

Following the death of fellow Harbinger [[Crucabena]], Capitano was in attendance along with [[Scaramouche]] and [[Signora]] as [[Pierro]] appointed [[Arlecchino]] as Crucabena's replacement.<ref name="The Song Burning in the Embers">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/tN5JACOEJFM ''"The Song Burning in the Embers" Full Animated Short'']</ref>

After Signora's death at the hands of the [[Raiden Shogun]], a funeral for her was held in [[Snezhnaya]]. Capitano, along with the other Harbingers barring Scaramouche, was in attendance, where he questioned [[Il Dottore]] on the situation with Scaramouche and the [[Gnosis|Electro Gnosis]].

During [[Varka]]'s expedition when [[Mika]] was accompanying them, the knights accidentally ran into several Fatui scouts, resulting in a tense situation when Capitano was eventually alerted of the situation alongside Varka. The two eventually met and agreed to peacefully depart, with Varka stating that he would have loved to duel him under different circumstances.<ref name=":0" />

===In-Game===
During the event of ''[[Of Ballads and Brews]]'', Varka's letter to the [[Knights of Favonius]] revealed that he and his expedition encountered Il Capitano. Despite the Fatui's previous transgressions against Mondstadt during the events of the {{Quest|Prologue}}, the two sides remained cordial to each other and some of Capitano's actions actually helped the expedition. At the time Varka wrote his letter, Capitano had just left for [[Natlan]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sounds From Afar (Quest)}}</ref>

After [[Fontaine]]'s [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophecy]] was averted, [[Neuvillette]] informs the [[Traveler]] that Capitano had joined the conflicts occurring in Natlan, having learnt this information through his dealings with Arlecchino.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Finale}}</ref>

Upon arriving, Capitano was implied to begin to experiment with [[Phlogiston]], having a group of his subordinates capture the local Saurians for the purpose. His arrival was noted by the locals, who began referring to him as a "big deal." His primary goal was to look for [[Citlali]], eventually meeting [[Ororon]] in order to figure out where she was, as they belonged to the same tribe. Ororon, sensing his intentions, refused, and Capitano was able to tell he was lying. Ororon began to trail Capitano to figure out why he was looking for her, and while he noted his presence, let him be. Eventually, he decided to confront Mavuika, during which Ororon sensed a feeling akin to a soul trying to escape. Capitano would lose the clash with her yet before they could continue their fight Ororon would intervene at the most critical moment, allowing Capitano to escape. 

In a secret cave, Ororon wanted to sacrifice his life for Natlan and he believes that Capitano was the key to showing him the way. During this time, a subordinate named [[Rezanov]] told him that the Pyro Archon was also weakened and asks if they should take the Gnosis, but he refused, having acknowledged his defeat to her. Capitano revealed to Ororon that he was looking for Citlali as she could communicate with the [[Wayob]] and thus the [[Night Kingdom]]. He initially refused to tell him the plan, but Ororon reminded him that he had saved his life and could tell that he had a sense of justice in him. This convinced Capitano to disclose his ideas to him, and the two ultimately decided that the best way to resolve Natlan's crisis was to reconstruct the nation's Ley Lines. To make this plan a reality, Capitano learned of a Source Mechanism and ordered his subordinates to acquire it, which they did after compiling notes from several researchers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Flickering Light Splits in Twain}}</ref>

Realizing that Capitano's plan would be just as disastrous as using the Gnosis, Mavuika, [[Xilonen]] and the Traveler would infiltrate the ruins where the Source Mechanism was held, while [[Kinich]] distracted the garrison outside. Ororon activated the mechanism, but soon became possessed by another entity, who Capitano recognized and stopped. The soul addressed Capitano as "Commander" and lamented the fact that he upheld his values over victory before being expelled. The plan did not rework the Ley Lines, but instead awakened the [[Lord of the Night]]. Capitano later revealed that his plan was meant to prevent Natlan from suffering the same fate as Khaenri'ah, though with Ororon being acknowledged by his [[Ancient Name]], he eventually agreed to Mavuika's plan, seeing that it had the potential for the best outcome and offered his subordinates for her use.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref>

Capitano and his subordinates assisted Mavuika in repelling the Abyss when they invaded, though his men took immense casualties defending the people. After the Abyss was repelled, Capitano attended the victory feast, where Mavuika expressed her thanks to him and his forces. Capitano later visited the Lord of the Night, asking her to help him for the sake of the fallen Natlan people and to save Natlan, aware that Mavuika had used [[Ronova]]'s powers and would die as a result of using them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Fuel Named "Fate"}}</ref>

After the invasion, Capitano visited the Feather-Flower Clan and gave them the [[Draught of Lucidity]], which was developed by Guthred and helped cure the worst cases of Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome. Capitano then spoke to the Traveler and Paimon in a private conversation, where he revealed that his work was not yet done in the nation, though he did not disclose any more details to them, stating it was largely personal matters. When the Ruler of Death was brought up by the Traveler, Capitano decided to reveal his true face beneath his helmet to them to showcase his disdain for the Ruler of Death for what she did to him and his people. Afterward, Capitano said his goodbyes and departed after [[Iansan]] arrived to inform the Traveler of their Ancient Name being forged by Xilonen.<ref name="For the Same Land" />

When Ronova demanded Mavuika's death for using her powers, the Lord of the Night was reluctant to do so. She instead revealed that another was coming to take her place, revealed to be Capitano. Capitano expressed his disdain towards Ronova for causing the people of Khaenri'ah to suffer when it was only the [[Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah|Five Sinners]], and replaced Mavuika as the death the shade desired. Due to the curse of immortality that she had placed on him, it would create a paradox that could unravel the rules of the world, hoping that she would either forsake her rule or live with it. Ronova ultimately decided to uphold the rule, and Capitano transferred his immortal life force to the Lord of the Night, permanently preventing the Lord of the Night from dying. His body would remain seated on the [[Throne of the Primal Fire]], and his consciousness was sent to the Night Kingdom. Mavuika and the others commemorated Capitano's sacrifice by engraving him in a monument dedicated to the fallen near the Masters of the Night-Wind, and one of his subordinates, [[Rotchev]], attended the service, stating that he would forever serve as an example for the rest of his soldiers. Though no longer able to partake in Fatui activity, the Tsaritsa kept his ranking intact.<ref name="WABM" />
