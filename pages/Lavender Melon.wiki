'''Lavender Melons''' are a [[Cooking Ingredient]] commonly found in the wild all over [[Inazuma]].

==How to Obtain==
Lavender Melons grow in groups of three on [[Cuihua Wood|Cuihua Trees]] in Inazuma, and can be harvested by either climbing or hitting the tree to make them fall within the player's reach. Dropped Lavender Melons may also be found on crates and tables of urbanized areas. They are most commonly found around [[Konda Village]], [[Kujou Encampment]], [[Jakotsu Mine]] and [[Bourou Village]].

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A fruit with gorgeous skin. The flesh within transforms into food with a unique mouthfeel when cooked.<br>In Inazuma, there is a traditional art that involves using the outer skins of these fruits to make dye. They say that [[Konda Village]] once planted Lavender Melons and that they were famed for their secret "Konda Dye" art, by which they produced truly lovely fabric.}}

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* The Lavender Melon is mentioned in Volume 6 of [[Someone's Diary]]. According to the author, lavender melons tastes astringent and eating the skin turned his teeth and tongue purple.
* Lavender Melons can be roasted. This is eaten as a snack in Inazuma, often with fish.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Like Rhyme and Song, the Summer Reverie (Quest)}}</ref>
** Kuki Shinobu's version of Roasted Lavender Melon secretly involves coating the melons in [[slime]] ooze before cooking it, an idea she had gotten from [[Xiangling]] at [[Wanmin Restaurant]].<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kuki Shinobu|2}}</ref>
* Despite not being flowers at all, Lavender Melons are often used in the making of "Flower" paints, one of the two types of paint traditionally used in Inazuma.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Painted Vision: Stunning Waters}}</ref>
* During the events of the Archon Quest Interlude ''[[Perilous Trail]]'', [[Arataki Itto]] regularly calls Paimon a "Flying Lavender Melon" after an initial argument between the two.

===Etymology===
* The Lavender Melon may be based on the real life fruit, the purple ''{{w|Akebia}}''. This fruit is commonly found in Japan and acts as an indicator of the changing seasons when it "blooms." The fact that it is never seen "blooming" in-game may be a nod to Inazuma's theme of eternity.
* The Japanese localization's name for this fruit, {{ja|スミレウリ|rm=Sumire Uri}}, is a phonetic spelling of the Japanese reading for the fruit's Chinese name, {{zh|菫瓜|rm=Jǐn Guā}}.
** {{Lang|"Sumire"|ja=スミレ/菫}} refers to the flower ''{{w|Viola mandshurica}}'', which is a species of violet.
