:'''Kimiya:''' Is this interpretation based on...
:{{DIcon|Alchemy}} May I use the [[Crafting Bench]] here?
::'''Kimiya:''' Ah, sure, go ahead. I was thinking about something else anyways...

:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Kimiya:''' I won, haha! If only I could perform divination using Genius Invokation TCG cards...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Kimiya:''' Well... Is this what the bad omen that I read today meant?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Kimiya:''' Lately, I've been studying something called "[[Alchemical Divination]]."
::'''Kimiya:''' You rely on intuition to randomly choose some things to conduct alchemy on. If it fails — and, of course, most of the time it does fail — the ashes are used in divination.
::'''Kimiya:''' It's pretty much the same principle as divination of coffee grounds or leftover tea leaves.
::'''Kimiya:''' I've noticed that the girls in my class are really interested in that sort of thing, so there's no reason that Alchemical Divination shouldn't be just as popular, right?
:;(Before [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::{{DIcon}} Is this a personal interest or is it purely academic?
:::'''Kimiya:''' Ahem... Can't it both?
:::'''Kimiya:''' My mentor kept shaking their head after I said that according to legend, Alchemical Divination was invented by [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. But I don't think it's time to give up yet.
:::'''Kimiya:''' I just need to workout the rationale for this interpretation, even the tiniest one. Then I can go back and discuss it with my mentor!
:;(After [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::{{DIcon}} Is this interest personal or academic?
:::'''Kimiya:''' Ahem... Can't it both?
:::'''Kimiya:''' When I said that "legends hold that this was invented by Lesser Lord Kusanali," my mentor did have a doubtful look, but I didn't get rejected outright, so I reckon that it's too early to give up yet!
:::'''Kimiya:''' I just need to work out some rationale for this interpretation, even if it's a flimsy one. Then I can go back and discuss it with my mentor!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kimiya:''' Ugh, but why?
