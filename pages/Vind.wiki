==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Vind is descended from an [[Vind's Family|unnamed family]] which has been serving as sentries for at least a thousand years, keeping watch for storms at Stormbearer Point at [[Vennessa]]'s behest. However, it has been many generations since anyone has seen a true storm, thanks to [[Barbatos]]' power maintaining gentle winds over the land of Mondstadt. Nevertheless, Vind is devoted to her duty and goes to sometimes extreme lengths to perform it, such as preparing to charge up a watchtower overrun by [[hilichurls]] before the [[Traveler]] eliminates them to keep her safe.<ref name="New Storm" />

===Personality===
Vind has dedicated herself to her family's duty, continuing to keep watch for storms at Stormbearer Point despite the fact that none in her family have seen a true storm in many generations.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Vind:''' Could it be that you share my interest in storms?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Vind:''' It's so rare to find a traveler passing through a remote out-of-the-way place like this.
::'''Vind:''' I'm Vind, devoted follower of Lord Barbatos.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Vind:''' My family was given an order by Lady Vennessa. We are to keep watch here, looking out over the sea for any sign of an oncoming storm.
::'''Vind:''' For generations, everyone in my family has felt honored to have this duty.
::'''Vind:''' We see it as our life's purpose to be signal beacons for Mondstadt, ready to spread the message to every corner of Mondstadt at the first sign of a storm.
::'''Vind:''' But... That's all in the past, now.
::{{DIcon}} The past?
:::'''Vind:''' As you can see, looking from the watchtower, the seas around Mondstadt are calm and peaceful.
:::'''Vind:''' Since those days went by, Lord Barbatos has been protecting Mondstadt. There have been no storms ever since.
:::'''Vind:''' Even our family has not seen a true storm for many generations.
::{{DIcon}} So why do you still keep watch here?
:::'''Vind:''' Maybe it's because every beacon longs for its time to shine.
:::'''Vind:''' Even if I knew for certain that there would never be a single storm again, once in a while my mind would be drawn to the stories they used to tell in my father's generation...
:::'''Vind:''' The way our ancestors would defiantly blow the horn in the middle of a raging storm, sending a warning signal to all in Mondstadt...
:::'''Vind:''' And when I come back out of my imagination... I would find that I had walked all the way here, without realizing."
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Tell me about your family.
:::'''Vind:''' For a majority to live a life of peace, a minority of people must make great sacrifices. My family belongs to this minority.
:::'''Vind:''' But this we have known since the day that we received orders from Lady Vennessa herself.
:::'''Vind:''' ...Have you heard of Barbatos Ratatouille? It is said to have been one of the dishes served at the feast held in celebration after Vennessa defeated the old aristocracy.
:::'''Vind:''' My forebears had the honor of dining with Vennessa that day. After the feast, an accomplished chef was invited to taste the dish and infer the recipe.
:::'''Vind:''' The taste is like the gentle caress of the breeze on your cheeks, and you can almost feel the peace and freedom given by Barbatos welling up inside your heart... That dish has kept our family going over the centuries as we watch out for storms, day in, day out.
:::'''Vind:''' ...Thank you for listening to me. In fact, here, please have the recipe. It's my pleasure to share the joy of this wonderful dish with you.
::;(Obtain [[Recipe: Barbatos Ratatouille]].)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Vind:''' Farewell, unknown traveler.
::'''Vind:''' May Barbatos' gentle wind be with you.
