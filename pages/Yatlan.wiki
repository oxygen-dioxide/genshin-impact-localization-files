:'''Capac:''' Hah! Hey!
:'''Capac:''' {{sic|hey}} there, are you helping me keep count?
:'''Yatlan:''' Of course! I come from a business family. Wouldn't it be weirder if I didn't know how to do that?
:'''Yatlan:''' C'mon, there's just one-third of the training assignment left to complete.
:'''Capac:''' And one-third is... How much?
:'''Yatlan:''' Oh, don't worry about it. I'll remember it for you. You just concentrate on your exercise.
:'''Yatlan:''' Hurry it up! Once you're finished, we can go chow down on some volcano cake!
:'''Capac:''' You got it! Volcano cake always tastes best after training!
:'''Yatlan:''' Wrong! Volcano cake is great to eat any day of the week!
