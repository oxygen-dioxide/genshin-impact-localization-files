==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' Hello there, dear customer! Welcome!
:'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' We currently have an ongoing event at our store with prizes to be won. Interested?
:{{DIcon}} Well, let's see what you've got...
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' Of course. We have a special selection brought in from [[Watatsumi Island]] for your perusal!
::;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} What do you sell here?
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' See, I'm from Watatsumi Island, and I opened this stall here in Ritou with my trademark being these round and radiant Watatsumi Pearls. Perfect for gifts or for wearing in your hair.
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' Some of my fishermen friends from Watatsumi Island also send unagi here to be sold. I'm from a fishing family myself, so it goes without saying that I'll lend some neighbors a hand, you know what I mean?
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' Our unagi is well-priced, and it's a mighty rare sight here in Ritou, so it's sold pretty well, haha! Small profits and quick turnover, that's how you stay in business for a long time.
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' Oh, right. I've also brought some old relics that some of my ancestors fished out of the sea some time back. If you're a customer of finer tastes, you can have a look at those.
:{{DIcon}} Prizes to be won, you say?
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' That's right, we're giving out prizes for store names!
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' I wanted to come up with a catchy name and also get some publicity at the same time, so this is my two-in-one solution.
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' The clients here were very enthusiastic, and they gave me a lot of suggestions.
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' It's just that, well... Most of the names have been something too, uh, special. Like "The Watatsumi Pearl," the "Nagi-Nagi," "Tumbly-Round-Super-Shiny," and so on.
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' Standing out from the crowd is good, of course, but I reckon that it would be better if we went with something that has broad appeal, so I've yet to decide on a final name.
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' If you have any good ideas, please take part in the event as well!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Yamashiro Kenta:''' See you. Come again soon!
