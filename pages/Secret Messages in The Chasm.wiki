'''Secret Messages in The Chasm''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] located in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. It consists of finding nine purple rune phrases scattered throughout the underground mines. Finding all nine will grant the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[The Nine-Word Rumor]]''.

The messages disappear while the player has the energized [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]] equipped in their proximity. To interact with the messages, the player must have it unequipped or drained of energy.

==Trivia==
* The secret messages are written in the [[Latin-Based Language]]. For deciphered text and translations, see [[Latin-Based Language/Texts#The Chasm|Latin-Based Language/Texts ยง The Chasm]].
* The secret messages found near the two bells are related to the Abyss Lectors fought later. There are two messages near each bell, one mentions the name and the other mentions the title.
** Northwestern bell: Imp Agnarr "Imperator (Commander) Agnarr" Mortuos plango "I mourn for the dead"
** Southeastern bell: Pivs Egill "Pious Egill" Vivos voco "I call the living"
