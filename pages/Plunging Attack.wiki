'''Plunging Attacks''' are performed by pressing the [[Normal Attack]] button while airborne. A standard jump on a generally flat surface does not usually give enough altitude to perform a plunging attack, so additional height is needed to achieve this.

==Types of Plunging Attack DMG==
Plunging Attacks can deal DMG in three different ways:
* '''Plunge DMG:''' Dealt once every 0.3s while falling mid-air in a 1m radius around the character.
* '''Low Plunge DMG:''' Dealt when the character lands after plunging from heights lower than or equal to 2.4m.
* '''High Plunge DMG:''' Dealt when the character lands after plunging from heights greater than 2.4m. Deals greater DMG, [[Poise DMG]], and [[knockback]] than Low Plunge.

==Plunging Height==
{{See also|Area of Effect|Measurement}}
Certain characters' [[Elemental Skill]]s or [[Elemental Burst]]s can give players the height needed to perform plunging attacks. Note that ''heights are approximate'' and are measured in [[meter]]s. Jump heights are measured from the ground to the character's feet when at max height.

Characters do not need [[stamina]] to perform a plunging attack while in the air, so this can potentially save the character from [[Fall Damage]] because plunging attacks limit the amount of health that can be lost (compared to falling without plunging). For example, suppose the character runs out of stamina while [[gliding]]. In that case, the character can perform a plunging attack before hitting the ground to avoid or reduce fall damage, depending on the altitude. Note that Xiao's Plunging Attack will always nullify fall damage regardless the height.

Still, characters cannot perform plunging attacks if they transition to a free fall by running out of stamina while climbing or being interrupted while in the air (such as being hit by attacks).

==Plunging Attack Modification==
===Talents===
These are talents that grant additional effects to plunges (besides [[Elemental Infusion]]s, which also infuse plunging attacks). Note that Xiao not taking fall damage from Plunging is part of his Normal Attack [[Whirlwind Thrust]].

===Constellations===
These are constellations that grant additional special abilities to plunges.

==Domains==
Some events and domains granted special bonuses to plunging or were centered around plunging.
* [[Peculiar Wonderland]]
* [[Contending Tides]]
* [[Energy Amplifier Initiation]]
* [[Battlefront: Misty Dungeon]], plunging trial
* Some versions of the [[Spiral Abyss]]

==Plunging AoE==
The following table documents the [[AoE]], [[poise]] damage, and [[impulse]] of plunging attacks. In general, the AoE and force of the Plunging Attack depends on the plunging height and weapon type. Mid-air refers to the Plunge damage done to targets mid-air (before hitting the ground).<ref>Community Article, Interruption Resistance, Data: [[Interruption Resistance/Data#Character Plunging Attacks|Plunging Attacks]]</ref>

==Notes==
* The Plunging Attack has sometimes been referred to as the ''Cannonball'' as in the [[Contending Tides/Gallery|Contending Tides]] challenge (Art of the Cannonball).
* The community term {{Lang|''[[Hitlag#Dragonstrike|Dragonstrike]]''|zh=登龙剑|zh_tl=Climbing-Dragon Sword}} refers to the ability of melee characters, especially tall claymore characters, to gain additional height by using the extra momentum gained by hit lag when hitting an entity to jump high enough to perform a plunging attack. The term has specifically been used to refer to Diluc performing plunging attacks and has less commonly been called the ''Xiaoluc'' (a portmanteau of Xiao and Diluc).
** ''Footstooling'' is a different method from dragonstriking, and involves the character jumping on an entity whose hitbox, upon collision, will allow the player to jump high enough to perform a plunging attack. This method, unlike Dragonstrike, is not limited to melee characters.
* [[Xiao]] can perform a plunging attack no matter his height above the ground after using his Elemental Skill, [[Lemniscatic Wind Cycling]], and will never take plunge damage. [[Kaedehara Kazuha|Kazuha]] can also ignore plunging attack height requirements for 10s after using [[Chihayaburu]].
* While in his [[Foul Legacy: Raging Tide]] stance, [[Tartaglia]] is unable to perform plunging attacks.
* While in the [[Takimeguri Kanka]] state, [[Kamisato Ayato]] is unable to perform plunging attacks.
* One can use [[Keqing]]'s [[Stellar Restoration]] to teleport to a high location and then plunging attack.
* One of [[Yae Miko]]'s tails briefly appears at the end of her plunging attack.
* [[Bow]] users fire a rain of arrows as part of their plunging attack.<!--see normal attack descriptions-->
* There is a glitch where characters can "infinite-plunge" attack on certain objects. That is, plunging on some things will cause one to enter a state of perpetual plunging, never passing through the object to reach the ground, with the spiraling plunging animation in limbo. This happens with [[polearm]] users and other characters as well.
* Hitting an opponent with a Plunging Attack after plunging for more than 5 seconds grants the player the "[[Geronimo!]]" [[achievement]].
