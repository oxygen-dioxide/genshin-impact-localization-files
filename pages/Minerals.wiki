'''Minerals''' are items that can be obtained from the open world that come in the form of ores.

Rich variants of [[Crystal Chunk]] and [[Noctilucous Jade]] ores can be found in the [[The Chasm/Underground Mines|Underground Mines]] of [[The Chasm]]. When mined, these ores drop an increased amount of minerals and will restore 3 energy to the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]]. These ores appear bigger than their regular counterparts and emit a glow.

As {{Geo}} objects, Minerals take [[Poise Damage]]. Different Minerals have different amounts of [[Shields|shield]] gauges. Every '''~71.429''' Poise Damage from [[Blunt Attack]]s will deplete 1 shield gauge from Minerals.

Below is a list of the amount of shield gauges each type of Mineral possesses.
