|description     = A seafood soup.
|desc_suspicious = The only flavor it has is the stench of fish. If your nose is still functioning properly, there must be something wrong with the soup... Ah wait, is it fish scales or gravel that got stuck in your teeth?
|desc_basic      = It originated in the fishing village Poisson. Fishermen used to process leftover fish by stewing them together. This soup then became popular in Fontaine due to its freshness. Nowadays, almost any type of aquatic product can be included in this dish.
|desc_delicious  = The buttery soup resembles gilded waves under the bright sun, as the rich seafood aromas melt in your mouth. The bounties of the ocean form a harmonious masterpiece. After emptying the bowl quickly, you can't help but dip the bread in what remains — it would be a great loss to miss even one drop of it!
