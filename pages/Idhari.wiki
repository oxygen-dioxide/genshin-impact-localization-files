==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Idhari:''' If someone can find an answer, that person is definitely me.
:{{DIcon}} An answer to what?
::'''Idhari:''' The biggest problem before me, the answer I seek is... Yes, it is [[The Withering]].
::'''Idhari:''' The issue of The Withering has been growing in severity lately, and it's spreading even more rapidly and further now.
::'''Idhari:''' There aren't many who have [[Vision]]s, so relying on them to resolve it won't really work.
::'''Idhari:''' So, it's my time to shine. It's my time to eliminate The Withering from its source!
::'''Idhari:''' Hehe, my reputation in the Akademiya will definitely rise once I've resolved such a major problem, and I may even get to be a sage!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Idhari:''' Just wait and see! I'll definitely succeed.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Idhari:''' New topic... a new topic... *sigh* Agh, come on!
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean "new topic"?
::'''Idhari:''' Do you know what we researchers fear the most?
::'''Idhari:''' We fear the loss of research direction, that's what!
::'''Idhari:''' Perhaps my luck is just terrible, but there is presently no need to pursue the topic that I was originally looking into.
::'''Idhari:''' And here I was looking to make a name for myself by solving a major problem... and would you look at that? It's all come to nothing!
::'''Idhari:''' This should be a time of opportunity! Four out of our six sage seats are empty! And here I am...
::'''Idhari:''' No. No, I can't give up just yet. They're not just going to flip a coin and pick a sage just like that!
::'''Idhari:''' As long as I can find a research topic more important and with more potential than the last, I've still got a chance...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Idhari:''' Yes. I'm not going to give up now!
