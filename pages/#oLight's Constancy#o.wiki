|description    = A streetlamp that can be found in [[Port Ormos]] and other areas. The post has a unique arc that was originally intended to prevent it from being knocked over by [[Sumpter Beast]]s, but as it turned out, Sumpter Beasts would still crash into the suspended lamps themselves when laden with goods. As such, they found that not only did this lamp post design not work, but in fact blocked roadside space. The related staff within the [[Akademiya]] have sought to replace the base of these lamp posts for remedial work, but these plans have not worked out due to budget constraints...
