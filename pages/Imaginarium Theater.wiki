'''Imaginarium Theater''' is a permanent combat gameplay and special [[domain]] challenge in the '''Theater Lobby''' (previously known as the Mysterious Room) of [[Mondstadt Library]], [[Mondstadt]]. [[Wolfy]] is the concierge of the library and was created by a mage.

To unlock Imaginarium Theater, the player must reach [[Adventure Rank]] 35 and complete the {{Quest|Unbegun, Unending Story}}.

==Overview==
===Cast===
In order to participate in Imaginarium Theater, the player must provide characters to use. Every stage requires four stage members, even if the player can complete the stage with less. Each character has two Vigor and one will be consumed after each stage. They cannot be used again under most circumstances once their vigor is completely depleted.

Like the [[Spiral Abyss]], once the selection has been finalized, the stats and levels of the characters given will stay the same; if any changes have to be made (such as swapping artifacts, or leveling talents), a new run must be started.

To help players choose cast members, all characters are assigned [[Character Role]]s, and each difficulty has recommendations for how many characters with the On-Field and Off-Field roles should be selected. However, these are only meant to be aids; players are free to ignore both these recommendations and the characters' assigned roles.

====Principal Cast====
Principal Cast members are part of the initial lineup of Opening Characters when starting the challenge. Players must choose between using their own (if they have them) or the Trial version of the character; Principal Cast members are not available as Supporting Cast members.

If the player possesses a Principal Cast Member, their HP, ATK and DEF are increased by 20% for the duration of the season, which applies both inside and outside the theater.

====Alternate Cast====
Alternate Cast members are used to replenish the Principal Cast. The amount the player must provide depends on the difficulty selected, and they must be of a minimum level in order to participate. Generally, these characters must be of a specific element (of which three elements are required).

Along with the mandatory elements, each season also allows four Special Guest Characters. These characters do not require the specific element needed by the Theater, though unlike Principal Cast members, the player '''must''' have them or select them as a Supporting Cast member in order for them to be used.

====Supporting Cast====
Supporting Cast characters are used to assist [[Friend]]s in their performances. Up to 7 characters can be set and can be used to assist up to a total of 15 times each season. The [[Traveler]] cannot be selected as a Supporting Cast character.

====Fantasia Flowers====
Fantasia Flowers are earned by completing challenges in battle and are used to trigger events.

===Events===
{{Main|Imaginarium Theater/Events}}

After each Battle Event is completed, the player can continue the challenge by reading the book once again. Up to five potential events can be selected; Climatic Showdowns will always consist of the boss stage itself with 4 random events. Outside of these milestones, up to 3 Battle Events and 2 random events are provided.

Random events (anything outside a Battle Event) require Fantasia Flowers to use, and brings players back to the selection menu once the decision is finalized. The player can reroll the events if they need to.

If the player is stuck on stage (due to undesirable lineups), they have the option to rewind their performance back to the end of the last Climatic Showdown (or start of the play if one has not been reached yet), resetting progress back to that checkpoint. This can be done a limited amount of times, and if the player continues to have undesirable lineups, they will need to finalize and reset the performance.

* Battle Events give [[Fantasia Flowers]].
* Companion Events invite characters to the Principal Cast by spending Fantasia Flowers.
* Wondrous Boon Events grant combat buffs to the party in exchange for Fantasia Flowers. Wondrous Boon Events were replaced with Brilliant Blessing Events in [[Version/5.0|Version 5.0]].
* Brilliant Blessing Events grants buffs related to [[Elemental Reaction]]s in exchange for Fantasia Flowers.
* Mystery Cache Events grant benefits related to Events or to the Cast in exchange for Fantasia Flowers in either Standard or Rare formats. Certain Events may have negative effects as well.

===Fantastical Blessings===
The six designated characters in the initial lineup will gain Fantastical Blessings outside of the Imaginarium Theater challenge.

===Blessing Levels===
Blessing Level is increased by obtaining Brilliant Blessings or bringing in additional characters. Every character added to the Alternate Cast above the required number increases Blessing Level by 2, and obtaining or upgrading any Brilliant Blessing increases Blessing Level by 1. During performance challenges, it increases the following [[attribute]]s:
* [[Max HP]] by <math>\text{Blessing Level} \times 800</math>.
* [[ATK]] by <math>\text{Blessing Level} \times 50</math>.
* [[DEF]] by <math>\text{Blessing Level} \times 50</math>.
* [[Elemental Mastery]] by <math>\text{Blessing Level} \times 20</math>.
The buff effects received by Special Guest Stars are increased by 100%.

===Toy Medals===
[[Toy Medal]]s are obtained by earning Performance Medals and can be exchanged at [[Wolfy]] for [[Photo Mode|photo]] poses called [[Thespian Trick]]s.

===Stella===
Stella are obtained by completing the Star Challenge in each Act. They are displayed on the [[Profile]].

While Stella are simply a performance measurement, obtaining a specific amount of Stella is required for the ''[[When the Stars Shine]]'' achievement series.
