==Pages From Some Lost Notes (I)==
(A few torn pages found in the ruins, as though ripped from the pages of a notebook.)<br>
...The "[[Azosite]]" gained through extracting and smelting the [[Element|elemental energy]] contained in the [[Ley Line]]s is not fundamentally different in nature from elemental energy, and it is impossible for it to break from the [[Heavenly Principles|rules]] that elemental energy must follow...<br>
...The [[Abyss]] can distort and pollute the elements of the [[gods]], and thus it can be said to hold a higher-order position in terms of rules when compared to elemental energy...<br>
...Though in my opinion, the ways these [[Khaenri'ah|cave-dwellers]] use the Abyss is far too primitive, which has caused their "evolution" to move in an uncontrollable direction...<br>
...But this does not imply that they completely lack effective applications...

==Pages From Some Lost Notes (II)==
(A few torn pages found in the ruins, as though ripped from the pages of a notebook.)<br>
...The [[Khvarena]] can reverse the influence of Abyssal power. This is exactly the same quality exhibited by the mysterious "[[Gray Crystal|crystal]]" that we mentioned previously...<br>
...But on the other hand, perhaps it is being influenced by the material the locals call "[[Amrita]]." The versatility of the power of Khvarena far exceeds that of any similar powers previously known to us...<br>
Though it is completely meaningless, but what if the smelting method used for Azosite was used to process Khvarena? Followed by using Abyss-created... a [[Arkhe|reaction]]...<br>
...Perhaps a true perpetual energy source like the one idealized by the [[Khaenri'ah]]ns could be created...<br>
...If the origin and properties of "Amrita" can be ascertained, then it may be possible to find a way to elevate the mortal and mundane to supreme purity...
