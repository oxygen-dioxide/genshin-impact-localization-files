|description     = A crab dish cooked in the ancient ways.
|desc_suspicious = The flour granules within have congealed like gravel, and have some crab shell mixed in. But compared to the blandness of the crab meat, the taste of crab shell is at least worth having a go at.
|desc_basic      = The crab has been chopped into pieces and battered with flour, before being stir-fried till golden and rich with flavor. It is worthy of the word "gold," whether in terms of appearance or quality.
|desc_delicious  = The aroma of the crab meat inundates the room the instant it leaves the frying pan, and a single bite fills one's palate with the countless rustic flavors of a fishing village hometown. It seems that such simple yet timeless village customs held the secret to this lavish, golden sumptuousness all along.
