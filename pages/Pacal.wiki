==Profile==
Pacal is the current chief of the [[Children of Echoes]] tribe. In his youth, he was a "dashing" young man who sought to be acknowledged by the [[Wayob]], but eventually discovered that he was not picked to inherit an [[Ancient Name]]. Depressed, Pacal began eating large amounts of food to cope with stress. He became rather renowned for his appetite, having eaten 71 servings of [[Glittering Gemstones]] in a competition.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Weary Inn Bulletin Board}}</ref> However, he soon became determined to help others and eventually became the chieftain of the tribe. When [[Kachina]] was selected by the Wayob to hold an Ancient Name, Pacal did the best he could to look after her. Pacal later asked [[Xilonen]] to make Kachina's Turbo Twirly for her.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kachina|About Xilonen}}</ref>

When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] initially arrived at [[Natlan]], they were brought to the tribe village by Kachina. Pacal was initially skeptical of their identities, having considered the [[Adventurers' Guild]] to be a "mixed" bag. Upon hearing their names however, he recognized them and apologized for failing to notice them, telling Kachina that she had unknowingly found a teacher worthy to learn from.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Natlan! A New Adventure}}</ref>

After Kachina was rescued from the [[Night Kingdom]], Pacal and several tribesmen headed to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] to celebrate her return. He later scolded [[Weqro]] after he tried to congratulate her, having known that he had left Kachina's team in advance and was not convinced by his excuse.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Past and Future}}</ref>

The Traveler and Paimon would later return to visit Pacal when [[Manqu]] asked him for permission to attempt a rite to clear the [[Xiuhcoatl|Flamelord's Blessing]] from [[Little One]]. Pacal refused, as it had been 500 years since someone had attempted it and all attempts had ended in failure. Pacal explained that in order to start, participants had to get permission from the Saurian's respective tribe chief &mdash; with Little One being a Tepetlisaurus, it meant that they needed his permission. Pacal advised them against following the rite out of concern for their safety, but neither the Traveler nor Little One wanted to. Respecting their decision, he asked them to fight him to test their resolve. He was promptly beaten, so Pacal gave them the Talisman of Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, a sign of recognition and blessed them for their journey ahead, reminding them to stay safe during the ordeal.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of the Bold}}</ref>

Pacal later oversaw his tribe's defense when the Abyss invaded Natlan, overseeing evacuation efforts alongside Kachina and Xilonen. Pacal was one of the last to evacuate, having stayed behind to cover the rear. Once the monsters were dealt with, they evacuated to the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, and he returned to his tribal lands to oversee recovery efforts when the monsters were driven off.

Pacal and the other chiefs later made their way to the Stadium of the Sacred Flame to convey their blessings to the Traveler and Mavuika before they descended into the Night Kingdom. When they emerged victorious, Pacal took part in the celebrations, gifting the Traveler several feather accessories as proof if their bravery and strength to the people of Natlan. He later saw a few people off as they left Natlan to explore other lands.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref>

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pacal:''' Is it just me, or is my belly not as big as it used to be?
:'''Pacal:''' *sigh* Think I was just imagining things.
:{{DIcon}} Good day.
::'''Pacal:''' Hello. I am the Chief of the Children of Echoes.
::'''Pacal:''' Hmm... I call myself the chief, but really, I much prefer looking after and supporting everyone than managing the details of their lives.
::{{DIcon}} So, about that stomach story...
::'''Pacal:''' Well... It's kind of a long story...
::'''Pacal:''' Basically, I was also once a dashing young man who dreamed of earning the [[Wayob]]'s acknowledgment and recognition.
::'''Pacal:''' And once I realized that an [[Ancient Name]] would be forever beyond my reach, food became my main way of coping with stress.
::'''Pacal:''' But I've made my peace with the matter of Ancient Names. Even if I can't fight, there are still other things that I can do to support everyone.
::'''Pacal:''' You know what our mantra says: no one fights alone. My determination is just like my weight &mdash; they are both here to stay.
:{{DIcon}} We meet again. ''(Available after completing Step 9 of ''[[Natlan! A New Adventure]]'')''
::'''Pacal:''' Hello there, my friend. How have you been doing lately? Has everything been going well?
::'''Pacal:''' Any friend of [[Kachina]]'s is a friend of our tribe. You will always be welcome here.
::'''Pacal:''' Of course, you're always welcome to visit the other tribes, too. It's always fun to go for a swim at the [[People of the Springs]], or go for a hot air balloon ride with the [[Flower-Feather Clan]].
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Thanks for your suggestion.
:::'''Pacal:''' Hey, come on, what's with all that politeness? We actually really like making friends with outsiders, you know.
:::'''Pacal:''' There's a lot we can learn from one another.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Hero's Wit|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} About fighting the [[Abyss]]... ''(Available after completing ''[[A Fuel Named "Fate"]]'')''
::'''Pacal:''' The credit for our previous victory against the Abyss belongs to every single person of Natlan. It was a great victory, yet undeniably a temporary one.
::'''Pacal:''' The [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]] has visited several times after the war, inquiring about our casualties and providing strong support for our reconstruction efforts.
::'''Pacal:''' However, she also emphasized that the Abyss has not yet been defeated once and for all, so we must stay vigilant.
::'''Pacal:''' Thank you too, for your care and contributions. I believe that as long as we all stay united, we will surely be able to persevere until victory is ours.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Pacal:''' See you around.
