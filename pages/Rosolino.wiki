:'''Rosolino:''' On the left is the Mail Room, and on the right is the Infirmary. Don't mix them up.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Rosolino/Building Cred|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Rosolino:''' Don't worry, you've still got plenty of time to work on your card skills. Although... I'll no doubt have even more, being in the Fortress of Meropide and all.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Rosolino:''' Not bad! You might look young, but you're clearly an old hand when it comes to cards!
:{{DIcon}} About the Mail Room...
::'''Rosolino:''' You pay with [[Credit Coupons|Coupons]]. Tell us the recipient and their address and we'll get the letter there, if it's in Fontaine. The letter can't be too long, and the content... well, work that out yourself.
::'''Rosolino:''' And I advise you not to inquire about anything else.
:{{DIcon}} About the Infirmary...
::'''Rosolino:''' If Dr. [[Arderne]] isn't there, he's probably in the production zone. I don't know any more than that.
:{{DIcon}} Okay, thanks.
::'''Rosolino:''' Don't mention it.
