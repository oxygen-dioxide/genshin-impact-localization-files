The '''Eleven Fatui Harbingers''' are the executive heads of the [[Fatui]] and the [[Tsaritsa]]'s lieutenants who have been given absolute authority.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> They also have had their abilities boosted with the [[Delusion]]s granted to them by the Tsaritsa, which makes them far more powerful than normal [[allogenes]]. Each Harbinger leads their own division within the Fatui.

==Overview==
The Eleven Harbingers are the most powerful and highest-ranking members of the Fatui, and are also all wealthy, politically influential members of [[Snezhnaya]]n society. According to [[Ekaterina]], the amount of money [[Childe]] has saved at the [[Northland Bank]] "boggles the mind," while [[Goth]] tells the [[Traveler]] that [[Pantalone]], the richest of all, rented out the entire [[Goth Grand Hotel]] in [[Mondstadt]] indefinitely for the Fatui's personal use and paid him upfront. Due to Childe's status as a Harbinger, the Fatui diplomats handling the aftermath of his summoning of [[Osial]] were unable to resolve the situation by handing him over to the [[Liyue Qixing]];<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> the Northland Bank instead had to pay reparations.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Smoke}}</ref>

Upon becoming a Harbinger, a person is given a new name and a codename.<ref name="Tartaglia CS 5" /> They are also assigned a ranking number, which is based both on the individual's power and their overall contribution to the Tsaritsa's cause in comparison to the other members.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|关于「少女」…|zh}}</ref><ref name="wanderer story 4">{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|4|quote=The Doctor would unlock the seal on his body, causing his abilities to greatly increase, to the point where he was a match for the lower-ranked Harbingers. [...] Much later, he would bring the results of his exploration back to Snezhnaya, gaining the sixth seat in the process.}}</ref> The top-ranked Harbingers, up to No. 3 ([[Columbina]]), possess powers which can rival the gods.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref> The Harbingers can also partake in a "wild" and "frenzied" banquet,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|1}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|4}}</ref> to which Pierro may personally invite prospective recruits.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref> Further information about this banquet is not known, but it may have something to do with the Harbingers' rankings.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|1|quote=He would depart, and after arriving in the distant north, would join the wild banquet of the Harbingers, working to win the sixth seat among them.}}</ref>

The Harbingers have disparate methodologies and motivations, which leads to frequent internal squabbling and a mutual lack of respect or trust among a number of its members. For example, during [[La Signora]]'s funeral, [[Pulcinella]] announced that work would be halted for only half a day to mourn her loss, a decision which met derision from [[Pantalone]]. [[Arlecchino]] rebuked both Harbingers with the implication that they were cowards compared to Signora, leading both Childe and [[Sandrone]] to each remark on the bickering. [[Il Capitano]] did not remark on the bickering, but did not speak highly of Signora either, saying that "[her] methods tarnished her honor." Pierro ultimately ended their banter by telling them to put an end to their "foolish theatrics."<ref name="lazzo">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]</ref> After being abandoned in [[Sumeru]] by [[Il Dottore]], [[Scaramouche]] stated that the Harbingers frequently use each other for their own ends and are more than willing to cut loose anyone who is deemed to have lost their value.<ref name="Night-Bird">{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref>

Most rank-and-file Fatui members hold respect for their commanding Harbinger, and several Fatui who were direct subordinates of a Harbinger expressed deep attachments to their Harbingers to the point of taking matters into their own hands to curry favor with them, do something they believe will benefit their Harbinger, or exact revenge if their Harbinger was killed.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Strongest Opponent! The Biggest Crisis!}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Dandelions Find Rest}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|New Beginning}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The Harbingers' titles are derived from the stock characters in {{w|Commedia dell'arte|''commedia dell'arte''}}, a type of Italian theater which uses masks to designate their character's role in the story.
** "{{w|Pierrot|Pierro}}" ("The Fool") is a sad clown, pining for love of Columbina, who usually breaks his heart and leaves him for Harlequin.
** "{{w|Il Dottore}}" ("The Doctor") is usually extremely rich and bombastic, loving the sound of his own voice. In ''commedia dell'arte'', he typically tries to interfere with the Innamorati ("The Lovers"). He is also closely linked to Pantalone.
** "{{w|Columbina}}" ("Little Dove") is a female servant who is often the "only functional intellect on the stage" as she does her best to get the Innamorati together.
** "{{w|Pulcinella}}" ("Rooster") is a self-centered self-preservationist who manipulates others to get what they want, always siding the winner and fearing nothing.
** "{{w|Scaramouche}}" ("Little Skirmisher") is usually an assortment of different villainous traits, but primarily unscrupulous and unreliable with a penchant for intrigue, which lands him into difficult situations.
** "{{w|Sandrone}}" ("Peasant") is a peasant who is boorish, but clever and cunning. He is seen as the spokesman of a humble people who are ill-treated, eternally hungry, and always using tricks to make ends meet.
** "{{w|La Signora}}" ("The Lady") is typically tough, beautiful, and calculating; she is also proud and enjoys mocking others. She typically manipulates Pantalone's wealth for her own ends.
** "{{w|Pantalone}}" ("Merchant") is greedy and uses his high social standing to push others around and interfere with their business. Oftentimes, he is the father of one of the Innamorati and tries to keep the two lovers apart.
** "{{w|Tartaglia (commedia dell'arte)|Tartaglia}}" ("Stutterer") speaks with a stutter. He is usually representative of the lower working class, but in some depictions of him, he is upper-middle class. He usually plays a comedic role in the story with his clumsiness and stuttering.
** "{{w|Il Capitano}}" ("The Captain") is a braggart who weaves tall tales about himself, and he only manages to convince people who know nothing about him. He is cowardly, greedy, and opportunistic, with little loyalty to any side.
** "{{w|Harlequin|Arlecchino}}" ("Harlequin") is an astute servant, often acting to thwart the plans of his master and pursuing his own love interest, Columbina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierro.
** Scaramouche's and Pierro's names use the francized names instead of the Italian ones, which are Scaramuccia and Pedrolino respectively.
* In Chinese and Japanese, the Harbingers' codenames are translations of the Italian commedia name, while the Italian name is their actual name among the Harbingers. In English and other language versions, their codenames and actual names have been used fairly interchangeably, although it has been used in a more standardized manner after the release of ''A Winter Night's Lazzo''.
