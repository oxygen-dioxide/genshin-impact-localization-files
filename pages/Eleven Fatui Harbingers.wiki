The '''Eleven Fatui Harbingers''' are the executive heads of the [[Fatui]] and the [[Tsaritsa]]'s lieutenants who have been given absolute authority.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> They also have had their abilities boosted with the [[Delusion]]s granted to them by the Tsaritsa. This makes them far more powerful than normal [[allogenes]]. Each Harbinger leads their own division within the Fatui.

==Overview==
The Eleven Harbingers are the most powerful and highest-ranking members of the Fatui. They are also all wealthy, powerful members of [[Snezhnaya]]n society; according to [[Ekaterina]], the amount of money [[Childe]] has saved at the [[Northland Bank]] "boggles the mind," while [[Goth]] tells the [[Traveler]] that [[Pantalone]] rented out the entire [[Goth Grand Hotel]] in [[Mondstadt]] for the Fatui's personal use and paid him upfront.

The Harbingers chose those in the Fatui who have proven themselves in their strength to become their direct subordinates. All of the Harbingers are revered by their subordinates and underlings, often addressing them "Lord" or "Lady," and try not to get on their bad side. Rank-and-file Fatui consider a sparring session with a Harbinger an honor.<ref name="teucer tour">{{Ref/Quest|Teucer's Terrific Tour}}</ref>

Each Harbinger is assigned a number, which is based on the raw capability of the individual.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|关于「少女」…|zh}}</ref> Upon joining the Harbingers, members also take up a new name as well as a title (also referred to as an alias or codename).<ref name="Tartaglia 5" />

The Harbingers appear to be rather divided in their methods and views across the Fatui. [[Il Capitano]] indicated that [[La Signora|Signora']]<nowiki/>s methods tarnished her honor  but that her sacrifice should still be seen as a great pity<ref name="lazzo">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]</ref>. Tartaglia expresses an open dislike of Signora's methods in front of the Traveler,<ref name="teucer tour" /> while [[Viktor]] states that he would rather work for [[Capitano]] if given the opportunity to choose,<ref name="Tales of Winter">{{Ref/Quest|Tales of Winter}}</ref> and that [[Scaramouche]] is universally disliked by everyone, including his fellow Harbingers.<ref name="Equivalent Exchange">{{Ref/Quest|Equivalent Exchange}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The Harbingers' titles are derived from the stock characters in {{w|Commedia dell'arte|''commedia dell'arte''}}, a type of Italian theater which uses masks to designate their character's role in the story.
** "{{w|Pierrot|Pierro}}" ("The Fool") is a sad clown, pining for love of Columbina, who usually breaks his heart and leaves him for Harlequin.
** "{{w|Columbina}}" ("Little Dove") is a female servant who is often the "only functional intellect on the stage" as she does her best to get the Innamorati together.
**"{{w|Pulcinella}}" ("Rooster") is a self-centered self-preservationist who manipulates others to get what they want, always siding the winner and fearing nothing.
** "{{w|Scaramouche}}" ("Little Skirmisher") is usually an assortment of different villainous traits, but is primarily unscrupulous and unreliable with a penchant for intrigue, which lands him into difficult situations.
** "{{w|La Signora}}" ("The Lady") is typically tough, beautiful, and calculating; she is also proud and enjoys mocking others. She typically manipulates Pantalone's wealth for her own ends.
** "{{w|Pantalone}}" ("Merchant") is greedy and uses his high social standing to push others around and interfere with their business. Oftentimes, he is the father of one of the Innamorati and tries to keep the two lovers apart.
** "{{w|Tartaglia (commedia dell'arte)|Tartaglia}}" ("Stutterer") speaks with a stutter. Usually he is representative of the lower working class, but in some depictions of him, he is upper-middle class. He usually plays a comedic role in the story with his clumsiness and stuttering.
** "{{w|Il Capitano}}" ("The Captain") is a braggart who weaves tall tales about himself, and he only manages to convince people who know nothing about him. He is cowardly, greedy, and opportunistic, with little loyalty to any side.
** "{{w|Il Dottore}}" ("The Doctor") is usually extremely rich and bombastic, loving the sound of his own voice. In ''commedia dell'arte'', he typically tries to interfere with the Innamorati ("The Lovers"). He is also closely linked to Pantalone.
** "{{w|Sandrone}}" ("Peasant") is a peasant who is boorish, but clever and cunning. He is seen as the spokesman of a humble people who are ill-treated, eternally hungry, and always using tricks to make ends meet.
** "{{w|Harlequin|Arlecchino}}" ("Harlequin") is an astute servant, often acting to thwart the plans of his master and pursuing his own love interest, Columbina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.
* In Chinese and Japanese, the Harbingers' aliases are translations of the Italian commedia name, while the Italian name is their actual name among the Harbingers. In English and other language versions, their aliases are the original Italian terms, with the current exceptions of Childe and Pulcinella.
** In English, Tartaglia calls "Childe" an "alias of sorts."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of Descension}}</ref> In Chinese, it is treated as a formal title, while in Japanese, it is called a codename.<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/Genshin_7/status/1277909098256756736 Childe VA announcement]</ref><ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/Genshin_7/status/1291675786064220160 La Signora VA announcement]</ref>
** Scaramouche's and Pierro's names use the francized names instead of the Italian ones, which are Scaramuccia and Pedrolino respectively.
