The '''Eleven Fatui Harbingers''' are the executive heads of the [[Fatui]] who have been given god-like authority by the [[Tsaritsa]], and with it, strength surpassing that of other mortals.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> They also have had their abilities boosted with the [[Delusion]]s granted to them by the Tsaritsa, which makes them far more powerful than normal [[allogenes]]. Each Harbinger leads their own division within the Fatui.

Currently, the Harbingers' collective mission is to obtain the other six [[Gnoses]], of which they have collected five.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Others|Fatui|quote=An organization from Snezhnaya that is loyal to the Tsaritsa. Its Harbingers are on the hunt for the Gnoses.}}</ref>

==Overview==
The Eleven Harbingers are the most powerful and highest-ranking members of the Fatui, and are also all wealthy, politically influential members of [[Snezhnaya]]n society. According to [[Ekaterina]], the amount of money [[Tartaglia|Childe]] has saved at the [[Northland Bank]] "boggles the mind," while [[Goth]] tells the [[Traveler]] that [[Pantalone]], the richest of all, rented out the entire [[Goth Grand Hotel]] in [[Mondstadt]] indefinitely for the Fatui's personal use by paying upfront. Due to Childe's status as a Harbinger, the Fatui diplomats handling the aftermath of his summoning of [[Osial]] were unable to resolve the situation by handing him over to the [[Liyue Qixing]];<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> the Northland Bank instead had to pay heavy reparations.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Smoke}}</ref>

Upon becoming a Harbinger, a person is given a new name and codename,<ref name="Tartaglia CS 5" /> which can be inherited from their previous holder.<ref name="momoyo">{{Ref/NPC|Momoyo|s=3|condition=after completion of ''[[The Very Special Fortune Slip]]''}}</ref> They are also assigned a ranking number, which is based both on the individual's power and their overall contribution to the Tsaritsa's cause in comparison to the other members.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|关于「少女」…|zh}}</ref><ref name="wanderer story 4">{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|4|quote=The Doctor would unlock the seal on his body, causing his abilities to greatly increase, to the point where he was a match for the lower-ranked Harbingers. [...] Much later, he would bring the results of his exploration back to Snezhnaya, gaining the sixth seat in the process.}}</ref> The top-ranked Harbingers, up to No. 3 ([[Columbina]]), possess powers which can rival the [[god]]s,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Decision (Archon Quest)}}</ref> and their powers are stronger than the Traveler's, up to No. 4 ([[Arlecchino]]).<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Into the Sunlight}}</ref>

The Harbingers partake in a "wild" and "frenzied" banquet,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|1}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|4}}</ref> to which [[Pierro]] may personally invite prospective recruits.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|1|quote=He would depart, and after arriving in the distant north, would join the wild banquet of the Harbingers, working to win the sixth seat among them.}}</ref> Further information about this banquet, whether its meaning is literal or figurative, is not known.

The Harbingers frequently use each other for their own ends and are more than willing to cut loose those who are deemed to have lost their value, as shown when [[Dottore]] abandoned [[Scaramouche]] after he acquired both the {{Dendro}} and {{Electro}} Gnoses from [[Nahida]].<ref name="Night-Bird">{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref> The Harbingers' disparate methodologies and motivations lead to frequent internal squabbling, as well as a mutual lack of respect or trust among a number of its members. According to [[Capitano]], the reason each Harbinger's methods can be so radically different despite sharing the same goal and leader is because the Tsaritsa allows them the freedom to "pursue the meaning of their existence." When the time comes, that freedom can take precedence over her orders.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As One We Watch the Setting Sun}}</ref>

This internal discord was notably shown during [[Signora]]'s funeral &mdash; the first gathering of all the Harbingers in a long time &mdash; where there were small arguments between several Harbingers before Pierro ordered them to stop their "foolish theatrics."<ref name="lazzo">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]</ref> Signora also showed little respect towards Childe and Scaramouche, both of whom had the same sentiment towards her. Later on, the Traveler observed Arlecchino and Childe casually trash-talking the other Harbingers behind their backs,<ref name="seabreeze">{{Ref/Quest|Sea Breeze Rendezvous}}</ref> and Arlecchino admits that if Dottore wasn't a Harbinger, she would have killed him long ago.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Arlecchino|About The Doctor}}</ref> Arlecchino and the [[House of the Hearth]] also deduce that [[Pulcinella]] and [[Pantalone]]'s decision to put them in the spotlight for [[Project Stuzha]] was also meant as a way to control them.

Pantalone is known to work closely with both Pulcinella<ref name="seabreeze"/> and Dottore.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Wanderer|About Regrator}}</ref> Dottore also worked with the previous Knave [[Crucabena]], and later made a proposal for a secret experiment with Arlecchino, although his involvement was minimal.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Birds in a Cage}}</ref>

Most rank-and-file Fatui members hold respect for their commanding Fatui Harbinger, expressing a deep attachment to the Harbinger they are under to the point of taking matters into their own hands to curry favor from them, acting in what they believe are in their Harbinger's best interests, or exacting revenge if the Harbinger they were the direct subordinates of was killed.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Strongest Opponent! The Biggest Crisis!}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Dandelions Find Rest}}</ref> Those who were loyal to a Harbinger that was replaced may also continue to pursue said Harbinger's goals.<ref name="momoyo" />

This would imply that the name "Arlecchino" can be passed down along with the title of "The Knave" and that Crucabena's name was also likely to be Arlecchino, even if she was not the Knave who set up the orphanage.

==Trivia==
* A common leitmotif can be heard in the [[soundtrack]]s related to the Harbingers. {{Transclude|Never-Ending Performance (Soundtrack)|HarbingerLeitmotif|section=1}}
* The backstories for Signora, Pierro, Pantalone, Dottore, and Scaramouche were first described in the [[Pale Flame]] [[Artifact]] set.
* Each time a Harbinger appears in-game for the first time, a dramatic still is shown, titled with the Harbinger's name, codename, and rank number. In the case of Scaramouche, his first appearance was during the {{Quest|What the Skies Conceal, the Water Reveals}}, which some players may have missed. In that case, the title is instead shown at his next appearance, during the {{Quest|Delusion (Quest)}}.

===Etymology===
* The Harbingers' titles are derived from the stock characters in {{it|{{w|commedia dell'arte}}}}, a type of Italian theater which uses masks to designate their character's role in the story.
** "{{w|Pierrot|Pierro}}" ("The Fool") is a sad clown who regularly gets made fun of by the others in {{it|commedia dell'arte}}. He pines for the love of Columbina, who usually breaks his heart and leaves him for Arlecchino.
** "{{w|Il Capitano}}" ("The Captain") is a braggart who weaves tall tales about himself, often only managing to convince people who knew nothing about him beforehand. He is cowardly, greedy, and opportunistic, with little loyalty shown to any side.
** "{{w|Il Dottore}}" ("The Doctor") is usually extremely rich and bombastic, loving the sound of his own voice to the point of going on rants. In {{it|commedia dell'arte}}, Il Dottore typically tries to interfere with the {{it|{{w|Innamorati}}}} ("The Lovers") as part of the {{it|Vecchi}} ("The Elders").
** "{{w|Columbina}}" ("Little Dove") is a female servant who is often called the "only functional intellect on the stage" as she does her best to get the Innamorati together.
** "{{w|Harlequin|Arlecchino}}" ("Harlequin") is an astute servant and trickster, usually acting to thwart the plans of his master and pursuing his own love interest, Columbina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierro.
** "{{w|Pulcinella}}" ("Rooster") is a fearless and egotistical self-preservationist who manipulates others to get what he wants. In a fight between sides, he always sides with the winner.
** "{{w|Scaramouche}}" ("Little Skirmisher") is usually an assortment of different villainous traits, but primarily unscrupulous and unreliable with a penchant for intrigue, which lands him into difficult situations.
** "{{w|Sandrone}}" ("Peasant") is a peasant who is boorish, but clever and cunning. He is seen as the spokesman of a humble people who are ill-treated, eternally hungry, and always using tricks to make ends meet.
** "{{w|La Signora}}" ("The Lady") is typically tough, beautiful, and calculating; she is also proud and enjoys mocking others. La Signora typically manipulates Pantalone's wealth for her own ends.
** "{{w|Pantalone}}" ("Merchant") is greedy and uses his high social standing to push others around to interfere with their business. Oftentimes, Pantalone is the father of one of the {{it|Innamorati}} and tries to keep the two lovers apart.
** "{{w|Tartaglia (commedia dell'arte)|Tartaglia}}" ("Stutterer") speaks with a stutter. He is usually representative of the lower working class, but in some depictions of Tartaglia, he is upper-middle class. Tartaglia usually plays a comedic role in the story with his near constant clumsiness and stuttering.
** Scaramouche's and Pierro's names use the francized names instead of the Italian ones, which are Scaramuccia and Pedrolino respectively.
* In Chinese and Japanese, the Harbingers' codenames are translations of the Italian {{it|commedia}} name, while the Italian name is their actual name among the Harbingers. In English and other language versions, their codenames and actual names have been used fairly interchangeably, although it has been used in a more standardized manner after the release of ''A Winter Night's Lazzo''.
