{{Description|Lately, elemental life forms known as [[Specters]] have been appearing in large numbers across [[Inazuma]]. [[Katheryne]] in Inazuma City is commissioning adventurers to gather information on this unusual occurrence.}}
'''Spectral Secrets''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 2.1]].

During the event, complete the "Spectral Secrets" expedition commissions to earn Primogem rewards. Depending on which characters you dispatch, you can also earn rewards such as Sanctifying Unction, Talent Level-Up Materials, Character EXP Materials, and even bonus rewards.

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* Event Duration: 2021/09/19 10:00:00 – 2021/09/26 03:59:59
* Reward Collection Time: 2021/09/19 10:00:00 – 2021/09/29 03:59:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 30 or above
* Complete the [[Archon Quest]] "[[Ritou Escape Plan]]" and the "[[Floating Spirits &mdash; The Investigation Begins]]" quest given by Inazuma's [[Katheryne]]

===Summary===
* During this event, [[Katheryne]] of the [[Adventurer's Guild]] will release seven investigative expedition commissions for "Spectral Secrets" each day, of which you can select four.
* One S-rank commission, two A-rank commissions, and four B-rank commissions will refresh each day. S-Rank expedition commissions require you to complete the open-world challenge "Preliminary Investigation" first, after which you can initiate the expedition.
* For each commission, Travelers may enlist one character belonging to a friend on their friend list for every expedition in "Spectral Secrets" as a supporting character. Supporting characters will increase the chance of obtaining additional rewards. Supporting characters may be selected from any of the characters in a friend's Character Showcase.
* Travelers can recall dispatched characters. Recalled characters will not obtain rewards, but the number of dispatches consumed will be restored.
* Characters cannot be simultaneously dispatched to both regular expeditions and "Spectral Secrets" event expeditions.
