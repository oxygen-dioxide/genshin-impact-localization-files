{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Capulin:''' Hey there, friend! Would you like to try my marvelous, revitalizing, energizing tonic? The recipe's a secret! It'll give you the strength to best ten opponents without breaking a sweat. I guarantee you'll be coming back for more!
:{{DIcon}} What are you selling?
::'''Capulin:''' Hehe, healthy miracle tonic of course! Now, my friend, you're clearly someone with a radiant glow, but what if I told you I could make you shine ever brighter?
::'''Capulin:''' This isn't just any old fruit juice, it's the confluence of ancient medicinal wisdom with modern creative techniques. It's the real deal, that I can guarantee &mdash; a hundred and ten percent!
::'''Capulin:''' Only the finest ingredients and most skilled labor went into composing this concoction. In fact, I guarantee that after drinking my healthy tonic, you'll run faster than a [[Weasel Thief|weasel thief]], jump higher than a [[Forest Boar|forest boar]], and train harder than you've ever trained before!
::'''Capulin:''' So what do you say? Would you like to try a bottle?
::{{DIcon}} Can forest boars even jump?
:::'''Capulin:''' Haha, well then, how does jumping higher than a [[Qucusaurus]] sound? Wait, Qucusaurs don't jump either, do they? How about a [[Squirrel|squirrel]]... Higher than a squirrel!
:::'''Capulin:''' Either way, it's the real deal, the real deal I say! Just try it yourself &mdash; there's nothing more convincing than lived experience!
::{{DIcon}} On closer inspection... isn't it just a nutritional supplement?
:::'''Capulin:''' Well, there are nutritional supplements and then there are "nutritional supplements." I, the respectable, respected Capulin, rely on my reputation to do business. If my supplement wasn't the best around, would I be able to stand here every day and praise it so?
:::'''Capulin:''' Just look at these loyal customers, each one a living, breathing endorsement! We don't cheat people around here! If you buy my tonic and aren't satisfied, why, I'll dismantle my stand tomorrow!
:{{DIcon}} No thanks.
::'''Capulin:''' That's quite alright. I'll be here come rain or shine, so you know where to find me if you change your mind!
