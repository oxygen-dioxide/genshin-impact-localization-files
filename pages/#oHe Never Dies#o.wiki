|enemy = He Never Dies

|name_1      = Melee
|desc_1      = Strikes once with its head, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.

|name_2      = Ram
|desc_2      = Dashes forward, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. "He Never Dies" may perform this attack after charging towards a far-away target or twice in a row while close.

|desc_3      = Enters a charging state that lasts for '''8''' seconds. While charging, the amount of [[Poise Damage]] dealt to it will be tallied and its RES will increase by '''300%'''. Poise Damage dealt by [[Blunt Attack]]s are multiplied by '''5''' when tallied, but a single attack cannot add more than '''800''' points to the tally. Once the tally reaches '''2500''', the charging will be interrupted and "He Never Dies" will be paralyzed for a period of time. If the charging completes successfully, "He Never Dies" will dash three times in succession, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} in its path with each dash.
