==Trivia==
* Despite the fact that the species is a "goose", the appearance looks more based on a {{W|swan}}.
** The design was also based on a real-life bird called the {{W|mute swan}}.
* The design and the description of the Snow-Winged Goose has hints of the famous ''{{W|Swan Lake}}'' ballet.
** The crown-like "accesory" in its head is reminiscent to the white swan's headdress.
** When the Snow-Winged Goose and the [[Darkwing Goose]] was spotted together, this was possibly made as a reference to the main swan characters from the ballet itself, Odette and Odile, who represents good and evil due to their main colors.
