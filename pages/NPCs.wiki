==Notable NPCs==
{{Transclude|Characters/Notable|Notable Characters}}

==Trivia==
* When the "Crowd Density" [[Settings#Graphics|graphics setting]] is "High," background NPCs will appear in some locations. These NPCs have no names displayed over their head and cannot be interacted with.
===Voice Actors===
<!--Keith Silverstein not included because he has not confirmed any specific NPC roles-->
* A number of NPCs share their English voice actors with playable characters:
** Anne Yatco ([[Raiden Shogun]]) voiced [[Hiiragi Chisato]], [[Kaede]], [[Mahiru]], [[Matsuzaka]], [[Shouta]], and [[Yayoi Nanatsuki]].
** Christian Banas ([[Thoma]]) voiced [[Ben]], [[Bro Huang]], [[Crafty]], [[Huaqing]], [[Tiancheng]], and [[Yang]].

===Behavior===
* Most [[talent]]s performed near NPCs cause them to flinch. (The "landing" location of talents and their damage do not matter; what matters is how close the active character is to an NPC when using a talent.) However, there are certain Talents that cause NPCs to clap. Below is list of all talents that trigger clapping:<!-- updated through Version 2.5/Yae Miko -->
** Amber: [[Explosive Puppet]]
** Barbara: [[Whisper of Water]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Let the Show Begin‚ô™]], [[Shining Miracle‚ô™]]
** Bennett: [[Fantastic Voyage]]
** Diona: [[Icy Paws]]
** Fischl: [[Nightrider]], [[Midnight Phantasmagoria]]
** Gorou: [[Inuzaka All-Round Defense]]
** Jean: [[Dandelion Breeze]]
** Kamisato Ayaka: [[Kamisato Art: Senho]]
** Klee: [[Jumpy Dumpty]]
** Mona: [[Ripple of Fate]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Mirror Reflection of Doom]], [[Stellaris Phantasm]], [[Illusory Torrent]]
** Ningguang: [[Jade Screen]]
** Sangonomiya Kokomi: [[The Shape of Water]] (Normal and Charged Attacks only), [[Kurage's Oath]], [[Nereid's Ascension]]
** Xiangling: [[Guoba Attack]]
** Xingqiu: [[Guhua Sword: Raincutter]]
** Yoimiya: [[Niwabi Fire-Dance]], [[Ryuukin Saxifrage]]
* If a player blocks the path of a walking NPC for a certain amount of time (e.g. using constructs generated by Elemental Skills), they will disappear to spawn somewhere else to continue their walking route.
* Some NPCs such as [[Marla]] and [[Glory]] are seated on benches at their overworld locations. Players can manipulate how they spawn:
** If the one seat on the bench the NPC usually sits on is occupied, they will spawn on another available seat.
** If all seats of the bench are occupied, the NPC will spawn in front of the bench, standing. Once a seat becomes vacant, they will sit down on that spot.
