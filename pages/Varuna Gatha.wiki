==Summary==
While walking around the [[Yasna Monument]], the Traveler and Paimon spot an Aranara being attacked by [[fungus|fungi]]. They rescue the Aranara, who introduces itself as [[Arapandu]]. Arapandu brings them to [[Apam Woods]], where Paimon notes that the air is extremely off. Arapandu explains that it is a result of the [[Varuna Contraption]] not being maintained since the original creators were long deceased and the Nara Varuna was nowhere to be seen, as they had fixed the device when it went wrong.

After clearing out some fungi that were getting stronger from the abnormal rain, Arapandu brings them to a "rest" stop and guides them to a maintenance area consisting of branches and leaves which were improperly positioned. After positioning them correctly, the device starts to function properly, although there are three more scattered in the area and Arapandu tasks them with helping out its kin, [[Aranakula]], [[Arabalika]] and [[Arakunti]].

The Traveler finds the three and assists them in fixing the Varuna Contraption, allowing them to enter the main component, where they find a [[Winged Dendroshroom]] responsible for the damage. After chasing it around the lair, they finally kill it, restoring the contraption. Arapandu teaches them the music to use the contraption before the four head to Vanarana to partake in the festival.
