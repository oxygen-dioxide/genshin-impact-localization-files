==Description==
To cleanse by fire all that is impure, to allow the impurities to rise with the flames unto the all-accommodating [[Celestia|high heavens]].<br>
These rites would see fresh cinder lit during the rainy seasons, and wolf smoke would arise from those fires as prayers for blessings and the defeat of evil.

These blazing rituals were especially commonplace during that [[Archon War|ancient period of strife]].<br>
For the dreams and delusions of the silent corpses of [[gods]] would produce evil miasmas,<br>
Snatching away the citizens who were no longer theirs, and those who never were theirs also.

Then, a merciful doctor heard a whisper from within the flame as fierce as the red sunset,<br>
From within the crackling and snapping of withered grass.<br>
"Only an unbound flame can purify the filth of this world."<br>
"Lift up this scarlet firewood. With it, you shall repel every demon."

So the doctor took up that devilishly red staff, igniting all that was impure.<br>
Those who have passed, unable to bear deep sadness, but who have since become shrouded by ill karma and calamity,<br>
They shall be reduced to ashen butterflies in this flame, and receive relief from their misfortunes and hurts.<br>
As for the doctor who lit those countless flames, legend has it that they, too, were reduced to smoke in the shape of a [[Eight Adepts|lovely butterfly]].

Though these rites have been forgotten over time and with the coming of peace,<br>
Those with fire in their hearts can still hear these whispered words from flickering flames when they find themselves faced with an imposing darkness:<br>
"Only an unbound flame can purify this world."

==Trivia==
*This is likely the staff used by the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]] to purify the infected bodies during a plague that started spreading in Liyue, after the negative karma of the [[Yaksha]]s killed many people.
* The event [[Springtime Charms]] definitively stated and showed [[Hu Tao]] as the current owner of the Staff of Homa, having been passed down to her through the [[Hu Family]].
** In lore, the staff is not simply used as a regular weapon, but as a ceremonial tool of the Wangsheng arts. Hu Tao's best friend, [[Xiangling]], was not familiar with it, nor did she know much about it beyond what Hu Tao had told her.
*Hu Tao is seen wielding this polearm in her [https://youtu.be/qrH9vMZBwAk official Character Demo], in [https://youtu.be/2dcaQiLBqEo Collected Miscellany - "Hu Tao: Fragrance in Thaw" | Genshin Impact], in the one-time domain {{LL|Enter the "border"|,}} and her first trial [[Test Run - Character Trial Event|Test Run]]. 
*[[Zhongli]] also temporarily wielded this polearm in the one-time story domains [[Of Mysteries and Salt]], [[Beneath the Ancient Tree]], and his second trial run, before it was later switched back to [[Vortex Vanquisher]].
===Etymology===
*In real life, {{w|Homa (ritual)|Homa}} is a Hindu ritual that involves offering things to a fire.
*The name Homa, and especially the wing motif on the top of the staff may also reference the {{w|Homa (mythology)|Homa bird}} from Persian mythology, a legendary vulture or phoenix-like bird associated with the cycle of life and death.<ref>https://www.eavartravel.com/blog/2023/9/11/130706/huma-bird/</ref>
