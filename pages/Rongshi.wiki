'''Rongshi'''{{Lang|zh=戎世|zh_rm=Róngshì}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in [[Teyvat]] storyline [[Archon Quests]], Chapter II, Prologue: [[Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves]].

==Profile==
Rongshi partook in the Crux Clash, but only in the hopes of finding a worthy opponent to battle. He is the [[Traveler]]'s opponent in the semi-finals of [[The Crux Clash]]. Despite outmatching them in sheer strength, he is ultimately bested by the Traveler's quick thinking. Rongshi concedes, happy to have found a worthy opponent and wishes to challenge them sometime again in the future.

===Appearance===
''(To be added.)''

==Gameplay==
The player fights Rongshi during the Clash with the Traveler as the sole party member (and without Elemental Skill/Burst). Rongshi has the same moveset as the [[Treasure Hoarders: Pugilist]].
