|text      = I pulled another all-nighter... But this time, it wasn't for finishing any articles. I stayed up only to greet the morning star, because... the improved version of the celestial globe I've been looking forward to for so long is finally being released today, on my birthday!

So, I'm planning to pick it up from the store early in the day. For one thing, it's safer for me to handle such a delicate instrument personally. For another, the [[Mora]] saved on shipping, combined with my previous paychecks, can go towards the deposit for a new astrolabe... And there happens to be enough left to treat you, my dear friend, to a meal.

Although I can't predict your future or reveal your fate, the Great Astrologist is here to cheer you on, and this meal will be a testament to that.

Don't worry, I've saved up my payments for a while now, so there's gonna be more than just a salad! Please do come!
