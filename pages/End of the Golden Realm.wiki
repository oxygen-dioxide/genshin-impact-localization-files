'''End of the Golden Realm''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Desert Pavilion Chronicle]].

==Description==
Young wanderers, please heed [[Old Blind Poet|this man]] so old and blind.<br>
Heed the ruins of [[Gurabad]], heed the culmination of a delusional dream...<br>
Heed the jewel that shines like a dome of stars, and heed the riven states.

Towering spires and golden temples were swallowed by a raging tide, and the halls and palaces became the abodes of the ragged poor...<br>
The infuriated mob followed the will of [[Shiruyeh|one wearing a brass mask]], while those with wisdom proclaimed this happening the "great plague."<br>
Gurabad fell to this black plague, and [[King Deshret|Lord of the Red Sands]] fell upon the path of self-destruction...<br>
[[Liloupar]], born to lilies, found herself repaid with a split soul after falling victim to a plot most insidious,<br>
While the vast and fertile kingdoms collapsed into the sands overnight. Tribes and kingdoms began the tumult anew...<br>
From there, the people of the desert oases divided themselves into seven states, with the city of sapphires, [[Tulaytullah]], being one of the greatest.

"I think I have lived long enough to bear witness to more than my fair share of short-lived fools and villains..."<br>
"When I was young, the gilded walls once shrouded the sapphire domes like waves covering the moon."<br>
"In the days of my youth, the canals of Tulaytullah shone like a luminous lattice, their lights dueling the moon for dominance."<br>
"Now, I have been stripped of sight, and yet I must witness [[Xiphos|nobles]] falling to slavery, [[Faramarz|princes]] cast down by slave-soldiers..."<br>
"Now, I can no longer see, and yet I speak of dignitaries assassinating the wise and [[Makhaira|foreign dancers]] seizing power..."<br>
"Nations live and die as if in a drunken dream. The beloved and vile alike are all crushed under the weight of a mill like wheat husks."

The sapphire sea is wreathed in a fog of lies, which go on to become legends and history&mdash;<br>
A [[Old Blind Poet|general]], once the conqueror of countless cities, was left with but a slave to guide the way,<br>
While a [[Xiphos|young slave]] bore the [[Key of Khaj-Nisut|"key"]] to restoring their homeland...<br>
[[Badanah|The king]] who died absurdly because of a hunting falcon was left with bloodied knife marks along his throat,<br>
And [[Makhaira|the dancer]] who made a vow to the prince cared only for the hatred she felt toward the tyrant...

Mortal hands were molded into the shape of a falcon, and the broken [[Jinni]] was infused within it.<br>
From the cliffs of Gurabad it rose with a cry, sailing past the pitiable desert states...<br>
Finally arriving in the hands of gilded descendants, the lost memories flaking off like sand.<br>
The man-made feather lay upon a dune, silently proclaiming the end of nations...

Through an aged voice, [[Xiphos|the lost prince]] recalled the palace burning in his homeland,<br>
His [[Old Blind Poet|master]] at the time had been a general and a poet, loyal to the [[Badanah|tyrant]] who ruined his nation.<br>
All things will have their rewards and repercussions. One was stripped of sight, the other of their throne...<br>
All the while, the grinding wheel of fate spun onward, scattering broken hopes across the world.
