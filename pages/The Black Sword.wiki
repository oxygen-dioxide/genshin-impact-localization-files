==Description==
A blade that thirsts after fresh blood will be awakened by its scent.<br />
Those who possess, wield and nourish it will keep killing. Till even a pure soul is blackened by bloodshed...

There once was a bright [[Bloodstained Knight|white knight]], who longed ever for the path of justice.<br />
Clad in burnished armor, a mirror-sheen sword hung from his hip.<br />
Wherever there was injustice, man-eating beast, or fire in the distance,<br />
The Knight would ride up in haste to cut, slash, and pierce.<br />
Following the teachings of the [[Rostam|Wolf Pup]], who taught him chivalry, justice and swordsmanship,<br />
He cut, slashed and pierced them from head to toe...<br />
Till justice had run its course, and the monster moved no more.

"I began to lose myself in cutting, slashing and piercing."<br />
"When my blade's edge met my foe's flesh, it sent a tingle up my spine."<br />
"Ah, I thought. That must be the feeling of justice getting its due."<br />
"As long as I cut, slash and pierce the evil in this twisted world,"<br />
"Someday, someday, it shall all be cleansed."

"O, foolish knight, slaughter in the name of justice is slaughter still."<br />
"Nay. Slaughter in the name of justice is justice."

Cut. Slash. Pierce. Thus will you see justice done!<br />
Though the white flowers the maidens offer you should be bloodied black, though your sword should no longer gleam bright,<br />
Though your fair countenance should turn hideous, and you should be forced to don an iron mask,<br />
Though those you defend cannot understand you, cease never!

And so, the black-stained knight persisted on his path, pursuing monsters in the name of justice,<br />
Until he came upon an ancient, ruined realm, where he discovered the ultimate injustice...
