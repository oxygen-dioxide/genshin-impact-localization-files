==Gameplay Notes==
* The healing effect can be triggered even if Normal/Charged Attack fails to deal DMG against an invulnerable or shielded enemy.

==Description==
A blade that thirsts after fresh blood will be awakened by its scent.<br>
Those who possess, wield and nourish it will keep killing. Till even a pure soul is blackened by bloodshed...

There once was a bright [[Bloodstained Knight|white knight]], who longed ever for the path of justice.<br>
Clad in burnished armor, a mirror-sheen sword hung from his hip.<br>
Wherever there was injustice, man-eating beast, or fire in the distance,<br>
The Knight would ride up in haste to cut, slash, and pierce.<br>
Following the teachings of the [[Rostam|Wolf Pup]], who taught him chivalry, justice and swordsmanship,<br>
He cut, slashed and pierced them from head to toe...<br>
Till justice had run its course, and the monster moved no more.

"I began to lose myself in cutting, slashing and piercing."<br>
"When my blade's edge met my foe's flesh, it sent a tingle up my spine."<br>
"Ah, I thought. That must be the feeling of justice getting its due."<br>
"As long as I cut, slash and pierce the evil in this twisted world,"<br>
"Someday, someday, it shall all be cleansed."

"O, foolish knight, slaughter in the name of justice is slaughter still."<br>
"Nay. Slaughter in the name of justice is justice."

Cut. Slash. Pierce. Thus will you see justice done!<br>
Though the [[Maiden's Distant Love|white flowers the maidens]] offer you should be bloodied black, though your sword should no longer gleam bright,<br>
Though your fair countenance should turn hideous, and you should be forced to don an [[Bloodstained Iron Mask|iron mask]],<br>
Though those you defend cannot understand you, cease never!

And so, the black-stained knight persisted on his path, pursuing monsters in the name of justice,<br>
Until he came upon an [[Khaenri'ah|ancient, ruined realm]], where he discovered the [[Hilichurls|ultimate injustice]]...
