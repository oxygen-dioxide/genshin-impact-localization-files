:{{DIcon}} A present?
::'''Lectoure:''' That's right &mdash; I've chosen something special from Fontaine to give to my lady love.
::'''Lectoure:''' Curious, I'd hope? All the other sailors hurried off to the [[Court of Fontaine]] the moment we came ashore. Only I came back here.
::'''Lectoure:''' Sailing is hard work, yeah, but I truly look forward to setting sail once more to see my lady love in [[Natlan]].
::'''Lectoure:''' When it comes to passions, I am nothing if not a serious man. If all goes well, I would even be willing to change lines of work and stay with her.
::'''Lectoure:''' But there are quite a few tribes where she lives, and different tribes come with different rules... Will I be able to integrate smoothly?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
