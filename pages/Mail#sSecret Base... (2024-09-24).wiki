|text      = [[Lyney]] suggested we have a small underwater birthday party, and [[Lynette]] has already gone ahead to buy some underwater decorations. They also asked me to invite my friends to join.

But... it feels much easier to write than to ask in person.

So, can I invite you to my secret underwater base? After a simple birthday celebration, we can relax down there for a while. Imagine being a [[Lumitoile]], stretching your limbs comfortably in the water, silently counting the [[Tidalga]] drifting by, maybe even spotting a passing... Grin-Malkin [[Blubberbeast]]?

I've measured the space beforehand, and if [[Paimon]] and [[Pers]] squeeze a little, there's just enough room left for the four of us to lie down.
