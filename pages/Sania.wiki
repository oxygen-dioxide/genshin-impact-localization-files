==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sania:''' *sigh* This is so frustrating...
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Sania:''' Today, perhaps. Tomorrow? I'm afraid we can't be sure.
::'''Sania:''' With a husband like mine, we're struggling to make ends meet every day.
::'''Sania:''' I mean, I'm not demanding that he earn huge sums or anything, but I'd at least like a steady income.
::'''Sania:''' But apart from cooking, he can't do anything at all.
::'''Sania:''' And everyone here in Aaru Village knows how to cook their own food. It's how we survive here... So who's going to buy food off the street?
::'''Sania:''' And even that would still be acceptable... But not only does he make no attempt to earn Mora, he gives out the food he makes to others! For free!
::{{DIcon}} How about talking it out with him?
::'''Sania:''' I've tried talking, and I've tried scolding.
::'''Sania:''' You know, he even considered leaving the village to look for some work, but then he claimed he'd miss home... or that he was sensitive to the humidity...
::'''Sania:''' In the end, he just can't bear to leave me here alone in the village. And what am I supposed to do about that?
::'''Sania:''' He's a good man. He's so good, he would spend our Mora on helping others.
::'''Sania:''' I'm not saying that helping others is bad, but we need to look out for ourselves first, right?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sania:''' See you. Let me see if I can save some Mora on our expenditures anywhere else...
