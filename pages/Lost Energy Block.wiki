'''Lost Energy Block''' is a Quest Item obtained from [[investigation]] points in [[Ardravi Valley]]. There are a total of '''20''' Lost Energy Blocks obtainable from 17 locations.

Three Lost Energy Blocks are used to reactivate each Damaged Ruin Guard, therefore, only '''15''' are needed to reactivate the five guards. All remaining Lost Energy Blocks will be removed from the player's inventory and world after reactivating the fifth Damaged Ruin Guard.

See [[Cryptic Message in Sumeru]] for the related [[Hidden Exploration Objective]].

==Locations==
Beside each of the Damaged Ruin Guards, there will be one Lost Energy Blocks. The remaining Lost Energy Blocks can be found in Devantaka Mountain, outskirt of Vimara Village, and outskirt of Port Ormos.
