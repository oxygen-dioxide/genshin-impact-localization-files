|name_1      = Mimicry
|desc_1      = The Tenebrous Papilla comes in 3 possible variants. Depending on the variant, it will mimic the forms of different [[Normal Boss]]es and perform their attacks, but it does not obtain any of the special mechanics or attributes that the original bosses have, such as Fury and shields. When the Tenebrous Papilla is defeated, it will become a different variant upon respawning. The possible transformations are:
* '''Type I:''' [[Aeonblight Drake]], [[Jadeplume Terrorshroom]], [[Cryo Regisvine]], [[Electro Regisvine]], [[Pyro Regisvine]]
* '''Type II:''' [[Maguu Kenki]], [[Primo Geovishap]], [[Cryo Hypostasis]], [[Electro Hypostasis]], [[Hydro Hypostasis]]
* '''Type III:''' [["Statue of Marble and Brass"]], [[Millennial Pearl Seahorse]], [[Kongamato]]

|name_2      = Attrition
|desc_2      = Some of the Tenebrous Papilla's attacks inflict stacks of Attrition on hit. The amount of stacks inflicted depends on the attack. For each stack, the active character will lose [[HP]] equal to '''1% Max HP + 50''' after a short delay.<br><br>Aside from Beseech the Dark, attacks that inflict Attrition are indicated by a large [[triquetra]] symbol that appears on the boss when the attacks begin. The same symbol will appear on the active character if they have stacks of Attrition, in addition to a status icon over the character's HP bar.<br><br>Attrition stacks are not tied to the character who is hit, and the HP loss will always occur on the active character.

|name_3      = Beseech the Dark
|desc_3      = After '''40''' seconds have passed or upon reaching '''70%''' of its Max HP (or immediately upon entering combat in the Spiral Abyss), returns to the center of the arena and gains a [[Void Ward]] which grants it immunity to all DMG. The Void Ward has a durability of '''53''' ('''72''' in the Spiral Abyss), which will reduce by '''1''' when hit by an Elemental attack, or '''3''' when hit by a [[Nightsoul]]-aligned attack.<br><br>While the Void Ward is active, enters a charging state for '''13''' seconds where it continuously spawns spikes around the arena, each dealing '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and inflicting '''10''' stacks of Attrition on hit. If charging successfully completes, produces a massive explosion across the arena, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and inflicting '''60''' stacks of Attrition on hit.<br><br>Destroying the Void Ward will interrupt the charging process and paralyze it for a period of time. All [[RES]] is reduced by '''70%''' while paralyzed, and even after recovering from paralysis, its RES will only recover by half the amount lost.
