{{Description|The ancient tree that watches over this snowy plain has grown crimson branches and leaves in response to your offerings. If you listen quietly, you can almost hear its whispers, begging you to satisfy its yearning...}}
The '''Crimson Wish''' is a system in [[Dragonspine]] which allows players to obtain [[Crimson Agate]] by completing periodical quests. It is unlocked once the [[Frostbearing Tree]] has reached Level 8. Every Monday and Friday on the player's server, 5 Crimson Wishes will spawn throughout Dragonspine. Each Crimson Wish will award one Crimson Agate upon completion.

The Wishes can be done in [[Co-Op Mode]], and participants who have unlocked Crimson Wish in their own world and aid in the quest will also earn a Crimson Agate.

Once the Frostbearing Tree has reached Level 12, Crimson Wishes will no longer be available. However excess Crimson Agates will be retained.
