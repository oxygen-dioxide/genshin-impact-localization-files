==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Darya:''' Isn't the continued growth of the Akademiya dependent on the education of future scholars?
:'''Darya:''' If we wait until there are no successors left, it will be too late already. We can't actually bring in researchers from the [[Nagarjunites]], right?
:{{DIcon}} You mean...
::'''Darya:''' The Akademiya recently cut back on the budget for education, and that rubbed me the wrong way.
::'''Darya:''' To better advance research and development, the Akademiya would recruit talented children at an early age.
::'''Darya:''' I'm the teacher for those children. Seeing them mature into accomplished researchers gives me immense pride.
::'''Darya:''' But if the Akademiya keeps shaving the budget, it will impact their education.
::'''Darya:''' Even from the point of maintaining our prestige, I still don't think it's right.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Did you come up with any solution?
:::'''Darya:''' I will have to speak out if the Akademiya continues to cut funding.
:::'''Darya:''' I've talked to [[Vikram]]. He also believes it's what has to be done to ensure the learning conditions for the children.
::;(Obtain [[Guide to Admonition]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} The Nagarjunites?
::'''Darya:''' The Nagarjunites were a branch of the Akademiya from long ago.
::'''Darya:''' They were said to advocate strange ideals like "the transmission of knowledge at all costs" and "conflict is the natural order of Teyvat."
::'''Darya:''' In short, this school of thought has long broken away from the rest of the Akademiya. They're no longer on the same branch.
::'''Darya:''' Although they still seem to exist deep in the desert, most people have either never heard of them, or have, but consider them a myth.
::'''Darya:''' I'm just being angry, so don't take it too seriously. I believe that sooner or later the Akademiya will take the future of our children seriously...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Darya:''' Farewell. Someone has to speak out about this.
