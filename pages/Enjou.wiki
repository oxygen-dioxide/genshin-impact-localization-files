'''Enjou''' {{Lang|ja=淵上}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] in [[Inazuma]], first appearing on the second floor of the library in [[The Narrows]] as '''???'''.

He serves as the driver of the [[From Dusk to Dawn in Byakuyakoku]] World Quest, being the Traveler's translator and sole clerical staff for the duration of Enkanomiya's trial. He is later revealed to be a [[Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames|Pyro-aligned Abyss Lector]] in search of the book "[[Before Sun and Moon]]" in order to prove that gods and [[Celestia]] were from beyond [[Teyvat]].

==Profile==
Enjou claims to be a researcher whose duty is to organize and translate clues regarding Enkanomiya's trial to obtain the [[Bloodbranch Coral]]. Throughout the duration of the trial, Enjou helps the Traveler in a multitude of different ways, such as informing them of the [[Golden Bridle]]'s location and breaking the seal that would otherwise render [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] unenterable.

After the Traveler defeats the three [[Primordial Bathysmal Vishap|Bathysmal Vishaps]] under the Dainichi Mikoshi, Enjou reveals that he is a colluding member of the Abyss Order and transforms to his [[Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames|original form]]. He is ultimately bested and casually suggests that [[Paimon]] might betray them before teleporting to the Abyss.

Enjou later returned to Enkanomiya and restored the three Towers of the Void with Abyssal technology, causing the darkness to encroach the land and harming everything that wasn't related to the Abyss. [[Tsumi]] tasked the Traveler, who had been sent by [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] after the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]] only halted the bleached soil instead of reversing it. After restoring the towers to emit light energy, he began to absorb the darkness. The Traveler confronted him in the library, where he revealed that Tsumi was one of the vishap-people and that he had made an alliance with them after promising to engulf Enkanomiya in darkness in to save their captive kin in return for the Abyss Order having safe passage. However, the vishaps did not know that the void energies were poisonous to them and thus believed he had betrayed them, although he claimed that it would have been pointless if they were subjected to the powers of the Abyss but remained unaffected. He told them how to restore the light before the vishaps could cut off the Bloodbranch Coral, which would doom Watatsumi Island and gave them part of a pendant that he had found while inside the Dainichi Mikoshi before teleporting back to the Abyss.

===Personality===
Enjou is an easygoing and friendly being who shows uncanny proficiency in the millennia-old [[Enkanomiya|Byakuyakoku]] language. Despite his identity as an Abyss Lector, he seems to be very expressive and forthcoming with his emotions. Even when his true form is revealed Enjou keeps his casual demeanor, conversing in a friendly manner. He admits that although he had numerous reasons to kill the Traveler, he chooses not to because he likes them.

===Appearance===
Enjou has blue hair that reaches his chin and wears a pair of spectacles. He sports a kimono laced in red and a black waistband. As for footwear, he uses a pair of white tabi socks and zori with light brown straps.

His Abyss Lector form remains the same as any other Lector.

==Trivia==
* The kanji for Enjou's name, 淵上, does indeed mean "above the depth" as he explained to the Traveler during his first meeting. However, his name is also a homophone of {{Lang|ja=炎上|ja_tl=flaming}}, hinting at his true identity.
** His kanji can be also read as Fuchigami (or Fuchikami) by using the native reading, in which case it represents a Japanese surname. It may show his attempt to pretend to be an Inazuman.
* Enjou's true identity is hinted several times in-game:
** When dispelling the seal enclosing the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], he tells them to stay back in case something bad happened, such as getting "cursed and turn into some sort of flame-flinging monster".
** After dispelling the seal, he then remarks about a "kind of rush you get from burning a huge library"; it is not known if this was a library either in [[Sumeru]] or if he was referring to the events of the "Great Fire of Fall Equinox", the latter being the largest library in northern Teyvat prior to its burning.
