'''Enjou''', also known as '''The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou,"''' '''Sanka''', '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka,"''' and '''Kokuchuu''', is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]].

He is first encountered in [[Enkanomiya]] in the {{Quest|From Dusk to Dawn in Byakuyakoku}}, where he calls himself Enjou. He later appears in [[Natlan]] in {{Quest|Yupanqui's Turnfire}}, where he provides a new alias, Sanka; then again in the {{Quest|Vision of Ashen Desolation}}, this time calling himself Kokuchuu.

He is the Traveler's translator and sole clerical staff for the duration of Enkanomiya's trial, but later reveals himself to be a [[Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames|Pyro-aligned Abyss Lector]]. While in Natlan, he is attempting to search for the [[Mare Jivari]].

==Profile==
Enjou is a "lowly clerk" working in the [[Abyss Order]], primarily focusing on discovering ancient lore. He is not part of the Order's inner circle, though he is aware of their activities. Instead, he is an enigmatic, eccentric individual who has an uncanny habit of running away from bad situations. Despite his Abyssal nature, Enjou is surprisingly amicable with the people of Teyvat.

===History===
The Traveler first discovers him in [[Enkanomiya]], where he claims to have been sent by [[Tsuyuko]] to help the Traveler obtain the [[Bloodbranch Coral]]. Throughout the duration of the trial, Enjou helps the Traveler in a multitude of different ways, such as informing them of the [[Golden Bridle]]'s location and breaking the seal that would otherwise render [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] unenterable. 

After the Traveler defeats the three [[Primordial Bathysmal Vishap|Bathysmal Vishaps]] under the Dainichi Mikoshi, Enjou reveals that he is a colluding member of the Abyss Order and transforms to his original form. He is ultimately bested and reveals that he was searching for the book ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'' in order to prove that the [[god]]s and [[Celestia]] were from beyond [[Teyvat]]. As he could not find it, he believed the Traveler to have had it in their possession and thus decided to kill them to check. Despite the Traveler's interruption of his operation, he chooses to overlook it due to having grown to like them. Before he leaves, he casually remarks that [[Paimon]] could betray them.

During [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]] event, Enjou returned to Enkanomiya and restored the three Towers of the Void with Abyssal technology, causing the darkness to encroach the land and harming everything that wasn't related to the Abyss. The Traveler, who had been sent by [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]], agrees to work with [[Tsumi]] to help with their investigation after the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]] only halted the bleached [[Watatsumi Island#Holy Soil|Holy Soil]] instead of reversing it. 

After restoring the Towers of the Void to emit energy from the Light Realm, Tsumi sensed that a faint vortex is still continuously absorbing the darkness inside the Dainichi Mikoshi and believes it is triggered by Enjou's need for Abyssal energy. She reveals Enjou's location and the Traveler confronted him, where he revealed that Tsumi was one of the vishap-people and she was using the Traveler to get her revenge on him. He formed an alliance with the vishaps after promising to plunge Enkanomiya into darkness so that the vishaps could rescue their captive kin in the Dainichi Mikoshi, in return for them allowing Abyss Order safe passage through the vishap's territory. However, the vishaps did not know that the void energies were poisonous to them and thus believed he had betrayed them, although he claimed that it would have been pointless if they were subjected to the powers of the Abyss but remained unaffected. He told the Traveler how to restore the light before the vishaps could cut off the Bloodbranch Coral source, which would doom Watatsumi Island and gave them part of a [[Fragmented Accessory (Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath)|pendant]] that he had found while inside the Dainichi Mikoshi before teleporting back to the Abyss.

Enjou later traveled to [[Natlan]]. He spoke with two children, [[Huni]] and [[Toba]], asking about the "[[Turnfire]]," a mythical fire that was said to be found in the [[Night Kingdom]], and feigned promise to help them look for their [[Yumkasaur Whelp]]s after their mother, [[Nanna]], had seemingly committed suicide by leaping headfirst off a cliff when she was tainted by abyssal energy. In reality, the said Yumkasaur ended up crashing on Enjou's head, and he became intrigued by bungee jumping, befriending the Yumkasaur and tending to her wounds. Learning that the latest successor of the Turnfire name was [[Kinich]], he attempted to ask another story about him, but spotted the Traveler and Paimon walking up the cliff towards their location. Enjou gave the children the alias "Sanka" and told them that the next two people coming up were friends of his that would help them with their problem. When the two expressed doubt, Enjou teleported away while they were distracted.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Mysterious Visitor From Huitztlan}}</ref>

Later, he would spy on Kinich and [[Ajaw]], though they were aware of his presence and eventually confronted him in a hidden cave. Enjou was interested in the lore of behind the [[Scions of the Canopy]] and stated that he allowed Kinich to catch up to him, as he didn't feel like running and was tired of spying on them. Instead, he offered to negotiate a comfortable operating distance that would work for both parties. To his surprise, Kinich knew that he had other motives and told him to tell him before he would negotiate a price.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Hero's Rite}}</ref>

Per a deal made with the two, he would summon a [[Beastly Rift]] in return for conducting uninterrupted "historical research" while Ajaw would also ask him to claim Kinich's body after learning from him the fate of all Turnfire name bearers. After finishing up his part of the deal, Enjou came to uphold Ajaw's end of the bargain, but was surprised to see the Traveler and Paimon with Kinich. After Paimon thought he was responsible for tainting [[Kongamato]], Enjou reminded her that he was not part of the inner circle while Kinich confirmed that he was only a passerby. Enjou later made his leave and returned to Nanna, discovering that her wounds had fully healed and that she missed her family. He then returned to Huni and Toba, apologizing to them for his deceit and bringing Nanna as a surprise for Huni.

From what Kinich could discern in his deal with Enjou, the Lector was looking into the history behind [[Mare Jivari]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Last Turnfire Night}}</ref>

After the Abyss invasion of Natlan, Enjou traveled to the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], taking on the name "Kokuchuu" and met a man named [[Leyla]]. He subjected him to "hypersensitivity training" that resulted in Leyla entering a deep trance. [[Citlali]], [[Ororon]] and the Traveler would help break him out of the trance. Citlali tried to trap Enjou so they could question him, but he was able to avoid it and escaped.

===Appearance===
Enjou has blue hair that reaches his chin and wears a pair of spectacles. He sports a kimono laced in red and a black waistband. As for footwear, he uses a pair of white tabi socks and zori with light brown straps.

His Abyss Lector form remains the same as any other Lector.

{{Quests and Events|Enjou}}

==Trivia==
* The kanji for Enjou's name, {{ja|淵上}}, does indeed mean "above the depth" as he explained to the Traveler during his first meeting. However, his name is also a homophone of {{Lang|ja=炎上|ja_tl=flaming}}, hinting at his true identity.
** His kanji can be also read as ''Fuchigami'' (or ''Fuchikami'') by using the native reading, in which case it represents a Japanese surname. It may show his attempt to pretend to be an Inazuman.
* Enjou's true identity is hinted several times in-game:
** When dispelling the seal enclosing the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], he tells them to stay back in case something bad happened, such as getting "cursed and turn into some sort of flame-flinging monster".
** After dispelling the seal, he then remarks about a "kind of rush you get from burning a huge library"; it is not known if this was a library either in [[Sumeru]] or if he was referring to the events of the "Great Fire of Fall Equinox", the latter being the largest library in northern Teyvat prior to its burning.
