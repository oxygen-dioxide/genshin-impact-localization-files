{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Andrius

|desc_1 = During this phase, the edge of the arena will be covered by an icy floor that deals '''16.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DoT}} if stood in.
Andrius runs in a circle around the map, and will '''Wolf Charge''' towards the player(s) when he stops (twice). Next, he circles the arena once again, then '''Wolf Leaps''' to the middle of the arena, either continuing Phase 1 or entering Phase 2 if certain triggers are met.
* Trigger 1: When his HP falls below '''55%'''
* Trigger 2: The player(s) take too long to defeat him.

==Boss Description==
{{Description|Rumor has it that a great eternal power rests at [[Wolvendom]], watching over the wolves...|[[Adventurer Handbook]], before unlocking Wolf of the North Challenge}}
{{Description|A noble soul that watches over Wolvendom. When the safety of the wolves is threatened, it will take the form of a wolf and show its fangs and claws. It is said that its powers were given to it by an ancient [[god]].|Adventurer Handbook, after unlocking Wolf of the North Challenge}}
{{Description|The noblest and greatest of souls, who watches over the lupical of Wolvendom.<br>When the wolfpack is imperiled, it will emerge in the form of a wolf and show forth its fangs and claws.<br><br>''The wolves of Wolvendom are frightening phantoms to the people of [[Mondstadt]]:<br>A blurred shape flashing through the forest, a chilling howl in the indeterminate distance, the creeping sense of eyes constantly nailed on their backs...<br>Humans rarely have the opportunity to lock their eyes with a wolf, for this is the law [[Lupus Boreas]] laid down for its race.''|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* This challenge is the only Weekly Boss encounter that is not a Trounce Domain. Because of this:
** The encounter itself is similar to that of Normal Bosses in that Andrius' strength scales on the player's current [[Adventure Rank|World Level]]. They can also leave the arena to cause him to despawn by running far enough or teleporting to a distant [[waypoint]].
** This challenge is the only Weekly Boss encounter where the player can swap parties after defeating Andrius before obtaining the rewards for the [[Companionship EXP]] and [[Character EXP]].
** The player cannot directly teleport to the boss and have to make their way there on foot.
* Andrius is the only enemy to be immune to two different elements.
* The first time this domain is challenged in [[Razor]]'s Story Quest, the Wolf is identified as "Boreas." After this, it is referred to as "Andrius."
* In the {{Quest|We Will Be Reunited}}, it is confirmed by [[Dainsleif]] that the physical body of Andrius died long ago; the boss in this challenge is his spirit instead.
* During the {{Quest|Dishonorable Trial}}, The Wolf of The North challenge is unavailable.
* The Wolf of the North Challenge is the only Weekly Boss to not drop [[Character Ascension Materials#Ascension Gems|gem-type ascension materials]] for an element used in the fight; in this case, it does not drop [[Vayuda Turquoise]] gemstones even though the boss uses [[Anemo]]. This is likely because the Wolf of the North Challenge covers the gemstones of the elements not covered by the [[Confront Stormterror]] domain, the other Weekly Boss introduced in Version 1.0.
* It is possible to put the meteorite from [[Starfell Sword]] or a Stone Stele from [[Dominus Lapidis]] below Andrius to evade his Spinning Slash attack, but this may cause Andrius to behave erratically due to his AI being unable to decide what to do next.
* Prior to [[Version 1.2]],{{verify}} it was possible to petrify Andrius using Zhongli's [[Planet Befall]] (as demonstrated [https://youtu.be/x2fSfC6-w84 here]) if Zhongli is a higher level than Andrius.
* Prior to Version 1.2,{{verify}} it was possible to force Andrius to exit the arena without despawning (as demonstrated [https://youtu.be/pd0oNFZFq_4&ab_channel=neilleexxi here]). This required at least 2 players in [[Co-Op Mode]] with the host summoning the boss while another player stood on a nearby tree. Due to his AI, he would change target and keep [[Aggro|aggression]] on the player on the tree, as long as the host did not attack and leave the arena. This caused Andrius to behave erratically due to being stuck outside the arena.
