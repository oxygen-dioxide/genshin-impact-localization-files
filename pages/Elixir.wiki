'''Elixirs''' are metal pills of varying quality used to [[Weapon Ascension Materials|ascend]] [[Weapons]].

The [[Adepti]] developed elixirs using their particular version of [[Alchemy]], ''Dan-ding'',<ref name="Danding" group="Note">The Chinese description of [[Mist Veiled Lead Elixir]] and [[Mist Veiled Mercury Elixir]]. Localized into English as "Alchemy" and "the manufacture of elixirs," respectively.</ref> as items that can give special powers to weapons.<ref name="Gold Elixir">{{Ref/Item|Mist Veiled Gold Elixir}}</ref> Apparently some people have misunderstood their purpose and tried eating them, dying as a result.<ref name="Mercury Elixir">{{Ref/Item|Mist Veiled Mercury Elixir}}</ref>

==Lore==
[[Jueyun Karst]], the realm of the adepti, contains three other secrets aside from the ability to control the elements of the world. The first is Fulu (Sigils), which the adepti use to store their power in the form of symbols. The second is Waijing ([[Sub-Space Creation]]) which the adepti use to fashion a cosmic paradise with their minds.<ref name="Lead Elixir">{{Ref/Item|Mist Veiled Lead Elixir}}</ref> The third is {{Lang|''Dan-ding''|zh=丹鼎之术|zh_rm=Dāndǐng zhī Shù|zh_lit=The Art of the Elixir {{w|Ding (vessel)|Cauldron}}}},<ref name="Danding" group="Note" /> a form of [[Alchemy]] which the adepti use to manufacture elixirs.<ref name="Mercury Elixir"/> Elixirs are pills that cause certain death to those who swallow them, but this is because the adepti made them out of metal for the purpose of infusing weapons with special powers. Elixirs are rarely seen in the world because martial artists pride themselves on the ways of combat rather than looking into the ways of the adepti.<ref name="Gold Elixir"/>

==Trivia==
* {{Lang|{{w|Fulu}}|zh=符箓|zh_rm=fúlù}} is a term for Daoist incantations and magic symbols, written or painted as talisman or {{Lang|''lingfu''|zh=灵符|zh_rm=língfú}}, similar to what can be found on Qiqi's head or the [[Sigil of Permission]]. It is unlikely a reference to the [[Elemental Sigils]] collected in-game.
