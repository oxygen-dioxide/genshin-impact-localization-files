{{Dialogue start}}
;(Listen to Kokomi's speech)
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It looks like everything's in place for the feast. But I still need to give a quick speech before the festivities begin.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... How much energy will that take? {{not a typo|D'you}} think you've got enough?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't worry, I've got plenty. Thanks to you two, I recovered more quickly than usual.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's great! We'll be rooting for you!
:'''''Kokomi walks by the banquet fire and starts to give a speech.'''''
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Welcome everyone. Today is the day that we celebrate our victory.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Recently, our war with the Shogun's Army came to an end, and we finally saw the abolition of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]].
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' None of us can know what the [[Inazuma]] of the future will look like. But tomorrow, I meet with the Tenryou Commission for peace talks. I give you my word that I will strive for peace for [[Watatsumi Island]], once and for all.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Thank you all for your valiant efforts throughout. Truly, it is only through those efforts that we have been able to prevail in this trying war.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' This feast is held in honor of each and every one of you gathered here today. I hope all of you get to relax and enjoy our hard-won victory.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 people 01.ogg}} '''Watatsumi Islanders:''' Woohoo!!!
:'''''After a while...'''''
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Tonight seems to have gone off without a hitch. I'm so glad it's all going smoothly.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' People tend to be more open when they're in a good mood. Could I ask you to go around and see what information you can gather, (Traveler)?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I still have no further leads regarding the issue of potential collusion between the [[Tenryou Commission]] and the [[Fatui]].
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' And I'm concerned that something might happen at tomorrow's peace talks...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, sure. We'll go ask around.
----
{{Quest Description|update|Kokomi believes that the relaxed atmosphere will increase peoples' tendency to confide their feelings. Time to investigate the rumors while the Victory Feast is still ongoing.}}
;(Talk to [[Arisawa]])
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 arisawa 01.ogg}} '''Arisawa:''' A friend of mine was really looking forward to this feast. Even promised he'd sing a song with me. *sigh* If only he were still here...

;(Talk to [[Iwata]])
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 iwata 01.ogg}} '''Iwata:''' I do hope the future will be free from the trials and tribulations of the past. If every day can be as happy as today, that would be a blessing.

;(Talk to Kokomi)
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Found anything out yet?

;(Talk to [[Matsuda]])
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 matsuda 01.ogg}} '''Matsuda:''' With me around, no one would dare try any funny business at the Victory Feast!

;(Talk to [[Ryouko (Rumors Abound)|Ryouko]])
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 ryouko 01.ogg}} '''Ryouko:''' Come visit Watatsumi Island whenever you want. You'll always be a hero here!

;(Talk to [[Youkou]])
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 youkou 01.ogg}} '''Youkou:''' Her Excellency is looking much better today, I can breathe a sigh of relief... Nothing is more important than everyone being safe and sound.

;(Talk to [[Kouzen]])
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 kouzen 01.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' I'm not drunk... Another one's not gonna do me any harm! Haha!
----
;(Talk to [[Hirai]])
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 hirai 01.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' Watatsumi Island is finally at peace, and it's all thanks to Her Excellency, Sangonomiya...
:{{DIcon}} What's new? Anything to report?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 hirai 02.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' Recently? Um, lemme think...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 hirai 03.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' Well, the biggest thing for us is that we can finally get back out on the ocean to fish.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 hirai 04.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' During the hostilities, the open sea was full of warships. We just had to make do with what little fish and shrimp we could get our hands on closer to shore.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 hirai 05.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' When the catch wasn't good, we'd all go hungry. The poor kids were crying all day and night, but there was just nothing I could do.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 hirai 06.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' We'd go to bed ravenous and be tossing and turning all night long, trying to keep it together until the morning. At least things are finally improving now...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 hirai 07.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' I hear you're Captain of Swordfish II, is that right? Well, thank you for your service. Here, have a fish! It's freshly caught, so it's a bit, uh, fishy, but it's fine.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... no, no, no, w&mdash;we couldn't possibly...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 hirai 08.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' Ah, come on, take it! Without you, we'd probably still be going to bed hungry tonight. Her Excellency always teaches us to repay kindness with gratitude.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, well, thanks. Come on, (Traveler) let's go talk to some others.

;(Talk to Hirai again)
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 hirai 01.ogg}} '''Hirai:''' Let's hope the peace talks go smoothly. The last thing we want is to go back to war...
----
;(Talk to [[Kabasawa]])
:{{A|vo xhlq004 3 kabasawa 01.ogg}} '''Kabasawa:''' Hey there, care for some fresh fruit and vegetables? Nature's remedy when you overdo the barbecue!
:{{DIcon}} What's new? Anything to report?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 3 kabasawa 02.ogg}} '''Kabasawa:''' Are you referring to the thing about the Tenryou Commission and the Fatui? I've heard rumors, but nothing too detailed.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 3 kabasawa 03.ogg}} '''Kabasawa:''' It's funny you should say that the soldiers seem excitable, though. I've had the same feeling. See that guy over there?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 3 kabasawa 04.ogg}} '''Kabasawa:''' He's been acting strange these days &mdash; always shouting and waving his spear around when he's got nothing to do. He's scared the heck out of me a few times.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 3 kabasawa 05.ogg}} '''Kabasawa:''' Ugh... It's a miracle the fighting has finally come to an end. I really hope we don't go making any more trouble for ourselves.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 3 kabasawa 06.ogg}} '''Kabasawa:''' Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have much information. If you still have questions, you may as well go and talk to him.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds promising. Let's go see what that guy's deal is, (Traveler)!

;(Talk to Kabasawa again)
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq004 kabasawa 01.ogg}} '''Kabasawa:''' So much fighting... we could all do with a rest. Hey, anybody need some fruit or vegetables? Get them today, they're on sale.
----
;(Investigate the suspicious soldier)
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... this guy smells of booze...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 01.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Mm? Wait, wait, don't tell me... Captain of Swordfish II! Right?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 02.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' You actually came back. I thought you'd abandoned the platoon and made a run for it.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nuh-uh! We would never run from a fight!
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 03.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Hmph, is that so. All anyone talks about these days is peace and stability.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 04.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Do you remember what the most important thing is to the resistance?
:{{DIcon}} A warrior's will.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 05.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' You got that right. So I'm gonna put you to the test. Time to see if you truly are a bona fide resistance warrior.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 06.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' I'll answer your questions &mdash; but only if you can beat me in a duel.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, this guy... Would it kill him to just have a normal conversation...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you think, are we gonna do this, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} Sure. We're hardly going to lose.
:{{DIcon}} In a few seconds you'll be begging to talk!
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 07.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Hmph... We'll see about that!
----
;(If the player loses)
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 08.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' That all you got? I expected more from Swordfish II.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 4 kouzen 09.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Come on! Again!

;(After defeating Kouzen)
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 01.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' You're a strong fighter... No wonder Her Excellency chose you.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 02.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' You really do have a warrior's will... Then, maybe you can understand us.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 03.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Captain, comrade... will you join us?
:{{DIcon}} First you need to tell me what's going on.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 04.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' ...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 05.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' We made it up. The story about the Tenryou Commission colluding with the Fatui... It didn't happen.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' WHAT!? Poor Kokomi's been worried sick! You're telling us you made the whole thing up?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the heck were you thinking? This could send you right back into war with the Tenryou Commission!
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 06.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Yes. That's exactly what we're hoping to achieve.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 07.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Peace talks? Pfft... Everyone's been drawn in by the idea. That's why the future of Watatsumi Island is at stake.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 08.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' What's to stop the Tenryou Commission from stabbing us in the back? And what's to stop the [[Raiden Shogun]] from issuing another Vision Hunt Decree?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 09.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' We are the resistance! Everything hinges on our warrior's will!
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 10.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' We can't trust the Tenryou Commission or the Raiden Shogun. But we can put faith in ourselves!
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 11.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Surely you agree with that?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' His point does kinda make sense, but something about it doesn't feel right to Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} What it boils down to is... you just want to fight.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Everything you said just now was pure speculation, wasn't it?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you seriously willing to make up a wild rumor and ruin the peace everyone's worked so hard for, all because of some imaginary situation that may not even happen?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 12.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Don't take that tone with me, acting like you're above all of this! What would you understand?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 13.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' For the sake of victory, we embodied the warrior's will to the fullest. You understand? We were all in. Now they're suddenly trying to tell us that none of it matters anymore...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 14.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' You'd have me just put down my weapon and start living like an ordinary person, but how can I? How can I, when... when every time I close my eyes, I see the faces of the friends we lost in battle.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 15.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' Every time I see them there, in my mind's eye, it reminds me that I can never forgive the Tenryou Commission, and never forgive the Vision Hunt Decree!
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 16.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' I guess you're not one of us... Well, whatever. Go ahead and tell Sangonomiya if you want. But you're too late to stop us now...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Too late? What do you mean?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 kouzen 17.ogg}} '''Kouzen:''' ...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Darn, doesn't seem like he's gonna answer that one.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are we gonna do, (Traveler)? This is really serious! We need to give Kokomi the full story right away!
----
{{Quest Description|update|The truth behind the rumors proves unexpected indeed. Kokomi must be informed.}}
;(Report the truth back to Kokomi)
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...So we found out a few things.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The whole thing about the Tenryou Commission colluding with the Fatui is baloney! They made it all up.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They wanted the peace talks to break down so that they could carry on fighting the war. And they said that it's too late to try and stop them, no matter what we do.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Mm. I see.
:{{DIcon}} What's the matter, Kokomi?
:{{DIcon}} Are you feeling alright?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I'm fine, don't worry.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' This is my fault. If only I'd perceived what they were feeling earlier, it never would have come to this.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I think I understand what Kouzen means when he says it's too late.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The talks don't begin until tomorrow, but both sides have already sent their guards to the location. They are responsible for making sure the area is safe and secure.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I highly suspect that one of Kouzen's pro-war co-conspirators will have infiltrated the guards with an intent to reignite hostilities tomorrow during the negotiations.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well that's no good. Do you want us to head over there now and switch out the guards?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' That won't work. Firstly, the act of bringing a new team of guards to a neutral negotiation site will put both sides on high alert.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It would almost certainly push the pro-war faction into taking action. They would attack the Tenryou Commission's guards, and we'd be in danger of war breaking out once again.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Not to mention that we have no idea how many of Watatsumi Island's soldiers are involved in this plot. If we change the guard in haste, we face the issue of not knowing who to trust.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like a really tricky situation... so, is there really nothing we can do about it?
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't let it worry you, what's done is done. Mm... Now it falls to me to devise a counter plan.
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' These soldiers crossed a line, but the blame is not theirs alone. Whatever happens, I will find a way to ensure they do not come to harm...
:{{A|vo xhlq004 6 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Let's meet here again tomorrow.

:'''Kokomi rushes back to [[Sangonomiya Shrine]], and the Victory Feast continues joyfully until all have had their fill.'''
