==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Wenze:''' Hello, are you also an adventurer searching for the Abandoned City?
:{{DIcon}} Abandoned City?
::'''Wenze:''' Oh, you haven't heard? Somewhere beneath these ruins lies an ancient abandoned city.
::'''Wenze:''' Rumors of such a place have circulated for many generations at the Adventurers' Guild, but nobody has found it yet.
:{{DIcon}} What's the history of this place?
::'''Wenze:''' These ruins were once a city, too. But it was probably abandoned long before even the Archon War.
::'''Wenze:''' It is said that beneath those two trees are buried the bodies of the last king of the ancient city and his enemy, who was also his true love...
::'''Wenze:''' They perished together, but their burial separates them for eternity.
::'''Wenze:''' The two trees that grew above the ruins once everything had turned to dust stand, just like them, face to face but separated...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You seem to know a great deal.
:::'''Wenze:''' Honestly, it's not much. I've loved history since I was little, and I've always wanted to see these ruins in person. That's why I became an adventurer.
:::'''Wenze:''' Well... these are some records I've made of my adventures. You can have them.
:::'''Wenze:''' Nothing would make me happier than to help someone else with my knowledge!
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Wenze:''' Goodbye. Ad astra abyssosque!
