==Profile==
Upon first meeting, Ararycan was scared of the Traveler since they encountered strange [[Aranara Language|Nara]] around the area. They later loosen up when [[Araja]] was mentioned, who told the Traveler that they can help them. According to them, something like [[The Withering|Marana]] is making the forest sick in places they can’t see. When the Traveler offered to help - like other Aranara - Ararycan spoke of [[Traveler's Sibling|Nara Varuna]] and compared them both. They investigated strange spots regarding the [[hilichurls]] that then led them inside the [[Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain)|Ruin Golem]], where they encountered [[Jazari]] near its entrance. He was the suspicious Nara that Ararycan was wary about, with him sneaking into the area with a strange machine that was just a [[Kamera]]. Like other adult Nara, Jazari can’t see Aranara either. Ararycan misunderstood his motives as he was only there to conduct research.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: First Chapter}}</ref>

In the search for the [[Amiti Device Fragment (I)|Amiti Device]] near [[Vimara Village]], the Traveler and Ararycan undid the [[Vamadha]] using the [[Vintage Lyre]] that was blocking [[Royinjan]]’s childhood secret base. A machine part of the Ruin Golem is present inside, where Ararycan moved it there before. Royinjan rediscovered their [["The Ultra Invincible" Adventure Handbook|adventure handbook]] and was surprised to see an illustration of three people, but couldn’t recall who the third one was. The Traveler then visited [[Amadhiah]] to ask about the whereabouts of the device’s fragments and provided it, where he also gave a [[Dried Flower|dried flower]] that will jog Royinjan’s memory. When asked why they didn’t say anything, Ararycan only said the events Amadhiah told were familiar and it made them confused, so they chose to be silent.<ref name="VARC">{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: Royinjan's Chapter}}</ref> While finding [[Amiti Device Fragment (II)|two remaining]] [[Amiti Device Fragment (III)|fragments]] in a different cave, they found another set of robotic components that Ararycan moved as well. The Traveler and [[Paimon]] concluded that perhaps it was Ararycan who used to play with Royinjan and Amadhiah when they were kids.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Royinjan's Chapter: Linga}}</ref> Due to the nature of the Aranara to forget, Ararycan does not remember any events of those days. The Traveler returned to the secret base after obtaining the last fragment<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Royinjan's Chapter: Yoni}}</ref> where Royinjan and Jazari were waiting and offered the dried flower to the former. He remarked that it was not his and to return it to where it belongs, to which Paimon handed it to Ararycan. Though with no memory of the precious flower, they like it and choose to cherish it.<ref name="VARC" />

While the Traveler helped Jazari operate the Ruin Golem<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter}}</ref>, Ararycan was waiting near the hand and managed to avoid getting hit by the machine’s arm. The filthy stuff harming the forest turned out to be the Chaos Core’s energy leakage in [[Dev's Cavern|Dev’s Cavern]]. After the Traveler took care of the [[Abyss Order]] and turned off the device, Ararycan thanked them and said they will be returning to Vanarana to celebrate [[Festival Utsava]]. They are still worried about the forest, so they will return after the celebration.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: Dev Delver Chapter}}</ref>

The Traveler came to see Ararycan sometime later, where they found them upset because the Abyss Order returned to make the forest sick again. They mentioned that [[Pir Kavikavus]] may have an idea on how to solve it but considering he is gone, [[Aralohita]] - an Aranara who accompanied him in the past - probably has a “solution” in the area where he stayed, hidden in a riddle and a "labyrinth" as he was fond of them. Once the Traveler obtained the “solution”, which is a transcript of Pir Kavikavus’ research, they sought help from Jazari who assisted them in sealing the core. With the forest free of sickness and the Abyss Order gone, Ararycan would return to Vanarana.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Until Vana is Healed}}</ref>

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Ararycan seems to be the only blue Aranara, still with a hat-like item on their head like some of the others. The propeller on their head resembles a dark blue four-petaled flower with lighter blue circles underneath. The Aranara symbol is present on their front body, and a wooden sword is on their left side.
