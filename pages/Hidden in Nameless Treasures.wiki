{{Dialogue Start}}
;(First time speaking to her about the Nameless Treasures)
:{{DIcon}} Regarding the Nameless Treasure...
:'''Linlang:''' This thing you've brought... It looks pretty good. This pattern also seems quite old indeed. Hold on while I open it.
:'''Linlang:''' There are some defects here and there, but if you're eager to have it taken off your hands, I can offer you a price. It'll be fair, but it won't be high.
:'''Linlang:''' I just had a look at this one. These markings are definitely those of Liyue, and you can see inscribed here an anecdote about [[Azhdaha]].
:'''Linlang:''' They say that Azhdaha was a dragon spawned by a convergence of the spirits of Geo in Liyue, and that even Rex Lapis could not easily subdue it.
:'''Linlang:''' Rex Lapis thus summoned three adepti to his aid, and together they created a cavernous realm.
:'''Linlang:''' Rex Lapis then battled the creature, luring it into the cavern, before ordering the adepti to seal the entrance, trapping Azhdaha within.
:'''Linlang:''' The patterns on the thing you brought seem to describe the three adepti joining hands to create the cavern.
:'''Linlang:''' I guess that there should be at least three relics of its kind. Combining all three should give us the complete item.
:{{DIcon}} You know all this...
::'''Linlang:''' Well, I do trade in items of all kinds. A little general knowledge here and there couldn't hurt.
:{{DIcon}} Liyue truly is a mystical place...
::'''Linlang:''' Now this I'm not certain of, but a senior of mine once told me that Liyue is too large, and its history is, similarly, far too long.
::'''Linlang:''' Don't be surprised if you find strange relics in Liyue. What we know of Liyue's lengthy history is but a single drop in the wide ocean.
:'''Linlang:''' Ah, but I digress. As I said earlier, there should be three of this item. One of them alone is likely not going to fetch a high price.
:'''Linlang:''' But if you could gather all three, that would be a different story. But this looks to be quite ancient. Gathering all three might be too tall a task...

----
;(Speak to her again if you have 1 or 2 Nameless Treasures)
:'''Linlang:''' If my guess isn't off, the object you brought previously is one of three.
:'''Linlang:''' It will only be complete once all three objects are gathered together.
:'''Linlang:''' If you could find them all, I would be more than willing to make you a generous offer.
:'''Linlang:''' I fear that they may be from too ancient a time, however, and that gathering them.... could be difficult.
:{{DIcon}} I'll give it a go.
:'''Linlang:''' Alright. If you do manage to gather them, please bring them to me.

----
;(If you have all 3 Nameless Treasures)
:'''Linlang:''' If my guess isn't off, the object you brought previously is one of three.
:'''Linlang:''' It will only be complete once all three objects are gathered together.
:'''Linlang:''' If you could find them all, I would be more than willing to make you a generous offer.
:'''Linlang:''' I fear that they may be from too ancient a time, however, and that gathering them.... could be difficult.
:{{DIcon}} Found all three.
:'''Linlang:''' You... actually managed to put them together? Please, let me see... Indeed, these three patterns, when put together, do tell the story of Azhdaha.
:'''Linlang:''' This crane must be the adeptus [[Mountain Shaper]], and this deer might be [[Moon Carver]]. But this last one...
:'''Linlang:''' Eh? It seems like this pattern has been... intentionally ground away by someone, to the point where I can't make it out. Who was this third adeptus? <!--Probably Cloud Retainer? Don't want to assume and get it wrong, I need more context on Azhdaha, but if anyone knows, please feel free to change this and link it to Cloud Retainer's page.-->
:'''Linlang:''' Forget it. These matters are beyond my knowledge. Regardless, this treasure is complete, and will definitely sell well.
:'''Linlang:''' So, would you like to take it for a keepsake, or would you prefer to sell it to me? I'll pay you a pretty sum.
:{{DIcon}} It's yours. <!--No dialogue choices other than this one.-->
:'''Linlang:''' Great. Please take this, then.
:'''Linlang:''' Still, why was the image of one of the three adepti marred?
:'''Linlang:''' Who made this thing, and who broke it and ground away the adeptus' image?
:'''Linlang:''' Right, it seems as if [[Soraya]] has arrived in Liyue. I could write her a letter... she would definitely be interested in this object.
