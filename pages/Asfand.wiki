;(Before ???)
:'''Asfand:''' I am Asfand, advisor of the [[Citadel of Regzar]]. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Asfand/Duel: Asfand|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Asfand:''' Haha, it was a pleasure to win.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Asfand:''' Well, it's a defeat in the most unexpected circumstances. One can't see the path to victory when their vision is too narrow.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Asfand:''' Greetings. This is the Citadel of Regzar, headquarters of the [[Corps of Thirty]], [[the Eremites]] that guard Sumeru City.
::'''Asfand:''' I have retired, but I have been asked by [[Rukh Shah]] to be an advisor because I have served in both the Corps of Thirty and other groups.
::'''Asfand:''' If there are any unexpected conflicts, you can call on me to resolve them.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Asfand:''' Safe travels.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After ???)
<!-- Confirmed this after Jnagarbha Day but could be earlier. -->
:'''Asfand:''' If it isn't Dehya's friends! Welcome to the Citadel of Regzar.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} Nice to meet you again.
::'''Asfand:''' Greetings. At my age, it's really nice to see familiar faces again.
::'''Asfand:''' Rukh Shah and I were talking about how well Dehya carried out the commission this time. Not only did she get to know the [[Dunyarzad|young lady of the Homayanis]], she also managed to make some new friends.
::'''Asfand:''' Dehya is a reliable partner and one of the best in the Corps of Thirty. She does speak too frankly sometimes, please forgive her if she's offended you.
::'''Asfand:''' For people like the Eremites who always have to be on the move and travel far away, it's always a good thing to have more partners on the journey.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Asfand:''' Safe travels.
