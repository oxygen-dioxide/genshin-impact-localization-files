==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Boileau:''' If we counted all the cases that occurred as "theater" as well... Most of the stories here don't have happy endings.
:{{DIcon}} A "case" did occur, after all.
::'''Boileau:''' Precisely. And where there's a case, there will be victims. It really is very sad.
::'''Boileau:''' Even if the culprit was sent to serve time, I'm not sure the tale could be said to have a "happy ending."
::'''Boileau:''' I've spent a lot of time at the theater on account of my love for tragic stories, and I've always found myself quite accepting of trials or performances that have tragic endings.
::'''Boileau:''' Over time, it's become less and less clear to me &mdash; am I sad on account of real compatriots of mine? Or on account of the story?
::'''Boileau:''' *sigh* This should not be.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Do not treat cases like child's play.
::'''Boileau:''' Yes, you are right.
::'''Boileau:''' They say Fontaine is the Nation of Justice. But I don't think such a reputation can be based solely on our Archon.
::'''Boileau:''' Fontainians must have their own sense of justice in their hearts.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Teachings of Justice|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Boileau:''' Tragedy can be beautiful too.
