|text1    = A great black monster that has come from the abyssal dark, eroding the memories of the earth. It can warp itself and transform into a formidable foe. Some of its attacks can cause stackable Attrition that, after a time, will cause your active character to lose HP. During combat, the Tenebrous Papilla will use Beseech the Dark to grant itself a Void Ward. At this time, use {{Color|help|a certain number of elemental attacks}} to break the Ward, which will cause it to enter a confused state. {{Color|help|Nightsoul-aligned elemental attacks}} will break the Ward more effectively.
