|text    = Lately, due to official duties, I've been staying in [[Qiaoying Village]] for a while. The serene beauty of [[Chenyu Vale]] is such a delight. Between work, I find myself gazing at the mountains or strolling through the woods, keeping company with the animals dwelling within.

Such a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere reminds me of my days training in [[Jueyun Karst]]. Even my midday naps have become more restful.

How about you? With all your travels, are you managing to get enough rest? If you have some free time, care to pay a visit? We could brew a fine pot of tea, prepare a couple of simple vegetarian dishes, and truly relax amidst nature's embrace. Oh, and I could sing you the songs I've recently learned from the children.
