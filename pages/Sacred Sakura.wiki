The {{Lang|'''Sacred Sakura'''|ja=神櫻|ja_rm=Shin'ou}} is a tree located at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] in [[Inazuma]]. All of the [[Sakura Bloom]]s around Inazuma have fallen from the Sacred Sakura.

[[Offering]] [[Electro Sigil]]s to the [[Sacred Sakura's Favor]] will increase the level to provide rewards and upgrade [[Electrograna]]. Every 25 Electro Sigils will raise the level by one. If the Traveler has sufficient Electro Sigils for multiple levels, they will be automatically used to reach the corresponding level.

==Lore==
The Sacred Sakura is a tree that represents the power of the Electro Archon. Its roots have spread extensively throughout Inazuma, and the [[Thunder Sakura]] were grafted from its side branches. The Sacred Sakura and the Thunder Sakura remove evil and purify the land by absorbing filth into its roots. However, the accumulated filth in the roots does not dissipate on its own, so it is necessary to routinely perform a [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual#Lore|Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] to purify the filth.<ref>World Quest Series: [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]]</ref>

The Sacred Sakura grew from a seed given from [[Makoto]] to [[Ei]] after Ei's present-day duel against [[the Shogun]] within Makoto's [[Realm of Consciousness|realm of consciousness]]. Having been unable to slowly ease Ei into the role of Electro Archon before her death in [[Khaenri'ah]] during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, Makoto inserted a portion of her consciousness into the [[Musou Isshin]], waiting for the day Ei could draw on its power and release her consciousness. Within this realm, the seed Ei planted retroactively took root in Inazuma's past, allowing it to grow so it could protect Inazuma while Ei eased into her role naturally. Ei speculates that Makoto's plan involved a "higher power," [[Istaroth]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Radiant Sakura}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* In the [[Version 2.0]] Special Program, Xiao Luohao, Head of the Creative Concept and Writing Team, explains that the design of the Sakura tree is based on {{Lang|{{w|Himorogi}}|ja=神籬}} beliefs and symbolizes [[Ei]]'s protection over Inazuma. Moreover, the design took inspiration from the {{w|quaking aspen}} tree, namely how the roots of many trees are interconnected and are actually part of one giant tree.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/l8YXe7EkmoU Version 2.0 Special Progam] (Timestamp: 31m)</ref>
* It is possible that the Sacred Sakura is sentient.
** [[Hanachirusato]] mentions the tree is telling her of its agony and that the Sacred Sakura can tell the one performing the Cleansing Ritual apart from other things and help the performer by creating opportunities for them to attack its [[Miasmic Tumor|tumor]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Yougou Cleansing}}</ref>
