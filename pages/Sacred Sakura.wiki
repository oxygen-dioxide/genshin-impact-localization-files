==Lore==
The Sacred Sakura is a tree that represents the power of the Electro Archon. This tree was planted from a seed that [[Makoto]] gave to [[Ei]] after her present-day duel against [[the Shogun]] within Makoto's [[Realm of Consciousness|realm of consciousness]]. It began to grow thousands of years in the past, even before the great flood that separated the islands of Inazuma,<ref name=":1">Mastery Domain Entrance Description: [[Violet Court]]</ref> and over time, its roots have spread extensively throughout the land.

The Sacred Sakura is the source of all the sakura trees in the region, with its roots interconnecting to form a single giant entity.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|3}}</ref> The [[Thunder Sakura]], grafted from its side branches, work together to remove evil and purify the land by absorbing filth into its roots. However, the accumulated filth in the roots does not dissipate on its own, so it is necessary to routinely perform a [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual#Lore|Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] to purify the filth.<ref>World Quest Series: [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]]</ref> Although it was planted from its own seed, it is likely that it fused its roots with those of the [[Irminsul]],<ref>Blessing Domain Entrance Description: [[Momiji-Dyed Court]]</ref> which would cause the characteristic glowing blue streaks that run throughout it and allow functions such as purification and the manifestation of memories.<ref>Story Quest, Raiden Shogun, Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter: Act II - ''Transient Dreams'', Part 1: [[Cleansing Light]]</ref>

Makoto, unable to slowly ease Ei into the role of Electro Archon before her death in [[Khaenri'ah]] during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, inserted a portion of her consciousness into the [[Musou Isshin]], waiting for the day Ei could draw on its power and release her consciousness. Within this realm, the seed Ei planted retroactively took root in Inazuma's past, allowing it to grow so it could protect Inazuma while Ei eased into her role naturally. Ei speculates that Makoto's plan involved a "higher power," [[Istaroth]].<ref name="Radiant Sakura">{{Ref/Quest|Radiant Sakura}}</ref>

As Ei had not been subject to the normal flow of time while saying goodbye to Makoto within the realm of consciousness her memory was not altered, and thus was shocked to return to Inazuma from Khaenri'ah to find a great sakura tree had appeared on [[Mt. Yougou]], which everyone she knew stated that it had "always been there". At the time she could only conclude that it was simply a miraculous effect of Makoto's consciousness;<ref name="Cleansing Light">{{Ref/Quest|Cleansing Light}}</ref> she attempted to prove to [[Yae Miko]] that there was a connection between Makoto and the tree, but as her intangible proof clashed with Yae's altered memories, she failed to convince her.<ref name="Radiant Sakura"/>

==Trivia==
* In the [[Version 2.0]] Special Program, Xiao Luohao, Head of the Creative Concept and Writing Team, explains that the design of the Sakura tree is based on {{Lang|{{w|Himorogi}}|ja=神籬}} beliefs and symbolizes [[Ei]]'s protection over Inazuma. Moreover, the design took inspiration from the {{w|quaking aspen}} tree, namely how the roots of many trees are interconnected and are actually part of one giant tree.<ref name=":0">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/l8YXe7EkmoU Version 2.0 Special Progam] (Timestamp: 31m)</ref>
* It is possible that the Sacred Sakura is sentient.
** [[Hanachirusato]] mentions the tree is telling her of its agony and that the Sacred Sakura can tell the one performing the Cleansing Ritual apart from other things and help the performer by creating opportunities for them to attack its [[Miasmic Tumor|tumor]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Yougou Cleansing}}</ref>
** According to one of the Raiden Shogun's voice-overs, [[Makoto|Raiden Makoto]] became the Sacred Sakura as a form of Eternity.<ref>Raiden Shogun's Voice-Overs: [[Raiden Shogun/Voice-Overs#Shogun|Interesting Things]]</ref>
* According to [[Yae Miko]], the tree owes its current foxlike shape to centuries of having been attended to by [[Kitsune (Species)|kitsune]].<ref name="Radiant Sakura" />
