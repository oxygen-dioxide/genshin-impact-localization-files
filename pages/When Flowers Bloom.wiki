'''''When Flowers Bloom''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] that occurs in [[Sumeru City]], [[Sumeru]].

==Steps==
#Talk to [[Vardan]] and [[Gurgen]]
#Wait until the following day (06:00 – 08:00)

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing the commission ''[[The Flowers That Won't Grow]]'' three times will unlock this commission, regardless of the version. This commission has two random versions, one with just a Mist Flower and one with a Mist Flower and Sumeru Rose intertwined. The correct version to get the achievement and the Whopperflower to appear is the version with the Mist Flower alone.

** Logging out or teleporting after finishing the Whopperflower version of the commission will cause the Whopperflower to despawn.

{{Quest Description|Vardan and Gurgen's Sumeru Rose seems to be blooming...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Vardan, optional)
:'''Vardan:''' (Hope I can deliver them in time.)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Gurgen, optional)
:'''Gurgen:''' (*sigh* It's so hard to cultivate the rose.)

;(Talk to Vargan or Gurgen)
:'''Vardan:''' Ah, you're finally here.
:'''Gurgen:''' Perfect timing. We're all set!
:{{DIcon}} What's got you so excited?
:'''Paimon:''' Could it be that the roses are about to bloom?
:'''Vardan:''' Yes, Hahaha! We couldn't have done this without you, Traveler.
:'''Gurgen:''' The rose hasn't reached full bloom yet, but you can see its extraordinary vitality from its appearance!
:'''Vardan:''' If you're interested, Traveler, come observe more closely.
:'''Vardan:''' It might just bloom right before your eyes, you know?
:{{DIcon}} Well, I wouldn't miss that for the world...
:'''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Really? Right now?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's getting excited too!
:;(Camera cuts to view of flower)
:'''Gurgen:''' Come, come, lean closer so you can see all the details clearly.
:{{Black Screen|You observe the rose bud with the herb growers...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Nothing's happening...
:{{DIcon}} I don't see anything...
:{{DIcon}} I can barely feel my legs anymore...
:'''Gurgen:''' Oh well... Maybe it was just feeling shy in front of you...
:'''Vardan:''' But no worries. According to what we know of the rose's life cycle, you should see it blooming by tomorrow at the latest.
:'''Vardan:''' Well then, please visit again tomorrow, Traveler!

;(Talk to Vardan or Gurgen again)
:'''Vardan:''' Please visit again tomorrow, Traveler!
:'''Gurgen:''' Please, witness its blooming with us!

===Whopperflower Version===
;(Wait until the following morning and approach Vardan and Gurgen)
:'''Vardan:''' Traveler, you couldn't have come at a better time. The rose is finally in full bloom!
:'''Vardan:''' Thanks to you, it is the best growing rose I've ever seen.
:'''Gurgen:''' The doctors at [[Bimarstan]] will be amazed, too!
:'''Vardan:''' No time better than now. Let me move this flower...
:'''Gurgen:''' Wait, what was that sound?
:{{Black Screen|Something is stirring in the field...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! A [[Whopperflower]]! Why is it even here!?
:'''Gurgen:''' Oh no! The field! It's ruining the field!
:{{DIcon}} I'll take care of it!
:{{DIcon}} Get behind me!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? The Whopperflower fled...?
:'''Gurgen:''' How... How could this be!?
:'''Gurgen:''' One of our roses, the most important of our herbs, turned into a monster and ran away!
:{{DIcon}} It didn't "turn into" a monster...
:{{DIcon}} It was likely there from the beginning...
:'''Vardan:''' You mean that the Whopperflower was responsible for the rose's slow growth?
:'''Gurgen:''' Is that so? Then the fertilizer used on it was a waste. And it consumed double the amount of water.
:'''Gurgen:''' Have we just been taking care of this Whopperflower all this time!?
:'''Vardan:''' Darn! How did it even disguise itself amongst the flowers? We never even noticed it!
:{{DIcon}} Well, everyone gets played sometimes.
:'''Vardan:''' We're in serious trouble now. Our field is totally destroyed as well...
:'''Gurgen:''' We'll have to explain this to Bimarstan and plant new roses...
:;(Commission ends)
----
;(After completing the commission)
:;(Camera view cuts to the area where the Whopperflower fled)
:'''Paimon:''' The Whopperflower fled towards an area where few people are, but Paimon's still kinda worried.
:'''Paimon:''' We should go take a look, just in case.

;(Approach the Whopperflower)
:'''Paimon:''' Look over there! A Whopperflower!
:'''Paimon:''' It's so full that it's staggering around. That's gotta be our nasty Whopperflower.
:'''Paimon:''' It stole so much nutrition that none of the flowers that were striving to grow could bloom!
:'''Paimon:''' You're not getting away with this! Let's finish it!

;(After defeating the Whopperflower)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, that's what you get for being bad!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we did what we could to right the wrongs for the flowers that had their opportunity to bloom stolen from them.

===Sumeru Rose Version===
;(Wait until the following morning and approach Vardan and Gurgen)
:'''Vardan:''' Traveler, you couldn't have come at a better time. The rose is finally in full bloom!
:'''Gurgen:''' Thanks to you, it is the best growing rose I've ever seen.
:'''Vardan:''' Thank you so much. Please accept these as a token of my thanks.
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, we're really happy that the rose bloomed, too!
:'''Vardan:''' Phew... We can finally deliver the roses to Bimarstan on time.
:'''Vardan:''' I do hope that the roses will be of help to them...
