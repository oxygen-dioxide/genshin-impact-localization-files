{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Tsurumi Island'''|ja=鶴観|ja_rm=Tsurumi}}|description=<p>Shrouded in a dense [[Fog]], Tsurumi Island was home to two ancient civilizations. One buried deep underground, before the time of the Thunderbird's reign, known as the [[Pre-Thunderbird Civilization]]. The other coming some time after, the civilization where a tribe worshipped [[Kanna Kapatcir]] (becoming known as the [[Thunderbird Civilization]]) and were subsequently wiped out by it. The land has since somewhat regrown and is now inhabited by [[hilichurls]], [[riftwolves]] and [[automatons]].</p>}}

==How to Access==
Initially, only the southernmost peninsula and the easternmost two isles by Tsurumi Island's [[Statue of The Seven]] can be accessed freely. The rest of the island is covered with dense [[Fog]] that teleports away players who venture too far or for too long into it. Players must start the {{Quest|Through the Mists}}, which requires the completion of the {{Quest|Seirai Stormchasers}}, to lift the fog and explore the rest of the island.

Most of the fog will first be cleared upon walking through a gate as part of the first quest in ''[[Through the Mists]]'', ''[[A Particularly Particular Author]]''. Players who venture into the fog without having walked through the gate as part of the quest will be teleported to Tsurumi Island's [[Statue of The Seven]]. Players who venture into the fog after walking through the gate will be teleported to the closest unlocked [[Teleport Waypoint]] located outside of any fog currently present. After finishing ''[[The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna]]'', all of Tsurumi Island's fog is permanently dispelled.

Teleport Waypoints inside foggy areas cannot be accessed on the map unless the player has cleared their respective fog area. This includes Teleport Waypoints that are inside areas with heavy visual fog but outside areas that fill up the fog gauge, such as the Teleport Waypoint closest to Tsurumi Island's Statue of The Seven. [[Portable Waypoints]] placed inside, however, can be accessed even after the fog has covered the island again the next day.

==Three-Day Cycle==
Tsurumi Island has varied chest and enemy spawns due to its time loop effect, which cycles every three days. Only a few spawns are unaffected by the loop. Notably, the [[Remarkable Chest]]s found in the world (rather than being spawned by puzzles) change between days, requiring at least three different days spent exploring the island to unlock them all.

The island will not progress through the cycle without starting ''Through the Mists''. The cycle will not progress again unless the second quest in the series has been completed. It may also be possible for certain quests or hidden exploration objectives to block chests or change the island's behavior.

The player can determine which day in the cycle they are at by teleporting to the [[Teleport Waypoint]] northeast of [[Moshiri Ceremonial Site]]. Near this waypoint, there is a bonfire with one, two, or three [[Pyro Abyss Mage]]s. The number of Abyss Mages indicate which day in the cycle it is.

The Pyro Abyss Mages are one of several enemy groups on the island that change between days, and it is possible for enemy groups to become misaligned with each other.{{Verify|how?}}

==Trivia==
* Tsurumi's Thunderbird Civilization takes inspiration from the culture of the {{W|Ainu people|Ainu}}, the indigenous tribe and natives of the Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. Places, characters, and other things in Tsurumi are named after words in the Ainu language, represented in-game as the language of the [[Ishine Script]].
** Notably, the Japanese version of the game does not use the Ainu language's small ''kana'' characters to write Ainu words correctly, and opts to use full-size kana instead; such as {{Lang|mini=1|ain=ピリカ　チカッポ　カパッチリカムイ|ain_rm=Pirika cikappo kapatciri-kamui}} instead of {{Lang|mini=1|ain=ピㇼカ　チカッポ　カパッチㇼカムィ|ain_rm=Pirka cikappo kapatcir-kamuy}}. (Ainu phrase from the description of [[Inazuma: Eagleplume]].)
* The {{Lang|crane|ja=鶴|ja_rm=tsuru}} &mdash; or more specifically, the {{Lang|{{w|red-crowned crane}}|ja=丹頂鶴 ''tanchou-dzuru''/タンチョウ ''tanchou''}} &mdash; is known as a symbol of longevity in East Asian cultures. In Japanese folklore, it has been fabled to live for a thousand years, and is said to grant favors in return for acts of sacrifice.
** This may allude to the persisting illusions of the people on Tsurumi Island, despite the original tribe of the Thunderbird Civilization having perished from incurring Kanna Kapatcir's wrath following [[Ruu]]'s sacrifice thousands of years ago. This idea of longevity can also extend to the lingering regret of the Thunderbird, which gave rise to the Thunder Manifestations of Amakumo Peak and Mt. Kanna.
* The Pre-Thunderbird civilization that used to inhabit Tsurumi Island  is likely related to [[Khaenri'ah]] and [[Celestia]], as similarly to [[Seirai Island]], the island hosts a massive underground ruin that contains [[Ruin Sentinels]]. Most notably, there are murals of Celestia depicted on some of its walls. [[Sumida]] theorizes that something may have fallen from Celestia onto the island (implied to be a [[Celestial Nail]], although the player cannot find the physical remnants of one in the area), which [[Kama]] suspects have manipulated the ley lines on the island.
** As a result, the "people" on the island during the Through the Mist series are simply ghosts reliving the past. However, one of them, Ruu, could hear and see everything around him and developed self-awareness. The spirits of the deceased can also be found on the island.
** However the incident surrounding Tsurumi's Pre-Thunderbird Civilization is said to have occurred thousands of years ago, which would predate the Khaenri'ah incident.
* [[Remarkable Chests]] were introduced to ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' on Tsurumi Island.
* Tsurumi Island is currently the only non-instanced area in-game that has varied enemy spawns due to its [[#Three-Day Cycle|three-day cycle]].
** This cycle may be a reference to "The Rule of Three," a concept introduced in the {{Quest|A Particularly Particular Author}}. Ruu explains that the adults use the phrase "The Rule of Three" to mean "you need to do things thrice in order to get a result."
* Even after completing the quest The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna, the fog is only dispelled on Tsurumi Island. On the water around the island a few hundred meters away, the fog can still be seen. The easiest way to observe this is by using a Waverider from two of the Waverider Waypoint located on the map.
