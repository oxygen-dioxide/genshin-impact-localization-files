==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Schulz:''' Looking to buy a weapon? You should talk to Wagner.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you sell here?
::'''Schulz:''' Take your pick from this selection. All Master's own handiwork, so you won't find any second-rate items here.
:;(Opens wares)
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing "[[A Long Shot]]")
::'''Schulz:''' *sigh* It's meant we've had a huge number of orders in from the [[Knights of Favonius]]... I was worried Master wouldn't be able to cope with all of them. So I tried to help out...
::'''Schulz:''' ...But the ones I made... at best, they were blunt, and the worst one was so brittle that it broke on the first swing.
::'''Schulz:''' Master gave me quite a scolding. "We can't give them junk like this," he said. "Not only does it put the customers at risk, it'll destroy my reputation."
::'''Schulz:''' I came to my senses after that. He was right &mdash; some things you only make worse by rushing into them.
::'''Schulz:''' I think I need a bit of hammering into shape myself, just like my swords do...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Schulz:''' I'm an apprentice. Name's Schulz.
::'''Schulz:''' Master's work is pure perfection. I never tire of watching him work.
::'''Schulz:''' I usually help master out with odd jobs on the shop floor. Getting some down time, where I can just watch him work his magic, is reward enough for me.
::{{DIcon}} Any of your own masterpieces to show me?
:::'''Schulz:''' I have tried... The results are usually less than perfect, though. Master normally melts them back down again and redoes them.
:::'''Schulz:''' There was this one I was quite proud of... But Master wouldn't let me sell it from his shop &mdash; said it'd damage his reputation.
:::'''Schulz:''' So I took it out the side gate and gave it a few swings. Ended up sticking it in the ground there.
:::'''Schulz:''' There's a group of kids who hang<!--in-game, "hangs"--> out over there, seems to have got them interested... Anyway, I digress.
::{{DIcon}} Anything in the works yourself?
:::'''Schulz:''' [[Herman]] wants a sword for [[Ellin|his daughter]]. I hear him talking about it all the time.
:::'''Schulz:''' He can't afford one of Wagner's, so I figured I'd make one for him myself, for free.
:::'''Schulz:''' I wouldn't call it an act of charity, it's not like my work is worth anything anyway.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} How goes your forged blades? Are they worthy of battle?
::::'''Schulz:''' I am far from perfecting my craft, but the blades are better than before. They're still not sharp enough, though...
::::'''Schulz:''' Here, take these. They should serve well to protect you. Besides, I cannot give any of them to Herman...
::::'''Schulz:''' I must forge a far better sword, one deemed worthy of Mr. Herman's kindness.
:::;(Obtain [[Silver Sword]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} About your master...
::'''Schulz:''' You'll have spoken to Wagner before I'm sure? Bit curt, eh?
::'''Schulz:''' I'd be hard-pressed to find a better mentor though. Just look at the weapons he makes, a true testament to how hard he works.
::'''Schulz:''' As long as there's mutual respect between us, I can't ask for more.
::'''Schulz:''' To be honest, I think Master would get lonely without me here. Last time I took a trip back home, for example...
::'''Schulz:''' ...Actually, never mind. Yeah... Don't bring that one up with Master.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Schulz:''' Alright. Swing by anytime you need something.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Schulz:''' Well, by the looks of you, I'd say you're an adventurer! Not going to stock up on some new equipment?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you have to sell?
:;(Dialogue response is the same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} About the Windblume Festival and adventurers...
::'''Schulz:''' A lot of couples will choose to have dates at Cape Oath, but there are some brave adventurer couples who will venture near Stormterror's Lair.
::'''Schulz:''' That area is simply crawling with monsters, so many adventurers will come here to purchase new equipment...
::'''Schulz:''' ...After all, if you were to be beaten by monsters in that place, you wouldn't just lose face - you'd be putting your companion in danger, too...
::'''Schulz:''' So each time the Windblume Festival rolls around, we smiths run brisker business than usual, so I suppose we can be thankful for that.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Schulz:''' Take care, and make sure to enjoy the Windblume Festival!
{{Dialogue end}}
