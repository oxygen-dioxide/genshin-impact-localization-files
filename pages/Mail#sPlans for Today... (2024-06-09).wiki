|text      = Now that the alchemy shop's running smoothly, I've had a lot less work on my plate.

The [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]] already reported to me some time ago about how much the alchemical potions have helped them. But I've been waiting and waiting and I still haven't received a letter from you, cutie. I don't even know how helpful the potions I made for you were. Have they made your journey at least a little easier?

Before you set off for someplace even further away, returning to familiar places to see your old friends is a great way to get yourself back in the right mindset. But I'm sure you already knew that, cutie.

As for what we'll be having for dinner, how about I let you decide? I'm sure you still remember just what I like. Hehe, don't you keep me waiting too long this time—
