{{Description|A faded wine cup that was unintentionally dredged up from the sea. Its dull exterior tells of the days it has spent beneath the waves.}}
'''Goblet of Thundering Deep''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Heart of Depth]].

==Description==
A faded, but finely-crafted wine cup,<br />Ground down by the sands in the sea's depths.

The exquisite cup fell from the Chief Mate's hand, raising tiny ripples as it hit the ocean surface.<br />What did it see amid the schools of fish in the dying light?<br />What had he encountered amidst the silent alleys, before the bars of the flower-inlaid windows of a secret tryst?<br />Down and down the dark gold cup sank, into the dreams of the sea monster, and into the dreams of the Chief Mate...

"Someday, I will return the favor for this mark of humiliation that you left upon me."<br />The moonlight illuminated sapphire eyes and that striking scar.<br />In his memory, her countenance grew brighter, beautiful, cold and proud,<br />But he had forgotten what he had said then, and grew suddenly despondent as a result.

"Come to think of it, how many times have I forgotten the past..."

"Ha, does it matter how you retell the past?"<br />"All deaths are in vain. There is no saving that which has already sunk."
