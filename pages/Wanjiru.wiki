'''Wanjiru''' was a historical figure from the [[Collective of Plenty]] in [[Natlan]], and was one of the [[Heroes of Natlan|six warriors]] who joined forces with [[Tenoch]] in a war against the Abyss, alongside her [[Tatankasaurus]] companion Kayeke.<ref name="TS">{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref> She makes her first appearance in the form of a spiritual projection in the {{Quest|Despair Engulfs the Heavens}}.

Wanjiru bore the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name|UWZ|'''Uwezo'''|bearer=1}}, which has since been inherited in the present-day by [[Iansan]]. Although it is unclear if Wanjiru possessed a vision, she was shown to have the ability to control the {{Electro}} element.<ref name="Sunset">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/aGtkhL8gDYE "Sunset" Animated Short]</ref>

==Profile==
Wanjiru appears to have been close with her fellow heroes, mourning [[Sanhaj]]'s death alongside the four remaining heroes and remarking that his death is a "rallying cry in our hearts." She also shows sympathy for [[Mavuika]]'s heavy decision to give her life to the Sacred Flame and reappear 500 years into the future, consoling [[Tupac]] that Mavuika needs time to process her emotions.<ref name="Sunset" />

Wanjiru has been shown wielding a bludgeoning weapon in battle, and has been known to wield the sword [[Sturdy Bone]].

Wanjiru, [[Menilek]], and [[Sundjatta]] perished in their final battle against the [[Abyss]], while Tupac clung to his life long enough to bring Mavuika to the [[Sacred Flame]] before succumbing to his wounds.<ref name="Sunset" />
