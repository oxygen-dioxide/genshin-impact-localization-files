'''Constellations''' are sequential upgrades to [[Characters]], which are similar to their Passive [[Talents]] and increase the effectiveness of the character or add new capabilities to existing abilities. Each character has a total of 6 Constellation levels, with the third and fifth always being a three-level increase to their [[Elemental Skill]] or [[Elemental Burst]].

==How to Unlock==
In order to unlock each Constellation of a character (aside from the [[Traveler]]), a player must spend a [[Stella Fortuna]] for that specific character. Players will obtain a character's Stella Fortuna upon obtaining a duplicate of the character, either through pulling from [[Wishes]], buying from [[Paimon's Bargains]], or earning through [[Events]].

The [[Traveler]]'s Constellations are unique in that they are unlocked not through the above systems, but through [[Archon Quests]], [[Souvenir Shop]]s, [[Adventure Rank#Adventurers.27 Guild Rewards|Adventure Rank Rewards]] ([[Traveler (Anemo)|Anemo]] only), and [[Statue of The Seven]] upgrades ([[Traveler (Electro)|Electro]] only) instead. The Traveler does not have a constellation until they align with an element.

==Gameplay Notes==
Aside from the Constellations that directly increase the levels of [[Elemental Skill]]s and [[Elemental Burst]]s, the effects of Constellations that affect [[Talents]] are not reflected in the Talents' information screens, even if the effects are unconditional. For example, the duration increases provided by [[Everlasting Boulder]] are not listed in the information screens of [[Starfell Sword]] or [[Wake of Earth]].

==Trivia==
* During the [[Labyrinth Warriors]] event, the charm "Exposure: Bastion of Order" was available, which increased the constellation level by 1 of four random characters among the player's two teams. This effect was only active inside the [[Mystic Onmyou Chamber]] domain and did not persist after leaving.
* As in real life, the suffix for constellations in the East Asian languages literally means {{Lang|"seat"|zh=座|zh_rm=zuò|ja=座|ja_rm=za|ko=자리|ko_rm=jari|sort=zh,ja,ko}}.
** Similarly, the prefix for constellations in Vietnamese literally means {{Lang|"palace"|vi={{tt|cung|宫}}}}.
