===Personality===
Much like Amber, Swan sticks to the rules of the Knights of Favonius handbook. In nearly everything he does, he utilizes the handbook as a guide.

===Appearance===
Swan wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt and horse riding pants with white plate armor worn on top. However, the poleyns, greaves, and sabatons are black. The Knights of Favonius crest decorates the breastplate and a sheathed sword hangs from his belt on his left side.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Swan:''' Hi. Anything the Knights can do for you?
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(Unlocked after completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Swan:''' Stormterror? One moment, let me try to recall the Knights of Favonius Handbook...
::'''Swan:''' I'm sorry, I don't remember anything in there that tells us what to do when facing giant dragons.
::'''Swan:''' Oh, but I do remember that it does mention how to deal with sudden threats:
::'''Swan:''' "When danger is imminent, please do not panic. Cover your head with both hands, and crouch down to protect your vital parts."
::'''Swan:''' I think l'll do as this says...
:;(Unlocked after [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Swan:''' It's over at last. We can finally breathe easy.
::'''Swan:''' We should suggest to the higher-ups that we need to add "what to do in the even of a giant dragon's appearance" to the Knights of Favonius Handbook.
::'''Swan:''' Still, such a thing is unlikely to happen a second time...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Swan:''' I'm Swan. I mostly perform sentry duty.
::'''Swan:''' I also provide any necessary assistance to our business visitors in accordance with the Knights of Favonius Handbook.
::{{DIcon}} Knights of Favonius Handbook?
:::'''Swan:''' Yes. The Knights of Favonius Handbook is our instructional guide, and also the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Mondstadt...
::{{DIcon}} Is there anywhere good to go in Mondstadt?
:::'''Swan:''' ...
:::{{DIcon}} ...
:::'''Swan:''' ...
:::'''Swan:''' ...
:::'''Swan:''' ...Sorry, I can't find anything at all about that in the Knights of Favonius Handbook...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Swan:''' Bye-bye!
::'''Swan:''' May Barbatos and his gentle wind protect you!
