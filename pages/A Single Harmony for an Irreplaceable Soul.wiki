==Steps==
# Wait until the appointed time (08:00 – 10:00 two days later)
# Head to [[Yujing Terrace]] and talk to [[Ganyu]]
# Go to [[Mt. Aocang]]
# Swim to the center of the pool
# Follow [[Shenhe]] to her cultivation place
# Head to the designated location
# Return to [[Liyue Harbor]] and talk to [[Madame Ping]]
# Talk to [[Dvorak]]
# Go to [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]]
# Go to [[Mt. Hulao]]
# Return to Liyue Harbor

==Gameplay Notes==
* In Step 4, approaching the center of the pool in a different way, such as through freezing the water or [[Hanega: Song of the Wind]], will still trigger Paimon's dialogue even though the character isn't swimming.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You and Ganyu had agreed to look separately for clues about the woman in Dvorak's story. Now, it's time to meet up...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like it's about time for us to meet up with Ganyu! Let's head to Yujing Terrace.

;(Approach Ganyu)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' *yawn* ...Greetings, Traveler and Paimon. Uh... what time is it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you okay, Ganyu? You were nodding off there... Didn't you sleep well last night?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Ah, I'm fine, don't worry about me. Let's discuss the matter at hand.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Since last time, I've been thinking a lot about the story Paimon told me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' In essence, someone rescued a drowning man and performed some music. If that were all there was to it, it could have been many people &mdash; human or adeptus.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But the tune was allegedly so wonderful that the drowning man forgot about everything else, even his own impending death, and only came to his senses after being brought to shore...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Perhaps there was adeptal power at work in that music that he, as a mortal, could not perceive. Or perhaps he sensed a power surrounding him, but lacked the words to describe it, not knowing where it came from.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Either way, if this part of the story is true, then the rescuer has to have been an adeptus.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You really think so? But this story's all the way from Fontaine... Isn't this a bit of a long shot?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, Paimon's really curious about how people from Fontaine think this fairy lady looked...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they imagined her having wings.
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, like a [[Crystalfly]]'s wings? That would be pretty cool, but Paimon definitely can't imagine any of the adepti looking like that.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they gave her horns.
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then she'd look just like Ganyu! ...Hmm, guess that does technically make sense.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, Ganyu &mdash; if you had to save a drowning person, how would you go about it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Huh? Me...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 09.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Um... well, I'd get them to the shore, and then I'd probably hide behind a tree and watch them for a while...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 10.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Once I was sure that they were going to be okay, I'd slip away without a sound...
:{{DIcon}} So stealthy...
:{{DIcon}} So cute...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it! So basically, Ganyu's the type of person who doesn't like taking credit for her good deeds.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 11.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' No, it's not like that... I'm just not very good at explaining things, and I also find it really awkward accepting other people's gratitude...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, what if this adeptus in the story had a similar attitude? That would explain why she just left without saying a word.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She was probably thinking something like... *clears throat* "Hmph! One was merely passing by, and saw fit to address this egregious disruption to one's graceful zithering at once. You may keep your thanks to yourself."
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 12.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Haha, that was actually a very good impression of [[Cloud Retainer]], Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 13.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' As far as I'm aware, Cloud Retainer isn't the most musically gifted... Still, we can't completely rule her out just yet.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 14.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Umm... if we set off now, we could head to [[Mt. Aocang]] and ask her about it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 15.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' You'll be able to confirm either way if it's her, and I can... um...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 16.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' ...I've been in Liyue Harbor for so long now that I'm just not as familiar with the adepti anymore. If there's anything we want to know about them, she's the best person to ask.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds great! And we're pretty close with Cloud Retainer by now, so we probably don't even need to bring her food this time, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 17.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I've prepared a gift for her to mark the festival, just in case. However...
:{{DIcon}} You still have some reservations?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 18.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Um... Cloud Retainer spends most of her days studying mechanisms in her abode. She's on her own so much of the time that the moment she has someone to chat with, she just...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 19.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' ...Never mind. I promised I'd help Mr. Dvorak, and now that I've made the contract, I can't be having second thoughts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 ganyu 20.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Traveler, Paimon, let's set off for Cloud Retainer's abode.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like this was a tough decision for Ganyu, but she's made up her mind now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon gets why she'd be so anxious... Okay, how about this: If Cloud Retainer tries to start telling stories about her again this year, we should pipe up and change the topic...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, did she leave already? Hey, Ganyu, wait up!
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... Paimon's so tired from trying to keep up. Don't either of you need to take any breaks? *pant*
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I can't believe it... Cloud Retainer is not here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Did we miss her?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' She doesn't like to travel, so in the past, it's always been the other adepti who come to visit her during the festivals...
:{{DIcon}} Could she be busy with something else right now?
:{{DIcon}} Could she have run into trouble?
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Somehow Paimon doubts that anything could cause serious trouble for her...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' True... now that I think about it, Cloud Retainer would be quite capable of taking care of anything on her own... there's no need to worry about her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Since she's not here... I guess the next step is to check all the other adepti abodes, one by one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh... Will it involve a lot more traveling?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Ummm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it! Paimon has a great idea!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Please go on, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Our goal here is to find the adeptus that helped Dvorak's ancestor, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can't hear any music right now, but if she's really as nice as the story suggests, she'd definitely come to help anyone who was drowning, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Yes, I think that's fair to say...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sooo, all we have to do is get (Traveler) to pretend to fall into the water, and the adeptus will come to the rescue!
:{{DIcon}} If you're so sure, why don't you try?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know perfectly well that Paimon can't swim! Paimon would sink like a rock!
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, I just think it's a bad idea...
:{{DIcon}} Ugh, I guess I can give it a try...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, just trust Paimon! The water's pretty deep over there. Quick, swim to the very center!

;(Approach the center of the lake)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Help! Heeeelp! Someone's drowning!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If only there was a kindhearted adeptus here to save us... Oh no, whatever will a Paimon do?

:'''Someone carries you ashore, so quickly that you don't catch who it is...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' What is going on?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' How do you feel right now?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Uh... Shenhe, and the Conqueror of Demons...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;Why don't you say something...? *sigh* Please don't make Paimon explain it...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay fine! Paimon will explain.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're looking for an adeptus who's good at being a lifeguard and playing music.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if the adepti aren't gonna stay at home, then how are we supposed to find them?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' It wasn't me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, yeah, so this adeptus is most likely a woman...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' And I am not an adeptus. As you both already know, (Traveler) and Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh... Okay, so this is Paimon's fault...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No way Paimon would've suggested this idea if she'd known how awkward this was gonna be...
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for troubling you both.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Glad you're okay.
:{{DIcon}} You're leaving already?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' As far as I know, the one you seek is no yaksha. And one last thing...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Your actions here caused others a great deal of worry. Do not repeat them again in the future.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' As ever, the Conqueror of Demons comes and goes just like the wind.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' R&mdash;Right... I didn't dare to say a word just now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' How's your training going, Shenhe? Have you made any plans for Lantern Rite? We could spend it together in Liyue Harbor, if you'd like?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I had planned to spend the festival with Master this year, however...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Oh, speaking of Cloud Retainer, when did you see her last?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Earlier this morning. She set off for [[Mt. Hulao]] at dawn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I noticed she was using an adeptus art of some kind to protect a mechanism that looked like a boiler. Maybe it was a gift for [[Mountain Shaper]]... I did not inquire.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Ah, so we just missed her...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Please excuse me for a moment. I think I'll leave the gift in her abode.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Sure. Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It sounds like Ganyu and Shenhe have gotten a lot closer recently!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Yes. During the summer and winter, I continue to train with Master. In the other months of the year, I have been learning to adapt to human life in Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 09.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Ganyu arranged accommodations for me in the city, and also recommended several work positions for me...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 10.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' But when I try to blend in by referring to her as "Ms. Ganyu" or "Lady Ganyu" like the others, she says I mustn't address her like that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 11.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Sometimes I'm supposed to copy other people, sometimes I'm not... It's a little difficult to keep track of everything.
:{{DIcon}} Ganyu just doesn't want you to be too courteous around her.
:{{DIcon}} Ganyu gets embarrassed when people call her "Lady Ganyu."
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 12.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Oh, is that what it is... Noted.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 13.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' So, you came looking for Master today because you wanted to ask her about the mystery adeptus, is that right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, speaking of that, have you ever heard any music while out training in the mountains?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 14.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Music...? What is that?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's... a kind of happy or relaxing sound! Or, uh... a nerve-wracking sound... or even a terrifying one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Okay, I'm done. I also left her a note so that she knows where to find us. We won't miss her again.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! That's really helpful, thanks!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 shenhe 15.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' We were just talking about this thing called "music." And based on Paimon's description... I do believe I hear it every day. Please follow me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 3 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, really? Great, let's go!
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' This is the place. I enjoy training here to the sound of music.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm... hmm...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, aaah!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, Paimon's gone deaf! Paimon can't hear anything!
:{{DIcon}} Me too...
:{{DIcon}} My condolences, Paimon.
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, phew! Paimon hasn't gone deaf after all! Paimon heard you when you just spoke!
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 05b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Anyway, uh... where is this music?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' The faint sound of birdsong, the quiet murmur of the streams... These are relaxing sounds. Are they not the music of which you speak?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... heh... Paimon wasn't quite done with the description...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay fine, it's all Paimon's fault! What we're looking for are not the sounds of nature, but melodies played on special instruments.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' And a melody is...?
:{{DIcon}} Go on, Paimon, sing us a nursery rhyme!
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 08a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, don't you patronize Paimon! Hmph, let's get one thing straight: Paimon knows plenty of nursery rhymes, but Paimon does not sing on demand! ...Without payment.
:{{DIcon}} Ganyu, why don't you sing that folk song you sing to [[Glaze Lilies]]?
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 01b 1.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Uh... Huh!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, why don't you just sing that one melody Shenhe's heard before? It'll probably help her to understand what we're talking about...
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:{{DIcon}} Fingers crossed this won't attract any Whopperflowers.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo eqhdj202 4 heroine 01.ogg}} '''(Traveler):''' ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪... ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Was that... from [[Where the Heart Finds Rest|the opera]] that [[Yun Jin]] sang?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm! That was a melody, and melodies can be called music!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...It felt like I was transported back to the past. In my mind's eye, I could see the [[Xiao Lantern]]s lighting up the night sky again...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...We're all there, raising our glasses and drinking to our hearts' content on the [[Jade Chamber]]...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' As I watched Yun Jin's performance, I felt a warm sensation in my heart... And as the drink reached my stomach, it went from warm to hot...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' When you hummed that melody just now, feelings from a whole year ago came right back to me, as strong as they were on that day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 09.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...So that's the power of music.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Shenhe... that was so deep!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Music definitely has the power to bring up memories. It's like a time capsule with all the special moments from our life squished inside!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about you, Ganyu? Are there any melodies that have left a deep impression on you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Um... I don't remember if my parents ever sang any lullabies to me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I know some local folk songs. And a few other things come to mind, too...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' The songs of the sailors down at the docks, the little ditties that the vendors call out in front of their beloved shops, the tunes of folk artists performing on the streets...
:{{DIcon}} All the sounds of Liyue Harbor...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Yes, that's right.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' In the past... whenever I heard the sound of those tunes, I always felt that they were worlds apart from me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Many in Liyue probably view me as a non-human... and they are right, in the sense that I never could connect with humans' artistic expression and their sentiments. So I haven't been able to integrate into their community, and be a part of their lives.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' At least, that's the view I held in the past. [[Sea of Clouds, Sea of People|Only more recently]] did I start to realize that... the only barriers are ones that I have erected with my imagination.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 09.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' The way those melodies make me feel isn't all that different from other people after all. They're about mundane details of everyday existence, life's ups and downs, joys and sorrows...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 10.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Even though we come from different backgrounds, and have different stories to tell... when it comes down to the most common things that we see and experience around us each day in the city...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 11.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' ...In that sense, we're all the same.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You go, Ganyu! You're really making progress! You have loads of friends in Liyue Harbor when you think about it, like ...Hmm, okay, maybe some of them are more like coworkers and bosses, but at the very least, Keqing and Shenhe are your friends now, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 10.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Yes. I am.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 11.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Technically speaking, we should refer to each other by the conventional forms of address used among fellow disciples. But now that I know what constitutes a friendship... I do believe we are more friends than co-disciples.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 12.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' ...Thank you, everyone.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 12.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Once the days are warmer, I would like to host you at my home in the city. Please invite Keqing as well.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 13.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I've planted many types of flowers. I'm sure some of them will be to your taste.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 ganyu 13.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Ah... you are too kind, I couldn't possibly...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 14.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Nonsense. You are my friend.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 15.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I have cultivated and cared for the flowers just as you taught me. Once you've seen them for yourself, I am sure you can advise me how to do an even better job next time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 16.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I will save some for decoration. We can feast on the rest.

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 shenhe 17.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...Do people say that? I'm not completely sure, either.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It doesn't matter, okay! You got the point across, no need to split hairs. Paimon's more concerned about your idea of a girls' night out...

:{{DIcon}} I doubt Keqing will be munching on any flowers...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph! Who dares refer to one not by one's adeptus title, but merely as "that illuminated bird"?

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 4 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One has received your message from Ganyu. On the matter of the adeptus you seek, one suspects to know their identity.

:{{DIcon}} Yes please, Cloud Retainer.

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cloud Retainer, why did you bring us here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Ganyu is of course familiar with the name "[[Guizhong]]," but have you ever heard of her?
:{{DIcon}} I've definitely heard it somewhere.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Guizhong is another name of Haagentus, the God of Dust. She was extroverted in nature, and adored social gatherings and inventions alike.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Long ago, this region was yet a prosperous assembly. Guizhong often invited her friends to visit her home, reserving for us seats around the largest stone table.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 04.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' [[Sea Gazer]] would always bring out his latest treasure and place it upon the table. *sigh* He could be quite the braggart... Though usually a mild-mannered fellow, when it came to those collectibles he was so fond of, he always loved to show them off.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers that name! So that's what Sea Gazer was like...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 05.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' He was an old friend and a former rival. One has many memories of him...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 06.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Once he had brought out the treasure, it would predictably become the center of attention. Neither Guizhong nor one was content to let him just steal the spotlight, so we would then also present our proudest mechanical creations.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 07.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' As adepti, we were each gifted in our own ways, and naturally proud of our accomplishments in our respective fields of expertise. As a result, one often quarreled with Sea Gazer.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 08.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' His treasures were not even of his own making. He just used his exploration skills to dig them out of the ground! How, pray tell, could he compare to me, when every single one of one's accomplishments was crafted by one's own hand!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Cloud Retainer, you are getting competitive again...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 09.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' ...Ahem, one digresses. Regardless, every time an argument occurred, Guizhong would come over to watch us during our mutual lambastings. On some occasions, she would join in, and on others, she'd take one of us by the limb, and start uttering the most ridiculous nonsense.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What kind of nonsense?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 10.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' No kind of nonsense were we spared. Sometimes, she would brazenly opine "Ahh, why argue between yourselves when neither of you could ever hope to beat me?" Other times, she would make unsolicited suggestions such as "Once you two are done arguing, let's go to the foot of the mountain and grill some meat..."
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 11.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' She always sought to make everyone happy, and one must say, she had quite the gift for it &mdash; no matter what nonsense she said, one never felt bothered or offended.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 12.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' ...It also helped that she never referred to one as "that illuminated bird" or "lady bird."
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You...! Come on, get over yourself!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 13.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hah. Anyway, just as our impassioned arguments would reach the apex of acrimony, [[Marchosius]] would bring his delectable dishes to the table.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 14.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Who would dare snub the Stove God and his wondrous creations? At the sight of him, we would all immediately drop the argument, and prepare the table for a night of feasting and drinking...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 15.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Heh, back then, one was always bothered by how the cups [[Rex Lapis]] brought were always too square for one's taste. Can you see yourselves ever enjoying a drink from a square cup?
:{{DIcon}} That does sound annoying.
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 16a 1.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Precisely! So as you can see, even one as great as Rex Lapis was not immune to making the occasional blunder.
:{{DIcon}} I don't think I'd really mind.
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 16b 1.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Then you are most tolerant. But that is its own virtue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 17.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Even one could never find fault with Marchosius' cooking. As we ate, Guizhong would continue to find topics for conversation, filling the table with humor and laughter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 18.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Each of those old fossils had their character flaws and points of obstinacy. So why was it that whenever we dined together, we always had a marvelous time?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 19.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' We would drink together from a spot high in the mountains, until the moon set and the sun rose, and only then would the banquet finally come to an end.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 20.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' [[Streetward Rambler]] would often remain to admire the flowers with Guizhong before returning to her own abode. The Glaze Lilies were far more abundant back then... entire fields of them would appear to the eye as a veritable sea of flowers...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Streetward Rambler...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' That would be Ping. You probably know her as "Madame Ping."
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, okay... Wait, this is a lovely story and everything, but didn't we come here to find that adeptus from Mr. Dvorak's story?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Or are you saying that... it was Guizhong? Didn't she, um... already, um...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 21.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Alas... Long has one avoided this place for precisely that reason. The sights here are a reminder of a time long gone, and evoke much sorrow.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 22.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One should have guessed that you would disrupt one's poignant moment of mourning with your incessant questioning!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 23.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' No matter... one will share the whole story with you now.
;(A [[#Gallery|cinematic]] plays)
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' In times gone by, one quarreled oft with Guizhong concerning mechanical principles
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' We each had our ideals, and neither would yield
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Under the pretext of a social gathering
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' One invited the impartial Rex Lapis
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' To judge the quality of our creations...
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' But Rex Lapis declared
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' That Guizhong's Obscuro Vulpes Mechanism was superior
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Though one was too proud to acknowledge it, in one's heart, one knew
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' That Guizhong was indeed the superior talent in the mechanical arts...
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' As for the story between Guizhong and Streetward Rambler
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' That begins with a certain bell
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' In Guizhong's opinion, while mechanisms were no substitute for human composers
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' They were yet capable of producing simple but fine melodies
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' But Streetward Rambler believed music to be an expression of the soul
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' An emotional enterprise that could never hope to be replicated by machinery
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' They argued endlessly, until one asked Rex Lapis to intercede
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' He confiscated the bell, and designated it for ceremonial use
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Thereafter, one would often find them convening in the mountains
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Discussing music, mechanics, and all the affairs of the mortal world
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' But these good times were not to last
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' War broke out between the gods, and soon engulfed the Guili Plains
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Guizhong was overpowered by the enemy, and fell in battle
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' When Streetward Rambler and I arrived at the scene at long last, all that remained among the ruins... was her lifeless body
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' After this, at Streetward Rambler's request
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Rex Lapis granted her the [[Cleansing Bell]] for safekeeping
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' To honor our friend's memory
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' One made a few finishing touches to her [[Guizhong Ballista|ballistic device]]...
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Many Lantern Rites have passed since then... many greetings and goodbyes
::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Upon what do you gaze? The Guili Plains?
::'''Streetward Rambler:''' No, it's... everything
::'''Streetward Rambler:''' We think of human life as like a lantern that's lit one minute and extinguished the next, but are we adepti so different?
::'''Streetward Rambler:''' Perhaps, as dust settles after a storm
::'''Streetward Rambler:''' We too must one day return to the world below
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 25.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One has always been austere and private by nature, and has never relished socializing. One's dealings with Guizhong were borne out of discussions on the discipline of mechanics.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You have loads of friends! And you seem pretty chatty...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 26.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Just because one is not ignorant of social graces does not mean one is fond of them! One is perfectly capable of partaking in conversation despite being introverted.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 27.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' But in the end, one is nothing like Streetward Rambler. She is dauntless but thoughtful, not to mention eloquent and wise. Moreover, her friendship with Guizhong was far greater than one's own...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 28.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Back when they were rivals, they would often compete against one another in the realm of musical composition.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 29.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' That Cleansing Bell was one of Guizhong's proudest works, having the ability to both compose and perform...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, that's weird. Didn't Madame Ping say she pestered an old friend for that bell?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And she also said something about being a vain beauty when she was young, or something.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 30.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Streetward Rambler, a vain beauty? Hah... My foot.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 31.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' That bell has a sad history. Clearly, she refrained from sharing with you the truth of its origins, since the right time had not yet come.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 32.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' As for her "old friend"... who else could it be?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 33.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' As soon as Streetward Rambler heard that a certain "Zhongli" wished to borrow the Bell, she realized that the man was none other than Rex Lapis, and that he had made an enormous decision.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 34.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' After all, we all have known each other for several millennia. Some things between us are implicitly understood.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, so they were talking in secret code? Paimon did not see that one coming...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 35.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph, enough of your intrusions... Where was one up to? ...Ah, yes. One remembers now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 36.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The Cleansing Bell is powered by a mechanical art, and can be used to great effect as an accompanying instrument. After the passing of its creator, it was used on numerous occasions during rites of parting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 37.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' But Streetward Rambler did not acquire it from Rex Lapis for the purpose of producing further funerary tunes. No, each time she rang it, it was to play the tune that Guizhong composed on it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 38.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The two once clashed over their beliefs about the meaning of music. Who would have thought that with Guizhong's passing and Streetward Rambler's mourning, two tunes composed in discord would eventually become one harmonious composition...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 39.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Once upon a time, Streetward Rambler also loved gatherings, liquor, and music. But after Guizhong passed, she preferred her own company. She could often be found sitting alone at a mountain summit, contemplating and reminiscing with her zither.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 40.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The music would go from mournful, to soothing, to impassioned...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 41.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Many years passed before she finally composed a melody to her satisfaction. In celebration, she played the tune to the clouds. Regrettably, one has only ever heard her play that tune once.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 42.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Which brings one back to the matter you've been investigating... Perhaps it was during that performance that the ancestor of your Fontaine friend fell into the water, and was saved by Streetward Rambler.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... if she was so happy with the melody, why would she only play it once?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 43.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One was also greatly perplexed by this. After suppressing one's curiosity for a long while, one finally approached her, and asked why she would retire the tune after having spent so long on it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 44.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' In response, she said...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 45.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' "Though the strings that played that melody survive, the one who inspired it is gone. Tell me, Cloud Retainer... when the one attuned to my soul is no longer here, who else could hope to understand this tune?"
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw... Poor Madame Ping...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I just remember being taken care of by you when I was young. Once the Archon War came to an end, I stayed behind in Liyue Harbor to honor my contract.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Although I met Guizhong a few times, I never knew anything of this particular story...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 46.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Guizhong was quite the visionary, but tragically passed before her time. Her manuscripts still lie unfinished in the Realm of Clouds... the blank pages give one cause for contemplation on what might have been.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 47.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Had you not decided to search for that mystery adeptus, perhaps these stories, too, would have been lost to the sands of time.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 48.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' As of now, you know the truth: That the adeptus who rescued the drowning man was none other than Streetward Rambler.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 49.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Do you intend to discuss this with her?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Do you mean... Ping might find the topic too distressing?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 50.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Precisely. The passing of our old friend is a heavy topic that both of us are usually careful to avoid.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' If I may be so bold... Cloud Retainer, could it be that this is just your own personal opinion?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 51.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Oh? How so?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I've been in Liyue Harbor for quite a long time now, and I've witnessed many farewells along the way. So I, too, am well acquainted with the pain of the passing of a loved one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 09.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But this doesn't bring the city or its people to a standstill. They have to keep moving forward.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 10.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Someone as perceptive and wise as Ping will surely have come to understand and embrace this.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 11.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Though these immortal mountains have lost an adeptus, the harbor of mortals has gained a wise elder.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 12.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' No loss can ever be undone, but there is always much that can still be gained.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 13.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Ping has helped countless people, and will guide many others in the years to come. And all to whom she extends a helping hand become her friends. People she can admire flowers and discuss music with.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 14.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Though it is heartbreaking to lose a kindred spirit, life goes on... because there are new friends waiting for you further down the road.
:{{DIcon}} Ganyu is right.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We even asked Madame Ping what she thought about adding a music festival to this year's Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When we get back, why don't we just ask her if she'd like to perform? Maybe we could even get her up on stage!

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 15.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Why don't you come with us?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 16.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' It's been a long time since you last spoke with Ping. And Liyue Harbor is always decorated so beautifully during the festival period...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 53.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Is not every Lantern Rite the same in this regard? Were there ever anything new to discuss, one and Ping could meet any day of the year.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 17.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I disagree. Each new day and each new year is different from those that have come before. How long will you simply let them pass you by?
:{{DIcon}} If nothing else, do it for Ganyu.
::{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 54a 1.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' ...Hmm, the edibles she brought this time were indeed quite delectable...

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 56.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Then one will be off. If the other old fossils have sneaked away into the city to amuse themselves, one shall soon find out...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 18.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Alright, we should be getting back to the harbor as well. We don't want to keep her waiting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 19.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' *sigh* Once the Guili Assembly, now the Guili Plains...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 20.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Say... if we planted flowers there and cared for them carefully enough, do you think that one day, we'd be able to recreate the sea of Glaze Lilies?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 57.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Allow one to take back one's praise from a moment prior. You are still far too given to flights of fancy, child.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 ganyu 21.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' What...!? Cloud Retainer? Y&mdash;You were still listening?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 5 cloudretainer 58.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One observed that you were making no effort to leave and returned to chasten and hasten you! This time, one is departing in earnest.

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 08.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hehe, there is no harm done.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 09.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' After all, Lantern Rite's very purpose is to commemorate the heroes who gave their lives for Liyue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 10.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Although Guizhong did not live to see the splendid sights of today, she was as much a hero as any other.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... so how has she proven herself right again, exactly?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 11.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Once upon a time, she said to me that humans were a weak form of life that she wished to protect with her wisdom.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 12.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' But as she interacted more and more with them, her opinions on them began to change.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 13.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' She marveled at the beautiful complexity of their spirits... the sheer splendor of all they could accomplish through their hard work and intelligence.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 14.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' She told us that to underestimate human potential would be to make a grave mistake...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 15.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' With the smallest amount of guidance, enormous power can be unleashed in them...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 16.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' And a human who has reached their full potential may well be her equal. Someone who could have as much to teach an adeptus as to learn from them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 cloudretainer 10.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph, she always had a way with words.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 cloudretainer 11.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' That her mechanical accomplishments were judged superior to one's own was, one suspects, in large part due to her sheer eloquence.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 17.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Speaking of mechanics, Cloud Retainer, do you still remember that potted plant mechanism? The one that the two of you gave me as a gift.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 cloudretainer 12.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Of course. Guizhong and one both put an immense amount of effort into that gift. It would be no overstatement to call it a testament to each of our individual technical genius...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 18.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' As Guizhong once said: "It takes every blade of grass and every flower to make a homeland."
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 19.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' ...When I see the sight of Liyue Harbor before us today, I am reminded of this.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Madame Ping looks very emotional right now...
:{{DIcon}} Well, she's been through a lot in her time...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 20.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' *sigh*... Of all of us, it was Guizhong who was the fondest of these grand and exciting occasions.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 21.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' If she were still with us, I'm quite sure she would still be trying to best Cloud Retainer's finest works at every opportunity...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 cloudretainer 13.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Liyue Harbor is always filled with the sound of music at this time of the year... If she were here, one is certain that she would seek you out to discuss and debate the virtues of various melodies.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah! Music!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been dying to ask: What was the melody that you played back then?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, also, with you being such a music expert and all, why don't you join the concert as a performer?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I can make arrangements right away!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 22.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Oho... As much as I don't wish to dampen your enthusiasm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 23.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' It's been a long time since I played this zither. My fingers don't have the dexterity they once did...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 24.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' And whenever I play that tune... it always reminds me of her. I start wondering what she would think of the changes I've made to her melody...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 25.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' There was a period of time whenever I started strumming, it almost felt like she was back again, sitting right there on the stone stool next to me, chatting away. [[Skybracer]] and Sea Gazer, too... looking just like they did in the old days.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 26.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' No matter how much time goes by, the moment that melody starts playing, it transports me right back to that time in my memory...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' So the past still weighs heavily on your heart?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 27.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I would be lying to myself if I claimed to have completely moved on.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 28.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' But that is not to say that grief doesn't get easier with time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 29.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' ...Despite the sadness, I have found many things that bring me joy in life. It is simply the nature of the world in which we live that even if one wished to mourn for an eternity, it would be a nigh-impossible feat.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 30.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Just look at this potted plant. Isn't it stunning?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 cloudretainer 14.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' It takes an honest and open mind to confront and conquer grief. You have indeed made progress.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 31.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hehe...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 32.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Be that as it may, I shall leave the Lantern Rite stage to the youth of today.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if you're sure...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Granny!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 yanfei 02.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Whoa, what's everyone doing here? Did something bad happen?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 33.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Ah, and now we've spooked Yanfei. No, no, everyone's just here to give me their regards for the holiday...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 yanfei 03.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Oh? That's wonderful! I'm glad.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 yanfei 04.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Well, in that case: Happy Lantern Rite everyone.
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Happy Lantern Rite. Oh! I... I just remembered that I have some, uh... work to do at Yuehai Pavilion that I need to discuss with Yanfei. I haven't been able to find a chance until now...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I will leave Mr. Dvorak in your capable hands. Cloud Retainer, Ping, we will be off for now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 yanfei 05.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Huh? Does it have to be right now? Which case is this again? Hey, Ganyu...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 34.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Ahh... It seems Ganyu still has much to learn when it comes to the art of deception.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 cloudretainer 15.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' What a pity... she has learned nothing of one's ability to carry a conversation.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 35.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Since it's been so long, Cloud Retainer, why don't you stay? I'll make a cup of tea, and we can chat a while.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 cloudretainer 16.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Gladly. This was one's intention as well.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 36.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' When you next see the Fontaine musician, please give him my regards. I'd like to wish him the very best with the concert.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You got it, Madame Ping!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 37.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Thank you all... I think you've listened to enough of my nattering for one day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 38.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' As for that melody, I will play it for you all another time. Goodness knows I need to practice it first.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that'd be great! We'll look forward to it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 39.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hehe...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 6 madameping 40.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' When that time comes, wherever her spirit may be among the countless grains of sand and specks of dust between the harbor and the mountains... perhaps she will look at the Liyue of today, and steal a smile when she sees the prosperous land that it has become.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's go tell Mr. Dvorak the news!

;(Talk to Cloud Retainer or Madame Ping, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Ping, what say you to convening more often in the future?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 madameping 01.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' That would be quite wonderful. But I must say, after all this time, I've grown quite accustomed to the harbor... When we are to meet, I shall have to trouble you to make the journey to the city.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' You sound just like Shenhe. The child is constantly telling one all sorts of stories from the city, as if one was partial to them...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 madameping 02.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Have you ever considered moving to the city, Cloud Retainer? There are plenty of people here to talk to. I think you would find it quite the antidote to the monotony of solitude.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 madameping 03.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' And if you looked around, I suspect you would find some young minds with an interest in the mechanical arts &mdash; some of them even worth training.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Haha. We shall see.
----
;(Approach Dvorak and Keqing)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mr. Dvorak!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, and Keqing's here too... Thanks for helping set all of this up.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Welcome back. Did everything go well?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really, really well! We found the person Mr. Dvorak was looking for!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 01.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' A&mdash;Are you serious!?

:'''You recount the true story of the "fairy lady" to Keqing and Dvorak...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 02.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' I see... So, the melody my ancestor heard was an adeptus remembering her late friend...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 03.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' That certainly explains why it was such a powerful and poignant tune...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. That's a really interesting first reaction. Guess that comes with having a musical mind.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 04.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' ...I have to say, though, it's hard to believe that the fairy from the tale is now an elderly granny...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon knows exactly what you mean! Normally, adepti don't age at all!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Streetward Rambler, or "Madame Ping" as we know her, probably only became old because it's what she wanted for herself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Madame Ping possesses vast knowledge and great wisdom. Whatever physical form she may decide to take, her mind and wits are as sharp as they come.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, Keqing summed it up perfectly! That's exactly what Paimon was trying to say.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 05.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' I think... Yes, I must thank her in person.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 06.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' That can wait until after the concert though. For now, I need to devote all my emotional energy to the performance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, speaking of, Madame Ping wishes you all the best with the music festival!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has a sneaking suspicion that she'll stay in her usual spot, but listen to the performances from afar!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 07.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' ...Wait, are you serious?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 08.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Huh... Oh no, now I'm starting to get nervous...
:{{DIcon}} Relax.
:{{DIcon}} Just treat it like any other performance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 09.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Okay, alright...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 dvorak 10.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Nope! Another rehearsal is in order. Please excuse me, everyone...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mr. Dvorak! ...Ah, he's already gone. Paimon wasn't even finished telling him everything...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Before we set off on our search with Ganyu, he asked us about what music means to people. After our recent adventure, Paimon thinks we have a lot more to say about that now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Please, share your insights with me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, well... we found out that music can be used for good, but also for bad.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... It can make people happy and moved, but it can also be sad and bittersweet...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And music is like a kind of memory written in people's hearts. It can put you in touch with feelings from a totally different time and place.
:{{DIcon}} Pretty much. Though there was more to it than that.
:{{DIcon}} That was a broad summary, but not the most detailed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It sounds like you had an eventful trip... Don't worry, I'm sure Ganyu will fill me in on all the details shortly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, does that mean you're gonna carry on working?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Mm-hmm. Just a few things to wrap up. All the groundwork is done.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' As long as everyone enjoys the festival activities, all our efforts are worthwhile.
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Happy Lantern Rite to you as well.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... that should be everything taken care of, right? Oh no, wait...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon feels like she's forgetting something... Ugh, what was it? Ugh, it feels like it was a while ago!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, shoot! Latent&mdash; Wait, no... anyway, uhh, fancy [[Bamboo Shoot]]s!
:{{DIcon}} Bamboozle soup!
:{{DIcon}} Made from "Nascent Bamboo Shoots"!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli said he wasn't in a hurry, so if we went now, there's probably still time, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, even if we don't make it, it's not our fault! He could've totally picked them by himself...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 7 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, anyway, let's go check with him at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
----
;(Approach Wangsheng Funeral Parlor)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Mm hmm! Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Dah-da-da-dah, dah-da-da-dah, oh!
:{{Introductory Note|Hu Tao}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Alright, let's take a break here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh wow, look who it is! Are you here to hang out with everyone's favorite funeral director?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you're just... casually practicing your rapping skills at the entrance to your funeral parlor... in broad daylight... Uhh, okay...
:{{DIcon}} You're, uh... freaking me out a little.
:{{DIcon}} I... uh... wow.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Heheh, after everything we've been through... you don't see me for a hot minute, and you're back to being scared of your own shadow.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' We have all this open space, a clear view of the mountains behind and the sea in front... not to mention we have several invisible audience members enthusiastically cheering us on! It's the perfect spot to rehearse!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Invisible audience members...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Gotta say, it took me a few days to get used to Director Hu's way of talking.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Xinyan was pretty spooked too when she first got here! Just like when she sees a frog. But a giant frog. With sharp teeth!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 xinyan 02.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' C'mon, knock it off.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' What's wrong? I've never seen someone look so confused before. Well, don't worry, because Director Hu's here to explain it all!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:'''
::There once was a Fontaine musician<br />Who went around town on a mission<br />He came door to door<br />For his Iridescence Tour<br />Looking for acts to audition
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' With my words, Xinyan's chords, and Yun Jin as our mentor...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' We'll take the stage by storm, with flames roaring, and the whole audience calling for more!
:{{DIcon}} Heck yeah!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For sure! The whole dance floor will be yelling "encore, encore"! ...Ugh, now Paimon's rhyming along... Um, but when you say "flames roaring"... are you sure this'll be safe?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 xinyan 03.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Ah, don't you worry about that! I'm pretty experienced on the stage, and I've already informed the Yuheng of all the pyrotechnics we're planning on using.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Guess we'll just have to trust Xinyan on this one.
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen Zhongli, Director Hu?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 10.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, Zhongli? He took one of those fancy meal boxes and set off for the mountains. Said he wanted to pay a visit to some old friends.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' It's a real pity that he couldn't be around for this. As well as being a true connoisseur of traditional art forms, he's able to appreciate Xinyan's performances, too...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 xinyan 04.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Yeah, that's right! Matter of fact, he was the one who first invited me to perform here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 xinyan 05.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' To tell the truth, though, I never thought I'd really find myself rehearsing here one day...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 11.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, well, now you know: The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is a great location! All of you are always welcome to come and hang out here, especially if you're in the mood to try something new!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I can speak to that. Hu Tao is always full of fun surprises!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 xinyan 06.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' ...And jump scares.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Actually, Xinyan, I have some lyric ideas for your part. Do you wanna go through them together?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 xinyan 07.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Sure thing! I'm all ears.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 12.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, (Traveler) and Paimon, I believe Zhongli was heading to Mt. Hulao. So, make sure you're hiking up the right hill!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 13.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' When you see Zhongli, please pass on this message to him: It's up to him whether he wants to support us at the performance tonight... but I expect him to make time for the upcoming banquet we're planning. No excuses!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 8 hutao 14.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' You should join us too! It'll be a riot. If there's one thing I've learned from being a funeral director, it's how to throw a party!

;(Talk to Hu Tao, Xinyan, or Yun Jin, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Okay, everyone, I think that's a long-enough break. Let's take it from the top, shall we?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ms. Yun is such a strict mentor! These breaks aren't even long enough to have a sip of tea.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Hah, well, you were desperate to get involved, and this is what it takes. If I gave you half the chance, you'd be sipping tea till nightfall.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Hey, how about I treat us all to some late night snacks once we're done! Hu Tao, whatcha cravin'?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hmm... how about some [[Stir-Fried Filet]] with a side of [[Crab Roe Tofu]]?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 xinyan 02.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Hehe... Where are we gonna find Crab Roe Tofu so late at night?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' We could always just go pester Masterful Chef, [[Xiangling]].
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Mmm, now I'm hungry. Alright, let's knock this out and then go grab some food!

;(Approach Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon sees them! It's Illuminated Deer and Illuminated Bird number two.
:{{DIcon}} Greetings, everyone. Long time no see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 xueyue 01.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' Hmm... A familiar face. Have you come from Liyue Harbor? How is the city nowadays?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Everything's great! But you know, if you're so curious, you can always go and check it out for yourself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In fact, Moon Carver has been taking many walks on [[Mt. Tianheng]] in recent times. I believe the sights of the city are quite familiar to him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli! Here you are. We've brought the Bamboo Shoots you wanted.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Impeccable timing.

:'''Zhongli puts the nascent Bamboo Shoots into the cooking mechanism next to him. Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper power it using their Adeptus Arts...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Traditionally, [[Bamboo Shoot Soup]] ought to be slow-cooked for many hours on low heat. Using Adeptus Arts to hasten the process is something of a shortcut.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, that mechanism... Is that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. Cloud Retainer kindly lent me her supreme cuisine machine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can we not just call it a "cooking machine"? ..Ugh, actually never mind.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She seems to take a lot of pride in her mechanical gizmos, so it's probably best if Paimon doesn't go changing the name willy-nilly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I trust that you found the answers you were seeking during your recent journey?
:{{DIcon}} Yes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Excellent.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The past should be remembered, but not overly dwelt upon. Our journeys should be seen as a means to take on more from the world around us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' When the Bamboo Shoot Soup is ready, I must insist that you try some for yourself.
:{{DIcon}} Of course!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Zhongli, Hu Tao told us to tell you something!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She said: "It's up to him whether he wants to support us at the performance tonight... but I expect him to make time for the upcoming banquet we're planning. No excuses!"
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When she says "performance," she must mean the Lantern Rite music festival!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As for the banquet, uh... she didn't tell us anything more about that, but she invited us to come as well.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As you can see, I have a prior engagement with two adepti friends of mine tonight. Please give Director Hu my best wishes for the performance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As for the banquet... Hmm, since the Director insists, far be it from a mere consultant like myself to refuse.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Then we'll see you there?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Absolutely.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 moutainshaper 01.ogg}} '''Mountain Shaper:''' Rex Lapis, the Bamboo Shoot Soup is ready.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Thank you. I will examine it right away.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The appearance is exquisite, and the aroma rich and intense. The craftsmanship of this machine is commendable indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 9 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Since you came all this way, you should not leave empty-handed. Please take some soup. It tastes most exquisite while still warm.
;(Obtain [[Piping-Hot Bamboo Shoot Soup]])

;(Talk to Zhongli again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I intend to reminisce with my old friends for a while longer. You ought to get back to Liyue Harbor. There is a performance you do not want to miss.

;(Talk to Moon Carver or Mountain Shaper again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 moutainshaper 01.ogg}} '''Mountain Shaper:''' Had one known that Cloud Retainer was in possession of such eminently useful devices, one would have sought to borrow one from her long ago...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 xueyue 01.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' And yet, since you share my lack of enthusiasm for mechanisms and fine dining, it would have become a mere decorative ornament in your abode.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 moutainshaper 02.ogg}} '''Mountain Shaper:''' Not so. Had one had such a device to make up for one's lack of culinary prowess, Shenhe would not have had to rely on flowers and herbs alone for sustenance while under one's care...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 xueyue 02.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' Hmm... in that case, shall we rendezvous with Cloud Retainer one day soon, and request to borrow one more supreme cuisine machine?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj202 moutainshaper 03.ogg}} '''Mountain Shaper:''' A fine idea... a fine idea indeed.

::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 dvorak 01a 3.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' I felt like it had a special kind of hold over me... Hmm, or maybe it was the adeptal power within the music?
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 dvorak 01a 4.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' And the ensemble at the end was truly sublime! I felt like I would have started to cry if I hadn't been one of the performers on the stage.

::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 dvorak 01c 2.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' This is what she said: "It is only natural to lend a hand when we see someone in distress. The wonderful music you brought to Liyue is worth far more than gratitude."

::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 dvorak 01c 4.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' But I've also made a decision for myself: I will strive to create even more wonderful, original music for this era... our era!

:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Performing at a music festival is very demanding. Using these herbs in good time will protect their voices from damage.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 qiqi 02.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Oh... that's why you were preparing them all night.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Hehe, I dared not neglect the Yuheng's request. Her messenger was quite insistent that it should take top priority.

:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 yanfei 03.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' And anyway, the sooner I start learning, the sooner we'll be able to perform a duet together.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj203 yanfei 04.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' A musical duo is only as good as its weakest link, so you gotta teach me all your secrets, okay?
