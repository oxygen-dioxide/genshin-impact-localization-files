{{Description|Despite often appearing in groups, the Nobushi do not have a centralized organization. Depending on the temperament or the nature of their crimes, they are also known as the "homeless ones", "vagabonds", "Kairagi", "ne'er-do-wells", or even "the rioters", or just simply known collectively as "those rogues".<br />They are often samurai who haven fallen into banditry, and some will even ally themselves with the [[Treasure Hoarders]] or the [[Fatui/Enemies|Fatui]] for survival or monetary gain.}}
{{Lang|'''Nobushi'''|ja=野伏|ja_rm=Nobushi}}, also called '''vagrants''' and '''ronin''', are [[Common Enemies]] found in [[Inazuma]]. They are wandering samurai who have fallen into banditry.

All Nobushi share the same set of common [[Physical]] attacks. However, [[Nobushi: Hitsukeban]] and [[Nobushi: Kikouban]] have access to unique elemental attacks.

==Notable Nobushi==
* [[Ronin (NPC)|Ronin]] &mdash; This unnamed ronin is a minor antagonist of [[Grus Nivis Chapter]], Act I: [[The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit]]. He and his group of Nobushi were stealing goods from the [[International Trade Association]].

* Unnamed Nobushi: Hitsukeban &mdash; This Nobushi was found on [[Yoimiya]]'s Character Demo: "[https://youtu.be/dn8etqEPtFg Dazzling Lights in the Summer]."

==Trivia==
*{{Lang|''Nobushi''|ja={{rubi|野|の|伏|ぶし}}, {{rubi|野|の|武|ぶ|士|し}}|ja_tl=wild warrior}} were {{w|Brigandage|brigands}} in Medieval Japan; specifically, they were groups of armed peasants that hid in the mountains and worked as highwaymen.<ref>Weblio: [https://www.weblio.jp/content/%E9%87%8E%E4%BC%8F nobushi]</ref>
*Each type of Nobushi uses the suffix -{{Lang|''ban''|ja={{rubi|番|ばん}}}}, which can mean "(one's) turn" or to "watch/guard", among other meanings. In this case, it is more of a classifier to denote the different types of Nobushi; for example, {{Lang|''Hitsukeban''|ja={{rubi|火|ひ|付|つけ|番|ばん}}}} may be translated as "Arson-class (Nobushi)".
*A rōnin refers to a wandering samurai who has no lord or master.
* As the Nobushi were originally heavy enemies on release, if the finishing blow on them ends up knocking them off their feet, they will not fall like ragdolls, say any defeat quotes, and simply fade away like other enemies as they get back up.
** However, they will still say their defeat quotes if killed in a [[Frozen]], Petrified or other status effect (e.g. [[Labyrinth Warriors]] event). This also applies to Kairagi, although their heavier weight makes the latter more likely.
