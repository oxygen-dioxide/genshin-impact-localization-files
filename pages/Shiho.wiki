{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Miu or Shiho)
:'''Shiho:''' Miu, are you feeling better?
:'''Miu:''' Ohh, how could this have happened? Not only has the author Taiyaki's latest work been delayed by work, but "A Country From the Center of the Earth and a Bouquet for You" will also stop releasing temporarily!
:'''Miu:''' But... But the two protagonists were just about to confess their feelings to each other at the end of the last volume!
:'''Shiho:''' Calm down, Miu...
:'''Miu:''' You don't understand! In the original series that Taiyaki's fan novel was based on, the two protagonists could not resolve their differences and separated!
:'''Miu:''' I've... I've pinned all my hopes for their happiness onto Taiyaki!
:'''Shiho:''' Um, well, if you wish for their happiness that much, why don't you write them a happy ending?
:'''Miu:''' Me? ...Well, actually, you've got a point. Be the change we want to see and everything, you know?
