The Sumeru Language typically does not use spaces, capitalization, or punctuation. These have been added to many of the deciphered texts below for legibility. Note that most of the text in the Sumeru Language do not match the official English transcriptions, if any exist.

For texts with unclear letters, the deciphered text includes educated guesses based on clearly distinguishable letters, the general shapes of unclear letters, and context.
