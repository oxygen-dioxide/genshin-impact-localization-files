:'''Quipia:''' You're back... Do as you please. I don't think you'll find anything of any worth here though.
:{{DIcon}} About the Saurian Relics Association...
::'''Quipia:''' I am simply here to stand guard over the excavation site. Perhaps a better way to put that might be... the only reason I'm here standing guard is so I don't have to answer questions like that.
::'''Quipia:''' If you want to know more, the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] would be a better starting point. Or find a member who's willing to tell you who they are before you've even asked &mdash; I'm sure they'd be delighted to answer your questions.
:{{DIcon}} About the value of collecting...
::'''Quipia:''' Perhaps its true purpose is simply the joy of collecting itself.
::'''Quipia:''' Whether most other collectors would see eye to eye with me on this I couldn't say, but nowadays, the sight of rows of neatly arranged collectibles fills me with nothing but sheer boredom.
::'''Quipia:''' If you ask me, it's high time we passed this burden onto someone else. We should be out there looking for something new, something exciting, something capable of actually inspiring people once again.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Quipia:''' Bye, then.
