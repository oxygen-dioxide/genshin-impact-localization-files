==Stages==
===Working Monster's Leisurely Test===
{{Description|A basic level designed by Haniyyah. It centers around that most common combination of Pyro Slimes and Blazing Axe Mitachurls. These simple and straightforward features will allow players to quickly understand how best to play the game.<br>According to Souka's comments, "these monsters are like workers hired by the Adventurers' Guild, with their job being to give new people their first test." Despite the analogy, Souka doesn't intend to pay out salaries to those "workers." In fact, she hasn't even registered at the Adventurers' Guild, or paid the fee.<br>For a Patrol member like Turenna, these are very familiar opponents indeed. As such, commanding them might be a slightly strange experience for her.}}

===Let's Call This Stage "Hilifungal Hymn"===
{{Description|A basic stage designed by Souka, with the opposition primarily being comprised of hilichurls. Congratulations, player, on starting the game proper! Using some Lil' Fungi techniques to gather opponents from various parts of the map is a surefire way to achieve a quick victory!<br>When encountering hilichurls barring the way during her travels, Haniyyah will often beat them like a drum... a rather rhythmic drum, in fact, which the Fungi companions are happy to join in on. This has led Souka to seriously consider if "the cries of hilichurls and Fungi can form a song of sorts," which is how this stage's name, "Hilifungal Hymn," came about.<br>Unfortunately, Turenna's orders might make the battlefield less flexible in this respect...}}

===Lil' Fantasy, Maguu Battle!===
{{Description|A boss stage created jointly by Haniyyah and Souka! The key opponent here is based on the Inazuman automaton, the Maguu Kenki.<br>Before Souka ever participated in the first Fungi tournament, she had already come up with many scenarios in which the "main character dispatched that mighty foe." Unfortunately, after a number of interviews with adventurers, Souka came to see this as "an impossible fantasy for ordinary people," sealing her original drafts as a result in order to avoid being rated as an embarrassment of an author who didn't even know how combat works.<br>Fortunately, after meeting the Fungi companions and Haniyyah, Souka realized that she might be able to challenge the Maguu Kenki if she banded together with her fungal friends! As such, after much thought, she decided to place a slightly tweaked automaton as the first boss opponent.}}

===Jelly Slushie with Double Sugar===
{{Description|A basic stage designed by Haniyyah. In her own words, "the mercenary bands I was with in the past were very poor, and couldn't afford the use of Mist Flower Corollas. If we really wanted to eat something cold, we'd just grab Cryo and Hydro Slimes and keep them in cages to refrigerate stuff for us." After leaving Sumeru with Souka to travel, Haniyyah finally got the chance to try real shaved ice, and found it much to her liking indeed, ordering at least three times the normal amount of sugar every time. Pity, then, that their fungal friends have no teeth, and cannot consume frozen Marvelous Gel...<br>As for Enghiene, who is taking part in this game, freezing is a truly terrifying concept, because even Tidalga would go down poorly in such circumstances...}}

===Great Boar King! Freezing Impact!===
{{Description|A boss stage created jointly by Haniyyah and Souka! Since they're here in Fontaine, then going to other countries is hardly out of the question! The two of them have considered going to Mondstadt in the past, and have, to that effect, long been gathering information about the special locale known as Dragonspine. The legendary Great Snowboar King has also been a subject of their focus. Despite the fact that they both have round bodies, Snowboars and Fungi fight very differently indeed &mdash; a difference most curious! And curious, indeed, is what one would be concerning a meeting between these two species of round creatures...<br>Shame, then, that Enghiene is adept at combat tactics, and no commander of reckless, rushing beasts...}}

===Click-clack Goes the Mechanical Rhythm===
{{Description|A basic stage designed mainly by Souka. You've heard that while she was looking for machines nearby, she would place her head to the ground and listen for their booming footsteps, often remarking on the autonomous mechanisms and their intricate design. "Even understanding one part out of a hundred of their design would allow me to make awesome pieces indeed."<br>However, this method proved quite useless in understanding the Ruin Scout, which hovers in the air. Once, Souka had placed her ear to the ground, listening out fruitlessly for over half a day, only to raise her head to find a Ruin Scout flashing curious lights her way. As to how she was then pursued by the machine for two straight days and a half, that is a different tale...}}

===Speedy Black Shadow! Sleeping Ninjutsu!===
{{Description|A boss stage created jointly by Haniyyah and Souka! This final, fearsome foe is based on the mysterious Ninken of Inazuman legend, and it is as cool as it is powerful! It is Souka's view that "people won't be mad if they get beaten by such a cool opponent," though Haniyyah did tune the dog's abilities down a little, with the consideration that the event is taking place in Fontaine, where people might have less familiarity with Ninken...<br>During a brief stint back in Inazuma, Souka met up with many author friends in the hopes of getting more information concerning Ninken. She even went to Komore Teahouse to meet up with adventurers who'd seen the Shuumatsuban in action, though she forgot to establish good relations with the establishment's boss...}}
