''Available before completing ''[[Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering]]''.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Taliesin:''' Hmm... no, no. That's not how that goes. According to the genealogy...
:'''Taliesin:''' Ooh? Oh! Hello, sorry, didn't see you there!
:{{DIcon}} You...
:{{DIcon}} I'm...
:;(Aether version)
:'''Taliesin:''' Shh! Shh! Ahem! He comes, he comes! His sword shining like the moon so silver, at his footsteps even armies shiver! He is&mdash;
:;(Lumine version)
:'''Taliesin:''' Shh! Shh! Ahem! She comes, she comes! Her eyes bright as the moon inimitable, her armor formidable, invincible! She is&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' Blon&mdash;die&mdash;!
:{{DIcon}} What!?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe... Sorry, force of habit. It just slipped out, y'know?
:{{DIcon}} What sort of habit is that, seriously...
:{{DIcon}} That lacked creativity in the extreme.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon supposes that the nickname could be uglier...
:{{DIcon}} Hey!
:'''Taliesin:''' Hahahaha! Well said, good Paimon, well said!
:'''Taliesin:''' (He/She) is the golden-haired (Traveler)!
:{{DIcon}} I object to these terrible-sounding, non-consensual appellations.
:'''Taliesin:''' Apologies, apologies... I did not mean to offend. But more "old-school" poets from Mondstadt do tend to begin like that.
:{{DIcon}} "Old-school"?
:'''Taliesin:''' Well, if you'll let me clarify, I don't mean old-school folksongs like the "Dandelion Madrigals" or old-school romances like "Marriage, You Cheat, How I Hate Thee"...
:'''Taliesin:''' I'm referring to old-school historical epic poetry.
:{{DIcon}} And what might that be?
:'''Taliesin:''' Ah, simply put, it is the adaptation of heroic genealogies, the adding of flesh and skin atop the skeletal frame of history!
:'''Taliesin:''' These epics sing of history through long-form poetry, awakening people to the knowledge of times past. Well, there you have it &mdash; the epic, and its value to society.
:'''Taliesin:''' The ability of poetry to awaken historical consciousness was precisely why it was banned all those years ago by the aristocracy.
:'''Taliesin:''' They feared that we would recall our former freedom and our history of resistance.
:'''Taliesin:''' And that is why I despise the popular poetry of the day and seek to revive these "old-school epics."
:{{DIcon}} I see. Bye.
:'''Taliesin:''' Um, right, then. See you, golden-haired (Traveler)!

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Tell a Tale for Taliesin''.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Taliesin:''' Sorry, I'm a little dizzy at the moment, but I can take it! Ugh...
:{{DIcon}} What is it you're doing here?
::'''Taliesin:''' I consider myself a bard of the old school, so of course I'm here to get some inspiration.
::'''Taliesin:''' That said, I've never gone down into a mine before... and in my hurry to get here, I wound up... pulling a muscle.
::'''Taliesin:''' Ow ow ow...
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you, then.
::'''Taliesin:''' Ah, yeah, if you come across any new stories, do tell me!
