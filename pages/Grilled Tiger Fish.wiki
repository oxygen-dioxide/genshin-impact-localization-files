{{Description|Traditionally, the dish now known as Tiger Fish referred exclusively to grilled Ticker Fish. Over time, however, the dish's name turned into Tiger Fish, and came to refer to grilled fish in general. In fact, the true Ticker Fish underwent a sharp decline in population along with many other sea creatures years ago, and is now on the verge of extinction.|[[Archive]] description}}
