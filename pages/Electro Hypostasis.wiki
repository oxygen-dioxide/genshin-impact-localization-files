For most of the attacks below, the core will be exposed for a few seconds after the boss uses the attack. Use this opportunity to deal damage to the boss.
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Electro Crystal Projection
|desc_1 = Flies into the air and forms a rhombus with its shell pieces, firing two each for a total of four attacks, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on hit. The core will be exposed during this attack.
|file_1 = Electro Hypostasis Missiles

|name_2 = Clap
|desc_2 = Quickly flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} in front of the wall.

|name_3 = Rock-Paper-Scissors Combo
|desc_3 = Performs a telegraphed 3-hit combo consisting of a forward punch, a "cutting" attack as a pair of scissors, and a ground slap with a giant hand. Sometimes, only the punch is performed, in which case the telegraph does not appear. This attack deals '''75% ATK''', '''75% ATK''', and '''100% ATK''' {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
|file_3 = Electro Hypostasis Rock Scissors Paper

|name_4 = Drill
|desc_4 = Turns into a giant drill and spins across the arena, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} continuously upon contact.

|name_5 = Tremors
|desc_5 = Moves to the center of the arena and forms a spinning dome formation with its shell while sending out many small waves of shell pieces, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on hit. When this attack ends, an Electro [[Energy|Energy Orb]] will be generated.

|name_6 = Lightning Lockdown
|desc_6 = Sends shell pieces into the sky and rains them down in an octagon formation around the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and trapping them, before raining lightning in the cage, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. The core will be exposed during this attack. Dash toward the first pillar, and then out of the cage before the complete cage is formed. The pillars can also be destroyed using elemental reactions as a means of escape. This attack is usually performed only when the player takes too long to defeat the Electro Hypostasis.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Electro|4.4|Cage Pillar|noec=1}}
|file_6 = Electro Hypostasis Cage

|name_7 = Rotating Lasers
|desc_7 = Forms a ring around its core with its shell pieces, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and begins firing lasers out in 4 directions. The ring will then rotate, moving the lasers with it, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on hit. When the lasers turn off, the shell pieces quickly converge on the core, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. The inside of the ring is completely safe, and the core is exposed for the full duration of this attack. When this attack ends, an Electro [[Energy|Energy Orb]] will be generated.

|name_8 = Absorbing Prism
|file_8 = Electro Hypostasis Rebirth
|desc_8 = When HP is low (approx. 5%), teleports to the center of the arena and forms 3 Revival Prisms, which can only be damaged using elemental reactions. After 15 seconds, absorbs the Prisms and heals for '''15%/35%/50%''' of its HP for '''1/2/3''' prisms absorbed. If a Prism is destroyed, it does not add to the healing and does not respawn next time the Electro Hypostasis uses Rebirth. When the player destroys all three Electro Prisms, the Electro Hypostasis dies immediately. Destroying a Revival Prism will generate an Electro [[Energy|Energy Orb]].
{{Elemental Shield Data|Electro|3|Revival Prism|noec=1}}
}}

==Strategy==
The majority of the Electro Hypostasis' attacks are fairly easy to dodge. Being an elemental being of pure Electro energy, all of its attacks deal {{Color|Electro DMG}} and it itself is also permanently imbued with Electro.

The fight itself is fairly simple and the boss can be defeated before it has a chance to use its cage attack. Players who get caught in the attack can either break one of the pillars with reactions or simply use height-increasing abilities (see [[Plunging Attack]]) such as a [[Geo Construct]].

When the boss reaches critical health, it will create three Prisms in an attempt to revive itself. {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}} and {{Dendro}} are the most effective at breaking the Revival Prisms, requiring a total of 3 [[gauge unit]]s for each Prism. See [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]] for more info on the gauge data.
