* While the Arena is active:
** Characters within it lose all [[Energy]] and cannot gain Energy.
** Characters within it deal '''120%''' increased DMG, and [[Nightsoul's Blessing|Nightsoul]]-aligned DMG is additionally increased by '''60%'''.
** The Wayob Manifestation summons laser beams that sweep outward in a X-shaped pattern 3 times, each repeatedly dealing '''23.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.
* If the Arena's duration ends and the shield is not destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation causes a massive blast, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, and converts the remaining percentage of its shield to a {{Pyro}} elemental shield.{{Elemental Shield Data|Pyro|48|Maximum}}
* If the non-elemental shield is destroyed before the Arena's duration ends, a massive amount of Elemental Particles will spawn, restoring '''90''' base Energy. The actual amount restored will vary based on [[Energy Recharge]], whether the character is on or off-field, and the number of characters in the party.
* When either shield is active, the Wayob Manifestation is immune to all DMG.
* When either shield is destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation becomes paralyzed for 5 seconds.
* '''Local Legend:''' This ability is disabled.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|The Flower-Feather Clan believe in and worship the Wayob, which manifests upon the land with the power of totems and Nightsouls.<br>They say that long ago, Wayob Manifestations looked very different from how they do today, taking on a rougher form that was more akin to that of an obsidian statue. But once their outline had been recorded in woven scrolls, there have been few changes in their appearance since.<br>The people of the Flower-Feather Clan believe their Wayob has the power to control fire and burning flames, and can also control the flow of heat and blazing winds.|[[Archive]]}}
