==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Dummy:''' Oh my, a guest! How rare.
:{{DIcon}} Rare?
::'''Dummy:''' We don't get many of you around these parts &mdash; these parts being what they are, of course.
::'''Dummy:''' I mean, aren't you concerned that we might be some sort of illegal establishment?
::'''Dummy:''' Haha, I kid, I kid. Please don't tell the boss that I'm scaring customers away again.
:{{DIcon}} So, what's your story?
::'''Dummy:''' Me? Well, I had a bit of a bad name in the past. Roamed the streets, got into fights.
::'''Dummy:''' Had my eye on [[Mr. Zhu]] here. Could see in a blink that he was some rich guy, so I came here. You know, earn some cash, pass the time.
::'''Dummy:''' But the days have been way more leisurely than I thought they'd be. Before I knew it, I didn't have that fire in me anymore.
::'''Dummy:''' Now I just want to find a girl to marry... Maybe it's the age or maybe it's this peaceful life, but I've changed...
:{{DIcon}} Farewell, then.
::'''Dummy:''' You too. Go well.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Dummy is likely a reference to the Chinese voice acting director for Genshin [https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/%E5%BD%AD%E5%8D%9A Bo Peng ({{zh|彭博}})], who also voices Zhongli in Chinese. One of his nicknames is {{zh|阿笨}}, which is Dummy's Chinese name.
