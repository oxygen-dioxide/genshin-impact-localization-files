==Trivia==
* His clothing, especially his {{w|deerstalker}}, is a visual shorthand for a detective, due to its association with {{w|Sherlock Holmes}}. Deerstalkers were considered traditional rural wear, and the fashion-conscious Holmes would not normally wear one in London. However, the cap became culturally associated with him through its frequent use in later depictions of the character, likely based on a passage in the story ''{{w|The Adventure of Silver Blaze}},'' in which Holmes investigates a murder in the countryside and is described as wearing an "ear-flapped travelling cap."
