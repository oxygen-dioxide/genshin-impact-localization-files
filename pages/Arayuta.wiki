;(Talk to Arayuta)
:'''Arayuta:''' Nara {{Traveler}}, you are as valiant as Nara Varuna in the stories!
:'''Arayuta:''' This time, Aradashan and I won't help you suppress the power of Bulky Iron Chunk. It will be more like the Bulky Iron Chunk in the stories. Worry not, Arasata and Arasaha will still help you!
:'''Arayuta:''' So, Nara {{Traveler}}, what do you say?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Arayuta:''' I'm sure you'll do fine, Nara {{Traveler}}!
:{{DIcon}} I'll need to prepare first.
::'''Arayuta:''' Okay... Tell me once you are ready!

:'''Arayuta:''' Come to Arayuta, Nara {{Traveler}}, if you want to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk with two stacks of Ararakalari lifted.
:'''Arayuta:''' Do you wish to fight again?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go for one more round!
::'''Arayuta:''' So happy to see Nara {{Traveler}} fight again!
