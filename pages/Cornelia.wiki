::'''Cornelia:''' Ah, so you're just a visiting guest.
::'''Cornelia:''' My apologies, I thought you were a citizen here on business.
::'''Cornelia:''' Since I've been placed here closest to the gate, people always ask me for directions.
::{{DIcon}} That sounds like a tough job.
:::'''Cornelia:''' It's fine. I don't think so.
:::'''Cornelia:''' Interaction brings color to an otherwise ordinary life, and it helps to make your mind more agile.
:::'''Cornelia:''' The longer you work here, the more you realize how important this agility is. 
:{{DIcon}} I shan't bother you, then.
::'''Cornelia:''' See you, in that case.
