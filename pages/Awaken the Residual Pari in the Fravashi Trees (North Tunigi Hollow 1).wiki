;(If first time encountering a Fravashi Tree)
;(If ''[[As the Khvarena's Light Shows]]'' has not been started yet)
::'''Sorush:''' Hmph, is this how they look like now? How pathetic.
::'''Paimon:''' Sorush, what are you talking about?
::'''Sorush:''' Never mind. I just happened to witness the undignified states of my kind. No matter, we shall keep going.
;(If ''As the Khvarena's Light Shows'' has been started)<!-- May potentially need to be completed? -->
::'''Sorush:''' Is this how they look like now? How pitiful.	
::'''Paimon:''' Sorush, what are you talking about?	
::'''Sorush:''' Never mind. I just happened to witness the undignified states of my kind, but it's no matter.	
:'''Paimon:''' You see, that makes Paimon even more curious!
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon have a look... Oh wow, that really is one strange tree! The way it's shaped like a circle looks almost like a door, right?
:{{DIcon}} If we walk through it...
:{{DIcon}} It might lead somewhere.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon definitely would like to go first!
:'''Sorush:''' ...The Fravashi Trees are no doors. You'll disturb the residual Pari residing within if you simply barge through them.
:'''Paimon:''' So that's called a Fravashi Tree, huh? But where are the residual Pari... Paimon can't see them at all!
;(If ''As the Khvarena's Light Shows'' has not been started yet)
::'''Sorush:''' Of course Pale Floater can't see them. They are still trapped by obsessions of the past, after all.
::'''Sorush:''' It may not be what they wished for, but looking at the sight of them clinging desperately to this world... How absurd and pathetic.
::'''Paimon:''' They may look a little strange, but calling them pathetic is just mean!
::'''Paimon:''' And looking at you being surrounded by so many plants, Paimon actually thought you'd feel at home.
::'''Sorush:''' Hmph, I only feel at home when I'm on a battlefield. Only the battle lasting until the end of time can be perceived as true eternity!
::'''Sorush:''' Now that you're following me, you'd better grasp that as early as possible, Pale Floater.
::'''Sorush:''' These Fravashi Trees are Pari that fought till the very end against the defilement that had been corrupting the land. Using the last remnants of their power, they transformed into this state that you see now.
;(If ''As the Khvarena's Light Shows'' has been started)
::'''Sorush:''' It may not be what they wished for, but looking at the sight of them clinging desperately to this world... I can hardly bear this scene.	
::'''Paimon:''' Looks pretty lush to Paimon. Doesn't it look nice?	
::'''Sorush:''' Hmph, as if you understand the situation, Pale Floater. These Fravashi Trees are Pari that fought till the very end against the defilement that had been corrupting the land. Using the last remnants of their power, they transformed into this state that you see now.
:'''Sorush:''' They exhausted their strength, to the point where they could no longer maintain their form, and were rejected by the Vourukasha Oasis for being tainted.
:'''Sorush:''' Legend has it that in ancient times, the Order of Skeptics would hold a ritual of purification for them, so as to bring them all back to the Vourukasha Oasis.
:'''Sorush:''' But nowadays, there remains no one in the Order of Skeptics who is able to perform such a ritual. The best they can do is but to keep these Fravashi Trees alive.
:'''Sorush:''' But this only prolongs their suffering. Judging by their current appearance, they seem to have nothing left but the bitter memories they have to endure alone.
:'''Sorush:''' In a way, they have also fulfilled their mission. But it was all a meaningless act compared to a true sacrifice.
:{{DIcon}} Looks like we should help them.
:{{DIcon}} So there is a way to save them.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon can't just leave them here to suffer and endure alone like this!
;(If ''As the Khvarena's Light Shows'' has not been started yet)
::'''Sorush:''' You can't? That makes you weak, Pale Floater. Being compassionate is indeed one of the great Simurgh's many noble qualities, but one cannot survive here with merely a kind heart.
::'''Sorush:''' Besides, for us Pari, to exhaust our strength in the final stand against evil is already the best ending one can dream of. I see no necessity to change anything.
;(If ''As the Khvarena's Light Shows'' has been started)
::'''Sorush:''' That said, such is our fate. Perhaps it is their wish to continue guarding this land in such a manner.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's what you think. Perhaps they have different ideas, y'know!
:'''Paimon:''' If Paimon was trapped here, Paimon would definitely want to go back home and be with everyone else...
;(If ''As the Khvarena's Light Shows'' has not been started yet)
::'''Sorush:''' We Pari share no such weaknesses!
::'''Sorush:''' Hmph, fine, since even my Yasnapati fancies so. I shall wake her up with my power and let you listen to her dimming voice.
;(If ''As the Khvarena's Light Shows'' has been started)
::'''Sorush:''' Pale Floater, how dare you underestimate our will!	
::'''Sorush:''' Hmph, fine. I shall wake her up with my power and let you listen to her dimming voice.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Fravashi Tree)
:'''Paimon:''' It's a Fravashi Tree. We can't just leave it be!

;(Talk to the Pari)
:'''Residual Pari of the Forest:''' Haha! Is that all you got?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Who are you talking to...?
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! Something's about to attack us!

;(Talk to the Pari after defeating the enemies)
:'''Residual Pari of the Forest:''' Hmph, they ain't nothin'!
:'''Residual Pari of the Forest:''' Come forth and perish!
{{Dialogue End}}

<section begin="first clear" />{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If first time clearing a Fravashi Tree challenge)
:'''Paimon:''' Something sparkly just floated out from that tree. Is it some kinda fruit? Looks pretty magical to Paimon!
;(If Plume of Purifying Light has not been encountered)
::'''Sorush:''' It is a [[Plume of Purifying Light]]! I don't know how, but the obsession contained within it has been cleared away.
::'''Paimon:''' Let's take it for now anyway. It might be of use to us later.
;(If Plume of Purifying Light has already been encountered)
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon thinks we've seen something like this before. It's a Plume of Purifying Light! But how did the residual Pari in the tree turn into one of those?
::'''Paimon:''' It seems that the obsession contained within has been cleared away, though I'm not sure how that happened.
::'''Paimon:''' Let's go tell Zurvan about this when we have the time. She'll know something, Paimon's sure of it.
