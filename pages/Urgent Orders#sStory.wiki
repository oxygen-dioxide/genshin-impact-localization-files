;(Begin event)
:'''Xilonen:''' *yawn* Lunch break is over. I guess it's time to get back to work.
:'''Xilonen:''' So these are the urgent orders from the tribe? Hmm, pretty manageable. If I finish them early, I might get to nap a bit longer...
::The Alpaca's patience will decrease over time. You need to complete the orders before it loses its patience.

::Click to view the list of orders

::You must collect a certain amount of Inspiration before you can start forging.
;(After obtaining Durable Pickaxe)
::Click on different objects in the environment to obtain Inspiration

::Once you have gathered all the Inspiration, click the forge to start forging.

;(Start forging after obtaining enough Inspiration)
:'''Xilonen:''' I've got an idea! Time to get to work!
:'''Xilonen:''' Well then, I'll leave the delivery to you. I'll treat you to a drink when you get back.

===Interactions===
;(Interact with Xilonen)
:;(One of the following lines will be randomly played)

::'''Xilonen:''' I've selected the materials, and as for the design...

;(Interact with the Delivery Alpaca)
::'''Xilonen:''' There there, just give me a while more and I'll be done.

;(Interact with the [[Tepetlisaurus Whelp]])
:'''Xilonen:''' Full already? Stay put and don't run off.

;(Interact with the tree)
:'''Xilonen:''' I'll just lie down for a bit. Remember to wake me up...

;(Interact with the pond)
:'''Xilonen:''' The water in the pond is pretty cooling... Ah, I feel more awake after washing my face.

;(Interact with the same entity twice)
:'''Xilonen:''' Maybe I should stay somewhere else for a while.

;(If the Delivery Alpaca loses its patience and runs away)
::Oh no, the Delivery Alpaca has disappeared without a trace!
::Follow our official social media account to continue your experience.

::The Alpaca has returned with the gifts for the forging commissions!
:'''Xilonen:''' Quite precious gifts. Let me find some nice place to display them.
