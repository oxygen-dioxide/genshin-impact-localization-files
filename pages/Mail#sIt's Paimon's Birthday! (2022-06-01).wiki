|text    = Yay, Paimon's birthday is fiiiinally here! Paimon wants to make three wishes!

Paimon wishes that we can travel to more interesting places, taste MORE delicious food, make a lot of new friends, and leave our footprints in every nook and cranny of this world!

Paimon's second wish...

Wh-What? Why are you looking at Paimon like that, [[Traveler]]? As long as it all fits in one sentence, that only counts as one single wish, right? It took Paimon a long time to figure this out!

F-Fine... Well, delicious food is a must! Fun places... It's also a big yes from Paimon.

So this leaves Paimon with one last wish... Hmmm... Well, Paimon just wants the Traveler to be happy every day, hehe.

That way, all of Paimon's wishes will come true! Paimon's the smartest, hehe!
