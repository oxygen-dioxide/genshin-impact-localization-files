==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Wuyuan:''' Hello! Yes, it really is me! Thanks for being my fan.
:'''Wuyuan:''' Come on then! Hand over your copy of Records of Jueyun and I'll sign it for you.
:'''Wuyuan:''' Didn't bring it? No worries &mdash; I've got a few autographed copies here, I can give you one free of charge!
:{{DIcon}} Why would I want your autograph?
::'''Wuyuan:''' Hah. Trying to act like you don't know me so you stand out more, is that it?
::'''Wuyuan:''' Hmph, like I haven't seen that one before! But I'm feeling nice today, so I'll play along with your little game.
::'''Wuyuan:''' My pen name is Wuyuan &mdash; yes, the author of Records of Jueyun, in the flesh!
::'''Wuyuan:''' I'm currently on a trip recording local myths and legends from all over Liyue.
::'''Wuyuan:''' So if you have an interesting story to share, let me know! And if it ends up in my book...
::'''Wuyuan:''' ...Maybe I gives the player a free signed copy as a thank-you!
::{{DIcon}} Do you have any interesting stories?
::'''Wuyuan:''' In truth, I've been on the trail of information concerning the [[Adepti#Guardian Yaksha|Guardian Yaksha]] lately, which may eventually feature in my "Records of Jueyun."
::'''Wuyuan:''' It's a pity, but there just isn't much to find right now except a few scattered, nondescript texts.
::'''Wuyuan:''' I've heard people say that they caught sight of an adeptus at Dihua Marsh, and I had a hunch that this might be the Guardian Yaksha...
::'''Wuyuan:''' But I reckon that I can just stay here and wait. After all, I am an author whose pen has been touched by the heavens themselves. Why, the material will come to me as a matter of course!
:{{DIcon}} What's Records of Jueyun?
::'''Wuyuan:''' Ai yai yai, I've never known a fan to keep up the stupid act for this long!
::'''Wuyuan:''' Records of Jueyun is the top-selling, critically acclaimed book series written by your truly. Even the [[Wanwen Bookhouse]] puts them in the most visible location in the store.
::'''Wuyuan:''' You'll find all sorts of Liyue myths and legends in this series.
::'''Wuyuan:''' Haw-haw, relax! Don't be nervous.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Was that really so scary?
:::'''Wuyuan:''' Oh, still pretending, are we?
:::'''Wuyuan:''' I see how it is. You're playing at not having read my book, hoping that I'll give you a signed copy, eh?
:::'''Wuyuan:''' No problem. If you really want one that much, here's a signed copy of "Records of Jueyun: Palace Beneath the Sea."
::;(Obtain [[Records of Jueyun]] - Vol. 2 (Palace Beneath the Sea) ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Maybe next time.
::'''Wuyuan:''' My new book will be out soon. Come find me and I'll give you a signed copy!
::'''Wuyuan:''' No need to thank me. I get people thanking me all the time.
