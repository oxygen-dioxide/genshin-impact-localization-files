==Gameplay Notes==
* The 100% effect increase at 100% Energy means that the effects of Increased Normal and Charged Attack are doubled, and not that the 100% is added onto them.
* Obtain the [[diagram]] as a reward for opening one of [[Takashi]]'s chests after giving him three [[Mysterious Conch]]es for seven days.

==Description==
"Get off the [["Seiraimaru"|ship]]. Women are a hindrance here!"<br>
The thief they called [[Ako Domeki]] turned and left.<br>
But hearing this, the [[Asase Hibiki|shrine maiden]] could not help by smile faintly.<br>
If [[Takamine the Mistsplitter|the person]] who had taught me archery had not gone forth to [[Cataclysm|campaign]] alongside the [[Makoto|Shogun]],<br>
Then our son would been the same age as [[Ako Domeki|Zaemon]] now.<br>
And perhaps I would have come to be a Takamine, or he, an Asase...

Zaemon's tone, and the way he intentionally turns his back on me,<br>
Is the spitting image of how he once did it, [[Mistsplitter Reforged|sword]] in hand.<br>
This time, I will not let this person die.<br>
Even if it means fighting against the Electro Mitsudomoe banner...

"Our [["The Catch"|fishing spears]] and swords have been sharpened. It is time to set sail."<br>
"Well then, let's show those Shogunate lackeys [[Seirai Island|Seirai]]'s strength!"

Hearing the sea shanties greeting their departure, the shrine maiden set down her warbow.<br>
She once secretly learned true "magic" on [[Mt. Yougou]],<br>
And though she felt sorry for her [[Reizenbou|Master]], the [[Tengu]], she would use it here.<br>
She would undo the [[The Warding Stones of Seirai|great barrier]] that had held for a thousand years,<ref group="TN•">The original Chinese text states {{zh|千年|rm=qiān nián}}, which literally means "a thousand years" but can also be used figuratively to mean "a very long time."</ref><br>
And she would set the [[Thunder Manifestation|resentment]] of the [[Thunderbird|moribund violet glede]] free,<br>
Allowing it to ravage the ships that flew the Electro Archon's banner.<br>
She could only hope that that [[Neko|old cat]] wouldn't come charging into the storm...

==Availability==
*[[Forging]]
**Its [[diagram]] is obtained from any of [[Takashi]]'s [[Mysterious Conch]] Chests on the 7th time the player opens one.

==Trivia==
*The weapon's name is a nod to the {{Lang|''{{w|hama yumi}}''|ja=破魔弓|ja_tl=evil-banishing bow}}, a sacred bow in Japanese mythology and religious rituals. Shrine maidens carried hama yumi and hama ya (evil-banishing arrows) as part of their religious regalia and have historically used it in battle or to protect their shrines.
*[[Yoimiya]] is seen wielding this bow in her [[Yoimiya/Media#Artwork|portrait art]], [[Yoimiya/Media#In-Game Assets|wish art]], [[Version 2.0]] trailer, [https://youtu.be/dn8etqEPtFg Character Demo], [https://youtu.be/b4QN9epy680 Collected Miscellany] and [[Genius Invokation TCG]] [[Yoimiya (Character Card)|Character Card]].
*[[Kujou Sara]] is seen wielding this bow in ''[[In the Name of the Resistance]]'', the [[Version 2.1]] trailer, [[:File:Icon Emoji Paimon's Paintings 09 Kujou Sara 1.png|one of her official stickers]], and [https://youtu.be/iXeJ94AFZDw Arataki Itto's Character Demo].
** She is instead seen with its ascended form in [[:File:Kujou Sara TPRGT 2023 - Lumine.png|one of her birthday event artworks]].
