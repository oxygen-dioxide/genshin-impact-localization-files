==Notes==
* The 100% effect increase at 100% Energy means that the effects of Increased Normal and Charged Attack are doubled, and not that the 100% is added onto them.

==Description==
"Get off the [["Seiraimaru"|ship]]. Women are a hindrance here!"<br />
The thief they called [[Ako Domeki]] turned and left.<br />
But hearing this, the [[Asase Hibiki|shrine maiden]] could not help by smile faintly.<br />
If [[Takamine the Mistsplitter|the person]] who had taught me archery had not gone forth to [[Cataclysm|campaign]] alongside the [[Makoto|Shogun]],<br />
Then our son would been the same age as [[Ako Domeki|Zaemon]] now.<br />
And perhaps I would have come to be a [[Takamine the Mistsplitter|Takamine]], or he, an [[Asase Hibiki|Asase]]...

[[Ako Domeki|Zaemon's]] tone, and the way he intentionally turns his back on me,<br />
Is the spitting image of how [[Takamine the Mistsplitter|he]] once did it, [[Mistsplitter Reforged|sword]] in hand.<br />
This time, I will not let [[Ako Domeki|this person]] die.<br />
Even if it means fighting against the [[Tri-Commission|Electro Mitsudomoe]] banner...

"Our [["The Catch"|fishing spears]] and swords have been sharpened. It is time to set sail."<br />
"Well then, let's show those Shogunate lackeys [[Seirai Island|Seirai]]'s strength!"

Hearing the sea shanties greeting their departure, the shrine maiden set down her [[Diagram: Hamayumi|warbow]].<br />
She once secretly learned true "magic" on [[Mt. Yougou]],<br />
And though she felt sorry for her Master, the [[Tengu]], she would use it here.<br />
She would undo the [[The Warding Stones of Seirai|great barrier]] that had held for a thousand years,<ref group="Note">The original Chinese text states {{lang|mini=1|zh=千年|zh_rm=qiān nián}}, which literally means "a thousand years" but can also be used figuratively to mean "a very long time."</ref><br />
And she would set the [[Thunder Manifestation|resentment]] of the [[Thunderbird|moribund violet glede]] free,<br />
Allowing it to ravage the ships that flew the Electro Archon's banner.<br />
She could only hope that that [[Neko|old cat]] wouldn't come charging into the [[Balethunder|storm]]...

*[[Forging]]
**Its [[diagram]] is obtained from any of [[Takashi]]'s [[Mysterious Conch]] Chests on the 7th time the player opens one.

==Trivia==
*The weapon's name is a nod to the {{Lang|{{w|hama yumi}}|ja={{Rubi|破|は|魔|ま|弓|ゆみ}}|ja_tl=evil-banishing bow}}, a sacred bow in Japanese mythology and religious rituals. Shrine maidens carried hama yumi and hama ya (evil-banishing arrows) as part of their religious regalia and have historically used it in battle or to protect their shrines.
*[[Yoimiya]] is seen wielding this bow in her portrait art, wish art, [[Version 2.0]] trailer, [https://youtu.be/dn8etqEPtFg Character Demo] and [https://youtu.be/b4QN9epy680 Collected Miscellany].
*[[Kujou Sara]] is seen wielding this bow in [[In the Name of the Resistance]], the [[Version 2.1]] trailer, [[:File:Icon_Emoji_Kujou_Sara_1.png|one of her official emojis]] and [[:File:Character Demo - "Arataki Itto- Make Way for the One and Oni!" - Genshin Impact|Arataki Itto's Character Demo trailer]].
