==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Thibert was a high-ranking member of a human supremacist conspiracy that disagreed with Iudex [[Neuvillette]] and his decision to allow the [[Melusine|Melusines]] to live in the [[Court of Fontaine]]. The conspiracy, known as the "old regime", sought to remove Neuvillette from power and take control of Fontaine's judiciary system.

Knowing he and his fellow conspirators stood no chance against the Iudex, Thibert instead chose to target Neuvillette and the Melusines' shaky reputation, by framing one of his closest confidantes for murder, [[Marechaussee Phantom]] member [[Carole]]. Thibert was the one who tricked Carole into entering the crime scene and planted the forged evidence used against her, while fellow conspirators [[Suavegothe]] and [[Clotaire]] incited panic among the Fontainians and led an angry mob that sought to force Neuvillette to admit allowing the Melusines to enter Fontaine was a mistake and depose him. Carole sacrificed her life to pacify the mob, to the [[Garde|Gardes]] and her partner [[Vautrin]]'s horror.

Devastated by his friend's death, Vautrin was consumed by rage and a desire for vengeance towards the old regime. With the help of his fellow Garde [[Rastignac]], he retrieved the list of suspected members of the conspiracy, hunted them down and killed them all.
