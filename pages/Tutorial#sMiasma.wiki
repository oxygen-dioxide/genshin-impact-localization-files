|text2    = Miasma may not be fatal to humans, but long-term exposure to it does affect wild animals and monsters, making them more violent than usual. The more powerful the monster, the more severe the effects.<br>Try defeating the {{Color|help|leader of the monsters}}, before following the trail to the {{Color|help|source of the miasma}} in the area and purifying it with adeptal energy.
