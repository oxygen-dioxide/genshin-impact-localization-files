'''Heart of Comradeship''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Resolution of Sojourner]].

==Description==
The traveler from a distant land pinned this flower close to his chest.

The traveler left a life of great privilege to pursue a wandering, unburdened life.<br />In a foreign land, by a clear lake of sweet waters, he met a frowning maiden.

"A traveler from afar? ...Huh. Not like it matters."<br />"You're a musician? Well then, pray do not insult me with empty praises or song."<br />"Just remember me as I am."<br />"As one about to be offered up as a sacrifice for the 'festival.'"

The traveler who had abandoned his homeland pinned this flower close to his chest.<br />He wished to remind himself to love no one, and become attached to nothing.<br />Yet he would remember that maiden as he had promised, and walk into the fire for her sake...
