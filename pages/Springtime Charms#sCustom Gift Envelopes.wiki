::'''Amber:''' Wow, a gift envelope! Thank you! I heard the people of Liyue exchange them during Lantern Rite as blessings.
::'''Amber:''' It's beautiful! I'll take good care of it.
::{{DIcon}} Are you here for the festival, specifically?
::'''Amber:''' Sure am! [[Jean]] said we worked really hard this year. She thinks we all deserve a break, so she set up a rotating calendar for us to take time off.
::'''Amber:''' [[Eula]] and I got our turn the last couple of days, so we came to Liyue Harbor as soon as we heard about the festivities.
::{{DIcon}} No lack of hustle and bustle &mdash; or fun things to do &mdash; on the streets, huh?
::'''Amber:''' Yep! We spent a lot of time roaming around the city. We just split up so we could go get souvenirs for everyone at the Knights of Favonius.
::'''Amber:''' I bought a ton of stuff! A fan for Jean, a teacup for [[Lisa]], a kite for [[Klee]]...
::'''Amber:''' Oh and, this is for you! [[Grilled Tiger Fish]] &mdash; it's super delicious. Here, try some! I just bought it, so it's still warm!
::'''Amber:''' Hurry, before it gets cold! I'm gonna keep shopping, okay?
::'''Amber:''' Fan, teacup, kite... What am I missing? Oh, right! Jewelry...

::{{DIcon}} I'm feeling just fine!
:::{{A|vo eqhdj005 9 baizhu 03b 1.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' That's good to hear. Standard medical texts offer little information on the treatment of fetor. I had to rely on ordinary methods.
::{{A|vo eqhdj005 9 baizhu 02a 2.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Your constitution is strong. You were covered in fetor, but your cardiovascular system remained unaffected.
::{{A|vo eqhdj005 9 baizhu 02a 3.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' The real miracle is the fact that you walked away from the array with no lasting damage... *cough* *cough*

::{{A|vo eqhdj005 9 baizhu 02a 4.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' *cough*... *cough*... Don't worry, it's just exhaustion &mdash; I stayed up all night writing prescriptions.
::'''Changsheng:''' *sigh* Which is exactly why you need a break. Relax, or your body will pay the price.
::{{A|vo eqhdj005 9 baizhu 02a 5.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Hehe, there's no need to worry. I know what I'm doing.
::{{A|vo eqhdj005 9 baizhu 02a 6.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Come find me if you begin to feel unwell. I can provide you with some restorative medicine.
::{{A|vo eqhdj005 9 baizhu 02a 7.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Never forget &mdash; even minor symptoms can be important warning signs.
::'''Changsheng:''' How about taking your own advice? Staying up all night &mdash; you need some restorative medicine of your own.
::{{A|vo eqhdj005 9 baizhu 02a 8.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' It's alright, Changsheng. I know what I'm doing.
:{{DIcon}} See you.

::{{DIcon}} I'm just glad that everyone is safe.
::'''Beidou:''' Haha, with your help, that's practically a guarantee!
::'''Beidou:''' I'm not the only one impressed by your feats. My crew is dying to have a drink with you.
::{{DIcon}} My tolerance isn't that high, I fear...
::'''Beidou:''' Don't worry &mdash; I already got 'em off your back.
::'''Beidou:''' You're fierce on the battlefield. But, when it comes to alcohol, my crew would drink you under the table.
::'''Beidou:''' Still, you should join us for a meal when you're free &mdash; I'll host.
::'''Beidou:''' In the meantime... I've gotta get back to the ship. I just received payment from the Tianquan, so it's time to divide it among the crew.
::'''Beidou:''' Once I do that, I'll start prepping our feast! I'll be in touch.
::'''Beidou:''' No backing out, you hear?

::{{DIcon}} D&mdash;Don't smile at me like that!
::'''Charlotte:''' Ah, thank you for this — it's beautiful. Now, onto the real business at hand.
::'''Charlotte:''' You know about the ritual Lady Tianquan conducted, right?
::'''Charlotte:''' I've asked around, and everyone says it's one of this land's traditional ceremonies. But, I also heard it hasn't been performed in a long time.
::'''Charlotte:''' Not to mention, as the ritual was starting, I saw a flock of birds scatter in the mountains near the harbor, and a strange light coming from the [[Wuwang Hill|forest]]...
::{{DIcon}} How did you see that?
::{{DIcon}} Did you walk over there?
::'''Charlotte:''' Ah, it's all thanks to my Kamera. I bought an ultra-telephoto lens not too long ago &mdash; definitely came in handy just now!
::'''Charlotte:''' Unfortunately, it was super dark, so the photos are too blurry to make out anything...
::'''Charlotte:''' That's why I was hoping you could fill me in, {{Traveler}}. Is there anything you can tell me? Doesn't have to be right now &mdash; you can write me a letter if you remember something...
::'''Charlotte:''' Here, take this. Think of it as... an advance.
::'''Charlotte:''' I'll treat you to a meal back in [[Fontaine]], too! How does that sound?

|Dear {{Traveler}},<br>I am not well-versed in the writing of gift envelopes, but [[Xianyun|Master]] told me that I need only offer the recipient my heartfelt blessings...<br>As I was reading a book that [[Xiangling]] lent me a few days back, I came across a few lines that I liked very much, so I copied them down to offer to you.<br>Winter wanes, and away drift the lanterns of Spring's inception, the land beneath bathed in a lush green hue.<br>How does one part with such tender sentiments? Fine as silk threads, boundless as the ocean waves.<br><br>I wish you a Happy Lantern Rite, {{Traveler}}.

|{{Character|Xianyun}}
|Most esteemed {{Traveler}},<br>That [[Shenhe|disciple]] of mine spent two whole nights outside gazing up at the moon, and all for the sake of writing a single gift envelope. When I urged her to drink some tea, she very nearly ended up drinking the ink before her instead. Honestly...<br>In any case, since she has written hers, I too shall write one for you.<br>Word of the tireless struggles and myriad hardships that fill your days has reached one's ears.<br>Yet the Lantern Rite has come around once more, so set aside your worldly burdens for a moment and soothe your spirit with a few idle cups of tea.<br>Should any dare to trouble you, come sit before the gate of one's mountain abode; then, we shall see who still has the audacity to disturb your repose.

Which is why this gift envelope is reaching you several days late. Anyway, in the coming year, I wish you success in all your endeavors and that everything goes as you desire.<br>I too have heard of your great deeds this Lantern Rite.
