'''Get Ready for the Road''' is a [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1303906054921547777 web event] that involves a 3 by 3 card setup. A user receives one chance to receive a prize from a random choose of the nine cards they're given. A user can sign up or log into their preexisting account to save these prizes until the official game's opening.

*Please note that all nine cards must be flipped over in order to activate the event.
*The prizes will be shelved before you can start transferring them for the actual redemption after September 28.
*The maximum limit for the luck score is 25.

==About the Inventory==
1. All prizes won in the card draw will be temporarily stored on your shelf. You will be able to select which prizes from the shelf to add as inventory items, and then convert into in-game items in ''Genshin Impact''.

2. Prizes of different classes have different load ratings. The maximum load of your inventory is 16. Consider which items will be of most use to you on your journey, and choose wisely!

3. Once items are added to the inventory and load requirements are met, you can select "Redeem Items." You may only redeem the prize items in your inventory once. After confirming your choice and redeeming your inventory items, you cannot reverse or change your decision. Please choose carefully and only confirm when you are happy with your choice.

4. After confirming which items to redeem, the system will check the status of your miHoYo Account. The system will confirm whether you have used your miHoYo Account in ''Genshin Impact'' to create a character and unlock the in-game message system. If you have not yet created a character in ''Genshin Impact'', you will be unable to redeem your items. If you have created a character and unlocked the in-game message system, you will be asked to confirm one final time. After confirming, the items will be delivered to you via in-game message in ''Genshin Impact''. Please be sure to check your messages and claim them. - ''Guidelines from [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/ys/event/e20200910-predrawcard-sea/index.html#/top Official Event Website]''.

*Load rating determines how much an item of certain rarity is worth. (i.e., [[Wanderer's Advice]] is worth 2. Having one of them would take up 2/16 of the maximum inventory space.)

==Tasks==
1. During the event period, you can receive additional tries each day for completing tasks. You may only receive up to 1 try (and therefore 1 prize) per task per day. - ''Guidelines from [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/ys/event/e20200910-predrawcard-sea/index.html#/top Official Event Website]''.

2. There are three categories of tasks:

*5 site-visiting tasks for up to 5 tries/day. Resets at the start of each day.

*1 sharing task for up to 1 try/day. Resets at the start of each day.

*1 one-off linking task for a total of 2 tries during the event period.

==Redeeming==
On the right-hand section, a user can preview the prizes in their inventory and move them for the actual redemption process. There is a maximum limit of 16. These prizes will be redeemable after the game's opening on September 28 until the end of the event.

==Luck System==
1. You will receive 1 luck point for every prize you win. The maximum luck score you can reach is 25.

2. When you reach a luck score of 25, you will "luck out." When you are lucked out, you are guaranteed to win a class A prize on your next try.

3. After you have won a class A prize while lucked out, the lucked out status will disappear and your luck score will be reset. You will then start accumulating luck points from zero once more.
