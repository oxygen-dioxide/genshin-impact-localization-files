==Trivia==
* The Chinese and Japanese versions use the term "Eight Gates." The name most likely comes from an important element of a traditional divination called {{w|Qimen Dunjia}} in China and Kimon Tonkou (also known as Hachimon Tonkou) in Japan.<section begin=halltrivia />
* In the English version, each department bears the title "Hall". It follows the original meaning of the Chinese word {{zh|s=厅|t=廳|rm=tīng|tl=hall" or "governmental office.}}<section end=halltrivia />
