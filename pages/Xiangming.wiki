:'''Xiangming:''' What is it? I'm on Millelith duty right now. Please keep your voice down...
:'''Xiangming:''' Also, please don't make any "shh" noises.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Xiangming:''' SHH! Keep your voice DOWN! If he hears us, he'll notice me!
::'''Xiangming:''' ...Ugh, now you've made me raise my voice too! Thanks a bunch...
::'''Xiangming:''' Look, I serve in the Millelith, and my job is to guard this bank. I've been watching that guy for a long time now &mdash; the one pacing around by the entrance.
::'''Xiangming:''' Funny thing is, he never withdraws any money. Never deposits any, either. He just hangs around there all day long, every time he comes here. I need to figure out what he's up to...
::'''Xiangming:''' That's why I've got to watch him like a hawk. In case he leaves a sign for the Treasure Hoarders, or something. It's just...
::{{DIcon}} It's just what?
::'''Xiangming:''' Why does he have to stand there all day long!
::'''Xiangming:''' I can hold out, but what I can't do is hold it in... I'm desperate for the toilet!
::'''Xiangming:''' Why, oh why won't he just go away...
::'''Xiangming:''' Ah... I'm reaching the point of no return...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Xiangming:''' Bye.
::'''Xiangming:''' ...I can't go AWOL from the Millelith just to relieve myself... I might find myself relieved of my duties by the time I get back...
