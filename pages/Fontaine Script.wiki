<section begin="Description" />The '''Fontainian script'''<ref name="Ipssissimus Log">Interactable, Tower of Ipsissimus: Bottom: [[Tower of Ipsissimus: Bottom#Investigation Log|Investigation Log]]</ref> refers to [[Fontaine]]'s current writing script. 

The script heavily resembles a more cursive-like [[Teyvat Script]] version, which is commonly found in various nations. This script is usually used to write english words and sentences, but unlike English, there appears to be no distinct letter case or punctuation.<section end="Description" />

The origins of this script are uncertain, but it was already in use during Fontaine's early nation-building stage<ref name="Ipssissimus Log" /> around 100 years after [[Remuria]]'s fall.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria}}</ref>
