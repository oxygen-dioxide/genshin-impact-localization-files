{{Description|Though the evil that lurked in the shadows of the night had been purged across thousands of years, a shadow that the light could not reach clouded human hearts.<br>Even now, the warning left by the Golden Hunter is etched into her memory: Those of the Night Vigil, carrying aloft lit candles against the blackness, have greater need still to remain vigilant. Be not corrupted by the cold dark.}}
'''Hunter's Vigil''' is [[Clorinde]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|Swift Hunt or Impale the Night|1}}
** This particle generation has a cooldown of '''2''' seconds, which is shared with the particle generation from Clorinde's [["From This Day, I Pass the Candle's Shadow-Veil"|1st]] and [["And So Shall I Never Despair"|6th]] Constellations.
* If Clorinde's [[Bond of Life]] is greater than or equal to 100%, the Elemental Skill icon for Impale the Night will emit a brief ripple effect.
