==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hung Fan:''' Two boxes of tea leaves, and a bunch of crates of jade items and other miscellaneous goods? Business is booming lately, heh...
:{{DIcon}} Are you a merchant?
::'''Hung Fan:''' You gotta be joking! I'm just a lowly laborer shifting goods who moonlights as a guard now and then.
::'''Hung Fan:''' Business and all that's way too complicated for me, ha! I'd rather work my body than work my brain.
::{{DIcon}} Hired guards can be part-timers?
::'''Hung Fan:''' *cough* Well, since I'm new to the biz, and I taught myself martial arts, I don't get a whole lotta commissions. Not like those pros from the [[Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency (Faction)|Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency]]...
::'''Hung Fan:''' So, I'm just doin' simple transport work for now, gonna save up some cash for maybe a few years.
::'''Hung Fan:''' Once I've got enough Mora in the bank, I'm gonna sign up for classes and study martial arts seriously, get myself real fists of fury and killer kung-fu kicks.
::'''Hung Fan:''' And then I'll go pro, and escort with the best! I won't even have to fear getting eaten by [[Xuanwen Beast]]s...
::{{DIcon}} Are Xuanwen Beasts that scary?
::'''Hung Fan:''' I've seem 'em with my own eyes! You may be a tough young {{MC|m=hero|f=heroine}}, but don't get cocky!
::'''Hung Fan:''' The things are practically invulnerable! I've seen my betters using real-deal [[Iron Point]]s against one...
::'''Hung Fan:''' They were ruthlessly trying to stick it, but it looked like it was enjoying being tickled.
::'''Hung Fan:''' If it were me, I wouldn't last half a second before I ended up as a Xuanwen snack!
::'''Hung Fan:''' If you run into one of those terrible monsters, I'd recommend just taking a detour!
:{{DIcon}} See you later.
::'''Hung Fan:''' See you, come talk to me again after I finish moving the tea leaves!
