{{Quest Description|You decide to announce the Zhiyi has passed the selection to make him lower his guard. Now all that's left to do is wait...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Wait until 09{{colon}}00 - 11{{colon}}00)
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|Yelan believes that while Zhiyi is a conscientious character, he may let his guard down if he thinks that he has won. As such, Yelan wants to announce that he has passed the assessment at Yuehai Pavilion...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Yuehai Pavilion)
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' It looks like we're all here. Well then, time for me to announce the results of the assessment process.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I won't drone on about the importance of the Tianshu role. Suffice to say that Uncle Tian entrusted me with the monumentally important task of assessing the candidates, and now it falls to me to give him a satisfactory answer.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 qianwei 01.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' All of us here know the score. Don't beat around the bush, just get on with it.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Qianwei has many pioneering ideas, but some of his plans are lacking in detail, and he easily gets into testy exchanges with other people.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Mingbo is reliable, but not quite ambitious enough, and because of his personality, he struggles to win people over.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' In contrast, Zhiyi is evenly balanced across the board, and enjoys an excellent reputation in Liyue.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' After much consideration, I have decided to recommend Zhiyi to the [[Liyue Qixing]].
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 qianwei 02.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' What!?
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 mingbo 01.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' Oh, uh... Congratulations...
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 zhiyi 01.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Thank you. Honestly, I'm a little surprised to hear my name being announced.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 zhiyi 02.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' In my estimation, all three of us are worthy candidates for the Tianshu position. As your competitor, I've become keenly aware of your great talents.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 zhiyi 03.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Would either of you entertain the possibility of working with me in the future, and taking on some of my workload?
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 qianwei 03.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' I'll have to see. I'm in a bad mood. This is the last thing I want to be thinking about right now.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 mingbo 02.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' I don't mind... As long as I can help...
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 07.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Okay, well that's all from me. Zhiyi, you'll have some preparation to do. It won't be long before you're informed of your official appointment. I hope you will work hard and make Uncle Tian proud.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 zhiyi 04.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' I will live up to the Tianshu name. On this, you have my word.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 zhiyi 05.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' I should go. I need to pack my things and then I think a celebratory meal is in order... Would anyone like to join me?
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 qianwei 04.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' Count me out. I am not in the mood for a celebration.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhiyi seems pretty relaxed now. This would be a good time to follow him...
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 qianwei 05.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' Hey, Traveler! Tell me something &mdash; what exactly does that guy have that I don't?
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 qianwei 06.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' If you can't answer that, I'm not accepting this result!
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 mingbo 03.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' I, uh... also wouldn't mind knowing...
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no! If we get stuck here, we won't be able to leave...
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 08.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Follow him.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 wenyuan 01.ogg}} '''Wenyuan:''' Yes, Ma'am.

:'''After finally persuading Qianwei and Mingbo to leave...'''

:{{A|vo yllq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... We finally got rid of them...
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 wenyuan 02.ogg}} '''Wenyuan:''' Lady Yelan, Zhiyi has gone towards Feiyun Slope.
:{{A|vo yllq003 2 yelan 09.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Follow him. Quickly.

:{{A|vo yllq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Zhiyi really sided with the Fatui?
:{{A|vo yllq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But [[Uncle Tian]] thought so highly of him. Why would he do this?
:{{A|vo yllq003 3 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Difficult to say. But everything should become a lot clearer when we find him.
----
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|You are breifly accosted by Qianwei and Mingbo, in which time Zhiyi has already departed from [[Yuehai Pavilion]]. Yelan has already sent people to follow him, so you'll be able to track him down together all the same.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Feiyun Slope)
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 shanghua 01.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' I'm sorry, Lady Yelan. We lost him.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 shanghua 02.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' He's too good at this... We weren't able to keep following him without being seen.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How the heck did he manage to shake Yelan's subordinates...
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' I guess Zhiyi didn't let his guard down. Still as vigilant as ever?
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 shanghua 03.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' No, Wupei says he's much more relaxed than usual... Maybe it's just how he's wired. Perceptive enough to sense when he's being watched.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But how...
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Don't blame yourselves. Let's not forget he was trained by Uncle Tian himself. Evading detection is not an unusual skill for him to have.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' If I'd asked you to tail Uncle Tian, you'd have ended up at a dead end, too. It's fine. So, where did you lose him?
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 shanghua 04.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' Xinyue Kiosk. He only went in briefly. Wupei and I were watching outside the whole time.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 shanghua 05.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' A few moments later, a man dressed in a completely different outfit came out. Wupei had a feeling that it was him, but we couldn't get close enough to check without blowing our cover.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 shanghua 06.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' I figured that if we spooked him, it would undo what we've accomplished today so far. Another option would've been to arrest him there and then... But without any evidence, that would've been meaningless.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 shanghua 07.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' So I stopped Wupei, and I stayed here to wait for you while that meathead went to ask around in Xinyue Kiosk.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Good work.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' The fish didn't take the bait, but that's okay. As long as he's still swimming around, we'll find a way to catch him eventually... The key is figuring out what he's trying to achieve.
:{{A|vo yllq003 4 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Let's go to Xinyue Kiosk.
----
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|The plan to follow Zhiyi didn't go as planned, but Yelan still seems confident.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Enter Xinyue Kiosk)
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 wupei 01.ogg}} '''Wupei:''' Could you explain to me how that works? A guy like him comes in, changes his whole outfit right under your nose, and you don't even ask him about it?
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 heli 01.ogg}} '''Heli:''' Our customers are free to dress however they please. What grounds would I have to question him?
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 wupei 02.ogg}} '''Wupei:''' *sigh* Okay, fair enough, but didn't you think it was just a little bit strange?
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 heli 02.ogg}} '''Heli:''' Maybe I did, but it still doesn't give me the right to stop him...
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Enough, let's tone this down a little.
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I'll make this quick. Just one question: What did he buy while he was here?
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 heli 03.ogg}} '''Heli:''' Oh, he didn't buy anything. He just picked up a bottle of liquor that he ordered ages ago.
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' A bottle of liquor?
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 heli 04.ogg}} '''Heli:''' Yes, a very strong kind. Fiery with a rich flavor. Not something the average customer would order.
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 heli 05.ogg}} '''Heli:''' This gentleman ordered it in person from us a long time ago. He was only here today to pick it up.
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Liquor... and wineware... I see. Let's go.
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where to?
:{{A|vo yllq003 5 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Xigu Antiques.
----
;(Talk to Linlang)
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Hey, Ms. Linlang, sorry to bother you &mdash; Zhiyi ordered a wineware set from you not long ago, right?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' We're friends of his. He's been telling us how impressed he is with the quality considering how affordable it was, so we just had to come and take a look for ourselves.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 linglang 01.ogg}} '''Linlang:''' Sure. Which model are you looking for?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Um... We don't really know a whole lot about wineware... Let's just go with Zhiyi's choice. Would you be able to show us the one he bought?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 linglang 02.ogg}} '''Linlang:''' Zhiyi picked up his set not long ago. As a quality imitation of an antique wineware set, it has the look and feel of a luxury item.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 linglang 03.ogg}} '''Linlang:''' Just so you're aware, we don't have many of this model left in stock. And now that Mr. Zhiyi has taken one, I'm afraid... it may encourage the price to go up a little.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Don't worry. Price shouldn't be an issue. I'm sure we can work something out. But I'm just a little hazy on one thing &mdash; did Zhiyi's wineware set include wine glasses, or...?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 linglang 04.ogg}} '''Linlang:''' For this set, the wine glasses are sold separately. Minimum purchase is one glass, maximum is four. Mr. Zhiyi bought two.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Okay... Thanks, Linlang. Seems there's a little more to buying wineware than I first thought. We'll have to mull it over.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 linglang 05.ogg}} '''Linlang:''' Well, don't take too long. We could sell out any day now... Alright, see you next time.

:'''You find a quiet place nearby...'''

:{{A|vo yllq003 6 wenyuan 01.ogg}} '''Wenyuan:''' This is turning into a real headache...
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 shanghua 01.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' I'd just like to point out that we have the self-professed "Grandmaster of Fieldwork" here to thank for being wholly incapable of tailing an ordinary civilian without being seen.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 wupei 01.ogg}} '''Wupei:''' It's not like you did any better!
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 shanghua 02.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' My specialty is information trading, okay? I don't have the physical agility. What's your excuse?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 wupei 02.ogg}} '''Wupei:''' I... ugh... fair point.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yelan, so has the plan failed?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we can't figure out where Zhiyi went, there's not much we can do... But why was he buying liquor at Xinyue Kiosk anyway? To celebrate?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' If so, it's no ordinary celebration.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you mean?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 07.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' First of all, Zhiyi isn't much of a drinker. On some level, he hates alcohol because of what it did to his father.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 08.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' If he was just looking to celebrate by himself, he wouldn't spend his meager savings on an expensive bottle of alcohol, let alone buy a pair of special wine glasses.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 09.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' No, this is a victory feast... held in honor of Zhiyi's private sponsor.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 10.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Whoever this person is clearly enjoys hard liquor and has a very high status &mdash; hence the need for expensive-looking wineware.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 11.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Now, where might we find Fatui who match that description, I wonder?
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 wenyuan 02.ogg}} '''Wenyuan:''' Fatui officials? Should be either the [[Snezhnayan Embassy]] or the [[Northland Bank]].
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 12.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Have both locations surrounded. Take as many people as you need.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 wupei 03.ogg}} '''Wupei:''' Lady Yelan, is it time for us to make our move? If so, you can count me in.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 13.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Get with the program, would you? This is a covert surveillance operation. Zhiyi may be vigilant, but that doesn't mean the same is true for his drinking buddy.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 14.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' In which case, we don't need to change tactics, just change who we're following.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great idea! So we just need to find out who Zhiyi bought that liquor for and follow them instead!
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 wenyuan 03.ogg}} '''Wenyuan:''' But Lady Yelan, if we get caught, this could become a major diplomatic incident...
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 15.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I'm well aware. But don't you see? Zhiyi is gambling everything on this. If we really want to catch him, we're going to have to accept a little risk ourselves.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 16.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Stick to your orders. And make sure we're covering all other bases, too &mdash; anywhere else Zhiyi might be going, I want eyes on those locations.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 wenyuan 04.ogg}} '''Wenyuan:''' ...Yes, Ma'am.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 shanghua 03.ogg}} '''Shanghua:''' Don't worry, Lady Yelan. Zhiyi may be a slippery character, but we'll keep a close watch on the movements of all Fatui officials.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 17.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I'll be waiting for you at the teahouse.
:{{A|vo yllq003 6 yelan 18.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' If I'm guessing correctly, Fatui officials are likely to take action at night. (Traveler), you should go and get ready, then meet me at [[Yanshang Teahouse]].

{{Quest Description|update|Yelan judges that Zhiyi will meet a Fatui contact at night. Till then, you can only wait.}}

;(Wait until the appropriate time)
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|Night has come. Time to go and ask Yelan if she has obtained any information about the Fatui.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Yanshang Teahouse)
:{{A|vo yllq003 8 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Perfect timing. Wenyuan just sent word that the Fatui Ambassador, [[Yusupov]], just left the embassy alone. He's heading in the direction of [[Qingxu Pool]].
:{{A|vo yllq003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Qingxu Pool? That's the place Zhiyi mentioned in his manifesto...
:{{A|vo yllq003 8 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' It looks like that's where they've arranged to meet. Sensible choice, I'll give them that.
:{{A|vo yllq003 8 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Qingxu Pool is always crawling with monsters. Most people wouldn't dream of going there. It's one place they won't need to worry about being seen.
:{{A|vo yllq003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no! We gotta go get them!
:{{A|vo yllq003 8 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Let's go. If my hunch is correct, we just might hit the jackpot this time.
----
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|Yelan mentions that a Fatui ambassador, Yusupov, has left the embassy today and headed to Qingxu Pool. Time to track him down.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Qingxu Pool)
:{{A|vo yllq003 9 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' This is Qingxu Pool. Full of ruins, crawling with monsters... Anyone with any sense steers well clear of this place.
:{{A|vo yllq003 9 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I've looked into the place before. There's a workers' entrance somewhere around here &mdash; follow me.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo yllq003 10 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' There's been some work done on this place in the past, but it's a bit of a labyrinth inside. I can't guarantee we'll be safe once we're underground.
:{{A|vo yllq003 10 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' The workers left an emergency access route. If we can find it, this will be a much easier journey.
:{{A|vo yllq003 10 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Still... Be ready to fight at any moment. Any resistance needs to be taken out quickly and quietly. We don't want to attract too much attention.
:{{A|vo yllq003 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we're all professionals here!
:{{A|vo yllq003 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, Yelan, where are your three little helpers at?
:{{A|vo yllq003 10 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' They have other things to take care of first. We couldn't afford to wait for them, but they'll join us later.
----
;(Enter the domain)
;(Defeat the first set of enemies)
:{{A|vo yllq003 13 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' As I expected. But this shouldn't be too much trouble.

;(Enter the second room)
:{{A|vo yllq003 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You guys see that? That's gotta be the Fatui Ambassador, here to meet Zhiyi... Looks like he went through that door!
:{{A|vo yllq003 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That must be the emergency access route, right? Come on, let's hurry!

;(Interact with the gate)
:{{A|vo yllq003 13 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' This is the construction workers' emergency access route... but it's closed tight.
:{{A|vo yllq003 15 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Trying to break through would be risky. Let's see if we can find another way.

;(After activating both lamps)
:{{A|vo yllq003 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The water's gone down... Hey, look, is that another way through?

;(After activating the next set of lamps)
:{{A|vo yllq003 17 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' The water's flowed into the groove and now the statues have lit up. Okay, now we should be able to move the statues.

;(After placing the statues in the correct spots)
:{{A|vo yllq003 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The door is open, let's go!

;(Go through the door)
:{{A|vo yllq003 18 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' We should be nearly at the bottom now... Let's wrap this up.

----
;(Listen to the conversation)
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 01.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Mmm... I can tell from the aroma that this is very fine liquor indeed. I'm impressed.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 02.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Come on, bottoms up. After you, of course!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 01.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' *coughing* ...Sorry, that went down the wrong way. I've never drunk anything this strong before. It'll take me some getting used to.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 03.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' You'll get there. If you want to stay friends with us, you have to drink with us.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 02.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' *cough* ...I'll do my best.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 04.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' You're more of a lightweight than I thought... Already struggling after one glass?
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 05.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' I thought you were made of sterner stuff. You certainly kept it together when you were poisoning your teacher's soup!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 06.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Come on, another round. Less talking, more drinking, haha!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 03.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Sure. You didn't leave me much of a choice, though, did you? Just the mention of poisoning sends shivers down my spine.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 04.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' I'm more timid than you realize. Every time I poisoned him, I had to hide away at home for a few days because I was so scared of getting caught.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 07.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Look, I know it has not been easy for you, my friend. We appreciate all your hard work.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 08.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' But I have to say: You really are quite a genius at poisoning people.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 09.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' I mean, the poison we brought from Snezhnaya is as strong as this wine, but you found a way to turn it into an imperceptible, slow-acting poison and came up with the idea of delivering it through fish soup.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 10.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' What was it you said... Oh yeah. You said "the soup's fishy flavor neutralizes the pungency of the poison, and this process even makes the soup tastier as a result"... Tsk tsk, how did you think of that?
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 05.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' It struck me one day when I was fishing. I'm lucky it did, otherwise, I'm not sure I would have been able to fool Uncle Tian.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 11.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' You have performed excellently! The Fatui will continue to provide the support you need to consolidate your position as Tianshu. Of course, this is as long as you continue to do as we instruct.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 12.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Aside from Qingxu Pool, we also have some other requests for you, which we will inform you of in due course.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 06.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Don't worry. Whatever tasks you have for me, I will perform them diligently.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you hear that? It was poison... That's why Uncle Tian hasn't been feeling well recently. It's all Zhiyi's doing!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a nasty guy! Seize him!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Hold on. Did you bring a Kamera, (Traveler)?
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' If not, you can use mine. This is quite a scene. We have to capture it for posterity.

:'''You take a picture of Zhiyi drinking with Yusupov...'''

:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 13.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Ahhh... Excellent liquor!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 14.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' We've seen no progress on the diplomatic front, and everyone has been eyeing up the treasure of Qingxu Pool. It's been a real headache for me.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 15.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' But soon, everything will be taken care of, and I can report back on a successful mission. Thank you, Zhiyi!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 16.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' I remember when I first saw you... I knew right away that you would make a good partner for us. Hey, do you still remember what I said to you?
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 07.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' How could I forget. You said a lowly commoner like me could never be seen as a serious candidate for the Tianshu, no matter how hard I work.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 08.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' "The only way is for you to shine bright in the Tianshu's darkest moment"... I think you were absolutely right.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 17.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Yes. Under normal circumstances, the gap between you and other people could only ever grow wider over time.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 18.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Just look at your two competitors. Qianwei had wealth, Mingbo had reputation, but you? You had nothing. You were just another nobody!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 19.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' ...And that's why I decided to help you. Yeah, there is an old saying in the Fatui: Give a starving dog a bone, and it'll guard your home for the rest of its life.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 09.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Yes, I cannot thank you enough for your generous support.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 20.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Hahaha... You know, the best thing about you is that you do as you're told, without complaining. Keep up the good work, and I can assure you, you'll never have to worry about Mora again.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 21.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Heck, when you're not in the company of the Fatui, you'll be able to throw your weight around as much as you want. How about that?
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Uncle Gao said that Zhiyi has low self-esteem... Seems he was right.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' He was worried that whatever advantage he might have now will diminish over time... so the Fatui persuaded him that he should act while he can.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Do you have any more film in the Kamera?
:{{DIcon}} Plenty.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Then get ready to use it. Tonight's grand finale should be coming up any minute now.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yelan 07.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' How well this goes for us depends on how Zhiyi plays his hand.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 22.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Is there any more alcohol? Go on, fill me up. I'm in a good mood today, and I'm gonna drink my fill. Make sure to get me home safely afterward.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 10.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' There's only a little left. Here, I'll fill your glass. If you like it, I can bring you some more next time.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 23.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' *gulp* ...Phwoar, this is the good stuff, it is great...
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 24.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Huh? Ugh... *cough* ... *cough* ...What the...

:'''Suddenly, the Fatui official seems to be in pain and slowly drops to the ground.'''

:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 25.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Zhiyi... You... You poisoned my wine? But when...
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 11.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' You seem surprised, Mr. Yusupov?
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 26.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' You... How could you...
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 12.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' How could I not? I've sacrificed years of my life studying and reflecting to prepare myself for this position, and in the end I even had to poison my own teacher.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 13.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' You really think I'd put myself through all that just to become your little puppet? I don't want to bow down to anyone ever again, and that includes you.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 27.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' You imbecile! It's the Fatui who got you to where you are, do you understand? ...If I disappear with no explanation, the embassy will come after you... They'll get to the bottom of this, mark my words!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 14.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Do you see the haystack in the corner? Underneath it is a pile of explosives. And next door in the darkroom are the three undercover agents you sent to infiltrate the Blackcliff Forge.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 15.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' I'm gonna stay here till I see you slip into unconsciousness, then I'm gonna set this on fire. Once the flames burn through the hay, they'll ignite the explosives, the ruins will collapse, and everything will be buried.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 28.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Wh&mdash;What do you hope to...
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 16.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' I took the liberty of leaving some evidence of your contact with the undercover agents at the Blackcliff Forge. It won't take long for people to join the dots... Two missing-person cases will become one as the "truth" gradually reveals itself.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 17.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' The Fatui planted undercover agents in the Blackcliff Forge to steal their signature ruin-grade explosives. Their plan was to blow through the solid floor tiles in the dead of night and seize the treasure of Qingxu Pool.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 18.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' *sigh*...But things didn't quite go to plan. Mistakes were made that led to the accidental deaths of the entire crew.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 19.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Faced with the overwhelming evidence, the embassy won't investigate this any further. In fact, they'll be only too happy to blame it all on a rogue operation by you.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 20.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' It explains why you acted alone, while exonerating the rest of the embassy of any liability.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 21.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Of course, none of that will have anything to do with me. When all of this comes to my attention, I'm afraid I'll have no choice but to cancel the Qingxu Pool Redevelopment Plan immediately. I guess then, I'll be Tianshu in my own right, with a clean record and well out of the Fatui's reach.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 29.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Haha... Hah.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 30.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' Zhiyi, do you really think you're gonna get away with this? The Fatui has a record of everything! That includes the poison, all interactions between us, even my trip here tonight!
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 31.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' After I die... they'll come looking... and they'll get to the bottom of this...
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 22.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' A record? Oh, you must mean the one in the hands of your second-in-command, [[Theofan]]?
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 32.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' H&mdash;How do you know about that?
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 23.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Because when you contacted me, I also made contact with your associates. I have Theofan to thank for providing me with the poison I used on you today.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 24.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' He'll help me tie up all the loose ends. After all, your untimely demise comes with a few perks for him.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 25.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' He has been eyeing your position for a long time now.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 yusupov 33.ogg}} '''Yusupov:''' That traitor! *cough* ... *cough* ...Zhiyi, you&mdash;
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 26.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Shhh. Relax... It's over. After tonight, everyone gets what they want. And anyone else in the know is either my accomplice, or about to be taken out of the picture.
:{{A|vo yllq003 19 zhiyi 27.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Sweet dreams, Mr. Yusupov.

;(Talk to Yelan)
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I did a little surveying on the way here, and found that you'd left yourself three escape routes in case things went south.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I have them all surrounded. If you're thinking of trying anything, save yourself the effort. The game's up.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' We were here the whole time and have pictures of everything. They came out pretty nicely, wanna see them?
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 01.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' "The game's up"? ...Forgive me, I'm not quite sure what you're referring to, Ms. Yelan?
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 02.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' I happened to discover a Fatui operation here, so I approached them on the pretext of joining forces and eventually brought them down from within. If it pleases you, Ms. Yelan, I'd be only too happy to have you join me in investigating this matter.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' This is how you want to play it, huh?
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Fine, you do you. All we need to do to convict you is establish that the poison in his system is the same as in Uncle Tian's.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 03.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' ...
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Nothing else you wanted to add? Let's leave it there then. Time to go.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 04.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' One wrong move and it all comes crashing down... I should have been more careful.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 05.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' You followed him here, didn't you? I was so focused on keeping myself out of sight, I forgot he was a potential liability.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 06.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' Let's talk about this, Yelan. I gave you my word that I would live up to the Tianshu name, and that much I can still guarantee.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 07.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Your point being?
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 07.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' When I take office, I can guarantee that I will act in your best interests. In fact, all of you here tonight can expect very generous treatment in the future.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 08.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' I don't deny that I used underhanded methods to get here. But given my lowly origins, what other choice did I have?
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 08.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Hmph, you still don't get it, do you? Even now.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 09.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' What do you think, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} What will Uncle Tian think?
:{{DIcon}} Uncle Tian has always trusted you.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 10.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Exactly. Zhiyi, clever people can always come up with a good excuse. But while you might be able to get other people to believe you, you'll never be able to deceive yourself.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 11.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' There's nothing wrong with wanting to win other people's respect. But when has Uncle Tian ever looked down on you?
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 12.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' He was like a teacher and a father to you, but you chose to repay that by poisoning him... Whatever positive goal you may have started out with, you threw it away in that moment.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 09.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' That's enough... I...
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 13.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Of course, what makes this even crueler is that you managed to convince yourself there was "no other way." Uncle Tian was always going to give you this opportunity... even if you'd done nothing at all.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 yelan 14.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Out of everyone in the world, he is the one who trusts you the most. So much that he drank your fish soup without doubting you, not for one second.
:{{A|vo yllq003 21 zhiyi 10.ogg}} '''Zhiyi:''' That's enough! ...That's enough.
{{Cutscene Description|Zhiyi remembers the lessons that Uncle Tian taught him once while they were fishing together, and the hesitation he felt when poisoning the latter, and is wracked with internal turmoil... which Yelan interrupts.

:{{A|vo yllq003 24 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' You needn't worry too much. Keep taking the prescribed medicine, every day, and a full recovery will take at most two to three years.

:{{DIcon}} Are you feeling any better?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 03.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Yes. The exhaustion seems to have gone, and my mind is steadily getting clearer again.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Luckily, it looks like choosing the Tianshu's successor is suddenly not such a pressing issue after all.

:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' My work is mostly wrapped up, so I thought I'd take a minute to check in here.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' The assessment process comes to an end here, Uncle Tian. In my opinion, Zhiyi is not suitable for the position. But Qianwei and Mingbo both have potential.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 04.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' You have my gratitude.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 05.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' *sigh* ...People can change their loyalties easily, I've always known this. But whenever it happens, it's still a dismal experience.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or... is Uncle Tian not that surprised?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Hehe, don't underestimate Uncle Tian. He wouldn't have appointed me as assessment officer if he hadn't had his doubts about Zhiyi.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Normally, the Yuehai Pavilion would be responsible for assessing the candidates. Isn't that right, Uncle Tian?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 06.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Yes. To be quite honest, I wanted to trust him unreservedly, but I have to be responsible with the position of Tianshu.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 07.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' When I first met Zhiyi, I wondered if he had approached me with a hidden agenda, so I secretly investigated him.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 08.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' I concluded that he had no ulterior motives whatsoever. He just saw me as an ordinary fishing friend.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 09.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' In the end, even he changed... but when did it start?
:{{DIcon}} What if none of this had ever happened?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 10.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' I never had any plans to recommend him directly, but I always intended to give him the chance to compete on a level playing field. Family background and fame mean everything to many people, but I don't attach great importance to them.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 11.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' I had no reputation to speak of when I first became Tianshu. I relied on [[Ganyu]]'s assistance for all manner of things. What I really admired about Zhiyi was his intelligence and resilience.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I have to admit, he's a smart guy, and very cautious.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 07.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' The intel suggests that the Fatui saw him as very low risk, but Zhiyi was still extremely careful with the poisoning.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 08.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' He chose that specific liquor from [[Xinyue Kiosk]] because the fiery flavor would mask the bitterness of the poison, and he chose to wait until the Fatui official was drunk and had his guard down before delivering it to him.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 09.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' He also installed a secret compartment in the wine pot he bought to hold the poison. As the amount of liquor went down, he'd shake the pot to release the poison from the compartment into the liquor.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 10.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Afterwards, we also found he had an antidote on him. Had the Fatui official grown suspicious, Zhiyi would have drunk the poisoned wine himself, and then found an opportunity to take the antidote shortly afterwards.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But that's still really dangerous...
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 11.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Yes, had he drunk the poisonous wine, he still would've faced serious health consequences despite taking the antidote. He didn't hesitate to put himself in harm's way to achieve his goal.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 12.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' How is Zhiyi now?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 12.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Well, I mean, he's sitting in a jail cell. Like [[Yanfei]] says, everyone who breaks the law has to pay the price.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 13.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Still, he's cooperating. He didn't turn down my offer to strike a deal. I'll make sure there are plenty of guards around to keep him safe from anything the Fatui might be planning.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A deal? Does this have to do with what you said to him when you arrested him?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 14.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Yes. Zhiyi's not the one I'm interested in. If he was as far as this went, I'd have handed the case off to my subordinates as soon as I realized.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 15.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' But once the Fatui became involved, things got a whole lot more interesting... I thought I might have the chance to catch a big fish.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 13.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Well, did you?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 16.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Almost. Unfortunately, it slipped off the hook at the last second.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uncle Tian, Yelan, what are you talking about? Paimon doesn't understand...
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 17.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Zhiyi colluded with the Fatui to try and secure the position of Tianshu. Or, to put it the other way around, the Fatui made an attempt to interfere in the Tianshu selection process.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 18.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' With Yusupov in our hands and a statement from Zhiyi, we could afford to continue with a diplomatic offensive.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 19.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Also, we'd be able to gain control of Theofan, Yusupov's second-in-command. Then we'd have a pawn in the ranks of the Fatui.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 20.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Pawns like this can be major assets. They open up all sorts of new options.
:{{DIcon}} So this was your real plan?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 21.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Why else did you think I was investing so much time and effort into this case?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, okay, well... Did your plan succeed?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 22.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' We got halfway. The first part went off without a hitch, and we passed all the information on to Lady Ningguang.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 23.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' But when we tried to make contact with Theofan, he was gone... along with all the evidence.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 14.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' The Fatui must be spying on us. Otherwise, they'd never have been able to respond so quickly.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 24.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I found out from other sources that the Harbinger "[[Regrator]]" got involved.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 25.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' The Fatui's main forces aren't concentrated here. Regrator was only treating this as a peripheral concern.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 26.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' It's a pity that Theofan got away. But knowing which Harbingers are still looking at Liyue is something. It gives me a starting point for my next mission.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 15.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' I have to ask, Yelan, do you have any desire to take over the position of Tianshu yourself?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 16.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' I remember you showed some interest a few days ago at Yanshang Teahouse. In my estimation, you are more than competent.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 27.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Oh that... I was obviously joking.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 28.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I prefer my current life. There's danger and there's excitement.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 29.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Although it'd still be a behind-the-scenes role, as Tianshu, I wouldn't have the chance to get involved in anything truly clandestine or face any real danger.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 30.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Alright, I'm done here, time for me to go. I'm heading off again in a few days, and I still have to prepare.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where are you off to this time?
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 31.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' As you might have guessed... Heh, it's for me to know, and you to find out.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 32.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' But I'm sure if you keep going as you are, getting yourselves involved in other people's business all the time, you're sure to get caught up in another misadventure before too long.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 33.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Maybe I'll see you the next time danger beckons. Until then, keep your wits about you... A lot of people are watching you for a lot of reasons.
:{{A|vo yllq003 24 yelan 34.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' If you have any more questions, just ask Uncle Tian. After the recent turn of events... I'd say he owes you one, wouldn't you?
;(Quest ends)
----
;(Talk to Uncle Tian again)
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 uncletian 01.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' What would you like to know?
:{{DIcon}} About Zhiyi...
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17a 1.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Something I've said to Zhiyi, Qianwei, and Mingbo before is that while cunning and scheming are quite crucial, even more important than this is staying true to yourself.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17a 2.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Zhiyi and Ambassador Yusupov each saw the other as a means to an end. They thought that if they could just outsmart their opponent, they would emerge the final victor. And yet, in the eyes of Yelan and "Regrator," they are but pawns in a much bigger game.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17a 3.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Scheming is an endless endeavor. If you can't cope with it, you're better off staying out of it. It gives you a much clearer view, in any case.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17a 4.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Everyone has self-interest, but you cannot let it be your master. So don't fight over fleeting gains and losses. Rather, focus on the direction your heart is leading you, and keep moving forward.
:{{DIcon}} About Yelan...
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17b 1.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' I first met Yelan when she was very young. Even back then, she was extremely tough, and she kept her cards close to her chest.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17b 2.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' An old friend of mine once privately commented to me that Yelan "is always smiling, but never with her eyes. She is a very dangerous person."
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17b 3.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Something of an exaggeration, in my view. At least, I know she would never hurt the people she trusts.
:{{DIcon}} About "Regrator"...
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17c 1.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' "Regrator" is the 9th of the Fatui Harbingers, though likely the first among them where wealth is concerned.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17c 2.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' However, his "wealth" is not a mere question of how much Mora he has to his name. He has a very unique understanding of wealth... And what he's planning may very well shake the world to its core.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17c 3.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Beyond that, I don't have a lot of information about him. If you need to know more in the future, you can ask Ningguang.
:{{DIcon}} About the next Tianshu...
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17d 1.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' As Yelan says, now that I'm on the mend, I should have another few years' worth of work in me.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17d 2.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' During this time, I plan to gradually hand over my duties while mentoring some new candidates.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17d 3.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Ah, that reminds me. Qianwei and Mingbo are still waiting downstairs. I must go and have a chat with them shortly.
:{{DIcon}} I have no more questions.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17e 1.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Thanks to you and Yelan, everything turned out okay this time.
::{{A|vo yllq003 24 uncletian 17e 2.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' You can always find me at the wharf if there's ever something else you'd like to discuss in the future.

;(Talk to Mingbo and Qianwei near Yanshang Teahouse)
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 mingbo 01.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' So, Zhiyi... is already in prison, I guess?
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 qianwei 01.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' You think? He poisoned Uncle Tian... I still can't believe he'd do that.
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 mingbo 02.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' *sigh* ...
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 qianwei 02.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' Why the long face?
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 mingbo 03.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' Nothing... I just... I think it's a great shame.
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 mingbo 04.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' I always thought... he's very smart. If he became Tianshu... he'd be able to accomplish many things I could never hope to.
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 qianwei 03.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' Don't feel bad. I'll admit that he was a strong contender, but give me three years and I'll overtake him.
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 qianwei 04.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' When I become Tianshu, I'll make you my deputy. Like the sound of that?
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 mingbo 05.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' Start by working on your temperamental issues... If you can't keep your cool, your work will suffer.
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 mingbo 06.ogg}} '''Mingbo:''' Right now... you still have a long way to go before you'll be eligible to take the Tianshu position.
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 qianwei 05.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' I'll get there. One step at a time. And then, before you know it, there'll come a day when you won't be able to find a single flaw in me or my work.
:{{A|vo dialog yllq003 qianwei 06.ogg}} '''Qianwei:''' First things first, though... Let's go and talk to Uncle Tian.
