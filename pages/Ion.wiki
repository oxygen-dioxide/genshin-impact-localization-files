{{Quote|Here lies Ion no Mikoto, versed in fortune-telling and sigil-signs, but who often predicted falsely, never errant only when reading the span of his own years.|The Royal Tomb of Ion}}

Though his tombstone says otherwise, Ion claims that he has never missed a read on someone's fortune. Instead, he will deliberately tell those who do not have happy fates that their luck will turn, in the hopes they will have a happier time. He does admit that generally his readings are not exactly correct, but it is unusual for him to fail to get a reading at all - thus his inability to read [[Paimon]]'s fortune he considers a challenge to further his studies.<ref name="hide and seek">{{Ref/HEO|Sunchildren Hide and Seek}}</ref>
