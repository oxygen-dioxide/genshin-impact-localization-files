==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Su Er'niang:''' There's nothing better than piping hot Zhongyuan Chop Suey!
:'''Su Er'niang:''' There's only one fool who would ever say otherwise!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy a snack.
::'''Su Er'niang:''' Sure thing, we've got hot chop suey fresh from the oven!
:;(Opens shop)
:{{DIcon}} Chop suey...?
::'''Su Er'niang:''' I know, I know, the name sounds a little odd.
::'''Su Er'niang:''' But Zhongyuan Chop Suey is a local specialty here in Chihu Rock.
::'''Su Er'niang:''' It all starts with rinsed giblets that's chopped into mince meat. Then you add some Tiger Fish gelatin along with some starch and other ingredients, and roll it into meatballs.
::'''Su Er'niang:''' After a quick deep fry, they're ready to be enjoyed. Not a hint of fish in that wonderful aroma!
::'''Su Er'niang:''' But it sure is troublesome having to explain the name to every outlander that shows up to eat here, whew!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} ...Giblets?
:::'''Su Er'niang:''' There's nothing to worry about, everything's washed thoroughly before I use it.
:::'''Su Er'niang:''' I have some customers who never used to go near any kind of animal innards, but after they'd tried it here they simply fell in love with it!
:::'''Su Er'niang:''' Go on, have a taste! Free of charge. If you like it, please come back and buy some more!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Zhongyuan Chop Suey|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Who's the fool that disagrees?
::'''Su Er'niang:''' Why, that manager of the warehouse, [[Gou San'er]]. Who else!?
::'''Su Er'niang:''' After working all morning to prepare the food, I saw him looking after the warehouse all by himself. He looked quite tired, so I offered him some...
::'''Su Er'niang:''' Once he was finished, I asked him if he liked it. He said that he would have preferred something saltier and spicier!
::'''Su Er'niang:''' Some nerve he has talking like that! And to think that I was kind enough to offer him some!
::'''Su Er'niang:''' You see? I get all worked up just thinking about it. I'll be sure teach him a thing or two about good cooking!<!--in game typo-->
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Su Er'niang:''' Bring some of your friends along next time and I might even give you a discount!
