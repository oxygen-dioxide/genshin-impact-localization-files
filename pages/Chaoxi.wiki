==Profile==
Chaoxi is a sailor and a playboy who has begun &mdash; and abandoned &mdash; romantic relationships with multiple women across [[Teyvat]], and is currently going between [[Cui'er]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Ocean Pearl}}</ref> and [[Sisi]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sisi|s=Daytime}}</ref> He is also likely the "heartless sailor" from Liyue who once broke [[Taraneh]]'s heart by cheating on her, leading her to dream of someday taking revenge on him.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Taraneh}}</ref> Another woman leaves a message on the [[Yilong Wharf Bulletin Board]], who prays to [[Fujin]] for Chaoxi's protection and to "bring him back home."<ref>{{Ref/BB|Yilong Wharf Bulletin Board|Fengtai Advertisement}}</ref>

Sisi's infatuation with Chaoxi caught [[Chang the Ninth]]'s attention in the past. While conducting research for a "gushy romance" in the {{Quest|A Novel Idea}}, Chang can send the [[Traveler]] to covertly listen in on their conversation and report it back to him. After they do so, Chang judges that "Something's not right with this Chaoxi chap... Wait, no, I take it back. Something's wrong with both of them," and predicts that the Millelith are likely going to end up "picking up the pieces" of their relationship.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sisi:''' Chaoxi, you've finally returned! Let's settle our engagement plans while you're back this time, what do you say?
:'''Chaoxi:''' Sisi, I literally just got back from sea and I'm completely drained, mentally and physically. Let's talk about it later...
:'''Sisi:''' But that's what you said last time, and before I knew it you were running off with some other girl...
:'''Chaoxi:''' Come now, don't be that way. We're just friends, nothing more.
:'''Sisi:''' If you two are just friends, then what are you so worried about? Why can't we get engaged?
:'''Chaoxi:''' There you go again! I don't have any intention of getting married yet. It's not that I can't shoulder the responsibility, Sisi, it's just that I don't want to disappoint you, that's all.
:'''Chaoxi:''' I'm a sailor and the sea is always calling me, there's no escaping it. You might as well just consider me swallowed by the waves already. You deserve someone better.
:'''Sisi:''' Don't talk like that Chaoxi. I know that you'll be just fine...
