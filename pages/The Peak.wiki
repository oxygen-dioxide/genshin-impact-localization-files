|name_5      = Stomp
|desc_5      = Stomps a small area in front of it, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. This stomp is telegraphed. This also generates four Dracolite Shards. While the Dracolite Shards are present, the Local Legend horns will be ignited.

Afterwards, generates three large Dracolite Shards while charging up, indicated with a telegraphed circle. When charging completes, destroys the Dracolite Shards and slams the ground, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. The Dracolite Shards are {{Pyro}} objects and can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reaction]]s, but their durability will reduce by half when hit by [[Overloaded]] DMG. If the Dracolite Shards are destroyed before charging completes, the Local Legend will be paralyzed for a period of time. Extinguishes its horns when the attack completes or is interrupted.
