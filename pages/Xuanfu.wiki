{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xuanfu:''' We're still a few herbal varieties short of completing Mr. [[Yiqing]]'s order. It seems we'll have to send someone to [[Bubu Pharmacy]] to buy them...
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Xuanfu:''' I'm Xuanfu, a very ordinary herb gatherer.
::'''Xuanfu:''' Feel free to let me know if you need any herbs. I'll do my best to get you some.
::{{DIcon}} Do you often gather herbs here?
::'''Xuanfu:''' Indeed, I am quite familiar with the mountains around here, so feel free to ask if you cannot find your way.
::'''Xuanfu:''' And I suggest staying away from [[Yaodie Valley]] unless you have a specific reason to go there. As far as I know, it is not welcoming to outsiders.
::{{DIcon}} About Yaodie Valley...
::'''Xuanfu:''' Honestly, though, I don't know much about Yaodie Valley. I've only heard the village elders mention it.
::'''Xuanfu:''' According to them, the valley is full of butterflies, and [[Herblord]]'s [[Adeptus's Repose|abode]] is hidden deep within.
::'''Xuanfu:''' Herblord is fond of peace and quiet, so I haven't attempted to explore the place, and don't know what it's like there.
:{{DIcon}} About Bubu Pharmacy...
::'''Xuanfu:''' Bubu Pharmacy can be said to be the best infirmary in Liyue.
::'''Xuanfu:''' Dr. [[Baizhu]]'s skills are impeccable, his pharmacy is packed with rare herbs, and the [[Qiqi|young girl]] in charge of getting the herbs is extremely nimble.
::'''Xuanfu:''' If I could attain just a tenth of their skill, I would have no regrets in this life.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Xuanfu:''' Be careful out there!
