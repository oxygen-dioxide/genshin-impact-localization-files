{{Description|These intelligent weasels live underground within the mining tunnels and caverns depths of The Chasm. Their fur has a unique blue sheen.<br />Having long become used to life in the darkness, they now have excellent hearing and olfactory senses.<br />Their jade-colored eyes and unusual fur have led miners to see them as an omen that gemstones are to be found nearby. However, there is no real connection between the two.|[[Archive]] Description}}
