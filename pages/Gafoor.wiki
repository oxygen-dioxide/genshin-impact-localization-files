==Profile==
Gafoor is a Spantamad professor and researcher who initiated a research project on the Ley Lines in Sumeru. It was implied during ''[[A Librarian's Long and Carefree Vacation]]'' that he and [[Lisa]] were classmates under a Spantamad teacher, [[Cyrus (Sumeru)|Professor Cyrus]].

===Personality===
During ''[[A Librarian's Long and Carefree Vacation]]'', Gafoor was seen talking to Lisa, urging the latter to come back to the Akademiya to help on the research project on the Ley Lines. Prior to the Traveler and Paimon entering the café, Lisa already refused his proposal but he still tries to recruit her and make her return as a Spantamad researcher; and in turn, let go of her duties as the librarian of The Knights of Favonius, which he thought is something that only wastes Lisa's talents.

Gafoor also has a slight distaste about [[Mondstadt]] as he cannot fathom what attracted Lisa on "that backwater".

===Appearance===
He is of average height and build with brown eyes, fair skin, and a moustache. He also wears a laurel crown, which might be an indication for someone who has a high position in the Akademiya.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Gafoor:''' We need more manpower. How are we supposed to manage with so few people? You know what? Just do as much as you can.
:{{DIcon}} About Lisa...
::'''Gafoor:''' So you guys met Lisa in Mondstadt? Are you sure she's just a plain old librarian?
::{{DIcon}} Yes, what's so strange about that?
::'''Gafoor:''' I didn't think there was anything about that backwater that would attract her there. Such a waste of talent.
::'''Gafoor:''' ... Okay, I know you're Lisa's friend, and I'm not gonna talk to her about that again, so stop giving me that dirty look.
::'''Gafoor:''' I was kind enough to offer her a chance, but she didn't seem keen. Fine by me, I guess.
:{{DIcon}} About Spantamad...
::'''Gafoor:''' Yes, we carry out regular monitoring of the workings of Ley Lines. This is one of our fundamental research principles.
::'''Gafoor:''' There are not enough talented folk who are professional and can independently undertake the work of exploring the Ley Lines. I've long said that we should allocate more people to come here...
::'''Gafoor:''' Alas, I can't find any researchers, so I have to recruit willing volunteers.
:{{DIcon}} Farewell.
::'''Gafoor:''' It's up to you to explore and clean up this Domain.
