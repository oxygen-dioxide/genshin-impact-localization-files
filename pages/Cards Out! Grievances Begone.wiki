{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo dpeq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Last night was so much fun! Paimon had a great time chatting with everyone. Hopefully we'll find someone in Inazuma to treat us to a meal, too!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 1 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Chatting? From what I saw, you were eating the entire time, Paimon.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, not the entire time! ...*burp*

;(Approach the Ritou Docks)
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, look! Promo posters everywhere, from the moment you arrive in the harbor!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon gets more and more curious about the two inventors of this game every time we see the posters.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You're not the only one. There's so little information to go off of that there's all sorts of wild speculations about them.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Some people say that they invented the game after the God of Wisdom gave them an epiphany, while others say that they're not actually the inventors at all...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' By the way, have you two ever read a book called King of Invokations?
:{{DIcon}} Haven't read it, no...
:{{DIcon}} I've only heard of it...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well, it's a story about a young boy who gets possessed by the spirit of the Crocodile King and becomes a TCG player. It's quite fascinating. I made sure to read it before coming on this trip.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Some people have even speculated that the author of King of Invokations is the boy who was possessed, while the true inventors of the game are the Crocodile King and Ibis King from the legends...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Each of these theories gets more ridiculous than the last...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Exactly, which is why the original author came forward to deny these rumors.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But that only fueled the debate further, and the book's sales skyrocketed.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It can't be denied that the King of Invokations novels are a major part of why Genius Invokation TCG has become so popular.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Just look at the venue, they're almost treating this like a national festival. I bet the book is going to sell more copies after this.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh, you can be sure that the fox lady is behind all this.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Fox lady?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, [[Yae Miko]]! She's chief editor of the [[Yae Publishing House]]. Paimon can just imagine her eating some Fried Tofu as she instructs her editors to use this event to boost light novel sales.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ah yes, I've been in that situation many times myself. Although in our case, the boss would be drinking coffee and talking about newspaper sales...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like bosses are the same everywhere...
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The scenery in every nation is so different. This trip is really paying dividends!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good thing that you're able to be so optimistic about it. It sounded like you were pretty much forced to come on this trip whether you wanted to or not...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, is that who Paimon thinks it is? It's [[Ei]]!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, we meet again.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, who is this?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, allow Paimon to introduce you... Huh, seems like that's all Paimon's been doing these past few days...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, this is [[Charlotte]]. She's a journalist from Fontaine. And this is Ei, she's, uh... She's Inazuma's archon.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' WHAT!? Y&mdash;You mean... Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder!? Ah, h&mdash;hello! Please forgive me for not recognizing you, I...!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' As a guest from afar, there's no need to be so formal.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Right, uh... I mean, okay...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Whew, each of your acquaintances is more impressive than the last.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Miko invited me here to experience the fun and festivities along with everybody else.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it. The tournament venue is full of excitement and tasty food, and Miko didn't want you to miss out.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I... guess I'll let you catch up for now. We can meet up later, just like last time.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing. See ya, Charlotte!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Perhaps she felt a little intimidated by me?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's probably fine. Don't worry, she didn't leave because of you, we've split up like this in the previous places we've visited, too.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, how do you like Genius Invokation TCG? Paimon bets you're enjoying watching the tournament matches.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Well... In fact, I myself am competing in the tournament.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, really!?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Why is that surprising? Playing cards is an ancient form of entertainment, and I was curious to see what card games are like in this day and age.
:{{DIcon}} How's the tournament been?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I advanced all the way to the semifinals.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The semifinals? That's amazing! So when's your next match?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Unfortunately, the semifinals is where my journey ended. The reason being...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' The reason being that she lost to me. And when I say "lost," that doesn't begin to do it justice. It was quite a humiliating defeat.
:{{DIcon}} How unfortunate...
:{{DIcon}} Didn't see that coming...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hehe, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 09.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I only lost because I was duped by her little tricks.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 03.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' What's wrong with my little tricks? Trickery within the scope of the rules is better known as ingenuity. It's not my fault that some people spend all their time cooped up in Tenshukaku and never have the chance to hone their skills.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a unique friendship...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 10.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Huh... You're right, though. I should make an effort to get out more.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 11.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Many things have changed now that Inazuma is at peace. However... it seems that some people continue to fear the "divine light" just as before.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 12.ogg}} '''Ei:''' In some of my tournament matches, I could see my opponent's hands shaking, hesitant to play their cards. Now that I think about it, perhaps they were scared of what would happen if they defeated me...
:{{DIcon}} Oh, Ei...
:{{DIcon}} You can't blame them.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 04.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' *yawn* Dear, dear. Other players lose their games and throw a tantrum... You win yours, and yet you still find a reason to mope about it.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 05.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' I invited you out for some simple fun and games... *sigh* I should have known you'd be like this.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 06.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Anyway, you should watch and learn, because I plan on using some more of my "little tricks" to defeat that Divine Priestess from Watatsumi Island.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? So Kokomi's your opponent in the finals?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 07.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Mm-hmm. On one side will be your erstwhile comrade in arms, the leader of Watatsumi Island, and on the other will be head shrine maiden Yae Miko, the wise and beautiful. So, little one, who will you support?
:{{DIcon}} Sangonomiya Kokomi.
::{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 08a 1.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hah, the nerve, saying that in the presence of me and Ei! Are you trying to find out whose lightning strikes faster?
:{{DIcon}} Yae Miko.
::{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 08b 1.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Good choice.
:{{DIcon}} Uhh...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 raidenei 13.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Miko, come on... no need to put them on the spot like that.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 09.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hehe, I know. I just wanted to see how they'd react.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 3 yaemiko 10.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' The venue is right over there. Why not go and take a walk around? Oh, and if you meet my fellow finalist, do pass on my regards.

;(Talk to Ei and Miko again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Miko... The people of Inazuma are afraid of me...
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' And for good reason, no? A bolt of lightning from you would make even my fur stand on end.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' You know I would never do such a thing...
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Nor would I eat anyone! Yet, a writer of mine seems convinced that I'd turn into an evil kitsune and eat him alive if he doesn't submit his drafts on time. Honestly, where do people get these ideas?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 yaemiko 03.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...Hmm, although to be fair, after I learned that he was afraid of me, I did start acting like I might actually eat him. Needless to say, his punctuality is now improving with each draft.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...

;(Talk to Qiuyue, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 qiuyue 01.ogg}} '''Qiuyue:''' The Almighty Shogun herself has come to Ritou to compete in the King of Invokations Grand Prix.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 qiuyue 02.ogg}} '''Qiuyue:''' How blessed we are. Her presence here today is sure to boost business in Ritou for a long time to come.

;(Talk to Vahid, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 vahid 01.ogg}} '''Vahid:''' Oh, if only I'd thought ahead, I could have sponsored the King of Invokations Grand Prix with my Anahitian Blessing. This could've been the perfect promotional opportunity for me!
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 vahid 02.ogg}} '''Vahid:''' Hmm, although on second thought... Who'd wanna win a bunch of fertilizer as a prize? ...*sigh*

;(Talk to Karpillia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 karpillia 01.ogg}} '''Karpillia:''' Is that the Electro Archon? You definitely don't see her every day.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 karpillia 02.ogg}} '''Karpillia:''' Huh, now that I think about it, I've actually never seen the Anemo Archon, either.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 karpillia 03.ogg}} '''Karpillia:''' Eh, but that doesn't matter. May the Anemo Archon continue to bring my business the winds of success.

;(Talk to Kaede, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kaede 01.ogg}} '''Kaede:''' Is that really the Almighty Shogun?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kaede 02.ogg}} '''Kaede:''' Huh... None of the figurines I sell in the shop come close to capturing her in all her glory.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kaede 03.ogg}} '''Kaede:''' Maybe it's time to release a new one...

;(Talk to Xixi, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 xixi 01.ogg}} '''Xixi:''' Everybody's been playing that card game lately... Maybe I should learn how to play? *sigh* But it'd take so much mental energy, it'd probably only make me even sleepier.

;(Talk to Kurisu, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kurisu 01.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' The Almighty Shogun's TCG skills were truly amazing to witness. She beat me fair and square.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kurisu 02.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Times have taken a turn for the better now. I'm sure that under the Almighty Shogun's rule, brighter days lie ahead for the International Trade Association.

;(Approach the venue)
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, compadre! And Flying Lavender Melon!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Grr, Bull-chucker! Don't call Paimon that in public!
:{{DIcon}} It's been too long.
:{{DIcon}} Did you two compete in the tournament?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahaha! What would this tournament be without Arataki "The Ultimate TCG Champion" Itto!?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Matter of fact, the whole Arataki Gang showed up in force. Our goal? To bring home the grand prize!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' And as fate would have it, Boss was the only one who didn't make it out of the qualifiers.
:{{Introductory Note|Kuki Shinobu}}
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' H&mdash;Hey! That's not the point. It was just some bad luck, that's all. I got matched against a strong opponent in the first round!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Besides, it was a close match. It could have swung either way!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' I wouldn't exactly call losing in three rounds a close match.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, Shinobu! Cut me some slack in front of my friends, okay? Anyway, it's not like you did much better! Weren't you beaten by that fish lady... Sandy Mamma-Mia... whatever her name was?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Sangonomiya Kokomi? Watatsumi Island's military strategist? Yes, she beat me fair and square. I don't have a problem with that.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Pfft, well anyway, I've noticed something in this competition. If you wanna win big here, you need style. That's right, I'm talkin' card backs! I lost my match 'cause mah backs were wack!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the style of card backs and a player's skill don't have anything to do with each other.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh, no no no no! That's where you're wrong, mini melon.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' It's just like how the strongest Onikabuto have the brightest colors on their back. If your cards look cool, then you'll definitely draw a better hand!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 04.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Boss, beetle fighting and playing TCGs are completely different. In cards, you actually have to rely on your own skill.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Yeah, there's no use arguing with you... Why don't we let our friend here weigh in, hmm?
:{{DIcon}} I think Shinobu has a point...
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 05a 1a.ogg}} {{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 05a 1b.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' See? {{MC|m=He|f=She}} agrees.
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 11a 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Alright, that's it, I know how to settle this. We're gonna play a match right now, you and me!
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I think Itto has a point...
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 11b 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' See, I knew you'd understand!
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 11b 2.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' And you know what, since you're here &mdash; let's play a match to prove I'm right!
:{{DIcon}} Why don't we play a match and see...?
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 11c 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' ...Hey, you're right! That's a pretty neat idea!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 12.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' How 'bout this... Shinobu, lend me your deck. You've got some pretty slick card backs.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 13.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hmm, but {{Traveler}} probably has cool card backs, too... maybe even better than yours. Okay, in that case, you can use my deck!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 06.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Boss, how do I put this... Nobody could win with that deck of yours. No matter who uses it...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 14.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey! Quit bustin' my chops, sheesh! Whaddya say, Traveler? You got time for a match now?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} I accept your challenge.
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 15a 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Great! See? This is what I call a true compadre! Hahaha...
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 07a 1.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' *sigh* Alright, I'll be the judge, then.
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 07a 2.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Just remember to take it easy, you two. This isn't a high-stakes match. It really doesn't matter who wins or loses.
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 itto 15a 2.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Shush! Do you guys hear that? It's the cry of my cards, cheering me on in the wind!
::{{A|vo dpeq003 4 shinobu 07a 3.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' ...MY cards, you mean.

:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gorou! Good to see you!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Hello, you two. Is there something the matter?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, we just wanted to say hello to Kokomi.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 02.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' Hmm, now that I think about it, her opponent in the finals will be a tough one to beat.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who are you rooting for, Sara?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 03.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' Up till now, the Almighty Shogun had my full support. But now that she's been eliminated from the tournament... In truth, I don't really care.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thought for sure that you'd be rooting for Miko.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 04.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' I certainly would, in the past.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 05.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' But now that the islands of Narukami and Watatsumi are on amiable terms, we're all friends.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Those are exactly Her Excellency's thoughts as well. The point of a game of cards between friends is to exchange skills and enjoy the game together. It's not about who wins or loses. She hopes that this spirit of friendly competition will define Inazuma going forward.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 06.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' Hmm, a commendable attitude.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 07.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' Her opponent is skilled in the art of deception. Even if she appears to have worry written all over her face, don't fall for it. She's likely trying to lead you into her trap.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's nice to see two generals who were once enemies on the battlefield now looking out for each other.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 08.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' Do not be mistaken. I speak only in the interests of fairness.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 09.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' The moment I saw the name "Sangonomiya" on the list of competitors, I anticipated that she would make it into the finals to face the Almighty Shogun.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 10.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' I've watched every one of her matches. She constantly adapts her strategy, and excels at employing rare and unusual tactics.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 11.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' But after the Almighty Shogun's loss, I'm afraid that Lady Guuji may also have caught wind of Kokomi's strategies.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you wanna make sure Kokomi's got intel on the other side, too? Wow, trust Sara to make sure everything is fair and above board.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 gorou 04.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Thanks for your insights, General Kujou. I will be sure to pass them along to Her Excellency.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 12.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' Don't mention it.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 kujousara 13.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' The match will be starting shortly. Please let her know to get back to the venue soon.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 5 gorou 05.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Alright, then I'll get going.

;(Talk to Kujou Sara again)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kujousara 01.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' I hope the final goes smoothly.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kujousara 02.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' Everything should be fine... as long as that oni manages to avoid causing a scene.

:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Paimon? Oh, and {{Traveler}}'s here, too.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Surprised to see us? We came to wish you good luck in the competition!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what are you doing out here, Kokomi? Taking in the view?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes, the soothing sound of the ocean's waves do make me feel peaceful, but I actually came here hoping to see Watatsumi Island.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Can you really see Watatsumi Island from here? Let Paimon take a look...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Well? Can you see it?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see... That must be Kannazuka, and a little further than that, there's Yashiori Island... Hmm...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, can't see Watatsumi.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Even on a perfectly clear day like this, you can't see Watatsumi Island from Narukami Island. Imagine trying to see it when the islands were surrounded by storms.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Though the islands are on peaceful terms now, the dark clouds of war still linger in some people's hearts.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Even when friends argue, they still need time to reconcile. Think of how much time is needed when the conflicting sides could never even see each other.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You okay, Kokomi?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, sorry... My mind was drifting to some more serious topics.
:{{DIcon}} You didn't join the tournament just to play cards...
:{{DIcon}} You're competing for other reasons, too.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes, I thought you might understand.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What are you talking about?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Who wins and who loses isn't what's most important.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' What's important is that Her Excellency came here to compete with all of Inazuma watching.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes, more people will be traveling between Watatsumi and Narukami Island from this day forward.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The point I hope to make is...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Even though we believe in different gods, we can all come together as friends by playing cards at the table. We should be willing to cooperate and assist one another in the future.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' You could say that I'm playing cards to help dissolve enmity.
:{{DIcon}} You're using a simple game of cards to drive major social change.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 13.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes, that's a good way to put it.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 14.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Besides, my passion has always been in tactics and strategy. How could I pass up the chance to play in a tournament for a strategic game like this?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so you have your personal reasons to play, too.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 15.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hehe. Yes, partly.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You should be careful of that fox lady. Even Sara warned us that she'll be a cunning opponent.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Yes. It seems that you're not the only one who sees this tournament as a chance to resolve our differences, Your Excellency.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 16.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, that's good to hear.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 17.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't worry, Paimon. I've already thought of a variety of stratagems for the match.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Paimon's really looking forward to the final now.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And Paimon swears that she's actually gonna see it this time, no matter what! Paimon won't let herself get distracted, not even by all the tasty snacks in Inazuma!
:{{DIcon}} I'm also looking forward to it.
:{{DIcon}} Good luck, Kokomi.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 6 kokomi 18.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Thank you. Alright, let's go.

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I interviewed a few people around Ritou, but no more details on the Card Snatcher, unfortunately. After that, I ran into Kirara here. We got to chatting, and then I found out that she knew you, too.

:{{Black Screen|Paimon tells Kokomi everything that's happened recently...}}
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Mm, I think I already have some insights regarding the truth of this matter.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? That fast!?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' But it's a little complicated, and the finals are about to start.

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Is actually Kirara.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh? Wait, what...? Me!?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Having chatted with Kirara, I was starting to think the same thing.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Sorry, I don't have time to explain now. We'll have to continue after the tournament's finished.
:{{DIcon}} Just focus on your match, Kokomi.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... What should we do? Paimon's still trying to wrap her head around that.

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' You took your time. I was starting to wonder if you got lost walking on the seabed, Miss "Sole of the Deep."
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' You must be tired after the walk back to shore. Perhaps I should let you go first?

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That Miko is a crafty one! Pretending she had no strategy and letting one of her own character cards get defeated...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then she played two cards from her hand that required her to have lost a character card. She came pretty close to turning the match around!

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 yaemiko 05.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' We'll see who wins next time. What do you say, Miss "Sole of the Deep"? How about a rematch?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' If Miss "Fried Tofu With All the Frills" hasn't gotten too cold, I would be happy to play.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' However, {{Traveler}} here is waiting for me to help them solve a puzzle they've been facing.

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 13.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ahem, now back to our conversation.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 14.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Kirara, you've been delivering items between different nations for the past several days, correct?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' That's right, I've had quite a few deliveries recently. But what does that have to do with the Card Snatcher?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The strange thing is that Kirara's delivery route has coincided with the card snatcher's movements at every turn.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 15.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes, and therein lies the clue.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean... Kirara is the Card Snatcher!?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh? Hey, that's not true! I'm just out here doing my job! You can't just throw false accusations at a person... Ah, I mean a youkai like this!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 16.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Calm down, you two. Kirara's not the thief.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 17.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Let me ask you, Kirara... Have any of your packages in the past few days been from the same sender? Or were any sent to the same destination?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 08.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Let me think... The senders have all been different. But there's one destination that keeps coming up, in every region I've been to.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? And what destination is that?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 09.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Um... I'm not at liberty to give you the exact address, but I can tell you that it's in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 18.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Were the contents light? No larger than the size of an envelope?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 10.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh? Wait... You're not one of those youkai who has prophetic dreams, are you!? I used to hear stories about that when I was curled up on my grandma's lap...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 19.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Haha. No, I'm only the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. I just like to read light novels and books about military strategy, divination's not my field.

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But there's still one thing that doesn't quite add up.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Kirara picked up her package in Mondstadt before we encountered the Card Snatcher. The timing doesn't make sense.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 22.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I've thought about that, too. The way I see it, there's more than one thief involved.
:{{DIcon}} So we're trailing not one, but multiple "card snatchers"?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 23.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes, the person you've been tracking most likely is one member of the group.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 24.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It seems the other members had already obtained the card backs and sent them together.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hmm, now that I think about it, collecting all those card backs across so many nations would be near impossible for just one person.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, why isn't the one we're following ever using Komaniya Express?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 25.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Because he's too slow. He probably missed the arranged shipment date. Well, that's how I figure it, at least.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 26.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' From your explanation, he's only committed theft on one occasion, and there were even witnesses. After that, he's been trading or playing to collect the card backs.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 27.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I suspect that this person isn't a very good thief. He probably used the Mora he was given to arrange shipments with Komaniya Express as funds to use for trading.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Then there's another question now. Why don't the other members just keep the cards and take them back to Sumeru themselves?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Unless... there's a reason for them to stay...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 28.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes, this is a question I'm still grappling with now.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 29.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' What is the thieves' objective? What kind of secret is hidden behind these card backs?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 30.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Unfortunately, there's no way to know without seeing one for ourselves.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 11.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' H&mdash;Hey, don't look at me like that! I can't just open a customer's parcel!

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 31.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' No, we don't want to cause you any trouble, of course.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 32.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' At this point... Mm, maybe it would be best for you all to accompany Kirara to Sumeru.

:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 15.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Whenever someone picks on me thinking I'd be an easy target to take packages from, I send them running!
:{{DIcon}} I'm still concerned about your safety...
:{{DIcon}} We have to get to the bottom of this mystery...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 16.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hmm, let me think about it...
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 17.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Alright, I'll let you come with me to the delivery point in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 18.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' But, on one condition!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 19.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You have to promise that you'll hide somewhere where the customer can't see you. Who's ever heard of a group of people delivering packages?
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No problem, you got it!
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kirara 20.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Also, even if the customer is a bad guy and has stolen things, we should leave that for the local authorities to handle.
:{{DIcon}} Absolutely.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Next stop, Sumeru! We're really traveling all over the place this time.
:{{A|vo dpeq003 7 kokomi 33.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Good luck. You'll have to tell me how everything turns out the next time we meet.

;(Talk to Sangonomiya Kokomi and Kujou Sara, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' General Kujou, could I have a word with you?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kujousara 03.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' Yes. Congratulations on your victory, Sangonomiya Kokomi.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I wanted to express my gratitude for the helpful advice you provided before the match.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kujousara 04.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' It was nothing. Anyone with a good head on their shoulders knows that skill and strategy ultimately determine the winner. In any case, it was an exciting match to watch.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It was unfortunate that you didn't register for the tournament as well.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kujousara 05.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' I'm afraid I'd be no match for you.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't say that. You're not so different from me... seeking chances to hone your skills in the game, considering countermeasures, and competing with others as if they're friends.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kujousara 06.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' ...Perhaps you have a point.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kujousara 07.ogg}} '''Kujou Sara:''' In that case, let's play a match of Genius Invokation before you depart from Narukami Island.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It would be my pleasure.

;(Talk to Arataki Itto and Kuki Shinobu, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Whew, that match between fox lady and fish lady really got my blood racing! The sweat's practically boiling off my forehead!
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 shinobu 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Yes, yes. I'm sure all of Ritou knows how excited you are, but the gang's all waiting for us. We should be heading back now.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ehh, they can wait a little longer... At least let my compadre and I play one last match! You can't say no to that... Pretty please?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Alright, let's play a match.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 itto 07a 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' That's my compadre! I knew you'd be down to duel! Only you understand a hardcore TCG player like me!
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 shinobu 03a 1.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Seriously, what will I do with you two...
:;(Start [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Arataki Itto/Duel: Arataki Itto|Duel: Arataki Itto]] stage)
:{{DIcon}} Maybe next time.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 itto 07b 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' ...Fine.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 itto 07b 2.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' It's okay, I don't blame you... But you should probably leave. You don't wanna see a grown oni cry...

;(Talk to Charlotte and Kirara, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I heard you refer to the opponent as a "kitsune youkai" earlier, could you tell me a little more about that?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Don't leave out any details. Who knows, maybe there's something I'll be able to use in my news piece.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Oh! I'd better not, I'm afraid of saying something wrong. Besides, I'm not really the most qualified youkai to answer questions.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Okay, then maybe you could help explain why a kitsune would have any interest in Fried Tofu.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ah, now your questions are making me hungry.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq003 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Why don't I just take you to try some Kitsune Ramen here in Inazuma? I can explain while we eat.
