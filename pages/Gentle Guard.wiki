{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Gentle Guard:''' The city beneath the starry sky is supremely splendid... The suspended stars sway, and the seas are still...
:'''Gentle Guard:''' Here, we have the sounds of clockwork winding up in the morning, and at night, the blended scent of vegetable oil and woodchips wafts over in waves...
:'''Gentle Guard:''' Each time I experience these, I feel like our world is so beautiful, so perfect, it's almost like it was lifted right from the pages of a story...
:'''Gentle Guard:''' ...Traveler, will you remember what stories transpired beneath this starry sky?
:{{DIcon}} ...Who knows?
::'''Gentle Guard:''' It's okay. At least the starry sky will remember. And I will remember too.
:{{DIcon}} I will.
::'''Gentle Guard:''' Haha... I hope that when you think of this starry sky, you too will feel that sense of serene bliss.
