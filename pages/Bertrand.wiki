==Profile==
Bertrand is a toymaker hailing from Fontaine, hoping to reach into the [[Inazuma]] market. Due to a hasty attempt to quickly break into the market, however, he created explosive toys, which got the [[Tenryou Commission]] involved. His toys were confiscated and he paid a hefty fine as a result, forcing him to borrow money from [[Kurisu]] to keep his project going. He placed a commission with the [[Adventurers' Guild]] to hire an assistant, a job [[Katheryne]] passed onto the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]].

{{Dialogue start}}
;(During Core of the Apparatus)
:'''Bertrand:''' Heh! If that's the amount I'm getting for one of these, then I just need to sell 20,000 of them to pay off my debt!
:'''Bertrand:''' What's up, (Traveler)? Is there something wrong?
:{{DIcon}}Create test products... <small>''(Unlocked after completing [[A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Mass Production|Mass Production]])''</small>
::'''Bertrand:''' Ohhh, have you collected all the materials? Let me activate the Great Machine for you!
:;(Opens [[Core of the Apparatus#Event Details|Product Creation]])
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to pick a toy to keep. <small>''(Unlocked after completing [[A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Mass Production|Mass Production]])''</small>
::'''Bertrand:''' Oho! Have you toy models you'd like to redeem? Just roll up with your redemption voucher, then... Though as we said before, you can only redeem four...
:;(Opens [[Core of the Apparatus#Redemption Vouchers|"Test Products to Redeem"]])
:{{DIcon}} So about the creation process...
::'''Bertrand:''' Ah, sure. I can explain that again, no problem.
::'''Bertrand:''' You have to collect the materials needed for the three processes while carrying the Collector on your person.
::'''Bertrand:''' The second step is "Elemental Charge," which can only be achieved by staying affected by the elements for a certain duration.
::'''Bertrand:''' Finally, we have "Core Activation," which can be done by defeating some elemental life forms to achieve the motive force required to start the core up.
::'''Bertrand:''' After this, the Material Collector should have finished collecting all we need. Then, it just needs to be placed into the Great Machine to begin production.
::'''Bertrand:''' If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.
:{{DIcon}} Let's have a look at our production record... <small>''(Unlocked after completing [[A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Mass Production|Mass Production]])''</small>
:;(Opens [[Core of the Apparatus#Redemption Vouchers|Product Archive]])
:{{DIcon}} No, nothing at the moment.
::'''Bertrand:''' Well, then keep flexing those creative muscles of yours! Honestly, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what else you'll make!
