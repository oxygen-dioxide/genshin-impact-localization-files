Nahida's hair is pulled into a braid from the right side of her head and merges into a ponytail on the left side of her head. She wears a large green headpiece on the left side of her head and a green leaf on the right side.

Nahida's outfit consists of a white dress decorated with green and gold details, short detached sleeves made of patterned green fabric, and a gold bangle on her right wrist. Her dress is adorned with a number of green gems and is decorated with intricate golden patterns. Under this, she wears a pair of white bloomers. On her back is a split pale green cape, and on her feet she wears short white stirrups adorned with gold that leave her mostly barefoot, with her toes and heels being exposed.
