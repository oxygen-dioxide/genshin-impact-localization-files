'''For All Knowledge, a Verse''' is [[Nahida]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Nahida's hair is pulled into a braid on the right side of her head and a ponytail on the left side of her head. She wears a large green headpiece on the left side of her head and a green leaf on the right side.

Nahida's outfit consists of a white dress decorated with green and gold details, short detached sleeves made of patterned green fabric, and a gold bracelet on her right wrist. Her dress is adorned with a number of green gems and is decorated with intricate golden patterns. Under this, she wears a pair of white bloomers. On her back is a split pale green cape and white socks surrounded with gold that leave her toes exposed.

<!-- this section is transcluded in multiple places unrelated to her outfit, so please take care with the wording --><section begin="Glowing Ornaments" />While wearing {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|For All Knowledge, a Verse||her default outfit, }} [[For All Knowledge, a Verse]], when Nahida's Elemental Burst is ready, the four green gem-like ornaments on her outfit and the chain-link symbol on the front of her dress will glow the way other characters' non-Vision gems glow along with their Visions. One gem is on the front of her collar, one is on the back of her collar, one is at the bottom of her skirt at the back, and one is on the fixture at the top of her cape at her back.<section end="Glowing Ornaments" />

<!-- this section is transcluded in multiple places unrelated to her outfit, so please take care with the wording --><section begin="Projection of Elemental Symbol" />Nahida has no object that appears to be a Vision while wearing {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|For All Knowledge, a Verse|this outfit|her default outfit, [[For All Knowledge, a Verse]]}}, but when switching to Nahida when her Elemental Burst is ready, the projected elemental symbol that is typically seen over other characters' Visions is seen over the leaf in Nahida's hair.<section end="Projection of Elemental Symbol" />
