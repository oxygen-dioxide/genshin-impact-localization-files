;(Daytime)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} Excellent liquor...
::{{A|VO Zhuoying 01.ogg}} "*slurred* This liquor is just how I like it... strong."

:{{DIcon|Idle}} Sea creature bones...

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zhuoying:''' What is wine and song... to me!
:{{DIcon}} Good poem.
::'''Zhuoying:''' Hahaha, it is indeed, and as blunt as liquor itself...
::'''Zhuoying:''' Sadly, however, this poem comes from a heartbreaking old story... *sigh* It hardly even counts as a poem.
::'''Zhuoying:''' Just like me, I hardly even count as a sailor anymore. I'm just a lush lingering between bottles of {{sic|liqour}}.
::'''Zhuoying:''' Ah, enough of that. Bottoms up!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Zhuoying:''' Goodbye, sea!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zhuoying:''' Hello, friend. Do you know what sea beast bones are used for?
:{{DIcon}} Do tell.
::'''Zhuoying:''' Long ago, sea beasts were a far greater threat to humans than they are now, so the bones of deceased sea beasts were valuable materials.
::'''Zhuoying:''' Sailors would adorn the stems of their ships with these bones to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies, while skilled artisans could forge powerful weapons from sea beasts' remains.
::'''Zhuoying:''' People who continue these practices now are few and far between.
::'''Zhuoying:''' My deepest thanks to the shipbuilders of Fontaine and the researchers who predicted the sea beasts' movements!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Zhuoying:''' You don't want to know? Fine, your loss.
