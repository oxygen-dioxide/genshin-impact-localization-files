==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Despite his name, Lawrence is not part of the [[Lawrence Clan]], but many people nonetheless mistake him as a member of the clan and ask about his relationship with them. He explains that his name came from his father, a [[Fontaine]] merchant, who had a bet with [[Wagner]] in which he would name his son Lawrence if he lost, unaware of the infamy of the clan at the time. Lawrence's father lost the bet, forcing him to call him Lawrence.

===Appearance===
Lawrence wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black shirt, pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads with brass-accented white plate armor worn on top. Only the forearm guards are black. Wing-like designs decorate various parts of the armor along with the Knights of Favonius crest on the breastplate. A sword hangs from his belt on the left.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lawrence:''' Welcome to Mondstadt, traveler. How can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(Unlocks after [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Lawrence:''' I had no idea what to do when the incident had just happened. At least we can finally draw all this to a close.
::'''Lawrence:''' Still, it's quite remarkable that we encountered such an event. Doesn't this mean that we, too, have witnessed history?
::'''Lawrence:''' Well, If anyone asks me for a tale or legend in the future, I'm going to tell them the story of Dvalin.
:{{DIcon}} What do you know about the [[Lawrence Clan]]...?
:;(Unlocks after starting [[The Spindrift Shall Never Return to the Sea]])<!-- Needs to be checked, if it starts immediately or after subquest 1 of 3 -->
::'''Lawrence:''' Heh... I actually have no connection at all to the Lawrence Clan. *sigh* It's a bit of a long story...
::'''Lawrence:''' You must know [[Wagner]], the blacksmith? Well, the one other thing he enjoys besides working with metal is drinking competitions. Placing a bet and seeing who can drink the most. The drunker he gets, the more outrageous the bets become...
::'''Lawrence:''' The whole reason his shop is called "[[Schulz's Blacksmith]]" is because he lost to his apprentice, [[Schulz]], in a drinking game.
::'''Lawrence:''' ...Ahem, now, my father is a merchant from [[Fontaine]], and he came to Mondstadt to do business. Though, you'd be forgiven for thinking he came for the drinking culture alone...
::'''Lawrence:''' One day, the two of them got drinking together. My father bet on his son's name &mdash; that is to say, my name, and... yeah.
::'''Lawrence:''' *sigh* At that time, my father was not to know that the name "Lawrence" came with so much baggage...
::{{DIcon}} So, what was the outcome?
::'''Lawrence:''' The outcome... well, as you can attest to, every few days, I get someone coming up to me and asking what my connection with the Lawrence Clan is.
::'''Lawrence:''' My father gets extremely remorseful about the whole thing every time I bring it up...",
::'''Lawrence:''' ...Mostly because if he'd just managed to get one more drink down him, Wagner would have had to name his most prized weapon "Pinky the Rabbit"... *sigh* ...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Mondstadt.
::'''Lawrence:''' Known as both "The Crown of the North," and "The City of Pastoral Song," there are no words that can truly describe the beauty of this city.
::'''Lawrence:''' A new bard arrived in the city not long ago. You should seek him out if you want to feel the true essence of Mondstadt.
::'''Lawrence:''' But the songs he plays are... a bit archaic?
::'''Lawrence:''' ...Those songs date back thousands of years. No clue as to how he knows them...
::{{DIcon}} Are there any legends about Mondstadt?
:::'''Lawrence:''' You've come to the right person.
:::'''Lawrence:''' It's said in Mondstadt, a [[Darknight Hero|righteous hero]] often appears at night.
:::'''Lawrence:''' But no one knows his true identity...
:::'''Lawrence:''' I should stop there, or else I'll keep talking about him. If the Acting Grand Master catches me chatting on duty again...
:::'''Lawrence:''' Sorry, guess I'll talk to you next time.
::{{DIcon}} Are there any anecdotes about Mondstadt?
:::'''Lawrence:''' Anecdotes...? Not sure if this counts as one.
:::'''Lawrence:''' When I'm on my shift here, I'll sometimes notice the weather change very suddenly.
:::'''Lawrence:''' Um... Rather than a natural phenomenon, it feels more like someone is manipulating the weather. But who has that much power to do that?
:::'''Lawrence:''' Even the higher-ranking knights in the Knights of Favonius don't seem to have the ability to do that. How strange.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Lawrence:''' Goodbye, traveler. Hope you have a good time in Mondstadt.

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lawrence:''' Welcome to Mondstadt &mdash; make sure you don't miss out on the [[Windblume Festival]].
:{{DIcon}} About the Windblume Festival...
::'''Lawrence:''' When we speak of the Windblume Festival, the topic of the Windblume's legend is an inevitable one.
::'''Lawrence:''' The Windblume Festival has its origins in Old Mondstadt, and people all have their own opinions concerning the true identity of the Windblume.
::'''Lawrence:''' At the moment, the two most popular must be the "Dandelionite" and "Asterist" schools of thought.
::'''Lawrence:''' Of course, there are those who believe that neither of these is the true Windblume...
::{{DIcon}} About the Dandelionites...
:::'''Lawrence:''' Oh, they believe that the [[Dandelion]] is the Windblume. I believe that this is the most mainstream line of thinking.
:::'''Lawrence:''' The Dandelionites believe that the Windblume Festival is a festival for lovers and that they should express their love with the most extravagant sincerity during this time.
:::'''Lawrence:''' Passionate people in love will often travel to Cape Oath and express their feelings for one another amid the billowing Dandelions and profuse [[Cecilia|Cecilias]]...
:::'''Lawrence:''' It's all rather romantic, wouldn't you say?
::{{DIcon}} Then, about the Asterists...
:::'''Lawrence:''' Those who believe that the [[Windwheel Aster]] is the Windblume are certainly not few, but they are not as numerous as those who believe it is the Dandelion.
:::'''Lawrence:''' They believe that the liberation of Old Mondstadt from tyranny should be at the heart of the festival...
:::'''Lawrence:''' ...And that instead of celebrating love, this festival is more suited to remembrance.
:::'''Lawrence:''' If you think about it, this view does have its merits as well...
:::'''Lawrence:''' But it isn't the majority. I guess people just want to have a relaxing, good time during the festive season...
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Lawrence:''' Happy Windblume Festival!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Of Ballads and Brews===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lawrence:''' Welcome to Mondstadt, Traveler. Please enjoy [[Weinlesefest]].
::{{DIcon}} About the Weinlesefest...
:::'''Lawrence:''' Weinlesefest is an autumn festival to celebrate the harvest of the Mondstadters. We use the fruits of the harvest to make drinks to dedicate to the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]]. He will then bless everyone with the West Wind.
:::'''Lawrence:''' That said, for Mondstadters, it doesn't matter whether Lord Barbatos actually shows up or not. The festival is just a good time to drink lots of wine.
:::'''Lawrence:''' Although drunk people are troublesome, I can't really say anything when I see nothing but uplifted spirits from drinking.
:::'''Lawrence:''' After all, everyone has worked hard all year and deserves a good celebration.

===Windblume's Breath===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lawrence:''' Welcome to Mondstadt &mdash; make sure you don't miss out on the Windblume Festival!
:'''Lawrence:''' The Windblume Festival has its origins in Old Mondstadt, and the legend of the Windblume carries still to this day.
:'''Lawrence:''' Even now, most Mondstadters believe that the Windblume Festival is a festival for lovers and that they should express their love with the most extravagant sincerity during this time.
:'''Lawrence:''' Of course, there are also the more traditional amongst the Mondstadters who think that the key purpose behind the Windblume Festival is to celebrate Mondstadt's liberation. For them, this festival is more suited toward remembrance than love.
:'''Lawrence:''' I believe that both of these perspectives are fine. Everyone should get to choose the way they wish to celebrate.
:'''Lawrence:''' I hope that everyone can find their own jow during this Windblume Festival, including you! Happy Windblume Festival, friend!
