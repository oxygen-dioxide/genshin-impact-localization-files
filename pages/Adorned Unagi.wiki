{{Description|A slender, amphibious fish that has the peculiar habit of warming itself up at shallows or sandbanks.<br />The lovely meat of the unagi has a unique flavor when grilled, and is a much-beloved delicacy in Inazuma.|[[Archive]] Description}}
'''Adorned Unagi''' is a species of Unagi which can be found in [[Inazuma]], notably on [[Watatsumi Island]]. It normally can be found with its upper body sticking out the water. After catching one Unagi, nearby ones will normally hide and disappear.

If [[Sayu]] is in the party, her utility passive skill [[Yoohoo Art: Silencer's Secret]] can be used and it won't be startled.
