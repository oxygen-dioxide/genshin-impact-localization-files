'''Adorned Unagi''' is a species of Unagi which can be found in [[Inazuma]], notably on [[Watatsumi Island]]. It normally can be found with its upper body sticking out the water. After catching one Unagi, nearby ones will normally hide and disappear.

Catching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[archive]].
