|text      = Thanks to you, our new combination of fine wine and alchemical fragrance has been met with an enthusiastic response indeed, with many clients and customers passing along their personal compliments to me. Though as I see it, the one they should realty be praising is you.

According to etiquette, I should have invited you over to the winery for dinner and thanked you in person by now, but choosing the right gift took longer than I anticipated.

After giving the matter much thought, I decided that it would be most fitting to prepare one myself.

This fragrance is one I created under [[Adelinde]]'s guidance, and it's one of my personal favorites.

I hope you like it too.
