The '''Akasha System''' was developed by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] by using her [[Gnosis]] and expanded on by [[Sumeru Akademiya]] after her death. It allows for the transfer and sharing of information via a device called the '''Akasha Terminal''' that is powered by the Dendro Archon's [[Gnosis]].

==Background==
The Akasha Terminal is a unique piece of Sumeru technology invented by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and further developed by the Akademiya.<ref name="Boat">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Silent Seeker of Knowledge}}</ref> It takes the shape of an earpiece. It is capable of granting the user any sort of knowledge they desire to have, as long as they have the required credentials. Although this device can be used anywhere within the borders of Sumeru, its potency is best achieved in larger settlements such as [[Port Ormos]] or [[Sumeru City]]. Everyone who arrives at Sumeru City is provided with one, the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] included. In order to activate the device, the user must hold it in their hand and say the phrase "May the Mighty God bless us with their voice of wisdom." Upon uttering this phrase, the device will instantly activate and be available for use.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}</ref> Aside from travelers and outlanders, it is also utilized by the majority of Sumeru's population. However, because of the old prejudice between the Desert and Rainforest people, when people originating from the Desert come to Sumeru City, they are automatically given lower clearance than people from the City no matter what their job is.

Prolonged use of the Akasha System and Canned Knowledge carries great risks: firstly, the knowledge asserts itself as true to the user and is difficult to forget, which makes it difficult to correct if the knowledge turns out to be wrong, and secondly, excessive use diminishes one's ability to think.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Suspicious Smuggling Case}}</ref> Even experienced users have had difficulty perceiving the world accurately when the Akasha already funneled knowledge into them, as seen by Grand Sage [[Azar]] when he went to check [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s status.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Jnagarbha Day}}</ref>

The Akasha Terminal is capable of harvesting the Jnana Energy of Sumeru's people, and is the reason people in Sumeru do not dream.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Empty Illusions of the Sabzeruz Festival}}</ref> By gathering people's dreams, the Akasha Terminal can combine the knowledge of all the people in Sumeru City, something [[Dehya]] likens to turning Sumeru City into a "single, massive brain."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Continuation of the Sabzeruz Festival}}</ref> Greater Lord Rukkhadevata created the Akasha System to "borrow" the dreams of her people and empower her, as she was unable to eradicate the second coming of the [[forbidden knowledge]] invading [[Irminsul]] with her strength alone.<ref name="Boat"/> Recently, the Akademiya's sages maximized the Akasha's output by trapping the denizens of Sumeru City in a samsara, harvesting their dreams repeatedly as part of their plans to elevate [[Scaramouche]] to godhood.<ref name="Secrets of the Scorching Desert">{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>

The Akasha System is also capable of computation.<ref name="Cry From the Eleazar Hospital">{{Ref/Quest|Cry From the Eleazar Hospital}}</ref> With this function, the Akasha System can produce new data, such as predicting the movement of certain persons based on their existing data. The Akademiya used this to escape the claws of [[Cyno|General Mahamatra Cyno]] during his investigation.

Lesser Lord Kusanali is referred to as "The First Akasha Terminal," and can enter anyone's mind as long as they're wearing their Akasha Terminal. However, she refuses to possess living beings unless absolutely necessary, instead opting to control [[Katheryne]] due to her being an artificial lifeform.<ref name="Dawn">{{Ref/Quest|Dawn (Quest)}}</ref>

A weaponized upgrade of the Akasha Terminal, the "Neo Akasha Terminal," was created by Kusanali. This floating device assisted the Traveler in their battle against [[Joururi Workshop|Shouki no Kami]].

After Kusanali was freed from the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]], she chose to halt the usage of the Akasha System, as it had fulfilled its purpose in restoring Irminsul and she deemed it not beneficial for her people's well-being, even though it was pointed out that some may resent her for it. The system is no longer operational, as she gave up her Gnosis to [[Il Dottore]] following an information exchange. This in turn has also allowed the people of Sumeru to dream once more.

Before the Akasha System was shut down, [[Moseis]] was able to create imaginary, hyper-realistic models of people within a dream, requiring only a miniscule portion of the Akasha's Jnana Energy supply to do so. By transferring his consciousness to the Akasha, Moseis was able to become the host of that dream while still being fully awake, ensuring that it would never collapse due to him waking up. Thanks to signaling devices which he implanted on specific individuals, Moseis was able to continue harvesting Jnana Energy from them to fuel his dream, even after the Akasha was turned off. Additionally, those with the signaling devices planted on their bodies were thus connected to a network that allowed them to enter the dream.<ref name="Moseis">{{Ref/Quest|Dream of Falling}}</ref>

==Canned Knowledge==
[[File:Item Activated・Canned Knowledge.png|thumb|Activated Canned Knowledge]]
Canned Knowledge is information contained within a Knowledge Capsule. Unlike the information from the Akasha System, which restricts access to knowledge based on the user's demographics, anyone can learn the information in a Knowledge Capsule. To use it, one must link it to their personal Akasha Terminal.

While Canned Knowledge is safe to use if used sparingly, the risks are such that the Akademiya has banned the possession, sale, and usage of Canned Knowledge across Sumeru, with those found guilty of those things having their right to study at the Akademiya revoked.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Puspa Café Message Board|Matra's Message}}</ref> Despite its illegality, extensive smuggling operations have been formed to create Canned Knowledge and sell it on the black market. Canned Knowledge is used by those who are dissatisfied with the information provided to them by the Akasha, like the Eremites, commoners, and some Akademiya students.<ref name="Lost in Prosperity">{{Ref/Quest|Lost in Prosperity}}</ref>

Some Knowledge Capsules are higher in quality than others; more valuable ones are richer in [[Dendro]] energy and thus tend to show up brighter when using [[Elemental Sight]], though this is not always completely accurate. For example, once-useful knowledge may still shine brightly even when it has become less relevant in the modern day.<ref name="Lost in Prosperity"/>

The Canned Knowledge contained within Knowledge Capsules can be relatively obscure, ranging from "An Analysis of the Sociological Ideology and Dialectics of the Hilichurls" to "An Introduction to Traditional Sumeru Brewing Techniques." Much Canned Knowledge has been leaked from the Akademiya itself.<ref name="Lost in Prosperity"/>

Lesser Lord Kusanali was able to extract Moseis' consciousness from the Akasha into a Knowledge Capsule so that it could be imported back into his brain.<ref name="Moseis"/><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dream of Farewell}}</ref>

===Divine Knowledge Capsule===
A Divine Knowledge Capsule is a Knowledge Capsule that supposedly contains the wisdom of the gods. Divine Knowledge Capsules glow bright red. The knowledge from Divine Knowledge Capsules is extracted from scholars that have gone mad trying to link their minds to Irminsul;<ref name="Secrets of the Scorching Desert"/> the tree contains remnants of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s consciousness,<ref name="Dawn"/>  which is the source of the divine knowledge, but is also contaminated by forbidden knowledge, which drives the scholars insane. Anyone who attempts to draw knowledge from Divine Knowledge Capsules goes mad, as seen when [[Mizri]] violently attacks the Traveler and [[Alhaitham]] before muttering Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's last words, "World... forget me."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ever So Close}}</ref> Sumeru Akademiya's sages sought to use the divine wisdom contained in the Divine Knowledge Capsules to turn Scaramouche into a god.<ref name="Secrets of the Scorching Desert"/>

==Jnagarbha Day==
Jnagarbha Day is a special occasion when the [[Akademiya]] enters new information into the Akasha System.<ref name="Cry From the Eleazar Hospital"/> Beside data for the general granting knowledge function, data of specific people can also be entered to make use of the Akasha's computation function. The Akademiya is typically more crowded than usual during Jnagarbha Day.

After Lesser Lord Kusanali shut down the Akasha System, Jnagarbha Day was no longer needed.

<!--The information entered as news and announcements do not need to wait until the next Jnagarbha Day.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Akademiya Public Message Board|Canned Knowledge Smuggling}}</ref> It supposes that the data entered during the Jnagarbha Day required deeper access to the Akasha, and the Jnagarbha Day itself may be akin to the Akasha's maintenance day.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* In Sanskrit, {{Lang|{{w|akasha}}|sa=आकाश|sa_rm=''ākāśa''}} means "sky," "space," or "{{W|Aether (classical element)|aether}}."
** The Akasha System may draw inspiration from the {{W|Akashic records}}, a collection of "memories" of every thought, feeling and event since the beginning of time. The records are imprinted on the ''akasha'' (aether), and are said to be accessible to select individuals.<ref>Britannica: [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Akashic-record Akashic Record]</ref>

* Jnagarbha is likely derived from the Sanskrit compound {{Lang|''jñānagarbha''|sa=ज्ञानगर्भ, lit.|sa_tl=knowledge-womb}}; which can be translated to mean "filled with knowledge," or "knowledge matrix."
