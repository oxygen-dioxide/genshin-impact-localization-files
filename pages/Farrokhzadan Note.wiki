===Farrokhzadan Note (I)===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (I):''' "... This part of the desert seems to be [[Tanit]] territory. They're pretty reasonable people... After we exchanged some gifts and promised not to disturb their hunting grounds, they let us go..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (I):''' "... They used to be a group of irrational faithfuls to the [[Goddess of Flowers]], but recently they grew prosperous, and their name swelled loud even amongst other mercenary companies..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (I):''' "... [[Lunja]] wasn't very pleasant to them either. Word is, a few years ago, someone named [[Azariq]] stole a very lucrative piece of business from right out under her nose. Business that was worth a few hundred thousand Mora..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (I):''' "... The advanced payment alone was something like 150,000 Mora..."

===Farrokhzadan Note (II) ===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (II):''' "... Why does this place have a [[Fatui|northerner]] camp? When the sun goes down, I'll send [[Minum]] and [[Ziri]] to take a look..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (II):''' "... Those two useless, rubbish, good-for-nothing, absolute buffoons! Not only did they almost get discovered, they also managed to lose Aidi during their escape! We spent ages training that dog!
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (II):''' "... Come to think of it though, things aren't too bad. Aidi must still be able to see our signal from here. It's a well-trained Eremite hound after all..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (II):''' "... That northern girl and our dog sure seem to be getting along wonderfully. It didn't see the signal at all... That traitorous mutt..."

===Farrokhzadan Note (III)===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (III):''' "... The valley holds a great many ancient ruins. Ruins also equal Mora, and where there's Mora, there's also the Farrokhzadan..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (III):''' "... Took me some care to avoid those patrols. My heart's racing... But all I found were some stone tablets? They seem to have ancient text etched into them. I can't understand the words..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (III):''' "... Lunja ordered us to collect some of those slates. Said something about being able to sell them to those book-lovers in the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]]. Maybe we just might strike it rich..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (III):''' "... So, celebrations led to libations and the next thing I know, I'm coming too, and the collected slates were there, spilled out in shattered fragments across the floor..."
:'''Farrokhzadan Note (III):''' "... I think there should still be a way to patch them up... We are people with no little skill in craft and artistry, after all..."
