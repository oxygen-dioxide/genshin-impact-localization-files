'''''Cleansing Defilement''''' is a [[World Quest]] in [[Inazuma]]. It is the third part of the [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] questline.

==Steps==
#Complete the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual (0/3).
#*The locations are in [[Chinju Forest]], [[Araumi]], and [[Kamisato Estate]]

==Gameplay Notes==
*The rituals at Araumi and the Kamisato Estate can be completed during the previous quest, Sacrificial Offering, in which case the quest's step will start at ''(2/3)'' instead of ''(0/3)''. However, this will not affect Hanachirusato's dialogue.

==Walkthrough==
The order of completing the rituals doesn't matter.

===Ritual in Chinju Forest===
{{Main|Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest}}
[[File:Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest Puzzle.png|right|200px|thumb|Puzzle in Chinju Forest]]
# Teleport to Chinju Forest and follow the path up the mountain. Then head slightly left towards the statue of a big tanuki.
# Defeat the [[Electro Cicin Mage]] and a few [[hilichurls]] nearby first. Then talk to the statue.
# [[Ioroi]] asks you to play with three tanukis.
#* One ("Shousei") will appear on the path with the gates and turn into an unlit '''torch'''. Light the torch to reveal the tanuki.
#* Another ("Kichiboushi") will appear as a '''barrel''', surrounded by hilichurls on a rock.
#* The final tanuki ("Gyoubu Kohan") is sitting on a rock along the forest path. Follow it until it leads you to '''three unlit torches''', in which the middle one is the tanuki. Light it to finish this step of the quest.
# Claim the ward given by the big tanuki statue.
# Head to the designated area to reveal a Torii gate. Set the lanterns to the right numbers, and then activate the first lantern.
# Defeat [[Ochimusha]].

===Ritual near the Kamisato Estate===
[[File:Cleansing Defilement Puzzle Kamisato Estate.png|right|200px|thumb|Puzzle near Kamisato Estate]]
# Teleport to the Kamisato Estate and head north-east. Glide down the cliff to a large Inazuman cedar tree.
# Use the [[Memento Lens]] on the small stone kitsune. Use an Electro attack on the newly revealed sky kitsune statue and pick up the [[Key-Shaped Ward]].
# Use the [[Waverider]] to head further north-east towards the flat tide with the wrecked ship. There is a small stone kitsune statue in the middle of the island. Use the memento lens on it to open the underground shaft.
# Glide down the shaft to the shrine and solve the puzzle. Beware of the [[Balethunder]] effect.
# Defeat Ochimusha ×2.

===Ritual in Araumi===
[[File:Cleansing Defilement Puzzle Araumi.png|right|200px|thumb|Puzzle in Araumi]]
# Activate four Electro pillars near the tower ruins in order to unlock the mechanism. Two of the pillars are in the open, one is guarded by three [[Ruin Sentinels]], and one is locked by a cube maze (top cubes are grouped and need to be facing the same direction to unlock).
# Activate the mechanism and climb into the destroyed tower. Use the Memento Lens on the three glowing kitsune statues and activate the mechanisms that appear behind them. This will take you into a cavern.
# Use the Memento Lens again near the entrance to make an [[Electrograna|Electrogranum]] appear. Pick up the Electrogranum and run through the Electro barrier. Use an Electro skill on the sky kitsune statue and pick up the ward.
# Head back to the Torii gate and place the ward in the lantern to start the puzzle. Two lanterns in the back are disguised as kitsune statues, so use the Mementos Lens to reveal them. Activate the lanterns.
# Defeat Ochimusha.

After cleansing all of the shrines, go back to the well in [[Konda Village]] and meet with Hanachirusato. This will start the final part of this quest line, [[Yougou Cleansing]].

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Hanachirusato says that in order to complete the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual, one must break the barrier in 5 places and destroy the "defilement incarnate" that will then come forth. Besides Konda Village and the abandoned shrine, there are three other places where the barrier surrounds the Thunder Sakura roots: Chinju Forest, Araumi, and below the tidal flats outside the Kamisato Estate. She says that she will await you at the Thunder Sakura root below the well in Konda Village.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Hanachirusato]])

===Ritual in Chinju Forest===
{{Main|Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest#Dialogue}}

===Ritual in Araumi===
;(Upon reaching the shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, this must be one of those barriers that the masked shrine maiden was talking about, right?
:'''Paimon:''' So where's the ward, then? Let's take a look with the Memento Lens!
<!-- The below dialogue is replaced with the one above. -->
<!-- :'''Paimon:''' Hmm, what should we do... Let's use the {{Color|buzzword|Memento Lens}} and have a look at it, shall we? -->

;(Upon discovering the fox statue)
:'''Paimon:''' Found it! There's a fox statue with a {{Color|buzzword|ward}} right here!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers that we gotta use {{Color|buzzword|Electro}} or {{Color|buzzword|zappedy-zap}} it to retrieve our ward...

===Ritual near the Kamisato Estate===
;(Upon discovering the fox statue)
:'''Paimon:''' Found it! There's a fox statue with a {{Color|buzzword|ward}} right here!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers that we gotta use {{Color|buzzword|Electro}} or {{Color|buzzword|zappedy-zap}} it to retrieve our ward...

;(Upon reaching the shrine)
:'''Paimon:''' P&mdash;P&mdash;P&mdash;Paimon's tingling all over...
:'''Paimon:''' I&mdash;It's t&mdash;t&mdash;too much...

===Post-Ritual===
;(If it is the second ritual done by the player)
:'''Paimon:''' Done! We're one step closer to finishing the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon was thinking the masked shrine maiden would show up...

;(If it is the third ritual done by the player)
:'''Paimon:''' "Eek"{{sic|!...|hide=1}} Eh? Aw, Paimon thought Miss Hanachirusato would suddenly appear behind us.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, whatever the case, this is the fifth and final root.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon was sure that after this last one, she would, suddenly appear behind us with a *poof* and give us the treasure!
:{{DIcon}} *Poof*? What do you mean?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, like *Poof*! What else is it supposed to be like?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, guess we've finished the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual!
:{{DIcon}} Quite the breeze, eh?
:{{DIcon}} That was quite the ordeal.
:'''Paimon:''' For sure!
:'''Paimon:''' We walked almost the entire Narukami Island and even went to the bottom of the sea. Paimon is so tired!
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'm the only tired one here...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, Paimon's been cheering you on really hard, okay?
:{{DIcon}} Guess it's okay.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Didn't Miss Masked Maiden say that we should go back to her after purifying all five roots?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's sure we'll get a reward. {{Traveler}}, let's enter the barrier in the well in Konda Village to find her!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's ready for that treasure... as long as it's not tanuki food again.
