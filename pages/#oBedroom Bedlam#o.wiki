|description    = A medium-sized dwelling commonly found in [[Merusea Village]]. It has a unique exterior and elegant contours, and is spacious on the inside, enough for two to three [[Melusine]]s to rest within at the same time. However, due to the acoustic peculiarities of its internal layout, sounds produced inside such houses are greatly magnified. As such, any noisy Melusines who make cause too much of a problem might be shut inside for a bit, to talk to themselves until their hearing goes numb...
