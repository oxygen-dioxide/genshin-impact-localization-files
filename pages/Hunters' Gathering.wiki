#* Wave 2: {{Enemy|Praetorian Golem|x=1}}

==Gameplay Notes==
* During steps 3–9, the active party will be limited to the Traveler and a trial Furina, Lyney, and Navia.
* In "Easy Mode," every time the player makes a check, the "check difficulty" value will be added to their randomly drawn number, therefore guaranteeing success. This does not apply to "Combat" checks.
* While roleplaying, the player's appearance will change depending on which skills they chose to learn.<!-- If both "medicine" and "cooking" are chosen, appearance depends on how the player chooses to introduce themselves -->

:{{A|vo cllq002 1 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Whoa! They really have thought of everything. Even the Fateometer is here and ready to go for us!
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...The Fateometer? What's that?
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It's a card that's used to determine action success or failure. We'll need to use it when we try to use certain skills.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And what about all the dessert and tea? Is that for us as well?
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' That's what the message said.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Really? That's so nice... It feels just like a tea party with friends.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Those snacks have Paimon's name written all over them!
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, I think you might be more of a "Snack Hunter" than a [[Marechaussee Phantom|Marechausee Hunter]], Paimon.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Snack Hunter Paimon, reporting for duty! If there are delicious snacks to be found, Paimon'll track down every last one!
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The desserts are great, but I'm still looking forward to the story more than anything.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Very fair. Then let us begin.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' First, please pick up the blank character cards in front of you, and write down your name and profession.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You can find an abbreviated version of the rules printed on the back of your character card. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' In this story, everyone is a Marechaussee Hunter. To reflect this, the club has prepared a small badge for everyone.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Nice!
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' As Hunters, you have proficiency in swordsmanship and fighting by default, so there's no need to allocate any additional skill points to those areas.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Swordsmanship? So there's a fighting part to all of this? Umm... Paimon's not sure she can do all that on her own. Maybe Paimon can just stick with you?
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 07b.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Why don't you share a character card, then? {{Traveler}} will be the Marechaussee Hunter and you can be {{MC|m=his|f=her}} little floating assistant.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hahaha, kinda like in real life.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So, for the name... Do I fill it out with the name of my character?
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Yep. It can be any name you like.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You can use your real name too, if you want. I do that whenever I get too lazy to think of a new name.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh! So, it would be like... like experiencing a different life, but still as yourself? That's not a bad idea.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm, in that case... I think I'll continue to use the name "[[Lyney]]," then.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Next up is the skill sheet. You have a limited amount of skill points that you can use to learn a number of skills. The more points you invest in a particular skill, the easier it will be to pass associated checks.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm, I'll take "persuasion" and "investigation"! Those are must-haves when it comes to missions like these.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, those skills sound like they'd be useful for gathering intelligence. Good idea [[Navia]]! Just as expected of a veteran player!
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm... So should we also take those skills, then?
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Not necessarily. Since we're working together as a team, we could leave the negotiations to Navia, and use our skill points to pick up other useful skills.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' For example... I think I'll take "stealth" and "sleight of hand." That will give us more options if we run into any situations we can't negotiate our way out of.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, interesting! I wasn't thinking about it like that. I suppose it's not so different from an acting troupe, everyone has their own role to play.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Let me see... I'll take "arts" and "performance." I'm not quite sure what use they'll be, but I'm not as knowledgeable about the other skills, and I'm not too confident I'd be able to roleplay them well.
:{{A|vo cllq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that leaves us! What do you want to learn, {{Traveler}}?

:{{A|vo cllq002 2 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You've all picked such classic skills! It's fine to go a little bit out of the box, you know.
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' (...Why do I get the feeling she's getting ready to cause trouble...)
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' For example... This one here! "Summon"! Doesn't it sound super mysterious and cool?
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, I saw that one just now as well. The description says... "This skill can be used under certain circumstances to summon characters or creatures that fit the script's worldbuilding rules."
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The script's worldbuilding rules, huh... But, how are we supposed to know what a Marechaussee Hunter can summon?
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's not for us to worry about, my friend! Just learn the skills that interest you, and the GM will take care of the rest!
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, you've convinced Paimon... Let's learn "Summon," then! Paimon can't wait to see what kind of thing shows up.
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...Well, now that everyone's more or less finished creating their characters, we can begin.
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Since two of our players are doing this for the first time, though, let me ask...
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Would you like to play on "easy mode," or "authentic mode"?
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, what's the difference between the two?
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Well, in roleplaying games, the story sometimes changes based on the decisions of the players and the results of the Fateometer.
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' For example, if you "fail" a check, that means you cannot use the target skill in that scenario. A "critical failure" may even result in further negative consequences.
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' If you choose to play in "authentic mode," every time you elect to use a skill, you'll need to use the Fateometer to see whether you succeed or fail, and face any consequences that may follow.
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' If you choose "easy mode" instead, every check will be successful by default, and you won't have to worry about luck playing a factor.
:;(Open [[#Tutorials|Tutorial]])
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm... Given that I'd like to focus on the story, I suppose I should pick "easy mode." I'd feel bad if I brought the team down by failing my checks...
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh? C'mon, don't worry about that! RNG is the lifeblood of roleplaying games! I'm going with with "authentic mode" for sure!
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Never knowing what you might have to overcome... Doesn't that sound exciting?
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Um... I&mdash;I'd rather be mentally prepared for what might happen...
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Alright. Then I'll mark down [[Furina]] for "easy mode." All her checks will be successful by default. As usual, Navia and Lyney will play on "authentic mode."
:{{A|vo cllq002 2 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What about you, dear partner? How would you like to play?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to pick "easy mode"...
::{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 12a 1.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Are you sure?
::{{DIcon|Talk OK}} Yep, I'm sure.
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 lyney 02a 1.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Mhm, no need to worry about the pesky Fateometer. Pretty good choice if you just want to relax and play the game.
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Honestly, I don't think [[Clorinde]] would make things too difficult for us no matter what the Fateometer says... Isn't that right, Clorinde?
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 14.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' No promises.
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... That wasn't super reassuring!
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, anyway, enough talk! Let's get started! I want to experience at least a good chunk of the story today.
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Speaking of the story... Why is the beginning scene on a beach?
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 15.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Well, that's because...
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 16.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' A long time ago, back when human civilization was still in its infancy, powerful demons and evil sorcerers ruled over the land. They created a host of monsters and sent them to slaughter all humans in existence...
:::{{A|vo cllq002 2 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Soon, a group of human rebels banded together. With their swords raised, they swore to brave the darkness and, in doing so, subdue each and every monster that sought their destruction. They became known as the Marechaussee Hunters...

:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Some time later, as a member of the Marechaussee Hunters, you receive a commission. Following the address provided on the message, you take a boat and arrive at this strange city.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As you inhale, you can taste the slightly salty air of the docks as you begin to survey your surroundings. There aren't many people in the vicinity, but you do take note of a few others who, like you, seem to be sizing up this place.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Your eyes meet, and you realize these people are fellow Marechaussee Hunters, likely led to this location after receiving the same commission as you.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You're all Marechaussee Hunters too, right? Allow me to introduce myself! The name's Navia &mdash; monster hunter by trade and helpful neighborhood businesswoman on the side.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What say you to traveling together? We can help each other out on the road.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Okay! Count me in.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' My name is Lyney. I've been wandering since I was little, and picked up a few less than legal tricks along the way. I was adopted by a Marechaussee Hunter and, later, chose to follow in his footsteps.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Is this where you introduce your character to everyone? It sounds like they've done this dozens of times.)
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' My name is Furina, and um... I grew up in a noble family. I always had a strong interest in performance and the arts. Even though I'm a Marechaussee Hunter, what I really want is to be a performing artiste...
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hey, that's really cool!
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (You can do it, Furina! That's exactly how it's done!)

:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You open your envelopes at the same time. The message reads...
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' "To the honorable and trustworthy Marechaussee Hunters: our kingdom is currently facing a grave crisis."
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' "The lands outside the capital have been overtaken by monsters, and our people are being led astray by forces of wickedness. We beseech you, please help us resolve this crisis, and return peace and stability to our home."
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, the layout of this city looks super familiar... It kind of reminds Paimon of [[Mondstadt]]!
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The script writer must have used a real-world city as a reference when coming up with the map.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Ahem... As experienced Hunters, the layout of the city reminds you of places once traveled. You recall the sight of tree-lined streets and the gentle tranquility of days gone by...
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Yet, as you regard the city in front of you, it appears to be little more than an empty shell. Its hollow gates are open to you, beckoning you to come forth and bring salvation back to the town.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I carefully read every line of the letter and turn my attention to the signatures at the bottom. Who issued this commission to us?
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You see a long string of unfamiliar names. It would seem that many of the residents of the city issued this commission together. They sensed that things were not right within the kingdom and sent a distress signal to the outside world.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm, in that case, why don't we take a walk around the city, and see if we can learn anything from the local residents?
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Good idea! We might be able to get some leads on the monsters and bad guys we're after!
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You look up and see a tavern nearby. It appears to be open for the day.
:{{A|vo cllq002 3 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Why don't we go check out that tavern? If the novels I've read are anything to go by, taverns are usually full of information.

;(If the player approaches the map boundaries)
:{{A|vo cllq002 23 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' It doesn't seem like there's any information to be gained from the area up ahead. You conclude that this area is best left unexplored at this time.

;(Approach the Tavern)
:{{A|vo cllq002 5 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As you approach the tavern, you find a plainly-dressed woman standing nearby. She appears to be rather troubled about something.
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Greetings, friend! Lovely weather we're having today, don't you think?
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' Oh, hello... I suppose you're right. The weather today is quite lovely. If only those monsters out there would stop causing trouble...
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (It seems like every character included in the script has a certain amount of useful information to offer. If we keep asking questions, we might be able to get some good leads.)
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Come now, don't be sad! Life is all about optimism! Oh, that reminds me, what did you have for breakfast this morning?
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Uh... I don't think that's the kind of question we're supposed to ask...)
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Nothing turns a frown upside down like good food! How about some Macarons? I could make you some!
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (...You didn't even take cooking as one of your skill proficiencies!)
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' Ah... That's not necessary, Miss. Excuse me for saying this, but you don't really look like a chef. Besides, I'm not really a fan of sweets...
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So you're someone who barely smiles and doesn't like sweets... Huh, you're really starting to remind me of this one friend of mine...
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' Tch...
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hey, did she just "tch" me?
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Clorinde must have broke character for a second!)
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This isn't getting us anywhere... {{Traveler}}, maybe you can think of something?
;(If cooking was chosen as a skill)
:{{DIcon}} How about I cook something? Right here, right now!
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' ...Are you sure?
::{{DIcon}} Positive!
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' In that case, please refer to the Fateometer.

:::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 16.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You remain silent as you prepare a pot and fire to use for cooking. The woman stares at you with her mouth agape as you skillfully cut the ingredients and toss them into the pot.
:::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As the soup gently simmers, steam rises from the pot and a hearty aroma begins to fill the air. All trace of sadness is wiped from the woman's expression, replaced by a look of barely-suppressed anticipation.

:::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 20.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' A Marechaussee Hunter? No... My husband is just one of the guards from the capital.
:::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 21.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' A horde of monsters suddenly appeared near the capital recently, so all the guards were dispatched to fight them.
:::{{A|vo cllq002 6 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Do you remember when those monsters appeared?
:::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 22.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' ...I'm not completely sure. All I know is that my husband was dispatched to fight them three days ago.

;(If insight was chosen as a skill)
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to do an insight check to see what's troubling her.
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 32.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The results of insight checks aren't disclosed to the players, so I'll be the one consulting the Fateometer.
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 33.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You recall all the lessons you've learned in your time and begin to carefully observe the woman's mannerisms.
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 34.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You notice that when she's quiet, she has an empty look in her eyes, as if her thoughts have drifted to a place far, far away. And when she speaks, she often subconsciously reaches out to touch the ring on her left hand.
::{{DIcon}} Did something happen to your husband?
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 35.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' Ah... So you noticed. That's a little embarrassing, haha...
:{{DIcon}} Um, any help here, Lyney?
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ahem... Miss, we'd love to learn more about the "monsters" you mentioned. If you're willing to open up to us, we might just be able to help resolve the troubles you're facing.
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (You weren't even the one that learned "persuasion"...)
::{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 36.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' My troubles, you say... *sigh* I'm not sure they're so easily resolved, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to share them with you.
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 37.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' A horde of monsters suddenly appeared near the capital recently, so all the guards were dispatched to fight them.
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Do you remember when those monsters appeared?
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 38.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' ...I'm not completely sure. All I know is that my husband was dispatched to fight them three days ago.
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Do you know where he was sent?
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 39.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' It all happened so fast. When we said our goodbyes, he couldn't even tell me where they were sending him.
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You have our thanks, friend. We'll find and defeat those monsters as soon as possible. We sincerely hope your husband will be able to return to your side soon.
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 40.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' Thank you...
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Don't worry, we'll find him! Just try to remain optimistic and wait for good news!
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We don't always get to choose what happens to us, but we do get to choose the little things, like what we eat and how we respond to the things life throws our way. I hope that, one day, you too will recognize the power of something as small and inconsequential as a delicious dessert!
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 41.ogg}} '''Melancholic Young Woman:''' I... I'll do my best.
:{{A|vo cllq002 6 clorinde 42.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You bid farewell to the woman and continue your journey further into the city.

;(Approach the stalls)
:{{A|vo cllq002 7 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As you venture further into the city, the streets appear largely empty. An elderly woman walks past. You see her shake her head as she puts away her wrinkled wallet.
:{{A|vo cllq002 7 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' A nearby merchant folds his arms and gives you a disdainful look. You get the impression that he's someone who has long gotten used to the sight before him.
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Although he doesn't seem very... friendly, merchants are usually a good source of information, right?
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Pardon me, sir. I'd like to ask a question, if I may.
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' That depends. How much are you willing to pay?
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' How about... this much?
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Tch, what do you take me for, some lowly beggar? You can't even buy half an onion with that amount!
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Surely an onion can't be that expensive... right?
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' What do you know? War is nearly upon us. Everything costs several times what it did before! If you're not gonna buy anything, then scram.
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, what a nasty guy. Maybe we shouldn't even bother talking to him...
:{{A|vo cllq002 8 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But he still might have information we need. {{Traveler}}, can you think of something?
:{{DIcon}} "Persuade" him, Navia!
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 navia 02a 1.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Sir, we came to this city to solve the very problem you seem to be referring to. The "war" you mentioned... would it happen to be against the monsters outside the city?
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 navia 02a 2.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If you happen to be well-informed, and know a thing or two about what's going on, we'd appreciate it if you could share that information with us. After all, the sooner this problem gets resolved, the easier it will be for you to do your business.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04a 1.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Hmph. Well, things are basically as you said, young lady.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04a 2.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Those monsters are camped outside the city, and they've been destroying all our trade routes.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04a 3.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' We have limited reserves within the city, so if this continues, we're all going to be in big trouble.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03a 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wait, you're saying no one has put a plan in place to distribute supplies or maintain order?
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04a 4.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Hah, we could all starve, and those nobles in the palace wouldn't even break a sweat.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04a 5.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Who knows? Maybe they've been in cahoots with the monsters all along.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03a 1.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That is concerning...
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04a 6.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Alright, alright, that's all the information you need, right? Off with you, now. I've still got business to do...
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 navia 02a 3.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You know, if you smiled a little more, you'd definitely get more business, and I bet that would make your life just a little bit sweeter! I'm not saying it's guaranteed to work. It's just a tip!
:{{DIcon}} Lyney, you're up!
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03b 1.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Okay, while everyone is talking, I secretly use my magic props to summon a bottle of wine without the merchant noticing.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03b 2.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We meant no offense, sir. Here, allow me to offer you this bottle of vintage wine, made only from the finest grapes. I'll just leave it here. Please, enjoy it at your leisure.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04b 1.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Hmm?
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03b 3.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, I should mention that this wine is the perfect accompaniment to a meal. I'd suggest enjoying it with dinner.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04b 2.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Hmm... Hmph, alright. Go on and ask. What do you want to know?
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03b 4.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Do you have any information on the monsters, or the crisis that has overtaken the kingdom?
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04b 3.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Crisis? Ha, if you ask me, there's a crisis everywhere you look.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04b 4.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Those monsters are camped outside the city, and they've been destroying all our trade routes.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04b 5.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' We have limited reserves within the city, so if this continues, we're all going to be in big trouble.

::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04b 7.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Who knows? Maybe they've been in cahoots with the monsters all along.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03b 5.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That is concerning...
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03b 6.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Thank you, sir. We won't take up any more of your time, now.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 paimon 02b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, why did you leave in such a hurry?
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03b 7.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Weeeell, you see, that bottle of "wine" was just a cardboard prop.
:{{DIcon}} Furina, put on a performance!
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03c 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (A performance? I've never played a roleplaying game like this before, but even I can tell that suggestion is pretty far-fetched. Is a performance check really going to help here?)
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03c 2.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Um... Alright. Ahem...
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03c 3.ogg}} '''Furina:''' By the harbor's grace, a lone boat lies in rest, let the moon give chase, for here begins our quest.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03c 4.ogg}} '''Furina:''' In the dark of shadow, our heroes seek to find, where creatures born of evil, weave their grand design.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03c 5.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Blocked the road does stand, such is our hunters' plight, yet with sword and courage in hand, they march forth to pierce the night.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04c 1.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Hmph, I don't recall asking for a bardic song. Don't expect me to give you any coin.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04c 2.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' But if you meant what you sang, and you are indeed some kind of hunter... Then by all means, please go out, and kill those monsters for us.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04c 3.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Those monsters are camped outside the city, and they've been destroying all our trade routes.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04c 4.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' We have limited reserves within the city, so if this continues, we're all going to be in big trouble.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03c 6.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wait, you're saying no one has put a plan in place to distribute supplies or maintain order?

::{{A|vo cllq002 8 lyney 03c 1.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That is concerning...
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 clorinde 04c 7.ogg}} '''Gruff Merchant:''' Alright, I think I've said more than enough. Be on your way, now.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03c 7.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Got it. Thank you, sir.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 paimon 02c 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't mind him, Furina. He just doesn't have enough taste to appreciate your art.
::{{A|vo cllq002 8 furina 03c 8.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, no, I was just thinking about... how those nobles must be so cold-hearted. It's like they don't care about their people at all!
:{{A|vo cllq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Should we try to go somewhere with more people?
:{{A|vo cllq002 9 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ooh, how about the city square! Follow me!

;(Approach the city square)
:{{A|vo cllq002 10 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Before you lies the city's central square. You see a man with a slightly anxious look on his face pacing back and forth, his head hanging low.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' He doesn't seem to notice your approach. Still immersed in his own thoughts, he shakes his head and lets out a long sigh.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (This guy seems promising enough. Maybe I can get some information out of him!)
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hello, sir! Is there anything I can do to help you?
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Wait, you're...!
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Erm, I'm...
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Oh, dear goodness, you're... you're a Marechaussee Hunter!
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You recognize us? Ah, are you... one of the people who wrote the commission letter?
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Yes, yes! I didn't expect you to actually come. What great news... The city is saved!
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What happened here?
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Alas... We once lived comfortable, carefree lives. This city used to be free of monsters. The first Marechaussee Hunter, [[Cassiodor]], the "Golden Hunter," he was the one who drove them back.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' However... Monsters have once again surrounded the city. Perhaps the seal that kept them at bay has lost its power, or perhaps an evil sorcerer has been meddling in our affairs. All I know for sure is that their return has stripped this city of any chance at peace.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Are there... not enough soldiers to drive them out?
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' It's not a question of numbers. The guards simply have no idea how to deal with them.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Most people my age have never even seen one of the monsters, much less been trained to fight against them. What's worse, many of us don't even know the history of the Marechaussee Hunters anymore.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' When I was child, though, my grandfather would tell me stories about how the Marechaussee Hunters drove back the monsters. So, on the off-chance that something might come of it, I decided to reach out to you.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' To be perfectly honest, I was starting to think all those stories were just tall tales, but now that I've seen you in person, I finally know that it was true!
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, you can rest easy, friend! The righteous and formidable Marechaussee Hunters are on the case!
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The man is touched by your determination and resolve. His eyes begin to well with tears of relief.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Still, if we're going to hunt the monsters, we need to know where to find them. Can you give us any leads?
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 13.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' All I know is that the area outside the city is dangerous. I'm afraid I can't point you toward a specific location.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 14.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Although, if you leave the capital through the main gate and follow the road, you should run into a group of guards. They might know more about where to find the monsters.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I see... We'll go look for them, then.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 15.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Alright, be careful. Oh and... one last thing. The monsters outside the city are just part of the problem. There are evil sorcerers inside the city as well, so be on your guard.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 16.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' They're actively working with the monsters, and have corrupted the court ministers with malicious magic. They're the reason why, even inside the city, everything has been a giant mess.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Even one of our kindest ministers has turned into a boorish and unreasonable figure, interested in nothing but enacting laws that exploit the people. Who knows how much longer we'll be able to go on like this...
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Talk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place...
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I feel bad for him. Maybe we should try to cheer him up?
:{{DIcon}} I could cook something?
::{{A|vo cllq002 11 furina 06a 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, not everything can be solved with food!
:{{DIcon}} Furina could sing him a song?
::{{A|vo cllq002 11 furina 06b 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? Like... now? Is this really the right time...?
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 18.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' I appreciate your kindness, but for now, it's more important to focus on the crisis at hand.
:{{A|vo cllq002 11 clorinde 19.ogg}} '''Anxious Man:''' Brave Hunters, I leave the future of this kingdom to you.
<!-- special screen transition -->
----
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If I understood correctly, there are currently two problems in the kingdom that need solving, right?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Exactly. We need to defeat the monsters outside the city and take down the evil sorcerers stirring up trouble from within.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But, which problem should we tackle first...
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Well, this seems like a good moment for a break. Take some time, and discuss what you want to do. Let me know when you've made your decision.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh... I really didn't expect the people in the city to keep us at arm's length like that. I totally thought the Hunters would be treated like heroes.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Clorinde said the script took cues from the real history of Fontaine, right? Maybe the real-life Marechaussee Hunters were also treated like that?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I wouldn't say it's a perfect representation of history, but there are definitely some similarities. Would you like to hear more about it?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Sure, as long as it doesn't spoil anything in the script! You've brought up bits and pieces of the Hunters' history before, but it was all in passing.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to know, too! The Hunters were super powerful, right? Were they all from a special line of supernatural beings or something? Kinda like... the [[youkai]] in [[Inazuma]]?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' No, all Marechaussee Hunters were ordinary mortal fighters. The only thing that set them apart were the special sword techniques passed down over the centuries.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So you mean... anyone could become a Marechaussee Hunter?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' In theory, yes. All you would need to do is survive the rigorous training, and master the swordsmanship techniques required to fight the monsters.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Still, most people dropped out at the early stages, and others called it quits the minute they saw a monster in person. To become a Hunter, you must be strong in both body and mind.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What kind of monsters did the Hunters fight exactly? Oh and, the "evil sorcerer" the script mentions &mdash; did they exist in real life, too?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' The land of Fontaine once played host to an ancient dynasty known as [[Remuria]]. After that dynasty fell, monsters began to appear, intent on obstructing humans from establishing a new social order.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' One of the ancient sorcerers of Remuria used his power to assemble a formidable army of [[Praetorian Golem|golems]]. He sought to use that force to establish himself as king.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Now wait a second! Don't tell me that guy was the inspiration for the evil sorcerer in the script! We still haven't found any in-game information on him yet, so why don't you talk about someone else for now?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Well, I wasn't planning on going into anything you might be able to find out in the game... But, if you want me to talk about something else, then... How about Cassiodor, the Golden Hunter, or [[Egeria]], the ex-Hydro Archon?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but those people are all from a super long time ago! Where did you learn all this, Clorinde?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' From my master.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' By "master," you mean... Ms. [[Petronilla]]?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Someone you know?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Absolutely. Ms. Petronilla and my father were good friends. Back in the day, she would often bring Clorinde over to play. But then...
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...Let's not get off topic. Anyway, back to what I was saying...
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Responding to Egeria's call, a number of warriors followed Cassiodor into battle against the monsters. This group of warriors, under Cassiodor's leadership, became known as the Marechaussee Hunters.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Yet, as Fontaine entered an era of peace, their work gradually became obsolete. The Marechaussee Phantom, originally an association made up of Hunters, eventually came to be predominantly comprised of [[Melusine]]s.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, I see... That explains why most of the people in the script have forgotten the Hunters or think of them as nothing more than a legend.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Is that really a bad thing, though? It can get tough always being the one shouldering everyone's expectations.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm, depends on who you ask, I suppose. If the name of the organization no longer commands respect, investigative work is bound to suffer.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Speaking of investigations, which problem should we tackle first? Monsters, or evil sorcerer?
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I vote monsters. That's the main duty of the Hunters, right? We can come back to the sorcerer later.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well said, Miss Furina. Plus, if the sorcerer really are the masterminds behind this whole thing, defeating the monsters could give us some clues on their intentions as well.
:{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What about you, partner? What do you think?
:{{DIcon}} I also vote monsters.

:{{DIcon}} The sorcerer problem seems pretty important...
::{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 08b 1.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I mean... you're not wrong. But, those characters are usually the ones pulling the strings behind the scenes. More often than not, they're very formidable opponents. Going after them now might be jumping the gun a little bit.
::{{A|vo cllq002 12 navia 08b 2.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We don't want a total party kill on the first day, right? With Clorinde as the GM, I wouldn't rule out the possibility...

:::{{A|vo cllq002 13 clorinde 33.ogg}} '''Guard Captain:''' Those monsters aren't easy to deal with. Our soldiers are too young to be of much help, and now I'm out of commission as well...

:::{{A|vo cllq002 13 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' He informs you of the various locations where monsters have appeared. He looks in that general direction with a pained gaze, as if a thin, invisible thread is pulling on his wound.

::{{A|vo cllq002 13 clorinde 47.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Every so often, you see him glance toward a particular direction with a pained expression on his face, as if an invisible thread is tying him to an unknown place.
::{{A|vo cllq002 13 clorinde 48.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As you follow his gaze, you vaguely recall that the location he seems fixated on is known for its difficult terrain. Any battle that breaks out in a place like that is likely to be prolonged and devastating.

:{{A|vo cllq002 20 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We're lucky the Marechaussee Hunter class came with all those preset skill points. Otherwise, we would've been in some real trouble.

:{{A|vo cllq002 21 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, I can understand your excitement, Paimon, but think about it... Doesn't it seem like there are people out there who need this treasure more than us?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yeah! Think about all the people suffering in the capital or all those guards who got hurt fighting the monsters... Wouldn't it be better if we gave the treasure to them?

:{{A|vo cllq002 21 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, even if we end the game for the day, we can still stay a little longer and hear Clorinde finish her story, right? Paimon wants to hear more about the history of the Hunters...

:{{A|vo cllq002 21 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That's just a coincidence, okay? Besides, to Paimon, not finishing free food feels even worse than having to buy her own!
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And anyway, Paimon really does want to hear more about Clorinde's master!
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well...
:{{DIcon}} If the story doesn't have a happy ending...
:{{DIcon}} It's okay not to finish it...
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It's nothing. I appreciate the concern, but it's all in the past. It won't do any harm to share these things now.
<!-- time passes -->
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' My earliest memories are of living with Master. According to her, she saved me from certain people of ill repute. My birth parents had left me behind some time before that.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (What a heavy beginning for a life story...)
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Master was a fascinating individual, if... inexperienced in the ways of raising children.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' My first ever toy was a short sword. Although, I suppose it wasn't so much a toy as something Master removed from her waist and handed to a noisy child in need of distraction.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wait, so she... handed an actual sword to a child? Isn't that dangerous!? Did you hurt yourself?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Of course I did. I cut my palm, and bled quite a lot. But Master was not concerned. She just stood there and casually lectured me about it&mdash;
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' "See? That's what you get for not holding the sword properly," she told me. She then crouched down next to me and said, "Give me your hand. I'll teach you to bandage this wound. After that, it's time to learn how to truly hold a blade."
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Excuse me for asking this, Clorinde, but... how old were you, exactly, when all of this happened?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 13.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Probably around... three? Give or take.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Three!? Isn't that when most kids are still struggling to hold a fork?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 14.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' As I said, Master was... rather inexperienced in the ways of raising children. She believed trial and error was the best way to teach a child what they're capable of.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' (I'm not so sure this is a question of "experience"...)
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 15.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I didn't see anything wrong with her ways at the time, and, anyway, children don't get to choose how they're raised... Oh, she did bring me back a pet from [[Liyue]] once. It was a [[Geovishap Hatchling]].
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A Geovishap Hatchling!? For a pet!? That seems even more dangerous!
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 16.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' What she said was this &mdash; "Make sure to get along, you two. If you really can't agree on something, just settle it with a fight. Whoever loses is the real pet."
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Uh... And how old were you when this happened?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Five.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well... Did you win?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 18.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' No, I lost.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you're saying... You actually became... the Geovishap's pet?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 19.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Yes, but only for a week. By the end of that week, I defeated it in combat, and we've shared a cordial relationship ever since.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (That really doesn't sound like the kind of childhood someone should have...)
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 20.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Later on, I gradually understood that Master most likely didn't know any other way to raise a child. She was a Marechaussee Hunter, but I never heard her bring up her own parents.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 21.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Thanks to her, I learned how to navigate the forest by the age of six, and could hunt monsters in the wild by myself the year after that.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 22.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Even though the training she subjected me to was strict, she always made sure to take me traveling when she had the time. We met many of her friends during those days... That was also how I met Mr. [[Callas]] and his family.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I still remember the first time we met. You were too scared to join our picnic and hid behind Ms. Petronilla the whole time.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 23.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I still... hadn't really met many children my age at that time, so I didn't know how to interact with others.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' After that, though, you started coming over a lot. You loved challenging people to shooting competitions, remember? I don't think many members of the Spina ever beat you in one of those.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 24.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I had a lot of fun during those days.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe, I enjoyed them too! Oh, do you remember that one time we went exploring around the [[Spina di Rosula|Spina]] together? We overheard Papa call your Master Fontaine's "Protector of Justice."
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We tried to pretend like we never heard anything, but you nearly let it slip that one time, hahaha...
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' "Protector of Justice"? Wait, you mean... that vigilante hero from twenty years ago? The one who was always active at night?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 25.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Yep, that would be her. She would often put on a black cloak and go out at night. I never knew where she went or what she was doing... until, like Navia said, we overheard the truth from Mr. Callas that night.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Twenty years ago, huh... I still remember the [[Garde]]s leaving all kinds of witness reports about her on [[Neuvillette]]'s desk.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 26.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' My apologies.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh... There's no need to apologize! You had nothing to do with it. And, anyway, everything she did was for a good cause.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Although, calling herself the "Protector of Order" was a bit much, especially when she deliberately operated outside the law...
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? When did the "Protector of Justice" become the "Protector of Order"?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, she had a bunch of codenames. I heard she would just come up with a name on the spot whenever she was asked...
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Later on, she probably got sick of answering those questions and decided to stick to just two &mdash; the "Protector of Justice" and the "Protector of Order."
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 27.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' That sounds like her, all right. I bet she forgot which of the two she'd used by the time she got back each night.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, she certainly sounds like a fascinating individual. With her strong sense of justice, it's no surprise her student followed in her footsteps.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 28.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It's true. I always wanted to become like her. Someone powerful, independent, and with a strong sense of conviction... But...
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But...?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 29.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...She suddenly disappeared the night I turned ten years old.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Disappeared!? What happened?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 30.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I have no idea. She didn't even leave a note. I was never able to find out where she went.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 31.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' That night, I was celebrating my birthday at Navia's house, but Master never came to pick me up. When I returned home on my own, it was to an empty house.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 32.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' When she still didn't appear after a few days, I went to Mr. Callas' house to ask about her whereabouts, but he only shook his head.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Papa probably didn't know, either. I know he sent a few people to investigate the matter in secret, but... they never found any credible leads.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 33.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Don't worry, I understand. To be perfectly honest, given Master's personality and way of doing things, it all made a lot of sense. If I had to guess, I'd say she probably used it as an opportunity to force me to become independent.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 34.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Just like how... when a litter of kittens reaches a certain age, the mother willingly leaves them behind.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Were... Were you upset, Clorinde?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 35.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I was at first, but not anymore. I don't believe Master would suddenly disappear for no reason. There must have been something she just had to do.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, despite everything, you still managed to follow in her footsteps and become the greatest [[Champion Duelist]] in all of Fontaine! You're practically a living symbol of law and justice!
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 36.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Hmm, I suspect my position would be far too "by-the-books" for her. Master always did whatever she pleased. But... you're right. I suppose I do take after her in some ways.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Who knew Clorinde had such an interesting past... I never had the chance to ask her about it before.)
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (I wonder.. If Clorinde's master were the Champion Duelist back then... Would that duel against Mr. Callas have gone differently?)
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Oh no... Judging by the atmosphere, Clorinde and Navia are probably thinking something similar. The mood just got super awkward all of a sudden...)
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, anyway! Would you look at the time? It's getting dark, so we should probably call it a day for real this time. If we keep talking like this, we really will be here all night!
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I had a great time today, Miss Clorinde. Thank you for being our GM.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 37.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Anytime.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The script was good, but I've got to say, your childhood stories were even better!
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hey, you should tell us more about that fight against the Geovishap some time! Maybe your master was onto something, hehe!
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 38.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Hm, you could be right.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (What does she mean, "onto something"? I certainly don't know any five-year-olds who want to fight a vishap in their spare time!)
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Guess I'll head back as well. I need to save my energy if I want to continue enjoying the story tomorrow.
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 clorinde 39.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You're that excited to hear about my fight with the vishap?
:{{A|vo cllq002 21 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I was talking about the script!
;(Quest completes)

;(Talk to Clorinde or Navia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cllq002 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Um... Just between the two of us, could you tell me what it was like to be the Geovishap's pet?
:{{A|vo dialog cllq002 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It was nothing special, really. Geovishaps don't understand the concept of a "pet." So, basically, it just headbutted me whenever I entered its territory.
:{{A|vo dialog cllq002 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And that... hurt?
:{{A|vo dialog cllq002 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Yeah, it hurt. What, something you want to experience for yourself?
:{{A|vo dialog cllq002 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'm good, thanks!
