'''Noctilucous Jade''' is a [[Local Specialty]] found in the wild all over [[Liyue]].

==How to Obtain==
Noctilucous Jade is dropped by Noctilucous Jade nodes, which are found at the base of cliffs and in caves and mines throughout Liyue; many can notably be found around [[Mingyun Village]]. Like all ores, Noctilucous Jade nodes are best damaged by [[Blunt Attack]]s or {{Color|Geo DMG|link=Geo}}. Each node can drop one to three Noctilucous Jades when broken.

See the gallery or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=42 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Noctilucous Jade after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
*[[Chang the Ninth]] in [[Qingce Village]], [[Liyue]] (4 Noctilucous Jades)
