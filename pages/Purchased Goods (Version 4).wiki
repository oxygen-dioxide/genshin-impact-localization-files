|description  = Items that Nilou bought for the Zubayr Theater. Apart from materials for making performance props, there are other items here that either fall under daily use or celebratory purposes. It is too much of a burden for one person to move this stuff themselves, to the point where even Paimon tried her best to lighten this heavy load.
