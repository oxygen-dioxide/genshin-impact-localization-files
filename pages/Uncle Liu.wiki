==Profile==
Uncle Liu is [[Shuzhi]]'s next-door neighbor. In his youth, he would peep at Shuzhi through windows, and the latter would smile at him in return. Uncle Liu, however, never told Shuzhi the way he felt, and the two eventually grew old.

===Personality===
Uncle Liu spends most of his time reminiscing the past. Although he was greatly attracted to Shuzhi in his youth, he never confessed his feelings to her. He views the act of confessing one's feelings to a girl as shameful. Shuzhi calls Uncle Liu a "silly fool" due to him not taking the initiative.

===Appearance===
Uncle Liu is an elderly man with a slim build and midnight blue eyes, framed by a pair of gold circular glasses. He wears gray capris pants with triangular dark gray tidings near the bottom, paired by low dark brown shoes. His dark teal tang suit is accompanied by an open dark brown vest, held together by a hazel belt.

:'''Uncle Liu:''' Hey, youngster. What can I do for you?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Uncle Liu:''' Ah, just reminiscing... Once you reach my age, kid, you find that remembering the past is more enjoyable than contemplating the future.
::'''Uncle Liu:''' For instance, these days I keep finding myself thinking back to the way my next-door neighbor, [[Shuzhi]], used to look in the prime of her youth...
::'''Uncle Liu:''' Ah, the way I'd crouch behind the window and peek out at her... Sometimes she'd see me... even shot me a smile sometimes...
::'''Uncle Liu:''' Boy, I'll never forget her smile. The dimples on her cheeks... that look in her eyes, like the smile was for me, and me alone...
::{{DIcon}} And? Where did it go from there?
::'''Uncle Liu:''' Where did it go? ...What on earth do you mean?
::'''Uncle Liu:''' ...You don't seriously think I... told her the way I felt!?
::'''Uncle Liu:''' Wh&mdash;What is wrong with you? You honestly think a guy should just... straight up tell a girl how they feel!?
::'''Uncle Liu:''' Tut-tut, you kids these days... Where's your sense of shame...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Uncle Liu:''' You're only young once, kid. Don't end up like me... with nothing left but memories...
