==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Anna has a chronic illness that makes her very sickly. In the belief that there is a fairy in the fountain that can grant wishes, she often throws coins in. Her older brother, [[Anthony]], works hard to pay for medicine, as do her parents.

In the commission ''[[Miracle Medicine]]'', Anthony requests the help of the [[Traveler]] in gathering the ingredients for a special prescription for Anna, given to him by a [[Baizhu|renowned doctor]] in Liyue.

Anna then recovers in the follow-up commission ''[[Recuperating From a Severe Illness]]''. In contrast to her time spent convalescing at home, she gained a lot of energy since her recovery. She traverses grounds that would require much agility, such as the top of the [[Favonius Cathedral|Cathedral]], on top of a windmill, or in the hands of the [[Barbatos]] statue. She even considers becoming a nun or applying for the [[Adventurers' Guild]].

Anna begins studying and training to join the Adventurers' Guild in the commission [[Adventurer Exam: Battle Tactics]], despite her brother's worries, and she eventually becomes an official adventurer in [[Anna the Adventurer!]]

===Personality===
Anna is an optimistic young woman who once sincerely hoped to get well so she wouldn't be a burden on her family. She may be slightly superstitious since she wholeheartedly believes that the blessings of the fountain fairy helped cure her illness. After recuperating from her severe illness, she became energetic, always wanting to explore around the city. After deciding to take the Adventurer Exam, she admits to wanting to learn how to battle with monsters out in the wild but is still scared when they are too close. Although at times exasperated by her brother's nagging, she is grateful for his constant care and wishes to fulfill some of his dreams too.

===Appearance===
Anna has long red hair and blue eyes. She wears a traditional Mondstadt women's attire consisting of a white and green blouse with detached sleeve and adorned with a red ribbon, a bodice with a loose belt, bloomers, and short boots. After completing [[Anna the Adventurer!]], she is seen wearing the  standard Adventurers' Guild female uniform.

==Dialogue==
===Before Curing Anna===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Anna:''' Hi. Is there something *coughs* I can do for you? *coughs*
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(Unlocked after [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Anna:''' *cough* To tell the truth, I made a wish to the fountain fairy when the dragon attacked, wishing that it would keep Mondstadt safe.
::'''Anna:''' Now, both the storm and the danger has passed. Does that mean that the fountain fairy truly exists?
::'''Anna:''' I wish that the fairy can make me well soon &mdash; that would lessen my family's burden a little... *cough*
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Anna:''' I am... *coughs* making a wish.
::'''Anna:''' I just toss the coin *coughs* into the pool just like this, and *coughs* make a wish...
::'''Anna:''' You must be *coughs* sincere and do it every day for the fountain fairy to hear you... *coughs*
::'''Anna:''' I'm sorry... I can't stop coughing...
::{{DIcon}} What do you want?
:::'''Anna:''' Oh... I've been *coughs* unwell for a long time.
:::'''Anna:''' I wish that *coughs* the fountain fairy could help me *coughs* get better.
:::'''Anna:''' So I can stop *coughs* being a burden to my parents and my *coughs* brother Anthony.
::{{DIcon}} Can't your family help you?
:::'''Anna:''' My parents and my *coughs* brother Anthony have all been *coughs* really good to me...
:::'''Anna:''' Anthony works tirelessly every night
:::'''Anna:''' just to *coughs* earn money to buy medicine for me.
:::'''Anna:''' I... also want to do something for them. *coughs*
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Anna:''' Be well.
::'''Anna:''' I hope *coughs* all your wishes will be granted soon... *coughs*
{{Dialogue end}}

===After Curing Anna ===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Anna:''' Thanks to Anthony and the blessings of the fountain fairy, I've been getting better...
:{{DIcon}} You haven't made a full recovery yet?
::'''Anna:''' Not yet. I still cough at times, but I'm much better than before.
::'''Anna:''' I want to get well soon... That way, I won't burden Anthony and the others any further.
::'''Anna:''' I'd also be able to do some things that I want to do as well.
:{{DIcon}} The fountain fairy?
::'''Anna:''' Yes. I heard from Anthony that he was able to get a prescription from Liyue Harbor.
::'''Anna:''' To think that he was able to get a prescription from such a distant place so smoothly... the fountain fairy might have heard my wishes after all.
::'''Anna:''' She must have protected Anthony and helped him to obtain that prescription.
::'''Anna:''' Once I've made a fully recovery, I must make a trip to [[Springvale]]...
:{{DIcon}} See you, and get well soon.
::'''Anna:''' Goodbye. My wishes have been granted, and I hope that yours will soon come true as well.

:{{DIcon}} How've you been lately?
::'''Anna:''' Ah, Traveler! It's you!
::'''Anna:''' I've been taking my progress as an adventurer quite... slowly.
::'''Anna:''' I've completed some escort missions, more escort missions... Have I mentioned the other escort missions?
::'''Anthony:''' And she's very good at them, too.
::'''Anthony:''' As I see it, she's already an expert at these commissions.
::'''Anna:''' Brother! I've done this escort so many times already! I'm looking for something more exciting!
::'''Anthony:''' Come on, Anna. Everything in good time.
::'''Anna:''' Ugh...
:{{DIcon}} How have you been feeling Anna?
::'''Anna:''' Me? I'm feeling great! In fact, I feel almost indefatigable!
::'''Anthony:''' Something that's shown through in your appetite.
::'''Anna:''' Brother! I... I'm only eating a bit more than I used to, come on!
::'''Anna:''' Don't you pin this on me by the way. This is your fault for making the food so delicious!
::'''Anthony:''' And what would you like to have for dinner tonight?
::'''Anna:''' Sweet Madame, Pancakes... and Chicken-Mushroom Skewer! And, and... Let me think...
