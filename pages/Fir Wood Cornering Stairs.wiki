|description    = A cornering stair made from fir wood. This one is of the same make as the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters#Library|Favonius Library]]'s staircase, having large flat handrails. Though some have already used the library's handrails as slides to play on, do take note of your weight when attempting to follow that precedent.
