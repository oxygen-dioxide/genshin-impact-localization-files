==Profile==
Najib is a member of [[the Eremites]] who is currently near [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]], and is one of the three most recent witnesses of the [[Shaggy Sumpter Beast|Sumpter Beastlord]]. He claims he is traveling to [[Liyue]] from [[Sumeru]] and managed to sneak by the creature while it was sleeping. However, he becomes defensive when asked why he is traveling through the more dangerous land route through The Chasm instead of going over water, claiming personal reasons.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where Are the Fierce Creatures?}}</ref>

Najib is actually working with [[Treasure Hoarders]] in the region and has given them the location of a [[chest]] buried in the hills of [[Avidya Forest]], near The Chasm.<ref>NPC Dialogue: [[Avidya Forest#Dialogue|Treasure Hoarder Member]]<br>''I thought that Najib guy said that there'd be no one around! Darn it, no one in the Eremites is reliable!''</ref>

===Appearance===
Najib wears the tan clothes and red scarf and headband of a [[Eremite Ravenbeak Halberdier]]. He has brown hair.
