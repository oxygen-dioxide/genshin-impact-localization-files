{{Quest Description|[[Ooshima Junpei]], who works at the [[Asase Shrine]], seems to be bothered by something...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Huh, how did I run out of wood...
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Oh, hey there, Traveler! You're just the person I was hoping to see. Do you mind doing me a favor?
:{{DIcon}} What's that?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' I've been trying to make smaller-scale wood carvings of our provisional head priestess.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' I've been thinking to bring a batch of these to Narukami Island to see if they'll sell...
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' If they do, they would make for a source of consistent income for me.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, I think they'll sell alright.
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Hahaha. Thanks for your well-wishes.
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' That said, I think I've got faith in our Lady Neko's charisma.
:{{DIcon}} What's with the wood carvings all of a sudden?
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Oh, well... Do you know what my payment from our head priestess has been so far?
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' They're generally these... bottles, cups, plates, and things like that.
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' They do look a bit old, but when I went to have them appraised, we found out that these things are in fact a bit "ancient"... and valuable, too.
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' But to tell the truth, it was pretty troublesome and tiring getting them sold every time.
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Also, this really doesn't make for a particularly stable income... If the head priestess were to run out of these things one day, wouldn't that basically put me out of a job?
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' As such, I've decided to pursue a new business venture.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Well, never mind that for now. Let's talk about the matter at hand...
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' So, the issue is that I'm running out of the wood I was using to practice.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Could you help me collect 10 blocks of Otogi Wood, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' I'll leave it to you, then. You're a really great help.
:{{DIcon}} Do you really need that many?
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Well, I've only just started practicing, so it's best to be on the safe side and prepare more material.
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Well, I'm counting on you, Traveler.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Bring those Otogi Wood blocks to me once you're done.
----
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Have you found those 10 blocks of Otogi Wood?

;(Give 10 blocks of Otogi Wood)
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Hmm, yes, these will do, I think. Sorry for asking you to help after you came all this way to reach the shrine... Please take these.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Once I've gotten my wood-carving act together, I'll also send you my best work!
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Hmm, what pose should I carve for the provisional head priestess in this time...
