===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''[[A Fuel Named "Fate"]]'' and again after completing ''[[When All Becomes a Monument]]''.''{{Verify}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tairona:''' Should I go to [[Mualani]]'s store to check out the new surfboards...
:{{DIcon}} And can't you go have a look?
::'''Tairona:''' I can... and can't.
::'''Tairona:''' If you asked me whether I wanted to go, the answer would be an unequivocal yes.
::'''Tairona:''' But if you were to ask my wallet whether it could afford the trip, the answer would be "probably not."
::'''Tairona:''' And if you were to ask my house, it would argue that it could make better use of the Mora by building yet another storage extension.
::'''Tairona:''' I... I should respect their opinions too, right?
::{{DIcon}} Why don't you consider your "work" again?
::'''Tairona:''' Ah, that's right! Once I enter Mualani's shop, I wouldn't be able to leave. That would mean I would also no longer be able to work. That's a perfectly valid point.
::'''Tairona:''' ...But if we were to look at it that way, then in the interest of fairness, shouldn't I also pose the question to my other hobbies?
::'''Tairona:''' I've got a lot of hobbies, you know. Surfing, kayaking, swimming, water polo...
::'''Tairona:''' If I were to also count their votes, then the final vote would probably be very different.
::'''Tairona:''' Hmm... Guess I'll do a more comprehensive count of the votes later. This will be a problem for future me...
:{{DIcon}} Seeya.
::'''Tairona:''' Take care. I'm going to dwell on my dilemma some more...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available between completing ''[[A Fuel Named "Fate"]]'' and ''[[When All Becomes a Monument]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tairona:''' Should I go to [[Mualani]]'s store to check out the new surfboards...
:{{DIcon}} Are you out on patrol?
::'''Tairona:''' That's correct. Reconstruction work within the tribe has pretty much all been handed out, so [[Amina|the chief]] assigned me to patrol the area nearby instead.
::'''Tairona:''' According to the [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]], we gave the [[Abyss Order|Abyss]] a thorough thrashing this time, so there shouldn't be any more major disturbances in the short term. But they are cunning enemies, so we must stay vigilant.
::'''Tairona:''' So hobbies and whatnot will just have to be set aside for now. As the bearer of an [[Ancient Name]], I'm sure Miss Mualani must have plenty to keep her busy too!
:{{DIcon}} You'll get a chance some day.
::'''Tairona:''' I'm sure you're right!
