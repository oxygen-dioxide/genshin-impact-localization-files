* If you quit in the middle of the voyage, current progress will not be saved. Any Shimmering Shells salvaged this round will not be added to your inventory during evaluation.
* There are so many nice things underwater... but treasure this shiny and sparkling will definitely fetch a great price!
* The [[Chubby|Teapot Traveling Salesman]] may sometimes find Underwater Rarities, too. You can exchange for them if you have any extra Shimmering Shells.
* When at sea, there's a chance you can salvage Underwater Rarities. Collect all five types to obtain additional rewards.
* Paimon heard [[Cloud Retainer]] is bringing her supreme cuisine machine. Ooh, let's look forward to it!
* If Mr. [[Zhongli]] agrees to being our preparation consultant, the [[adepti]] will definitely enjoy this [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]].
* Tubby has also prepared a lucky draw chest filled with Liyue specialties. When the adepti arrive, let's try our luck together.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Paimon:'''  [[Traveler]]~ Another Lantern Rite is upon us!
:'''Traveler:''' Does [[Paimon]] still miss the taste of Lantern Rite's dishes?
:'''Paimon:''' Yes! Lantern Rite has sooo many delicious Liyue dishes~
:'''Traveler:''' However, food tastes better when it's shared with others. For such an auspicious festival as Lantern Rite, if it's just me and Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! What do you mean "if it's just me and Paimon"? Isn't Paimon your best travel companion?
:'''Traveler:''' Why don't we invite the adepti to the [[Serenitea Pot]]? Let them experience the joy of this year's Lantern Rite!
:'''Paimon:''' But... maybe it isn't suitable to invite the adept to such an empty Serenitea Pot.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, why don't we go out to sea? There might be some valuable treasure at the bottom of the sea.
:'''Paimon:''' Also... maybe we can salvage lost pieces of the [[Jade Chamber]]. That way, we can bring them to Lady [[Ningguang]] and get paid!
:'''Traveler:''' So, how do we host and entertain the adepti in the Serenitea Pot? Any ideas, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon is the best travel guide in all of Teyvat, but ummm... when it comes to hosting the adepti and giving them a fun-filled Lantern Rite, Paimon has no idea!
:'''Traveler:''' Why don't we ask Zhongli?
:'''Traveler:''' If we can get Zhongli to give us advice, we'll definitely be able to give [[Liyue]]'s adepti a Lantern Rite to remember in the Serenitea Pot!
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! Zhongli knows more about Liyue's tradition than anyone else we know! With him around, Paimon doesn't think we need to worry!
:'''Paimon:''' But... But maybe we shouldn't consult him where money is concerned!

|Gigantic Noctilucous Jade
|A piece of Noctilucous Jade the size of Paimon. I get the point, but why does it have to be so big? Why not make a life-size sculpture of Paimon with it?
|-
|[[File:TGBA Pot.png|100px]]
|Empty Vessel
|A vessel that was once used to store valuables on the shelves of the Jade Chamber. It must have held a lot of Mora and treasures! Such a shame that it's all gone now...
|-
|[[File:TGBA Scribing Tools.png|100px]]
|Simple Brush and Inkstone
|A brush and inkstone used by the people of Liyue. Traveler, why don't you use them to draw Paimon?
|-
|[[File:TGBA Teapot.png|100px]]
|Special Teapot Set for Listening to Stories
|A white teapot set that still shines brightly after washing away the silt from the bottom of the sea.<br>It's actually still a complete set! Why don't you use it for tea the next time you listen to a story?
|-
|[[File:TGBA Vase.png|100px]]
|Jade Chamber Vase That "Escaped"
|It sunk into the sea along with the Jade Chamber after the epic battle against Osial. Yet, it remains intact and elegant as before. There is no doubt that intricacy is a way of life.
