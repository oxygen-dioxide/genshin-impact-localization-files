Energy Recharge is the percentage increase of [[Energy]] regenerated by each elemental particle and elemental orb that is absorbed. Sources that directly give energy such as [[The Exile]] artifact set are not affected. You can increase Energy Recharge by equipping [[artifacts]] or [[weapons]] with the Energy Recharge % attribute. Additionally, some characters, such as [[Venti]], gain Energy Recharge with their ascensions. A few talents and constellations increase Energy Recharge as well.
