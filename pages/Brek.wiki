{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Brek:''' I was forced to do this in order to make a living. My hands were tied.
:{{DIcon}} What are you talking about?
::'''Brek:''' You scared me! I thought it was another creditor coming for me.
::'''Brek:''' I'm thinking of starting a new business. If this deal goes through, I'll be sitting atop a goldmine. I'll have enough [[Mora]] to leave the [[Court of Fontaine]] and start anew.
::'''Brek:''' But that cowardly [[Debal]]... Bah! He deserves to be poor. He couldn't hold onto Mora even if you handed it to him on a silver platter.
::{{DIcon}} Leave? But what about your creditors?
:::'''Brek:''' They really took me for a ride with this loan. When I borrowed that sum, I had no idea they'd come up with so many terms and charge me interest that was sky high.
:::'''Brek:''' If I were only expected to pay back the principal, I wouldn't exactly be overjoyed, but I could accept it. But now they're telling me that the interest alone has grown to three times the principal!
:::'''Brek:''' If they think I'm gonna pay that, they're delusional. I was hoodwinked. This was never my debt to begin with!
:::{{DIcon}} Then why did you borrow Mora in the first place?
:::'''Brek:''' I was in dire need of Mora for my business at the time, but no one was willing to lend me a cent. I had no choice but to approach that bunch of crooks for a small loan.
:::'''Brek:''' It doesn't matter now anyway. Once I get my hands on that thing and send it out, all of this will be settled.
::{{DIcon}} So... what exactly is this business?
:::'''Brek:''' Hmph, I can't tell you unless... you're willing to join me.
:::'''Brek:''' I can give you a little hint though. It was a deal with a prominent merchant from [[Snezhnaya]]. He struck the deal with me personally, hehehe.
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Brek:''' Goodbye for now. Those creditors shouldn't be able to find me here, right?
