A '''Weapon Series''' is a set of 2 to 5 weapons of same quality and different weapon type that share some or all of the features below:
*Identical main attributes and/or ability bonus
*Similar naming convention
*Related lore descriptions
Some weapon series' weapons will also share the following, though these are only considered in conjunction with the above features:
*Similar visual theme
*Same method of acquisition

All weapon series are considered unofficial in that their names and weapons have never been officially released and have instead been determined by players, with the exception of a few weapons that have been noted to be part of the same series during [[Special Program]]s.
