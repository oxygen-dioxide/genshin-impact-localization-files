'''''The Millennial Mountains''''' is a [[World Quest]] in [[The Chasm's Maw]], [[Liyue]].

==Steps==
Talk to [[Wang]], located east of the Teleport Waypoint at The Chasm's Maw, to start the quest. (See [[#Gameplay Notes|Gameplay Notes]] for details.)

# Look for offerings to place before the memorial (0/6)
#* All items can be obtained before starting this quest.
#* '''[[Flower of Farsight]]:''' Climb the mountains behind the Statue of The Seven using the chasm rocks to boost your jumps. Investigate the rock and you will find [[Tang Wuchou]]. Collecting the Flower of Farsight will automatically start the world quest ''[[A Cliff-Side Hero's Past]]''.
#* '''[[Skyfeather]]:''' Found at the cliff of [[Glaze Peak]]. Teleport to [[Tiangong Gorge]] and go over to Glaze Peak.
#* '''[[Cup of Commons]]:''' Open the Precious Chest from the World Quest ''[[Undetected Infiltration]]''.
#* '''[[Sundial of Ages]]:''' Found by heading northwest of [[The Surface]]'s teleport waypoint. Investigate the bowl and you will get the item.
#* '''[[Helm of Warding]]:''' Located in The Chasm's Maw. Follow a nearby [[Seelie]] into the wooden house and down the hole, then enter the next room over. Burn the hay using {{color|Pyro}} or the nearby [[Exploding Barrel]]s to reveal two investigation points, one of which yields the Helm of Warding.
#* '''[[Warrior's Spear]]:''' Head to the The Chasm's Maw waypoint and go to the mountain southeast from it. Climb to the top and the spear will be there along with two Sweet Flowers.
# Offer the items before the memorial
# Obtain the [[Millelith]]'s treasure
#* There is one [[Luxurious Chest]] and a full set of 4{{Star}} [[Tenacity of the Millelith]] artifacts.
# Talk to Wang about the treasure

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing this quest will award the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[The Millelith Shall Never Be Moved]]''.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|According to a local legend at [[The Chasm]], one may be able to obtain the "treasure of the Millelith" by offering six items before a memorial.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Wang:''' O great Millelith heroes, please see to it that The Chasm does not act up these few days!
:'''Wang:''' And may we be safe and sound as we descend into the mines this time, and may those comrades of ours who no longer come to mine also fare well in their respective paths. Protect us, brave Millelith, protect us...
:'''Wang:''' Hmm? What is it? Can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} You're praying to this thing?
:{{DIcon}} What is this thing?
:'''Wang:''' Well, I'm praying at this Millelith memorial. I mean, it looks like a pile of unassuming rocks, but it's actually been here for five hundred years now!
:'''Wang:''' The Chasm is under the protection of the Millelith, so every time we have people descend into the mines, we will pray here for the heroic souls of those who have passed to protect us.
:'''Wang:''' They have long since turned into elements and become one with the mine, so when we pray for their protection, we're also showing our reverence to The Chasm itself, you know?
:'''Wang:''' The ancients said that "the earth has a spirit, and the elements have souls." Those who sacrificed their lives so that we might live watch over us in similar fashion. So I believe...
:'''Paimon:''' Five hundred years ago?
:'''Wang:''' That's right. Back then, a dark calamity swallowed The Chasm, and Rex Lapis commanded the Millelith to stand guard over the ore veins.
:'''Wang:''' That was a terrible battle. Led by a [[Yaksha]], the Millelith came forth to stem the tide.
:'''Wang:''' In the end, a group of them led the foe into the depths of The Chasm, and thus quelled the unrest.
:'''Wang:''' It is said that this memorial was set up for them.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Paimon didn't think that these ugly stones would have such history…
:'''Wang:''' Hehe, don't disrespect the fallen, little one.
:{{DIcon}} Don't you worry, this little one won't bite.
::'''Paimon:''' Who's a "little one"!?
:{{DIcon}} Indeed, disrespecting the fallen is bad manners.
::'''Paimon:''' Um, sorry...
:'''Wang:''' Hehe, whatever the case, this is a pretty familiar story to anyone who grew up around The Chasm as we did… There are many versions of the tale, too, which sprung up over time.
:'''Wang:''' If you were to talk to someone else, they might tell you a different story. Maybe this is the charm of history? Not that I'm particularly cultured, mind, but I'm just saying, y'know?
:'''Wang:''' Ah, yeah, speaking of which, there's always been a rumor going about. It says that these stones hide another secret that might lead a discerning person to treasure that the Millelith left behind.
:'''Paimon:''' Treasure that they left behind?
:'''Paimon:''' Could you give us some details? Let's just say that… Paimon's interest has been piqued!
:'''Wang:''' Eh, it's just a rumor, but it's one that's got to do with the Millelith member who created this memorial in the first place.
:{{DIcon}} Didn't the miners set this memorial up?
::'''Wang:''' Nah. The one that the miners set up is elsewhere, and it isn't anywhere as large as this one.
:{{DIcon}} So this was the work of a Millelith soldier?
:'''Wang:''' Indeed, both the Millelith and the miners at The Chasm set memorials up back then.
:'''Wang:''' The battle ended, but many of their comrades now rest eternally in the depths of The Chasm, together with that [[Bosacius|nameless Yaksha]]…
:'''Wang:''' One of the soldiers fell from a great height while helping to evacuate the miners and beat back the enemy, injuring his spine and becoming unable to move on his own power as a result...
:'''Wang:''' But later, it is said that he was not daunted by his circumstances, instead becoming a self-taught and much-famed doctor who would help those in the same situation as himself.
:'''Wang:''' It is said that this memorial was something he set up to remember his comrades by after he had obtained a Vision.
:'''Wang:''' His story would gradually fade from history, being replaced with tales of the "Millelith's treasure" and the "Yaksha's inheritance."
:'''Wang:''' Those are just baseless tales. We miners generally prefer to keep our feet firmly planted, so I don't give much credence to these tales. Still...
:'''Paimon:''' Still?
:'''Wang:''' No, it's nothing, I just mean that I won't laugh if you do actually go looking for that treasure.
:'''Wang:''' I've given it some thought, and it occurred to me that while the tales of treasure might all be false, they exist as a way for generations of people to ensure that stories are passed down and not forgotten by later generations.
:'''Wang:''' Whatever the case, the one who offers up six items lost within The Chasm before this stone will be awarded the gifts of the Millelith &mdash; that's how the story goes.
:'''Wang:''' And these six items are...
:'''Wang:''' The [[Helm of Warding]], which may defend one from rockfalls...
:'''Wang:''' The [[Cup of Commons]], made to memorialize comradeship...
:'''Wang:''' The [[Skyfeather]], the symbol of lofty ideals...
:'''Wang:''' The [[Warrior's Spear]], used to fend off the foe...
:'''Wang:''' The "[[Flower of Farsight]]," which grew upon the cliffs of The Chasm...
:'''Wang:''' And... the "[[Sundial of Ages]]," used to remember bygone past.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that wasn't confusing at all, no sir!
:'''Paimon:''' You sure this wasn't all made up by people later?
:{{DIcon}} So these items can all be found within The Chasm?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds dubious to me...
:'''Wang:''' I've got no clue. Maybe they were all made up &mdash; that would certainly explain why no one's found the legendary treasure this whole time!
:'''Wang:''' Ah, yes, speaking of which... There was another memorial that I mentioned, yes? *sigh* Everyone's just busied themselves with their own separate things after The Chasm was close. No one's kept that place clean, I'll bet.
:'''Wang:''' Could you help me go over there and just tidy the place up? Just a little will do...
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|To obtain the Millelith's treasure, you must offer six objects up: the Flower of Farsight, the Skyfeather, the Sundial of Ages, the Cup of Commons, the Helm of Warding, and the Warrior's Spear. If you don't know where to find them, perhaps it might help to ask Wang, the miner at the memorial.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Wang again. Each item's dialogue option is removed if already found)
:'''Wang:''' The items you need to find are the Helm, the Feather, the Cup, the Sundial, the Flower, and the Spear.
:'''Wang:''' That said, no one's found them all to this day, so...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the "Flower of Farsight."<!--This is the only one with quotation marks in-game-->
:;(Camera pans to the Flower's general location)
::'''Wang:''' It is said that the Flower of Farsight will only make itself known to those with such lofty desires that they might seem crazy to some, and thus is not something ordinary people can witness. Hmm, I wonder what sort of flower that would be?
:;(Displays all dialogue options again)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Skyfeather.
:;(Camera pans to the Skyfeather's general location)
::'''Wang:''' I've heard that the Skyfeather can only be obtained from an eagle on a certain mountaintop. That said, never in all my years have I seen someone who can pluck a feather from an eagle...
:;(Displays all dialogue options again)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Sundial of Ages.
:;(Camera pans to the Sundial's general location)
::'''Wang:''' They say that the Sundial of Ages would be remembered by all, such that time's passage would not cause it to lose its luster. Perhaps it has never been forgotten or lost after all?
:;(Displays all dialogue options again)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Cup of Commons.
:;(Camera pans to the Cup's general location)
::'''Wang:''' I've heard it said that the Cup of Commons will regain its dignity someday, even if it is obtained by bandits and crooks, or becomes a lowly guest at a humble table... But what does that even mean?
:;(Displays all dialogue options again)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Helm of Warding.
:;(Camera pans to the Helm's general location)
::'''Wang:''' The Helm of Warding is said to rest in the room of an ordinary person, yet may not be summoned forth by anyone but a hero... Well, this was a story I used to fall asleep to, so...
:;(Displays all dialogue options again)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Warrior's Spear.
:;(Camera pans to the Spear's general location)
::'''Wang:''' The Warrior's Spear is rumored to have been set up on a lone cliff, awaiting a valiant soul equal to it. Only then will it be content to once again enter time's eternal flow... Hah, what an exaggerated legend...
:;(Displays all dialogue options again)
:{{DIcon}} See you...
::'''Wang:''' Yes, see you... But take care now. The Chasm is still quite a dangerous place.

;(Interact with the Memorial Stone)
:'''Memorial Stone:''' (Several rows of names of Millelith soldiers are carved into the memorial, and the following is inscribed below...)
:'''Memorial Stone:''' ..."With Liyue behind us, we fought bravely, warriors all — we feared death not, and not an inch did we yield."
:'''Memorial Stone:''' ..."We accomplished the task Rex Lapis gave us, and we did not betray the people's hopes — let this stone be our witness."
:'''Memorial Stone:''' ..."The years may erode all, yet the Millelith shall never be moved."
{{Dialogue end}}

===Find the Six Items===
====Flower of Farsight====
{{main|A Cliff-Side Hero's Past#Dialogue}}
====Skyfeather====
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the cliff where the [[Skyfeather]] is located)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, the wind's real strong this high up. So, this is where eagles rest, huh?

;(Obtain the Skyfeather)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, there's a single feather here...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks this might be of use later. We should keep it!
{{Dialogue end}}

====Sundial of Ages====
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Obtain the Sundial of Ages)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Why's this old sundial been left here?
:'''Paimon:''' Did someone drop it?
{{Dialogue end}}

====Cup of Commons====
{{See also|Undetected Infiltration#Dialogue}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Open the Precious Chest and obtain the Cup of Commons)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, this stone cup doesn't look like anything special.
:'''Paimon:''' But why would the Treasure Hoarders hide this cup in a treasure chest?
{{Dialogue end}}

====Helm of Warding====
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Interact with ''A Piece of Paper'', optional)
:'''A Piece of Paper:''' "Didn't they say that some Helm of Warding thing was left here by the Millelith? We've been here all day, and there's nothing to show for it!"
:'''A Piece of Paper:''' ..."Aren't these just the hats that the miners use? What Helm of Warding? You sure the intel you got was accurate?"
:'''A Piece of Paper:''' (The name of the writer, "[[Erge]]," has been roughly canceled and written again twice over. It seems that this person isn't too enamored of their own penmanship...)

;(Obtain the [[Helm of Warding]])
:'''???:''' Show yourself! I knew there was someone inside! Hmph... How ironic that Erge, who couldn't even find a helm, says my intel is wrong.
:'''???:''' Hand over the Helm of Warding! We've been keeping tabs on you, so don't try to play dumb!
:'''Paimon:''' Those are Treasure Hoarders at the gate... Are they looking for the Millelith's treasure as well?

;(Open the door and talk to [["The Qingce Kid"|???]], optional)
:'''???:''' Hey, you! Yes, you!
:'''???:''' Someone familiar with this place like you could find what that Erge lug couldn't, I'll bet.
:'''???:''' No? Well, I'll just wait for someone who can, make 'em find it, and get it off them.
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' They call me The Qingce Kid, and no measly motley of Chasm miners is going to stop me, or I'll never show my face again out there. Well then! Give me the thing.
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' We'll take the Millelith's treasure, thank you very much!
:{{DIcon}} I don't know what you're looking for...
:{{DIcon}} ...But you won't find it here.
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' And what you say goes, eh?
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' ...Hmph. You know, I thought all that running around would've made you look a bit tougher.
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' Well, I'll give you a choice. You can give me the Helm of Warding, or you can give it to me after I've knocked your lights out.
:{{DIcon}} ...I doubt you actually want to fight me.
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' Oh, look who's talking big?
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' Looks like you'll have to learn the hard way!
:;(After defeating "The Qingce Kid")
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' Ugh, I can't believe that I, "The Qingce Kid," would lose to a miner... G—Guess you've got a trick or two!
:'''"The Qingce Kid":''' This isn't over, you hear?
:'''Paimon:''' Pfft, seriously? So he thought we were miners who live around here...
{{Dialogue end}}

====Warrior's Spear====
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Obtain the Warrior's Spear)
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe this spear is a relic from that time!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Obtain the Treasure===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon:''' Look, (Traveler), a hole's opened up under that original rock pile!
:'''Paimon:''' So the Millelith treasure is real!

;(Read the Stone Tablet)
:'''Stone Tablet:''' (This small stone tablet has the following words inscribed on it...)
:'''Stone Tablet:''' ..."During the battle at The Chasm, I lost the use of my four limbs and thus was forced to dictate these words for someone else to record and carve here."...
:'''Stone Tablet:''' ..."I survived that fierce battle, but each night where I thought of our fallen comrades was a sleepless one. And with my body in this state, oh, how I detested the fact that I was not privileged to join them."...
:'''Stone Tablet:''' ..."I attempted to join them, only to have Rex Lapis hear of it and reprimand me, waking me from my stupor."...
:'''Stone Tablet:''' ..."Alas, for I can no longer make use of his gift of Millelith armor and equipment. They shall only accumulate dust if left in my keeping, and so I leave them here for someone fated to come and claim them."...
:'''Stone Tablet:''' ..."Everyone, though we can no longer do so in this life, let us be comrades again in the next. Let us then share the wine of sworn brotherhood once more, and defend Liyue from its foes!"...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Return to Wang===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Wang:''' Oh, wow, you really found it! So... this is the "treasure of the Millelith," then?
:'''Wang:''' Now, I've got no clue what's in there, but I'm sure that the soldier who left that treasure behind would be pleased to know that it was found.
:'''Wang:''' It's been five hundred years since that disaster... When I think about how this place was once the site of such an intense battle, one in which countless forebears of ours sacrificed themselves, I can't help but wonder...
:'''Wang:''' Did any of those people who went into battle alongside the Lord of Geo think that they would be remembered by people across the centuries?
:'''Wang:''' Did they ever doubt or falter in their duties? And as for those who never gained a Vision, how did they remain loyal to a god who never showed them favor, even until death?
:{{DIcon}} Their god never left their side.
:{{DIcon}} They were loyal to their own decisions as well.
:'''Wang:''' ...
:'''Wang:''' Yes, you're right. Those with Visions, those without... We are all working towards a future with limitless potential. I mean, that's what they call motivation, am I right?
:'''Wang:''' We're the same. We're not here for the good times in the past, or for some self-realization in the present... But we do this to support one another in leaving something of ourselves behind in the times we live in.
:'''Wang:''' Maybe someday in the far future, The Chasm will also become our memorial.
:'''Wang:''' The pits and the valleys, the sweat of generations of miners... They all bear witness to the tough road we have chosen.
:'''Wang:''' Just like this memorial, this place will be here a hundred, even a thousand years from now, as testament to the fact that the sacrifices made here were not in vain.
:'''Wang:''' Hehe, well, I'm not going to live to see that happen, obviously, but if someone does come here someday to toast us poor miners long after we're gone, that would be more than enough.

;(Talk to Wang again)
:'''Wang:''' O great Millelith heroes, please see to it that The Chasm does not act up these few days!
:'''Wang:''' And may we be safe and sound as we descend into the mines this time, and may those comrades of ours who no longer come to mine also fare well in their respective paths. Protect us, brave Millelith, protect us...
