:'''[[Navia]]:''' The banquet celebrating [[Poisson]]'s reconstruction is nearly ready! I just need to check everything over one last time...
:'''Navia:''' Oh no, looks like there aren't enough desserts. We'll have to make some more!
:'''Spina di Rosula Member:''' As you wish, Demoiselle!
----
:'''Navia:''' Why don't we start by grinding the almonds?

;(After grinding the almonds)
:'''Navia:''' Next, we need to beat the egg whites. I've got this!

;(After beating the egg whites)
:'''Navia:''' Given that tastes vary, we'll have to make Macarons with a variety of different sweetness levels.

;(Choose the amount of sugar)
:'''Navia:''' The flavor and color of the Macarons will depend on the ingredients we add. Hmm? There's even fresh Tidalga here!

;(Choose an ingredient)
:'''Navia:''' It's time to create a special design for the Macaron!

;(Choose a Macaron design)
:'''Navia:''' I can already imagine what it'll smell like when it's done! Get it in the oven, quick!

;(Obtain a Macaron)
:'''Navia:''' I knew it'd be more fun to make them myself! Let's keep going~
----
;(After making three Macarons)
:'''Navia:''' Everything is ready! You can send out the invitation letters now~
:'''Spina di Rosula Member:''' Of course. Leave that to us!
:'''Spina di Rosula Member:''' Demoiselle, who is that special invitation letter for?
:'''Navia:''' That's for my partners, of course! I'll be delivering this one myself.
:;(Navia appears in front of [[Hotel Debord]])
:'''Navia:''' This is your invitation~ Please come to the banquet celebrating Poisson's reconstruction!
:'''Navia:''' And here's a box of freshly-made Macarons for you. Go on, give them a try!

==Navia's Remarks==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If no sugar was added)
:If it isn't sweet, can it still be called a Macaron?

;(If a bit of sugar was added)
:You can just about taste a hint of sweetness if you really focus.

;(If a half serving of sugar was added)
:Seems like the healthy choice.

;(If a full serving of sugar was added)
:The amount of sugar is perfect. It's the classic level of sweetness.

;(If extra servings of sugar were added)
:Ugh! The sweetness is utterly overpowering... Tea, where's my tea...

;(If Berry was added)
:Berries, one of the vital ingredients when making Jam. Perfect choice!

;(If Tomato was added)
:Mmm, the rich flavor of Tomato... I just can't stop myself! Actually, that's a thought &mdash; have we got any fries?

;(If Lavender Melon was added)
:What a miraculous texture! Combined with its unique design, I can tell this one's going to be a hit!

;(If Bulle Fruit was added)
:The filling is a delightful mix of sweet and sour, and the color of the exterior is mouthwateringly enticing!

;(If Tidalga was added)
:Well I never thought I'd get the chance to make a dessert with Tidalga, but that's one that I won't be trying myself, haha...
