{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Trudaine:''' Have you heard? It seems that new fabrics have arrived at [[Chioriya Boutique]]. I heard that from my husband &mdash; he's a well-informed one, he is.
:'''Graciette:''' Really? Well, my husband knows that too. He's helped me pre-order them, too. Would you like me to send you a share?
:'''Trudaine:''' Oh, that's fine. I'll just keep observing the product &mdash; a decision can come later.
:'''Trudaine:''' Oh, and by the way, the limited edition perfume I bought previously is coming in soon. Would you like some? I can lend it to you.
:'''Graciette:''' Well, I just so happen to have one of those myself. It's one of Ms. [[Emilie]]'s, isn't it? They tell me that there aren't a lot of them this time, and that they're selling out before they can even hit shelves!
:'''Trudaine:''' My, oh my, as expected of a merchant family, I suppose. If I miss any seasonal specials next time, I suppose I'll need you to help me out.
:'''Graciette:''' Oh, it's nothing. I mean, will we not still have to rely on that judge of yours in matters of importance?
