: {{DIcon|Idle}} The best stone...
:: {{A|VO Shushan 01.ogg}} "Even the best stone isn't much unless you've got a good stone mason."

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shushan:''' I have to think of a way to find some young people who will seriously learn the craft of masonry...
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]])
::'''Shushan:''' Chenyu Vale is full of noteworthy treasures... But in my opinion, the jade and ores are the most precious.
::'''Shushan:''' I stumbled upon an area rich in ores while on a stroll the other day. There were even some high-quality crystals with a brilliant blue hue amongst them...
::'''Shushan:''' Qiaoying Village is in no way lacking ores right now, so feel free to take a look for any you might need...
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]])
::'''Shushan:''' Hmm... The sights are lovely around here. Take in all in slowly if you're interested...
:{{DIcon}} You are?
::'''Shushan:''' Hmm? Why, aren't you an intelligent-looking youngster?
::'''Shushan:''' I'm Shushan. The trustiest stonemasons of Chenyu Vale have come from my family for generations now, ever since the time of my ancestors.
::'''Shushan:''' Many of the local stone buildings were build by my family.
::'''Shushan:''' Even after retiring, I still haven't found an apprentice worthy of inheriting my skills...
:{{DIcon}} Craftmanship?
::'''Shushan:''' The craftmanship of cutting and transporting stones, the techniques required to carve on stone surfaces... These are only some of the many things a stonemason needs to learn to perfect their craft.
::'''Shushan:''' There's not only jade to be found around here. All manner of high-quality stone lie in this vale, the best materials for building roads and houses.
::'''Shushan:''' I'm not the only stonemason around these parts, but I'm sure everyone would want their family craft, passed down from generation to generation, to continue shining brightly.
::'''Shushan:''' Am I wrong?
:{{DIcon}} Young people, you say?
::'''Shushan:''' You need skill and stamina to work with stone. Your body won't be able to cope unless you start training from a young age.
::'''Shushan:''' But some youngsters are too eager for success and end up taking the wrong path...
::'''Shushan:''' After learning some fancy skills from elsewhere, they carve and polish pure white stone to make mementos, which they sell to outsiders...
::'''Shushan:''' Such things are nice to keep as a souvenir if reasonably priced, but they're not worth it at all if they're too expensive.
::'''Shushan:''' After all, ordinary stone is not the equal of jade. It should be used to build ordinary houses, roads, and bridges.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Shushan:''' Take care.
