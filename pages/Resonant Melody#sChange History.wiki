[[Version 2.3]]
* Updated the description to reference the Resonant Melody as a harp rather than a lyre:
** {{Color|Old parts of description:}}
*** A uniquely designed {{Highlight|lyre}}
*** All one needs to do is touch {{Highlight|the lyre}}
*** This {{Highlight|lyre}} may seem like a mere decoration
** {{Color|New parts of description:}}
*** A uniquely designed {{Highlight|harp}}
*** All one needs to do is touch {{Highlight|its strings}}
*** This {{Highlight|instrument}} may seem like a mere decoration
