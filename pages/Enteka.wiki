==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Enteka:''' Welcome. A good cup of coffee will keep you energized all day.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What have you got here?
::'''Enteka:''' Are you found of desserts? We have some that go very well with coffee. Please, feel free to try some!
:;(Opens the Puspa Café Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Enteka:''' This is Puspa Café, and I'm the acting manager here.
::'''Enteka:''' If you're a first-time customer, why don't you tell me what your preferences are? Then I can recommend a coffee that will suit your tastes.
::'''Enteka:''' Do you like your coffee sweet, or do you prefer it more on the bitter side? Stronger or milder?
::'''Enteka:''' Whatever your preferences, no matter how offbeat, I can make something to your liking.
:{{DIcon}} About [[Gata|that cat]]...
::'''Enteka:''' Ah, you must have spotted Gata.
::'''Enteka:''' Gata's not even a year old yet so she's still a very curious kitty. Whenever I read people's fortunes from the coffee grounds, she'll jump up to watch.
::'''Enteka:''' If you'd like, you can give her head a good pat. She'll get happy and start purring, and you'll get to enjoy the softest feeling in the world.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Yay, woohoo!
:::'''Enteka:''' Haha, looks like you are a cat lover, too.
:::'''Enteka:''' Here's a tip for you, my friend! Gata prefers [[Fowl]] to [[Fish]].
:::'''Enteka:''' If Gata eats the Fowl you feed her, then she must be willing to be your friend!
::;(Obtain [[Fowl]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Enteka:''' Take care, hope to see you again.
