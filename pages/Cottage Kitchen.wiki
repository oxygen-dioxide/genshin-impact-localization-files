|description    = A fully equipped kitchen with a cabinet full of carefully prepared seasonings.<br>Chefs seeking excellence will buy fresh ingredients from the market daily, and true culinary artists will even pay close attention to the firewood used in their stoves. The [[Xiangling|young head chef]] of [[Wanmin Restaurant]] once shared that to make the traditional dishes of [[Qingce Village]], one must first place dry bamboo chips into the stove and carefully control the flame. If one can process the shrubbery near [[Wolfhook]]s into thin firewood, one can even add a little [[Mondstadt]] flair in.<br>Different kinds of firewood produce vastly different effects, and most chefs will never truly master them. As such, Wanmin Restaurant has a monopoly on this particular technique.
