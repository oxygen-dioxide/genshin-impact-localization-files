==Summary==
Arriving at [[Inazuma]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] meet with [[Katheryne]] who tells them she has a commission for them. The commission was sent by [[Yae Miko]] and that they could find her at the [[Yae Publishing House]].

When they arrive, Yae dismisses her team for preparations before greeting the pair. She explains that she is organizing the Irodori Festival with an Inazuman twist as the [[Sakoku Decree]] had been lifted; her twist being to increase the reputation of her business. The festival gets Paimon's interest, prompting the Traveler to agree and go to [[Ritou]]. Once there, they run into [[Kamisato Ayato]], who's helping Miko with the festival. As the two are extremely busy, Ayato gives the Traveler [[Arrival Schedule|a ship log]] to help greet the incoming foreigners.

The next day, the Traveler arrives at the docks to greet the first ship from [[Mondstadt]]. Some bards initially come out, with and addition of [[Albedo]] invited to the festival and had taken [[Klee]] along as a dependent. The Traveler guides them to the [[International Trade Association]] when Albedo remarks that Mr. [[Hirayama]] is missing. He explains to the Traveler that he was supposed to be his contact for the Five Kasen. The Traveler then recalls that the editors would be at the [[Outlander Affairs Agency]] and takes him there.

At the agency, the editors are in panic and try to hide it from Albedo and the Traveler, but Albedo's deductions cause them to reveal what happened. The volume of the latest [[A Legend of Sword]] had gone missing, so the editors were intending to return to the city to print more copies to alleviate some of the impact. At the same time, the locals reported a suspicious individual running around a warehouse and called the [[Tenryou Commission]] to apprehend them. The two agree to help, being aware of Zhenyu's [[Xingqiu|real name]] and that he would be upset if the books were missing.

On their way to the warehouse, they find [[Kujou Sara]] caught [[Venti]] as a suspicious person entering illegally without his Invitation Pass. Venti explains that he was invited by Ayato, but had gotten too excited and boarded a ship sending booze to Inazuma when he passed out from excessive drinking and woke up to Sara glaring at him. Hirayama then asks Venti if he heard anyone in the warehouse, who tells him he didn't hear anything out of the ordinary, claims he only heard workers and Albedo concludes that whoever stole the books had their sights on them for a while, might have had insider access and worked in a group.

Sara agrees with Albedo's conclusion but reminds Venti he still needs to show his permit. The Traveler and Albedo quickly deduce that the permit is in Venti's hat, putting him in the clear. Venti then shows the two a paper regarding Suikou of the Five Kasen, giving Albedo inspiration to finish the painting after a meal. Venti then suggests waiting for the next paper and/or inspiration to come.
