'''Attendants''' refer to a [[Ley Line Disorder]] and [[Aura]] that designates one enemy (usually an [[Elite Enemies|Elite Enemy]] or [[Normal Boss]]) as a "leader" and other enemies as "attendants." The attendants will provide certain buffs to the leader. The leader and attendant will be marked with a green aura, with the leader being marked with a large circle and attendants being marked with a smaller circle connected to the leader by green lines.

==Domain of Heresy==
The Attendant aura appeared in the [[Energy Amplifier Initiation]] event (Domain of Heresy).<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/359229 Energy Amplifier Top Tips - "Domain of Heresy"]</ref>

==Effects==
When the Frostarm Lawachurl's HP has dropped to a certain point, opponents known as Attendants will appear and grant it several bonuses. Each Attendant will increase the Frostarm Lawachurl's Elemental RES and Physical RES by 10%. The Attendants will also heal it every 12s for 5% of its HP.<ref>{{Ref/Domain|Frost-Worn Space}}</ref>

Any good Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents has attendants to defend it. A new set of Attendants will be summoned at fixed intervals, replacing the previous group, and these Attendants will enhance the Abyss Herald's abilities. Each Attendant increases its Elemental RES and Physical RES by 10%. The Attendants will also heal it every 12s for 5% of its HP per Attendant. When there are no Attendants on the field, the Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents will lose the aforementioned enhancements and healing abilities. All Attendants will be destroyed when the Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents enters the Dark Descent state due to taking DMG, and they will not be summoned again.<ref>{{Ref/Domain|Twisted Realm}}</ref>
