==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Farzaneh:''' Hi there, can I help you with something? Please make it quick if you can. Standing too long in one place makes me dizzy...
:{{DIcon}} Do you need me to take you to the hospital?
::'''Farzaneh:''' Oh, it's not like that. I'm just not quite used to life on land yet.
::'''Farzaneh:''' I run an armed commercial shipping company. I used to serve as a lieutenant captain in [[Beidou]]'s [[Crux Fleet]], and made quite a bit of money doing so.
::'''Farzaneh:''' I haven't ventured back out to sea since starting my own commercial shipping company.
::'''Farzaneh:''' But I'm struggling to get used to being back on land, maybe because I spent so long at sea. I have to walk back and forth to avoid getting dizzy...
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Farzaneh:''' Then I'll get back to my walk.
