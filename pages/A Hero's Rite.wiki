;(Talk to Huni or Trinidad)<!--Verify if you can talk to Huni-->
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Huni! What were you thinking, going out by yourself? Don't you know how dangerous it is?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 01.ogg}} '''Huni:''' It's okay, Toba helped me, and... we met some kind strangers who helped us, and&mdash;
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 02.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' "Kind strangers"? What made you so sure they were so kind, hmm? I suppose they had "kind stranger" written on their foreheads?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 02.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Y&mdash;Yeah, actually, they did! In big bold letters!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 03.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Don't talk back to me! The Mountain King problem still hasn't been solved... What would I do if I lost you too? No dinner for you tonight!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 03.ogg}} '''Huni:''' They were good people, dad! Dinner or no dinner...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello again, Huni!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 04b.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Ah, it's Miss Paimon and {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}}! Dad, it's them! They're the ones who helped me... and I promised we'd take care of them if they came to visit...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 04.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Oh? So you're the "kind strangers," well...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 05.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' I'm Trinidad. Apparently, you helped my daughter today, so if there's anything you need, just ask. As an elder of the Scions of the Canopy, I've got some influence around here.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 06.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Now, I trust that you're sensible people, who know better than to take advantage of their host's generosity.
:{{DIcon}} We just happened to be passing by, so we lent her a hand. It was nothing.
::{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! Just helping a neighbor. We're not looking for anything in return.
::{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 07a 1.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Oh? Well, let's hope so...
:{{DIcon}} Of course. All we ask for is one million [[Mora]].
::{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 07b 1.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' One million Mora!? Hahaha! At least you're a straight-shooter. I can respect that much.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 05a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 05b.ogg}}--> '''Huni:''' Dad, please! They're not bad people! They've eaten at the same table with [[Kinich]] before. Be nice to them...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 08.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Kinich? Wait...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 09.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' I heard that two mysterious travelers from afar showed up at the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. Are they... you?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I'm one of them.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And Paimon's the other!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 10.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Ah... Ahem...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 11.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' ...I do apologize. A lot's been going on in our tribe lately, and I suppose the pressure must be getting to me, hehe... I can't believe I was so rude to you, I feel ashamed... *sigh* We got off on the wrong foot. Can we... start over?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, now we're talking! Seriously though, don't worry about it &mdash; already forgotten. We're just happy to see Huni got home safe and sound.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 12.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' You've just arrived, I take it? It would be my honor to give you a hero's welcome tonight.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Careful now, that's quite an about-face... We've heard that kind of thing can lead to spontaneous combustion around these parts.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 13.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' *cough*
:{{DIcon}} Save the VIP treatment. If you need a favor, let's talk.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 14.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Hah... My dear Traveler, you are very perceptive indeed!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 15.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Go inside now, Huni. Dad's got some important business to discuss.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo jnqlq002 1 huni 06b.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Okay. Look after {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}} and Miss Paimon, they're very special guests!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we'll hear you out, but we can't make any promises that we'll be able to help.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 16.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Ahem... This is a matter of utmost importance. Please, allow me to explain...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 17.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' For many years, our tribe has celebrated the [[Turnfire Night]]. It is a traditional ceremony among the Scions of the Canopy, in which we remember our ancestor, [[Burkina]], and his companion, [[Kongamato]] the Mountain King.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 18.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Burkina was a hero who bore the [[Ancient Name|ancient name]] {{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}, and Kongamato was a powerful [[yumkasaur]] warrior. Together, they fought against the [[Abyss]].

:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 19.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' They were victorious, but it came at a great cost... Burkina paid with his life. The Mountain King survived, but was contaminated by the Abyss, and he remains in hibernation to this day.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 20.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Normally, yumkasaurs never live longer than a century. It's possible that the Abyssal power is responsible for his unnaturally long lifespan.
:<gallery widths="350">
A Hero's Rite Quest Still 2.png
</gallery>
:{{DIcon}} Wait, so he's still alive?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 21.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' That's right. The Mountain King is a living symbol of our glory, but even this glory comes at a price.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 22.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' The Abyssal power inside him is highly sensitive, and when it is disturbed, he awakens and flies into a blind rage, attacking anything that moves...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 23.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' So, besides the ceremony, another important part of Turnfire Night each year is cleansing the Abyssal power inside the Mountain King, so that he will remain sound asleep.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 24.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' However, Abyss-related incidents have been on the rise in Natlan lately, as I'm sure you're both aware. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult to keep the Mountain King in hibernation.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 25.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Only five months have passed since the last Turnfire Night, and he's already showing signs of instability.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Has he woken up again?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 26.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' He has. We managed to contain the situation by performing a makeshift ceremony right away, but it was a close call. He could reawaken at any moment.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 27.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Also, he attacked and wounded my companion, [[Nanna]], during the ceremony... She became contaminated by the Abyss as a result, and...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We heard... Such a tragedy. We're really sorry for your loss.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 28.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' *sigh*... Yes, and Nanna wasn't the first...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 29.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Anyway, right now we're preparing for an exceptional Turnfire Night ceremony, and we need to find a suitable flame bearer. From what I've heard about your adventures, I believe you'd be perfect for the role.
:{{DIcon}} Don't you already have a flame bearer in the tribe?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 30.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Of course. Plus, he's a bona-fide hero who's inherited the {{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}} name.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean Kinich!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 31.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Yes, he's the one. A hero worth his weight in gold &mdash; and unfortunately for us, he's all too aware of that... No prizes for guessing what he said when I asked him to host a Turnfire Night outside of the annual schedule.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 32.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' "An exceptional ceremony? I'll have to charge an exceptional price." I swear, no other concept exists in that boy's brain...
:{{DIcon}} At least he's predictable. Fork over the Mora, and he's all yours.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like a professional adventurer to me.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 33.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' I'm not the one to usually talk about people behind their backs, but I'm convinced the [[Wayob]] got hit on the head and took a wrong turn the day it chose to give that ancient name to him. Have you ever heard of a hero whose mantra is "What's your asking price"?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 34.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Oh, and don't get me started on that insufferable [[Ajaw]] he hangs around with. Thinks he's god's gift to mankind! Pompous fool...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Paimon has to agree on that last part!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 35.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Anyway, the fact is, the ceremony can just as easily be done without him as long as we find someone else &mdash; and besides, you two seem like much better candidates. Hehe... So, what do you think?
:{{DIcon}} Just tell me what I need to do next.
:{{DIcon}} What's in it for me?
::{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 36b 1.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' You will gain the respect and friendship of the Scions of the Canopy. Something no amount of Mora can buy.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds good. It's a deal.
:{{DIcon}} Why don't I try to talk some sense into Kinich for you?
::{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 36c 1.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' There's only a few days left before the ceremony &mdash; we can't afford to waste what little time we have on negotiating with him. I'd much prefer if you would consider taking his place.
::{{DIcon}} Alright, guess there's no other choice.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 37.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Wonderful! I can't thank you enough. Huni was right about you &mdash; you have kindness in your hearts.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 1 trinidad 38.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Come with me to the other side of the mountain. I'll bring you up to speed on each step of the ceremony. As experienced warriors, I'm sure you'll pick it up in no time.
:{{Black Screen|Meanwhile, in a hidden cave...}}
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Achoo! Curses! Who dares insult the Great K'uhul Ajaw behind his back?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 01.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Oh, Great K'uhul Ajaw! Bless you!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Shut your filthy mouth, worm of the Abyss! Your putrid words defile the air we breathe! You make the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw sick to the stomach!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 02.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Speaking as a member of the [[Abyss Order]], that's music to my ears &mdash; exactly the kind of reaction we're going for. But on a personal level, I gotta say, it's pretty hurtful.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Never have we heard such brazen blustering from someone who is inches from death! Up yours, four-eyes! We spit in your face! *spitting sounds*
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 03.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Okay, well THAT I am at a loss to explain. How do I manage to stay so chirpy and cheerful? I can only guess it's some kind of powerful magic...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 04.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' But I digress. Mr. Kinich, I admit it &mdash; you, Sir, are a legendary hunter. Still, the only reason you caught me is that I was reluctant to run away.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 05.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' You see, I'm very interested in the lore of your tribe.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Kay.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 06.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' ...Is that it? "'Kay"? Aren't you intrigued to know what it is about you guys that prompted a visit from the Abyss?
:;(Sanka waits in silence for an answer from Kinich, in vain)
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 07.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' It's the extreme sports! The other day, I narrowly avoided getting hit by a very brave soul who'd just leaped off a cliff... I think you call it "bungee jumping"? Anyway, I was very impressed! That is what I call embracing the spirit of adventure!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 08.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Look, I even did a painting inspired by the bravery and freedom of the Scions of the Canopy...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' You scum-sucking swine! I swear, if you go bungee jumping, it'll be without a rope!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 ajaw 05.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Head-first of the tallest cliff, with a band of hunters on your tail! And nowhere left to run! And a bottomless cesspit waiting for you on the ground!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 09.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' You say that, but I get the sense that Mr. Kinich isn't planning to take my life right now. On top of that, I'm tired of spying on you from afar... So why don't we just negotiate a comfortable operating distance that works for both of us?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 10.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' I've heard that the most important thing in human relationships is to respect each other's boundaries. What do you say, Mr. Kinich?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' ...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Or... you could tell me what it is you're really after.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 fuchikami 11.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Wha...?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 3 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' And then I'll name my price.
----<!-- black screen transition -->
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Ugh, the Abyss contamination is back... No surprises there. No doubt that explains the Mountain King's recent activity.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 02.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' See those torches over there? Those are sacred flame offshoots that we requested from the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. They contain the power of the [[Pyro Archon]].
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you saying that the Sacred Flame and the [[Turnfire]] are the same thing?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 03.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Heh, for ceremonial purposes, at least. Sending someone to the [[Night Kingdom]] to retrieve the legendary Turnfire isn't exactly an option. More to the point though, the Sacred Flame is able to burn away Abyssal filth, so that's why we use it in the ceremony.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gotcha... So basically, we just need to clean up the filth with the Sacred Flame?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 04.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' That's one part of it, yes. But the complete ceremony is a bit more complicated than that.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 05.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' First, the flame bearer must collect a kindling of the Sacred Flame from the starting point, then use a grappling hook to fly up into the sky and light each of the Sacred Flame Pillars.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 06.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Then, they must go down into the canyon, all the way to the cave where the Mountain King slumbers, lighting braziers and the final altar along the way.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 07.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' The most skilled flame bearers can accomplish all of this without touching the ground once. As much as I hate to admit it, Kinich is capable of this.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, he can do all that flying without ever falling to the ground?
:{{DIcon}} So can you, Paimon.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, of course Paimon can! It'd be much harder for you guys.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 08.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Haha, well, don't worry &mdash; it's not a requirement of the ceremony. You're allowed to touch the ground. The only thing you're not allowed to do is turn back.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 09.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' The flame bearer must always keep moving forward. You can't skip a pillar, then come back to it after lighting the next one. To do so would be to disrespect our ancestors.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... What actually happens if you do turn back? Surely the fires don't just go out?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 10.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Umm... Well, if you're not careful, you might get burned.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about today, then? Does the same rule apply?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 11.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Oh no, don't worry. Today is just a practice, the order doesn't matter. You just need to take the sacred flame, cleanse the filth, then go light all the braziers.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 12.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Are you ready?
:{{DIcon}} Let's begin.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 4 trinidad 13.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' I'll repeat the key points again. Gather the kindling, cleanse the filth, and light all the braziers. I'll wait for you at the end.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Clear the Abyssal taint and light all the braziers.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Trinidad again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq002 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Ready when you are. Oh, and I'll repeat the key points again. Gather the kindling, cleanse the filth, and light all the braziers.

;(After obtaining the Sacred Flame)
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's use this kindling to complete our mission!

;(Approach the Abyssal filth)
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's Abyssal filth over there. Let's burn it away with the Sacred Flame.

;(After all braziers are lit)
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That should be all of the braziers. Let's regroup with Trinidad!

;(Talk to Trinidad)
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' I knew I was right about you. You have outperformed all of our previous candidates.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 02.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' If there's was a ancient name for outstanding flame bearers, I'm sure the Wayob would consider you for the honor.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon could probably get the job done, too.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Although, it would probably take Paimon quite a bit longer...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 03.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Haha. Alright, now there's still a few days left until the ceremony. I should probably get back so I can inform the [[Wayna|chief]] and the other elders that I have found the flame bearer we need.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... You mean, they've still got to sign off on it?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 04.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Some of them are still hoping we can come to an agreement with Kinich. But that's only because they haven't seen you in action.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 05.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Still, I'm the one responsible for securing a flame bearer, and my recommendation is you.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Just for Paimon's own peace of mind, are you sure it's not gonna be a problem having outlanders take on such an important role in your ceremony?
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 06.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' See that place over there? There was a time, long before the age of Burkina and the Mountain King, when we Scions of the Canopy called that our home.
:;(Camera view changes to show the [[Ancestral Temple]])
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 07.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' After a period of upheaval, our ancestors were forced to move away. Now, it has become a place where our youths go to develop courage and kindle a spirit of adventure.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 08.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' If we fail to keep the threat posed by the Mountain King at bay, it might not be long before we have to move again, and find a new home...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 09.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' So, to answer your question, I think everyone will agree that you are the right choice.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fair enough. Desperate times call for desperate measures...
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 10.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' I'll need you to drop by my place at some point before the ceremony, if that's alright. There are still a few final details that we need to discuss.
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, see you later then!
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 trinidad 11.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' You have my gratitude.
:;(Trinidad leaves)
:{{A|vo jnqlq002 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've helped out with a lot of other local festivals before, but this one feels a little different... Anyway, let's take a break before heading back to Trinidad's place.
