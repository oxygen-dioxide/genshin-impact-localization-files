|description = A vintage lyre borrowed from [[Amadhiah]] in [[Vimara Village]].<br />Mondstadt has a long-standing tradition of poetry and song. Bards from there tend to address their instruments as "Friend" or "Partner." Thus, one of them trusting Amadhiah with the instrument was nothing less than a gesture of intimacy and trust.

'''Vintage Lyre''' is a [[gadget]] that can be obtained during the [[World Quest]] ''[[The World of Aranara]]''. Throughout the [[Aranyaka]] Quest Series, more songs will be unlocked along with new functionality.

The lyre has a {{w|range (music)|range}} from C3 to B5. It has flats according to C {{w|Dorian_mode#Modern_Dorian_mode|Dorian}} for the bottom and middle rows (C3 to B4 with flats on E3, B3, E4, and B4) and C {{w|Phrygian_mode#Modern_Phrygian_mode|Phrygian}} for the top row (C5 to B5 with flats on D5, E5, A5, and B5). Notes are labeled with {{w|solfège}} syllables rather than note names, with C as ''do''. Multiple notes can be played simultaneously, but notes cannot be held, as expected of a plucked instrument.

==Usage==
Like other [[Music Gadgets]], the Vintage Lyre can be used to play music. In addition, playing particular songs unlocked by the Aranyaka quest series can activate multiple [[Exploration]] mechanics in [[Sumeru]].

==Disclaimer==
There is a disclaimer in-game regarding the use of the lyre:
:When using the Performance function, please make sure that you use an original composition or have the relevant rights to use the melody you are playing in order to avoid harming the rights of any third parties and to avoid any actions in breach of or incompatible with our Terms of Service. Otherwise, we may have to restrict your use of this function.<br />Additionally, the content you perform can be heard and used by other players using this in-game function. Please read and confirm that you acknowledge the aforementioned stipulations.

==Trivia==
* The solfège syllables are incorrectly labeled for the notes with flats, as {{w|Solfège#Minor|do-based minor}} uses chromatic solfège syllables for the notes that are different from those of the major scale. The correct syllables are:
** Top row: ''do '''ra''' '''me''' fa so '''le''' '''te'''''
** Middle row: ''do re '''me''' fa so la '''te'''''
** Bottom row: ''do re '''me''' fa so la '''te'''''
