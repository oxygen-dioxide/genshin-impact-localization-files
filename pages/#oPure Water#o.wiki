==Description==
{{Description|Said to be the legacy of a certain genius Potioneer, it can draw out the purest strength from within the body.<br><!--

-->The Fontaine Research Institute does not take the academic discipline of alchemy potions seriously. For that reason, even a genius Potioneer could not leave a mark on the storied history of the Institute. Only the stories passed back and forth among children provide a glimpse into his life. One of the tales shared most enthusiastically is that of how he was drowned in the pure water he created.<br><!--

-->And the life of the creator and the disappearance of their name seem to have made this glittering potion, which shines with a pure color, purer still.|Archive}}
