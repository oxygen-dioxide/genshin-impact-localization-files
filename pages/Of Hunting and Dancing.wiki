|description    = An encampment set up with some skill that has referenced the famed writings of the researcher [[Jacob Musk|Musk]] to recreate a [[hilichurl]] dwelling, and which can be used to study their living habits.<br>They say that in the past, the [[Knights of Favonius]] would set up such camps and engage in detailed planning, led by the Outriders, ahead of expeditions against monsters. The seafaring [[Crux Fleet]] also tends to set sand tables up in a similar fashion based on various sources of intelligence to simulate boarding an island and clearing it of monsters.
