Under the guidance of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], the God of Wisdom, Sumeru's culture primarily revolves around studying and research.

==Life in Sumeru==
As the nation that houses [[Sumeru Akademiya]], [[Teyvat]]'s largest known academic center, much of what is known about Sumeru is set in the context of the Akademiya.

People in Sumeru value rationality and wisdom, and the fact that many adults in Sumeru do not have dreams is in fact a source of pride for them. Knowledge is managed as a resource through a device known as the [[Akasha]] system, which is powered by the [[Gnosis]] of the previous [[Dendro]] [[Archon]], [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03: Prelude to Wisdom]</ref>

===Education===
{{main|Sumeru Akademiya}}
Education can take an extremely long time at Sumeru Akademiya. [[Lisa]], the most talented student to attend in two hundred years, managed to graduate in merely two years;<ref>{{Ref/CS|Lisa|Character Details}}</ref> most other students are not nearly so lucky.

The unnamed author of a certain message on the [[Cat's Tail Message Board#Chosen by the Sage|Cat's Tail Message Board]] was selected by a sage at the Akademiya and has gone to study there, but expresses regret that his parents will be old by the time he graduates. His message suggests he has recently come of age, putting him around 18 years old; assuming his parents are in their mid-40s to early 50s, this means his education will likely take somewhere around 15 to 20 years. This is corroborated by [[Hosseini]]'s dialogue, in which he claims he is "not even 30 yet" and that being an undergraduate at his age is not uncommon.

Lisa mentions feeling disillusioned with its workaholic culture, citing it as the reason for why she became so lazy after returning from Sumeru Akademiya.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Lisa|5}}</ref>

==Designs, Motifs, and Symbols==
===Character Cards===
The overall shape of Sumeru Character Cards is a large circle with a darker green crescent covering the upper part of the circle. To the left and right sides are a total of six circles, each with a different design:
*Bottom left is a horse with an hourglass
*Middle left appears to be a bird &mdash; possibly a {{w|simurgh}}, {{w|Huma bird|huma}}, or {{w|griffin}} &mdash; with a wheat stalk
*Top left is a lion with an {{w|Ionic order|Ionic column}}
*Top right is an elephant
*Middle right is a tree branching into a peacock
*Bottom right is a bull with a scroll

{{w|Arabesque}}-like patterns are also prominent in the background, alongside Moroccan trellis patterns (or {{w|quatrefoil}}s) which can be seen towards the bottom of the Cards. The trellis is more obvious on the Chinese Character Cards (see [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/25349199 Collei's official Chinese introduction]).

==Families and Lineages==
In Sumeru, people may derive their surnames from their ancestors. Descendants' surnames will prefix their ancestor's name with {{lang|Pur|fa=پور|fa_tl=son|zh=普尔}}; [[Anisa]]'s full name is Anisa Purbiruni, where {{lang|"Purbiruni"|zh=普尔比鲁尼}} is derived from the great sage Biruni who lived 500 years ago.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Sea-Beast}}</ref> Based on the previous example, {{lang|"[[Pursina]]"|zh=普尔希娜}} may be a surname used by descendants of a woman named Sina.<ref group="Note">The Persian name ''Sina'' is a male name and the Persian polymath {{w|Ibn Sina}} has his name rendered in Chinese as {{lang|mini=1|zh=伊本·西那|zh_rm=Yīběn Xīnà}}. However, the {{lang|''Sina''|zh=希娜|zh_rm=Xīnà}} in Pursina uses the female-exclusive character {{lang|mini=1|{{wt|娜||Etymology 2}}}}, indicating that Sina was a woman.</ref>

==Politics==
According to the trailer, the Akademiya governs Sumeru and handles much of the daily affairs of Sumeru. Knowledge is managed as a resource through the "Akasha System" which has something to do with the gnoses. This was left by the previous Dendro Archon.

A mercenary force that comes from an ancient civilization known as the [[The Eremites]]. They aren't part of any nation's forces and seem to be independent from Sumeru despite living in Sumeru.
