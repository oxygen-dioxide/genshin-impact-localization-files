|description    = A dinner plate with complex patterns on it. Such utensils have their usage originating in [[Liyue]], though the glazing process has been modified to match local methods, making it most hardy and durable indeed. The images do look quite complicated, but it in fact requires a lot less work than might first appear on account of the special drawing tools available.<br>The plate's main colors, being green and dark orange, prevent it from being stained with grease or oil too easily, and people thus use it to hold meat dishes.
