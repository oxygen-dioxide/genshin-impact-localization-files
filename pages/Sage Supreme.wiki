{{Quest Description|The fateful day of the Epic Feast Showdown has arrived, and you hunger for the taste of challenge.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Read the [[#Gallery|"Epic Feast Showdown" Promotional Board]], optional)<!-- Temporarily replaces [[Collective of Plenty General Message Board]] content -->
:'''"Epic Feast Showdown" Promotional Board:''' "A banquet becomes a battlefield! Appetites square off in the 'Epic Feast Showdown'! Now in full swing!"
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Next to this passionate slogan is a portrait of Varesa, who seems to be the spokesperson for this event. There's even a list of her victories...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...It seems that she emerges as champion whenever she enters the competition. Is that why so many challengers come here to ask around?)

;(Talk to Iansan)
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oh, hey! You're here!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' It's been a while! When Varesa told me you signed up for the Epic Feast Showdown, I could barely believe it!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 02.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Sounds like Varesa might finally be in for a challenge this year!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Ahh... Honestly... I'm not even that good...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's wrong? Sounds like you're still half-asleep...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Just hungry... It's competition day, so... Gotta show up with an empty stomach...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 03.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Not much longer, Varesa. [[Atolli]]'s firing up the ovens as we speak.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Got it... I can... wait...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 04.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Oh, about the competition... Usually, you have to pay for the food if you don't finish.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 05.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' But, when I heard you two were coming, I talked to Atolli, and we agreed to waive your expenses!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really!? So, we get to eat for free?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Awesome! Now, we can just take it easy and box-up whatever we don't finish!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, we appreciate the generosity.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 06.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Please, it's our pleasure! You've done so much for [[Natlan]]. Just think of it as a small token of gratitude.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 07.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' When the [[Abyss]] invaded, we weren't hit with large waves of monsters, but [[Great Volcano of Tollan|the volcano]] became unusually active.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 08.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' As the Guardians of Tollan, we couldn't stand by and do nothing, so we immediately dispatched a team to the summit.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 09.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Varesa was a key member of that team.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 10.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Varesa?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hm? Oh, right! Yes, I was there! I brought so many [[Saurus Crackers]] with me that day... Ah, sorry. Not the point...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' There were [[Abyss Tumor]]s all around the summit, agitating the magma and spawning all kinds of monsters.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' But, once [[Mavuika|the Pyro Archon]] did her thing, we were able to smash them to smithereens.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Looking back on it, the goal was probably to hold us up so we couldn't send reinforcements to the areas around the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame|Stadium]].
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good point... Your tribe must full of great warriors, with all the training you do... The Abyss really is a cunning enemy.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and you mentioned something about the "Guardians of Tollan." What does that mean?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 11.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Hahaha, that is a duty our people have held for generations.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 12.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' The volcano is very important to us. It brings disaster... but also opportunity.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 13.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Our people rose to the challenge of living in this environment, and in return, we get fertile soil and a thriving ecosystem.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That's right! The Natlanese are never ones to shy away from a challenge.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Although, whenever we spot unusual volcanic activity, we always report it to the Stadium.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so there's a lot more to this place than good food, huh...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, where did Varesa go? Wasn't she just here?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oh, y'know, I just saw her leave. I thought someone must have called for her.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 acatl 14.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Ha, my guess is that she followed the scent of the food straight to the kitchen.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go check on her! Paimon understands the torture of an empty stomach better than anyone...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 1 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I'll lead the way.

;(Approach Varesa)
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That smell... So delicious...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Juicy mushrooms, melted cheese, mouthwatering steak... *salivating*...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 atolli 01.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Ah, look who it is.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 atolli 02.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' I thought I felt an... intense energy around here. I know better than to get between you and your next meal, haha.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 atolli 03.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' The food just needs a few more minutes. Here, this should tide you over in the meantime.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Wait, is this... [[Braised Meat|braised meat]] stew? Thank you, Uncle Atolli!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' *gulp*... Ahhhhhh...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Varesa! You really did head straight for the kitchen... Um, what's up? You seemed lost in your own world just now.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, it's you... Sorry! I completely spaced out just now.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' The next thing I knew, I was all the way over here with a bowl of stew in my hands.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Hahaha, don't worry about it. I think we can all guess what happened.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 atolli 04.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Prep took longer than usual, so I had to push back the competition. Sorry for making you wait, Varesa, especially on an empty stomach.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' No worries, Uncle Atolli! Your delicious soup fixed me right up!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, that sounds more like the Varesa we know.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I become completely useless when I'm hungry. I really wanted to focus on the conversation back there, but... no luck.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That's perfectly normal. It takes a lot of energy to train the way you do, so you need more food to make up for it.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You two know what I mean, right? Try to do too much on an empty stomach, and you end up feeling weak and lightheaded.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, boy. Paimon's been there before.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' So, when is the competition supposed to start? Not sure I can wait much longer...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 atolli 05.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' One sec &mdash; I'll go check.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 atolli 06.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' We're all set! Time to gather the contestants, [[Acatl]]. The Showdown is about to begin!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 acatl 02.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Got it!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 acatl 03.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Let's head to the venue. The food will be brought out shortly.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 2 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Finally! I'm so ready to dig in!

;(Start the competition)<!--{{DIcon}} Start Competition-->
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, it smells SO good! Varesa had the right idea &mdash; it's definitely worth the wait!
:{{DIcon}} Yep, it looks great.
:{{DIcon}} These portions, though...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... We could MAYBE finish one portion between the two of us, and even that's a stretch. But, one portion each? There's no chance...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Time to dig in! Thanks for the food, Uncle Atolli!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, hold on! Varesa's plate looks completely different than ours!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Hahaha, I forgot to mention, the competition actually has two levels &mdash; the "regular challenge" and the "Varesa challenge."
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 02.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' The Varesa challenge is only for people who have completed the regular challenge in the past.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 03.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' It's named after Varesa because... well, so far, she's the only one who's been able to finish it.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're kidding... You had to invent a whole new challenge just for her?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 04.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Believe me, if Varesa competed in the same class as everyone else, the winner would be decided before the competition even started. What's the fun in that?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 05.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Only one other person has come close to beating the Varesa challenge, and that would be the Pyro Archon herself.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, you're saying Mavuika has done this before?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 06.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Of course. She breezed through the normal level, but the Varesa challenge was still too much, even for her.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 07.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Back then, it was all part of an investigation. You see, the Pyro Archon covers all expenses at the [[Weary Inn]] the night before the [[Pilgrimage]]. And, each time, Varesa's tab would show several dozen people's worth of food for a single person.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 08.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' The [[Speaker's Chamber]] thought someone had to be wrong. Maybe there was a mistake in the accounts, or someone was trying to defraud the Archon...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 09.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' But, once the Archon finally saw Varesa's appetite in action, that was that.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... Okay, so...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're saying... Mavuika had these portions, and she just... "breezed through"?
:{{DIcon}} Let's just go for it.
:{{DIcon}} It'll only get harder as the food gets cold.

:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're right! Let's go! Paimon's gonna defend her honor with everything she's got!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Tender, juicy, grilled to perfection... It's delicious!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' *eating ravenously*
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You gotta try this one, too, {{Traveler}}! It's amazing! Ooh, and this!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' *eating ravenously*
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And this one is... *burp*...

:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Paimon's ready to throw in the towel...
:{{DIcon}} What happened to defending your honor?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay &mdash; Paimon's tried as hard as she could, but this enemy is too strong...
<!--image goes away-->
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know what? There really should be a "Paimon challenge"! Paimon's smaller than the rest of you. It's no fair for her portion to be the same!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Ahhhhhh...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 01.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Let's hear it for Varesa, who has once again completed the challenge!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 02.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' And, with a ten percent increase in portion size, it's a new personal best!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 acatl 10.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Well done, Varesa!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Amazing job!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, it's nothing! Uncle Atolli's food is just too good. I couldn't stop myself.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You actually finished it... Geez, are you okay?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hm? Why wouldn't I be?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You don't feel bloated? Or like you're gonna throw up? Paimon's so full, it feels like she's gonna sink...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, nope. I feel good, actually. Satisfied, y'know?
:{{DIcon}} Spoken like a true champion...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Thanks! This is my specialty, after all &mdash; not that it's good for anything outside these competitions.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' If I'm honest, I'd rather be like you or Coach Iansan &mdash; a hero brave enough to stand against the Abyss!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Don't worry, Varesa. For someone as talented as you, it's only a matter of time before you shine in the arena.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Iansan! Did you beat the challenge, too?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Of course! The regular challenge is easy for me. I've attempted the Varesa challenge a few times, too... But, never even came close.
:{{DIcon}} That's still pretty amazing...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, there has to be more to this than just appetite. Is there some kind of trick?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the end, it was like the meat turned into one big, greasy blob, and it was so hard to keep going...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, that's when you balance it out with some mushrooms! The ones from my orchard.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That's what I did, anyway. As soon as the food came out, I set a few mushrooms to the side, so they wouldn't soak up too much oil.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 12.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Or get too mushy. That way, you have something fresh and fruity to balance it out.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, so that's the secret! Use the mushrooms to cut through the heaviness!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 13.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That's right! You tried them yourselves, remember? If it tastes like a fruit, might as well use it like one.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 14.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I think more people from outside the tribe would beat the challenge if they knew about the mushroom.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 03.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Iansan, some of the contestants are looking for you. Something about being ready to train?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' They want to exercise? After all that food!? ...Sorry, everyone. I should intervene.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, go tell them to take it easy!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 20.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Well, how did everyone do, Uncle Atolli?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 04.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Almost half finished the regular challenge. I believe that's a record!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 12.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Either the contestants are {{sic|getter}} more experienced, or my cooking was extra good this time.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, everything was delicious! Especially when it first came out, all hot and steaming!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 05.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Thank you! When cooked at high heat, that mushroom has a special fragrance that really brings out the flavor of the other ingredients.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 06.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Oh, and since you're new here, I should mention something else about that mushroom.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 07.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' It's an excellent addition to any dish, but there are actually two varieties &mdash; red, which is the most common, and green.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 08.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' There's not much to note about the red ones &mdash; sell them, eat them, do whatever you want. But, if you see a green one, it must be picked and eaten right away.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why's that?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 15.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That's just what a scholar from [[Sumeru]] said when the orchard first opened.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 16.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' No one knows the reason. We just do as we're told.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 17.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Whenever a green mushroom pops up in the orchard, I pick it and eat it. The flavor is identical to the red ones.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, because that's not weirdly specific at all...
:{{DIcon}} Don't you want to know the reason behind it?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 09.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Well... of course! Who wouldn't be intrigued by something like that? But curiosity isn't always a good thing, right?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 10.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Oh, by the way, Varesa, I'm almost out of [[Red Berryshroom|red mushrooms]]. Could you run to the orchard and grab some more for me?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 18.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Of course, Uncle Atolli! I'm on it!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 varesa 19.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Wanna come with, you two?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Paimon wouldn't mind working off some of that food...
:{{DIcon}} (I'm intrigued about that mushroom.)
:{{DIcon}} (I should see what Varesa thinks.)
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon will take that as a yes! Alright, let's go! Thanks for the food, Atolli!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 3 atolli 11.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Haha, my pleasure! But, try to finish it all next time!
----
;(Approach the stove at Varesa's orchard)
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Phew, after that meal, I'm ready to tackle anything!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, something on your mind? Is it what Uncle Atolli said about the green mushrooms? Don't worry, he can be a bit... dramatic sometimes.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' The green mushrooms don't appear that often. Besides, I check the orchard every day, and if I see one, I eat it.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' If anything, I wish there were more around here &mdash; means more free mushrooms for me!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... is that one right there? Huh, talk about a coincidence...
:{{DIcon}} So, it really it green...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' See? There's nothing special about it except the color.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Gimme one sec. I'll start a fire and grill it right up!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna pass on this one... She's way too stuffed from earlier...
:{{DIcon}} I wonder why that scholar said what he said...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You mean, why we have to pick and eat the green mushrooms right away?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Mmm... To be honest, I'm curious, too. The scholar looked really serious when he said it, but he never explained the reason behind it.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Uncle Atolli has a point, though. Curiosity can be a bad thing. If we stop doing what that scholar said, something terrible could happen...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You could look into it at least... That's what an adventurer would do.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, but... my tribe is more important. I love everything about this place. Maintaining the status quo is good enough for me.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I know the truth is important, too. But, I don't have the right to make a decision that could put the people around me in danger.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 12.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' In other words... *sigh* Deep down, I guess I'm just scared &mdash; scared that "change" could mean losing control...
:{{DIcon}} If you're strong enough to uncover the truth...
:{{DIcon}} You're strong enough to command the truth.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 13.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' C&mdash;Command the truth?
:{{DIcon}} If fear is the only thing stopping you...
:{{DIcon}} Let us help you shoulder the burden.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We don't have to stop following the scholar's orders. We can start by gathering information.
:{{DIcon}} You're right &mdash; curiosity can be a bad thing...
:{{DIcon}} But, what you don't know can still hurt you.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 14.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hm... You have a point!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 15.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, y'know, you remind me of another hero from our tribe. Her name was [[Fietena]].
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 16.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Just like you, she was full of courage, and never stopped challenging and exploring the unknown... She's my idol!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 17.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Actually, could you give me a moment? All I need is three seconds... Lady Fietena, lend my your courage.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 18.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Three, two, one...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 19.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You're right! I can't keep running from the truth. I... want to command it, just like you said.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 20.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' So, where should we start with the investigation? You probably have a bunch of experience.
:{{DIcon}} I think I should taste it first.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 21.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, the green mushroom, you mean? The taste is the same as the red ones. There's nothing special there...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, {{Traveler}} is a lot more... perceptive than most people. {{MC|m=He|f=She}} should at least give it a try.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 22.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, I see... Then, I'll grill some up right away!
:{{Black Screen|Varesa cooks the mushrooms, and everyone digs in. Just like Varesa said, the taste is the same.}}
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, notice anything, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Nope. No difference in taste.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just like Varesa said... Guess it was the same for all of us.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Finally, a worthy devotee after all this time... Fascinating.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who... who said that!?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 02.ogg}} '''???:''' No need for alarm. There is only one among you who piqued my interest, and that is the one with the golden hair. Seeing as you all appear to be acquainted, I allowed the rest of you to hear my voice as well.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Now, I shall grant you all the honor of becoming my first subjects in this era.
:{{DIcon}} Cut to the chase.
:{{DIcon}} You talk a big talk, but I've heard that before.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 04.ogg}} '''???:''' Now, now... YOU were the ones who wanted to learn more about my origins. I merely granted your wish.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 23.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Origins... Wait, YOU'RE the green mushroom!?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah, so you do know how to use your brain, young one. You'll excuse me if I have no interest in you &mdash; craven and dull-witted as you usually seem.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, watch it, buddy!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Heh, let me remind you, it was your own curiosity that started all of this. I see no reason for me to stand down.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 07.ogg}} '''???:''' I only granted you this audience because I saw potential in you.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 08.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' I am the [[Sage-Lord of Fungi]]. Serving me is a great honor, as well as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hah, Sage-Lord? Good one... Did you come up with that yourself?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 09.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' You mock my name? Hmph, all you do is make a mockery of your own taste!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 10.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Ahem... Of course, the Sage-Lord of Fungi is too dignified for petty arguments with lesser organisms.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 24.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Sure doesn't sound like it...
:{{DIcon}} Nope.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 11.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' That's enough out of you! What's wrong with you humans? You should be full of reverence at this point...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 12.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Uh, in that case! I don't know what went wrong, but you lack the trust and worship to be my subjects, so we shall have to table that for the time being.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 13.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' However, I am willing to share my sagely knowledge with you. I have all the answers you seek.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 14.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' As with all seekers of said knowledge, all you have to do is prove your sincerity, and we shall see if you're worthy.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, more green mushrooms! Right in front of us!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 15.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' These clones are my most loyal subjects as well as the keepers of my secrets.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 16.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' If you want answers, then gather your wits and search for clues. I shall await your summons.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 17.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' It might be advisable to brush up on your devotion in the meantime...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 18.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Hehehehe...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The voice is gone... Finally! Paimon has enough of that racket!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Talking in our heads without permission, spewing a bunch of nonsense... Even [[Ajaw]] is better than him!
:{{DIcon}} Definitely.
:{{DIcon}} I still think Ajaw is worse.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 25.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' So, do you think what he said was true? About being the Sage-Lord of Fungi and all that...?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe, but most of it sounded like hot air to Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} We may not know who he is, but we know he exists.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 26.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' True, that conversation in our heads definitely was real...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And it proves these mushrooms aren't regular mushrooms at all. Something fishy is going on!
:{{DIcon}} Which means we made the right call to investigate.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 27.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I guess this is the beginning of our hero's journey, then. So, let's make like heroes and get to the bottom of this... so we can command the truth and this mushroom!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 28.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Uh, okay, that sounded a lot cooler in my head...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we have one thing going for us &mdash; we've faced mushrooms before, and they're pretty pathetic as far as enemies go.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 bifrons 19.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Ugh, such insolence!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 29.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Did you hear that? Sounds like someone's mad.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're spying on us!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 varesa 30.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' ...No response. Guess he's not gonna admit it.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 4 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, he said his "subjects" hold the clues to his secrets... Who knows if he was telling the truth, but we can't just ignore the green mushrooms. So, let's start investigating!
:;(Paimon flies over to a red mushroom, which transforms in a puff of green smoke)
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so this one is red... Wahhhhhh!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Fungus]]! It turned into a Fungus! In Natlan of all places!?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' So... this is one of his "subjects"? Hehe, it's kinda cute.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 mushwatalli 01.ogg}} '''Mushwatalli:''' Bull warrior compliment? Much appreciate!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 mushwatalli 02.ogg}} '''Mushwatalli:''' No! Bull warrior natural enemy. Eat. Must resist!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Careful, Varesa. This is a kind of monster from Sumeru. Even though it looks cute, it can still attack you!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' A monster? That's too bad. I was hoping we could be friends.
:{{DIcon}} "Gather your wits and search for clues"...
:{{DIcon}} Well, surely violence is a form of wit.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 mushwatalli 03.ogg}} '''Mushwatalli:''' ...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 mushwatalli 04.ogg}} '''Mushwatalli:''' Mercy! Mercy!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 mushwatalli 05.ogg}} '''Mushwatalli:''' Food, is sacred! Everything else, waste!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 mushwatalli 06.ogg}} '''Mushwatalli:''' That, all I know. Promise!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It turned back... into a normal mushroom... Um, what's going on?
:{{DIcon}} I guess it told us everything it knows.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You mean, that food is sacred?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that's a whole bunch of nothing. Let's go look somewhere else.

;(Approach the green mushroom)
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, a green mushroom... And, it turned into a Fungus. Nice try, but you're not scaring Paimon with that one twice!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, let's go on the initiative! Hey, you &mdash; what's the whole "food is sacred" thing about?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 01.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' As our Sage-Lord stated, you must demonstrate your wits to receive the answers you seek. That means I should be the one asking the questions, not you.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so it turns out this one can talk... Fine. What do we have to do? Solve a riddle or something?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' A riddle? I'm not good at that... Could you, um, give us an easy one?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 02.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' That sounds like a problem for your friends. Besides, did I say this was up for negotiation?
:{{DIcon}} I'm not a fan of riddles, either.
:{{DIcon}} I'm pretty much a riddle master.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 03.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' Enough chatter. Time for my question.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 04.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' Why are all the mushrooms in this orchard willing to become the subjects of the Sage-Lord?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, man... How are we supposed to know?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Because... you're his clones, right? I remember him saying something like that.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 05.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' Alas, no wits in sight. The answer could never be that simple!
:{{DIcon}} Because... he's a "fun guy"?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 06.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' What!? How did you get that so fast?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh... It's that kind of riddle...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sumeru mushrooms... Of course. Paimon can't believe she didn't think of this possibility.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Wait, does that mean everyone in Sumeru is into puns? Huh, is it because the people are so clever?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no, we just, uh... have a lot of experience with [[Cyno|these kinds of jokes]].
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 07.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' Well, since you have proven your wits, I will now answer your question.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 08.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' The act of eating is not only a physical necessity, but also a sacred ritual.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 asmu 09.ogg}} '''Asmu:''' Mushrooms like us are the Sage-Lord's intermediaries. Incinerating our flesh forges a spiritual connection between you and the Sage-Lord himself.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, so that's why he could speak to us in our heads.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you're saying, if we want to talk to him again, all we have to do is... eat more mushrooms?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, wait! Don't turn back into a regular mushroom! Too late... And all we have is another cryptic message.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Well, if eating is a sacred ritual, maybe we need to perform some kind of ceremony with special tools of something...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good thinking, Varesa! Let's try and ask the other mushrooms.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, but we should probably pick this one first, since it's a green mushroom.
;(Obtain {{Item|Green Berryshroom}})

;(Approach the two Fungi)
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, there're two Fungi over there! Looks like they're discussing something.
:;(The group listens on from behind a bush)
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 huzziya 01.ogg}} '''Huzziya:''' Have you figured out how you're going to test the humans?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 01a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 01b.ogg}}--> '''Ammuna:''' Of course! Any random question should do the trick. They don't look very smart to me.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 huzziya 02.ogg}} '''Huzziya:''' Wow, cool! You green-caps are so wise, just like our Sage-Lord. I'm so jealous...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 02b.ogg}}--> '''Ammuna:''' Hmph, it's all progressing as expected. I know exactly what they're going to ask:
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 03.ogg}} '''Ammuna:''' "Oh, please, PLEASE tell us how to conduct the ceremony!"
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 04.ogg}} '''Ammuna:''' And I shall respond, "Hmph, nothing in life comes for free. You have two choices &mdash; answer a question about the stars and moon above, or the dark abyss below."
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 huzziya 03.ogg}} '''Huzziya:''' Ooh! And they'll say, "Noo, I'm stumped. I can't think anymore or my cap will explode into spores!"
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 05a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 05b.ogg}}--> '''Ammuna:''' They're humans, idiot. They don't have caps or spores.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 huzziya 04.ogg}} '''Huzziya:''' Oh, right... duh...
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 06.ogg}} '''Ammuna:''' And then I'll say, "Hah, you can't even answer the most basic of basic questions? Come back after you've studied for a few more decades!"
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 huzziya 05.ogg}} '''Huzziya:''' Hah, yeah! A few more decades!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 07.ogg}} '''Ammuna:''' Of course, they're so dense, it might actually take them that long to realize that, if eating is a ritual, then obviously... the ceremony is the cooking.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 huzziya 06.ogg}} '''Huzziya:''' I mean, obviously it's the cooking! Hahaha!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Uh, did they just give us the answer?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 ammuna 08.ogg}} '''Ammuna:''' Ah! Who goes there!?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And you think we're the dense one? Look in the mirror, buddy!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 huzziya 07.ogg}} '''Huzziya:''' Eek, a floating pale organism! Out of nowhere! My cap almost burst into spores!
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, wait &mdash; don't disappear! At least explain yourselves first!
:{{DIcon}} Back to regular mushrooms, huh.
:{{DIcon}} Well, we already got what we needed.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, we passed the test? Where's the sense of accomplishment?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So much for "gathering our wits"... We didn't have to use our brains at all.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, well... The important thing is, the Sage-Lord of Fungi wants us to use cooking to establish a stronger mental connection with him.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That sounds right... Uncle Atolli did say, when you cook this mushroom, the higher the heat, the better the fragrance.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! That was the case when you grilled them in the orchard, too! Heat really does release their flavor!
:{{DIcon}} If we cook them just right...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we'll be able to see the Sage-Lord's true form.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, let's give it a try!
:{{DIcon}} Sound like a plan, Varesa?
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Definitely... But, we should probably explain the situation to Uncle Acatl and the rest of the tribe first.
:{{A|vo vrslq003 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good call! It's best for everyone to be prepared!
