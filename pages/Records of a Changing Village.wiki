The '''Records of a Changing Village''' is a quest item obtained during the [[Archon Quests|Archon Quest]] "[[Bygones Times Like Dust Passing]]."

==Text==
A branch family of exorcists used to live in the east of the village, but in around two weeks, the mother died of disease, the [[Shenhe|young daughter]] went missing, and shortly after, the father hanged himself on a tree in the yard of his own house.

It has been confirmed that traces of an evil god's remains were found in the village.

The villagers are panicking as no one is certain whether the evil god's remains are gone for good.

Do be careful when you are in this area.
