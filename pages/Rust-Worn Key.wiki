'''Rust-Worn Key''' is a quest item that is used in various locations.

==Konda Village==
It is located behind a [[Thunder Barrier]] near the torii shrine in the [[Konda Village]] well visited in the quest [[A Strange Story in Konda]] (see the page for details). Passing through the barrier and climbing up a vine will lead to a room.

Picking up the key in the room will initiate the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon:''' Eh, another key? Oh well. You know the saying&mdash; "Where there's a key, there's a lock."
:'''Paimon:''' And the thing that needs locking up most is treasure! So let's take that key with us, (Traveler)<!--username-->!
{{Dialogue end}}

It can be used at the barrier site at the end of [[Sacrificial Offering]].

=="Seiraimaru"==
It is located in a Common Chest protected by a [[Thunder Barrier]], in the ship [["Seiraimaru"]]. A seelie will lead you past it.

It is used to unlock a door in the main hull.

==Notes==
*The keys are not interchangeable.
