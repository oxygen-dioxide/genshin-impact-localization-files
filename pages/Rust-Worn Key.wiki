'''Rust-Worn Key''' is a [[Quest Item]] that is used in various locations.

==Konda Village==
It is located behind a [[Thunder Barrier]] near the torii shrine in the [[Konda Village]] well visited in the {{Quest|A Strange Story in Konda}} (see the page for details). Passing through the barrier and climbing up a vine will lead to a room.

Picking up the key in the room will initiate the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Paimon:''' Eh, another key? Oh well. You know the saying&mdash; "Where there's a key, there's a lock."
:'''Paimon:''' And the thing that needs locking up most is treasure! So let's take that key with us, {{Traveler}}<!--username-->!
{{Dialogue End}}

It can be used at the barrier site at the end of the {{Quest|Sacrificial Offering}}.

=="Seiraimaru"==
It is located in a Common Chest protected by a [[Thunder Barrier]], in the ship {{LL|"Seiraimaru"|.}} A [[seelie]] will lead the player to reach it.

It is used to unlock a door in the main hull.

==Chenyu Vale==
Used to open a gate to get a Spirit Carp, this key can be found right next to the gate near a pound.

==Notes==
*The keys are not interchangeable.
