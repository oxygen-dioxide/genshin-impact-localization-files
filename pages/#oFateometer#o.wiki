'''"Fateometer"''' is a [[Gadget]] obtained during {{Quest|A Decision (Hangout Event)}}.

This device can be placed on a valid surface and interacted with to draw cards with random numbers from 01 to 20. If the player draws a number between 02 and 19, the color of the card will be purple, number 01 will be blue with swirling effects and number 20 will be orange.

==Trivia==
* The "Fateometer" was created by [[Freminet]].<ref name="AD">{{Ref/Quest|A Decision (Hangout Event)}}</ref>
* The gadget functions essentially the same as an Icosahedron or twenty-sided die (D20) commonly used for tabletop RPGs. In such games (e.g. ''Dungeons and Dragons'') generally a roll of 1 is considered a "Critical Failure" (will always miss/fail), while a 20 is a "Critical Success" (will always hit/succeed), thus the special gloomy or cheery effects on the gadget for those rolls.
** Fittingly, the Fateometer also appears in {{Quest|Silent Night}}, which involves tabletop RPG gameplay.
