{{Quote|Natlan's Archon and leader, the everlasting flame of hope for all living beings, and the cleansing flame that incinerates all evil.|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/Natlan?char=7 Mavuika]</ref>}}
==Personality==
{{Quote|The leader of Natlan who inherited the Ancient Name of "Kiongozi." She made a vow to illuminate the future of the nation of war with the Sacred Flame.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
As the current [[Pyro Archon|God of War]], Mavuika embodies a profound sense of duty and responsibility towards her nation, [[Natlan]]. This unwavering devotion earned her a place in the hearts of the Natlanese, where she is revered and respected for her leadership and commitment to their well-being. Mavuika's background with the [[Scions of the Canopy]] has instilled in her a passion for competition and radical sports, reflecting her adventurous spirit. However, in a conversation with [[Capitano]], she acknowledged that she no longer possesses the youthful vigor she once had, with no longer being in her prime like she had used to be.

Intelligent and calculating, Mavuika came up with a plan to eradicate the Abyss invasions threatening Natlan, driven by her desire to secure a peaceful future for her people. This ambitious plan came at a great personal cost; 500 years ago, she sacrificed her life in the [[Sacred Flame]] to be reborn in the present day with the sole purpose of realizing her vision. Mavuika is known for her willingness to relinquish anything dear to her, including cherished possessions accumulated over the years, in her relentless pursuit to safeguard Natlan from any peril.

Mavuika's bravery is unmatched, evidenced by her decision to confront Capitano in combat to reclaim her [[Gnosis]]. She ventured into the [[Night Kingdom]] alongside the Traveler, displaying extraordinary resolve, and was prepared to face Capitano a second time to thwart his insidious plans to manipulate Natlan's Ley Lines with Ororon, a move that could have dire consequences for her homeland.

In critical moments, Mavuika often retreats into her memories, seeking clarity and reassurance to guide her actions. This contemplative practice was evident during critical events, such as the rescue of Kachina by the Traveler, Paimon, Iansan, Mualani, and Chasca; during the intense Abyss invasion in Natlan; and in the final confrontation against the [[Abyss]] in the Night Kingdom.

Beyond her role as an Archon, Mavuika is friendly and approachable, cultivating warm connections with those around her. Her welcoming nature was particularly evident when she met the [[Traveler]], expressing genuine surprise upon learning that their experiences in other nations had not been as harmonious as those in Natlan.

<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Mavuika is a tall woman with light skin and red eyes with yellow sun-shaped forms around her reddish-yellow pupils. She has red, knee-long, wavy hair with yellow undersides which resemble flames. It parts symmetrically. 

When Mavuika channels her power of the divine throne, her hair glows a fiery yellow.

Prior to her ascension as the Pyro Archon during her time in [[Huitztlan]], Mavuika wore a white dress with a red and orange accent alongside with a scarf. Her sun-shaped forms that are in her eyes were not present at the time.

{{Quote|Mavuika? Ohh! You mean the one who competed with me in the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]! Hahaha, you'd think an [[Archon]] could hold their liquor better than that! Uh... what? They said I got wasted first? No freaking way, not a chance! That day, I was... uh, hang on a sec, now why did I go see the Pyro Archon that day again...?|[[Varka]]'s response to [[Alice]]'s question about the results of the "meeting" in Natlan, as he scratched his head in thought}}
Now, how to introduce her? The bearer of "Kiongozi," Mavuika, a leader completely worthy of leading the people of Natlan.

The woven scrolls and epics record all the most legendary of ancient deeds. Great heroes emerge, one after the other, and glory is passed down from generation to generation, and she has never failed to live up to such heavy expectations.

She who shoulders the title of the "strongest," she who respects all beings, be they strong or weak, and treats all equally.

For this, the people love her, sing her praises, and follow her willingly, with all their hearts.

Each time, when she addresses the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], her hair flutters with the [[Sacred Flame]] as her majestic voice rings in our ears.

She casts her inspiring gaze upon [[Natlan/Culture#Tribes of Natlan|every warrior]], every [[Saurian]]. She calls upon every flame of Natlan, uniting all fires into a bright light to drive away the darkness.

As we support each other, stumbling through the valley of the long, boundless night, wiping the tears from the corners of our eyes, and finally struggle to lift up our heavy heads—

We see naught but that unwavering, unchanging red, like the sun rising in the east.

What did she sacrifice? What did she give up? What kind of will has led her to this day?

We have no doubt that she will lead Natlan to yet another victory.

Our Sun will never set.

|text1         = <p>When the name "Mavuika" is mentioned, the citizens of [[Natlan]] will not be stingy with their praise, for she has proven herself well-qualified and worthy of respect, be it as a leader or [[Archon]].</p><!--
              --><p>She is the pinnacle of strength in Natlan, and she has the bearing to match. Even newly-arrived travelers need only hear her speak at the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] to know that she merits being known as the sun.</p><!--
              --><p>She is exceedingly awe-inspiring, but is no unsmiling ruler whose ways may as well be set in stone. In informal situations, she is an enthusiastic and friendly big-sister figure, always ready to chat, and ever open to reasonable suggestions.</p><!--
              --><p>On the eve of the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], the [[Weary Inn]] is often packed with passionate revelers, and Mavuika can often be found there, playing cards or singing songs with everyone, and even if some drunk person splashes their drink onto her, she doesn't mind at all.</p><!--
              --><p>After all, for someone who can ignite their hair to dry off said drink, such incidents are small beans. When such levity is hard to come by, why let something so minor spoil the mood?</p><!--
              --><p>But should the person intend to start a drinking contest, it is Mavuika's desire to win that will be kindled. As the "battle" has begun, there can be no room for retreat or surrender. The victor will be determined, one way or the other.</p><!--
              --><p>Since becoming Archon, her habits have remained utterly unchanged, and this has allowed her to make many friends across the tribes.</p><!--
              --><p>However, not everyone possesses the subtle sense of proper propriety for such a relationship. Indeed, she can be too down-to-earth, and with her lack of airs, some misjudge the situation and get the false impression that they can use their friendship with an Archon to their own benefit.</p><!--
              --><p>Strangely enough, though people of this sort are a dime a dozen, they have never caused any major trouble, for Mavuika has never responded to such ridiculous requests &mdash; a solemn, icy stare is all she needs to send the other party scampering away.</p><!--
              --><p>The sight of those ever-burning eyes casting such a frigid gaze wakes those confused fools up in an instant to the fact that Mavuika is still the leader of a nation, a supreme deity.</p><!--
              --><p>A [[Speaker's Chamber]] staff member once suggested that she should subject those who so harass her to at least token punishment, lest there be an endless stream of incidents to come, but she refused.</p><!--

|text2         = <p>Theoretically, anyone in Natlan can become the [[Pyro Archon]], so long as they prove that they are the mightiest warrior of their era during a Pilgrimage.</p><!--
              --><p>Therefore, the rulers of the nation have varied wildly in personality and style. Some worshipped power and strength, valuing results. To them, any price was acceptable so long as the ends could be achieved.</p><!--
              --><p>Mavuika is just the opposite. In the eyes of others, she is undoubtedly your typical "perfectionist" &mdash; not only must things be done well, but also beautifully.</p><!--
              --><p>To pursue quality and completeness is only human, but doing so often requires extra time. And whenever anyone tells her that such an approach isn't efficient enough, Mavuika has a set of arguments at the ready.</p><!--
              --><p>First, there are no standalone events in this world. Tracing events backward reveals causes, while moving forward reveals outcomes. Humans are incapable of analyzing the whole chain of events. All they can do is handle each one as best they can, and avoid leaving hidden pitfalls.</p><!--
              --><p>Second, all past events become valuable experiences. Successes serve as references, and failures as lessons. But if matters were dealt with carelessly, all they will leave are warnings to not repeat the same mistakes.</p><!--
              --><p>But apart from these two ideas, Mavuika also has a very important reason for her approach that she rarely ever mentions &mdash; and that is "fun."</p><!--
              --><p>She has a broad range of hobbies, and has unparalleled skill in the various sports and games popular across the tribes, but one sentence can sum up all of these interests &mdash; she loves getting better at things.</p><!--
              --><p>For example, when she first learned how to rock climb, she would commit every movement her coach made to memory and ask in detail about every last maneuver.</p><!--
              --><p>Her next step was to train &mdash; and train a lot, making her body remember the trick behind each movement, gradually executing them faster and faster. She even requested someone to record the entire process with a [[Kamera]], all the better to later study any failures or areas where she wasn't fluid enough.</p><!--
              --><p>She would also talk with her coach and use various tools and equipment in order to solve problems she encountered, enumerating lists of solutions, and trying out each one in turn before choosing the best.</p><!--
              --><p>In this way, Mavuika honed her climbing skills to perfection most quickly indeed, and her questions grew ever harder for her coach to answer, eventually shifting their relationship from that of teacher and student to that of fellow lovers of climbing, delving into their craft together.</p><!--
              --><p>In other fields, there were even more exaggerated cases. In some cases, Mavuika would come to surpass "masters" with three to four decades of experience after just a single year of study.</p><!--
              --><p>The reason behind this was actually quite simple: Building up skills is easy, but maintaining progress is hard. Once memories have sunk into one's body, it becomes easy for one to grow self-satisfied and complacent, and thus cease to actively think.</p><!--
              --><p>As such, one thing Mavuika detests is repetition: If a deed done before must be done again, then it must be done differently in some way, whether by trying something new, or else through reflection and optimization.</p><!--
              --><p>But it is difficult for most to see all the effort that she puts into this, and thus, her swift progress is often put down to talent. To this, she can only wryly smile, for who in this world was born with such a surfeit of talent?</p><!--
              --><p>"If you want to improve, all you have to do is master the 'skill' of improvement and then just put in the work."</p>

|text3         = <p>Mavuika gives the impression of being a most avid outdoorswoman. When not at work or training, she can be seen in all sorts of places, throwing herself at various extreme challenges.</p><!--
              --><p>But what people often fail to realize is that she actually can also sit still for long periods of time, staying focused as she reads books and woven scrolls, as she possesses ample patience.</p><!--
              --><p>Her other great indoor hobby is solving puzzles, whether these involve logical reasoning or pattern recognition, and regardless if their contents are images, numbers, or even stories. All quickly suck her into a world of her own.</p><!--
              --><p>After enjoying time well-spent making deductions and decisions, she even scores these puzzles based on their quality, difficulty, and reasonability, so that her fellow puzzle hobbyists have a reliable standard to refer to.</p><!--
              --><p>Yet this hobby of hers came to pose a problem: Puzzle games are usually one-time sources of enjoyment and lack replayability, and Mavuika tends to solve them all too quickly, faster even than the ability of puzzle creators to develop new ones.</p><!--
              --><p>As such, while keeping an eye on any new puzzles that come to market, Mavuika also dusts off already-solved puzzles and adds various restrictions and limitations to increase the difficulty or complexity.</p><!--
              --><p>For example, while doing a puzzle, she might allow herself to select pieces normally, but flip the pieces when placing them, thus only being able to see if she has the puzzle right after placing every piece and flipping the whole thing back over.</p><!--
              --><p>Or perhaps, if the puzzle requires separating multiple connected pieces of metal, she will affix one piece to the table, thus restricting the number of directions in which she can conveniently pull the pieces apart, requiring her to consider alternatives &mdash; a restriction that can also be applied to knot puzzles.</p><!--
              --><p>Over time, she has compiled the various gameplay challenges she has come up with and puzzle ratings she has given, creating a most valuable curated catalog of puzzles.</p><!--
              --><p>At first, she published it at the Speaker's Chamber, hoping that she could help her fellow hobbyists, and also promote this relatively niche hobby while she was at it, but the quickest to seize upon the utility of the resource she created were, in fact, the sellers of puzzles.</p><!--
              --><p>They used the recommendation of the Pyro Archon herself to shamelessly peddle their puzzles, but this quickly led to numerous disputes &mdash; approval though it be, Mavuika's catalog only indicated her personal preference, while the full scope of human taste in puzzles is vast indeed.</p><!--
              --><p>Following that incident, Mavuika no longer publicly discloses her catalog, but if one truly considers oneself a puzzle enthusiast, one can still go to the Speaker's Chamber and request to view it.</p><!--
              --><p>...With the caveat that you must first prove yourself an expert by solving a random puzzle selected from Mavuika's collection by the Chamber staff, of course.</p>

              --><p>The birth of their child changed everything &mdash; Mavuika was like a small, pure, burning sun, constantly casting rays of warmth in all directions, the streaming light scattering and burning away the barriers and gloom that lay between them.</p><!--
              --><p>Young Mavuika was curious about everything and anything, and whenever her father would answer her questions, he always drew a worshipful gaze and warm, genuine smile from her, a process that gradually taught him the joys of communicating with others and sharing his thoughts.</p><!--
              --><p>While she gained knowledge from her father, Mavuika would pester her mother to bring her out on adventures every day, and on these, the brave young girl would always charge ahead, scaring her mother half to death. As this repeated time and again, her mother came to realize how her own reckless behavior must have seemed inappropriate in the eyes of others.</p><!--
              --><p>Mavuika matured faster than any other child her age, and very quickly, the knowledge she had gleaned from her father allowed her to point out her mother's rashness, and the experiences she had with her mother allowed her to identify her father's overly idealistic thinking.</p><!--
              --><p>Like a bridge, she stood between two people who could not at first communicate easily with one another, slowly dissolving the many contradictions and misunderstandings that had accumulated over time. When her father taught her martial arts, her mother would give pointers from the side, and when her mother took her to train Saurians, her father would also come along.</p><!--
              --><p>But the thing that really pushed Mavuika to take another step forward was the birth of another angel into the house &mdash; her sister, [[Hine]].</p><!--
              --><p>Perhaps it was because Mavuika had already taken on responsibilities important to the family's relationships that she quickly got used to the role of an older sister, and step by step, she passed on all that she had learned from her parents to Hine.</p><!--
              --><p>Hine was by no means easy to handle. She was naughty at times, quiet at others, and rarely obedient, which often resulted in the other three household members seated at the table simultaneously facepalming with a sigh. But even these were moments filled with warmth.</p><!--
              --><p>Once, when Mavuika and her father were teaching her, Hine asked a question:</p><!--
              --><p>"If all the Pyro Archons are just humans, how can we be sure that every person who becomes one will be willing to protect us?"</p><!--
              --><p>"It's precisely because we are all ordinary people that we don't need such guarantees."</p><!--

              --><p>Guided by an unspoken understanding, the warriors visited her Speaker's Chamber as one, offering their most important belongings to be used as "fuel" in case of any future emergencies.</p><!--
              --><p>These brave people were proud of this necessary sacrifice and did not hesitate in the least, but Mavuika called out to each of them before they could leave, offered them a hot drink, and listened to them speak of the story behind those objects.</p><!--
              --><p>She was willing to, and indeed, had to carry these stories with her into the future, for memories can surpass time where human lifespans may fail. And though these objects might not endure into the future, so long as someone still sang their stories, they could welcome the victorious dawn alongside the people of the future.</p><!--

After all, sitting on the back of that thing while Mavuika is driving is a great way to end up feeling queasy.</p>

|text8         = <p>When Mavuika was still very young, she had yet to develop a complete concept of life and death. It was at this time that her father achieved victory in the Pilgrimage, and was soon to embark on a glorious journey.</p><!--
              --><p>In the culture and traditions of Natlan, to obtain this privilege is to become a hero, and Mavuika was immensely proud of her father for having done so. Thus, when her father came to say his farewells, she couldn't really understand the disquiet on her mother's face.</p><!--
              --><p>It was very uncommon for a team fighting in the [[Night Warden Wars]] to be completely wiped out, and even should some fall, their lives' flames would be rekindled by the [[Ode of Resurrection]] so long as the unit dispatched achieved victory.</p><!--
              --><p>At last, news of victory came to the Stadium. It had been three days and nights of vicious battle, and had cost three out of seven warriors, Mavuika's father being among them.</p><!--
              --><p>Though she was somewhat worried, Mavuika knew the Rite of Rekindling to be akin to a victory feast. Her father would return to them from the Sacred Flame, just as she remembered, and their family would be reunited.</p><!--
              --><p>But, contrary to her expectations, her father was covered in wounds from head to toe, so much so that he could not even stand on his own two feet.</p><!--
              --><p>The Ode of Resurrection could rekindle life, but only the fatal wound could be reversed. The wounds that had slowly accumulated as the battle raged on or pre-existing ailments would not be cured. And it was precisely the length of the battle that had brought her father low.</p><!--
              --><p>This was the first time Mavuika had seen her father in such a weak state, and the first time she felt the gaze of "death" fixed on her. It was still a thing to be respected and feared, even with the Ode at hand.</p><!--
              --><p>Having rarely cried in her life, Mavuika held her tears back this time, too. She simply lowered her head in silence, gripping her father's hand as he lay in his sickbed, her heart filled, in truth, more with regret than sadness.</p><!--
              --><p>Perceiving her thoughts, her father told her that this was the truth of "war," that all fear death, but that some would always step forth to fight, because they had something they wished to protect.</p><!--
              --><p>But the world of children is not yet governed by so many expectations, and she did not understand why her father, and indeed, all the grown-ups, were willing to shoulder the duty of war.</p><!--
              --><p>"Since we're forced to fight this war, then I wish to put an end to it."</p><!--
              --><p>Mavuika's eyes flashed like flames as she spoke, and her parents looked at one another, some certainty dawning. They did not rush to deny that notion on account of their daughter's "naivete." Instead, they nodded.</p><!--
              --><p>Her parents' acknowledgment steeled her initial resolve, and thus did the gaze of the [[god]]s come to rest upon her. And though she would later learn many secrets and know more about the crisis that Natlan faced, she would never doubt the trust she once saw in their eyes.</p><!--
              --><p>She believed that this was something that only she could do &mdash; not only because she was "Kiongozi" Mavuika, but also because she was her parents' daughter, their pride and joy. She was a daughter of the Scions of the Canopy &mdash; a daughter of Natlan.</p>

==Trivia==
*Mavuika can be seen wielding the [[claymore]] [[Earth Shaker]], borrowed from [[Kinich]], in the [https://youtu.be/w1BaF4fd1UM Version 5.0 "Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn" Trailer] and the cutscene during {{Quest|A Decision (Archon Quest)|showType=0}}.
*As the Pyro Archon at the time, Mavuika worked with the [[Heroes of Natlan|six heroes]] during the [[cataclysm]], but she had personal connections with some of them before that.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Fuel Named "Fate"}}</ref>
**She grew up alongside [[Burkina]] within the Scions of the Canopy; when he received his [[Ancient Name]] while they were still children, she hinted to him her aspirations of becoming Pyro Archon.
**A child prodigy, she visited the home of renowned warrior trainer [[Sundjatta]] and apparently convinced him to take her on as a student.
**As an adult, she was friends with [[Wanjiru]] and had wrestling matches with her. She always won, but did lose at least once a few days before being invested with the Archon's power.
* Her Saurian companion was a baby male Yumkasaur named [[Hitata]].
*Mavuika is one of the few currently playable characters who acknowledges that the Traveler is from another world, presumably because of her status as an Archon.
*Mavuika is known by these aliases or titles:
**Kiongozi
**Lady Haborym
** Pyro Archon
** God of War
*Silhouettes of [[Chasca]], [[Iansan]], [[Mualani]], [[Kinich]], [[Ororon]], and [[Xilonen]] are present in her splash art, representing the nation's six heroes in the present-day.
* Mavuika can use a few abilities or mechanics normally limited to one tribe, some on her own, and others through the use of Flamestrider.
** Detect and uncover buried items and use [[Molten Fissure]]s.
** Takes no damage from [[Gaseous Phlogiston]] or Phlogiston Currents and the Currents will refill her Phlogiston meter, as will Scorchwind Confluxes.
** Can utilize a special [[Elemental Sight]] exclusive to characters from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] and [[Iktomisaurus|Iktomisauri]], but cannot scan nearby [[Nightspirit Graffiti]] nor utilize the following effects.
** While riding Flamestrider, she can rapidly climb, briefly glide to bridge gaps, surf & jump across [[water]] and [[Liquid Phlogiston]] without taking Pyro damage, and use [[Spiritway]]s.
* Mavuika cannot use [[Phlogiston Wind Tunnel]]s, [[Jet-Set Eddies]], or [[Spiritspeaking]] abilities. Despite being from the Scions of the Canopy, she cannot utilize [[Coilgrass Sigil]]s or other entities relating to [[Yumkasaurus|Yumkasauri]].
* Mavuika is the first and, so far, the only character in the game to not rely on energy to charge up her [[Hour of Burning Skies|Ultimate]]. Instead, she depends on [[Hour of Burning Skies|Fighting Spirit]] which is filled up whenever allies consume Nightsoul Points during their [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state or they perform Normal Attacks against enemies.
* Mavuika's idle animations will cause nearby NPCs to clap when she initiates them.
* Mavuika being born in the Huitztlan tribe, which is located in Coatepec mountain; may be a nod to the myth of the birth of the Aztec god {{w|Huitzilopochtli}}, which, according to the myths, was born in Coatepec mountain. This was also the place where he fought her sister Coyolxauhqui and his 400 Centzonuitznaua.

===Etymology=== 
*Mavuika may be named after the {{w|Māori}} fire deity {{w|Mahuika}}, who is typically depicted as female, especially given her Chinese name "玛薇卡" can be translated to "Mahuika." She is the wife of {{w|Auahitūroa}}, the god of comets and origin of fire. She is the figure from which the hero {{w|Māui}} obtained the secret of making fire.
**This is further supported by the name of her sister Hine, likely named after the goddess Mahuika's sister, {{w|Hine-nui-te-pō}}.
*{{w|Haborym}} (also called Aim or Aym in ''The Lesser Key of Solomon'') is a Great Duke of Hell. In human form he appears as a handsome man with three heads, of which belong to a serpent, a man and a cat, whilst also riding along a viper. He carries a firebrand with him, in which it is said he uses to set cities, forests, and castles ablaze.
