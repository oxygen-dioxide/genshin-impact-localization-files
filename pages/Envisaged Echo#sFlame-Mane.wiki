==Challenge Objectives==
* Defeat all opponents within the time limit

==Special Rules==
* During the "Flame-Mane" challenge, when Dehya {{Color|bp|takes DMG}}, she gains "Flamerage": Each stack of Flamerage increases her DMG by 10%, CRIT Rate by 6%, and CRIT DMG by 18%. This effect lasts for 12 seconds and can stack up to 5 times, with each stack having an independent duration.
* During the "Flame-Mane" challenge, a {{Color|bp|bolt of lightning}} dealing Electro DMG will strike at Dehya's position every 10 seconds.
* During the "Flame-Mane" challenge, Dehya will periodically regenerate Energy.
