==Profile==
After the initial failed experiment of [[Rene de Petrichor]]'s rebirth, [[Jakob Ingold]] utilized [[Carter Scherbius]]' remains and Ordo's opponents for experiments, resulting in the creation of [[Narzissenkreuz]]. The remains left were then grafted onto "those who have lost their intellect," which most likely refers to the hilichurls, in order to create Caterpillar.<ref name=":0">Interactable: [[??? (Fontaine)#Log|Log]]</ref>

Although he appears as a child, Cater is actually not a child as [[Lanoire]] explains. He initially explains that his appearance is due to an illness. Cater was first imprisoned in Meropide 400 years ago,<ref name="aeo">{{Ref/Quest|An Eye for an Eye}}</ref> after carrying out a deed for his "master" Narzissenkreuz, a powerful mage.<ref name="gotr" />

It is later revealed that Cater was a hilichurl, who was endowed with sentience and taught human speech as part of a miracle performed by his master using the mystical power of the [[Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz]].<ref name="aeo" /> He was then inducted into the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and given the moniker "Chrysalis of the Phantasmic Moth," a name which symbolized his status as a creature which turns into a chrysalis before metamorphosing into a new lifeform, as well as his master's hope that he would one day become human. Narzissenkreuz also believed that he could save Fontaine from the prophesied apocalypse. However, the plan failed, and the Ordo was disbanded.

Caterpillar does not consider himself human, going so far as to describe himself as a "monster in human skin" with an inconsistent identity, comprised of "impure elements." As such, he is currently searching for a definitive answer to his identity.

At an unknown point in his life, Caterpillar discovered the "Path of Pilgrimage", a path that the [[Oceanid]]s took from Fontaine to [[Sumeru]] in search of the former Hydro Archon [[Egeria]]. He appeared in the artist [[Julien]]'s dreams and told him of this path.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Artist Adrift (Part 2)}}</ref>

After centuries of being imprisoned in Meropide, Caterpillar met a child named Lanoire who had been born inside the fortress and barred from leaving because she lacked official identification, though she had family outside the prison. Wishing to become "more like a human" and to atone for his sins as a human would, Caterpillar befriended the girl and plotted to reunite her with her family.<ref name="aeo" /> During the events of [[Unfinished Comedy]], the Traveler helped Cater and Lanoire escape from Meropide, and bring Lanoire back to her grandfather [[Earnshaw]].

After relocating to the present-day Ordo, Cater tells [[Ann]] and [[Seymour]] that that Narzissenkreuz used the "world formula" described in [[Rene's Investigation Notes]] to calculate the arrival of an apocalypse that would end the world, and that the Doomsday Clock inside the Ordo is calibrated to count down until that moment arrives.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Riddles Awaiting Answers}}</ref>

Caterpillar, alongside the Traveler, Ann and Seymour, eventually reforge the [[Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz]] in an attempt to stop Jakob's world from being realized. He and Seymour fought against the [[Tower of Ipsissimus]]' [[Clockwork Meka]] guardians while the Traveler and Ann descended into the [[Primordial Sea]] to confront the Master. They successfully defeat the Master, who agrees to travel to the surface to see the world and make some amends. Once the group parts ways, Caterpillar decides to continue wandering to find the true meaning of his identity.

The Traveler would eventually run into Caterpillar inside [[??? (Fontaine)|???]] when checking in on [[Canotila]], where he appears to suffer from memory loss and encounters a strange dog in the realm. When the Traveler catches up to the pair, the dog asks him what it looks like in their eyes, which they claim is a puppy. The dog and Caterpillar urge them to leave, as they belong in a "brighter" world. As the Traveler is ejected out, Caterpillar asks for the dog's name, though it is not made clear. The Traveler would eventually return to the realm to find Canotila, where they defended her from an Anemo Hilichurl Rogue, highly implied to be Caterpillar, though his status is left unknown.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Pursuit (Part 2)}}</ref>

Caterpillar would eventually return to the real world and visit Lanoire for her birthday in his true form, causing her grandfather Earnshaw to panic, as it appeared to him that she had been kidnapped by a hilichurl. The Traveler and Paimon would find them, where they spent some time together. He warned her not to approach anyone who looked like him, though he also finishes the story he had told her earlier in prison before leaving.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Happy Birthday}}</ref>

===Appearance===
When disguised as a human, Caterpillar resembles a young boy with white hair and soulless eyes who wears simple clothes. The skin of his arms and legs fade into a brownish-black color from below the elbow and knees respectively. His true form is that of an [[Anemo Hilichurl Rogue]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon completing [[Initial Facts]])
:'''Caterpillar:''' Anything else you want to talk about?
:{{DIcon}} About the current situation...
::'''Caterpillar:''' It's nice that this place is so lively again after several centuries.
::'''Caterpillar:''' ...Just joking. I think there's a purpose to all this... I mean, to us gathering like this. It's boring and foolish to treat it as simple, sheer coincidence.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Our encounter has to be an omen of a kind of beginning, akin to a repressed seed struggling before fully germinating.
::'''Caterpillar:''' But on the other hand, before the actual apocalypse arrives, just who would try to find meaning in absurdity and be convinced that those signs herald that inevitable solemn moment?
::'''Caterpillar:''' Other than Narzissenkreuz, whom I used to call [[Master]]. Regardless, he deserved to be called a Grandmaster.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Just like our paths crossed here under the Doomsday Clock, if we follow along the woven path together, maybe we can...
::'''Caterpillar:''' ...
::'''Caterpillar:''' I should save the rest of that thought for the end of the journey.
:{{DIcon}} I want to know more about you, Caterpillar...
::'''Caterpillar:''' What else is there to say about myself?
::'''Caterpillar:''' I often feel mutally exclusive elements in the nature of my existence. Individually, they are pure, but also alien to each other.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Therefore, when they interact, they mix with the other and become impure. Can you understand that?
::'''Caterpillar:''' My own identity is not consistent... Sometimes I am a [[Pari|Bloomguard]], other times a [[dragon]]. My identity is a lie built out of the stories of others.
::'''Caterpillar:''' But I believe a definitive answer exists, a singular correct answer. As the hands on the clock move again, I'm ready to take that step.
:{{DIcon}} I want to know more about [[Lanoire]]...
::'''Caterpillar:''' Our time together was very short, but I never thought I'd be so committed to playing the role of a protector for her.
::'''Caterpillar:''' It was indeed a very novel experience. Perhaps I was attracted by her purity, because that's a quality I will never possess.
::'''Caterpillar:''' Yet the [[Fortress of Meropide]] is what kept her innocent... Somewhere she shouldn't have been in the first place.
::'''Caterpillar:''' To give her an opportunity to choose, the right to choose must be first stripped from her.
::'''Caterpillar:''' But whenever I think of how now, the mundane world has finally entered her heart...
::'''Caterpillar:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} We'll talk about this later.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I'll stay here until it's time for us to set out.
