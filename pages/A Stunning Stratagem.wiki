It really makes you wonder what's inside the package, but at the same time, you can't bear to eat such a beautiful-looking thing... You glance at the crystal-clear smile in Kokomi's eyes. Ah, darn it, you've fallen for her trick, haven't you?

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* While Bird's Egg Sushi is made ''nigiri'' style, A Stunning Stratagem is made ''chakin'' style. {{Lang|''Chakin-zushi''|ja=茶巾寿司}}, or sushi wrapped in a very thin egg sheet, allegedly gained its name because it is reminiscent of a teabowl wrapped by a {{Lang|''{{w|chakin}}''}}.<ref>Yushoku: [https://en.akasaka-yusyoku.com/chakin-sushi/ Chakin Sushi]</ref>
* The Chinese version uses the term {{Lang|"brocade bag"|zh=锦囊|zh_rm=jǐnnáng}} for "package" in the English description text. It is probably a pun on the Chinese idiom {{Lang|"[in a] brocade bag, [there is a] marvelous plan"|zh=锦囊妙计|zh_rm=jǐnnáng miàojì}}, meaning a "cunning contingency plan prepared in advance," which originates from the Chinese historical novel ''{{w|Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}''.<ref>NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=28016578 {{zh|闲聊杂谈:关于稻妻人名地名角色天赋命座的考据(更新珊瑚宫心海九条裟罗考据)}}]</ref>
** In the novel, this plan was devised by the strategist {{w|Zhuge Liang}} known as the "Sleeping Dragon," who may have inspired the constellation name of Sangonomiya Kokomi ("Sleeping Dragoness").
** The same word play is seen in the Chinese version of [[Watatsumi Sightseeing]], the first part of her Story Quest [[Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing]].
