{{Quest Description|Discovering the truth behind the samsara of the Sabzeruz Festival is not enough. You still need to find a way to break out of it. The good news is, you now see a glimmer of hope...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good morning, Nahida! Wait... Now that Paimon remembers everything, should we instead say, "Good morning, Lesser Lord Kusanali"?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what's wrong, Nahida? You don't look too good...
:{{DIcon}} ...Where is Dunyarzad?
:{{DIcon}} She couldn't have...!?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...I'm afraid that what you're thinking right now is correct...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did Dunyarzad already disappear? No way! Are... Are we too late?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The real Dunyarzad's consciousness has indeed disappeared. It can no longer endure the constant dream harvesting.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} We were so close...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can't believe it... Wait, so what about that other Dunyarzad? Just what is she? Is she also going to disappear?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' She's actually something like a puppet, but not completely.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The real Dunyarzad's consciousness could no longer keep playing her role in this dream...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So, another Dunyarzad appeared to replace her in the dream. Just like the grass and the trees, that Dunyarzad is just a building block of the dream that helps to keep it going.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But personality-wise, she's nothing like the real Dunyarzad...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Puppets are stiff and can't copy a living person's vitality. After all, they're just there as filler.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You know, speaking of which... The old Dunyarzad might not have been too different from a puppet.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dunyarzad truly believed that she met you within her consciousness, and it was you who inspired her... So you do remember her after all!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. Back then, her family was overly protective of her. No one cared about her personality or thoughts. It was as if she only lived to stall her [[Eleazar]].
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I just gave her a little wisdom so she could look at life in a new way... So that she could be her own person. But even so, she still...
:{{DIcon}} It still meant a lot to her.
:{{DIcon}} You are a kind archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...Far from it. I'm still a long way off from being a real archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I couldn't even save her. If I were a competent archon, I wouldn't have let my most faithful follower die at the Sabzeruz Festival with so many regrets...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Please don't beat yourself up over it, Nahida! It's the Sages' fault, and theirs alone!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I... I'm not beating myself up. All I did was to rationally observe the distance between myself and a real archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't be like that, Nahida. Even real archons are still allowed to be sad...
:'''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' To prevent more tragedies like this, we must end the samsara as soon as possible.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! But how do we do that?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Although this Sabzeruz Festival dream is under the Akasha's control, only humans can dream. Even the Akasha is unable to create them.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That means this dream belongs to a host who created it.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... So how should we find that person?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Well, if this is someone's dream, then everything here must come from deep within their consciousness ...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...Which means, with the power of imagination, they can change anything in this dream.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Imagination? What do you mean by that?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Imagination means breaking through what you perceive as normal.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Like when a server at a tavern brings a plate to you, you'd naturally assume that food is on it.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' However, if you're the dream's host and you become aware that you're dreaming, when you imagine gold and [[Mora]] on the plate...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...The dream will respond in kind, and the server really will bring you gold and Mora.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But right now, our host is unaware that this is a dream. No matter how many times they're served, it will always be food.
:{{DIcon}} So we find the host &mdash; then what?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 24.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Find some way to make that person realize that they're dreaming. Usually, once that happens, the person will wake up and the dream's samsara will be broken.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How are we going to find them, though? If it could be anyone, it'd be like looking for a needle in a haystack!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And even if we did find them, how are we supposed to make them realize they're dreaming?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, like you said... "Don't wake a sleepwalker."
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 25.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's extremely difficult, yes. But the only ones who can do it are you two. Remember, everything you've achieved up to this point has all been for the sake of finding the host and ending the samsara.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 26.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As for me... during this time, I'll be out of town.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Out of town"? Are you going to that place full of dreams where the Traveler went?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 27.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, I want to try something. There must still be a small wisp of possibility...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 nahida 28.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hurry and go. Dreams are supposed to be fantastical, romantic, and full of pleasant surprises. Unnecessary things like this samsara... need to end.
;(Nahida leaves)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Paimon's still a little upset that we've come this far, only for Dunyarzad to...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She was such a good person with such a simple wish, but fate was against her.
:{{DIcon}} I just feel so demoralized.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Saving Dunyarzad is what kept us going this whole time.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But we mustn't lose hope, Traveler! Dunyarzad would definitely want to see us save everyone else. So let's break this samsara for her sake!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's wondering... Do you think the sages would get one of their own to be the host of this dream? Feels like it would be easier to control it that way, no?
:{{DIcon}} Unlikely.
::{{DIcon}} Knowing the plan, they'd probably become aware that they were dreaming.
::{{DIcon}} An unsuspecting host would be less likely to realize this is a dream.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, that's true. Plus, the sages probably weren't counting on there being other factors beyond their control &mdash; like Nahida and us.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, who do you think the host of the dream is?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe Farris, the Knight of Flowers?
:{{DIcon}} The one with the strange get-up?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! That would make sense! Farris, the Knight of Flowers, is a symbol of the whole Sabzeruz Festival, right? Pretty core character.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 1 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go ask him some questions, shall we?
----
;(Approach Farris)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 01.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Hm? You're back. You left in a hurry last time. Is everything okay?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Everything's fine, just... Umm, it's a little hard to explain. Uh, would you mind taking part in a little experiment with us?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 02.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' An experiment? That came out of nowhere... I'm listening, though. What do you need me to do?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could you... make a wish?
:{{DIcon}} Imagine your wish coming true before your very eyes.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 03.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' You want me to make a wish? Is that a new Sabzeruz Festival tradition or something?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Less questions, more wishing!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 04.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Okay, okay...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 05.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' My wish, my wish... Um, okay, I'm a little nervous saying this out loud, but... I want Miss Dunyarzad to be happy.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 06.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' I noticed earlier that she looked a bit down, and she wasn't really talking to anyone.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 07.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' She just doesn't seem like herself. She's always so gentle and kind, and all the kids love her...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 08.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' I've also wondered if the reason she asked me to be Farris, Knight of Flowers is because I'm special to her, or something...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... you have a crush on Dunyarzad?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 09.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Uh, heh... Haha... Is it that obvious? Hmm, after what I just said, I guess it is.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 10.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' When she placed the hat of the Knight of Flowers onto my head, she said to me, "I want everyone to have a happy Sabzeruz Festival."
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 11.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' What she didn't realize was that I'm not that interested in how everyone else feels... In that moment, I just wanted to be her Knight of Flowers for the rest of my life. Fifty years, a hundred years... I'll serve her till the end of time.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 12.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' ...Okay, yeah, that was a bit much. Felt like the right moment to get it off my chest, but... ahem, that was pretty embarrassing.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 13.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Okay, I'm ready to make my wish: I would like Miss Dunyarzad to appear in front of me right now, with a smile on her face... Here goes...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Please come true...
:{{DIcon}} Please come true...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 14.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' I'm gonna open my eyes, ho-ho!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 15.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Oh... You're...!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
;(The third child is shown standing in front of Vihar)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 16.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' ...Phaki? Sorry, but only one portion of Yalda Candies per person. Back home you go.
;(Phaki leaves)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 vihar 17.ogg}} '''Vihar:''' Hahaha... Nice try, you two. Anyway, never mind, I don't need to see her appear right in front of me. As long as she's happy, hahaha...
;(The Traveler and Paimon leave)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Guess he isn't the host of this dream after all. Should've expected it wouldn't be this easy.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems like everyone who knows Dunyarzad loves her, but none of them has any idea that she...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' My lady, step back!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds like [[Dehya]]! Oh, right, this is when Dunyarzad bumps into the kidnappers.
:{{DIcon}} I'll teach them a lesson they won't forget.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But Dehya can handle them... Hey, Traveler!

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 3 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...Oh? It's you. Great timing! Please take&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Take Dunyarzad and leave.
:{{DIcon}} Leave these guys to me.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 3 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hey, this is my job. The Homayanis pay me, not you.
:{{DIcon}} You're wasting your breath.
:{{DIcon}} Leave.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 3 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' You... Ugh, alright fine, knock yourself out. Why are you so worked up anyway? It's not like I don't trust your fighting skills...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 3 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...Anyway, watch yourself.
;(Dehya and Dunyarzad leave)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 3 badis 01.ogg}} '''Badis:''' So you got yourself some back-up? Hmph, suit yourself! You're goin' down!

;(After defeating the Eremites)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Traveler... Were you just taking your anger out on those guys?
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine...
:{{DIcon}} I'm just angry at myself.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* You and Nahida both... Dunyarzad wouldn't want to see you two like this.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and speaking of her... Paimon just remembered something.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Remember how during the first Sabzeruz Festival, before the samsara started, we came here with Dunyarzad because she wanted to pick something up?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She said it was because she had forgotten something.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I do remember that.
:{{DIcon}} Ah yes. I'd forgotten all about that.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so Paimon's memory is working so far... Anyway, Paimon also remembers that she's staying somewhere around here. She pointed it out to us the night before the Sabzeruz Festival.
:{{DIcon}} Should we check out what the item is?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it'll give us some clues.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, even if it's only a tiny clue, it'll probably still help us more than this needle-in-a-haystack search...
;(The Traveler and Paimon approach the building)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is the place. It's rude to enter other people's spaces without permission, but desperate times call for desperate measures!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, the windows are unlocked. Okay, Paimon's gonna take a peek inside.

:'''Paimon enters the room and returns a while later, carrying something...'''

:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This was only a temporary residence, so there was pretty much nothing inside except this book on the table.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Should we open it?
;(Read an Elegantly-Written Note)
::'''An Elegantly-Written Note'''
::
::After almost sixteen days, I was finally able to get these notes written before the Sabzeruz Festival.
::Once the festival ends, you and Paimon will probably continue your journey immediately, so I was hoping that I'd be able to give this to you before that.
::This is a compilation of folk legends concerning Lesser Lord Kusanali, created from a series of interviews that I conducted in succession and wrote down.
::I interviewed so many people, but I'm afraid that there are very few who know much about her...
::Still, I hope that this will be of use to you in your search for her.
::
::"Gandarva Ville's water supply was once contaminated, forcing everyone to go very far out to get water. But one day, people suddenly found that the water was drinkable again, and some said that a green light was seen near the water's source the previous night. Everyone believes that this was the divine power of Lesser Lord Kusanali at work."
::This sounds quite possible. The decontamination of water sources via natural means probably takes ages. Did Lesser Lord Kusanali appear in [[Gandharva Ville]], then?
::
::"After Mama passed away, I was super afraid of the dark and couldn't sleep. But from one day on, I would hear a voice that would chat with me till I fell asleep. A nice lady told me that Lesser Lord Kusanali must've been watching over me."
::Poor child. I hope that the Sabzeruz Festival makes him a little happier. This is quite similar to something I experienced back then, as well. She is indeed a gentle god.
::
::"There was this one time when I'd had a wee bit too much to drink and couldn't find my way home to save my life. Then, when I turned a corner, I could've sworn I saw Lesser Lord Kusanali. She was very tall and had the most muscular arms, and she caught me when I slipped and fell. The next morning, I found myself sleeping under a tree. I reckon that must've been her looking out for me!"
::Hmm... I'm not sure this one has that much value as a reference. That was probably just a tree, right?"
::
::(These folk records, appended with Dunyarzad's references and opinions, leave every page densely packed.)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... Dunyarzad wrote all of this. Sounds like she was always thinking of us, even while we were away...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even though she was also busy preparing for the Sabzeruz Festival, and had all her health problems to worry about...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She must have wanted to give this to us as a gift on the day of the Sabzeruz Festival, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we hadn't found this book, we never would have known...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But now that we know, we can't even thank her...
:{{DIcon}} Dunyarzad...
;(The Traveler runs off)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, where are you off to now?
----
;(Approach Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's Dunyarzad's puppet...
:{{DIcon}} (I guess...)
::{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} (I'll feel better if I say this out loud...)
::{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{color|menu|Despite all your efforts, you could not save Dunyarzad. You sit on the bench, seized by mixed feelings.}}
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Traveler...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You must be exhausted.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come to think of it, we've been stuck in this place for a really, really long time. Heck, even the last time we were chatting happily with Dunyarzad feels like an eternity ago...
;(The Traveler looks around and sees memories of them with Paimon and a visibly happy Dunyarzad)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon still remembers when we were sitting here, and the way her eyes sparkled when she talked about Nilou's Dance of Sabzeruz...
:{{DIcon}} ...I can barely recall it now.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' ...There will always be frustrations in life, but I know that the point of living is to not leave behind any regrets.
:{{DIcon}} !?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was what the real Dunyarzad said, wasn't it? Does that mean...!?
:{{DIcon}} Dunyarzad...?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Yes, Traveler? What is it?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... So she's still just a puppet. But just now... How come...
:{{DIcon}} Not leave behind any regrets...
:{{DIcon}} Let's go, Paimon.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? Where are we going this time?
:{{DIcon}} To watch the Dance of Sabzeruz.
----
;(Approach Nilou)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 setare 01.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' If you continue to resist, we will have to order an investigation into every single event organizer...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 setare 02.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' The Grand Sage has already granted you much leniency. I advise that you exercise tact.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' How... How did things turn out like this...
:{{color|menu|You stand in front of Nilou}}
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ahh... Traveler? You don't have to get involved. He's a sage from the Akademiya. I don't want to drag you into this...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 azar 01.ogg}} '''Azar:''' ...Traveler?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Traveler, what the heck are you doing!? If you get arrested by the Akademiya, that's another day gone to waste!
:'''Azar:''' ...
:'''Setaria:''' ...
;(Paimon waves in front of Azar)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... They're not reacting! Have they been scared stiff...?
:{{DIcon}} Just like I thought...
:{{DIcon}} They're puppets.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, of course! If this is the sages' plan, they wouldn't put themselves through this...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So they're just substitutes.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' What is this? What happened to the Grand Sage and his entourage?
:{{color|menu|You notice the purple Padisarahs on the stage.}}
:{{DIcon}} Hold on a moment...
:{{DIcon}} What's up with those flowers!?
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, like I said, they symbolize the Goddess of Flowers, after all. It's just a shame that all the real [[Padisarah]]s went extinct after her death.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Yes. The Greater Lord brought forth new Padisarahs in memory of the Goddess of Flowers, but she ultimately could never truly replicate that beautiful shade of purple.
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ahh, "that beautiful shade of purple"... Aren't these flowers real Padisarahs, just like the ones from the legend? I didn't even notice! Dunyarzad, did you find these?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But didn't you just say all the real flowers went extinct after the Goddess of Flowers passed away? So how...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yeah. What's going on here...?
:{{DIcon}} Nilou, close your eyes.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Huh?
:{{DIcon}} Imagine that the Grand Sage and his entourage are not here in front of you.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You guys are acting weird... But okay, I'll try.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 09.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mmm...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 10.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hey~
;(Azar and Setaria rapidly fade out)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;They disappeared! So Nilou's the host. What a surprise!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Purple Padisarahs don't exist in the real world anymore, but in Nilou's subconscious, they can appear as decorations on the stage.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just like the example Nahida told us. People assume there will be food on a plate, and Nilou assumed there would be real Padisarahs in the flower pots.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So when you saw the flowers, you instantly knew it was Nilou?
:{{DIcon}} Correct.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if we want to end the samsara, we need the host to become aware that they're dreaming.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How should we make Nilou realize that...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 11.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Am I dreaming?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{DIcon}} How did you come to that conclusion?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 12.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, so I'm right? Is this Lesser Lord Kusanali responding to our celebration of the Sabzeruz Festival?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wrong guess, but you aren't completely wrong, either... The point is, what made you think this is a dream?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As far as you know, people in Sumeru don't dream, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 13.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yeah, but have you heard the tale of the First Sage? To prevent a calamity, he went on a journey to find the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, sounds familiar! Dunyarzad told us a story like that when we first arrived in Sumeru City. So it was about the First Sage, huh?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 14.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yep, but in the part you heard, he hadn't become the First Sage yet. There's more to the story...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 15.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' His piety and wisdom were acknowledged by the Dendro Archon, and she finally gave her blessing to him.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 16.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' All kinds of spectacular scenes appeared in front of the First Sage, as if all the knowledge in the world was being painted onto a canvas right before him. He was captivated.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 17.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' After who knows how long, he mastered all the knowledge he could comprehend.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 18.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Afterward, he said to the Dendro Archon, "I miss my parents, my wife, and my children. I've been away from home for far too long. They must be worried."
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 19.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' The Dendro Archon smiled. The next second, the sage found himself lying in his bed, as if he had just woken up from a dream.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 20.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' His wife, lying next to him, said: "You're off to search for the Dendro Archon today, aren't you? Have a safe journey, my love."
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 21.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' In the end, the First Sage took care of many disasters in Sumeru City and founded the Akademiya. What a happy ending!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... The First Sage was dreaming ever since the beginning of the story? He never went on his journey?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 22.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yes, but his faith and determination were conveyed to the Dendro Archon, so she blessed him in the form of a dream.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon understands where you're coming from now. That's a really interesting connection... But we really gotta wake up soon, like the sage in the story.
:{{DIcon}} Now that Nilou is aware of it...
:{{DIcon}} This dream should be over soon.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 23.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I see. Well, it just so happens that today's Sabzeruz Festival is almost over, too.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 6 nilou 24.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Since we're in a dream, let's make this final Dance of Sabzeruz as beautiful as we can!
:{{DIcon}} I've been waiting a long time for this.
:{{DIcon}} Please dance your heart out.
;(A [[#Cinematic|Cinematic]] plays)
{{Cutscene Description|The music comes on, and Nilou performs the Dance of Sabzeruz before it all ends. Many people gather in front of the stage. While the performance continues, the oneiric world begins to fade. You seem to see Dunyarzad, who watches Nilou's dance with glee, a satisfied smile on her face.<br />The merry music stops, and it is time to wake up from the dream.}}
::'''Nilou:''' The wait is over, everyone!
::'''Nilou:''' I dedicate this dance to our god... the Dance of Sabzeruz!
:;(In the middle of the dance, a flashback briefly occurs)
:::'''Dunyarzad:''' I'd be lying if I said I had no regrets
:::'''Dunyarzad:''' I would have loved to see Nilou's dance
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn* Good morning, Traveler. Paimon feels like she's been asleep for the longest time...
:{{DIcon}} Good morning, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} My head hurts.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Paimon's head feels super heavy. Did we oversleep? ...Do you even remember going to sleep last night?
:{{A|vo xmaq014 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks it was... after the Sabzeruz Festival...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* The Sabzeruz Festival!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have we finally escaped from the Sabzeruz samsara?
:{{DIcon}} I remember now!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quick, take off your Akasha Terminal!
:{{DIcon}} At the end of the Dance of Sabzeruz, I think I saw...
:{{DIcon}} Quick, let's go see Dunyarzad!
;(The Traveler and Paimon run to Dunyarzad's accomodation)
:{{A|vo xmaq014 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's not in her room. What happened?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go to the usual spot!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What usual spot?
----
;(Approach Dunyarzad near the [[Bimarstan's Proverb Column]])
:{{A|vo xmaq014 8 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne?:''' Well done, Traveler and Paimon.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 8 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Katheryne?:''' And... Thank you, Dunyarzad, for organizing the Sabzeruz Festival for me.
:{{A|vo xmaq014 8 dunyarzad 01.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I'm sorry, who are&mdash;
:{{A|vo xmaq014 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dunyarzad! *sniff* *sniff* You're okay! Oh, don't scare us like that...
:{{DIcon}} Dunyarzad...
:{{A|vo xmaq014 8 dunyarzad 02.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' Oh! Traveler, Paimon! I have something amazing to tell you!
:{{A|vo xmaq014 8 dunyarzad 03.ogg}} '''Dunyarzad:''' I just had a dream... and I saw Nilou performing the Dance of Sabzeruz!
