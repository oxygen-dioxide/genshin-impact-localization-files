'''Crystalfly Trap''' is a gadget used to lure and capture [[Crystalflies]]. It can be placed in the world and can produce 15 [[Crystal Core]]s each week.

The trap can be set up anywhere in the world, and requires 30 [[Mineral]]s to activate each time. Once placed, the time left may be checked through the [[Inventory]] or the {{Icon|customfile=Item Crystalfly Trap Map Icon.png}} icon on the [[Map]] where the trap was set. Returning once it has completed will reward the player with 15 Crystal Cores.

The amount of Crystal Cores obtained is not influenced by where it is placed.

==Description==
{{Description|A Crystalfly Trap, developed by a senior researcher named Fawitzki from [[Fontaine Research Institute|Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering]].<br>At the time, the Research Institute believed the research to be completely worthless, and so sold the patent to [[The Steambird]] for a pittance. The Steambird in turn wished to try to use the [[Crystal Core]]s to manufacture flash bulbs for [[Kamera]]s, but the research failed due to technical challenges.|[[Archive]]}}
