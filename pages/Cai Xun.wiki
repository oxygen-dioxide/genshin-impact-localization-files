{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Cai Xun:''' Welcome to Liyue. How may the Millelith be of service to you today?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the Millelith.
::'''Cai Xun:''' "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fall; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."
::'''Cai Xun:''' The Millelith are under the [[Liyue Qixing]]'s command. You could say we're the city's public security officers.
::'''Cai Xun:''' We're here to handle minor matters such as theft and other disturbances of the peace. We also stand ready as Liyue's firm shield in the case of a monster attack.
::'''Cai Xun:''' Never hesitate to call on us if you need assistance of any kind.
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen someone who looks very much like me?
::'''Cai Xun:''' Hmm, this is a difficult question to answer.
::'''Cai Xun:''' It's not that I'm lazy and don't observe the people who come and go, but...
::'''Cai Xun:''' Liyue Harbor is the most prosperous city among the seven nations. There are just too many people who move to and from it every day &mdash; it's impossible to remember them all.
::'''Cai Xun:''' I'll help you keep a lookout, but don't get your hopes too high...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Cai Xun:''' While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
