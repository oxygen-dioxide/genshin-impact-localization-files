'''Helen''', the self-proclaimed bard, can be seen playing on a balcony near the entrance to the [[City of Mondstadt]] during the daytime.

She thinks that ever since the sound of her lyre started filling the air of the city, the [[Stormterror]] problem got solved, therefore reinforcing her belief that perhaps, she's blessed by Barbatos.

She can give the Mondstadt [[Reputation]] Request [[Helen's Special Blend]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Helen:''' *clears throat* ...
:'''Helen:''' ...Um, excuse me? I was about to begin my song... I'm trying to protect Mondstadt here, this had better be important.
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
::'''Helen:''' Oh, you're looking for someone, huh? Off the top of my head... no, nothing springs to mind.
::'''Helen:''' I've duly noted your appearance, though. In the future, whenever I'm performing from somewhere high up, I'll keep an eye out for this missing person.
::'''Helen:''' That's another advantage of being high up, in case you didn't know. You can see really far.
:{{DIcon}} Why the high stage?
::'''Helen:''' Uh... the higher up you are, the further the sound travels. Everyone knows that... don't they?
::'''Helen:''' So if I'm on a high perch, everyone in the city will be able to hear my song.
::'''Helen:''' ...I actually wanted to do it on top of the statue of Barbatos, but the nuns stopped me. And they said if they caught me trying again, they'd put the [[Knights of Favonius]] onto me...
:{{DIcon}} Protecting Mondstadt?
::'''Helen:''' Well of course! Ever since I started performing my songs here, everything in Mondstadt has really cleared up. Obviously that's because of my efforts, right?
::'''Helen:''' Maybe I'm a bard blessed by Barbatos... Hehehe...
::'''Helen:''' ...You know, I bet if Barbatos was a bard, our skills would be equally matched!
::{{DIcon}} So where were you when Stormterror attacked?
::'''Helen:''' Hmm? Uh... Ah yes, Stormterror. I was, uh...
::'''Helen:''' That's right &mdash; I was at home, singing and playing away. And a short while afterwards, the storm stopped.
::'''Helen:''' So it seems Stormterror isn't that powerful when faced with the sound of my song.
::'''Helen:''' ...Now, where did I get up to? This is all your fault! I've forgotten the lyrics now...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Helen:''' May the Wind of Mondstadt be with you... And the sound of my song, too!
