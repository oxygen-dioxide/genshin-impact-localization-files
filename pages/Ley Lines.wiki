{{Description|A mysterious network that links the whole world together, within which flow the elements. It's said the Ley Lines remember all things that happen in this world, from the surface down to the deepest depths...|[[Loading Screen]]}}
The '''Ley Lines''' are a network of elemental energy and memories of everything that has lived in this world, both on the [[Teyvat|surface]] and down in the [[Abyss]].<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Ley Lines}}</ref>

On the surface, at the extremities of the ley lines, [[Ley Line Blossom]]s can be formed at [[Ley Line Outcrops]], deposits generated from the impeded flow of elemental energy. They use people's will as their fertile soil in which to grow. They feed on elemental energy and can be revitalized with [[Original Resin]] in order to receive treasures, as the original resins are abundant with elemental energy absorbed from the natural environment.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Ley Line Blossom}}</ref><ref>[[Map]], Interactible: [[Ley Line Outcrops]]</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Original Resin}}</ref>

In [[Domains]], [[Irminsul]] trees are the instruments through which the ley lines flow. As the domains are built around these trees, the overwhelming elemental energy that surges through them causes [[Ley Line Disorders]], which make the elements behave in an unpredictable way. Just like the blossoms, Irminsul trees can be revitalized with original resins in order to receive treasures.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Petrified Trees}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Loading|Ley Line Disorders}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The concept originates from the pseudoscientific belief that historical sites and landmarks are interconnected along deliberate alignments called "{{w|Ley line|ley lines}}", which are thought to be paths channeling spiritual energy.
