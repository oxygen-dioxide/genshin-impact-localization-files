For most of the attacks below, the core will be exposed for a few seconds after the boss uses the attack. Use this opportunity to deal damage to the boss.

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Sheer Cold Acceleration
|desc_1 = Being near the Cryo Hypostasis accelerates the rate of [[Sheer Cold]] accumulation by '''200%'''.

|name_2 = Plunging Ice Shards
|file_2 = Cryo Hypostasis Icy Spikes
|desc_2 = Creates a barrier of piercing icicles around itself while spawning icicles where the player is standing with a short delay, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}. Icicles do not target the player while inside the barrier. Dodge by either periodically dashing around the edge of the arena or running inside the barrier.

|name_3 = Ice Ring Waltz
|file_3 = Cryo Hypostasis Frost Wheel
|desc_3 = Transforms into a wheel that travels in a straight line towards the player and deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on hit. This attack may turn up to three times.

|name_4 = Icespike Shot
|file_4 = Cryo Hypostasis Homing Icicles
|desc_4 = Flies into the air and forms a rhombus with its shell pieces before firing each of them at the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}. The trajectory of these projectiles is curved, but can be dodged by dashing under the Hypostasis during the attack. The core is exposed during this attack.

|name_5 = Crystalline Skirt
|desc_5 = Forms a "skirt" of icicles which it shoots out in three rings of increasing diameter, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}. The final ring leaves behind a short-lived ring of frost that deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to characters stepping on it.

|name_6 = Clap
|desc_6 = Flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} in front of the wall.

|name_7 = Sternfrost Prism
|file_7 = Cryo Hypostasis Glacial Shield
|desc_7 = When HP is low (5%), teleports to the center of the arena and forms a {{Color|Cryo|[[Frozen#Frozen Element|Frozen]]}} shield around itself. While maintaining this state, lobs several Frostfruits around the arena, dealing '''25% ATK''' as  {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on landing. while regenerating '''5%''' of its Max HP every 3s. '''Homing Icicles''' will be fired periodically during this phase. If a [[Charged Attack]] is used on a Frostfruit, it will be sent rolling towards the Cryo Hypostasis to damage the Hypostasis' shield by '''40''' GU. When the Hypostasis has recovered '''50%''' of its Max HP, it will stop healing. It will resume attacking after it has launched one more wave of icicles once it has ceased healing.
* If this is the second time it is using this ability, it will only recover '''2.5%''' of its Max HP every 3s, and it will stop healing after recovering '''25%''' of its Max HP. From the third time onwards, it will only recover '''1%''' of its Max HP every 3s, and it will stop healing after recovering '''10%''' of its Max HP.
* If the Shield is destroyed, the Cryo Hypostasis will be stunned for 15s with its core exposed. If its HP drop below 5% during this period, it will be automatically defeated regardless of whether it had HP remaining.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Cryo|88}}

|name_8 = Icicle Barrage
|desc_8 = While attempting to revive, if the player is close, shoots out a barrage of icicles, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.

===Hypostatic Symphony===
In the [[Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse]] Event, the Cryo Hypostasis gains the following new or modified abilities:
{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy  = Cryo Hypostasis Event

|name_1 = Plunging Ice Shards
|file_1 = Cryo Hypostasis Event Icy Spikes
|desc_1 = Icicle spikes will spawn much more rapidly.

|name_2 = Icespike Shot
|file_2 = Cryo Hypostasis Event Homing Icicles
|desc_2 = Each icicle will split into 3 mini icicles shortly after being fired, each dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on hit.

|name_3 = Crystalline Skirt
|desc_3 = In addition to the original attack, homing icicles will be fired, each dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on hit.

|name_4 = Sternfrost Prism
|file_4 = Cryo Hypostasis Event Glacial Shield
|desc_4 = The Cryo Hypostasis will shoot 5 Frostfruits per wave instead of 3. 1 or 2 layers of 3 protective barriers capable of blocking Frostfruits will appear and rotate around the Hypostasis. The defensive barriers are {{Frozen}} objects that can be damaged by [[Elemental Reactions]] or [[Blunt Attack]]s, and are weakest to {{Pyro}}. Additionally, hitting a defensive barrier with a Frostfruit will also damage it by 6 Gauge Units.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

==Strategy==
* Use the three [[Ruin Brazier]]s around the arena to remove [[Sheer Cold]].
* Due to its innate elemental status, the Cryo Hypostasis is susceptible to [[Melt]] when attacked by {{Pyro}} characters, allowing them to deal increased DMG.
* During the revival phase, staying close to the Cryo Hypostasis while it fires its Frostfruits will result in them landing closer to each other, making it easier to launch all 3 of them towards the Hypostasis before they expire.
* Frostfruits move in the opposite direction from the side that receives a hit. Therefore, the player must be sure to hit the side of a Frostfruit that is not facing the Cryo Hypostasis in order to send the it in the right direction.
* [[Aimed Shot]]s that are not fully charged still count as Charged Attacks and will move the Frostfruits. This is the fastest and most Stamina-efficient method to launch Frostfruits.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A [[Skyfrost Nail|great nail]] fell down to Dragonspine in a bygone era, and has been pouring energy into the Ley Lines here ever since. Who knows what strange new phenomena might occur on the mountain when the nail is dislodged?|[[Adventurer Handbook]], before unlocking Cryo Hypostasis}}
{{Description|Code name: Daleth. A high-purity [[Cryo]] entity.<br>Research suggests that there are subtle differences between elemental hypostases and other elemental life forms in terms of their physical composition. Perhaps these differences can account for their high level of homeostasis and their almost mechanical movements.|[[Adventurer Handbook]] and [[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Each of the Hypostases are named after one of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, with {{Lang|"Daleth"|he=דּ|he_rm=Dalet}} being named after the fourth letter.
* Firing a [[Frostflake Arrow]] with [[Ganyu]] at the ceiling of the cavern underneath will trigger the Cryo Hypostasis battle. However, this is believed to be a bug.
* The Cryo, [[Hydro Hypostasis|Hydro]] and [[Pyro Hypostasis]] have rounded corners and appear intact as opposed to the sharp corners and decayed state of the rest.
