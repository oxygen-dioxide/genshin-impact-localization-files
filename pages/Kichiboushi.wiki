==Profile==
Kichiboushi is a bake-danuki who gave Ioroi company. He was sealed alongside many of his kin by [[Kamuna Harunosuke]]; however, as Harunosuke did not properly seal all of the bake-danuki away, some of them were able to escape their confinement, Kichiboushi being one of them. During the events of cleansing the Sacred Sakura, [[Ioroi]] has Kichiboushi bring the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] bring them to the corrupted Sakura roots underneath [[Chinju Forest]].

Some time afterwards, Paimon and Traveler decided to visit Ioroi on a whim. Ioroi, remarking on the other lands he saw prior to his petrification and that he had no knowledge of them, decided to have Kichiboushi accompany the two outside Inazuma as he was excited to play with them again and wanted to train more. When the Traveler remarked that they wanted to talk with Kichiboushi during their travels, Ioroi gave them a bake-danuki feast so they could understand what Kichibouchi was saying. The training mostly consisted of taking Kichiboushi around various places across [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]].

At the end of the trip, Kichiboushi was brought back to Chinju Forest and promised to uphold and remember what the Traveler and Paimon had taught him.

===Personality===
Upon receiving the power to communicate to bake-danuki from Ioroi, the Traveler and Paimon discover that Kichiboushi has an all-around eager and playful personality. Despite this, he is serious when it comes to training, as he hopes to become stronger so he could break Ioroi free from the stone confinement that Harunosuke put him in.

Due to living in Inazuma for most of his life and playing with other tanuki, Kichiboushi is unused to human customs and manners, being told by the Traveler and Paimon that it is impolite to laugh at others' expense.

He also has a habit of giving others nicknames due to having difficulty remembering and/or pronouncing names correctly, initially calling the Traveler "Yellow Fur" and Paimon "White Fur".

===Appearance===
Kichiboushi is a lighter-colored variant of the typical [[Bake-Danuki|bake-danuki]]. Unlike other bake-danuki, he has a reddish-orange leaf upon his head. He has a green patterned cape tied around his neck. His belly is a pale shade of beige, and his hands and feet are black. His inner face and ears are a dark brown, with his inner face having white markings around the sides.
