==Summary==
;The Glede Returns to the Pavilion

A few days later, the Traveler and Paimon prepare to enact Xianyun's plan to help Gaming and his father reconcile. Catching up with him in Liyue Harbor, they have a short chat before Longzhou informs him that they have a commission to escort a tea merchant and his wares for an "important client" in the city. As they set off, they soon discover that the merchant they're escorting is actually Gaming's father, [[Yip Tak]]. Due to the strained relationship, Gaming only asks Tak if everything is set and good to go. They head to Wangshu Inn and take a short moment of respite as Gaming stands guard. Suddenly, two bandits, Houzhang and Jiehu, ambush them and demand the goods. Gaming tells the Traveler to take his father and the goods away, much to Tak's worry as the two "bandits" flee. Tak is worried about his son's safety, not wanting him to be put in a dangerous situation as Cloud Retainer observes, seeing everything is going according to plan.

Making their way further down, they soon run into [[Zhongli]], much to Paimon's surprise as he wasn't part of the plan. Tak urges Zhongli to run as bandits are running around in broad daylight, much to his surprise, but Paimon begins coughing in an inconspicuous attempt to inform him of Cloud Retainer's plan. They stop by a tea stall and Paimon explains that Tak is worried about his son, who is also the guard escorting him. Zhongli, having heard of Gaming, tells Tak that he's very skillful and encapsulates the spirit of the suanni, despite such dancers having their own hardships hidden away from the viewers. He states that his perseverance in the face of adversity is admirable and that he should be proud of his son, as he had also heard from his associates that Gaming is also kind, selfless and courageous. Tak concedes that his son is a hard worker, but states his worries over his current occupation, as he fears that he would not be able to work as he grew older and was going to dangerous places, regretting showing him a wushou dance when he was younger. Zhongli informs him about a friend of his who has several "daughters" of her own, allowing them to let them forge their own path, likening it to a kite in that holding them too tight would prevent them from growing themselves. 

Gaming returns, having immediately suspected that the two "bandits" were actually sent by them as he discovered that their mannerisms and skill were far too unusual and were meant to distract him. Paimon insists that he try to talk with his father, and he reluctantly decides to do so, believing that it would be the same as their other conversations. Zhongli takes his leave and asks the Traveler and Paimon to see him off.

A fair distance away, Paimon thanks Zhongli for picking up on the situation before asking him why they were further away than usual. He simply states that a friend was coming, soon revealed to be [[Xiao]]. As Xiao was relaxing, he saw a ghostly kite in the sky and believed that [[Hu Tao]] was strolling around, only to be surprised when he saw that it was Zhongli instead. Zhongli was helping Hu Tao test the new and traditional kites, along with fetching some ingredients for her. He asks him to help out with the kites, and after some testing, Xiao informs him that the mechanical kite was superior in speed. Xiao is impartial to the contest, though he admits that the kites give him a certain peace of mind. He then tells the Traveler to meet him at [[Pervases' Temple]] if they have the chance after the Lantern Rite as the group separates. 

Back at the tea stall, Gaming and Tak try to start a conversation, though before he could go further in his decision to stay in the harbor, Xianyun and Shenhe arrive and sit down on another table. Shenhe intentionally embarrasses herself with awkward talk in order for them to continue their conversation. Tak tells Gaming that he doesn't support the idea of him living in the harbor because he feels that living there could be too hard for him, whereas at home his family would be willing to help him. Gaming notes that his father would have never told him this before they resume their trip to the harbor.

Finally arriving at the harbor, the group meets up with Charlotte, the "important client" that Longzhou had mentioned. Charlotte states that Fontanians are also big tea drinkers and that she would like to interview him about his wares, something which he had not anticipated but agrees to. Gaming is impressed by the Traveler's connections before Xianyun calls them over, causing him to realize that everything was an act but is impressed by how Xianyun was looking out for him. As she states the next step would begin, Gaming is worried that they were going to buy the tea from his father as they had pooled their Mora to buy it, but Paimon tells him that Charlotte would bring it back to Fontaine, which coupled with her article would result in new business and customers from abroad for the tea. Gaming then tells them that he has a plan of his own, so they split up to start it.

The Traveler and Paimon head back to Zhenyuan's stall to buy a Mechanical Vertical Lifting Device to install on their kite, but she insists on giving them one free of charge; their speedy assistance in delivering the kite materials allowed her daughter and mother to enjoy kite building together that same day. As the Lantern Rite starts, some of the lanterns suddenly begin to darken, but it is revealed to be a wushou performance by Gaming, who impresses the crowd with his skills and receives a round of applause from them. The audience then sets their kites out in the wind, but they soon begin to fall from a lack of current. Xianyun then uses her adepti powers to send out her own kite and catch all the other kites in its wake, making all the kites soar even higher. As Gaming returns to the pier, he finds his father and Shuyu with the suanni kite. Tak asks him if he's serious about becoming a professional wushou dancer, which he confirms. Having seen his performance and perseverance, Tak has finally changed his mind, addresses him and son and states that he is a great kid. Gaming is touched by his father's change of heart and hugs him in response before he notices the Traveler and Paimon. The Traveler asks Gaming what he would like to do, and he decides that he should thank everyone who helped him, get together and fly a kite.
