;Autumn Crisis<nowiki>:</nowiki> Expulsion
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Autumn Crisis Expulsion 1.png
|text1  = During Autumn Crisis: Expulsion, you must expel Forest Boars in a certain area, and you can only use your Normal Attack to do so. The expulsion of different species of boars will grant different numbers of points, and once time is up, they will all add to your overall score.
|image2 = Tutorial Autumn Crisis Expulsion 2.png

;Autumn Crisis<nowiki>:</nowiki> Capture
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Autumn Crisis Capture 1.png
|text1  = During Autumn Crisis: Capture, you must use Sneak and Hunting Nets to capture a certain number of animals. The animals that can be captured within this area are: {{Color|help|Scarletbeak Ducks, White Pigeons, Crimson Foxes, and Forest Boars}}.
|image2 = Tutorial Autumn Crisis Capture 2.png
|text2  = Animals in the challenge have an alertness value that, once full, will cause them to enter an alerted state, causing the difficulty of capturing them to increase. Sneak in special bushes around the area to not cause their alertness to increase.
|image3 = Tutorial Autumn Crisis Capture 3.png
|text3  = Lures will be present in the area that can be interacted with up close or activated using a Hunting Net to attract the attention of nearby animals. At the same time, dry branches and leaves that will make louder noises when stepped on will be present in the area. They can startle animals, increasing their alertness.
}}

;Autumn Crisis<nowiki>:</nowiki> Uproot
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Autumn Crisis Uproot 1.png
|text1 = During Autumn Crisis: Uproot, you must defeat the Great Snowboar King and temporarily restrain it. When the Great Snowboar King first enters the battle, it will be in an enraged state, whereupon you must use the various devices within the area, such as Hunter's Shields and Traps, to get the Snowboar King out of that enraged state.
|image2 = Tutorial Autumn Crisis Uproot 2.png
|text2 = The amount of DMG that can be done to the Great Snowboar King using Normal Attacks is quite limited. When the Great Snowboar King leaves its enraged state, the Hunting Net can deal more damage to it.
