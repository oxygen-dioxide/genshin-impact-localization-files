{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zadra:''' It will take only one hour to walk around this place. The time left can be used to...
:{{DIcon}} Hey, are you...
::'''Zadra:''' Oh, hey there. I'm planning my itinerary.
::'''Zadra:''' Before I arrived in Fontaine, I did have a plan ready. But I just met a nice person named [[Cheriez]], and it seems that I'll now have to make some adjustments.
::'''Zadra:''' You see, there's an art to even setting up a tour itinerary. It must be fresh and innovative, but it also needs to be rigorously managed, and you need to adapt to the situation on the ground.
::'''Zadra:''' Now that I think about it, even filling out a form has gained an element of fun...
:{{DIcon}} I shan't bother you further, then.
::'''Zadra:''' It's no issue. I was just studying my travel plans, that's all.
