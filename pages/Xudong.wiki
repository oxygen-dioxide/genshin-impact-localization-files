'''Xudong''' {{Lang|zh=旭东|zh_rm=Xùdōng}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] from [[Liyue]] who is first met in [[Inazuma]]. He is the unofficial leader of the [[Gourmet Supremos]], a food-focused group consisting of himself, [[Julie]], and [[Parvaneh]].

The three are the focus of [[The Gourmet Supremos]] [[World Quests]] and [[Commissions]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Xudong hails from Liyue and is a particularly renowned chef; he specializes in recreating popular dishes using cheap, accessible ingredients &mdash; and still making it taste nearly identical to the original version.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: Foodie Quiz}}</ref> He had a rivalry with [[Chef Mao]], [[Xiangling]]'s father, and their cook-off ended in a stalemate. He then began traveling across Liyue, then across [[Teyvat]], to look for inspiration and a breakthrough.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: Breakthrough Thinking}}</ref> At some point during his travels, he met Parvaneh and Julie, and they formed the Gourmet Supremos.

After arriving in Inazuma, they were able to get through the [[Kanjou Commission]] and leave [[Ritou]]. However, their attempts to experiment with local cuisine ground to a halt when they discovered that, without the ability to channel [[Electro]] energy, they were unable to collect [[Sakura Bloom]]s. Shortly thereafter, the [[Traveler]] appears before them, and the three enlist the Traveler to help them obtain special ingredients they could not, in exchange for food and recipes.

Over the course of [[The Gourmet Supremos]] quests and commissions, the Gourmet Supremos and the Traveler meet [[Kamei Munehisa]]. Despite Parvaneh's misgivings about the vagrant former samurai, Xudong decides to hire him out of empathy for Munehisa's food situation.
