'''Xudong''' {{Lang|zh=旭东|zh_rm=Xùdōng}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] from [[Liyue]] who is first met in [[Inazuma]]. He is the unofficial leader of the [[Gourmet Supremos]], a food-focused group consisting of himself, [[Julie]], and [[Parvaneh]].

The three are the focus of [[The Gourmet Supremos]] [[World Quests]] and [[Commissions]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Xudong hails from Liyue and is a particularly renowned chef; he specializes in recreating popular dishes using cheap, accessible ingredients &mdash; and still making it taste nearly identical to the original version.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: Foodie Quiz}}</ref> He ran his own restaurant<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: Cook-Off}}</ref> and had a rivalry with [[Chef Mao]], [[Xiangling]]'s father, but their cook-off ended in a stalemate. Wanting to start traveling across [[Teyvat]] to look for inspiration and a breakthrough,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: Breakthrough Thinking}}</ref>, he custom ordered a cast iron wok from [[Hanfeng's Ironmongers]], designed for tossing and said to have materials from [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] added in, making it extremely durable. When there was a problem he couldn't overcome on his own, he would head to town and look for an [[Adventurer]] or post a [[Commission]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Gourmet Supremos, Assemble!}}</ref>

While still in Liyue, he met Parvaneh and after a few conversations about their related goals, they decided to travel together. Their first destination abroad would be [[Mondstadt]], where Julie ran across them being threatened by monsters and helped them chase them off. After learning about their goals, she also joined them and they formed the Gourmet Supremos.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: The Importance of Eating Well}}</ref>

After arriving in Inazuma, they were able to get through the [[Kanjou Commission]] and leave [[Ritou]]. However, their attempts to experiment with local cuisine ground to a halt when they discovered that, without the ability to channel [[Electro]] energy, they were unable to collect [[Sakura Bloom]]s. Shortly thereafter, the [[Traveler]] came across them, and the three enlist the Traveler to help them obtain special ingredients they could not, in exchange for food and recipes.

Over the course of [[The Gourmet Supremos]] quests and commissions, the Gourmet Supremos and the Traveler meet [[Kamei Munehisa]]. Despite Parvaneh's misgivings about the vagrant former samurai, Xudong decides to hire him out of empathy for Munehisa's food situation.
