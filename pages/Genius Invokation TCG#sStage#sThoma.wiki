:{{DIcon}} Let me adjust my deck first...
:;(Open Genius Invokation TCG deck interface)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...

;(When the player defeats one of Thoma's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card thoma ingame easy 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Huh. How did that happen...

;(When the player defeats two of Thoma's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card thoma ingame easy 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Oh boy, this is getting out of hand...

;(When Thoma defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card thoma ingame easy 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hehe, small victories.

;(When Thoma uses an Elemental Burst)
:{{A|vo card thoma ingame easy 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' This seems to be my best option.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card thoma invite easy 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' ...Wow, what a crushing defeat... Guess I need to sharpen my skills a little.

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card thoma invite easy 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I gotta say, I was pretty satisfied with my finishing move there.

;(When the player defeats one of Thoma's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card thoma ingame hard 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' ...Hmm, things are getting messy.

;(When the player defeats two of Thoma's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card thoma ingame hard 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Oh dear, this is bad...

;(When Thoma defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card thoma ingame hard 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' And that's how you pull off a successful surprise attack.

;(When Thoma uses an Elemental Burst)
:{{A|vo card thoma ingame hard 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Can't go wrong with one of these!

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card thoma invite hard 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Well, that was a bust. Seems I still haven't grasped those moves my lord's been teaching me. I'll have to ask him for a refresher...
