{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Eymen:''' Hello, welcome to Djafar Tavern. Come in.
:{{DIcon}} About Djafar Tavern...
::'''Eymen:''' Djafar Tavern is always the right place for dining in Port Ormos.
::'''Eymen:''' We offer the best wine, best food, and best service, all under this roof.
::'''Eymen:''' You're family when you're here, regardless of where you're from!
:{{DIcon}} It's been a while.
:;(Unlocked after completing [[Lost in Prosperity]])
::'''Eymen:''' Hey, if it isn't my old customer!
::'''Eymen:''' The truth is I was a traveling merchant in the desert before making enough money to start this establishment.
::'''Eymen:''' Life was rough in the desert. [[The Eremites]] actually looked after me there, and that's why I helped those outlaws.
::'''Eymen:''' But now I have nothing to do with them. You'll forgive me, right?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Anything else?
:::'''Eymen:''' And... And... I just managed to collect some "fine wine" every now and then for the business of the restaurant.
:::'''Eymen:''' Would you like to take some wine? Please take some, it's my sincere apology for what I did before.
:::'''Eymen:''' No wine? Then... Oh, I have this good sword given by an Eremite member. You can take that.
:::'''Eymen:''' Port Ormos is packed with people from all walks of life, you don't want to hang around here unguarded.
::;(Obtain [[Harbinger of Dawn]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Eymen:''' Feel free to come back for some good wine anytime!
