===Description===
Located on the ground directly across from the Teleport Waypoint.
{{Dialogue Start}}
::The Tower of Ipsissimus comes from an old concept from the ancient Fontainian kingdom of [[Remuria]], and was used to describe a powerful will that could rule, sustain, and destroy the world.
::This tower was designed by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, and it represents the evolution of the human soul and the infinite mysteries of the world.
::The Narzissenkreuz Ordo believes that people continuously refine themselves through samsara cycles. These include Hyperborea, Natlantea, Remuria, and the first half of the fourth samsara (Khraun-Arya), which we are presently experiencing. Please take note that these are just names given to these eras by the Ordo based on ancient texts, and this evolution refers to spiritual evolution. There is no intent here to antagonize any research results obtained by the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]]. The human spirit undergoes the loss of paradise, the defeat of evil dragons, the original sin and baptism, and finally, freedom from the [[god]]s.
::...
::Finally, we would like to thank the following ladies and gentlemen for their generous support:
::Madam ██ ████, Mr. Eliphas ██████, Mr. ██████...
::(Most of the names have been struck out...)

::"Date: ██████"
::(...The reverse side has the seal of the courts and the signatures of [[Alain Guillotin]] and [[Neuvillette]].)
