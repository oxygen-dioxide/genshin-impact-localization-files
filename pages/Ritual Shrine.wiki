|description    = An ordinary shrine made from Otogi Wood.<br />Shrines shoulder the faith that the people of [[Inazuma]] have in the [[Raiden Shogun]]. As such, praying at these shrines is regarded by some as the most important of rituals. Thus, they will come forth while wearing and looking their best, having made most careful preparations.<br />As for the valiant and loyal servants of the [[Shogunate]], these shrines also serve as a warning that they must always bear the Almighty Shogun's ideals in mind, and be prepared to sacrifice their all for the cause.
