==Profile==
Seymour was originally created by [[Alain Guillotin]] to assist his sister [[Mary-Ann Guillotin]] with her work as a member of the [[Marechaussee Phantom]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Masterpiece's Overture}}</ref> When Mary-Ann was assigned to capture members of the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]] in [[Elynas]], Seymour accompanied her. A fierce battle broke out between the members of the Phantom and the Ordo, during which Seymour was severely damaged and incapacitated.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Final Question}}</ref>

For <math>(1/7)\times 10^{21}</math> clockwork cycles (around 493 years), Seymour's functions were in hibernation. During this time, he was discovered by [[Mamere]]. Mamere would talk about her art with Seymour, unaware that Seymour was inactive and using pre-recorded voice assets to speak to her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Illusion's Finishings}}</ref> However, after she and the Traveler rebooted Seymour using Mamere's "token" (that Melusines are born with), Seymour restarted his {{w|natural language processing}} unit.<ref name='twc'>{{Ref/Quest|There Will Come Soft Rains}}</ref>

During the events of other World Quest series, Seymour would meet the [[Oceanid]] [[Ann]] at [[The Narzissenkreuz Ordo]], where they would try to find [[Mary-Ann]]. Eventually, the Traveler would discover a member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, [[Caterpillar]], in the [[Fortress of Meropide]], who had been imprisoned there after completing a deed for the "Master". When they escaped the prison and returned to the Ordo, Seymour and Ann had just returned from a trip when he sensed Narzissenkreuz Ordo remnants (Caterpillar) and activated his "Annihilation" mode. Caterpillar gave the phrase "This is my little invention.", which Seymour recognized and downgraded his threat mode, asking Caterpillar to surrender. Caterpillar told him that he had already surrendered to the Traveler, and the group began sharing what information they had found in their travels.

Seymour is able to recognize 103,900 different styles of art, but not Mamere's. He is also able to dive underwater like the Melusines and blast through rocks with his mining module.<ref name='twc' />

Eventually, with the assistance of Ann, Caterpillar and the Traveler, Seymour eventually reunites with his master, "Mary-Ann". Ann and Mary-Ann decides to go on a trip to see the outside world, which Seymour agrees to. He also suggests bringing Mamere along, as she had taken care of him, which they also agree to. Once Mamere was brought along, they embark on their trip.

===Appearance===
Seymour takes the form of a [[Recon Log Mek]].
