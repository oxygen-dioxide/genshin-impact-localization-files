==Descriptions==
{{Description|A quiet town at the foot of [[Mont Automnequi]]. Its residents mostly work in the fishing or underwater salvage industries. Legends say that before the first diluvian period, the town was once a central hub for [[Fontaine]]'s maritime traffic network. Although the change in water levels resulted in the loss of the town's status as a major port, the cozy and warm vibe of the town doubtlessly still attracts many visitors.|[[Expedition]] description}}

==Lore==
===Siege of Poisson===
The Siege of Poisson was a disastrous moment of bloodshed at Poisson which occurred over 500 years ago, before the [[cataclysm]] occurred. Shortly before the Siege occurred, an incident known as the purge of [[Fleuve Cendre]] saw [[Eduardo Baker]], a resident and vigilante peacekeeper, arrested for resisting the purge. As he was being taken to exile in the desert, his henchmen rescued him and they rendezvoused with their nearby allies to take over Poisson, taking the [[Maison Gardiennage]] personnel escorting them as hostages and made a series of "unreasonable" demands. Those present in Poisson shortly before the Siege included Eduardo, his son [[Jakob]], [[Renault de Petrichor]], [[Rene de Petrichor]], [[Karl Ingold]], [[Parsifal the Great]] (or [[Josephine]]), [[Thompson Reed|Thompson]] and [[Leticia|Rosa Reed]], and Tom Alter.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Fleuve Cendre Ferryman}}</ref>

The Marechaussee Hunter [[Emanuel Guillotin]] was in charge of the Siege of Poisson,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Hunter's Brooch}}</ref> while [[Basil Elton]] may have been involved on some level.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Veteran's Visage}}</ref> The Siege of Poisson saw the town razed and many of its inhabitants burned to death;<ref name="Forgotten Vessel">{{Ref/Arti|Forgotten Vessel}}</ref> Renault and his wife were likely killed,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (II)|quote=Uncle Guillotin, who was with them, is part of the Maison Gardiennage. [...] he still can't be trusted. After all, Father and Mother... It was all the doing of their lackeys and goons...}}</ref> while Rene and Jakob survived and were sent to the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]].<ref name="Forgotten Vessel" /> Karl was saved by "Parsifal", but she was later arrested and died in a duel with [[Marfisa]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Rightful Reward}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Moment of Judgment}}</ref> The statuses of Eduardo and the other remaining characters have not been mentioned.

===Prophecy of Fontaine===
At the beginning of {{Quest|Deluge of Wrathful Waters}}, an earthquake occurred near Poisson, with the water levels rising at an alarming rate shortly after. The water level only rose for a short period of time, yet the consequences of this event proved devastating, as the water was actually from the [[Primordial Sea]]. Those who were at the lower street near the water didn't have a chance to escape and quickly disappeared, while those who realized what was happening scrambled to reach higher ground, forming a stampede; some were injured while others fell from significant heights.

The Spina di Rosula initiated rescue and evacuation plans during the disaster; they were assisted by the [[Fatui]] led by [[The Knave]] who happened to be in the area at the time. In the end, 12 people were recorded to have died in the event, including [[Navia]]'s bodyguards [[Melus]] and [[Silver]] who participated in the rescue operations but were not able to make it back safely; everyone else was said to be safe.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Deluge of Wrathful Waters}}</ref>

A majority of the open-world NPCs in Poisson no longer appear in the area after ''[[Deluge of Wrathful Waters]]'', but they are either staying in a shelter while Poisson is being rebuilt<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Yvette}}</ref> or dead, having not been recorded or mentioned in the list of victims.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Rege}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shimmering Memories}}</ref>

==Trivia==
