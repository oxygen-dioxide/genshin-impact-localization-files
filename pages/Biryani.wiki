|desc_basic      = Stir-fry the meat such that it is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Then stew it with condiments and long-grain rice. Sprinkle a few Padisarah petals before serving. Every grain is saturated with the aroma of fatty meat and condiments. The dish has an exquisite taste only found in Sumeru.
|desc_delicious  = The golden crown made of long-grain rice and meat is adorned with Padisarah petals, a picture that reminds you of a desert dotted with oases. The enticing scent of spices dances across each grain of rice. Every mouthful soothes your whole body. It won't take long for a customer to empty the plate. They can' help but lick their mouth, savoring the lingering scent.
