===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.
* '''Spirit Combo: Vacuum Airstrike''' is controlled by the Spirit of Omen's AI. For more information, see [[Spirit of Omen: Wind Glede#AI Logic]].

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A person hailing from the loosely-organized mercenary bands of the desert. Will work for anyone as long as the pay is good.<br />In this age where crossbows are in widespread use, only the most experienced of Eremite warriors know how to use a longbow in battle. They do not even need their eyes — merely their ears with which they sense the flow of wind and sand alike — to judge the location of their foes.<br />Ominous, fragmented spirits are sealed within the weapons they use, awakening in moments of peril. Once these weapons awaken, they can only be silenced by the cries of the vanquished — whether that be their wielders or their wielders' foes.|[[Archive]]}}
