====Paper Usage Initiative====
This interactable is located on the desk in front of the Fonta Vending Machine in the New Fontaine Research Institute.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:Dear Colleagues and Researchers, the Fontaine Research Institute is a place for research and a temple of science, and it is natural to consume paper and stationery. However, paper consumption at the Institute has been unusually high for the past three months straight. Thus, this is a stern reminder that paper is for research purposes and for theorizing on, not for wrapping snacks, propping up desks, or horseplay. If you have a need for the latter, the Logistics Office will be happy to provide the appropriate items.
:P.S.: Gambling is strictly prohibited in the Institute. Anyone using paper as gambling chips will be handed over to the Disciplinary Office for investigation.

:To the Department of Statistics and Mathematics:

:Recently, our Institute announced an initiative and implored our fellow citizens to donate books in order to rebuild the Bossuet Library (formerly known as the Alain Guillotin Memorial Library), which was unfortunately destroyed during the accident.
:Since the initiative's announcement, the response and generous donations we received from the entire community has far surpassed our expectations, providing us with large numbers of precious books, and the reconstruction plan is progressing smoothly, as expected.
:After conducting a careful study, we have decided to entrust your department (the Department of Statistics and Mathematics) with organizing the book donation information using this form to facilitate contacting and expressing our gratitude to all donors in the future.

====Concerning the Secrets Hidden Within the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering====
This interactable is located on a table near Raimondo, and is available after completing the {{Quest|Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble}}.{{verify}} It is an annotated copy of [[Chronie]]'s [["Special Report"]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...Aftering{{sic}} personally conducting a series of on-site interviews, I have uncovered the full story of the first explosion at the Fontaine Research Institute, as well as all of the facts surrounding the second explosion. It all stemmed from the Institute's attempts to conceal an immense threat so large as to threaten the safety of the entire Court of Fontaine, namely, that the ruins of the Central Laboratory remain unsafe and have not been rendered harmless, and that the location contains hazards such as out-of-control meka constructions, vast amounts of out-of-control Arkhium, and an instrument that could release high-energy pulses at any moment, among other highly hazardous elements.
:Furthermore, when the Institute employed personnel to deal with the problem, operational errors caused the Laboratory ruins to explode a second time, resulting in the accidental death of at least one researcher.
:It is understood this researcher is named [[Nacker]], and was previously a senior researcher in [[Edwin Eastinghouse]]'s Arkhium research group. He had been deliberately sidelined by the Institute after the first explosion...

:(There are two memos attached at the end.)

:"I picked this up off the ground when I was having coffee in the city, as if someone had deliberately dropped it there... Does anyone know if all this is true?"

:"The content within is categorically false, written with extreme bias and vague details to mislead readers. The Institute has submitted this to the [[Maison Gardiennage]] for investigation. You may work in peace.”
