'''Instructions''' or '''Crafting Blueprints''' are similar to [[recipe]]s, but are used for [[alchemy]]. Once used the player will learn to make the associated [[Gadgets|gadget]].

Instructions are earned through the [[reputation]] system and were introduced with it. The instructions' rarity is equal to the craftable item's rarity.
