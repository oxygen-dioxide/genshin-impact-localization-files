|description  = A gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant. It has a lovely, streamlined dorsal fin, and has the nickname "Queen of the Waters."<br />Tea-colored patterns swirl around this inquisitive fish that seems strongly interested in everything around it. Unfortunately, its method of expressing interest in anything is to have a nibble to see if it can be eaten. This isn't a malicious move by any means, but it has landed this species in hot water many times all the same.
