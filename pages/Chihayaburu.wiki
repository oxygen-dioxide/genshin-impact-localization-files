'''Chihayaburu''' is [[Kaedehara Kazuha]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*{{TalentNote|particles|3|4}}
*The skill can be used mid-air to perform a double jump or while [[gliding]], aiding in [[exploration]].
**It will also reset [[Fall Damage]] calculations.
*The Normal Attack icon will change after Kazuha is launched into the air if he can perform Midare Ranzan.<!-- show pic -->
*When Chihayaburu is cast, it will also make a slight beeping / chiming sound.
*The skill will pull all monster drops inside its range to the center, making them easier to collect.
**When used near water surface it will also pull drops which sank to the bottom of the ocean, regardless of distance between water surface and ocean floor. Pulled drops will stay floating after skill ends.

;Elemental Absorption
* With Kazuha's first passive [[Soumon Swordsmanship]], this also has the power of [[Elemental Absorption]].
* While airborne (if Kazuha has not yet Plunge Attacked or landed on the ground), a special wind will encircle Kazuha, indicating the Midare Ranzan effect, in the color of the absorbed element, if any.
* The element that will cause the absorption has its priorities: {{Pyro}} > {{Hydro}} > {{Electro}} > {{Cryo}}. If multiple elements came into contact with Chihayaburu, the element with the highest priority will be the one that is absorbed. This is also the same case for Kazuha's [[Elemental Burst]], [[Kazuha Slash]].
** For example, if Chihayaburu came into contact with multiple enemies affected by either {{Pyro}} or {{Electro}}, since Pyro has the higher priority, it will the one that causes the Elemental Absorption.
* The element that Kazuha is affected with can also be used as a source of absorption.

;Wind Tunnel
* Even though performing [[Plunging Attack]] after casting Chihayaburu can knock back enemies, the vacuum effects of Midare Ranzan can still pull and group them together.
* The Wind Tunnel created by Midare Ranzan will affect
** [[Aloy]]'s [[Chillwater Bomblet]]s
** [[Amber]]'s [[Baron Bunny]]
** [[Klee]]'s [[Jumpy Dumpty]] (both the bounce and the mines)
** [[Sayu]]'s [[Muji-Muji Daruma]]
** [[Xiangling]]'s [[Guoba Attack|Guoba]]

;Midare Ranzan
* This [[Plunging Attack]] still counts as a [[Blunt Attack|Heavy Attack]], thus making Chihayaburu an effective means of breaking [[Geo]] [[Shields]], Ores and [[Geo Constructs]].
* It will also trigger Shatter on [[Frozen]] Enemies.
* Since Midare Ranzan is an infused Plunging Attack, it cannot chop trees for [[wood]].
* Unlike normal Plunging Attacks, Midare Ranzan does not have a minimum height requirement, meaning it can be performed even if Kazuha is extremely close to the ground.

==Trivia==
*The word {{Lang|'''Chihayaburu'''|ja=千早振る}} appears in the {{Lang|Man'yoshu|ja=万葉集|ja_tl=Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves}}. Coincidentally, the word 万葉 is also Kazuha's name in Japanese,<ref group="Note">Manyou is an onyomi reading from Chinese wanye (万叶), whereas Kazuha is an alternate local reading, although the 万 is usually read as man, ban, or yorozu (kunyomi).</ref> and its meaning "Ten Thousand Leaves" is a nod to Kazuha's autumn leaf design. The Chihayaburu or Chihayafuru can also refer to a Japanese manga series or classic Japanese theatre art.
*The special plunging attack {{Lang|'''Midare Ranzan'''|ja=乱れ嵐斬}} roughly means "Wild Storm Slash," referring to how wild tempest winds can cut through the air and wreak havoc.
