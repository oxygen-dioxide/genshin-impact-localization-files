==Profile==
Shigeru is an editor at the Yae Publishing House. He manages [[Junkichi]], the author of the ''[[Onibudou]]'' novel series. Shigeru is most often at odds with Junkichi thanks to the latter's writing style, which Shigeru actively discourages him from using; these pleas often fall on deaf ears, annoying Shigeru to no end. Junkichi attempts to find some novels with the [[Traveler]] to use as "anti-benchmarks" against Shigeru's preferred writing style, complaining about Shigeru's lack of creative freedom; these novels are well-liked by Shigeru due to their consistent writing with Shigeru lecturing Junkichi on this, irking the latter further.

Thanks to Junkichi's writing style, ''Onibudou'' experiences a significant drop in popularity; fearing its cancelation, Shigeru asks the Traveler to conduct a survey with the readers of ''Onibudou'' to figure out the reason for the novel's drop in popularity. The survey is concluded to the sight of an extremely depressed Junkichi, now aware of the reason behind the novel's drop in popularity; Shigeru opines that it was probably the right time for him to get a reality check regarding his writing style.

Fed up of Junkichi's constant antics, Shigeru requests the Traveler to act as Junkichi's ninja character as another reality check; by the end of this, Junkichi realizes how confusing his story has become thanks to his writing style and endeavors to take that advice for his future stories.
