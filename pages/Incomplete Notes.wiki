The '''Incomplete Notes''' is a Quest Item used in the [[World Quest]] "[[Sinister Instruction]]." It is written by [[Washizu]] and it explains the situation of [[Higi Village]].

==Text==
...The war goes on, and the leaflets put out by both sides contain nothing but empty words. They don't give us a second thought...<br />
...Higi Village is taking on too many refugees from the mines, and we're starting to run out of food supplies. All we can do is put all our wealth together and divide it back out between everyone equally. Of course, we'd better put some cash aside to buy food for the pirates around these parts, too...<br />
...Whatever happens, the shrine near the snake skeleton needs a dedicated person to maintain it. Everyone's frightened of the [[Tatarigami]], especially since it's an invisible and untouchable threat, so I feel obliged to deal with it, as the village head...<br />
...<br />
...Many people have fallen ill, many more have developed minor ailments which nevertheless make physical labor very difficult. We can't go on like this...<br />
...[[Yasumoto]] is a fraud. All he does is boil [[Lavender Melon]] with [[Sugar]], which has no medicinal properties whatsoever...<br />
...He always seemed like a waste of space, and sure enough, he can't be trusted...
