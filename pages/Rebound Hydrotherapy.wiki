|info          = Blows a [[Bubble|Bolstering Bubblebalm]] that can stimulate blood flow and help patients drift off to sleep using a bubblegun specially made in the Fortress of Meropide.<br>Bolstering Bubblebalms will bounce between nearby opponents, dealing {{Color|Hydro DMG}} based on Sigewinne's max HP to opponents it hits. When it bounces, it will [[Healing|restore]] HP to all nearby party members except Sigewinne herself. The amount healed is based on Sigewinne's max HP.<br>After bouncing 5 times, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will disappear and restore HP to Sigewinne based on her max HP value.<br>When no opponents are present, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will bounce nearby. Only one Bolstering Bubblebalm created by a Sigewinne may exist at once.<br>When Held, the Bolstering Bubblebalm can be boosted to an even bigger size.<br><br>'''Hold'''<br>Enter Aiming Mode to begin blowing an even bigger, even more breathtaking Bolstering Bubblebalm!<br>The Bolstering Bubblebalm will grow bigger the longer the skill is Held, until it grows up to two tiers in size. Each tier it grows increases its DMG by 5% and healing by 5%. When a Bolstering Bubblebalm bounces, it will drop down a tier in size, until it returns to being a normal Bolstering Bubblebalm.<br>After weaker opponents are hit by big Bolstering Bubblebalms, they will be imprisoned and will be unable to move.<br><br>In addition, 2 [[Sourcewater Droplet]]s will be created near Sigewinne when she uses this Skill. Each Sourcewater Droplet Sigewinne collects will grant her a [[Bond of Life]] worth 10% of her Max HP.<br>When Sigewinne's Bond of Life is cleared, she regains 1 Elemental Energy for every 2,000 HP worth of the Bond of Life that was cleared. Sigewinne can regain up to 5 [[Elemental Energy]] in this way.<br><br>'''Arkhe: Ousia'''<br>Bolstering Bubblebalms periodically call down a Surging Blade on the position they hit, dealing Ousia-aligned {{Color|Hydro DMG}} based on Sigewinne's max HP.
