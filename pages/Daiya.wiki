'''Daiya''' is the collective identity of seven [[Hydro Eidolon]]s that run the [[Daiya's Three-Day Reverie]] attraction in the [[Veluriyam Mirage]].

During the original [[Zosimos]]' stay in the Veluriyam Mirage, he was curious to see if Hydro Eidolons could direct and design shows. With some effort, he managed to teach several Hydro Eidolons how to do so. As Hydro Eidolons cannot speak, they use a device created by Zosimos and [[Idyia]] with an extensive dictionary of prerecorded words and voice lines to communicate as Daiya. Daiya serves as the narrator for the three plays that make up Daiya's Three-Day Reverie.
