==Profile==
{{See Also|Dainichi Mikoshi#Lore}}
Aberaku was recognized as a sage who was enlightened by the [[Tokoyo Ookami]] during the "Year of Blindness" in Enkanomiya's history and discovered a method to bring light to the lightless nation, which led him to create the tower Helios, later known as the Dainichi Mikoshi. The second year after Helios was completed, Aberaku was imprisoned by the [[Sunchild]], the figure who had been appointed ruler over Enkanomiya. By the tenth year after Helios' completion, Aberaku was "long gone."<ref name="sun and moon"/>

After his death, his memories were preserved in the ley lines, leading him to manifest as a [[Shade of Tokoyo]].

===Appearance===
Like most [[Shades of Tokoyo|shades]], he is a translucent humanoid figure without defining physical features.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Abrax is likely derived from {{w|Abraxas}}, a term and figure among the {{w|Basilideans}}, a {{w|Gnosticism|Gnostic}} sect. Abraxas' actual role and the meaning of his name are unclear, as most sources about Abraxas' role are not derived from Basilides' teachings; however, it is generally believed that Abraxas is the "great archon" and the ruler of the 365 heavens.
