{{Description|A slime that has undergone ecological changes due to abundant Dendro in its environment.<br />There are some who see it as something similar to the Whopperflowers, hiding its true form to trick and hunt its prey, and some regard it as a slime that has been parasitized by some special plant. From this point of view, might some cultures also see these slimes as having some special medicinal value?|[[Archive]]}}

{{Enemy Stats|dendro_res=Immune|hp_ratio=2|atk_ratio=1.4|hp_type=1}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
===Flower Intact===
When the large red flower on top of the Large Dendro Slime is intact, it will be inflicted with the {{Dendro}} status at all times. {{Pyro}} can be applied to the slime to cause [[Burning]]. While burning, the slime will stay still and shake to put out the fire, and will be unable to attack.

*'''Ambush:''' Upon targeting the player, the Large Dendro Slime will burrow into the ground, only leaving its large red flower visible. If [[Burning]] is inflicted upon it, it will be forced out of the burrowed state.
**'''Ambush Leap:''' While in its burrowed state, after the player turns away from it, jumps out of the ground and high into the air before slamming down at the player's location, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}.
*'''Dendro Slime Summon:''' Spreads 3 seeds that grow into [[Dendro Slime]]s. These summoned slimes do not yield any drops and will disappear after the parent slime is killed. A maximum of 6 summoned Dendro Slimes can exist at a time.
*'''Poison Field:''' Creates a field around itself which deals '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DoT}} to players within it and continuously heals enemies within it (excluding itself).
*'''Toxic Seeds:''' Shoots 3 seeds which pop into lingering toxic clouds, applying a poison status to any player that passes through them, inflicting the {{Color|Dendro}} status and dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DoT}}.
**If the seeds come in contact with {{Pyro}}, they will explode, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}} and causing heavy knockback.

===Flower Destroyed===
If the Large Dendro Slime burns for a long period of time, its flower will be destroyed, and it will no longer be inflicted with the {{Dendro}} status.

*'''Bump:''' Bumps into the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
*'''Leap:''' Jumps high into the air before slamming down at the player's location, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}.
** Certain enhanced Large Dendro Slimes, found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges, have reduced [[Cooldown]] on this attack.

==Strategy==
{{Pyro}} is recommended against the Large Dendro Slime, as it can force the slime out of its burrowed state, as well as prevent the slime from attacking while dealing damage over time.

==Trivia==
*The Large Dendro Slime is currently the only enemy capable of dealing {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.
*The reason why the '''Toxic Seeds''' explode upon contact with {{Pyro}}, is likely because seeds contain trapped gases (the carbon dioxide and oxygen and nutrients packed into the seed), which will be released upon burning, causing a small explosion.
