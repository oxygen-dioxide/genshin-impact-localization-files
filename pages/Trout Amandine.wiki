|description     = 
|desc_suspicious = A large hunk of fish fried in oil. The bitterness of the burnt black fish skin branded into your tongue can't be washed away, not even with a giant mouthful of soup... It would seem that some practice controlling the heat is in order.
|desc_basic      = Fish fillets of a satisfying size, fried with butter before serving with a side of crispy fried almonds. According to the traditional recipe for this dish, a whole readied trout would be placed into the frying pan, but a new, fillet-featuring recipe for this dish has been gaining popularity recently as well.
|desc_delicious  = A scrumptious piece of artfully fried fish. Sweet and crisp almonds paired with perfectly fatty fish make you feel like you are floating blissfully along the ocean currents, buffeted by waves of gastronomic delight.
