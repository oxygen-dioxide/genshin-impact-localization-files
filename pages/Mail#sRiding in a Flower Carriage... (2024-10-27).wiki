Lately, Sumeru has been even lovelier than usual, with everyone decorating the streets as if wrapping a special gift. I wanted to stroll around before the Flower Carriage Parade and chat with everyone. If I could use my knowledge to clear up some of their questions, it would be even more satisfying than tasting delicious [[Candied Ajilenakh Nut]]s, hehe.

However, I've also noticed that everyone seems to be hiding something from me. Don't worry, I won't peek. I want to savor this sweet anticipation that makes my heart flutter like a Finch hopping around in my chest before opening a gift.

The [[Sabzeruz Festival]] is a day of celebration for everyone, and I hope everyone will find joy beyond their dreams today. Of course, that includes you, too. When I open my eyes in the morning, may I invite you to explore the festivities with me?
