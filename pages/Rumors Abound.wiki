==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Peace talks between [[Watatsumi Island]] and the [[Tenryou Commission]] are due to commence, but a rumor that the Tenryou Commission remains in cahoots with the [[Fatui]] is still circulating around the island. To uncover the truth, Kokomi decides to assault the Fatui's temporary encampment...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Go to the temporary Fatui camp)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' This must be the Fatui camp that the merchant was talking about.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' From the looks of it, it used to be a hilichurl camp. Who knows why the Fatui occupied it.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... looks pretty heavily guarded, how are we supposed to get in?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Not by brute force, that's for sure. But that's not a problem. The terrain here gives us an advantage, and we haven't given away our position so far.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Our enemy is in the light, while we are in the shadows. Strategically, we have the upper hand.
:{{DIcon}} And what does the grand strategist have in mind?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hmm... I think we have three options available.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Option 1: Take the king and it's checkmate. The Fatui's presence in Inazuma is weak at present. Nothing more than a few scattered remnants.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' If we strike from above and take down their leader first, the rest of them will be hard-pressed to put up a serious fight.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Option 2: Hit them where it hurts. Over there, (Traveler), for example &mdash; a store of gunpowder kegs.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' If we managed to discreetly set the gunpowder alight without alerting them, it would deal them a devastating blow.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' They'd be caught completely off guard. Both their morale and fighting capacity would be severely impaired.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Option 3: Use the environment against them. We're close to the sea here, so the air is very humid. I can gather the water vapor, you add a touch of lightning, and together we can shock them into submission.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's our grand strategist! It's a lot to think about though... which option should we choose?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' That will depend on our assessment of our own abilities.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 13.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' A surprise attack from the air is the quickest solution, but requires superior combat skills.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 14.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' With an explosion, we could rapidly reduce their numbers without a protracted battle. But absolute stealth would be required during the operation, or we'd risk exposing ourselves.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 15.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' If we decide to take advantage of the environment, we should be prepared for a lengthy siege. So, (Traveler), which is your preferred option?
:{{DIcon}} Surprise air raid.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Haha... There's the Swordfish captain I know. Every confidence in your abilities.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It's decided then &mdash; let's fight this one together. I'm no warrior myself, but I can still provide some support. I certainly won't be dropping you into battle all by yourself.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16a 2.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' We should take them down as quickly as possible and retrieve the merchant's goods.
:{{DIcon}} Gunpowder plot.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Haha, it seems that you share my strategic sensibilities.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' This is my preferred tactic. It places us in the least amount of danger.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16b 2.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Let's work together to give them the surprise of their lives.
:{{DIcon}} Let's spark things up a little.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Alright. We'll draw them out first to minimize damage to the camp itself.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I haven't had much chance to fight alongside you in the past, I'm not sure I'll be able to keep up with your pace...
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 2.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Still, not to worry. Even if I can't claim to be a warrior myself, I'm no stranger to the battlefield. This fight should be well within my capabilities.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 16c 3.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Okay. Let's clear out the camp and find out what they've been up to.
----
;(If '''Surprise air raid''' was selected and the Fatui Pyro Agent was killed first)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 17.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The king is overthrown, only the pawns remain!

;(If '''Gunpowder plot''' was selected and the [[Exploding Barrel]]s were detonated before alerting or killing any enemies)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 18.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The explosion was roughly the size I expected. Hopefully, we've given them a fright.

;(If '''Let's spark things up a little''' was selected and enemies were inflicted with [[Electro-Charged]])
:{{A|vo xhlq002 1 kokomi 19.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Their movements have become rigid and sluggish. We make a good team!

;(In the middle of the fight)
:'''Agent:''' Ugh! You haven't seen the last of us!
----
;(After the battle - good performance)
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Excellent work, (Traveler).
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hee-hee, all thanks to your genius tactics!
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Actually, even the best tactics live or die on the strength of those executing them.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Winning a battle takes a concerted effort from everyone involved. Victory never belongs to a single person.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, Paimon did make a pretty big contribution, huh...
::{{DIcon}} I beg to differ.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey!
;(After the battle - poor performance)
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hmm... That wasn't quite what I'd call "by the book"...
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' But it happens. Battles are complex things and the situation evolves constantly. It doesn't always help to stick too rigidly to a predetermined plan.
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Seems like as soon as the fighting started, the plan went out the window and we kinda winged it...
::{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' And yet, the outcome is quite satisfactory. A testament to your ability and willingness to adapt.
:<!--{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 04.ogg}}-->{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I must admit, I wasn't expecting to find the Fatui laying low in a hilichurl camp. Presumably they've been operating out of here in secret for quite some time.
:<!--{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 05.ogg}}-->{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' What's their objective? Are the soldiers right? Could they really be in collusion with the Tenryou Commission?
:<!--{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 06.ogg}}-->{{A|vo xhlq002 2 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Let's scour the camp for evidence. If the merchant's story is true, the inventory should be here.
:<!--{{A|vo xhlq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}}-->{{A|vo xhlq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Time to take a look around.
----
;(After investigating the first spot)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So these are Fatui food supplies?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They look a little past their best... Is this really all they had to eat?

;(After investigating the second spot)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, (Traveler), look here. Could these belong to the merchant?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a lot of stuff, some of it has the [[Tenryou Commission]] emblem. Yep, this has gotta be it.

;(After investigating the third spot)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this place is chock-full of bomb-making materials!
:{{A|vo xhlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is way too dangerous. We should tell Kokomi right away, and figure out the best way to deal with it.
----
;(Report back to Kokomi)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi~!
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi, we found the merchant's stuff. Look!
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Mm... I see.
:{{DIcon}} Something wrong?
:{{DIcon}} What are you thinking?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, nothing. I just zoned out for a moment.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Let's see here... Yes, these are the stolen goods alright.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Food, medicine, farming tools... All essential for post-war recovery. He was probably stockpiling them until he could make a handsome profit.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' By contrast, it's doubtful that the Tenryou Commission has any need of these items, so the idea that he was supplying them doesn't make a lot of sense.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' In all likelihood, he's just an opportunistic merchant. Nothing quite as scandalous as [[Matsuda]] and [[Uchimura]] had imagined.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... he's hardly a saint, though, right? How could he stockpile things that people are desperate for?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're not gonna just give them back to him and let him go, are we? It doesn't feel right...
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't worry, I had already foreseen this.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' In my recently issued Post-War Temporary Decree, I included restrictions on the prices of essential everyday goods. These items will ultimately reach the people at a reasonable price.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' If he had taken the time to read the decree, it's unlikely he ever would have ended up in this predicament.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi, you think of everything!
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I wish that were true. Take this alleged collusion between the Tenryou Commission and the Fatui, for example. I'm still completely stumped.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The low energy doesn't exactly help...
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Huh? What do you mean by that?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Nothing. Come on, let's take the goods back.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 13.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It's not long now until the Victory Feast. It'll be a race against the clock to get all of this resolved before it starts.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it! First we mend the peace, then we attend the feast!
----
;(Give the cargo back to the merchants)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 naruse 01.ogg}} '''[[Naruse]]:''' My goods! You got 'em back!
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 naruse 02.ogg}} '''Naruse:''' Thank you, Your Excellency! And thank you, Captain!
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 naruse 03.ogg}} '''Naruse:''' You see? I told you I was innocent!
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 matsuda 01.ogg}} '''Matsuda:''' Hmph... I'm not so sure. You could have easily planned the whole thing with the Fatui in advance...
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 14.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Based on the information we gathered from the Fatui camp, there's nothing to suggest he had any correspondence with them.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 15.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Had it been the case, then knowing how the Fatui operates, they would have left some evidence of it.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 01.ogg}} '''Uchimura:''' But... what if&mdash;
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 16.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' No ifs, no buts. We've recovered the goods. As agreed this is sufficient to establish his innocence.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 matsuda 02.ogg}} '''Matsuda:''' Apologies.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 02.ogg}} '''Uchimura:''' Guess we got carried away.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 naruse 04.ogg}} '''Naruse:''' Hah! What did I tell you? You army numskulls don't have a clue &mdash; all brawn and no brains! Coming to me with your crazy conspiracies... Lay off me next time, got it?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 17.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Sir, I'm afraid you're getting ahead of yourself. You may be innocent of the accusations originally leveled at you, but hoarding essential goods is a crime under the Temporary Decree. You must bear the consequences.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 18.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' You have already admitted to being the owner of these goods, so we are obliged to respond with appropriate measures. In addition to enforcing the sale of these goods at the accepted rates, there will also be a fine, the amount of which&mdash;
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 naruse 05.ogg}} '''Naruse:''' Wait, wait, wait! Your Excellency... Whose side are you on here?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 19.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I have no business taking sides. As the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, I abide by the principle of clear and consistent rewards and punishments.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 20.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Just as merit must be recognized, mistakes must be penalized. You may have been proven innocent of the more serious allegations leveled at you, but this does not exempt you from bearing the consequences of your mistakes.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 naruse 06.ogg}} '''Naruse:''' Wait a minute! I... But...
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 matsuda 03.ogg}} '''Matsuda:''' Well, don't just stand there &mdash; take him away! Time to pay up!
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 03.ogg}} '''Uchimura:''' Your Excellency, he says all the goods belong to him, but it doesn't add up.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 04.ogg}} '''Uchimura:''' Those with a Tenryou Commission emblem are probably his, but not the rest. Especially these ones &mdash; they're clearly for shrine use.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 21.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Mm... It seems the Fatui simply dumped all their stolen goods in one place. Leave the shrine paraphernalia to me. As for the rest, I'll leave you to sift through and try to track down the owners.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 22.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I know that's a lot to ask.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 05.ogg}} '''Uchimura:''' Not at all, Your Excellency, we're on it.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 06.ogg}} '''Uchimura:''' But if I may, Your Excellency... Maybe there were no signs of collusion in this case, but our people know what they saw. Something is going on between the Tenryou Commission and the Fatui.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 uchimura 07.ogg}} '''Uchimura:''' I know the peace talks are coming up, so... please keep an open mind.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 23.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I understand your concern. I'll be sure to give it further consideration.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 24.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' (Traveler), I'm going to take these items back to the Sangonomiya Shrine. Why don't you come along for the walk?
----
{{Quest Description|update|While on your walk around Watatsumi Island, many residents come to chat with Kokomi. You sense there's something... odd about her response.}}
;(Take a walk with Kokomi)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 25.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Watatsumi Island observes different customs than the rest of Inazuma. I imagine it must all seem a little alien to you?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 26.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It's been a long time since I last came to this village. There's been a lot to deal with recently...
:{{A|vo xhlq002 4 kokomi 27.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Next time you visit, I'll take you to the visit Watatsumi Island's old shrine.

;(Talk to Kokomi)
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' You know, the earliest shrine on Watatsumi Island was not located in Sangonomiya.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It was close to the [[Statue of The Seven]]. Back then, the people of this island recognized the [[Shogun]]'s existence, despite not venerating her as the [[Inazuma Shogunate|Shogunate]] do.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' But after she struck down our [[Orobashi|protector deity]], the shrine was abandoned.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Relations between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate have soured ever since. Mistrust has become deep-rooted over time.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I've been hoping to raise all this at the peace talks and discuss it properly. Grievances have to be let go eventually...

:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 youkou 01.ogg}} '''[[Youkou]]:''' Your Excellency, what brings you out this way on your busy schedule?
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 youkou 02.ogg}} '''Youkou:''' Oh my, you're looking a little worse for wear... You need to take better care of yourself, okay? All of our fates depend on you...
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Mm, thanks for your concern, but I'm fine.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 yuna 01.ogg}} '''[[Yuna]]:''' Your Excellency, I beg you, heed a word of advice. After all this time fighting the Shogun's Army, peace is not something that can simply be declared.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 yuna 02.ogg}} '''Yuna:''' If we reconcile with them, the god who once protected us will have died in vain...
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 youkou 03.ogg}} '''Youkou:''' Come on, that's ancient history. Besides, the fighting is barely over. We should be grateful to be at peace once more.
:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 yuna 03.ogg}} '''Yuna:''' I know, I know, it's just... *sigh* We should remain strong in these negotiations. We mustn't be too ready to compromise.

:{{A|vo xhlq002 5 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Though for the longer ones, I'd prefer it if you could write a report and submit it to the shrine. Then I can respond to each one as and when I have the time.
