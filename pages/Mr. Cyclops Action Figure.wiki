'''Mr. Cyclops Action Figure''' is a toy that [[Childe]] gives to his youngest brother [[Teucer]] during his visit to [[Liyue]] while visiting the [[The Wonderful World Of Mr. Cyclops]].

Childe commissioned a blacksmith to make it for Teucer and hoped to give the figure to him when he returned to [[Snezhnaya]]. However, after Teucer unwittingly retraced his steps to Liyue, Childe decided to instead send it to him under the pretense of a souvenir from the [[The Wonderful World Of Mr. Cyclops|Institute for Toy Research]].
