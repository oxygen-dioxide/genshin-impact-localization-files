:'''Kabewa:''' Hmph, looks like I've got a knack for wrestling! Come on, one more round!
:{{DIcon}} You're...
::'''Kabewa:''' Oh, hello! I'm Kabewa, a wres... No, I should say priest, from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]].
::'''Kabewa:''' Ahem... I'm here to research volcanic history. But, research can get a little dull at times, so I signed up for this class to let my hair down and keep fit!
::'''Kabewa:''' Never mind how poring over woven scrolls doesn't hold a candle to the thrill of throwing another per... No, err... I mean, inspiration must be honed, and so too must the body. Only through elevating both can one be complete.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Umm, then what about your research into volcanic history?
:::'''Kabewa:''' U&mdash;Uh, well, I've... certainly been looking into it! For example, there seems to be some sort of connection between volcanoes and wrestling moves...
:::'''Kabewa:''' "Up to the present day, history has been shaped by the struggles of all living beings. Wrestling, then, is no less than the very rhythm of history." So say the scrolls left behind by the priest-king [[Maghan]]...
:::'''Kabewa:''' ...Ah no, sorry, there's... no actual evidence he ever said that. I think Grand Master [[Sanhaj]] might have just made that one up...
:::'''Kabewa:''' In any case, "contention" is undeniably a key part of Natlan's history, so studying wrestling is definitely... meaningful!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Contention|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} I shan't disturb you any longer.
::'''Kabewa:''' Alright, take care of yourself! I'll continue with my wres... Ahem, sorry, no &mdash; May the Night-Wind protect you on your path, outlander.
