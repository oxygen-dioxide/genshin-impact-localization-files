'''Boyang''' is a historical character who appears in the [[Archon Quest]] ''[[At Tunnel's End, Light]]''. He was one of [[Yelan]]'s ancestors who fought at [[The Chasm]] during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, never to return.

==Profile==
Boyang is an ancestor of [[Yelan]], and the brother of [[Rongzhao]]. He fought along [[Bosacius]] and [[Millelith]] against the monsters from [[Khaenri'ah]] 500 years ago at [[The Chasm]]. They contrived a stratagem to trap and seal the beasts in the depths of The Chasm by using the [[Fantastic Compass]], a catalyst which had the power to manipulate space. In the critical moments of the fight, Bosacius and Boyang ultimately sacrificed themselves by sealing themselves along with the beasts because the compass needed constant energy flow from a mortal and an adeptus to operate.
