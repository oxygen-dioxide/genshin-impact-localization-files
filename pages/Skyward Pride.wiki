==Description==
This is a tale of sky-shaking valor.<br />
Even the [[Durin|vile dragon]] brought into the world by a [[Gold|sinner]] of that [[Khaenri'ah|ancient abyssal nation]].<br />
Lost dark, metallic wings to Anemo's pride and joy.

Long ago, the shadow dragon Durin terrorized Mondstadt, driven by jealousy for the city's glory.<br />
Awoken from his sylvan slumber by the cries of Durin's victims,<br />
The [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]] came forth and summoned his faithful servant to his side.<br />
For life and for freedom, the Archon and the [[Dvalin|Wind Dragon]] rode the wind to face their foe.

In a battle that ripped clouds from the skies, Dvalin spread his six blessed wings wide,<br />
Severing the sky and tearing through Durin's iron scales with the force of a colossal blade.<br />
As the conflict plunged the world into darkness, the Wind Dragon struck out with his claws, like swords forged of wind.<br />
They pierced deep into Durin's dark, corrupt flesh.

The battle shook the heavens, even the sun quaked with fear.<br />
Finally, Dvalin tore out Durin's throat with his teeth, and the evil dragon fell from the sky.<br />
With his god's blessing, the Wind Dragon seized victory and saved the people of Mondstadt.<br />
Yet Dvalin became poisoned by tainted blood he had consumed, and corruption seeped into his bones.

Though a hero, Dvalin was forced to suffer in solitude, while the stench of corruption drew creatures of evil to his side.<br />
Deceived by the [[Abyss]], the Wind Dragon fell to evil, and Stormterror was born.<br />
At last, his master returned to calm his frenzied mind and ease his pain.<br />
His faithful friend and a new companion fought bravely to drive out the monsters and restore Dvalin's honor.

In the century while Dvalin slept, his image faded from Mondstadt's memory,<br />
But in the tumultuous times of the recent past, the people bore witness to his six-winged figure once more.<br />
Now, blessed by the Anemo Archon, serenaded by the songs of Barbatos,<br />
Riding on the boundless winds, Dvalin takes to the skies once more.
