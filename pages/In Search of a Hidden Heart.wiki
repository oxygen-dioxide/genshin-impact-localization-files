{{Quest Description|The guide who has possessed the Secret Source Servant seems intent on guiding visitors to the "Heart of the Sacred Mountain"... However, getting there appears to require a permit, along with the activation of the Secret Source Dragon Idol guarding the entrance. Perhaps the Secret Source Servant can shed more light on the situation...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the [[Secret Source Servant (NPC)|Secret Source Servant]])
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! A Secret Source Servant... Huh. Is it just Paimon, or is this one bigger than the others?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' ?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, fancy meeting you again so soon!
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' ...Apologies, but there are no entries regarding you logged in my database.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Humans this far down... This has not happened in at least 500 years.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, you're not [[Amaru]]... or [[Ehecatl]], are you?
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' ...There were indeed individuals referred to as such, but I am neither of them.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' I believe there must be some misunderstanding.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' I am a prototype created to assist Lord [[Xiuhcoatl]] with information recording, so I have no name.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roar...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Wait... No... Not that I have no name, I...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' I am the only intelligent Secret Source Servant without a master. Even after Lord Xiuhcoatl fell, I was still in charge of the most basic...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' The most basic city maintenance and information recording functions.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' However, some records have been lost due to the invasion of our shadowy foe, so I do not have data regarding my name.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, seems like we've got the wrong guy... Err, dragon-robot?
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' It is fine.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm. This robot is huge, but it doesn't seem too bright.
:'''Paimon:''' This probably isn't that guy who uses machines to talk to us, {{Traveler}}...
:'''Paimon:''' But it did say that it is in charge of record-keeping and stuff, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't we ask it what it knows, then? Or... You know, about how we can reach the Heart of the Sacred Mountain!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe that's what "that guy" intended...
:{{DIcon}} Well, let's fire away, then...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Talk to the Secret Source Servant)
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Do you have any queries?
:{{DIcon}} How do we enter the Heart of the Sacred Mountain?
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' The entrance to the Heart of the Sacred Mountain is at the newly-excavated entrance... descend into the deepest fissure of the volcano, where it is defended by a Secret Source Dragon Idol.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Moreover, any who wish to gain access to the Heart must also obtain a "permit"...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Only then can you gain the acknowledgement of the Secret Source Dragon Idol that stands guard... Heart of the Sacred Mountain, also known as Huitzilopochtli...
:{{DIcon}} Where can we get this permit...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' According to the agreement and the edict issued by Lord Xiuhcoatl, entry to... The Heart of the Sacred Mountain, also known as "Huitzilopochtli"... the descendants of...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Proceed unto the [[Chamber of Deliberation]] to submit an application, and then wait for the permit to be issued.
:{{DIcon}} What about the energy source required by Secret Source Dragon Idols?
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Now, searching... No corresponding data entry categories... Or perhaps the relevant data, like so much else, has become lost due to the [[Abyss]]al corruption of the city...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' If you can eliminate the Abyss's influence and retrieve the data, perhaps you might find the entries you seek.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' I have marked out a potential data storage location for you. Please eliminate the Abyssal corruption present there to restore the area.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Do you have any queries?
:{{DIcon}} I have no more questions...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Understood.
;(Obtain quests [[Once, the Sacred Seat of Judgment]] and [[Where Once There Was a Calculation Array]])

:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon doesn't quite understand why, but if we want to go to the Heart of the Sacred Mountain, then we need to get a permit and clear out the Abyss...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roawr...
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! Let's get going!

;(Talk to the Secret Source Servant again, optional)
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Do you have any other inquiries? Or do you wish to mark out the next location where retrievable data might be stored?
:{{DIcon}} How do we enter the Heart of the Sacred Mountain?<!-- slightly diff response than before -->
::'''Secret Source Servant:''' The entrance to the Heart of the Sacred Mountain is at the newly-excavated entrance... descend into the deepest fissure of the volcano, where it is defended by a Secret Source Dragon Idol.

::'''Secret Source Servant:''' Proceed unto the Chamber of Deliberation to submit an application, and then wait for the permit to be issued.
::'''Secret Source Servant:''' If you wish to go there, I shall mark its location for you.
:{{DIcon}} Let's access the data we've recovered...
::'''Secret Source Servant:''' Apologies, but I do not have any restored data at present...
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} I don't have further questions...
::'''Secret Source Servant:''' Understood.

;(Talk to the Secret Source Servant after completing [[Where Once There Was a Calculation Array]])<!-- technically after obtaining 1 Phlogiston Unit -->
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Greetings. New data recovery category detected.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' ...Entries concerning Source Mechanism energy cores have been updated.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' [[Phlogiston]] is the main form of energy that powers Source Mechanisms, albeit in a condensed form that closely resembles light.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Stable amounts of [[Phlogiston Unit]]s may be generated via the controlled reaction known as [DATA LOST] allowing for more precise control over energy release.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' The energy that a Source Mechanism requires is dependent on both size and the complexity of its operating logic. The quantity of Phlogiston Units a Secret Source Servant requires is [DATA LOST]...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' While the larger Secret Source Dragon Idols, in fact, require less &mdash; specifically, three in number.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' "Information is energy, and energy is information." The data carrier you retrieved counts as a single Phlogiston Unit...
:{{DIcon}} So one "Phlogiston Unit" is one fireball...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Yes, that is one way to look at it. You restored a Phlogiston Unit that had been corrupted by the Abyss. Only then could I extract anything from it...
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' They can also be used as substitute energy sources for Abyss-corroded Source Mechanisms.
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Do you have any other inquiries? Or do you wish to mark out the next location where retrievable data might be stored?
:'''Secret Source Servant:''' Do you have any other inquiries? Or do you wish to mark out the next location where retrievable data might be stored?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Please mark the next Abyssal corrosion site...
::'''Secret Source Servant:''' Affirmative. It has been marked... Please clear the Abyss-corrupted zone as soon as possible to retrieve the data stored there.
::'''Secret Source Servant:''' From there, the database may be restored, preserved, and maintained, such that the required content may be accessed.
