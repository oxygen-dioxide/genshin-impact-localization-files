[[File:Fraktur.jpg|thumb|Fraktur font found on medieval German buildings.]]
<section begin="Description" />The '''Teyvat Script''' (''unofficial name'') (also implied to be the '''common script'''<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Phaethons' Syrtos}}</ref>) is the writing system that appears in the open world in [[Teyvat]], especially in [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]], as well as in [[Tutorial]] images. It is likely to be the universal script across Teyvat.<section end="Description" />

The letters appear to be a mirrored and broken up version of {{w|Fraktur}}, a font that was typical for medieval Germany and that was still in use up until the early 20th century. As such, many of the letters are seemingly upside-down, mirrored Latin letters. This script is generally used to write English words and sentences, but unlike English, there appears to be no distinct letter case or punctuation. Spaces are optional, as is a character that is identical to the letter "A," but written lower and closer to the previous character, that is inserted when a sentence continues to the next line.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Letter to the Treasure Hoarders}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Letter from the Abyss Order}}</ref>

Long texts in this script include [[Letter from the Abyss Order|the Abyss Order's "ransom note"]] in the quest {{Quest|Darknight Hero's Crisis}} and [[Letter to the Treasure Hoarders]] during {{Quest|Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns}}. In addition, the Liyue trailer [https://youtu.be/5DuZblVxG3I "Of the Land Amidst Monoliths"] shows Klee opening a book titled ''Teyvat'' to pages that contain the following text (spacing, capitalization, and punctuation added for legibility):
