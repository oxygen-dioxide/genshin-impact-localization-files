==Trivia==
* Benoit's cat, also named [[Nana (Cat)|Nana]], inherited its name from the dog.<ref name="Firing" />

===Etymology===
* Nana is the name of the dog from the story, ''{{w|Peter_and_Wendy|Peter Pan}}'', who acts as a caretaker for the Darling children. The {{Quest|Free Verse}} like ''Peter Pan'' revolves around the theme of children growing up and completing the quest rewards the {{Achievement|I Do Believe in Fairies}}, another ''Peter Pan'' reference.
