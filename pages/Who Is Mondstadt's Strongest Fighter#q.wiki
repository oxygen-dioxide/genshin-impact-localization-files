;(Talk to Patton about recent conversation topics)
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 patton 01.ogg}} '''Patton:''' *sigh* Shame I only get to listen in from the other side of the window and don't get to join in the debate. I'd love to give my two cents...
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Say what? What's up, what's up? Paimon wants in!
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 patton 02.ogg}} '''Patton:''' Recently, all the customers at the tavern have been debating the exact same topic: "Who is the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?"
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The strongest fighter?
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Must be someone who can floor a whole gang of hilichurls with just one punch!
:{{DIcon}} There must be far more to it than that.
::{{A|vo kllq001 3 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... then it really must be tough to become the strongest of all.
:{{DIcon}} Pff! I do that for fun.
::{{A|vo kllq001 3 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then Paimon nominates you!
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But anyway... Is there, like, a general agreement in the city on who it is, or...?
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 patton 03.ogg}} '''Patton:''' Hah. Expecting people to come to a swift and straightforward consensus in the City of Freedom is like expecting Fisherman's Toast to drop out of the sky.
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 patton 04.ogg}} '''Patton:''' Everyone's got their own opinion, backed up by a unique set of cherry-picked information... But let's be honest, that's what makes the discussion so impassioned and entertaining.
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 patton 05.ogg}} '''Patton:''' Mainstream opinion is polarized, with most people supporting one of two candidates.
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 patton 06.ogg}} '''Patton:''' One is the Dandelion Knight, the other is the Darknight Hero.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, who are you voting for?
:{{DIcon}} Anyone vote for me?
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon votes for you!
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But let's go into the {{Color|buzzword|tavern}} and talk to the patrons. Maybe we'll pick up some juicy gossip.
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 patton 07.ogg}} '''Patton:''' Oh, I do envy your life of leisure...
:{{A|vo kllq001 3 patton 08.ogg}} '''Patton:''' But don't mind me, of course. *sigh* I guess I'll just... get back to work.

----

;(Talk to Jack)
:{{A|vo kllq001 5 jack 01.ogg}} '''Jack:''' Hey, I'm doing some adventurer's training... alcohol tolerance training, to be precise... Wanna join me?
:{{DIcon}} Who's the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo kllq001 5 jack 02.ogg}} '''Jack:''' You want to know who I think the toughest fighter is?
:{{A|vo kllq001 5 jack 03.ogg}} '''Jack:''' In my opinion, that would be the finest adventurer of them all &mdash; [[Stanley]].
:{{A|vo kllq001 5 jack 04.ogg}} '''Jack:''' Guild Master [[Cyrus]] is up there with the toughest, too, but only Stanley can take on the bloodthirsty beasts of the Mare Jivari!
:{{A|vo kllq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bloodthirsty beasts of the Mare Jivari? Sounds terrifying!
:{{A|vo kllq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' D'you reckon you'd be scared if you were faced with one of those?
:{{DIcon}} I'd beat it to a pulp.
::{{A|vo kllq001 5 paimon 03a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Bam, wham, pow!
:{{DIcon}} I'd run for my life.
::{{A|vo kllq001 5 paimon 03b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sensible choice. Safety first and all that.

;(Talk to Bruce)
:{{A|vo kllq001 6 bruce 01.ogg}} '''Bruce:''' Hi! Are you here to try Mondstadt's famous wine too?
:{{DIcon}} Who's the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo kllq001 6 bruce 02.ogg}} '''Bruce:''' Er... *hic* The strongest fighter of them all?
:{{A|vo kllq001 6 bruce 03.ogg}} '''Bruce:''' That would be [[Jean]], obviously! *hic*
:{{A|vo kllq001 6 bruce 04.ogg}} '''Bruce:''' Why? Grand Master Jean is so strong... she can take out a [[Ruin Guard]] with just a few slashes of her sword. *hic*
:{{A|vo kllq001 6 bruce 05.ogg}} '''Bruce:''' And she could wipe out the three [[Hilichurls|hilichurl]] tribes at Dadaupa Gorge all by her... *hic* self.
:{{A|vo kllq001 6 bruce 06.ogg}} '''Bruce:''' Otherwise, we wouldn't have such a carefree existence... with nothing to do...
:{{A|vo kllq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's true that Jean makes people feel they're in safe hands.
:{{A|vo kllq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Meanwhile, this guy is drunk as a skunk!

;(Talk to Charles)
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 charles 01.ogg}} '''Charles:''' What'll it be today?
:{{DIcon}} Who's the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 charles 02.ogg}} '''Charles:''' The strongest fighter? I don't pay much attention to that sort of thing...
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Paimon thought bartenders had some kind of special information sources.
:{{DIcon}} Just like they have an exclusive supplier of wine?
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! That's what Paimon was getting at.
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 charles 03.ogg}} '''Charles:''' I have no involvement in any intelligence-gathering operation.
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 charles 04.ogg}} '''Charles:''' But if you made me pick someone, it would be the [[Diluc|Darknight Hero]].
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 charles 05.ogg}} '''Charles:''' I've heard some stories about him. Apparently, he once rescued a city dweller from the Abyss Order.
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There it is &mdash; the barman's top-secret intelligence!
:{{A|vo kllq001 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of the Abyss Order, their minions are really stirring up trouble all over the place, aren't they?

;(Talk to Six-Fingered José)
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 01.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' Hey, (amigo/amiga)!
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 02.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' Do you want to hear my latest composition? I put my whole heart into it, and also my soul. How about it, (amigo/amiga)?
:{{DIcon}} Who's the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 03.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' Eh? The most macho in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 04.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' ...She's a little girlie who wears red.
:{{DIcon}} A girl dressed in red?
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 05.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' That's right! I found this out one day about half a month ago, when I went to the Stormbearer Mountains looking for inspiration for my new song.
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 06.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' Guess what happened?
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened?
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 07.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' I witnessed the most powerful destructive force I have ever seen in my life!
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 08.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' I'm telling you, it completely changed the whole landscape in that part of the mountains!
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Holey moly!
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 09.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' I was hiding behind a bush and I saw this little girlie in red clothing running into the distance, leaving a trail of destruction in her wake.
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 10.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' *sigh* But I don't know if anyone will believe me.
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Now that you mention it, the idea of a tiny little girl wielding that much destructive power is a little far-fetched...
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 11.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' You want to know what I think? I think she has a treasure nobody else knows about.
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 12.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' Maybe even the most powerful treasure in all of Mondstadt!
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you say treasure!?
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler), did Paimon imagine that or did you hear it too?
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 13.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' It's... just a guess. I mean... No, it's a bard's razor-sharp intuition!
:{{DIcon}} I don't buy it.
::{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 14a.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' How can you say such a thing...
:{{DIcon}} I'll take you at your word, for now.
::{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 14b.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' Thank you, (amigo/amiga)! Ah, I am so happy to meet a true (amigo/amiga). Who would have thought&mdash;
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, this girl. What's her name?
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 15.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' Ah... I do not know her name. I do not see her often in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 sixfingeredjose 16.ogg}} '''Six-Fingered José:''' Hey, I am telling the truth! You gotta believe me!
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmmm... Doesn't sound like much to go on...
:{{A|vo kllq001 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But thanks for your intel!

----

;(Discuss your findings with Paimon)
:{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Patton was right about one thing.
:{{DIcon}} Everyone has an opinion.
:{{DIcon}} Not just that, but some people's choice of candidate was just plain weird.
:{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If everyone's got their own opinion and can't be persuaded...
:{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...How are we ever gonna find out who Mondstadt's strongest fighter is?
:{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Eureka! Paimon's got it!
:{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go see what {{Color|buzzword|Jean}} says.
:{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bet the Knights have got an official ranking table for this kind of thing!
:{{DIcon}} What makes you so sure?
::{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 07a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, let's just go and ask already. We'll never find out if we don't!
:{{DIcon}} Ooh! Do you think I'll be on there?
::{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 07b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess it depends if they counted all your shenanigans or not.
:{{A|vo kllq001 10 paimon 07b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry though, Paimon has full confidence in your abilities!

----

;(Ask Jean about the strongest fighter in Mondstadt)
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Master Jean! Sorry to bother you, we're collecting intel on the strongest fighter in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you have... uh, one of those... official Knights of Favonius&mdash;verified ranking table... thingies?
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I am sorry, but I cannot help. I do not have any relevant documentation on that topic...
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Well, that sucks.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 paimon 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo kllq001 12 paimon 04b.ogg}}  '''Paimon:''' Paimon was hoping (Traveler) would at least make the top five.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Hehe. Well, although I do not have the data to make such an assessment, I will say that my faith in our Honorary Knight's abilities has never wavered.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Which reminds me...
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Recently, one of the Abyss Order's Mages has been active near the city, although he is keeping a low profile.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' If you are staying around Mondstadt, please be on the lookout for danger.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Given your... well, high-ranking fighting strength, I trust you will be able to help keep the area safe.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 paimon 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo kllq001 12 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Awesome! After (Traveler) defeats the Abyss Order, (he'll/she'll) climb up that ranking table faster than (he/she) climbs up all those cliffs!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon. There is no ranking table.
:{{DIcon}} D'you think I'll get to first place?
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, either way, smashing the Abyss Order to bits is the right thing to do.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Hehe. I like your enthusiasm. It is infectious.
:{{A|vo kllq001 12 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' But be careful out there.

;(Talk to Jean)
:{{A|vo dialog kllq001 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' We must investigate further to find out why the Abyss Order has been so active lately.
:{{A|vo dialog kllq001 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' (Traveler), please be on your guard.

;''(When you exit the Knights of Favonius office, you bump into a very cheeky young lady. Concerned for her wellbeing, you help her up and ask if she is hurt...)''

;''(Ask about the girl)''
:{{A|vo kllq001 14 cs paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you alright?
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 01.ogg}} '''???:''' I&mdash;I'm fine! I'm not hurt! Sorry for bumping into you.
:{{DIcon}} You dropped something.
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look, there's some writing on here...
[[File:The Mystery of the Girl in Red%27s Treasure Paper.png|300px|thumb|Parchment dropped by Klee. The text reads: explosion inside city wall, grounded be thy woe/Explosions can hurt people, Jean can be dreadful/Mondstadt be bombed, Klee be doomed.]]
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Explosion inside city wall, grounded be thy woe," "Explosions can hurt people, Jean can be dreadful," "Mondstadt be bombed, Klee be doomed..."
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Yikes...
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Mr. [[Kaeya]] wrote these down for me, um... they're, um... survival rules.
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Survival rules?
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 04.ogg}} '''???:''' Y&mdash;Yeah... Rules that I must absolutely never break under any circumstances.
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Otherwise, something terrible would happen.
:{{DIcon}} Kaeya writes like this?
:{{DIcon}} Something terrible?
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Yep!
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 07.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah, I forgot to introduce myself!

:{{DIcon}} Hello, Klee.
:{{DIcon}} My name is (Traveler).
::{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And Paimon's name is... well, Paimon.
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I've heard all about you guys! You're the Honorary Knight who helps Mondstadt!
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow!
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' More recognition, yay! Paimon is so happy right now.
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 10.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I heard it from [[Amber]]... But wait, no&mdash; there's no time for this right now.
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 11.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I'm dealing with a big emergency. I grabbed my map and ran as fast as I could all the way here.
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 12.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Th&mdash;The treasure I buried in the {{Color|buzzword|Whispering Woods}}, it's... gone.
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you say... buried treasure!?
:{{DIcon}} I think she needs our help.
::{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 08a.ogg}} '''Paimon''': Exactly what Paimon was thinking!
:{{DIcon}} A girl dressed in red, hmm...
::{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 08b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And she has treasure!
::{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 08b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Seriously? Klee gets [[Six-Fingered José]]'s vote for strongest fighter in Mondstadt? What is wrong with people...)

:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 13.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yay! Thanks, you guys!
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 14.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Here! Here's where the map says the treasure should be. I put a circle round it.
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 klee 15.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I also put a wooden sign in the ground at the place where I buried it. To make it easier to find!
:{{A|vo kllq001 15 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (...Paimon is starting to understand how this treasure went missing so easily.)
