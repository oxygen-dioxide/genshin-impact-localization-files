'''Haravatat''' is one of the [[Sumeru Akademiya#The Six Darshans|Six Darshans]], the six main schools of [[Sumeru Akademiya]].

Its specialty is studying semiotics and it includes disciplines such as linguistics and ancient runes studies.<ref name="I, Researcher">{{Ref/NPC|Hosseini|s=3}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sitt}}</ref>

Their recognized color is black and its sage is [[Khajeh]]. The mascot on their symbol resembles a bull.

Haravatat is currently the Darshan with the lowest enrollment numbers.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Faruzan|Something to Share: Haravatat}}</ref>

==Overview==
{{Quote|For example, my Darshan, Haravatat, focuses on linguistics, but we seldom discuss literature. Instead, we spend a lot of time studying syntax and structure.|[[Gregor]], daytime dialogue}}

Amongst the Six Darshans, Haravatat's focus on semiotics involves it in the study of ancient languages. Due to this overlap in studies with [[Vahumana]], which focuses on history, its members occasionally argue on the best way to approach the study of history. Based on [[Khaldun]] and [[Yavanani]]'s debates, those from Vahumana view Haravatat's approach as "tunnel-visioning," while Haravatat believes that Vahumana's approach of trying to find universal rules that determine all events in history "[puts] the cart before the horse."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Khaldun}}</ref> Members of the [[Rtawahist]] Darshan, such as [[Hawa]], also sometimes dabble into the study of ancient runes, although Hawa comes from a lineage of scholars and may have gained some knowledge from outside her Darshan.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Hawa}}</ref>

One of the languages studied in Haravatat is the ancient King Deshret script.<ref name="SSD">{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>

According to [[Alhaitham]], a member of Haravatat, every student is required to study at least twenty languages before graduation.<ref name="SSD" /> However, he does not specify whether this is a requirement for all students in the Akademiya, or only those of his Darshan. Futhermore, it might have been a sarcastic remark on his part.
