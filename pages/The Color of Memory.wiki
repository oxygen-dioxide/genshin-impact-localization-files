;(Enter Citlali's home)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Now, when it comes to weaving the scroll itself, you don't actually need to lift a finger. But, if we're going to pass on Huitzilin's technique, your participation is critical.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you saying, Citlali?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Follow me.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, look at this place... Do you weave scrolls, too?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Scrolls...
:{{Color|menu|Gazing upon the as-yet incomplete woven scroll, Citlali recalls Huitzilin as she was in the past...}}
;(Flashback begins)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Scrolls? I thought you were going to show me your masterpiece?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 01.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' That I am, old friend. The technique I'm about to show you directly relates to woven scrolls.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' *sigh* Fine, what is it? Something that can turn the tide of war or prevent a great disaster?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You probably want to challenge me, right? I know you don't have the strength for a real fight, so I'll let you beat me with words.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 02.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' *cough*... Old friend, my life is nearing its end. I'm afraid... I don't have time for another match.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hey...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 03.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' Don't worry. I trust in the belief of our tribe... that death is not the end, but the beginning of a new existence in the Night Kingdom, where everything is made of memories.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 04.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' So, do you know why our ancestors insisted on using colorful woven scrolls to record our history?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 05.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' Because... history is the memory of a people.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 06.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' We give our scrolls an orange hue so the dead can still feel the warmth of the setting sun.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 07.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' We decorate them with kernels of Grainfruit so the dead can still enjoy the abundance of our harvests.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I know that... But, something this important? Why entrust it to me and not one of your students?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 08.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' Hehe, as your friend, I admit... I'm being a bit selfish.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 09.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' *cough* I don't have long, Citlali. I'm not sure... I can truly explain my decision. But, I know you will understand one day.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 huizilin 10.ogg}} '''Huitzilin:''' For now... will you accept my final request?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...Just this once.
;(Flashback end)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I understand now, Huitzilin &mdash; just like you said I would... Claw, help me move this outside. I'm going to color it.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 claw 01.ogg}} '''Tlapo:''' !
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 29 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, come with me.
:{{Black Screen|Claw helps you bring the woven scroll outside.}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 together 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' We are like birds, soaring through the horizons of time...

::'''Citlali & Huitzilin:''' I linger between brushes of memory
::'''Citlali & Huitzilin:''' Seeking the "color" of my final journey
::'''Huitzilin:''' When I get there
::'''Huitzilin:''' May there be feathers to paint the sky shades of rose
::'''Huitzilin:''' And fields of green to beckon adventurous souls
::'''Huitzilin:''' And azure oceans with which to sail into the unknown
::'''Huitzilin:''' And volcanos, too
::'''Huitzilin:''' Where, despite the danger
::'''Huitzilin:''' Hidden treasure waits to be found
::'''Huitzilin:''' And graffiti art, of course
::'''Huitzilin:''' Without that color
::'''Huitzilin:''' Just imagine the dullness of night...
::'''Citlali:''' Anything else?
::'''Huitzilin:''' In the end
::'''Huitzilin:''' I hope everyone remembers my color, too
::'''Citlali:''' In the end
::'''Citlali:''' I hope everyone remembers your color, too
::'''Citlali:''' All in all, it was just a technique for coloring a scroll
::'''Huitzilin:''' The task I'm entrusting to you...
::'''Huitzilin:''' Is much more than that
::'''Huitzilin:''' Farewell, my friend
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' Preserving these colors in memory...

:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I knew you would understand.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This... This is the special scroll! How did you know how to weave it, Citlali?
:{{DIcon}} Remember the "gift from the spirits"?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, you've lived for more than two hundred years, you know how to weave the special scroll &mdash; that must mean... You're the one behind the "gifts from the spirits"!
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Well, it's not like I wanted to interact with the appointed, so whenever I delivered the scroll, I used illusions to confuse them.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The fact that it turned into some kind of "divine intervention" is because no one was skilled enough to see through my tricks...
:{{DIcon}} Why not just tell them?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've carried the duty alone for all these years? Even if you don't like interacting with people, why not teach someone else how to do it?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...{{Traveler}}, you can see the special color, right?
:{{DIcon}} Yes.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The essence of that color is memory. That means completing the special scroll is a process of searching for color within your memories.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Passing the technique on to someone means sharing your memories with them. You need to leave traces of your color in their memory, and they must do the same.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Even though I only confirmed that today, I've had suspicions for a long time.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' And, well... ever since Huitzilin died, I haven't wanted to form that kind of connection with people.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It was her final wish, so I kind of resigned myself to taking on the burden forever. After all, I have all the time in the world.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 claw 01.ogg}} '''Tlapo:''' !
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But, Claw never stopped appointing new candidates to weave the scroll &mdash; despite knowing exactly how I felt about the situation.
:{{DIcon}} You mean, he never stopped trying to find new friends for you?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...I knew exactly what he was doing. And, yeah, if I ever did share my memories with someone, I guess that person would be a friend. But, it never got to that point.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 13.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' This time, though, you win, Claw.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 claw 02.ogg}} '''Tlapo:''' ...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Take this. I guess... it's my response to what you told me the other night.
:[[File:The Color of Memory Handkerchief.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 15.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' If I had to choose my color, it would be the color of this handkerchief.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 16.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Countless people exist in my memories, and I know one day, that will be my fate, too &mdash; a memory living on in someone else's head.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 17.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Since you have a long lifespan, you're the perfect candidate to bear this memory... and carry my color in your mind.
:{{DIcon}} Does this mean I'm officially your friend?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 18.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...Just keep it safe, and you better not forget my color when I'm gone.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, it's a little early to talk about death, don't you think? It's only been a few seconds since we made the friendship official...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 19.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Isn't that what friends are for?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, this is a serious commitment... Well, Citlali, if {{Traveler}}'s going to leave their color in your mind, too, it'll probably be gold, right?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 20.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Actually, their mark is already there. Remember the mind-reading effect I couldn't fix? Well, I finally got to the bottom of it.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 21.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Sharing senses allows communication to occur between the consciousness of different people. Naturally, memories are also involved in that process.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 22.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Although I didn't know it at the time, we both have the ability to see the "color of memory," which means that when I shared my senses with you, a connection was created between our memories.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 23.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' And that connection is what caused my original spell to go haywire...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... you can hear {{Traveler}}'s thoughts because you left traces of color in each other's memories?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And that's why {{Traveler}} could hear your thoughts, too! Because it works both ways, right?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 24.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Quick thinking, but only those trained in the mystic arts can maintain that level of connection.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 25.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' That's why I can still hear {{Traveler}}'s thoughts, but not the other way around.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 26.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' There's no need to worry, though. Now that I've figured out how it works, I'll get rid of it in no time.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 27.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (I lied &mdash; hearing each other's thoughts actually depends on the strength of the connection between our memories.)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 28.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (So, after everything we just went through, I bet you can hear me again.)
:{{DIcon}} (!)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 29.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (I knew it...)
:{{DIcon}} (So, is there a way to stop it?)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 30.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (Since the connection between our memories is already there, the only way to get rid of the effect is for one of us to forget about the other.)
:{{DIcon}} (...)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 31.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (Heh, just messing with you... I'm a legendary shaman of my tribe, now that I know the cause, of course I can figure out how to fix it.)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 32.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (It'll probably still take some time, though. So, bear with me for now.)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 33.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (Besides, I'm an open book. It's not like you're gonna hear anything embarrassing... Oh, um, unless I've had a few drinks.)
:{{DIcon}} (Oh, so you can turn it off? That's a shame...)
::{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 34a 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (A shame? I mean, if you ever miss this whole telepathy mess, I could always share my senses with you again.)
::{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 34a 2.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (No promises, though. Some thoughts are better kept to yourself.)
:{{DIcon}} (Oh, so you can turn it off? That's good to hear.)
::{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 citlali 34b 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' (Yeah, I get what you mean. Some thoughts are better kept to yourself.)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 31 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Huh...?

;(Talk to Biram)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Ah, you did it? Your investigation into the Battle of Seven Colors must have been fruitful indeed. I do hope you share what you learned.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 caholom 01.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Wow, the scroll is finished already!
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 aywastin 01.ogg}} '''Aywastin:''' Elder Tlapo's wisdom is never wrong!
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we should explain... Take it away, {{Traveler}}!
:{{Black Screen|You share everything you learned about the special color while keeping Citlali's contribution a secret.}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 02.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I see...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You don't look surprised at all...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 03.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It makes perfect sense! History is the memory of a people. If we want to depict it, a dye derived from people's memories is, of course, the best choice.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 04.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Now, it's just a matter of preserving this secret technique...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 05.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Hmm... From your description, it sounds like learning the technique requires the previous holder to share their memories?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, yeah...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 06.ogg}} '''Biram:''' In that case, I must work with our priests to re-invent the technique based on the principles you described.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 07.ogg}} '''Biram:''' After all, memories are precious things &mdash; meant to be shared with those closest to us. I cannot take that choice away from you, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 08.ogg}} '''Biram:''' You completed your task admirably. Finding a way to carry on that legacy is now our duty.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! We'll leave that to you!
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 09.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Oh, and please pass along my thanks to Granny Itztli.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 10.ogg}} '''Biram:''' We interrogated the Fontainian merchant she apprehended, and it turns out, he is the reason some among our tribe started to question our history.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 11.ogg}} '''Biram:''' He hired people to spread misinformation about the Battle of Seven Colors. The recent friction within the tribe is entirely his doing.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 12.ogg}} '''Biram:''' We now have a record of his crimes and will begin working with Fontaine authorities in a few days.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, he was behind the controversy in the first place! Guess it's easier to investigate when people are already questioning something...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, that clears it up! People don't just question their history out of nowhere.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Biram. We'll be on our way.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 32 biram 13.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Until we meet again.

;(Talk to the priests, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq006 caholom 01.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Ah, Natlan's victory against the Abyss! Very fitting for a scroll like this...
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq006 aywastin 01.ogg}} '''Aywastin:''' I wonder how long until Elder Tlapo chooses the next appointed?
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq006 besuci 01.ogg}} '''Besuci:''' Speaking of Elder Tlapo, I heard he went missing yesterday! Do you know what happened?
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq006 chogan 01.ogg}} '''Chogan:''' Elder Tlapo works in mysterious ways. The meaning of his departure will become clear in time, but for now, we cannot hope to fathom it.

;(Talk to Citlali)
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You told him everything, right?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! We left out the part about your contribution, but it kinda seemed like Chief Biram saw through us...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You could have just said it was a "gift from the spirits"...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, but Chief Biram deserved something in return for his hard work.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...I guess he is different from the previous chiefs. But, if he figures out it was me all these years, I'm in for a world of trouble.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 allier 01.ogg}} '''Allier:''' There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you!
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it's the other Fontainian researcher... He wasn't taken away with his boss?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 allier 02.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Please, call me Allier... After questioning, the tribe absolved me of any serious wrongdoing, so here I am.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 allier 03.ogg}} '''Allier:''' I'll be heading back to Fontaine soon &mdash; no employer means no funding, after all. But, I wanted to finish my investigation first.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 allier 04.ogg}} '''Allier:''' I'd like to ask some questions about Huitzilin. I want people outside of Natlan to hear her story, but my understanding still has some holes.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Questions? Hmph... Why should I let an outlander tell our stories?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 allier 05.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Don't misunderstand &mdash; I have no intention of twisting your history or using it to make a profit. It's just honest curiosity, I assure you.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 allier 06.ogg}} '''Allier:''' I believe amazing stories deserve to be shared with the world. Culture thrives through dialogue and exchange.
:{{DIcon}} He has a point.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Alright, you can ask your questions, but be quick. I have important plans after this.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Important plans?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 allier 07.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Thank you very much!
:{{Black Screen|Allier conducts a thorough interview, only leaving when Citlali finally runs out of patience.}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Another day, another drained social battery...
:{{DIcon}} We should probably get going, then.
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Mhm... Ah, hold on &mdash; you owe me a pair of books!
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that... When it comes to light novels, your memory is like a steel trap, huh...
:{{DIcon}} Books that rare will take some time to find...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You're telling me... Yeah, it's not gonna be easy &mdash; you might need to go to Yae Publishing House in person...
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But, I don't need them right away. Just don't forget, okay?
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course! We'll get them sent to you as soon as we can!
:{{A|vo xtlllq006 33 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Sent to me...? Nuh-uh, I don't want a stranger knocking on my door when I'm hungover. Here, just take this.

;(Talk to Kuroda)
:'''Kuroda:''' Greetings! Welcome to Yae Publishing House.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Someone sent me to find a couple of books...
:{{Black Screen|You describe the books that Citlali wants to Kuroda.}}
:'''Kuroda:''' The first edition of "[[Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power]]" and the limited deluxe edition of "[[Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?]]"...
:'''Kuroda:''' I must say, your friend clearly knows a thing or two. In terms of collection value, nothing the Yae Publishing House is currently putting out can rival the books you're after.
:'''Kuroda:''' To think I'm not acquainted with such a discerning reader... Truly regrettable.
:{{DIcon}} Are they still available?
:'''Kuroda:''' You won't find either of them on the open market, and certainly not in storage. Every copy was snapped up long ago.
:'''Kuroda:''' However, I do happen to have a copy of each...
:{{DIcon}} I can pay you for them.
:'''Kuroda:''' No, no. These books would be far better off in your friend's possession, someone who can appreciate their true worth.
:'''Kuroda:''' Knowing that, I'd be more than happy to give them to you.

:'''Paimon:''' Was she drinking again last night? Paimon thinks we should leave the books on the table. She wouldn't want us to wake her.

;(Interact with the desk)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Can I just put them here?)
:'''Paimon:''' We should probably write a message. Citlali might not even notice them in all this mess.
:{{Black Screen|Paimon finds a piece of paper and thinks for a moment before writing a note.}}

;(Read Paimon's note)
:'''Check Note:''' (Citlali, we found the books you were looking for. You were sleeping when we got here and we didn't want to wake you.)
:'''Check Note:''' (Maybe drink a little less next time, eh?)

;(Interact with the desk after a daily reset)
:'''Observe:''' (This light novel is sitting quietly on the table in pristine condition. Its new owner clearly hasn't been able to bring herself to read it, choosing to simply admire it instead. The area has been intentionally wiped clean, with not even so much as a speck of dust around it.)

;(Interact with the shelves after another daily reset)
:'''Examine Bookshelf:''' (Two light novels have been placed carefully on the bookshelf. There's very little dust on the shelf, as though it has been tidied especially for them.)
