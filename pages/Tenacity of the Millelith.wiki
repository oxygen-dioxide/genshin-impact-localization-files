'''Tenacity of the Millelith''' is an [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities which can be obtained from [[Ridge Watch]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*4-Piece Bonus:
**The Elemental Skill damage needs to come from the character with the artifact set equipped.
**For characters whose Elemental Skill deploy something on the field which deals ticks of damage even if they have been switched off, such as [[Zhongli]]'s [[Dominus Lapidis]] or [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s [[Kurage's Oath]], the 4-Piece Bonus will activate and refresh itself every time the tick of damage is dealt.
**The Elemental Skill needs to hit the enemy, but it does not have to deal damage. Hitting enemies who are immune to your character's element or enemies with elemental or wooden shields will still trigger the bonus.
***However damage as a result of elemental reactions from the elements applied to self from the skill do not trigger the bonus. Thus the initial {{Color|Hydro DMG}} from Barbara's [[Let the Show Begin♪]] works, but subsequent [[Electro-Charged]] damage from the skill's Hydro coming into contact to [[Electro]] enemies does not.
**The 4-Piece Bonus does not stack with itself.
***Having more than one character in your team equip 4-Piece Tenacity of the Millelith does not stack the ATK and Shield Strength gained from the bonus. It only refreshes the duration.
***However, it can stack with the 4-Piece Bonus of [[Noblesse Oblige]].
**[[Attribute#ShieldStrength|Shield Strength]] refers to a character's personal attribute. To grant the buff, the character with the artifact set equipped does not necessarily need to provide shields to give increased Shield Strength.
