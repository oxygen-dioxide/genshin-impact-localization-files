==Gameplay Notes==
*4-Piece Bonus:
**The Elemental Skill hit needs to come from the character with the artifact set equipped.
**The Elemental Skill only needs to hit the enemy, but does not need to deal damage. Hitting enemies who are immune to your character's element or enemies enemies protected by [[Shield]]s will still trigger the bonus.
**The 4-Piece Bonus will not stack if multiple characters in the team equip 4-Piece Tenacity of the Millelith but it will reset the buff's duration.
***However, it can stack with the 4-Piece Bonus of [[Noblesse Oblige]].
**[[Attribute#ShieldStrength|Shield Strength]] refers to a character's personal attribute. To grant the buff, the character with the artifact set equipped does not need to provide shields to give increased Shield Strength.
