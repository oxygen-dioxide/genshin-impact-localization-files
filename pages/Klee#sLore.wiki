==Personality==
{{Quote|An explosives expert and a regular at the Knights of Favonius's confinement room. Also known as Fleeing Sunlight.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Klee is an energetic and outgoing girl who takes after her mother, Alice. She has a particular talent for creating explosives and is not fazed by the sound of explosions. She adores anything that can blow up like her bombs, such as [[Amber]]'s [[Baron Bunny]]. She acts like a typical energetic young child who loves playing with her friends. Unfortunately, her definition of playing usually involves explosives; she is particularly fond of "fish blasting", tossing bombs into lakes full of fish.

In part due to her young age, Klee can be very naïve at times and easily confused by topics she doesn't have any context for, such as mistaking Mondstadt's wine industry for a monster,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Klee|About Diona}}</ref> and wondering why [[Diluc]] is always grumpy, even going as far as to call him the "weird grown-up". Klee is not fond of seeing people argue, as she believes that they only come when someone was in the wrong and that it doesn't feel right to her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Zip Along (According to Safe Cart Operating Procedures)}}</ref>

While she's considered an official member of the Knights of Favonius, Klee's antics often get her into trouble. Like any child, she often tries to flee to avoid being reprimanded, but is eventually caught by [[Jean]] who sends her to solitary confinement to self-reflect. While she occasionally does try to do so, she almost always quickly forgets and instead uses the time to brainstorm new bombs and explosives.

Klee loves her fellow knights, and is well-loved by them in turn. She is particularly fond of [[Kaeya]] and [[Albedo]]. Whenever she heads out of the city to play, she always follows the "survival rules" which Kaeya gave her. Albedo, on the other hand, is an older brother figure who takes care of her. She is also quite fond of Diona, even catching fish to share and offering her Dodoco to pet when Klee unintentionally upsets her. She loves her parents, though she does not see them frequently as they often travel around Teyvat and thus have little time to spend with her.

<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Klee uses the [[:Category:Short Female Characters|short female]] model. She has pale skin, light red eyes, pale blonde hair with a prominent cowlick, and elf ears.<ref group="Note">While Klee's ears can be described as "elf ears," it is unclear if Klee herself is an elf.

The Happy Little Spark... always getting locked up in solitary confinement

<nowiki>===============================</nowiki>

In the streets and back alleys of Mondstadt, it is said that there is a girl in red, who holds an unparalleled treasure within the Knights of Favonius.

No matter where or when this girl appears, it's not long before everything goes up in flames.

What's more, as the aftermath of the explosions fades away, she disappears without a trace &mdash; there are few who have ever seen her face.

Amongst the swirling rumors, there are even those that go so far to say that she is the most powerful within the Knights of Favonius.

Though as far as Acting Grand Master Jean is concerned, using this power for such destruction simply means...

Solitary confinement's gonna need some upgrades!

As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated.</p><p>As a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.</p><p>After all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives.</p>

==Trivia==
* "Klee" is German for "clover." Her constellation, Trifolium, is Latin for "clover".
** While clover typically has three leaves (the 'tri' in 'Trifolium'), all of the clover motifs seen on Klee's clothes and in her elemental effects have four leaves. {{w|Four-leaf_clover|Four-leaf clover}} is traditionally thought to bring good luck to the barer.
* She was the first new character added after the launch of the game. Overall, she was the 22nd playable character introduced to the game.
* In her voice-lines regarding other characters barring [[Diluc]], Klee considers them to be "the best" of her friends. While [[Albedo]] is not related to her by blood, she does not address him as such due to her mother asking them to treat each other as siblings.
* Her Troubles voice-line suggests that the typical explanation given to her before being put in solitary confinement is that she has been a "bad girl" and has to "reflect on her actions" during her punishment.
* While her [[Kaboom!|Normal]] attack consists of throwing bombs, Klee seems to still use her catalyst to summon them.
* Just like her mother, [[Alice]], Klee is blessed with a race of longevity. [[Alice#Trivia|Both are speculated to be elves]].
* Her backpack resembles an elementary schooler's {{w|Randoseru}}.
* Klee shares the same Chinese voice actress with [[Nahida]].
** During the Honkai Impact 3rd × Genshin Impact crossover, Theresa received Klee's clothing as an outfit.
* Klee shares the same [[birthday]] as [[Kuki Shinobu]], July 27.
* According to her [[Birthday/Klee|Birthday Mail]], Klee does not always limit her escapades to Mondstadt; one time she managed to travel all the way to the [[Minlin]] region of [[Liyue]] by herself and blew some scales off the [[Primo Geovishap]] while Master [[Jean]] was busy working.
* Klee was tapped by the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] in [[Liyue]] as a demolitions expert for their [[Chasm Exploration Team]], and was to be accompanied by [[Kaeya]] as her guardian. However, she then carelessly blew up the stove at [[Good Hunter]] and was subsequently grounded (as was Kaeya, so it's possible he had an active hand in causing the mischief).
* Klee is known by these aliases or titles:
** Spark Knight
** Red Burny Girl (by [[Razor]])
** "Red Knight of the Stormbearer Mountains"
** Wicked girl of flame (by [[Dodo-King]] during [[Midsummer Island Adventure/Story|Midsummer Island Adventure]])
** Red Velvet Mage ([[Blossoming Starlight]] description)
