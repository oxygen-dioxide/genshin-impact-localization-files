Of the regions of Teyvat, Fontaine prides itself as the hub of culture and the arts; or in the words of [[Francis]], a traveling merchant from the region, "true beauty and elegance." The newspaper [[The Steambird]] is the main newspaper of the [[Court of Fontaine]]; [[Mona]] is a columnist on it, suggesting that they have writers from all across Teyvat.

There is a special energy system in Fontaine, however, it is mentioned to be on the verge of declining, thus causing many people to find alternative sources.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Core Propulsion}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Fontaine seems to be inspired by {{w|France}}. It may specifically be based on France in the 1910s, based on the clothing of NPCs from Fontaine (e.g., [[Caspar]]).
* ''Fontaine'' means "fountain" in French, which is fitting for the region of the Hydro Archon.
* Rock 'n' roll originates from Fontaine.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xinyan|Character Details}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Chihu Rock Bulletin Board|About Xinyan}}</ref>
* [[Xingqiu]]'s novel, "The Legend of Sword," is extremely popular in Fontaine and [[Inazuma]].<ref name="Gaiman" />
* [[Yanfei]], a legal advisor from Liyue, notes that Fontaine's legal system is notoriously complicated in one of her Voice-Overs.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yanfei|About Us: Relationships}}</ref>
* The Chinese name for Fontaine, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=枫丹|zh_rm=Fēngdān}}, may be a clipping of {{Lang|Fontainebleau|zh=枫丹白露|zh_rm=Fēngdānbáilù}}, a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris.
* The [[Kamera]] comes from Fontaine, as told by [[Xu]] when giving you the [[Snapshots]] World Quest.
* Fontaine seemingly makes numerous allusions to the video game series ''Bioshock''. The character Frank Fontaine appears as the main antagonist of the first ''Bioshock'' game. The name Fontaine or Fountain could also be an allusion to Ayn Rand's novel "The Fountainhead", from which ''Bioshock'' takes inspiration. Moreover, the Steambird could be a reference to the Songbird guarding Elizabeth's tower in ''Bioshock Infinite''. The characters Lyney and Lynette may also be homage to the character Chen Lin, who appears in ''Bioshock Infinite'' as well.
** Moreover, the first ''Bioshock'' game takes place in the underwater city of Rapture, while in ''Genshin Impact'', Fontaine is the region of Hydro.
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''Masquerade of the Guilty'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Iustitia omnia vincit''," which roughly means "Justice conquers all," and is modified from the Latin phrase ''{{w|labor omnia vincit}}''.
* [[Lochfolk|Oceanids]] are all from Fontaine. It seems like they left their native region because of the ideals of the new Hydro Archon.
* In Vol. 2 of [[Heart of Clear Springs]], Fontaine is described as "Sapphire-Blue".
* [[Midori]] claims that Fontaine has a "air-rail" system that allows citizens to travel along the sky, as [[Ramsay]] wrote in his diary. Although, there is no substantial evidence of this as in the World Quest [[International Travel Log]] we find out that most of what Ramsay writes in his diary is fictional.
