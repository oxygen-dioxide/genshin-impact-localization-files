Of the regions of Teyvat, Fontaine prides itself as the hub of culture and the arts; or in the words of [[Francis]], a traveling merchant from the region, "true beauty and elegance." The newspaper [[The Steambird]] is the main newspaper of the [[Court of Fontaine]]; [[Mona]] is a columnist on it, suggesting that they have writers from all across Teyvat. According to the Steambird, Fontaine is located in the center of Teyvat<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/20735060 The Steambird Special Edition I: The Terrestrial Sea, Origin of All Waters]</ref> and is the source of all waters on the continent. Its entire continental plate is elevated, making it significantly higher than other nations. At the edge of Fontaine is a massive waterfall that stretches for thousands of meters.

Fontaine boasts its immersion in the development of technology, as referenced in multiple story points &mdash; such as the [[Mikage Furnace]], designed by Fontaine engineers, including [[Xavier]]; and limited events &mdash; such as in [[Fabulous Fungus Frenzy/Story|Fabulous Fungus Frenzy]], where the [[Wisdom Orb]] is a Fontaine-local-designed equipment designed to suppress specific behaviors in organisms.

Minor events that have featured Fontaine's technologic prowess include [[Core of the Apparatus]], which features Fontainian inventions that can manufacture toys and furnishings, and [[Evermotion Mechanical Painting]], which features mechanical gear systems.

There is a [[Arkhe|special energy system]] in Fontaine; however, it is mentioned to be on the verge of declining, causing many people to seek alternative sources.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Core Propulsion}}</ref> Additionally, [[Santon]] states that the air in Fontaine is "practically toxic fumes" and that there is much less connection to nature there, though he is not necessarily referring to the entire region.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where Are the Fierce Creatures?}}</ref>

According to [[Vasco]], a [[diving]] certificate can be obtained in Fontaine, and diving itself is an important profession in the nation.

[[Liben]] had described Fontaine's locals as believing that some type of "judgment" was "soon to come," possibly in reference to the prophecy described in the [[Chapter IV|Archon Quests]] about the nation being destroyed by rising sea levels to absolve its people of their "sin."

The [[Fontaine Research Institute]] is located in Fontaine, though its original main buildings were destroyed in an experiment conducted by [[Edwin Eastinghouse]].

Other races also reside in Fontaine, such as the [[Melusine]] and, once upon a time, the [[Oceanid]]s.

==Notable Features==
Fontaine features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards:

===Arkhe===
[[Arkhe]] is composed of two opposing energy types: {{Ousia}} and {{Pneuma}}. When they meet, an annihilation reaction will be triggered. A character that possesses an Arkhe alignment can trigger a reaction by performing a Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attack on an object with the opposite alignment.

There are various ways that a character can gain an Arkhe alignment:

* [[:Category:Playable Fontaine Characters|Fontanian characters]] all have an innate Arkhe alignment.
* [[Furina]] can switch her Arkhe alignment by performing a Charged Attack.
* The [[Traveler]] has {{Pneuma}} alignment while resonated with {{Hydro}}.
* The [[Sword of Narzissenkreuz]] grants an Arkhe alignment while it is equipped. This alignment can be switched at the "Little Fountain" in [[Annapausis]].
* Characters can receive a temporary Arkhe alignment by picking up a [[Pneumousia Block]]. This temporary alignment expires after a short time, or when an Arkhe reaction is triggered.

Arkhe reactions can cause the following effects:

* Temporarily shutting down {{Enemy|Clockwork Meka}}
* Stopping an [[Enhanced Pneumousia Amplifier]] from applying buffs to nearby enemies
* Launching [[The Miraculous Antoine Roger Aircraft]], which will typically grant a [[Remarkable Chest]] upon reaching its destination after dealing with any obstacles
* Balancing a [[Pneumousia Relay]], which can trigger various effects
* Opening a [[Pneumousia Storage Box]]

===Diving===
Unlocking the first [[Statue of the Seven]] in Fontaine grants the [[Diving]] ability. Rather than only being able to swim along the surface of the water, players can also dive and explore below the surface. This applies to all swimmable bodies of water in Fontaine except the sea around [[Petrichor]].

* While in any body of water which permits diving, the player will not consume [[Stamina]] and cannot [[Drowning|drown]]. Fast swimming consumes Aquatic Stamina instead, and when it depletes the player must slow down, similar to how [[sprinting]] works on land.
* [[Normal Attack]]s, [[Elemental Skill]]s, and [[Elemental Burst]]s are disabled while in the water. Instead, the player has a weak "water string" attack that does a small amount of damage to enemies. However, this attack can be used on [[Xenochromatic Creature]]s to acquire various abilities from them (see '''Xenochromatic Abilities''' below).
* [[Allogravity-Condensed Water Body|Allogravity-Condensed Water Bodies]] are floating cubes of water found at the site of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] explosion. The player can dive inside them just like most other bodies of water in Fontaine.
** The player receives an on-screen warning if they approach the side or bottom boundaries of the cube; continuing and crossing said boundary will cause the player to start falling.
** During the {{Quest|Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble}}, several of the cubes are contaminated by condensing components from the exploded Arkhium reactor. [["Allogravity-Condensed Water Body" affected by energy flow|These cubes]] have a purple tint and the player diving inside them will continuously accumulate Turbulent Energy Flow until the condensing component is found and removed. Accumulating too much Turbulent Energy Flow causes all characters to [[Fallen Character|drown]].
* Entering a [[Current]] will cause the player to move quickly along a pre-determined path, only able to control movement laterally within it.
* Hidden underwater locations and objects can be revealed by touching an [[Echoing Conch]] or using the Sonar Waves Xenochromatic ability.
* [[Huge Shell]]s contain objects which are revealed when struck.
* The player can recover [[HP]] by touching a [[Recovery Orb]].

===Energy Storage Devices===
[[Fixed Storage Device and Energy Transfer Device|Energy storage devices]] can be used to power machines.

* The Fixed Storage Device is locked in place, while the Energy Transfer Device can be picked up and deployed near an object to be powered.
* These devices are red when uncharged and blue/green when charged.
* Some machines require power from a charged energy storage device to function:
** Boxing Dummies ''(unofficial name)'' must be attacked to trigger an effect.
** An [[Energy Transfer Terminal]] can be used to extract energy from one device and transfer it to another. The player may need to switch to another terminal (by pointing at it with the viewfinder) to be able to see the target object. These terminals are also used to read [[Cipher Letters]] and occasionally operate other machines.
** [[Stabilizer]]s require the player to attack it while its indicator is within a blue zone three times to trigger an effect.
* [[Flying Energy Thief|Flying Energy Thieves]] are glowing balls found in the [[Geode Mine Shaft]] that disable a storage device carried by the player.

===The Symphony===
Available only in the [[Nostoi Region]], the [[Symphony]] is a game mechanic where the player can cause objects with musical note icons above them to stop or start moving.
* [[A Mysterious Bookshelf Full of Grimoires|Mysterious Bookshelves]] are doorways in the [[Faded Castle]]. To open one, the player uses the Symphony to halt a [[Mysterious Grimoire]], capture it, deliver it to the Bookshelf, then use the Symphony to move the books out of the way.
* The [[Ancient Autoharmonic Music Box]] is powered by the Symphony. The player can find scores and play them on the Music Box to unlock rewards and reveal the history of [[Remuria]].
* [[The Auric Anglerfish!|Auric Anglerfish]] are large mechanical fish, each of which holds a chest in its mouth. Using the Symphony to pause one while near its tail will cause it to stop and hold its mouth open for a brief time, allowing the player to collect the chest.
* [[Autoharmonic Reed Pipes]] are devices which can be calibrated to one of three different notes with the Symphony. They are always found in groups, and the puzzle is solved when all Reed Pipes at a location are set correctly.
* The [[Faded Castle]] contains a stage that hosts a special challenge that will test the player's skills with the Symphony.
* [[Scylla]] looks like a whale, but he is a powerful [[Vishap]] that lives in the waters of the [[Sea of Bygone Eras]]. He is initially bound by [[Dragonborn-Suppressing Shackles]], which the player must release by solving Symphony-based puzzles. Once he is free, Scylla is usually within sight of the player while swimming in the Sea, and tapping a button will cause the player to be rapidly drawn to him. While next to Scylla, the same action will allow the player to be quickly propelled in any direction away from him.
* Certain special coral formations contain [[Swaying Eels in the Coral Reefs|Swaying Eels]]; the player can interact with a formation to get the Eels to pop in and out. Use the Symphony to pause them when they are all out to solve the puzzle.
* [[Washer Octopus|Washer Octopi]] respond to the Symphony, which can be used to manipulate them in various ways. [[Resonant Anemone]]s light up when a Washer Octopus is nearby. Lighting up all the Anemones in a location simultaneously will trigger an effect.

===Xenochromatic Abilities===
Special abilities can be obtained from [[Xenochromatic Creature]]s found underwater. A button will appear which allows the player to use the ability; hold it down to aim it.

* The {{Enemy|Armored Crab}} ability grants a shield and the ability to fire damaging shockwaves. Absorbing an attack with the shield aiming will increase the shockwave damage. This is the only way to defeat [[Bullet Barnacle]]s, and is useful for blocking [[High-Pressure Water Vent]]s to position [[Fantastical Floating Ball]]s in their corresponding rings.
* The {{Enemy|Ball Octopus}} allows the player to fire an energy beam which can damage enemies and manipulate certain objects. Unlike the other abilities, it can also be obtained and used on land by interacting with certain ecological research devices. The ability is particularly useful for:
** Destroying the floating objects over [[Contaminated Bacterial Mat]]s to remove them
** Moving or merging [[Dew Bubble]]s, used to trigger [[Harmonious Reed Pipe]]s
** Spinning [[Floating Crystal Flower]]s, causing Floating Crystal Platforms to appear
** Moving [[Humongous Hat Jellyfish]], which can be used to launch the player into the air
** Manipulating [[Operable Mechanism]]s to commandeer [[Dangerous Autocannon]]s, redirect [[Energy Flow]]s, and solve other puzzles
** Launching [[Potential Energy Orb]]s into their targets when standing within a nearby golden sign
* The {{Enemy|Blubberbeast}} grants the ability to release waves of sonar that can detect significant objects as well as damage enemies.
* The {{Enemy|Hunter's Ray}} grants the ability to fire Fontemer Water Blades. As well as attacking enemies, it's also useful for cutting the glowing spots on [[Fontemer Seagrass]]. Cut all the spots within a short time to release whatever is trapped by the seagrass.
* The {{Enemy|Hat Jellyfish}} grants the ability to throw a Bing-Bang Hat Bomb and remotely detonate it. This ability is particularly useful for destroying underwater rock piles, [[Red Meanies]], and [[Strange Eel]]s. The latter two, when found in groups, must be all destroyed within moments of each other or they will respawn.

===Other===
* A [[Beastly Rift]] is a challenge where the player must defeat waves of {{Enemy|Riftwolf|text=Riftwolves}} while protecting several crystals.
* Elynas Prisms ''(unofficial name)'' can be attacked to send an energy projection in the direction of the attack. Some Prisms can be moved, and some are inactive until struck by energy from another Prism. Some Prisms are covered with stone and must be struck by energy from another prism to remove the stone and trigger an effect.
* [[Experimental Focusing Mirror]]s are encountered during the {{Quest|Treacherous Light of the Depths}}. Each one can be used to relay a beam of light to eventually activate a device in the center of the ruins where they are found.
* {{Item|Hydroculus|text=Hydroculi}} can be offered at [[Statues of the Seven]] in Fontaine for rewards.
* Collecting three [[Hydrogranum|Hydrograna]] will create a Hydro Core that continuously applies {{Hydro}} within an [[Area of Effect]] around the player for a short time. The effect can also be triggered with fewer Hydrograna by self-applying {{Hydro}}.
* [[Jadewater Fruit]] are objects that can be damaged and eventually destroyed with [[Elemental Reaction]]s, releasing whatever is inside (usually a [[Chest]], a [[Mora Chest]], or an [[Enemy]]).
* [[Looking Glass]]es can teleport the player to and from certain locations in [[??? (Fontaine)|???]]. Only the ones which glow purple are active and can teleport the player.
* [[Optical Coupler]]s are found in the [[Tower of Ipsissimus]]. During {{Quest|Savior's Wake}}, the player must rotate devices in the center of each room to align the couplers in order to proceed.
* A [[Water Volume Detection Crystal]] can be activated by continually applying {{Hydro}} to it, triggering various effects.

{{Soundtracks by Category Table|type=location}}

==Trivia==
[[File:Fontaine Latin "Motto".png|150px|thumb|Screenshot from [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]]]
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Iustitia omnia vincit''" which roughly means "Justice conquers all," and is modified from the Latin phrase ''{{w|labor omnia vincit}}''.
* [[Xingqiu]]'s novel, ''[[A Legend of Sword]]'', is extremely popular in Fontaine and [[Inazuma]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Gaiman}}</ref>
* [[Yanfei]], in one of her Voice-Overs, notes that Fontaine's legal system is notoriously complicated.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yanfei|About Us: Relationships}}</ref>
* The [[Kamera]] comes from Fontaine, as told by [[Xu]] when giving the ''[[Snapshots]]'' World Quest.
* [[Midori]] claims that Fontaine has an "air-rail" system that allows citizens to travel along the sky, as [[Ramsay]] wrote in his diary. However, there is no substantial evidence of this, and in the World Quest ''[[International Travel Log]]'', the player finds out that most of what Ramsay writes in his diary is fictional.
* Rock 'n' roll originates from Fontaine.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xinyan|Character Details}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Chihu Rock Bulletin Board|About Xinyan}}</ref>
* All [[Oceanid]]s are from Fontaine. They are loyal to the previous Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]], and allegedly left their native region because of the ideals of the new Hydro Archon, [[Focalors]].
* In Vol. 2 of ''[[Heart of Clear Springs]]'', Fontaine is described as "sapphire-blue."
* Fontaine is currently the only nation that does not have any [[One-Time Domain]]s.
* After Focalors' execution by the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] and the destruction of the Hydro Archon's divine throne, Fontaine is currently the only region without an Archon, with the duties related to the Hydro Archon being instead passed to Neuvillette, the Hydro Dragon Sovereign.
** This also makes Fontaine to be the first nation ruled by a Dragon Sovereign.

===Etymology===
* {{fr|Fontaine}} means "fountain" in French, which is fitting for the home of the Hydro Archon.
* The Chinese name for Fontaine, {{zh|s=枫丹|t=楓丹|rm=Fēngdān}}, may be a clipping of "Fontainebleau" ({{zh|s=枫丹白露|t=楓丹白露|rm=Fēngdānbáilù}}), a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris known for its castle sitting right by the water.

===Cultural References===
* Given the nation's technology, its emphasis on "true beauty and elegance," and the attire of its NPCs (e.g. [[Caspar]]), Fontaine may be partially inspired by the {{W|Belle Époque}}, a period of French history in the late 19th century characterized by technological advancement and artistic flourishing.
** Some of Fontaine's cultural elements seem to take inspiration from other cultures in and around France, such as {{W|Basques|Basque}}, {{w|Corsica}}n, {{W|Iberian Peninsula|Iberian}} , {{W|Italy#Culture|Italian}},  {{W|Greece#Culture|Greek}}, {{W|Culture of England|English}} cultures and {{W|Western Europe}} as a general.
*Visually, Fontaine is inspired by the {{W|Baroque}} and {{W|Art Deco}} styles, while its geography is in part based on that of the {{W|French Alps}}.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/2E73BKNtOXI Special Program 4.0]</ref>
* Fontaine's theme as heard in the ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'' seems to be based on "Aquarium," the seventh movement of ''{{W|The Carnival of the Animals}}'', a musical suite by the French {{W|Romanticism|Romantic}} composer {{w|Camille Saint-Saëns}}.
