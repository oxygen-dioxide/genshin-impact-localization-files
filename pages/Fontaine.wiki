Of the regions of Teyvat, Fontaine prides itself as the hub of culture and the arts; or in the words of [[Francis]], a traveling merchant from the region, "true beauty and elegance." The newspaper [[The Steambird]] is the main newspaper of the [[Court of Fontaine]]; [[Mona]] is a columnist on it, suggesting that they have writers from all across Teyvat.

Fontaine boasts its immersion in the development of technology, as referenced in multiple story points—such as the [[Mikage Furnace]], designed by Fontaine engineers, including [[Xavier]]; and limited events—such as in [[Fabulous Fungus Frenzy/Story|Fabulous Fungus Frenzy]], where the [[Wisdom Orb]] is a Fontaine-local-designed equipment designed to suppress specific behaviors in organisms.

Multiple minor events also feature Fontaine's technologic prowess including [[Core of the Apparatus]] which feature Fontaine-made inventions that can manufacture toys and furnishings, and [[Evermotion Mechanical Painting]] which feature mechanical gear systems.

There is a special energy system in Fontaine, however, it is mentioned to be on the verge of declining, thus causing many people to find alternative sources.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Core Propulsion}}</ref> According to [[Vasco]], a Diving certificate can be obtained in Fontaine, suggesting that such activity might be popular here.

[[Liben]] states that the present Fontaine is a quite dangerous and oppressive in nature. Locals have been described to be antsy, believing that some type of "judgment" is "soon to come."

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* "Fontaine" means "fountain" in French, which is fitting for the home of the Hydro Archon.
* The Chinese name for Fontaine, {{zh|s=枫丹|t=楓丹|rm=Fēngdān}}, may be a clipping of "Fontainebleau" ({{zh|s=枫丹白露|t=楓丹白露|rm=Fēngdānbáilù}}), a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris.
* In the video ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''Masquerade of the Guilty'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Iustitia omnia vincit''," which roughly means "Justice conquers all," and is modified from the Latin phrase ''{{w|labor omnia vincit}}''.

===Inspiration===
* Fontaine maybe be inspired by 1910s {{w|France}}, based on the clothing of NPCs from Fontaine (e.g., [[Caspar]]).
* Fontaine seemingly makes numerous allusions to the video game series ''Bioshock''.
** The character Frank Fontaine appears as the main antagonist of the first ''Bioshock'' game.
** The name "Fontaine" or "Fountain" could also be an allusion to Ayn Rand's novel ''The Fountainhead'', from which ''{{w|Bioshock}}'' takes inspiration.
** Moreover, the Steambird could be a reference to the Songbird guarding Elizabeth's tower in ''Bioshock Infinite''.
** The characters Lyney and Lynette may also be homage to the character Chen Lin, who appears in ''Bioshock Infinite'' as well.
** Moreover, the first ''Bioshock'' game takes place in the underwater city of Rapture, while in ''Genshin Impact'', Fontaine is the region of Hydro.

===Lore===
* [[Xingqiu]]'s novel, ''The Legend of Sword'', is extremely popular in Fontaine and [[Inazuma]].<ref name="Gaiman" />

* The [[Kamera]] comes from Fontaine, as told by [[Xu]] when giving  the ''[[Snapshots]]'' World Quest.
* [[Midori]] claims that Fontaine has an "air-rail" system that allows citizens to travel along the sky, as [[Ramsay]] wrote in his diary. Although there is no substantial evidence of this as in the World Quest ''[[International Travel Log]]'', we find out that most of what Ramsay writes in his diary is fictional.
* Rock 'n' roll originates from Fontaine.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xinyan|Character Details}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Chihu Rock Bulletin Board|About Xinyan}}</ref>
* [[Lochfolk|Oceanids]] are all from Fontaine. They allegedly left their native region because of the ideals of the new Hydro Archon.
