Today, a banquet is to be held at the Kamisato Estate to
admire the vernal scenery.

In gratitude for the assistance that you have often provided, I cordially extend this invitation in hopes that you will attend.

After enjoying the humble fare at our table, if you still wish to partake in other elegant pursuits, you may as well sit together with me under the eaves, drinking tea and sculpting flowers.

Using the elemental energy contained within crystal cores, the fleeting moment in which a flower blooms may be preserved, allowing the spring sunlight filling the garden to linger.

As for the most crucial step in fashioning flowers with your sword, I will perform a demonstration first. Practice makes perfect, but it should not prove difficult for one so accomplished in the martial arts as yourself.

I have instructed my retainers to prepare the necessary materials, and await your visit.
