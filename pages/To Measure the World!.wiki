{{Quest Description|A researcher who wants to measure the world seems to have run into a bottleneck...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Farghani, optional)
:'''Farghani:''' (Should the sky fall...)
{{Dialogue end}}
===Defeating Enemies Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farghani:''' Hey, friend, can I have a moment of your time?
:{{DIcon}} What is it?
:{{DIcon}} I'm really busy right now.
::'''Farghani:''' Oh, please don't say that. What could be more serious than the incoming collapse of one's own house?
::{{DIcon}} Your house is... collapsing?
::'''Farghani:''' Ahem... Of course not. But say you live in a house, and you've never seen it in its entirety, and no one has ever guaranteed its structural strength...
::'''Farghani:''' Wouldn't living in this house every day worry you somehow? Such is also the case with living in this world.
:'''Farghani:''' Now, have you ever thought about this: what will happen if the sky falls?
:{{DIcon}} You are worrying too much...
:{{DIcon}} Technically, it can't.
:'''Farghani:''' That may be so. But why doesn't the sky fall? Why won't the earth collapse? Without accurate measurements, we'll never have answers to these questions.
:'''Farghani:''' In fact, I've come up with a model that explains these questions perfectly. I just need more observational data to support it...
:{{DIcon}} So, do you need my help?
:{{DIcon}} Good luck. See you.
::'''Farghani:''' Wait, wait! Please reconsider. If my work is published, it could be earthshaking!
::'''Farghani:''' You will then be a collaborator in this great theoretical undertaking. I can also put your name in the acknowledgments...
::'''Farghani:''' Or... Or you could even be my co-author...
::{{DIcon}} Are things really this urgent?
::'''Farghani:''' If I can't get results, I'm afraid that I'll have a problem getting research funding... And that would be far more devastating than the sky falling.
::{{DIcon}} I wouldn't demand co-authorship.
::{{DIcon}} I prefer to be paid fairly.
:'''Farghani:''' So you are willing to help, then? Many thanks to you!
:'''Farghani:''' I've chosen a perfect spot for my observations, but some monsters are active there.
:'''Farghani:''' Please, drive them away so I can conduct my observations safely.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Farghani:''' Thanks a lot. Let's be on our way, then.
:{{DIcon}} Do you need to be at the scene yourself?
::'''Farghani:''' I need to get some data on-site to find the cause of any discrepancies in my calculations.
::'''Farghani:''' Fixating on a pile of papers will only lead you further away from the correct answer, so let's hit the road.

;(Approach the location)
:'''Farghani:''' This is the place. Traveler, please drive away the monsters!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''After ensuring that everything is safe and secure, Farghani starts to analyze the data...'''

;(Talk to Farghani)
:'''Farghani:''' Hmm... So that's it. Introduce this variable, and the discrepancies can be explained.
:'''Farghani:''' But does that change my other deductions?
:{{DIcon}} Any progress?
:'''Farghani:''' Sorry, I forgot that you were still here... Here's your payment.
:'''Farghani:''' As for my progress... I've fixed some issues, but new ones have emerged. That's research, I guess.
:'''Farghani:''' I might have to keep troubling you, Traveler, until I reach a final conclusion.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Setting Beacons Up Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farghani:''' Hey friend, can I have a moment of your time?
:{{DIcon}} What is it?
:{{DIcon}} I'm really busy right now.
::'''Farghani:''' Oh, please don't say that. What could be more serious than the incoming collapse of one's own house?
::{{DIcon}} Your house is... collapsing?
::'''Farghani:''' Ahem... Of course not. But say you live in a house, and you've never seen it in its entirety, and no one has ever guaranteed its structural strength...

::{{DIcon}} I wouldn't demand co-authorship.
::{{DIcon}} I prefer to be paid fairly.
:'''Farghani:''' So you are willing to help, then? Many thanks to you!
:'''Farghani:''' Actually, I have ordered a customized set of beacons that will automatically collect the raw data necessary to support my deductions.
:'''Farghani:''' They need to be set up on high places such as cliffs and mountaintops for the raw data to stay free of the possible effects of terrains.
:'''Farghani:''' But as you can see, I'm not much of a climber...
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
::'''Farghani:''' Thank you! The sampling sites are nearby. Just let me know when you're done.
:{{DIcon}} You didn't take terrain into account when placing your order?
::'''Farghani:''' Ahem... The sensitivity of the instrument was a priority, so the range of applications was naturally sacrificed...
::'''Farghani:''' After all, the calculations could veer far off the mark even if we make only a small mistake. Anyways, I'm counting on you.

;(Talk to Farghani again before setting the beacons up)
:'''Farghani:''' Hopefully there won't be any more data errors this time...

;(Approach the area where the beacons should be set up)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be Farghani's sampling site. Let's set the beacons up here!

;(After setting all the beacons up)
:'''Paimon:''' Alrighty, our work here is done. Let's go back to Farghani.

;(Talk to Farghani)
:'''Farghani:''' Huh? Have you finished setting up all the beacons?
:{{DIcon}} We're all set.
:'''Farghani:''' Thank you so much. Please take this as your payment.
:'''Farghani:''' Now all I have to do is wait for them to collect the data, and then I'll be able to confirm my deduction!
:'''Farghani:''' Still, how am I supposed to go up and retrieve the beacons...?
{{Dialogue end}}

===Retrieving Beacons Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farghani:''' Ah, Traveler, you've finally come!
:{{DIcon}} How's your research going?
:'''Farghani:''' Thanks to you, I've made huge progress in the past few days. The beacons should be collecting data as we speak.
:'''Farghani:''' Now I only have to retrieve the data and verify my new conjectures!
:{{DIcon}} All you have done these days is make conjectures!?
:{{DIcon}} You haven't made any progress at all...
:'''Farghani:''' Well, I've optimized some equations and calibrated my instruments. After all...
:'''Farghani:''' I won't be able to climb up to the locations where you set those beacons.
:'''Farghani:''' I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you to retrieve those beacons.
:{{DIcon}} Well, alright then...
::'''Farghani:''' Please, Traveler! I will take care of the payment, do not fret.
:{{DIcon}} Why don't you take retrieval into account next time...
::'''Farghani:''' I have weighed some options, you know. Adding a retrieval device, expanding our range of applications... things like that.
::'''Farghani:''' But they require a higher budget, and I'm not sure how this might affect the data precision.
::'''Farghani:''' Anyways, I'll be counting on you this time as well!

;(Talk to Farghani again before retrieving the beacons)
:'''Farghani:''' Hopefully there won't be any more data errors this time...

;(Go to where the beacons were set up)
:'''Paimon:''' This is the place where we set the beacons up previously... Whoa! Why are monsters here!?

;(After defeating the monsters)
:'''Paimon:''' What the... There weren't any monsters here before!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, whatever, let's just collect the data and ask Farghani what's going on.

;(Talk to Farghani)
:'''Farghani:''' What? Monsters, out there? This doesn't make sense. The environmental parameters showed that...
:'''Farghani:''' Could the beacons have become variable themselves? Perhaps their vibrations and sounds attracted the monsters...
:'''Farghani:''' Oh no, will these things affect the data? Ah, sorry. I've been talking to myself again.
:'''Farghani:''' I didn't expect to cause you extra trouble. My apologies, and please, take this as your payment.
:'''Farghani:''' I should be more conscientious with my measurements next time.
