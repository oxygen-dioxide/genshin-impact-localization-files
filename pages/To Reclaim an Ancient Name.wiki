{{Quest Description|To rescue [[Kachina]], who has been trapped in the [[Night Kingdom]], you must first seek out her [[Ancient Name]]. [[Kinich]] says that he has given the ritual implements needed to do so to the Chief of the Scions of the Canopy. Head there and ask around.}}

;(Return to the Stadium, optional)
:{{A|vo ntaq006 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this place looks so different now... What happened here?

;(While heading to the Scions of the Canopy along the wooden path north of the Statue of The Seven in Coatepec Mountain, optional)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What can you tell us about the Scions of the Canopy?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The tribespeople are very adventurous.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, kind of like us, then!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Hmm... I'm not so sure. You don't strike me as the type to enjoy danger.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The Scions of the Canopy are a bunch of thrill-seekers. They love extreme sports like rock climbing, rappelling, volcano parkour...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Or even bungee jumping without a rope while a [[Yumkasaur]] stands at the edge and uses its tongue to catch them. Sound like something you'd be interested in?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... that does sound different from our usual "adventures."
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's not doing any of that! She can just cheer you on from the sidelines!

;(Approach the marked area)
:;(If Wayna has not been spoken to yet)
::{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' That's Wayna, the tribal chief. Let's head over to him.
:;(If Wayna has been spoken to once before)
::{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Wayna's right over there. Let's go.

;(Approach Wayna)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 01.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' [[Chasca]]?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Nice to see you again, Wayna.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I'm afraid we don't have time for pleasantries, so I'll get right to it. We're here for the Spiritspeaker Stone.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 02.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Whoa, hold on a second. At least tell me why you need it, first.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' My friend, Kachina, is trapped within the [[Night Kingdom]]. We need the Stone to find her Ancient Name and rescue her.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 03.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Rescue her? From the Night Kingdom?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 04.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I'm sorry, but someone needs to tell you what you don't want to hear. Going there... A "mature warrior" would never make such a foolish decision.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 05.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' The nature of battle is unpredictable. You never know how it's going to end. Losing a friend is tragic, but when that happens, the best thing you can do is focus on how to prevent further casualties...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I appreciate what you're trying to say, Chief Wayna, but if the price of "maturity" is abandoning a friend in need, I'll choose foolishness any day. If Kachina's still holding on, then so will I.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 06.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I thought you might say that... *sigh*
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Is something wrong, Wayna? This doesn't seem like you.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' "Life isn't complete without taking risks" &mdash; that's always been your mantra.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 07.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Haha... It's nothing. The Night Kingdom is a dangerous place. Can't blame me for checking if you were up to the task.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 08.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' If you're that determined, far be it from me to stop you. Here's the stone. Keep it safe, okay? It's not like we have a spare.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Thank you.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, seems like you two go way back... But, aren't you from the Flower-Feather Clan, Chasca?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 09.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Oh, Chasca's a peacekeeper, so she's famous throughout the tribes. She's always the one people call to resolve conflicts, so we slowly got to know each other that way.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 10.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Her younger sister, [[Chuychu]]'s always hanging around our tribe, too. She's helped us out a lot in the past.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you have a younger sister!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yes... I'll introduce you to her sometime.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 13.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' But, let's get back to business. Wayna, how do we use the Stone?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 11.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' As you probably know, your intended destination is completely different from the real world. The Night Kingdom is like a river flowing with "concepts," and the Ancient Name you seek is like a tiny fish swimming downstream.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 12.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' In that sense, the Stone is like a fishing boat drifting down the river. But, the boat alone isn't enough. You need a "fisherman" experienced enough to steer it in the right direction.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We couldn't do that ourselves?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 13.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' With a little practice, I'm sure you could. You have the strength and the talent... If you want to make sure this works, though, I could recommend someone to you.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 chasca 14.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Who?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 14.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' [[Vichama]] &mdash; a legendary warrior and scout from our tribe.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 15.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' He's got a keen eye and a well-honed intuition. Even his Ancient Name means "to seek"... If you're "fishing" for a Name, you're gonna want him on the boat.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Vichama? Why does that name sound familiar...?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' He's one of Auntie [[Atea]]'s "hot spring buddies." I've heard stories about him.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Where can we find him?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 16.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Ever since [[Mallko]] passed, he spends most of his time gazing out at the scenery from the clifftops. Follow the path that way, and I'm sure you'll find him.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Thank you. We'll go look for him there.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 1 wayna 17.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' *sigh*... Good luck. I hope everything goes well.

;(Talk to Wayna again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq005 wayna 01.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Vichama spends most of his time up in the clifftops, gazing at the scenery. You should head over there and have a look.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Wayna enlightens you regarding the principles underlying the usage of the Spiritspeaker Stone. Up next, it's time to get help from Vichama, a legendary Scion scout.}}

;(Approach Vichama)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Someone admiring the scenery from the clifftops... Ah, that must be him!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello there! Are you Vichama?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 01.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' That's me. Did you need something?
:{{Black Screen|You tell him about Kachina and the Spiritspeaker Stone...}}
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 02.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' What? You're saying... you can bring someone back from the Night Kingdom? How is that even possible?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 03.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' No, if you really think about it... Anything's possible in that kind of place. But, that would mean...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A&mdash;Are you okay? You don't look so good...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 04.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 05.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Everything's fine.... I'll help you, but I do have a small request.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 06.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' After I help you find Kachina's Ancient Name, I want to use the Stone to look for my friend's as well.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your friend? Oh, Wayna mentioned someone named "Mallko." Is that who you're talking about?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 07.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Yes, but I'd rather not get into it, if it's all the same to you.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' That's not a problem. We agree to your request.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah! Since you're helping us find Kachina's Ancient Name, it's only right that we return the favor!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 08.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Then we're agreed. Can I have a look at the Stone?
:;(Vichama looks at the Stone for a while)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 09.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' ...I see. From what I can tell, it functions almost like an Abyssal Pylon &mdash; both connect the Night Kingdom to the living world.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 10.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Once the connection is established, the [[Abyss]] will come surging through the opening like a predator honing in on the scent of blood. So, we have to be sure not to use it in a tribal settlement.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, you got all that just from looking at it?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 11.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' I just picked up on the basics, really. I still have no idea why it works. You said someone named [[Citlali]] invented this? They must be a genius.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 12.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' I'll go find an open area and start setting things up. In the meantime, I need you to get two things for me.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We'll go right away! What do you need?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 13.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' First, I'll need some hook-ropes. Pretty much every store around here carries them, so no need to go anywhere special. Oh, and I need to build a "net" out of them, so make sure you get a good amount.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Wait, are you saying you're going to use a real net to "catch" Kachina's Ancient Name? How does that work when one's tangible and one's not?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 14.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' By creating something tangible in our world &mdash; like a net &mdash; we can create a connection to a corresponding "concept" in the Night Kingdom. Basically, I'm going to use the "concept of a net" to catch something equally intangible &mdash; an Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, I see. What about the second thing you needed?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 15.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Right, I need one... no, two chunks of Obsidian. Once we bring the Ancient Names into our world, we'll need a place to store them.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 16.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Normally, you can only get Obsidian from the [[Children of Echoes]], but I heard there's a traveling merchant from that tribe around here somewhere, so maybe you can try your luck there.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gotcha!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 17.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Alright, let's split up. See that clearing? Let's meet over there when you're done.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 18.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Oh, and, you can send someone with me, if you want. In case you're worried I might take the Stone for myself.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' ...What do you think, Chasca?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' There's no need. Wayna spoke highly of you. That means you're trustworthy.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 19.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' I appreciate it... even though that doesn't mean much to me anymore...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 vichama 20.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Anyway, it'll take some time to set everything up, so no need to rush. I'll see you in a bit.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What an odd guy. He seemed so defeated, but also really invested in the Stone at the same time.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I don't have any more insight than you, Paimon. Let's just focus on the preparations for now.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 2 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hang on Kachina... We're coming for you.
{{Dialogue End}}

;(Talk to Amauta)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hello. Do you have any hook-ropes for sale?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 amauta 01.ogg}} '''Amauta:''' Hook-ropes? As in rock climbing equipment?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yes. How much for your whole stock?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 amauta 02.ogg}} '''Amauta:''' The whole thing? Let me see... That would be 30,000 Mora in total. Deal?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Deal.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 amauta 03.ogg}} '''Amauta:''' Wait, really?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' What, you want me to drive down the price? We just need these as fast as possible. Thanks.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 amauta 04.ogg}} '''Amauta:''' No problem at all! I'll even pass along some information on the house. These ropes are usually used by rock climbing enthusiasts. If you want to learn, [[Roca]]'s the person you want to ask.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 3 amauta 05.ogg}} '''Amauta:''' Alright, that's everything. Here you go.

:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Excuse me, do you sell Obsidian?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 01.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Why, yes! I've got a chunk for sale right over there.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Perfect! Is that the only one, though? We actually need two.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 02.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Hmm, that might be tough. Tell you what, I'll take a look through these boxes over here, and we'll see what we can find.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Thank you so much. We'll wait here.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Phew...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Relax. Everything's going according to plan.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I know... It's just, I could tell Vichama feels the same way about his friend that I do about Kachina. I hope this chunk of Obsidian isn't the only one...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Kachina always carries all sorts of shiny stones with her. If I was the one trapped in the Night Kingdom, she'd have a whole pile of Obsidian ready in a heartbeat.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 03.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Well, would you look at that, I did bring an extra... Here you go, young lady. How does it look?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Perfect! Thank you! How much do I owe you?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 04.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' If you hadn't shown up, these stones would have just sat here collecting dust. I'll take 3,000 Mora for both.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 05.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Here you go... By the way, I heard you mention Vichama just now. You running an errand for him, then?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 06.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' How's he doing? Mallko's been gone for five years, now. It's about time he started to move forward.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you know what happened between them?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 07.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' I heard about it in passing while I was out drinking one night, but I don't know all the details. Vichama and Mallko grew up together and even made a name for themselves together.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 08.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Mallko was an amazing fighter, capable of knocking out multiple opponents in a single hit, while Vichama excelled at scouting and analyzing the battlefield. The two made an excellent team, and managed to beat back the Abyss several times.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 09.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Five years ago, they both emerged triumphant in the [[Pilgrimage]] and were placed on the same team to fight the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 10.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' But on the eve of battle, the Abyss launched an attack on their tribe, and Vichama suffered an injury to his leg while attempting to rescue someone.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then what happened?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 11.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' The team agreed that he couldn't go fight the Abyss in his condition.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 12.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Vichama didn't argue. He knew going to the front lines with an injured leg would make him a burden in battle. So, they raised the issue with the [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]], and she agreed to let him stay behind.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 13.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' It's just... Mallko and the others ended up facing hordes of Abyssal monsters in numbers that far exceeded anyone's expectations. The team made an error in judgment, and they fell to the onslaught.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 14.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Vichama went into a deep depression after that. He blames himself for everything.
:{{DIcon}} It was an impossible situation...
:{{DIcon}} It doesn't sound like it was his fault.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 15.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' You're not wrong. But, it's possible he chooses to blame himself, not because he did something wrong, but because he wasn't able to do anything at all.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 16.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' I've tried convincing him to move forward, to stop dwelling on the past. But, the shadow of Mallko's death hangs over him still.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 17.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' The Abyss has caused so much suffering, and some wounds never heal. I wish there was something he could do to make himself feel better, but... *sigh*
:{{A|vo ntaq005 4 pajaten 18.ogg}} '''Pajaten:''' Anyway, that's the gist of it. Maybe you could help him talk things through sometime. I would really appreciate it.

:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 vichama 03.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' As agreed, I'll help you find Kachina's Ancient Name, and then you return the favor.

:{{DIcon}} Are you seeking your friend's Ancient Name...
:{{DIcon}} ...For the same reason as us?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 vichama 05.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' ...Yes.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 vichama 06.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' After Mallko fell, I scoured the battlefield to see what happened. It turned out... he wasn't bested by some impossibly powerful foe. He was dragged to his grave by the sheer number of enemies.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 vichama 07.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' If I had been there, I would've been able to sense the danger. I could've warned them not to advance...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 vichama 08.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' I've always blamed myself for what happened... But, when you told me about Kachina, I realized there's a chance Mallko might also be alive, fighting for survival in the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... that happened several years ago, right?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Pyro Archon said all life within the Night Kingdom eventually becomes one with the sea of souls...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 vichama 09.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' There might not be much hope, but I still have to try. Mallko and I promised each other... Even if we never managed to root out the Abyss for good, we would fight together until the end.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 vichama 10.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Alright, let's get to it. I'll start searching for the "conceptualized" version of Kachina's Ancient Name. If you see any "fragments" scattered around the area, please collect them.
:;(Vichama begins, and the area darkens)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 5 vichama 11.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Make sure you prepare yourselves for battle. As I said, the Stone will link the mortal realm to the Night Kingdom. The Abyss will likely emerge in response.

:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The Stone's power was spiraling out of control. The only way to stop it was to destroy it.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You were all caught in the shockwave of the explosion. You might feel dizzy for a while, but that's normal.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Give us a heads up next time, will you? You're lucky we managed to dodge in time.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I thought I said to get back...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, barely a second before you made it go poof! Not everyone has your reflexes, Chasca. We were THIS close to getting dragged into the explosion!

:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 pisac 02.ogg}} '''Pisac:''' Haha, too bad no one will get to hear them.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 pisac 03.ogg}} '''Pisac:''' I never thought I'd actually die on this mission. *sigh* Not that I'm afraid to die, it's just... hard, thinking about my mom's face when she hears the news...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mallko 02.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Guess I have something to be thankful for, then. My parents died a long time ago... They won't have to mourn me.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 pisac 04.ogg}} '''Pisac:''' ...
:;(Pisac closes his eyes)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mallko 03.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Pisac? Hah, always had to beat me at everything, didn't you... Right to the end, you never were one for goodbyes.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mallko 04.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Maybe you're right, maybe no one will get to hear our last words. But, just in case...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mallko 05.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Vichama, I'm so glad you didn't come with us.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mallko 06.ogg}} '''Mallko:''' Don't be sad. Just keep on living... for the both of us.
:;(Rifthound Whelps arrive at Mallko and Pisac's location)
;(The memory ends)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 12.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Was that... a memory?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Seems like we were able to salvage something after all.
:{{DIcon}} Feeling any better, Vichama?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 13.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Of course. Seeing him, hearing his voice again... It makes me unbelievably happy.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 14.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' ...But, it also brings with it an even deeper pain.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A deeper pain? Why?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 15.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Mallko was always the type to put on a brave face, but in that memory just now... his hands were shaking, and his smile was forced.
:{{DIcon}} Really?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, you're right...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 16.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' For all these years, I regretted not being able to fight alongside him to the end. And now I know... At the end of his life, he was thinking the same thing.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Vichama...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 17.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' I'm fine... Actually, I heard Chief Wayna wasn't really on board with your plan to go to the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 18.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' When you asked for my help, I hesitated, too. I knew helping you find your friend's Ancient Name meant leading you one step closer to danger.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 19.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' But... I also understood why you had to try. Everyone has regrets in life, but not everyone gets the chance to make up for them.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 20.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Once allowed to fester, guilt strips us of our most valuable qualities as warriors. In that sense, we might as well choose the braver path from the very beginning...
:{{DIcon}} A more courageous way?
:{{DIcon}} You mean fighting while injured?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 21.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' If I could do it all over again, I would have followed Mallko to the frontlines no matter what. Even with an injured leg, there were still things I could have done.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 22.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' That way... even if the outcome stayed the same, I still would have fought alongside him to the end.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 23.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' There are critical junctures in life, and if you don't seize the chance to act, there's no going back.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 24.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' That's something I had to learn in hindsight, but you're still at the crossroads of your journey, so... I hope you can walk away without regrets.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Thank you, Vichama. I feel even more determined, now. Kachina will come back to us &mdash; I'll make sure of it.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I promised I would find her, and I intend to keep that promise.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 25.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' That's good to hear. *cough* Strange... My body, it's...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Once Abyssal corrosion enters the body, a portion will fuse itself to your internal organs. Even though {{Traveler}} possesses powers of purification, the corrosion can never be fully eradicated.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 chasca 13a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq005 6 chasca 13b.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Thanks to {{MC|m=him|f=her}}, though, you were only briefly exposed. Slowing your breathing and controlling your emotions should help you keep the symptoms in check.
:;(A short amount of time passes)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 vichama 26.ogg}} '''Vichama:''' Phew... That does make me feel better. You seem very knowledgeable about all this.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 chasca 14.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Just speaking from experience, that's all.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Anyway, we've recovered Kachina's Ancient Name, so we're off to a great start. Let's get Vichama back to his tribe and tell Wayna the good news.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 6 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, um... and apologize for destroying the Spiritspeaker Stone. We had no choice, though, so he'll probably understand... right?

:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 02.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Chuychu, are you really gonna just stand there like that? I don't know what you want from me...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 02.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I think you know exactly what I'm trying to say, Uncle Wayna. I can hear it in your voice.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 03.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Honestly, it's just one thing after another with you two...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 04.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Ah, they're back.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Chuychu? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Hah, don't play dumb with your own sister! You know exactly why I'm here.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 04.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' My apologies, everyone, I just need to borrow Chasca for a few minutes.... You, come with me.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' *sigh*... I'll be just a moment.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who was that?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 05.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Chuychu... Chasca's younger sister, although the two aren't actually related by blood. It's kind of a long story...
:{{DIcon}} Right! She did call herself Chasca's "sister" just now.
:{{DIcon}} But, it feels like there's more to the story...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 06.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' It's not really my story to tell, but I guess it's not a secret... You see, Chasca was actually raised by [[Qucusaur]]s.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 07.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' She was afflicted with a rare disease when she was a child and abandoned in the wild as a result. The Abyss found her out there, all on her own, and tried to devour her. But, in the end, all that did was trigger her will to live.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 08.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' That strength of will pushed her to survive, but it also planted a seed of "conflict" within her. Eventually, she was adopted by the Qucusaurs. Wherever they went, she followed, getting into fights right and left.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For some reason, Paimon can totally imagine that...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 09.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Haha, well, when Chasca finally returned to human society, it was Chuychu's parents who adopted her. At the time, Chasca still had a habit of getting into fights, so Chuychu was always taking her around, apologizing to everyone.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Aww, I remember those days! One of those fights was definitely with me... But, you know kids... You're fighting one minute, and you're friends the next!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Eventually, she found a way to rein in that desire to fight, and now she's who people call to resolve conflicts. She's known as "the Peacemaker."
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' ...It sounds like she still argues with Chuychu, though. Don't siblings usually stop fighting when they get older?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 10.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' *sigh* That's partly my fault. Chuychu asked me to stop Chasca from doing anything dangerous, but you probably know by now, once Chasca makes up her mind, there's no changing it.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Ahh, I get it. No wonder you tried to talk us out of going to the Night Kingdom. Chasca even said that wasn't like you.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 11.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I'm all for your adventure. You need to take risks when you're young, 'cause by the time you're my age, you couldn't attempt something like that even if you wanted to. Better try now than live with regrets later, that's what I say.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 12.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Still, I can understand where Chuychu's coming from. In the end, nobody wants to sit back and let a loved one put their life on the line.

:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I don't have anything to say. You don't have to approve, but you should know I only do what's necessary.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 06.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' That attitude is exactly the problem. It's like you don't care! You try to sneak off to the Night Kingdom behind my back, and then play it down, as if it's just a trip abroad.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Well... technically, I am going abroad, right?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 07.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Again with the excuses!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 08.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' We agreed, didn't we? There are four levels of danger. If it's not something urgent, you can only engage in level 2 danger and below. You can only go up to level 3 if a situation is so dire, there's absolutely no alternative.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 09.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' But, a trip to the Night Kingdom? If that's not a level 4, I don't know what is. And you were just going to sneak into the place without saying anything!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' What do you mean, sneak into the place? I always planned on walking in there with my head held high.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 10.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' You bought off Uncle Wayna, didn't you? He promised me he'd stop you from doing anything dangerous. It's like he didn't even try!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You feel like he went back on his word? What if I told you my mind was made up, and there was nothing he could have done &mdash; not even by force?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 11.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I knew it! So he did try to say something, but you didn't listen!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' This is important. If you were in my shoes, you'd make the same decision.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 12.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' You don't know that. I'm a doctor, and I handle logistics. If you're going to waltz into a dangerous situation where you could lose control at any moment, it's my duty to say something.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Alright, whatever. Anything else?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 13.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' You... What do you mean, "anything else"? Why don't you reflect on what you've done, and promise me you'll stay put.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Time out... Is this one of our normal arguments, or a serious one?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 14.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Chasca, does it sound like I'm joking?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Then, you need to know something. What happened to Kachina was partially my fault. I can't leave her there to die. That's not who I am.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 15.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' But, the person you become when you lose control... That's also not who you are!
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' That's a different issue. You said it yourself &mdash; a person is only as good as their morals. If I want to live in Natlan, I need to display qualities that make me worthy of this nation.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 16.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I've also told you that managing your condition is equally important.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 13.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices. Alright, let's stop this here. If we keep going, I might actually have to get serious, and I think Wayna prefers his roof attached to his house.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 17.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Is that a threat? That sounds like a threat to me.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 14.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Chuychu! Younger sisters are supposed to listen to their elders.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 18.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chuychu 19.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' So, you're really going to go? No matter what I say? I'm supposed to be your sister...

:;(Chuychu leaves and Chasca returns to the group)
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 13.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' *sigh*... You two are something else...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 16.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Something you wanted to say?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 14.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I know you aren't related by blood, but you two sure are similar.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 17.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Really?
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 15.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' ...Y'know, I said that very thing to Chuychu not too long ago, and she reacted the exact same way, down to the very tone of voice.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 16.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' It's not my place to get involved, but I will say this... Try to spend a little more time with your sister. You're tough kids, but that doesn't mean you have to go it alone.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 18.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Thank you.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 17.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Anytime... Alright, if you're done with the Spiritspeaker Stone, you might as well hand it over.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 18.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' According to Kinich, it's an important ceremonial artifact, so it'd be safer to keep it with me.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Um, about that...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh*... If only Tone-Deaf Bard was here. He could have "repaired" it just like the Holy Lyre...
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 chasca 19.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...It might be in a few more pieces than you remember.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 19.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Huh?
:{{Black Screen|You explain the sequence of events to Wayna...}}
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 20.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I see... *sigh* Sounds like it was an urgent situation. If someone's life was on the line, then you had no choice.
:{{A|vo ntaq005 7 wayna 21.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Still, Citlali's gonna be a nightmare to deal with now that you've broken her stuff. I'll explain everything to her later.
