Athos's Grocery sold vegetables, kitchenware, and sewing materials.<br>
It was [[Athos (Fontaine)|Athos]]'s pride and joy, but the jeweler [[Brandt]] used underhanded methods to destroy both his stall and his life.<br>
Athos stabbed him to death in revenge and dumped his corpse in the [[Salacia Plain]].<br>
To murder someone is, of course, a crime. But is the victim necessarily entirely innocent?<br>
Brandt got his just deserts, while Athos will spend the rest of his life in hiding.

All those who know the full story, if you are willing to help Athos get the truth out,<br>
{{color|buzzword|Please look for the thank-you gifts he has left on the beach between the waterfalls}}. Your kindness should be rewarded.
