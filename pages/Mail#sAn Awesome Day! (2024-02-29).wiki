|text      = My birthday is coming! That's something that only happens once every 4 years, of course I've got to plan in advance, so that I'd be prepared for the day's schedule from the moment I opened my eyes! I've gotta thank my dads, spend some time talking with them, then visit friends, and share the rare good luck my birthday brings with everyone! I also wanna do a bunch of really memorable things, like inviting you to go adventure together in a new domain, and have [[Paimon]] take pictures of us with the [[Kamera]]!

In fact, I was just there turning it over and over in my head all night, and I ended up not sleeping a wink at all. Before I knew it, the birds outside my window had already started chirping...

No way could I just keep lying there, so might as well just forget about sleeping! Get a move on first, and as for the rest...Well, let's play it by ear.

The big cake's already on the table, and I'll cut it once you get here!
