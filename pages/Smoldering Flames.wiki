'''Smoldering Flames''' is a [[Ley Line Disorder]] that deals {{Color|Pyro DMG}} over time.

It can be removed via [[Elemental Reactions]]. If applied as a domain debuff, the player can also reduce the time affected by the debuff by using an artifact from [[Prayers for Illumination]] or the {{color|Hydro|Soothing Water}} [[Elemental Resonance]]. However, the duration-shortening methods do not work if the debuff is applied by an enemy.

Smoldering Flames cannot damage off-field characters. Switching to a different character after becoming affected by Smoldering Flames will temporarily pause its DoT ticks. However, if the character becomes the active character again while still affected by Smoldering Flames, the DoT ticks will resume.

==Overview==
{{See also|Elemental Reaction/Level Scaling#Level Multiplier}}
The {{Color|Pyro DMG}} dealt by Smoldering Flames is calculated as <math>\text{Multiplier} \times \text{Level Multiplier}</math>. This DMG is affected by the player's [[Pyro RES]], but unaffected by [[DEF]] or [[DMG Reduction]]. The final result is rounded down.
