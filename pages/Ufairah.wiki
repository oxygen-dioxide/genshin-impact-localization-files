'''Ufairah Hindi''' is an unseen character mentioned in the [[Golden Slumber]] [[World Quest]] series.

==Profile==
Ufairah was the wife of [[Jebrael]] and mother of [[Jeht]]. She was one of the researchers hired by the [[Thutmose]] group to investigate the legends of the secrets of [[Al-Ahmar]], involved in a project regarding a "[[Scarlet Sand Slate]]." During her research, she encountered Jebrael and married him, leaving her family in the process. [[Samail]], another member of Thutmose, soon came to believe that Jebrael's feelings towards Ufairah were "infecting" his resolve and eventually killed her in an attempt to "cure" it to no avail, as he ended up leaving regardless.

[[Tirzad]] is her relative, who recalled that she was a researcher of limitless potential. 

===Appearance===
Her most notable features, from Jebrael's perspective, were her soft curly hair and innocent smile.
