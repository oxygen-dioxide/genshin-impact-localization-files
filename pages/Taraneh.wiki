:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Taraneh:''' Hehe, it seems that you need to be more careful.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Taraneh:''' H- How did... No. I have to rethink my deck composition.
:{{DIcon}} Meh.
::'''Taraneh:''' There's something going on, isn't there?
::'''Taraneh:''' So it isn't just me... Everyone has their bad days...
::'''Taraneh:''' But it's okay! That's just life &mdash; sometimes we get hurt, and sometimes we get to sing happy songs.
::'''Taraneh:''' A heartless sailor from foreign lands once broke my heart. But look at me now, I can still dance!
::'''Taraneh:''' Ah, I forgot to mention that I am a street performer. Come see me dance if you're in a bad mood!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I can teach him a lesson for you.
