|text      = These days, I find myself lacking inspiration, and my words do not flow as they should when writing poetry. I thought about seeking inspiration far and wide, but instead stumbled upon a book on divination at [[Wanwen Bookhouse]]...

Believe it or not, it turned out to be quite amusing! I divined that [[Xiangling]] would encounter a "crimson omen" yesterday, and lo and behold, she found some exquisite [[Jueyun Chili]] in a basket of rice...

No wonder her rice has been so fragrant and spicy lately!

So, I decided to divine my own fortune based on my birth date, and surprisingly, the result was "a friend as precious as gilded gold, bringing great fortune to both."

Oh my, who else could this be referring to? Hehe, how interesting!

I've already prepared a meal, so hurry over and let's catch up, old friend. Let's see how we can bring ourselves some great fortune today!
