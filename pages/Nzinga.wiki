:'''Battuta:''' W&mdash;Wait a moment, time out! This is way too much exercise for a scholar like me...
:'''Nzinga:''' What, for real? But you've only done a tiny bit more since our last outing. Training load's gotta go up sometime.
:'''Nzinga:''' Can't start teaching you how to wrestle properly until your basic fitness is up to snuff.
:'''Nzinga:''' Aren't you looking forward to the day when you'll unleash your inner beast for the whole world to see?
:'''Battuta:''' Well, not like I'm going pro, is it... I just wanted to get a little &mdash; emphasis on "a little" &mdash; exercise...
:'''Nzinga:''' I see... Shame. You're quite the looker, you know? The crowds would love you.
:'''Battuta:''' Huh!? Wh&mdash;What kind of marketing tactic is that?
:'''Nzinga:''' Hmm? I think you might've gotten the wrong end of the stick &mdash; I wasn't planning on charging you. I have to exercise myself, so helping someone else out in the meantime's no sweat off my back.
:'''Battuta:''' Okay, I... I guess I'll give this another shot, then?
