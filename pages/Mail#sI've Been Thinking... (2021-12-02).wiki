|text    = I've heard my colleagues say that among humans, birthdays are very special and are important occasions to be celebrated. They are days to go to places where you normally wouldn't go, and spend [[Mora]] on things you wouldn't normally buy. Only then would they be considered birthdays.

But for me, the passage of time is a trivial thing. I'm always very busy on my birthdays, and they always go by the same way every year.

During my nap today, you unexpectedly appeared in my dream. You said something to me with a smile... Unfortunately, I can't seem to remember what you said after I woke up.

Maybe it's a sign that there's something you want to tell me? Perhaps I should take this opportunity to meet you... Either way, I've prepared a gift according to [[Liyue]] customs.

Here are some [[Qingxin Seed|Qingxin seeds]], so you can experience the joy of planting and harvesting. Ah... there's no more room left to write about tips on planting and tending but it's alright, let's just discuss it when we meet.
