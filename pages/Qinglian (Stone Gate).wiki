==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Qinglian:''' *cough* Hello, Traveler... *cough* I'm sorry, I'm terribly ill at the moment, one part of which is this dreadful cough...
:{{DIcon}} You look well to me...
::'''Qinglian:''' Oh, really? ...Is it that obvious? Yikes, I've been outed...
::'''Qinglian:''' *sigh* Okay, I'll come clean. But please, whatever you do, do not tell my husband.
::'''Qinglian:''' My husband is a sailor. I barely saw him for years as he spent all his time out at sea...
::'''Qinglian:''' But since I feel ill, he gave all that up to care for me full time. He even hand-picks medicine for me from way up in the mountains.
::'''Qinglian:''' Of course, we're poorer now that we don't have an income. But these have been the happiest days of my life. And each time I think about him leaving back out to sea when I'm all better...
::'''Qinglian:''' I can't bear the thought. I don't have the courage to face up to it. So instead, I have feigned illness ever since I recovered...
::'''Qinglian:''' *sigh* What a selfish woman I am...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} The two of you really work very hard.
:::'''Qinglian:''' It's true, but right now, my body no longer requires that many herbs - what I need is my husband by my side.
:::'''Qinglian:''' Thanks for hearing me out. If you don't mind, let me give these to you.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Qingxin|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Get well soon...
::'''Qinglian:''' Thank you, that means a lot. *cough*
