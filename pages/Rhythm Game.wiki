| The Rhythm Rings will appear before the beat and will shrink over time. When the Rhythm Ring {{Color|buzzword|aligns precisely}} with the button press area, it is time to press the button and play some music! But get it wrong and you'll miss the beat...

|[[Dawn Winery Theme]]
|Ragnvindr once lifted the curtain of dawn over Mondstadt, singing the high song of liberation.<br />When the dust of warfare settled, the sword-wielding knight would return home, watching the winery and tending to the peaceful orchards, waiting for the coming of every first light of dawn...

|Fondest Strength
|[[Tender Strength]]
|There is an unspoken rule that runs through the Knights of Favonius: treat one's comrades with the utmost gentleness and acceptance, till they know one another as they know themselves.<br />That way, they shall aid each other in their travels, rather than cause the other to stumble...

|Frost Parable
|[[Moonlike Smile]]
|If one arises and looks to the south from Mondstadt, one will gaze upon Dragonspine, the mountain of long-buried secrets that covers sky and sea like a towering white wall. But though the bitter cold is frightening indeed, the footsteps of those that seek truth will not be turned back, not even by the frigid winds...

|An Old Friend's Send-Off
|Bishui Plain theme
|A secret pain lies buried under the towering giant tree beneath Mt. Hulao, where someone once sent an old friend off. Yet it was unavoidable, wasn't it? Whether they be gods or spirits, that which the years bring, the years must also take away in the end...

|As the Clouds Guard the Moon
|[[Good Night, Liyue]]
|Much difference there is in beholding Liyue from a distant mountain as opposed to overlooking the mortal realms from the clouds above. Yet wherever one might dwell, one's will to defend the land and guide its people shall never waver. Not in the slightest...

|The Winding Way
|[[Maiden's Longing]]
|TThe mountains to the south of Liyue are treacherous and barren, little-known and little-inhabited. Yet even in this corner of the world, the footprints of a character most diligent may be found. To her, perhaps, these are nothing more than baby steps compared to the path that lies ahead of Liyue.

|Lone Tower in the West
|[[Lovers' Oath]]
|Just as evil must be conquered and filth must be cleansed, so too do silent sorrows, unfathomable solitude, and inexplicable resentment need redress. Scale the Wangshu Inn, which overlooks the peaceful lands of Liyue, with almond tofu as lovely as sweet dreams in your hand — and you too can help to resolve such problems...

|Sangonomiya's Depths
|[[Streets of Elegance]]
|The sacred and lovely Sangonomiya Shrine is the holy sanctum of Watatsumi's people. The Divine Priestess who dwells therein has inherited the will to protect this land. Even in this remote border realm far from Inazuma's center, this leader tirelessly seeks to bring peace and prosperity to her people...

|Forest Watch
|[[Hakushin's Lullaby]]
|"They say that a great and mighty youkai dwells within Chinju Forest. It once waited for its good friend to return, but though it waited till the sun no longer rose, its friend returned not."<br />"Did it eventually lose patience?" The outlander Traveler asked.<br />"I... I suppose it did, in the end..." The young lady answered in her heart, her eyes lowered to the ground.

|Where to Next?
|[[Separated Dream]]
|When eternity is no longer an obsession, when a god walks amongst mortals, when an answer is found to the question "where to next?" — Perhaps then, the Eternal Euthymia may truly become Inazuma's future...
