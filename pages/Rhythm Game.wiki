|An Old Friend's Send-Off
|[[Lingering Bitterness]]
|A secret pain lies buried under the towering giant tree beneath Mt. Hulao, where someone once sent an old friend off. Yet it was unavoidable, wasn't it? Whether they be gods or spirits, that which the years bring, the years must also take away in the end...

|As the Clouds Guard the Moon
|[[Good Night, Liyue]]

|[[Hakushin's Lullaby]]
|"They say that a great and mighty youkai dwells within Chinju Forest. It once waited for its good friend to return, but though it waited till the sun no longer rose, its friend returned not."<br>"Did it eventually lose patience?" The outlander Traveler asked.<br>"I... I suppose it did, in the end..." The young lady answered in her heart, her eyes lowered to the ground.
