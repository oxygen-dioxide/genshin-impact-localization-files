'''Invigorating Pizza''' is a [[:Category:Special Dishes|special]] [[food]] item that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Mushroom Pizza]] with [[Jean]]. The [[recipe]] for Mushroom Pizza is obtainable inside a Precious Chest at [[Stormterror's Lair]]. Alternatively, players can obtain the recipe directly during [[Kamisato Ayaka]]'s [[The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit|Story Quest]], ''[[Food From Afar]]''.

Invigorating Pizza restores '''34'''% of Max HP to the selected character and regenerates '''980''' HP every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==Notes==
* Jean's passive talent, [[Guiding Breeze]], can also activate when successfully creating Invigorating Pizza.

==Trivia==
* To celebrate Jean's birthday, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] published a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/14518 real-life recipe] for [[Mushroom Pizza]] and Invigorating Pizza. Compared to regular Mushroom Pizza, Invigorating Pizza replaces arugula with green bell peppers and adds Jueyun Chili.
*The following birthday mails included Invigorating Pizza:
** [[Birthday/Jean#How Does One Celebrate a Birthday?|Jean's 2021 Birthday Mail]] (1 Invigorating Pizza)
** [[Birthday/Jean#A Productive Day|Jean's 2022 Birthday Mail]] (1 Invigorating Pizza)
* Giving [[Lisa]] an Invigorating Pizza in her Story Quest, [[Troublesome Work (Quest)|Troublesome Work]], will result in a unique dialogue option.
