==Story==
===History===
Moon Carver was among the adepti rallied by Morax, the Geo Archon, to fight in the [[Archon War]]. Either during this time or some time after the war's end, Moon Carver and [[Mountain Shaper]] were two of the three adepti who fought and sealed [[Azhdaha]].<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Hidden in Nameless Treasures}}</ref>

===Present===
After the Stormterror Crisis was resolved, [[Venti]] informed the [[Traveler]] to head to Liyue to meet with Morax during the Rite of Descension or they would have to wait the following year.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> When they arrived to witness the rite, they were instead greeted with Morax's corpse and labeled suspects due to being foreigners. The Traveler was able to escape with the help of [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Harbinger]] [[Tartaglia|Childe]], who suggested they speak to the adepti and gave them a [[Sigil of Permission]] to ensure the adepti would not attack them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of Descension}}</ref>

Arriving in [[Jueyun Karst]], Moon Carver was the first to greet the Traveler and [[Paimon]]. He was enraged to learn of Morax's supposed demise and that the Millelith had blamed foreigners without probable cause. At that moment, a group of Millelith pursuing the Traveler arrived, who they drove out per the adepti's request. After learning of the full situation, he sent them off to inform Mountain Shaper, Cloud Retainer and Xiao of the news.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Impromptu Change of Plan}}</ref> Moon Carver later assisted the Millelith in defeating [[Osial]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Turning Point}}</ref> and agreed to let mortals govern Liyue, learning that Morax had simply stepped down from his role.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

<section begin="events"/>During the second Lantern Rite without [[Morax]], Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper went on a brief journey, returning to the mountains just as the fireworks festival was about to start in Liyue.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Stars Inscribe the Year's Wishes}}</ref> During the next Lantern Rite, they reunited with Morax (now in the form of [[Zhongli]]) and were joined by the Traveler and Paimon before enjoying some [[Bamboo Shoot Soup]] cooked with [[Cloud Retainer]]'s adeptal mechanism.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul}}</ref>

As the fourth Lantern Rite approached, Cloud Retainer, having assumed the human form of [[Xianyun]], took up residence in [[Liyue Harbor]] and failed to visit him and Mountain Shaper, so the two also transformed into humans and went to the harbor hoping to find her. There, they were found by Paimon listening in on her talking with the Traveler, [[Keqing]] and [[Charlotte]] about kite-making with [[Fontaine]]'s technology. Upon being confronted, Moon Carver revealed his identity but asked to be addressed as Houzhang, while Mountain Shaper named himself Jiehu. Paimon refused to believe them to be the adepti she knew, so they had to recount some of their previous experiences only known to them to convince her and the Traveler. Having learnt the theme of this year's Lantern Rite, they decided that Cloud Retainer was in no mood of greeting them due to her low opinion of mortal technology, and thus departed.<ref name="The Orioles Bask in Spring, the Heavens Present Auspices"/>

Two days later, Houzhang and Jiehu were near [[Mt. Aocang]] when they tried out the Fontainian motor technology with a kite depicting the [[Jade Chamber]] and accidentally lost it. Having seen it drifting in the direction of the mountain, Jiehu was afraid it might be discovered by Xianyun, but Houzhang was confident that she would not be out in the vicinity. Unbeknownst to them, Xianyun was running a kite-making workshop and happened to intercept the kite, which prompted her to go investigate at once. The two became flustered the moment she appeared in person, and after some private exchange, decided to play dumb, but Paimon then arrived with the Traveler and immediately exposed their identities. Xianyun, however, claimed she had long known and had wanted to know how long the two could keep up the pretense. They tried to flatter her mechanical prowess, but she dismissed them and left. They then determined to continue flying the kite at [[Mt. Hulao]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Cloud-Sea Appeal, a Brilliance Revealed (Quest)}}</ref>

Having learnt of the discord between [[Gaming]] and his father [[Yip Tak]] that arose from the former's career choices, Xianyun was eager to help them resolve their differences in light of the festive occasion, and thus in the next two days enlisted the help of Houzhang and Jiehu, asking them to play the roles of [[Treasure Hoarders]] pretending to attack Gaming while escorting goods in the presence of his father. When the plan was carried out, Gaming was quick to defend himself and even prepared to strike first, so Houzhang and Jiehu retreated with the intention of luring him away. While pursuing them, Gaming astutely sensed from their actual abilities that they weren't usual ruthless bandits, and deduced that it had been staged. The plans however were ultimately successful, and when the festivities at Liyue Harbor began, Houzhang and Jiehu watched as Yip Tak enjoyed Gaming's Wushou Dance.<ref name="The Glede Returns to the Pavilion"/><section end="events"/>

At the next Lantern Rite, Zhongli, Xianyun, Madame Ping, Mountain Shaper and Moon Carver convened at Mt. Aocang, talking about the resolved [[fetor]] issue and the current director of the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]], [[Hu Tao]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Final Stanza: The Sanctification of Tao Dou}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* During the Closed Beta Tests, Moon Carver's name was translated as "Perfected Lord of Descending Sun and Ascending Moon," which was a more direct translation of his original Chinese name.
** The title {{Lang|"Perfected Lord"|zh=真君|zh_rm=Zhēnjūn}} is typically ascribed to the {{w|Xian (Taoism)|''xian''}} (Taoist immortals), whom the adepti are modeled after.
* Based on the Chinese version of [[Xingqiu]]'s [[Xingqiu/Voice-Overs|Voice-Over]], "Interesting Things...", Moon Carver may have rescued him from a perilous situation in the past.
