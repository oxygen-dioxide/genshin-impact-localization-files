'''Moon Carver''' is an [[adeptus]] who dwells on [[Qingyun Peak]].

He is a story [[NPC]] who first appears during the [[Archon Quest]] "[[An Impromptu Change of Plan]]."

==Profile==
===Introduction===
{{Quote
|Moon Carver, disciple of [[Rex Lapis]]. The kindest adeptus amongst all, in the manifestation of a stag.
|Stone tablet on Qingyun Peak.
}}

===Personality===
Moon Carver is called the "kindest" of the adepti, though this description is only relative to the other adepti; he is willing to appear directly before the [[Traveler]] instead of making them go through hoops like [[Mountain Shaper]], [[Cloud Retainer]], and [[Xiao]] do. However, he only grants the Traveler this honor due to the [[Sigil of Permission]] in their possession. When the [[Millelith]] trespass onto [[Jueyun Karst]] to arrest the Traveler, he orders the Traveler to drive them off.

===Appearance===
Moon Carver takes the form of a stag.

==Story==
===History===
Moon Carver was among the adepti rallied by Morax, the Geo Archon, to fight in the [[Archon War]]. Either during this time or some time after the war's end, Moon Carver and [[Mountain Shaper]] were two of the three adepti who fought and sealed [[Azhdaha]].<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Hidden in Nameless Treasures}}</ref>

===Present===
After the Stormterror Crisis was resolved, [[Venti]] informed the Traveler to head to Liyue to meet with Morax during the Rite of Descension or they would have to wait the following year. When they arrived to witness the rite, they were instead greeted with Morax's corpse and labeled suspects due to being foreigners. The Traveler was able to escape with the help of [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Harbinger]] [[Tartaglia|Childe]], who suggested they speak to the adepti and gave them a [[Sigil of Permission]] to ensure the adepti would not attack them.

Arriving in [[Jueyun Karst]], Moon Carver was the first to greet the Traveler. He was enraged to learn of Morax's supposed demise and that the Millelith had blamed foreigners without probable cause. At that moment, a group of Millelith pursuing the Traveler arrived, who they drove out per the adepti's request. After learning of the full situation, he sent them off to inform Mountain Shaper, Cloud Retainer and Xiao of the news. Moon Carver later assisted the Millelith in defeating [[Osial]] and agreed to let mortals govern Liyue, learning that Morax had simply stepped down from his role.

During the first Lantern Rite without Morax, Moon Carver went on a brief journey alongside Mountain Shaper, returning to the mountains just as the fireworks festival was about to start in Liyue.

==Trivia==
* During the Closed Beta Tests, Moon Carver's name was translated as "Perfected Lord of Descending Sun and Ascending Moon," which was a more direct translation of his original Chinese name.
** The title {{Lang|"Perfected Lord"|zh=真君|zh_rm=Zhēnjūn}} is typically ascribed to the {{w|Xian (Taoism)|''xian''}} (Taoist immortals), whom the adepti are modeled after.
* Based on the Chinese version of [[Xingqiu]]'s [[Xingqiu/Voice-Overs|Voice-Over]], "Interesting Things...", Moon Carver may have rescued him from a perilous situation in the past.
