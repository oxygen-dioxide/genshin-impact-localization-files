==History==
{{Wish History Table}}

==Trivia==
*This was the second series of event wishes to all contain a new 4 star character, [[Xinyan]] for the first, and [[Yanfei]] for the second. The first series that did this was the first two runs of the [[Farewell of Snezhnaya]] series.
**Coincidentally, both characters are [[Liyue]] {{Pyro}} [[Vision]] wielders.
**This is different from the Farewell of Snezhnaya series, where the two new 4 star characters, [[Diona]] and [[Rosaria]], are [[Mondstadt]] {{Cryo}} Vision holders.
