'''Windmill Mechanisms''',<ref>Official Interactive Map: [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=65 Teyvat]</ref> colloquially known as '''Anemo Pinwheels''' or '''Windmills''', are items that can only be activated by striking them with {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

Once activated, they will spin for a while before stopping, and will need to be reactivated. Typically, Windmill Mechanisms will either generate wind currents or spawn hidden chests.
