{{Description|Surprisingly, [[Jean]] and [[Lisa]] were searching for the truth about the Serpent of Black Fire as well. [[Amber]] decided to contribute whatever she had in this investigation.}}
'''Surprise Finding''' is Chapter 4 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
[[The Doctor|Dottore]] creates a metal golem based on [[Krupp]].

In [[Mondstadt]], [[Jean]] and [[Lisa]] question a hesitant [[Amber]] about her investigation. With no further information on the incident, Jean and Lisa suggest searching the [[Mondstadt Library|Library of Mondstadt]]. The [[Collei|girl]] begs to join them in hopes of finding her answers there. At the library, the [[Knights of Favonius|knights]] agree to share intel on their searches. Amber, knowing she hasn't done any investigating due to [[Kaeya]], lies. She notices a burned paper on the table and suddenly leaves while the girl remains with Lisa.

Amber, remembering Dottore bearing the symbol of the [[Fatui]], returns home to grab her supplies and heads off.
