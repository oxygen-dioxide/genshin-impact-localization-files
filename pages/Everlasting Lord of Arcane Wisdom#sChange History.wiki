* Removed the second confirmation pop-up window for skipping the second phase cutscene. Now, clicking "skip" will directly skip the cutscene without a need for confirmation.

[[Version 3.3]]
* Fixes an issue where there would be a small chance that the character would remain in the high speed state when players use the Four-Leaf Sigil to move quickly at the moment of switching characters.
* Fixes an issue whereby his Setsuna Shoumetsu skill released in the second combat phase would not apply normally under certain circumstances.
* Fixes an issue whereby when he is suppressed while unleashing certain skills in the first combat phase, those skills would still take effect abnormally under certain circumstances.
* Fixes an issue whereby constructs still appear abnormally after the boss Shouki no Kami, the Prodigal has been defeated (although these constructs cannot deal DMG).
* One Japanese voice has been changed. (七葉の下、生き永えらえるのは僕だけだ！→七葉の下、生き永らえるのは僕だけだ！)
