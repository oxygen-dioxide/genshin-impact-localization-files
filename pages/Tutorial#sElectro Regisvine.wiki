|text1    = A predatory plant in the same vein as the [[Cryo Regisvine|Cryo]] and [[Pyro Regisvine]]s, this creature can create an organ that resembles {{Color|help|Electro Cores}} at its roots or corolla. When this type of organ starts to shift, its state will change, condensing into either a Waxing Stamen and a Waning Stamen. When the two types of stamens are present at the same time, they will {{Color|help|attract one another and then unleash a powerful electrical explosion when they make contact}}. Destroying these stamens quickly is key to an easier battle experience.
