'''Ornate Kabuto''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Emblem of Severed Fate]].

==Description==
"I've been wondering, Sir Douin, could your sword actually slice through lightning?"<br />So said the young [[Kanjou Commission|Kanjou]] Head, [[Hiiragi Hiroshi|Hiroshi]], while sheathing his blade. Douin replied thus, woodenly:<br />"How could that be possible? At most, I'd say that it could strike a Tengu in mid-air."<br />"That said, though, no one has ever brought down a tengu down before. Not even once."

"Is that so? In that case, where does the name of your secret blade, 'Tengu Sweeper,' come from?"<br />Seeing that Douin did not answer, the Kanjou Head who had built [[Ritou]] up said:<br />"Ah, if it wasn't for that old man Kujou making a move first, I would've loved to recruit you."<br />"With your sword, even [[Ako Domeki]] of Seirai would be no match..."

Cleaving through the storm clouds, that tengu had given him a new name and a new life.<br />She threw him the rusty blade and told him to strike her, a tengu, down.<br />And after his sword broke, these were her last words to him...
