:'''Riku:''' Ah, an outlander! Hello!
:{{DIcon}} Wanna play?
::'''Riku:''' Okay! Let's play Hide-and-Seek!
::'''Riku:''' ...Ah, but my sister is still working at the shrine, and I promised her that I wouldn't run around. I need to wait for her so we can go home together...
::'''Riku:''' If my sister can't find me, she'll probably worry...
::'''Riku:''' Thank you, but I think I'll just play by myself.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Riku:''' I'm counting the people coming to the shrine for fortune slips!
::'''Riku:''' There was a [[Sayu|very short girl]] in a [[tanuki]] outfit drawing a slip, wishing to grow taller or something...
::'''Riku:''' There was also a [[Kamisato Ayaka|beautiful older girl]] who wished that Inazuma will remain peaceful and stuff...
::'''Riku:''' Oh, and there was some [[Kujou Kamaji|big bro]] wishing for the Kujou Clan to be prosperous...
::'''Riku:''' Their wishes are so special. My wish is just to be able to play Hide-and-Seek with my sister...

::'''Riku:''' Okay, bye-bye!
