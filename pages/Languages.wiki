{{Stub|Need more info on [[#Mondstadt Language]] and [[#Ishine Script]]}}
There are many different '''languages''' in [[Teyvat]], most of them based on real-world languages.

Aside from [[Hilichurlian]] and Ishine Script, all language names are unofficial.

==Teyvat Language==

==Other Languages==
===Mondstadt Language===
[[File:Angel's Share Sign.png|thumb|Example of the Mondstadt Language at the bottom of the sign]]
Certain signs in Mondstadt appear to use a written language that is not the [[Teyvat Language]]. These signs have words written using the {{w|Roman alphabet}} with certain sections removed and the entire written item flipped horizontally. There is variation between likely instances of the same letter.

Signs with this language:
* An emblem of the Mondstadt branch of the Adventurers' Guild emblem; likely reads "{{Not a typo|Monde}}" ("{{Not a typo|MOnDE}}")
* Logo of the [[Angel's Share]]; likely reads "{{sic|Angle Share}}" ("{{Not a typo|ANGLEShArE}}")
* Inn sign; likely reads "Inn" ("Inn")

===Enochian-Based Language===

This is a language observed to be used by [[Abyss Mages]] to manipulate hilichurls. According to their description in the Adventurer Handbook, this long-forgotten language is what gives the Abyss Mages their magical power. This script is based on the {{w|Enochian}} alphabet, but attempts to decrypt it have only yielded unintelligible text, as the letter sequences appear to be randomly generated.

It can be seen as purple symbols above the Abyss Mage when it is manipulating hilichurls, such as in the commission [[Spreading Evil]]. The script also appears in the yellow protective runes around the weak points of [[Automatons]], where the mirrored glyphs for B, L, and G circle around the core. [[Ruin Guard]]s are known to have been made by the people of [[Khaenri'ah]], so the text is possibly used by them as well.

There is only one instance of the Enochian-based language being transcribed into a discernable language: During ''[[Crash Course]]'', the Hydro Abyss Mage says "Gohus, Chiso Vonph" in English letters. This translates from Enochian as something along the lines of "I say, they are angry."

===Runes===
[[File:Tutorial Enemies Pyro Abyss Mage.png|thumb|Example of Runes where symbols including ᛉ and ᛗ can be seen]]
Runes resembling {{w|Elder Futhark}} runes can be seen in the [[Tutorial]] images for the [[Abyss Mages]], seemingly when they are about to regenerate their shields. However, since Version 1.0, the symbols that appear around Abyss Mages are in the Enochian-Based Language instead.

===Adeptus Language===
[[File:Adeptus Language.png|thumb|Example of the Adeptus Language]]
This script has only been found on [[Adeptus Bridge]]s. It is presumably used by the [[Adepti]].

===Ishine Script===
{{See also|Ishine Script}}
[[File:Ishine Script on Mount Kanna.png|thumb|The [[Seven Letters|seven letters]] of the Ishine Script]]
The Ishine Script was only known by the priestly families in the civilization that once inhabited [[Tsurumi Island]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Octave of the Maushiro}}</ref> The language of the script was used to name people, places, and other things on the island.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna}}</ref> This language is likely based on the {{w|Ainu language}} in real life. For example, [[Kama]] means "a very big rock," which corresponds to the Ainu word {{Lang|''kama''|ain=カマ}}, meaning "flat rock." However, the letters of the Ishine Script do not bear any obvious similarities to Ainu writing.<!--There is one letter that looks like ン, but nothing obvious for any of the other letters, so it is likely only a coincidence.-->
{{clr}}

===Tanuki Language===
According to [[Ioroi]], Tanuki can understand human speech by nature, but also possess their own language amongst themselves. Ioroi is able to prepare a magical food which allows Traveler to understand some Tanuki speech but much of it still comes out as gibberish such as when [[Kichiboushi]] says "squelch squelch lavender melon." According to Ioroi, this confusion is caused by the Traveler having yet to be accustomed to Kichiboushi's aura, a statement which is supported by the fact that communication with Kichiboushi gets clearer throughout the journey with him.

==Ciphers==
=== Jade Chamber===
{{Main|Jade Chamber#Trivia}}
If you decipher the series of numbers in the Strange Notebook you get "The Fatui will strike the Golden House". The text can be deciphered by referring a book about Rex Lapis's death that can be found on Ningguang's desk. The code numbers are a modified {{w|book cipher}}, written in the format <code>[sentence]:[word]:[letter]|[letter]</code>. The letters from these codes will spell out the message.

===Record of Serial No.===
{{Main|Record of Serial No.}}
Nine Ruin Guards located throughout Dragonspine can be interacted with, giving you cryptic Record of Serial No. messages that altogether read "For the nation, we can't forgo this skyborne power, but we failed."

==Real Life Languages==

===Ainu Language===
The {{Lang|{{w|Ainu language}}|ain=アイヌ・イタㇰ|ain_rm=Ainu-itak}} serves as the basis for the language of the Ishine Script found in Tsurumi Island. Unlike the Ainu language in real life which uses small ''kana'' characters as part of its katakana-based writing system to express certain sounds, the Japanese-language version of the game opts to use mostly full-size kana in place of them; such as {{Lang|mini=1|ja=ピリカ　チカッポ　カパッチリカムイ|ja_rm=Pirika chikappo kapatchirikamui}}, instead of {{Lang|mini=1|ain=ピㇼカ　チカッポ　カパッチㇼカムィ|ain_rm=Pirka cikappo kapatcir-kamuy}}.

This particular "inflection" pattern affects place names in Tsurumi, like {{Lang|{{Lang|mini=1|ja=モシリ|ja_rm=[[Moshiri Ceremonial Site|Moshiri]]}}|ain=モシㇼ|ain_rm=mosir}} and {{Lang|{{Lang|mini=1|ja=シリコロ|ja_rm=[[Shirikoro Peak|Shirikoro]]}}|ain=シㇼコㇿ|ain_rm=sirkor}}. This also makes it difficult to identify the etymologies of some names thought to be of Ainu origin, such as {{Lang|[[Autake Plains|Autake]]|ja=アウタケ}}; which has been speculated to be a combination of the words {{Lang|mini=1|ain=アゥタ|ain_rm=awta|ain_tl=neighboring}} and {{Lang|mini=1|ain=ケ|ain_rm=ke|ain_tl=place}}; among other possible origins.

==Trivia==
* There are playing cards in the open world with the Roman alphabet on them.
* The [[Unusual Hilichurl]] has a Simplified Chinese character on its mask as a reference to Liu Wei, one of HoYoverse's co-founders.
* In the Genshin Impact [[manga]], which was published in 2018 to 2019, some papers, such as the ones on the table in the first half of Chapter 5 and the letter that Dottore receives in Chapter 9, are written in an indecipherable script. It is likely a written lingua franca. As this script has not been seen in official media since Genshin Impact's launch and all instances of the script appear to be filler text due to repetition of the same lines, this script was likely a placeholder and ultimately scrapped.
* In the manga, in Chapter 5, there is a circular stamp reading "THE CHIVALRY OF THE WEST WIND - MONDE LIBRARY" in English. The regular use of English as-is in Mondstadt has likely been scrapped.
