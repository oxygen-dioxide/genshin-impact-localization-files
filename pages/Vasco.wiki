==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Vasco:''' Should I go to [[Fontaine]] and get a diving certificate?
:{{DIcon}} Diving certificate?
::'''Vasco:''' Listen to me, don't underestimate the sea! I almost lost my life on the last voyage!
::'''Vasco:''' I was so stoked back then, surveying the sea all day with a scope, trying not to miss anything.
::'''Vasco:''' Finally, I spotted an uncharted island one day and coaxed the captain into making shore.
::'''Vasco:''' It was when we got close that we realized it was the backside of a sea monster!
::'''Vasco:''' We were chased by the awakened monster and had to follow the captain's order to start jettisoning.
::'''Vasco:''' That included my luggage, all the food aboard, and... the cook.
::{{DIcon}} The cook?
::'''Vasco:''' Listen to me. When you venture out to the sea, you don't want to be the heaviest person around!
::'''Vasco:''' I'll skip the details, but you get it, right?
::'''Vasco:''' Anyway, the captain "jettisoned" me, too, when we got back to the dock.
::'''Vasco:''' To prevent myself from the cook's fate, I'm considering getting a diving certificate from Fontaine before adventuring again.
::'''Vasco:''' But I heard the water in Fontaine is different from here, so it won't be a useful endeavor.
::'''Vasco:''' Maybe I should just stay on land?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I don't know...
:::'''Vasco:''' I understand. When you embark on an adventure, you can come across a variety of situations anywhere you go. And rainforests and deserts are infested with quite some strange things.
:::'''Vasco:''' But I'm not going to sea again anytime soon. I'll just wait and see.
:::'''Vasco:''' This bow is of little use to me now. Do you wish to take it?
:::'''Vasco:''' I thought ranged weapons like this might be useful at sea or on a deserted island, or even for bowfishing.
:::'''Vasco:''' Now that I think about it... Nah. Perhaps I should take it one step at a time and learn to use a dagger first.
::;(Obtain [[Slingshot]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Vasco:''' Let me rethink that...
