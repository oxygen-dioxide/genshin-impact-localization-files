==Description==
"This is a story from Valuka..."

This is a story from many moons ago, when the jungle was still a shining desert of gold, and we had not yet been born from the pomegranates.

There were once three friends. They were as good a group of friends as [[Araji]], [[Aramaha]], and [[Arayama]].<br />
But [[Goddess of Flowers|one of the friends]] returned to the earth, while the remaining two went their separate ways.<br />
[[Scarlet King|One]] was determined to create a kingdom on earth and cause all sorrow to disappear,<br />
While [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|the other]] decided to spread vegetation and greenery and fill the land with wisdom and happiness.

But eventually, kingdoms will fall, wisdom will be distorted, and the definition of happiness will change.<br />
You will forget your dreams, while we will recoil back to ours, forgetting the sun and moon.

Even so, in the depths of the desert, just as the kings of the forest leave footprints behind, and you and I leave stories behind,<br />
The traces of our past friendship are said to slumber quietly, like an [[Aranara]] that has transformed into a seed.
