==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Nora is usually alone playing by the [[Anemo Archon Statue|Anemo God statue]] because Patton, her father, is too busy working at the [[Angel's Share]] tavern. She does not mention her mother, so it can be assumed her mother is either not present or has passed away. Sister [[Grace]], who prays by the Anemo God statue, takes care of her instead.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sorry, Timmie!}}</ref>

In [[Venti]]'s [[Story Quest]], "[[Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land]]", Nora is seen playing with her imaginary friend.

===Appearance===
Nora is a small girl with pale white skin of Caucasian ethnicity. She has light brown hair tied back into two twin braids at the back of her head. Her eyes are turquoise or blue-green in color. She wears a blue short-sleeved pleated Victorian-style dress bare-legged with white ankle-length socks and brown Mary-Jane shoes.
