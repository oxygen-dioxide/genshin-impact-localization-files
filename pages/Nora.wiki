==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Nora is usually alone playing by the Anemo God statue because Patton, her father, is too busy working at the [[Angel's Share]] tavern. She does not mention her mother, so it can be assumed her mother is either not present or has passed away; Sister [[Grace]], who prays by the Anemo God statue, takes care of her instead.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sorry, Timmie!}}</ref>

In [[Venti]]'s [[Story Quest]], "[[Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land]]", Nora is seen playing with her imaginary friend.
