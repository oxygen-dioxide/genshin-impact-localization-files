{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Boucicaut:''' Do you need something, dear customer? Say the word, and I shall procure it through my connections &mdash; anything you wish.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Let me see your wares.
::'''Boucicaut:''' Of course, of course &mdash; worry not, everything you might need can be found here.
:{{DIcon}} Do you know a lot of people?
::'''Boucicaut:''' Indeed, and not merely people from Fontaine, no &mdash; I have many friends from abroad.
::'''Boucicaut:''' I've been a traveling merchant since I was young, but as my journey wore on, I felt that spending my days peacefully at home suited me better.
:{{DIcon}} What connections have you got?
::'''Boucicaut:''' Well now, if I did tell you, I'd have another competitor in this world, now wouldn't I?
::'''Boucicaut:''' Anyway, I know a friend or two in almost any corner.
::'''Boucicaut:''' But don't worry, every nook is safe, and none of them are the Fortress of Meropide. A peaceful life is what I desire, not one afoul of the law.
:{{DIcon}} I'll pass for now.
::'''Boucicaut:''' Alright, but I do hope that this will become your one-stop-shop someday.
