==Profile==
Kujou Kamaji is a member of the [[Kujou Clan]] and an official of the [[Tenryou Commission]]. He is the son of [[Kujou Takayuki]], the Tenryou Commissioner. He is also the younger brother of [[Kujou Masahito]] and the adoptive brother of [[Kujou Sara]]. He is in charge of the Tenryou Commission's government business in Inazuma City. He has doubts about the Shogun's new policies, but there is no one he can talk to about it, so he keeps them to himself and carries on with his duties. In contrast to his father, Kamaji's relationship with Sara is amicable, despite her status as an adopted child.

Following the events of [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], Kamaji takes on his father's position as acting clan head, as both Masahito and Sara continue to lead the Shogunate forces.

==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Reflections of Mortality]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Are you... Ah, you are the Traveler from afar. I almost mistook you for my brother's messenger, what with you "looking for me" and all.
:'''Kujou Kamaji:''' So, what business do you have with me?
:{{DIcon}} About Miss Chisato...
:;(After completing [[Chisato's Letter]])
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Thanks to you, we can finally write to each other now. I really appreciate your help.
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Hmm... I don't know if she likes the snacks I made for her... If possible, I'd really like to meet her myself.
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' There are still so many things left for me to do. For our clan... and my own future.
:{{DIcon}} Your brother?
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Yes, [[Kujou Masahito|Masahito]] is my elder brother. He is in charge of military affairs in Kannazuka. I'm in charge of government business here in Inazuma City.
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' While I was at work, I have been thinking about some issues with our recent policies. However, I can't really tell some of these thoughts to my [[Kujou Takayuki|father]], the head of the Kujou Clan.
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' When my brother was around before, I could still discuss such matters with him. Now that he is stranded on another island, I guess I can only stew in my own doubt...
::{{DIcon}} About Inazuma's policies...
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' I am a member of the Kujou Clan and one of the officials of the Tenryou Commission. It's obvious that I should wholeheartedly support the decision of our Almighty Shogun, but...
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' I've seen the difficult lives led by our people nowadays from the reports I've received recently. The Sakoku Decree and Vision Hunt Decree... are they really beneficial to our future?
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' If the people aren't living happy lives, what's the point of living in an eternal state?
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Perhaps I'm just overthinking and worrying too much...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Until next time.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Reflections of Mortality]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Ah, Traveler, it's you.
:'''Kujou Kamaji:''' I remember how you showed up together with Her Excellency to save me from my predicament, and gave me a chance to stand up on my clan's behalf.
:'''Kujou Kamaji:''' You have my thanks on that account.
:{{DIcon}} How's the situation in the Kujou Clan?
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Things are quite unstable. I've been made Provisional Clan Head, and I'm working to stem the tide of chaos. Still, it all feels like too much for someone like me at times.
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' But since the Almighty Shogun has recognized my will, I cannot disappoint her. I will shoulder our clan's burden.
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Even though our paths did diverge previously, I believe that neither my father nor my brother would be content to have our clan remain in this state.
::{{DIcon}} How is your father doing?
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' To be honest, I still don't quite understand what my father was thinking, nor did I ever feel that what he did was right.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Father... seems to have taken the conclusion of the previous incident very hard. It seems like he aged several decades overnight &mdash; you can barely see any of the conviction and glory he had while leading the clan now.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' But things are different now. Perhaps it's time for the young, like us, to mend the mistakes of our forebears and open a new path for the clan.
::{{DIcon}} How's your older brother?
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' By tradition, the position of heir should belong to my brother, Masahito.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' I recently exchanged letters with my brother, who is currently at his military post in Kannazuka. I thought he might be angered that I took the post of my own accord... but as it turned out, he was very supportive of me.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' He even said that I was more suited to managing the clan, and that he would support me in his role as a warrior in the Shogun's army.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' With his support, I have more faith that we will be able to start over. This will be a difficult road, but I believe that I can help turn things around.
:{{DIcon}} About Miss Chisato...
:;(Before [[The Firmiana Leaf Falls]])
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Thanks to you, we can finally write to each other now. I really appreciate your help.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Hmm... I don't know if she likes the snacks I made for her... If possible, I'd really like to meet her myself.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' There are still so many things left for me to do. For our clan... and my own future.
:;(After The Firmiana Leaf Falls)
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Thank you so much for your help. This should have been a private matter, but I guess we ended up needing your help on multiple occasions.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Seeing her be so strong fills me with joy. I wish I could give her more support, but I don't want to sway her independent judgment.
:::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' As such, I've decided to give her some space and wait for her from a distance. Given her talents, I'm sure she'll do even better than me.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} I hope all goes well with you.
::::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Thank you for your blessing. To be honest, I've learned much from you as well.
::::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' This is just a small gift from me. Please, do accept it.
:::;(Obtain a {{Item|Guide to Transience}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kujou Kamaji:''' Yes, see you again.
