===Notes Someone Left Behind (I)===
Located on the southwestern floating island.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...Know this, brethren...
:&nbsp;
:...Not once has the Sage ever cared about humanity's survival. For the sake of the path of "evolution," the Sage was even willing to sacrifice the future of its own kind...
:...Heaven cares not about the wills of those who dwell in this world. We are viewed as pillars that bear up the earth, necessary for the struggle against its personal foes...
:&nbsp;
:...And so, we may rely on neither the wisdom of [[dragon]]s nor the [[Lord of the Night]]'s might, nor may we pray to any god other than the one and only [[Pyro Archon]]...
:&nbsp;
:...
:&nbsp;
:...The only road left to us is the path of [[Xbalanque]]...
:&nbsp;
:[Phlogiston inscriptions that could not be seen previously emerge.]
:(Mine foolish heir, O you who assert such narrow opinions of species. "Evolution" is a mingled thing, not pure and untainted as you have imagined. That is precisely why "evolution" opposes "eternity.")

:...Remember this, brethren...
:&nbsp;
:...Humanity is the apex life form, the final destination of all things that live in this world...
:&nbsp;
:...The [[vishap]]s of the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|Great Volcano]] once held themselves masters of evolution, but they lost their wisdom in their lengthy, chaotic adaptations, and with it, their power, becoming but beasts to be slaughtered by humans...
:&nbsp;
:...The devolution of the [[Pyro Vishap]]s proves that dragon-kind has been abandoned by the evolutionary path. Their heirs have lost the primal flame's purity, and the [[Xiuhcoatl|sovereign of fire]] shall never again be born from amongst them...
:&nbsp;
:...
:&nbsp;
:...Under his guidance, humanity came to rule the land, and one day, we shall conquer the heavens also. Thus, be not bound by the [[Night Kingdom|realm of Night]]...
:&nbsp;
:...Those upon whom have been bestowed the fortune of boarding this ship, go ye forth! Take the first step toward the realization of our great cause...
:&nbsp;
:[Phlogiston inscriptions that could not be seen previously emerge.]
:(Were it not for the arbitrary divine punishment that divided my race and cut off their evolutionary paths, why would I have needed to seek new possibilities in humanity? Oh humanity, you who were created, you will never understand, for you are but one stage in this "evolution.")

===Notes Someone Left Behind (III)===
Located on the northeastern floating island.
{{Dialogue Start}} 
:...Understand this, brethren...
:&nbsp;
:...Everything comes at a price, and anything that surpasses human wisdom cannot be relied upon...
:&nbsp;
:...The ancient dragons believed that technology and the [[Flamelord]]'s authority would grant them overlordship for ten thousand years, but through this, they also lost the strength to progress, and eventually lost it all...
:&nbsp;
:...If we rely on heaven's rules, not only shall we be bound by the earth, but we shall in the end become but puppets, strung up on the Lord of the Night's strings...
:&nbsp;
:...Never stop moving forward, or our beloved king and our alliance's glorious cause shall be destroyed in but an instant...
:&nbsp;
:[Phlogiston inscriptions that could not be seen previously emerge.]
:(I saw, in those dark bedeviled skies, the stallions that raced amidst the true stars... and then at last I understood that all empires, no matter how great, will eventually become barriers in the way of living beings and their continued evolution. Only...)

:...You must believe, brethren...
:&nbsp;
:...The great Pyro Archon Xbalanque's light guides us, and our victory is inevitable...
:&nbsp;
:...
:&nbsp;
:...Listen not to the chaotic rumors spread by tale-tellers in the wilderness, and heed neither the words of false gods nor the rebellion of the golden-eyed...
:&nbsp;
:...The only one we should worship is him, for he is the one true king who is of "humanity," the one true "human" god...
:&nbsp;
:...The true god shall never die... Glory eternal...

:[Most of the inscriptions on the stone tablet have been erased, rendering them almost unreadable.]
:&nbsp;
:...The highest... greatest... brightest (...) made a pact with the (...) of the silver dragon. The [[Golden Entreaty|shattered gold seal]] is proof of the oath...
:&nbsp;
:...By that oath did (...) obtain, from the dragons... the authority of "Huitzilopochtli"...
