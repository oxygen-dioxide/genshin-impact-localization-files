==Trivia==
* The Credit Coupons were invented, developed, and set in the Fortress of Meropide by [[Pantalone]], the 9th [[Fatui Harbinger]], as an experiment in his goal to overthrow [[Mora]], Teyvat's god-controlled  global currency, with his own man-made currency.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Cashflow Supervision}}</ref>
