==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''[[Past and Future]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Coyopa:''' The [[Pyro Archon]] seems to have been pretty busy lately. The [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] haven't made any big announcements, have they?
:'''Coa:''' No news on my end. How about you?
:'''Coyopa:''' Uh... If I knew what was going on, why would I be asking you?
:'''Coyopa:''' ...Well, either way, nothing much we can do about it, and there's no point in just standing here. Why don't we go grab a drink instead?
:'''Coa:''' You're not trying to trick me into going to [[Xocolatl Beverages]] again, are you? How about... No.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Past and Future''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Coyopa:''' The Pyro Archon seems to have been pretty busy lately. The Masters of the Night-Wind haven't made any big announcements, have they?
:'''Coa:''' No news on my end.
:'''Coa:''' Come to think of it though, the Pyro Archon seems to have got everyone searching for [[The Captain|a Fatui Harbinger]], and there's talk that [[Ororon|someone]] from the Masters of the Night-Wind might be caught up in it all.
:'''Coyopa:''' Oh? That doesn't sound too good...
:'''Coa:''' *sigh* Things have been a bit too eventful recently for my liking too.
:'''Coa:''' So... How about that drink?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after completing ''[[A Fuel Named "Fate"]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Coyopa:''' [[Tlilhua]], [[Vilca]], [[Ekwensu]]...
:'''Coa:''' [[Kwame]], [[Purum]], [[Inna]]...
:'''Coa:''' Oh and [[Nzinga]] too... Despite being a rookie, she still went without the slightest hint of hesitation...
:'''Coyopa:''' It's reached the point that I'm actually hoping for new announcements from the Masters of the Night-Wind.
:'''Coa:''' We could all use some good news, that's for sure.
:'''Coa:''' But let us not be discouraged! We must not forget the necessity of sacrifice, or the victory we strive for.
:'''Coyopa:''' You're right.
:'''Coypoa:''' If we get some free time... How about we invite the Pyro Archon for a drink?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #4===
''Available after completing ''[[When All Becomes a Monument]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Coyopa:''' Have you got everything sorted?
:'''Coa:''' Of course. I may not much like paperwork, but I'll manage &mdash; through gritted teeth, if I must.
:'''Coyopa:''' Impressive. The losses and casualties from the war, not to mention the resources needed for reconstruction... Just thinking about it makes my head spin.
:'''Coa:''' *sigh* It's all done now. Let these records gather dust in the [[Speaker's Chamber]]. It's time for Natlan to welcome a new dawn.
:'''Coyopa:''' Well said!
:'''Coyopa:''' Although, seeing as everything's over... There's something I've been meaning to ask...
:'''Coa:''' Huh? What is it? Don't be shy.
:'''Coyopa:''' Those... [[False Sky|fragments in the sky]]. What are they?
:'''Coa:''' Oh! You're curious about those? I'd like to know as well.
:'''Coa:''' How about we ask the Pyro Archon the next time we go for a drink?
