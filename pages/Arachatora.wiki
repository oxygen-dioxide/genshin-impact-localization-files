==Profile==
Arachatora and his "family" met the [[Traveler's Sibling]] sometime before the [[cataclysm]], where he and his brothers became interested in cooking after watching them cook. However, they quickly ended up arguing and were kicked out of Vanarana by [[Arapacati]], where they went their separate ways.

Arachatora would end up in [[Vissudha Field]], where he was trying to find a mushroom for the upcoming [[Festival Utsava]] to create the perfect mushroom dish. When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] arrived and found him, he was disoriented, and they used {{Dendro}} to restore him. He revealed that he had been disoriented after trying some bad mushrooms, and upon learning that the festival was coming up, told them that he had found a Head Mushroom, though it was deep in a cave infested by [[The Withering]]. The three went into the cave where the mushroom was found and purified the area, collecting the mushroom.

Returning to his camp, Arachatora cooked the mushroom and served it to the two, though they did not find any taste and was too tough. They told him their opinion, which confused him as when he served it to the Golden Nara, they appeared to have enjoyed it. He did not ask for their input, but simply assumed that because they had swallowed it with vigor and assumed it meant that it was good. Paimon would later salvage his recipe to a more appealing [[Mushroom Hodgepodge]].

Arachatora thanked the Traveler for finishing his training and returned to Vanarana, where he and his brothers were scolded by Arapacati. When the festival began, the Traveler gave them a serving of Radish Veggie Soup. Arachatora did not appear to be critical of the soup as his brothers were, simply wondering if it was what Nara called the "taste of happiness."

==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Available during ''[[An Unwavering Culinary Dream]]'')
:'''Arachatora:''' I'm so happy that I was able to gather the Head Mushroom, complete my cooking training, and get to know a strong and reliable Nara.
:'''Arachatora:''' Arapacati, [[Arasaka]], [[Arapas]], and [[Araphala]] will be grateful too. Nara {{Traveler}}, you're a good Nara.
:{{DIcon}} Grateful? Why?
:'''Arachatora:''' Because by helping me, you've given them a chance to taste the Head Mushroom.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Available after ''An Unwavering Culinary Dream'')
:'''Arachatora:''' Sister is angry, so Arachatora is keeping a piece of "Head Mushroom," till the Sunsettia ripens ten times.
:{{DIcon}} Keeping a piece?
::'''Arachatora:''' Cooking all the "Head Mushroom" for Nara {{Traveler}}, that was the plan. But sister said, no mushroom picking before the Sunsettia ripens another ten times.
::'''Arachatora:''' Without the scent of mushrooms, Arachatora feels bad. Arachatora might sneak out for mushrooms when the Sunsettia ripens only nine times.
::'''Arachatora:''' So Arachatora kept a tiny little piece, thinner than the leaves. It will stay with Arachatora.
::'''Arachatora:''' So embarrassing...
:{{DIcon}} That's a long wait...
::'''Arachatora:''' *whimper*
::'''Arachatora:''' But at that time, maybe "Head Mushroom" in Vana, could grow bigger, and have richer taste.
::'''Arachatora:''' Perhaps... They'll grow into "Super Triple Head Mushroom."
::'''Arachatora:''' Thinking about that, makes Arachatora a little happier.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Arachatora:''' *whimper*
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Available after ''[["Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye"]]'')
:'''Arachatora:''' At Festival Utsava, everyone is happy, Arachatora is even happier. When the Sunsettias ripen once more, I can go to find new mushrooms.
:{{DIcon}} Once more?
::'''Arachatora:''' Yes! Arapacati said the "Head Mushroom" brought happiness to Nara.
::'''Arachatora:''' That's why she's not angry anymore and I don't have to wait until the Sunsettias to ripen many times to pick mushrooms.
::'''Arachatora:''' I must find mushrooms with better flavors. I hope this time Arapacati won't be angry, or Arapacati will definitely have me wait until the Sunsettias have ripened 100 times, or even 100 times of 100 times.
:{{DIcon}} New mushrooms?
::'''Arachatora:''' It's said that, somewhere far, far away, there are mushrooms that have the color of fallen leaves and grow on the feet of pine trees.
::'''Arachatora:''' There's another kind of mushrooms. They are as blue as the sky. They glitter at moonrise.
::'''Arachatora:''' That mushroom and the "Head Mushroom," which tastes better?
::'''Arachatora:''' For this "special cooking training," I want to find those mushrooms, and use them to cook the supreme delicacy for Nara {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} Good luck!
::'''Arachatora:''' I will find mushrooms with richer flavors! Nara {{Traveler}} must come and enjoy the food together by then!
