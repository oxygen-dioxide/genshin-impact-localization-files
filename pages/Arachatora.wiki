==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''(Available during [[An Unwavering Culinary Dream]])''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arachatora''': I'm so happy that I was able to gather the Head Mushroom, complete my cooking training, and get to know a strong and reliable Nara.
:'''Arachatora''': [[Arapacati]], [[Arasaka]], [[Arapas]], and [[Araphala]] will be grateful too. Nara (Traveler), you're a good Nara.
:{{DIcon}} Grateful? Why?
:'''Arachatora''': Because by helping me, you've given them a chance to taste the Head Mushroom.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''(Available after [[An Unwavering Culinary Dream]])''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arachatora:''' Sister is angry, so Arachatora is keeping a piece of "Head Mushroom," till the Sunsettia ripens ten times.
:{{DIcon}} Keeping a piece?
::'''Arachatora:''' Cooking all the "Head Mushroom" for Nara (Traveler), that was the plan. But sister said, no mushroom picking before the Sunsettia ripens another ten times.
::'''Arachatora:''' Without the scent of mushrooms, Arachatora feels bad. Arachatora might sneak out for mushrooms when the Sunsettia ripens only nine times.
::'''Arachatora:''' So Arachatora kept a tiny little piece, thinner than the leaves. It will stay with Arachatora.
::'''Arachatora:''' So embarrassing...
:{{DIcon}} That's a long wait...
::'''Arachatora:''' *whimper*
::'''Arachatora:''' But at that time, maybe "Head Mushroom" in Vana, could grow bigger, and have richer taste.
::'''Arachatora:''' Perhaps... They'll grow into "Super Triple Head Mushroom."
::'''Arachatora:''' Thinking about that, makes Arachatora a little happier.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Arachatora:''' *whimper*
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''(Available after ???)''{{Verify}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arachatora:''' At Festival Utsava, everyone is happy, Arachatora is even happier. When the Sunsettias ripen once more, I can go to find new mushrooms.
:{{DIcon}} Once more?
::'''Arachatora:''' Yes! Arapacati said the "Head Mushroom" brought happiness to Nara.
::'''Arachatora:''' That's why she's not angry anymore and I don't have to wait until the Sunsettias to ripen many times to pick mushrooms.
::'''Arachatora:''' I must find mushrooms with better flavors. I hope this time Arapacati won't be angry, or Arapacati will definitely have me wait until the Sunsettias have ripened 100 times, or even 100 times of 100 times.
:{{DIcon}} New mushrooms?
::'''Arachatora:''' It's said that, somewhere far, far away, there are mushrooms that have the color of fallen leaves and grow on the feet of pine trees.
::'''Arachatora:''' There's another kind of mushrooms. They are as blue as the sky. They glitter at moonrise.
::'''Arachatora:''' That mushroom and the "Head Mushroom," which tastes better?
::'''Arachatora:''' For this "special cooking training," I want to find those mushrooms, and use them to cook the supreme delicacy for Nara (Traveler).
:{{DIcon}} Good luck!
::'''Arachatora:''' I will find mushrooms with richer flavors! Nara (Traveler) must come and enjoy the food together by then!
