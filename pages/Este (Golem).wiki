==Profile==
Este was born in [[Remuria]], serving the kingdom faithfully, gaining the title of 'Este the Quick-Witted' during his lifetime. Despite [[Remus]]' slumber, Este would not stray from the path of his Sebastos, actively trying to remind others of the God-King's teachings. However, when the kingdom fell, he would follow [[Cassiodor]] to [[Fontaine]] and start a family there.

Este's spirit &mdash; brought back by the [[Symphony]] &mdash; would eventually inhabit a [[Praetorian Golem]] as opposed to a resident of [[Petrichor]], due to his [[Este (Human)|descendant of the same name]] being present in the town.

===Appearance===
Este &mdash; due to the existence of his [[Este (Human)|descendant]] during the events of ''[[Canticles of Harmony]]'' &mdash; is forced to inhabit a [[Praetorian Golem]], lacking the orange in his helmet.

His appearance in life is unknown.
