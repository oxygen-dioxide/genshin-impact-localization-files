'''Slimes''' are [[Common Enemies]] found all around [[Teyvat]].

In combat, they act like almost all other Elemental Lifeforms, being immune to a specific element that is also applied to them at all times. Some slimes are larger and stronger than normal.

==Types==
===Small Slimes===
Small Slimes primarily attack by bumping into the player.

Slimes are [[Elemental Lifeforms]]. They are created from condensed elemental energy that descended into slimes. Slimes need elemental energy in order to survive and cannot resist elemental bait regardless of the element they're affiliated with.

Slimes are usually found with their corresponding surroundings. Some slimes can be found with [[hilichurls]] and used for various purposes, from making explosives to preserving food to acting as batteries.

==Trivia==
* Slimes need to extract elemental energy to survive. Because of this, substances like [[Mist Flower]] extract are irresistible to them.
** During [[Darknight Hero's Alibi (Quest)|Darknight Hero's Alibi]], [[Connor]] from the [[Dawn Winery]] creates Elemental Bait with Mist Flower extract for the [[Traveler]] to use and lure slimes. The Traveler uses it again during [[Astrology and the 50-Year Pact]].
* It seems that the Hilichurls are resourceful enough to utilize the Slimes for their own use:
** Large Anemo Slimes can be used to operate Air Balloons to transport cargo.
*** The hot air balloon in [[Safe Conduct]] took inspiration on its design. The air lift in [[Invitation of Windblume/Festive Challenges|Floral Freefall]] uses the same hot air balloon design as well.
** [[Mitachurls]] often use Slimes in battle. They will dig up the ground and throw Slimes at the player. The Wooden Shieldwall Mitachurl is capable of creating a wooden shield with Dendro Slimes while the Blazing Axe and Crackling Axe Mitachurls can sear their axes with Pyro or Electro Slimes respectively and then throw them at the player.
*** [[Lawachurls]] go a step further and dig up and hurl the larger variants of the slimes at the player. They will hurl regular slimes instead if they do not have their elemental armor.
** [[Hilichurl Rogues]], depending on the type, either use Anemo Slimes to float in the air to attack, or Hydro Slimes to launch projectiles before throwing them at the player.
** Some Hilichurls are able to manufacture [[explosive barrels]] with slimes.
*** Currently, all elemental types are found other than [[Anemo]].
** The [[Cryo Hilichurl Grenadiers]] use Cryo Slimes in preserving the freshness of foods.
* As seen above and in both the Archive description and in certain domains (namely, the Ruin Guard Factory), Electro Slimes are used as power source.
* While slimes are found all over Teyvat, Anemo and Dendro Slimes are mysteriously absent in Inazuma's islands. However:
** Large Anemo Slimes are encountered as part of the [[Full Speed Ahead]] and [[The Thundering Wilds]] [[Commissions]] at [[Watatsumi Island]] and at some [[Ley Line Outcrops]].
** Dendro Slimes appear in [[Enkanomiya]], although it is considered separate from the rest of Inazuma.
* During the [https://tot.wiki/wiki/Dreams_of_Childhood_Event Dreams of Childhood Event] in ''Tears of Themis'', the player can visit HoYoLand theme park, several mascots include: [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Homu Family|Homus]] from ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' and Slimes.
