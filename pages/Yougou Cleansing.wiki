'''''Yougou Cleansing''''' is a [[World Quest]] in [[Inazuma]]. It is the final part of the [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] series.

The Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is not yet complete. Cleanse the Sacred Sakura Tree at [[Mt. Yougou]].

==Steps==
# Report back to [[Hanachirusato]]
# Head to the opening at [[Mt. Yougou: The Depths]] and talk to Hanachirusato
# Jump in
# Defeat [["Miasmic Tumor"|Miasmic Tumor]]
#* Summon [[Electrograna|Electrogranum]] from [[Thunder Sakura Bough]] to protect yourself from the [[Balethunder]] in the area.
## Defeat the Cankered Flame [[Ochimusha]].
## After defeating it, a symbol will appear. Pray at the first lantern, directly south of the tumor and the symbol. Adjust the other lanterns in a clockwise order to 4, 5, 3, and 2.''<br />(See [[#Notes|below]] for the solution image.)''
## The Miasmic Tumor will fall down and become damageable.
## After losing around 33% of its health, the tumor will recover and summon an Ensorcelled Thunder Ochimusha. The tumor will begin attacking players. Defeat Ochimusha.
## Another symbol will appear. Pray at the first lantern. Adjust the other lanterns in a clockwise order to 2, 3, 5, and 4.''<br />(See [[#Notes|below]] for the solution image.)''
##The tumor will fall down again. It will now launch energy blasts at the player.
## After another 33% of its health, the tumor will recover and summon both types of Ochimusha at the same time. Defeat them both.
## A final symbol will appear. Pray at the first lantern. Adjust the other lanterns in a clockwise order to 2, 3, 3, and 2.''<br />(See [[#Notes|below]] for the solution image.)''
## The tumor will fall down again. Destroy the tumor.
#* It is possible to skip a puzzle if sufficiently high enough burst damage is dealt, as there is no HP gating (e.g., unlike [[Beneath the Dragon-Queller|Azhdaha]]).
# Talk to Hanachirusato
# Pick up [[Mask of Memories|the mask]]

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing this quest grants the ''[[Inazuma: The Islands of Thunder and Eternity - Series I]]'' achievement ''[[Spring Cleaning]]''.

{{Quest Description|The five barriers have been broken and the evil within has been purged. Time to report back to Hanachirusato at the Thunder Sakura root beneath the well in Konda Village.}}
;(Report back to Hanachirusato)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Miss Masked Maiden, we're back!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' You did a wonderful job. I can hear the Thunder Sakura root singing your praises.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...I have something to confess to you.
:{{DIcon}} Go ahead, tell us.
:'''Paimon:''' What is it?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' When you first acquired the Konda Village ward, I said that you were the "Destined One." In truth, I didn't have full confidence in your virtue and courage at that time.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But as the Cleansing Ritual progressed, you not only showed me my folly, but you also far exceeded my expectations... so much so that...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...I can't help but feel sad. If there had been someone like you by the [[Kitsune Saiguu]]'s side, then perhaps...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps...?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' N&mdash;Nothing. I was just rambling.
:'''Paimon:''' So that's a wrap, then. What's our reward?
:{{DIcon}} Indeed. What will it be?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Well, before that, there's one more thing left to be done.
:{{DIcon}} This isn't over yet, is it?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' No, it isn't. As expected of the one who could easily lift the five barriers. You have the ability to see through things like the moonlight pierces the clouds.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual has one more step to go.
:'''Paimon:''' What? There's another step?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' As a price for protecting the land and absorbing the filth, miasma will accumulate in the roots. You have lifted the barriers and defeated the demons created by these defilements.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Just as the Grand Shrine has its branches, the Thunder Sakura are just the side branches of the Sacred Sakura in Mt. Yougou. The five roots are the main parts.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Most of the filth they absorb has in fact been transmitted to the Sacred Sakura, deep within Mt. Yougou.
:{{DIcon}} So the most important thing is to...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That's right. The key to the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is the last step, which is to lift the barrier over the Sacred Sakura and purify the miasma that has accumulated in its roots over the years.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a minute! The Sacred Sakura is at the Grand Narukami Shrine, right? If we tangle with those monsters right in the middle of the Shrine, it would cause an uproar!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Hehe, there's no need to worry about that.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The Sacred Sakura's roots are sealed in the depths of Mt. Yougou, far away from the Shrine.
:'''Paimon:''' Will there really be no problems?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Yes. You can trust me.
:'''Paimon:''' If you say so. Guess we'll just have to do it!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Thank you. Then let's get this over with as quickly as possible.
----
{{Quest Description|update|The Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is not yet complete. Meet Hanachirusato at Mt. Yougou, and see your duty completed.}}
;(Head to the opening at Mt. Yougou<nowiki>:</nowiki> The Depths and talk to Hanachirusato)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' This is the final barrier of the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' If the two of you are ready...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait! Before we start, Paimon has some questions.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Feel free to ask.
:'''Paimon:''' You said that when the time comes, you would tell us everything.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Yes. But if possible, could we wait until the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is complete?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The Sacred Sakura is constantly telling me of her agony...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Still, I know it is rude to ask that you wait yet more... After all, you two have already done so much.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I'm really sorry. I hope you understand...
:{{DIcon}} Fine.
:{{DIcon}} I trust you.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm. All right, but be sure to keep your word!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Hehe, of course. Thank you both for your understanding.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Well, I'm going to lift the barrier...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "East to the ocean depths, west to the cinder sea, south to the blazing light, and north to the waning waters..."
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "All branches and roots, end this evil!"
;(A small cutscene plays &mdash; the seal is lifted and the electrified pool is drained)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The seal has been lifted.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, what's next?
:{{DIcon}} This is a long descent...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Please forgive me, but...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' You will need to jump in next.
:{{DIcon}} I&mdash;I don't think that's going to work out well for me...
:{{DIcon}} P&mdash;Paimon can fly...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! What are you suggesting?
:'''Paimon:''' It looks so scary down there... Paimon just knows something bad's gonna happen once we jump down.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Don't worry. Though the Sacred Sakura's roots may brim over with filth, she can still tell the one performing the Cleansing Ritual apart from other things.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' She will bless you with a safe landing to cleanse the last of the miasma. This I promise.
:'''Paimon:''' Really?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Please, trust me.
:'''Paimon:''' So what do we do after we get down there?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' To put it shortly, just show your courage.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The filth has condensed into a large tumor in the deepest part of Mt. Yougou, and it is now tightly wrapped and suppressed by the roots of the Sacred Sakura.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Attack the miasmic tumor. It will struggle when it is attacked, and may create demonic creatures to stop you.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' During this time, you will need to use the surrounding mechanisms to strengthen the suppressive force of the Sacred Sakura roots, just as you did with the five seals previously.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The Sacred Sakura will thus be empowered to coordinate with you and create opportunities for you to attack.
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds really scary...
:{{DIcon}} Well, I've fought worse.
:{{DIcon}} So scary!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I believe in your strength. Now then...
:{{DIcon}} Won't you be coming along?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' When the battle is done, I will meet you down there to finish the Cleansing Ritual.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I'm really sorry. As I said, I am prevented from completing this task by my... physical condition.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I hope you will understand...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon guesses this is it...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' So... How are your preparations going?
:{{DIcon}} I am ready.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Okay. Please step forward, then, and perform the final step of the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual...
:{{DIcon}} I'm not ready yet.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Okay... The barrier that imprisoned the filth has been lifted, so I hope that you can complete the Ritual as soon as possible.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' If there is anything you want to ask about the purification, please feel free to ask me.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Well then... I wish you all the best.

;(Talk to Hanachirusato again)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Do you have any questions about the purification?
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me what I need to do again?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' When you reach the bottom, you should see a tumor that has been tightly wrapped and suppressed by the roots. It is a clump of filth that has accumulated over the years. Just try to destroy it.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' It will create demonic creatures to obstruct you when it is attacked. But I don't think that they will be a problem for you.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' During this time, you will need to use the surrounding mechanisms to strengthen the suppressive force of the Sacred Sakura roots, just as you did with the five seals previously.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' The Sacred Sakura will thus be empowered to coordinate with you and create opportunities for you to attack.
:{{DIcon}} What is a "tumor," really?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Simply put, it is a collection of filth that has accumulated throughout the land.
::{{DIcon}} Like the Fatui?
:::'''Hanachirusato:''' The Fatui...?
:::'''Hanachirusato:''' I fear that I have little knowledge of what you speak of, but I doubt that they are defilements of that sort.
::{{DIcon}} Like the Abyss Order?
:::'''Hanachirusato:''' The Abyss...
:::'''Hanachirusato:''' I don't know much about the thing you just said, but it does indeed sound like something dark and foul.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' There has always been sickness, pain, and evil in this land. It is hard to imagine, but one day, a war may...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' ...Happen, and it will bring yet more sickness, pain, and evil to this land. The filth that comes with those things will accumulate and cause harm to the earth. Everything will deteriorate.
::{{DIcon}} (It seems that she doesn't know...)
::'''Hanachirusato:''' If we allow this accumulation of filth to continue, countless diseases, evil spirits, and monsters will run amok... I can hardly bear to countenance it, so please permit me to stop here.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' I have heard that there are different practices in different places in order to remove such defilement. For example, Liyue has its [[adepti]], thaumaturges, and the like.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' It is for this purpose that the Thunder Sakura roots exert their cleansing power to absorb the filth, some of which will converge at the bottom of Mt. Yougou through those roots.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Over the years, a tumor will be formed. The goal of the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is to remove that tumor.
:{{DIcon}} Got it. I'll get going now.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Alright. If there is anything you want to ask about the purification, please feel free to ask me.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' This is the final step. I wish you all the best.
----
{{Quest Description|update|The Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is not yet complete. You must now go to Mt. Yougou: The Depths and clear out the tumor made of condensed miasma.}}
;(Jump in)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like we've had a pretty soft landing... To think we'd have to fight such a huge tumor...
:'''Paimon:''' But there's still a battle waiting for us! (Traveler), get them!
;(Start fighting the "Miasmic Tumor")
:'''Paimon:''' You can do it, (Traveler)!
;(When the tumor reaches half-health)
:'''Paimon:''' Doesn't look like the tumor can take much more! Keep going!
;(When the tumor reaches 1/4 of its health)
:'''Paimon:''' Keep it up, (Traveler)! It's almost over...
;(Defeat Miasmic Tumor)
----
{{Quest Description|update|The Miasmic Tumor has been defeated, and Hanachirusato has come to the bottom of Mt. Yougou. Now's the moment for her to speak of her origins, as you agreed earlier.}}
;(Talk to Hanachirusato)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' It is over.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The agony that the Sacred Sakura has been going through should have dissipated...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Human child... you have done well. You truly are the "Destined One."
:'''Paimon:''' Phew, what a tough battle! It's a good thing Paimon has been training you well, (Traveler).
:{{DIcon}} Thank you kindly, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Aw, come on, there's no need to thank Paimon so formally.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I will leave your payment for you later, as we agreed. You shall not have to worry about that...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Didn't we agree on something else, too?
:'''Paimon:''' After the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is completed, you're supposed to tell us your story.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But...
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to hear your tale, too.
:{{DIcon}} We've had a pretty hard time, you know.
:{{DIcon}} We've been through a lot together.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right. You can't go back on your agreement with us now!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' All right.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Before that, there is one thing that I am really sorry about. I haven't had a chance to formally ask you both your names after all this time...
:{{DIcon}} My name is (Traveler).
:'''Paimon:''' And Paimon's name is Paimon!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' (Traveler), Paimon... nice names. I'll keep them in mind.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' As I said earlier, I did inherit the memories of the Kitsune Saiguu.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon's super curious about this part!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The Kitsune Saiguu was originally of the [[Hakushin Clan|Hakushin bloodline]], and she used to defend the people of Inazuma alongside the [[Ei|Electro Archon]].
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I don't know how long ago it was, but in the end, she was consumed by the dark disaster while fighting to protect [[Narukami Island]].
:'''Hanachirusato:''' However, the barriers that she set up in many places protected a great many people. Even though I just happen to have inherited her memory &mdash; and perhaps I overstep my bounds in saying so &mdash; but I'm truly proud of her.
:{{DIcon}} Are you one of her familiars?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, like the Sky and Earth Kitsune?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Now that you mention it, I did notice a very similar kitsune aura at the top of the mountain, within the Grand Narukami Shrine...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But that's not the case with me. I am not one of her familiars, but rather...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' When the dark disaster that consumed her was finally dealt with, her thoughts and memories returned to the soil of Narukami Island.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Now, you defeated many Ochimusha during the process of performing the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual, did you not?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... You mean those ghostly samurai?
:{{DIcon}} They were pretty small beans.
:{{DIcon}} They were pretty scary.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' They are creatures created by the coalescence of filth. Their forms are often swayed by the thoughts and memories of the times.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' If you don't mind, please answer this question honestly: Is Inazuma presently shrouded in war?
:'''Paimon:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' (...What do we do, (Traveler)?)
:{{DIcon}} (Let's tell her the truth.)
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid that it's true.
:'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That seems to be the case!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I see. So it is as I feared.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' When you told me that Ochimusha appeared during the purification of Thunder Sakura root, I already sensed this. Well, as long as she is on the path she believes in...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...Back to the point. I... I, "Hanachirusato," am filth condensed from the memory of Kitsune Saiguu.
:'''Paimon:''' How could that be...
:{{DIcon}} I suspected as much.
:{{DIcon}} I see...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I'm sorry that I couldn't fight along with you. I am unable to purify the filth... because I was created from it myself.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Her memories were so powerful that the dark disaster could not dissolve them completely. After the disaster was defeated, those memories flowed into the earth as fiery filth.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That's how I was born.
:{{DIcon}} You said earlier that if only the Kitsune Saiguu had me around...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Yes. I said that.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' If only the Kitsune Saiguu had someone like you at her side, perhaps she would have survived.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' How wonderful it would be if she had had the chance to meet you.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But when I think about that, I can't help but selfishly think that...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "If that had been the case, then I wouldn't have been born. I wouldn't have inherited her memories, nor would I have met you."
:{{DIcon}} So the "you" that I saw through the [[Memento Lens]]...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Yes, that was me in the past.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' At first, I was quite overwhelmed. But as my memories returned, I came to know where I was from, and I understood my duty.
:{{DIcon}} That means...
:{{DIcon}} Was all that necessary...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Yes.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' My duty is to guard Narukami Island, cleanse the miasma, and finish the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, Miss Masked... No, Miss Hanachirusato. If you're "filth" yourself, and the ritual's goal is to eliminate filth...
:'''Paimon:''' Doesn't that mean you'll be eliminated too?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Well, the word "eliminated" sounds a bit much. But in terms of the result, you are correct.
:'''Paimon:''' No, that can't be...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Heh. When I first realized this, I felt very uneasy as well.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But I've learned a lot about Inazuma through meeting you, and what I've learned relieves me.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' [[Ioroi]] survived and doesn't seem to be depressed at all despite having been sealed in stone by [[Kamuna Harunosuke|Kamuna]]. And... he doesn't seem to have a grudge against the Kitsune Saiguu either..
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Although all is not as well as it once was, the bloodlines of [[Konda]] and [[Saimon]] in Konda Village still run true to this day, which is good. [[Inagi Misato]] of the Grand Shrine was once her friend as well, and that line endures.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' These are the descendants of the people she protected when the disaster struck. She would be proud to know that they are well and that their bloodlines have been passed on.
:'''Hanachirusato:'''  Still... I was little agitated by the destruction of the catalyst that was given to [[Hiiragi Hiroshi]], Kanjou Head, by the [[Kitsune Saiguu]]...
:{{DIcon}} More than a little, I'd say...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Hehe, you are right. I was really bent out of shape about that. Still, I'm glad to see that it came to you, even through such twists and turns...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...I wonder if this is how I feel, or if this is how the Kitsune Saiguu feels.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' In the past, I was often troubled by the fact her mind was mixed with mine &mdash; and yet I was also something she was tasked to remove.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But now... I am relieved.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' It was a pleasure and an honor to travel with you.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' No, rather, it was because of you that I was able to come here and carry out my final duties.
:'''Paimon:''' Are you really leaving?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Yes. Thank you for everything, Paimon.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Please forgive me for overstepping... (Traveler), Paimon, please hear what I have to say.
:{{DIcon}} I'm listening.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "Do not be blinded. Do not waver. Keep walking the path that you believe in."
:'''Hanachirusato:''' These were the Kitsune Saiguu's last words before her final parting.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I'm not qualified to claim the Hakushin bloodline for my own. But I believe that if the Kitsune Saiguu were alive, she would give you her blessing.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I hope that her words&mdash; I mean, my words&mdash; will be able to ward off at least some of the lies and evil that you shall face in the future.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Hehe. You are welcome.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' In exchange... please indulge me one final time.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The Kitsune Saiguu always favored the beauty of short chants. Although I have inherited her memories and the 1,111 chants she knew, I lack the grace she possessed with them.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But this moment reminds me of one such chant...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "When shall we meet again after this parting? For life is like the morning dew."
:{{DIcon}} Miss Hanachirusato...
:{{DIcon}} Farewell.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Thank you, and goodbye. It was a pleasure to meet you both... (Traveler), Paimon.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "All branches and roots, end this evil!"
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "...And I declare it purified hereby."

==Trivia==
*Before [[Hanachirusato]]'s farewell, she recites the following ''{{w|waka}}'': "When shall we meet again after this parting? For life is like the morning dew." {{Lang|ja=別れの日、朝露のよう、いつかまた。}} This is from No. 375 of ''{{w|Kokin Wakashū}}''.
**The English translation follows the literal meaning of Chinese translation: {{Lang|mini=1|zh=与君相别离，不知何日是归期，我如朝露转瞬晞。}}
