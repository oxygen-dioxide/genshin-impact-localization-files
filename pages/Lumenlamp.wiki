'''Lumenlamps''' are special devices in the [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|Underground Mines]] of [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] that can be used to replenish the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]]'s energies.

Lumenlamps are primarily found in the upper human-occupied levels of the Underground Mines, mainly [[Ad-Hoc Main Tunnel]] and [[The Chasm: Main Mining Area]]. They require one bar of Lumenstone Adjuvant energy to activate, and once active, will remain lit until the daily [[Reset]] (with the few exceptions being some permanently pre-lit Lumenlamps at specific camps). They will recharge the Lumenstone Adjuvant to full energy when players stand beside them.

Beyond the [[Stony Halls]], Lumenlamps become rarer and are replaced by luminous versions of the [[Ruin Brazier]] instead, which still performs the same function.
