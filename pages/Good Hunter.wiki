==Trivia==
[[File:KFC Sign.png|thumb|300px|'Chicken Bucket' sign (v1.4)]]
* During a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) / Genshin crossover promotion (March 2021) the billboard sign standing outside the Good Hunter was changed to resemble the KFC styling and color scheme, but in a Genshin'esque style, with a chicken nugget bucket with a picture of a chick on it.
* There is a sign on the wall of the building that reads, using the Teyvat script  (see [[Languages]]): "OPEN", "FINE FOOD", "HOT", and "CHICEN / BEER"
* Good Hunter is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Multi-Seat Round Pine Table]]."
