{{Description|The most popular venue... Fine... The most popular venue, aside from the [[Angel's Share|tavern]], in the whole city is the restaurant. It is always filled with mouthwatering aroma and a great atmosphere. If you can't get your reservations, at least ordering take-out is still an option.|[[Map]] description}}

==Trivia==
[[File:KFC Sign.png|thumb|300px|'Chicken Bucket' sign (v1.4)]]
* During a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) x Genshin crossover promotion (March 2021) the billboard sign standing outside the Good Hunter was changed to resemble the KFC styling and color scheme, but in a Genshin'esque style, with a chicken nugget bucket with a picture of a chick on it.
* Good Hunter is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Multi-Seat Round Pine Table]]."
* Many of the dishes canonically sold by Good Hunter cannot be purchased from Sara in-game.
** [[Sara]] will sometimes say "todays recommendation is the steak" as one of her idle voice lines and claims that Good Hunter is known for its Venison Steak, but the shop itself does not sell steak.
** Sara also says that Good Hunter is known for its Satisfying Salad, but the shop does not sell this either.
** The restaurant's [[Good Hunter's Daily Recommendation|billboard]] advertises their Cold Cut Platter, but they do not sell the recipe nor the dish.
* The {{quest|Food Delivery}} reveals that Good Hunter's take-out service is heavily understaffed due to how popular it is.
* Good Hunter seems to focus on fresh, local ingredients &mdash; they source their meats from hunters in [[Springvale]] and pride themselves in using homegrown Mondstadt apples.<ref name="Sara">{{Ref/NPC|Sara}}</ref>
