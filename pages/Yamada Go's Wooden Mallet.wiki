==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*The Achievement name appears to be a roundabout reference to {{lang|{{W|ja:山本五郎左衛門|Sanmoto Gorouzaemon}}|ja=山本五郎左衛門}}, a youkai from the Edo-period tale {{lang|''Ino Mononoke Roku''|ja=稲生物怪録}} who leads an attempt to scare the tale's protagonist, Ino Heitarou, as part of a wager between himself and another youkai. After he fails to scare Heitarou for 30 days, Sanmoto appears before Heitarou in the form of a samurai and bequeaths a wooden mallet to the boy.
**The more common reading of {{lang|mini=1|ja=山本}} is ''Yamamoto'', which may be the derivation of {{lang|''Yamada''|ja=山田}} in the Achievement despite the fact that the youkai's name is read ''Sanmoto'' instead.
