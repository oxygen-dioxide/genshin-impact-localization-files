{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lastan:''' If only I'd known, I'd have asked someone with more experience to come along with me...
:{{DIcon}} Is something the matter?
::'''Lastan:''' You could say that...
::'''Lastan:''' There's this letter that's really tough to deliver. The recipient is a traveling doctor, so we've got to deliver it while he's here at the tribe.
::'''Lastan:''' I don't know why, but it's almost as if this letter is cursed. It always seems to miss him by a hair...
::'''Lastan:''' I'm new to this whole courier business, and my more experienced colleagues all assured me that "beginner's luck" was a thing, so they persuaded me to give it a go. We even made a bet...
::'''Lastan:''' ...Do you think they were just messing with me?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Maybe there really was no other way.
:::'''Lastan:''' True. They've all tried delivering it themselves, and you saw what happened.
:::'''Lastan:''' Goodness, and I've just started at this job, too... Do you think I can handle it with my limited experience?
::;(Obtain {{Item|Wanderer's Advice|x=6}})
:{{DIcon}} I wish you luck.
::'''Lastan:''' To be honest, I don't really mind, as long as I can get this letter delivered!
