==Occurrence==
While the rolling chance of a specific sub-stat is useful, the probability of occurrence of a that specific sub-stat with respect to the 4 possible sub-stats of an artifact is a more practical application of its [[Artifacts/Distribution|distribution]].

The probabilities show that while gap between the rolling chances of some sub-stats are relatively large, this is compensated by having 4 sub-stat slots, bridging some of the gap between sub-stats that have a low rolling chances. In short, this show the probability of a given an artifact with 4 sub-stats that a specific sub-stat is one of them.

The rate of the most common Crit Rate and Crit Damage pair is also especially shown to highlight the large decrease of probability as more sub-stats out of the 4 are specified.

==Mathematical Treatment==
Consider the collection of substats, <math>S_1,S_2,S_3,...,S_n</math> each with a probability of <math>p_1,p_2,p_3,...,p_n</math>, respectively.
The probability of a specific substat being rolled first is:
:<math>P(S_1) = p_1</math>
The probabability of a specific substat being rolled second given 1 preceding substat is:
:<math>P(S_1,S_2) = p_1 \times \frac{p_2}{1 - p_1}</math>
The probabability of a specific substat being rolled third given 2 preceding substat is:
:<math>P(S_1,S_2,S_3) = p_1 \times \frac{p_2}{1 - p_1} \times \frac{p_3}{1 - p_1 - p_2}</math>
The probabability of a specific substat being rolled fourth given 3 preceding substat is:
:<math>A_{1234}=P(S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4) = p_1 \times \frac{p_2}{1 - p_1} \times \frac{p_3}{1 - p_1 - p_2} \times \frac{p_4}{1 - p_1 - p_2 - p_3}</math>

The <math>P(S_1,S_2,S_3,S_4)</math> or <math>A_{1234}</math> for better notation - is just a set of substats without considering permutation that may occur in an artifact - as such <math>A_{4321}</math> or <math>A_{2143}</math> can occur as well. However, the occurrence rate of substat such as <math>S_1</math>, is the sum of all artifact substat configurations, containing <math>{S_1}</math>, that is:

:<math>P(\text{Occurence } S_1) = \sum \{A| S_1 \in A\}</math>

The calculation of the exact probability is not given in any closed formula or distribution since probabilities change depending on the substat rolled. Simulation and manual computation are possible but given the number of possibilities are <math>k</math> pick <math>4</math>, it may be rigorous however since some substats have the same probabilities, computation time and possibility may be reduced considerably.

As a note for a possible source of confusion, note that: <math>\sum (\text{Occurence } S_n) = 4</math>. This is different from the belief that the sum should be 1 however, given the probability of an artifact configuration, its probability is counted 4 times in each substats' occurrence rate because they all occurred in the same artifact. Consider a simplified  example of artifacts only having 2 substats: AB, AC, CB, and AB. The occurrence are  A is 75% (3/4), B is 75% (3/4), and C is 50% (2/4). The sum of these are 2, which are the number of substat slots.
