===Etymology===
*The Arabic-Persian word {{lang|"dahri"|ar=دَهْرِيّ|ar_rm=dahriyy|fa=دهری|fa_rm=dahrī}}, derived from ''dahr'' (<u>Arabic-Persian</u>: {{lang|mini=1|ar={{wt|دهر|دَهْر|Noun}}}}, "the course of time, fate"), is a theological term which refers to an atheist, or an adherent of the doctrine that the universe has no beginning in time. The term has been used in different ways in Middle Persian and Islamic writings, but generally, ''dahri'' deny the existence of a creator god and believe that the world exists eternally in time.<ref>Encyclopaedia Iranica, [https://iranicaonline.org/articles/dahri-ar Dahrī]</ref> This term is used in the game specifically to refer to [[Khaenri'ah]].
