{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sosi:''' Outlander from afar... speak to the Vijnanapati if you have matters to discuss.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Sosi:''' I'm... Ahem, you need not know that much.
::'''Sosi:''' If there's nothing else, please leave as soon as possible.
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you then.
::'''Sosi:''' Alright. I'll be continuing with my work.

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after beginning ''[[The Splendorous Sky That Day]]''.''{{Verify|This dialogue is (erroneously) available before turning in the Korybantes: Vedana to Katherine.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sosi:''' Lady Sorush's Yasnapati... Don't give up so easily. You should... try harder.
:{{DIcon}} Has something happened?
::'''Sosi:''' Oh, it's nothing. I'm not making much progress in my research, that's all. This is all part and parcel of a researcher's life.
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you then.
::'''Sosi:''' Thank you for your understanding. I'll be continuing with my work then.

===Dialogue Set #3===
''{{cx}}''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sosi:''' ...Oh! It's you, Lady Sorush's Yasnapati. If you have any questions at all, I'll make sure to tell you everything I know.
:{{DIcon}} About the Khvarena Monument...
::'''Sosi:''' As you may have noticed, I haven't given up on investigating the Order of Skeptics' documents.
::'''Sosi:''' Although there had been some discrepancies between the records and the apparent situation...
::'''Sosi:''' I believe that as long as I look closely enough, the truth will emerge sooner or later.
:{{DIcon}} About the Fatui...
::'''Sosi:''' Thanks to you all, Markozov has already withdrawn his troops.
::'''Sosi:''' However, the Fatui would never give up that easily...
::'''Sosi:''' Perhaps it's time for the Order of Skeptics to recruit more capable personnel. At the very least, they should do better than Pyrrho.
:{{DIcon}} About the Order of Skeptics...
::'''Sosi:''' Our Vijnanapati... No, Nasejuna's actions have been despicable. Yet you were still able to extinguish the Sign of Apaosha... Impressive as always, Lady Sorush.
::'''Sosi:''' My only regret is that I couldn't participate in such a historical moment myself...
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you then.
::'''Sosi:''' You're too kind. I'll be continuing with my work then.
