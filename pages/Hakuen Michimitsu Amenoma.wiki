==Lore==
500 years ago, the Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma was forged by the master of the [[Amenoma Smithy]] at the time for [[Iwakura Michihiro]], the founder of the [[Iwakura Clan]]. Since then, it has been passed down to every successor of the clan's ''-in'' title, a suffix that is bestowed to those who have completely mastered the Iwakura Art.

In the present, the Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma fell into the possession of [[Iwakura Mitsunari]], the Master of the Iwakura Clan. However, after the enactment of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], Mitsunari willingly surrendered his [[Vision]], a decision that was fiercely opposed by the other disciples in the clan. Between expulsion and desertion, the members of the Iwakura Clan went their separate ways while Mitsunari joined the Shogunate Army as an instructor.

After learning that the [[Traveler]] had slain five of his former disciples, Mitsunari challenges them to a duel to avenge his clan near the [[Kujou Encampment]], only to lose and die himself. Somehow, the Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma disappeared after the duel, as [[Okazaki Toraemon]] and [[Yanagiha Arashi]] were unable to find it when they built a memorial out of their fallen former comrades' blades. The blade eventually resurfaced in Enkanomiya, though how it ended up so far from [[Kannazuka]] is unknown.

==Trivia==
*The [[Amenoma Kageuchi]] is a copy of this sword, given to the [[Saimon Clan]] by Iwakura Michihiro as thanks for giving him a place to live during his self-imposed isolation from society.
