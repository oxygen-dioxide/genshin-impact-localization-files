'''Venerare''' was the leader of the early generations of the [[Lawrence Clan]] who lived approximately 2600 years ago.<ref group="Note">Venerare knew [[Leonard]], who must have been alive before [[Barbatos]] became the Anemo Archon in order to climb Pilos Peak, but she was also alive post-Barbatos' ascension due to constructing the original statue of Barbatos in the plaza.</ref>

Under her guidance, the original Anemo Archon Statue was built in the plaza of the [[city of Mondstadt]], with an inscription of the oath to defend Mondstadt written beneath. However, after the statue was torn down by her descendants in the [[Timeline#Late Aristocratic Period (1600–1000 years ago)|late Aristocratic Period]], the inscription was lost and can no longer be seen on the rebuilt statue.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Royal Grimoire}}</ref>

She had an as of yet unclear relationship with [[Leonard]], having helped him reach [[Pilos Peak]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Of Mountains and Seas}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The Latin word ''{{wt|venerare||Latin}}'' is a conjugated form of the verb ''{{wt|veneror||Latin}}'', meaning "to worship, adore, revere, or venerate."
