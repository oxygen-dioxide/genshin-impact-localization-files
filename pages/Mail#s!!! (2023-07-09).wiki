|text      = Long time no see. I was planning on sending you something, so I wrote this letter.

I heard you're traveling all over the world. That can't be easy.

I recently bought several new varieties of coffee beans to try out at home. After we compared the taste of each, we decided that this was the best. You'll find a bag of that variety attached to this letter, and I hope it'll raise your spirits in the days ahead.

Life often seems as though it is a tapestry composed of undulating lines, but if it is at all possible, I sincerely hope the lines drafting out your future are stable lines, ascending upwards.

Safe travels.
