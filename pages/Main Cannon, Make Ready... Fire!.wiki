| In the {{Color|help|Main Cannon, Make Ready... Fire!}} challenge, Travelers will be tasked with keeping the sea clear of any monster encampments.<br />The {{Color|help|Waverider's}} two armaments are capable of dealing considerable damage to {{Color|help|light}} floating towers, but cannot damage {{Color|help|heavy}} floating towers. Travelers will need to leave their Waverider to {{Color|help|board}} heavy towers and cross swords with the monsters.

| Some floating enemy structures are shielded by a {{Color|help|Violent Wind Barrier}}, which {{Color|help|prevents Travelers and their Waveriders from approaching}}.<br />These wind barriers are sustained by three Violent Wind Emitters which are controlled by Anemo Samachurls. The wind emitters will revolve around the outside of the wind barrier and can only be destroyed using {{Color|help|heavy cannons}} or {{Color|help|explosive barrels}}. After all three wind emitters are destroyed, the Violent Wind Barrier will dissipate.

| Collect {{Color|help|Pithy Pearls}} to greatly decrease the {{Color|help|cooldown}} of your Heavy Cannon and bring the barriers down faster!

| {{Color|help|Whirlpools}} may appear near enemy encampments.<br />Whirlpools will continuously pull in nearby Waveriders and Travelers. Once caught by the Whirlpool, the Waverider will start taking continuous damage and Travelers' Stamina will be {{Color|help|rapidly consumed}}.<br />If the Waverider is destroyed, Travelers will {{Color|help|automatically be ejected from the Waverider}}, so be wary out there on the high seas!

==Rewards==
{{Quote|The sea's surface is covered with floating towers constructed by monsters.

Time to send these shameless monsters to the ocean floor!}}
