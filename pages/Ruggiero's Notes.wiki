===Ruggiero's Notes (I)===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...

:The [[Cassiodor|Golden Hunter]] knows far more about [[Remuria]] than I expected.

:According to historical records, the [[Marechaussee Phantom|Marechaussee Hunter]]s should have first become active a few decades after the fall of [[Remuria]], by which point the concept of the [[Lochknight]]s had completely died out in Fontaine. No matter the dramatic adaptation, none would put the Marechaussee Hunters, Remuria, and Lochknights together &mdash; For these concepts simply do not belong to the same era. Even a five-year-old child would not commit such a grave error...

:Yet none of what he discussed seemed to have anything to do with the [[Golden Troupe]], but instead was &mdash; indeed, always was &mdash; about ancient Remuria...

:I have a theory that I dare not raise with him directly. Perhaps the Golden Hunter is not the "Devout orphan called and chosen by [[Egeria]]," but is in fact one of the last Remurian remnants. The only problem with this theory is that it cannot explain his immortality...

:I indirectly broached the issues of the Lochknights with him. I couldn't discern his expression, but he seemed reluctant to discuss the topic. Quite surprising. After all, it is commonly said the first Marechaussee Hunters to follow him were the heirs of the Lochknights, such as [[Este (Golem)|Este]] and Walter. Could it be that they were like him...?

:No matter what, according to him, the priority now is to stop (...) awakening from the seals. As for these historical questions, they can be left for a later date...

:Alas, we found no noteworthy Remurian treasures other than (...). Nothing but Mora-a-dozen bric-a-brac from storehouses.

:If what the Golden Hunter said was true, then the (...) we initially sought has long since sunk to the bottom of the sea alongside Capitolium. Most of the relics here are from the Golden Troupe, not...

:Regardless, we have not the time to retrieve the relics now. Our current priority is to seal this place. I've marked the location of the relics on the map, perhaps someday...

===Ruggiero's Notes (III)===

:...

:I already completely understand everything.

:Humanity has no need to &mdash; nor should they &mdash; control any knowledge beyond their abilities. In a way, it is not people who pursue knowledge, but knowledge that pursues people.

:I have an idea. It's one I never mentioned to the Golden Hunter before he left. Why not rebuild the long-abandoned town of [[Petrichor]]? We can attract refugees to live here, and spread other versions of the legend. This way, they will actively protect the rebuilt seals, and the secrets of this place will be forever...
