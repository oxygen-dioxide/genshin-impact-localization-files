You can view match progress and access the main arena via a secret passage near the match noticeboard to duke it out with your next opponent.<br>It is said that upon hearing that this location attracts the largest crowds, the organizers of the Nilotpala Cup put much effort into developing an abandoned Domain nearby and renovating it into the main tournament arena...

| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Floating Hydro Fungus Ace Fungus Icon.png|80px]]<br>[[Bongo-Head]]
| Many people must have already heard of this dynamic duo, the "Golden Comet" Traveler and the "Silver Companion" Paimon!<br>Now, this duo has created an elite team with the Fungus "Bongo-Head" as its core and trump card, and decided to participate in the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament.<br>According to Silver Companion, their goal is to "let everyone enjoy the competition while taking the championship and reward money in the meantime!" Such gallant words are truly worthy of respect! Surely, every Fungus battle this duo participates in will become a timeless classic!

| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Floating Dendro Fungus Ace Fungus Icon.png|80px]]<br>Floating Dendro Fungus<br>"Magishroom"
| Ajilenakh Dash is full of youthful vigor, and in fact came to register with a great many companions in tow, only for all of them save her to be disqualified due to being underage. According to the contestant herself, she fights on behalf of all the children who love Ajilenakh Nuts, and her goal is to win a large sum of Mora in the tournament and give the children who support her a decade's supply (and then some!) of Ajilenakh Nuts.<br>Ajilenakh Dash's Ace Fungus, "Magishroom" is able to use the wondrous Dendro element to complement its teammates and create all manner of Elemental Reactions on the battlefield. One should have no doubt that Ajilenakh Dash herself will want to make the most of these advantages!

| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Stretchy Anemo Fungus Ace Fungus Icon.png|80px]]<br>Stretchy Anemo Fungus<br>"Stormstress"
| Souka hails from Inazuma and is a rising star with Yae Publishing House, the popular light novel publisher. She has joined the competition in hopes of finding inspiration for her new work. Such dedication! Though this contestant's performance in the preliminaries was rather shaky, one can only conclude that she is nonetheless a talented beast tamer, especially when one considers her nature as a guest from afar who has only just encountered Fungi.<br>Souka's ace, "Stormstress," is skilled at using Anemo projectiles to attack from afar, and can also provide its teammates with healing and Anemo buffs. This steady-as-she-goes style of combat should by no means be underestimated!

| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Whirling Cryo Fungus Ace Fungus Icon.png|80px]]<br>Whirling Cryo Fungus<br>"Gusto-Frosto"
| To some adventurers, the name of Baron Bigfoot is a rather famous one indeed, for he is a very senior and experienced member of the Guild who has traveled to Mondstadt and adventured in Dragonspine. Now, he brings what he has learned of the biting cold to this tournament, and has formed a team whose main force is that of Cryo Fungi!<br>Baron Bigfoot's greatest ally is "Gusto-Frosto," who can close the distance with its opponents rapidly and quickly apply Cryo to its opponents. Should the team comprise Hydro Fungi, they might be able to control this entire battlefield!

| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Stretchy Geo Fungus Ace Fungus Icon.png|80px]]<br>Stretchy Geo Fungus<br>"Rocksteady"
| Hardy Two-Blades is the nickname that this retired Eremite mercenary was given due to his great skill in using dual shamshirs. He served many merchants as a caravan guard and passed through many dangerous areas, during which time he would make the acquaintance of many dangerous wild creatures. Now, these experiences are forming the basis of his participation in and progress through the Nilotpala Cup.<br>"Rocksteady" is the name of this contestant's ace-in-the-hole. Few have used this type of Fungus as the core of their teams up till the Round of 16, but in truth, Stretchy Geo Fungi do have great destructive abilities that can allow them to deal great damage to tightly packed teams. Perhaps it is Rocksteady's power that gives Hardy Two-Blades the confidence and skill to command his Fungi team as he would his very own right and left arms.

| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Layla Thumb.png|50px]]<br>[[Layla]]
| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Floating Anemo_Fungus Ace Fungus Icon.png|80px]]<br>Floating Anemo Fungus<br>"[[Twirly-Whirly]]"
| Layla has been a real dark horse in this tournament, and there is little information out there concerning her. What we can be sure of is that she is a student of the Rtawahist Darshan who seems to have both rather excellent grades and the respect of her fellow students. Additionally, her stated goal was to make it to quarterfinals and take the Fungi who caught her eye back with her to be her trusted companions... Of course, since she is in the semifinals, this rather pedestrian wish has already been fulfilled, and she is guaranteed a good sum of Mora as a prize besides!<br>Layla's Ace Fungus is the very agile "Twirly-Whirly" who is both hard to hit and wont to use powerful Anemo explosive shots to suppress its foes. It is also capable of creating a vortex that can pull opponents in a large AoE. However, it seems that few contestants have used Anemo Fungi like Twirly-Whirly as the centerpiece of their teams. Perhaps this is because they look more cutesy than they do tough?
|-
| VI
| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Haniyyah Thumb.png|50px]]<br>[[Haniyyah]]
| [[File:Fabulous Fungus Frenzy Whirling Pyro_Fungus Ace Fungus Icon.png|80px]]<br>Whirling Pyro Fungus<br>"[[Pyro-1]]"
| Haniyyah, the strongest seeded contestant in this tournament, has been a beast tamer for at least a decade. It is said that the Sumpter Beasts trained by her are especially good-natured and intelligent, with many such beasts that carry heavy burdens having passed from her hands to those of merchants. Many ordinary people also seek her help in improving their relationship with their pets, with rather stellar results each time. It is no exaggeration to say that Haniyyah is one of the greatest beast tamers around, and if she had a mind to promote herself, she would already be very famous indeed.<br>Haniyyah's trump card, "Pyro-1," is also evidence of her great taming skills, for it belongs to a species of Fungi with the greatest offensive capabilities out of all their kind. Even its simplest attacks can damage multiple opponents in an area, and when it goes all-out, it can suck its opponents toward itself before using an explosion to dishing out some serious damage. However, with this great power has also come an explosive temper, which is why few ever place Whirling Pyro Fungi into their teams, let alone have them serve as the core of such a team – so how's that for a rating of Haniyyah's skills, eh?

! Recap and Highlights
|-
| I
| The contestant known as Ajilenakh Dash specializes in using quick attacks and speed to gain an advantage, attacking her foes before they can react. Unfortunately, these tricks worked on neither the great Golden Comet, the Traveler, nor {{MC|his|her}} Silver Companion Paimon!<br>Their trump card, the Floating Hydro Fungus "Bongo-Head," skillfully used Mist Bubbles to restrict its opponents' movements, and before the mighty Bongo-Head, Ajilenakh Dash's team was completely unable to exploit their advantages, thus quickly handing the initiative over to out dynamic duo.<br>A very big thank you to both our contestants for providing us all with a fierce battle right out of the gate!
|-
| II
| What a brilliant contest that was! The battle between a legendary figure and a novelist was as dramatic as anyone could have hoped!<br>Souka's ace, Stormstress, possessed the ability to increase the spread of elemental power, but this could also be to the detriment of its teammates. The Golden Comet and the Silver Companion used this unique strength to quickly trap multiple opponents with Bongo-Head's Mist Bubbles, seizing the initiative in but an instant!<br>Thank you both, dear contestants! And do not be discouraged, Contestant Souka! I'm sure you'll put up an even more exciting performance next time!
|-
| III
| This was a true contest of "restraint," with Baron Bigfoot's trump card, "Gusto-Frosto," and the Golden Comet and Silver Companion's "Bongo-Head" being of the Cryo and Hydro elements respectively, and thus being unable to shake off the effects of the others' moves.<br>Thus did the two aces become the pivot around which the other Fungi in each team tried to reach a breakthrough. Ultimately, the Traveler and Paimon proved the more skilled party and relentlessly pursued their advantage, ultimately forcing Baron Bigfoot and Gusto-Frosto to lose too much ground to continue, forcing them to retire.<br>Many thanks once again to the contestants on both sides for giving us all a show unheard of in its many twists and turns.
|-
| IV
| The battle between Rocksteady and Bongo-Head can most straightforwardly be said to have been a battle between the "hard" and the "tough"!<br>At the beginning of the battle, Hardy Two-Blades sent Rocksteady at the forefront, commanding two elite Fungi right into the opposing formation! However, the Traveler and Paimon did not panic, and formed a defensive zone with Bongo-Head at its center. Once their opponents' edge was blunted, they went right for the jugular!<br>Many thanks to both parties – indeed, this was nothing if not a textbook example of counter-punch tactics in action!
|-
| V
| What a shocker! To think that the semifinals would have been such a heart-stopping yet enjoyable experience! Both parties came in determined to win, but kept that determination at just the right amount, bringing the battle to a whole new level!<br>Layla and the Traveler-Paimon combination displayed equal powers of observation and command, and their connection to their Ace Fungi was equally deep. The battle teetered back and forth so often that it is hard to describe what was happening with pure words. We strongly encourage both parties to watch the replays!<br>Once again, we'd like to thank both contestants! We're sure everyone looks forward to watching more matches like this one!
|-
| VI
| Due to the crimes committed by both the [[Kautilya|organizer]] and [[Elchingen|sponsor]] of this event, we employees have been dismissed after cooperating with the investigations. Even so, I wish to record this most exciting and important of matches!<br>Haniyyah is a beast tamer worth respecting indeed, for she has advocated for many long years that humans and wild creatures should live together in harmony, while the Traveler and Paimon have demonstrated the many ways in which this can be achieved using their path through the brackets. The two parties may have some ideological differences that lead to the fierce nature of this battle &mdash; for immediately the fight, in which Pyro-1 and Bongo-Head took center stage, devolved into an all-out melee! In the end, the Traveler, Paimon, and Bongo-Head clawed their way to an advantageous position through their greater will, forcing Haniyyah to the precipice of defeat. Yet it seems that amidst the battle, an understanding was reached, for they still shook hands after the match ended.<br>Either way, many thanks to both groups of contestants! Truly, they brought this tournament to a most fitting ending, bringing everyone new insights as to how humans and Fungi might learn to live together and cooperate in the future!

==Championship Results==
This text appears at the winner's place in the progress chart. Unlike other positions, this one has a background similar to a Wisdom Orb, and upper 2/3 of the screen are covered with an image of a golden medal with a design similar to that of a board atop the arena, hanging on a tri-colored strap (yellow, white and green).


"Golden Comet" Traveler and "Silver Companion" Paimon, together with their Ace Fungus "Bongo-Head," formed the winning combo of the first Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament!<br>
Based on a unique blend of their taming skills and a deep understanding of their Fungi's characteristics, the Traveler and Paimon exhibited extraordinary command capabilities and were able to turn the tables many a time. Not only have they won the tournament, but they have also passed the sponsor's Ultimate Trial. According to the rules of the competition, they now have the final say over the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament. And the responsibility for continuing to hold the tournament in the future also now falls on their shoulders!
