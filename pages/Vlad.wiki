==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
When the Fatui established the Northland Bank in Liyue Harbor, Vlad was assigned to serve as a guard for the bank.

One time, [[Nadia]] accidentally left her letter for her brother at the bank while changing shifts. Vlad, mistaking it as a letter written for him, left a response. Afterwards, the two became pen pals, writing letters for the other to read during their shifts.

The two meet for the first time during the [[Lantern Rite]] event and, while neither seems to realize that the other is their pen pal, they find their conversation nostalgic. In the [[:File:Version 1.3 "All That Glitters" Trailer - Genshin Impact|Version 1.3 trailer]], the two can be seen enjoying the festival together.

===Personality===
Vlad is extremely homesick, finding himself unable to fit in with the local people and has requested to return to Snezhnaya. While his request has yet to be processed, he hopes that it will be authorized so he could return home for other duties. The only person who makes him feel comfortable while he waits for the boat to return home is Nadia, although the two rarely get to meet as they work different shifts; in fact, the only time they are able to meet is during the Lantern Rite where they enjoy spending time together.

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Vlad:''' Hmm? Are you talking to me?
:'''Vlad:''' Sorry, it's been a while since someone has spoken to me, you literally caught me off guard.
:'''Vlad:''' But... I don't really wish to actively socialize with the people here.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Vlad:''' I am the guard here.
::'''Vlad:''' This is the Northland Bank, which was opened in Liyue by Snezhnaya. It's also the only non-local bank here in Liyue.
::'''Vlad:''' That's about all I know. If you would like to know more, you could talk to the manager.
:{{DIcon}} You don't want to socialize with others?
::'''Vlad:''' Well, I did try to fit in at first, but eventually I realized it was no use and just gave up.
::'''Vlad:''' Even though I've met a lot of people here, in the end, I couldn't help but still feel a certain distance between myself and them. I was never included as part of the group.
::'''Vlad:''' And socializing with them is exhausting. At this point, I've lost all interest in trying...
::'''Vlad:''' Perhaps there are just too many cultural differences.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Vlad:''' If you don't have any urgent matters, then you best be on your way. Idle chatter is not part of my duties here.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Vlad:''' Hmm? Are you talking to me?
:'''Vlad:''' Sorry, I was just reminiscing about my hometown.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Vlad:''' I'm waiting for a boat, a boat that will come at an unknown time, a boat that will take me home.
::'''Vlad:''' My name is Vlad. I was transferred from my home country of Snezhnaya to come work here in Liyue.
::'''Vlad:''' I've already been in this city for some time now, but clearly it's impossible for me to fit in here. So I've sent an application to headquarters to be transferred back home, but I don't know when the boat will arrive.
::'''Vlad:''' Even though I live here, I don't interact at all with the people of this city, except for just one person.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about that person.
::'''Vlad:''' She's also a guard at the Northland Bank like me, except I have the day shift, and she has the night shift.
::'''Vlad:''' It's as if I'm the sun, and she's the moon. Even though we're aware of one another's existence, our paths will never meet. I guess that's just how it's meant to be.
::'''Vlad:''' Then one day out of the blue, she left a letter for me right where we change the guard. We've been writing each other as pen pals ever since.
::'''Vlad:''' Although I can't wait for the boat to arrive, reading her letters is the only thing that makes my heart feel at ease.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Vlad:''' Goodbye. May the comfort of home never leave your side.
