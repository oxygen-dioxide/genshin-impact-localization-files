{{Dialogue end}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Freki:''' *sigh* My brother is so pathetic. He doesn't even dare to eat any of the food that he ordered himself.
:'''Freki:''' I've tried some of the food before, and that's just how it is!
:{{DIcon}} Do you dislike Liyue cuisine?
::'''Freki:''' It's not that I dislike it, let's just say that I'm... disappointed.
::'''Freki:''' Take Zhongyuan Chop Suey, for example. All the spices they use completely overwhelm the natural flavor of the ingredients. Apart from the powerful spicy and salty flavors, there's no taste of the actual ingredients.
::'''Freki:''' I had anticipated that it would be a more shocking taste, but I didn't at all expect this.
::'''Freki:''' We'll consult the Teyvat Travel Guide again to see where we should head next on our culinary journey.
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen somebody who looks similar to me?
::'''Freki:''' Similar looking to you... a sibling, you mean? Not that I remember.
::'''Freki:''' I understand how you must feel. If I were to get separated from my brother, I mean, if one of use wandered off and got lost or something, that would be... *sigh*
::'''Freki:''' In any case, I will help you keep an eye out during your travels. May you find them soon.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Freki:''' Goodbye. We'll be heading out shortly ourselves.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Freki:''' Lantern Rite certainly is exciting. The lively atmosphere sure is different from the festivals that we have back in Mondstadt.
:'''Freki:''' However, gourmets such as my brother and I do not revel in festivities and excitement. No, it is the delectable food and rare festival snacks we're after.
:'''Freki:''' I heard that the special dish for this year's Lantern Rite is [[Grilled Tiger Fish]], but after trying some myself, it seems like just ordinary Grilled Tiger Fish that you can get anytime.
:'''Freki:''' Perhaps only locals can distinguish the subtle variation in flavor?
:'''Freki:''' Oh, never mind. I'll just try some other snacks instead...
{{Dialogue end}}
===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Freki:''' *sigh* It's the Moonchase Festival, and the food here's only getting better... But my brother is still as weak as ever...
:'''Freki:''' I've heard that this iteration of Masterful Chefs has seen quite a few new dishes come to light. You know what? I'm just going to drag him off to try them all one by one!
:'''Freki:''' I'm pumped to try something different {{sic|form}} the usual fare. After all, they're just... you know, there.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Freki and Geri are both named after the {{w|Geri and Freki|two wolves}} that accompany Odin in Norse Mythology.
