'''Vishaps''' are a species of dragon-like creatures that once followed each of the [[Seven Sovereigns]] with their corresponding elements and were formerly the dominant race of the world. Over time, they will evolve into true [[Dragons]].

From each vishap species, the Seven Sovereigns will be born anew, so long as they remain biologically pure.

They belonged to the [[Light Realm|Vishap Realm]], also known as the Elemental Realm or the Light Realm.

* Vishaps lose the ability to differentiate color as they evolve.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Neuvillette|Would you like to chat?}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* Vishap is derived from the Armenian {{Lang|mini=1|hy=Վիշապ|hy_rm=vishap}}, an indigenous name for dragons, specifically those from Armenian mythology. Armenian dragons are traditionally imagined to be serpentine creatures and metaphysical manifestations in the world with ties to elements, commonly water and related concepts such as rain, thunderstorms and fertility.<ref>Armenian Wikipedia: {{lang|mini=1|hy={{w|hy:Վիշապ (գերբնական էակ)|Վիշապ (գերբնական էակ)}}|hy_tl=Dragon (supernatural being)}}</ref>
