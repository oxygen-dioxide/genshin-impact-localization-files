;(Talk to Sharp at Mondstadt City)
:'''Sharp:''' ...What do you think you're doing?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Sharp:''' Sharp.
::'''Sharp:''' Master Goth's PSD.
::'''Sharp:''' If you know the first thing about me, you'll keep away from my VIP.
::{{DIcon}} "PSD"?
:::'''Sharp:''' Tsk. Of course. You wouldn't know.
:::'''Sharp:''' PSD, personal security detachment. Bodyguard. We take the hit, so our clients don't have to.
:::'''Sharp:''' Personally, I much prefer "merc for hire." But now that I work for them, they've insisted on PSD.
::{{DIcon}} "VIP"?
:::'''Sharp:''' That one, over there. Marvin.
:::'''Sharp:''' My client. VIP, very important person. Very important to me, anyway, because he pays my wages.
:::'''Sharp:''' Master Goth's young... esquire.
:::'''Sharp:''' Tsk. They insist that I refer to him as "esquire." Well, what can I do? They pay my wages.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Sharp:''' Mm. On your way.

;(Talk to Sharp at Starsnatch Cliff)
:'''Sharp:''' What do you want?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Sharp:''' Master Goth pays me to protect his young esquire. His young esquire pays me to keep this a secret from his old man.
::'''Sharp:''' To get paid double, I just have to stay put and keep my mouth shut.
::'''Sharp:''' Hmph, look at them. Being all lovey-dovey when I'm right here watching. Young people these days have no sense of shame...
::'''Sharp:''' Wait a second... Are they getting a kick out of me watching them!?
::'''Sharp:''' Ugh, I cannot abide this!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Are you bored?
:::'''Sharp:''' Of course. After chasing the monsters away, I have absolutely nothing to do.
:::'''Sharp:''' Earlier, the young master asked me to help him pick some flowers, but he and that young lady started getting all lovey-dovey right away...
:::'''Sharp:''' What need do they have for flowers? I reckon the young master's forgotten all about it already.
:::'''Sharp:''' Do you want them? Just take them if you do. They're no use to me, anyhow.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Cecilia|20|x=5}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sharp:''' Scram!
