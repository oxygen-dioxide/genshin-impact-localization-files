'''HP Loss''' refers to the removal of a fixed amount or percentage of [[HP]] from a character or enemy. HP Loss ignores [[DEF]], [[RES]], [[Damage Reduction]], and [[Shields]].

HP Loss is not [[Damage]], and therefore cannot trigger passive effects that require taking damage, such as [[Serpent Spine]]'s stack loss.
