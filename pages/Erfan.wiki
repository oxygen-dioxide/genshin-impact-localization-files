{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Erfan:''' Pfft... Makes me laugh every time...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...
::'''Erfan:''' I am the one who walks under the veil of night, a listener of drunkards' most honest confessions...
::'''Erfan:''' Hahaha, just kiddin'! I'm just a bartender working night shifts here.
::'''Erfan:''' Many come here to drink at night. Some of them might get quite drunk. So [[Lambad]] had me take some of [[Qishan]]'s shifts.
::'''Erfan:''' An [[Akademiya]] student during the day and a bartender at night. I'd say I've managed to keep a good work-study balance.
:: {{DIcon}} About Qishan...
::'''Erfan:''' Qishan is the bartender during the day. Have you met her already?
::'''Erfan:''' She's a student from [[Liyue]] who is now preparing for the entrance exam to the Akademiya. She also works to cover her tuition. That's hardly an easy life.
::'''Erfan:''' I want to help, but I'm from a different school than the one she's aiming for.
::'''Erfan:''' So I sometimes invite students from that school over for a drink. This way, she can discuss academic questions with them.
::'''Erfan:''' I hope she will pass the exam. That will make me her senior!
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything fun about this place?
::'''Erfan:''' Of course, there's lots of fun stuff.
::'''Erfan:''' This is a tavern, after all. The last thing we lack is funny drunkards.
::'''Erfan:''' Like last time, a student who had just come of age drank too much at his birthday party and, as a result, tried to have a duel with a chair.
::'''Erfan:''' ...Well, the chair definitely turned out to be the stronger duelist.
::'''Erfan:''' A Liyue student who came with him captured the hilarious moment and sent the pictures to [[The Steambird]] overnight.
::'''Erfan:''' Guess what, one of the pictures earned the Second Prize for journalistic photography. I heard it was only second to the work of The Steambird's top reporter.
::'''Erfan:''' If I were the drunken student, I'd blackmail... send a letter to ask for royalties.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Erfan:''' Goodbye... Hahaha...

:'''Erfan:''' What a blunder... I won't get to watch the competitions during the day if I'm working nights!
:'''Erfan:''' That said... ah, I can't just dip work and go see the competition during the day, haha.
:'''Erfan:''' Keeping that in mind gives me some balance. Maybe my classmates might fill me in on what's happening in the competition over some drinks at night.
:'''Erfan:''' With the gala comes more tourists, and with more tourists comes an increase to my pay. I might even hear some new drunken jokes! Seems like I'm being well compensated for my time!

==Trivia==
* Erfan's [[Darshan]] is unknown, but it is different than the one Qishan aims to enter.
** Given Qishan's pronounced interest in shipbuilding, it may be assumed that she is aiming to enter [[Kshahrewar]], as it is the Darshan most focused on mechanics and technology; this rules out Kshahrewar as Erfan's school affiliation.
