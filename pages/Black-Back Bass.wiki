Catching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[archive]].

==Trivia==
*The Black-Back Bass may be inspired by a combination of the namesake of any fish with the black-back pattern in real-life, including anatomy of a {{w|Bass (fish)|bass}}.
**If this is the case, it may explain why all [[Bass|bass variants]] can be found in both freshwater bodies, lakes and rivers, and in saltwater, at the sea.
