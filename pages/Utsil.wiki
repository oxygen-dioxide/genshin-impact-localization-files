==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Utsil:''' Mmm, if I play like this next time, an epic victory will be mine!
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Utsil knows)
:::'''Utsil:''' Thanks to the [[Qucusaur]]s' protection, everything's going great! The Riders did espy some reflective objects from their vantage point &mdash; ore, if I had to guess.
:::'''Utsil:''' By the way, did you know that gem-related cards have some rather intriguing uses... Sorry, bit off-topic. If you need Magic Crystal Ore or something, you can just head over here.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Utsil knows)
:::'''Utsil:''' Everything's fine. If I had to complain about anything, it's that no one's got time to play cards with me... But now that I think about it, I'm at work right now myself.
:{{DIcon}} Victory in what?
::'''Utsil:''' In a duel, of course!
::'''Utsil:''' I've got all the [[Saurian]] blessing cards &mdash; I mean, all the Saurian cards &mdash; plus a deck with Saurian feathers... *ahem* I mean, the latest custom cards...
::'''Utsil:''' So I'll be invincible come the next match! Victory is 100% guaranteed to the proudest of players &mdash; and that's me, bay-bee!
::'''Utsil:''' Of course, I still have to thank my teacher, [[Acat]], for carefully drawing up a deck of Qucusaurus cards for me. I wish her business at [[Chuwen Fair]] all the prosperity it deserves.
::{{DIcon}} I thought you were talking about combat...
::'''Utsil:''' Ah, if it's combat we're talking about, then the cool factor doesn't really apply, right? That's a whole different kettle of fish from tabletop card games.
::'''Utsil:''' I may have gotten a little heated just now when talking about [[Genius Invokation TCG]], but please don't paint me as some sort of battle-freak.
::'''Utsil:''' Even if a warrior staggers off the battlefield, if they defeat their enemy and make it back home alive, then they're the final winners nonetheless.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} This is pretty cool too.
:::'''Utsil:''' ...I tried to imagine it, and what you said does make sense.
:::'''Utsil:''' But I must say, the battlefield's no place for those who just want to look cool! Winning is what matters.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Teachings of Conflict|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Good luck.
::'''Utsil:''' I will, because I've got the blessing of the Saurians!
