|description = A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.<br>These lizards have lovely green scales and will discard their tails to escape when caught.<br>Lizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.<br>Once they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up.
