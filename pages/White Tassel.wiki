==Description==
The Millelith Soldiers are renowned the world over for their skilled use of polearm weapons.<br>
The signature white-tasseled halberd they wield is mass-produced at the [[Blackcliff Forge]].<br>
It is a weapon that has stood the test of countless bloody battles over centuries of history.<br>
For even when the smoke of the battlefield stained the tassel a murky shade of gray, it would wave proudly and defiantly like a flag in the wind.

The army once had in its ranks a legendary master of the polearm.<br>
He could hit his target from miles away without staining its tassel.<br>
"The legend is that of the polearm's bearer..."<br>
"Not the polearm itself, which was entirely ordinary."<br>
The old smith smacked his apprentice.<br>
He demanded a white tassel for the newly made polearm.
