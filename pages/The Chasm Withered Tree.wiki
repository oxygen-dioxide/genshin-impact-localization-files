'''The Chasm Withered Tree''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a location in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]], [[Liyue]] north of [[The Chasm: Main Mining Area]].

[[Paimon]] mentions that it shares some resemblance to an ancient white tree from [[Dragonspine]], likely referring to the white tree where the [[Princess' Box]] is found in [[Dragonspine's Last Trio]]. As of [[Version 3.3]], the withered tree cannot be interacted with.

;(Approach tree)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, there's a strange withered tree over here! It looks just like that ancient white tree from [[Dragonspine]]...
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* There are identical Withered Trees on [[Dragonspine]], [[Tsurumi Island]] near the shore where [["Boatman"]] can be found, and beside the central island in [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]]. The Chasm tree is however, the only one that triggers dialogue upon approach.
