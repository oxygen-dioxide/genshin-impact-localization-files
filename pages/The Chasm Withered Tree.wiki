'''The Chasm Withered Tree''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a location in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]], [[Liyue]] north of [[The Chasm: Main Mining Area]].

The withered tree cannot be interacted with. [[Paimon]] mentions that it shares some resemblance to an ancient white tree from [[Dragonspine]], likely referring to the white tree where the [[Princess' Box]] is found in [[Dragonspine's Last Trio]].

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach tree)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, there's a strange withered tree over here! It looks just like that ancient white tree from [[Dragonspine]]...
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* Although there are identical Withered Trees on [[Dragonspine]], [[Tsurumi Island]] near the shore where [["Boatman"]] can be found, and beside the central island in [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]], the Chasm tree is the only one that triggers dialogue upon approach.
