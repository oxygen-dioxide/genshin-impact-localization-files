'''The Chasm Withered Tree''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a location in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]], [[Liyue]] north of [[The Chasm: Main Mining Area]].

[[Paimon]] mentions that it shares some resemblance to an ancient white tree from [[Dragonspine]], likely referring to the white tree where the [[Princess' Box]] is found in [[Dragonspine's Last Trio]]. As of current, the withered tree cannot be interacted with.
